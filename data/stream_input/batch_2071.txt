B003XT603Q|5.0|Norwegian Wood is the second novel by Haruki Murakami that I've read, after a friend recommended Kafka on the Shore several years ago. There is something about the direct, simple writing style that Murakami employs that is incredibly refreshing. It also makes his books hard to put down. The main character in Norwegian Wood has a detached, unaffected personality that somewhat resembles Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye, but Murakami embraces this connection, and even pokes fun at it a few times throughout the book. Norwegian Wood isn't exactly the most uplifting book, but it's a captivating story of love and lust.

1400031567|1.0|This is a good Swedish novel, but it is not his best by a long shot.  The book is a good one, don't get me wrong.  It just struggles to keep up with the snail.  This was disappointing as I read \\"The Troubled Man\\" and it was an excellent book.  I made a note to myself to read some more Mankell books.  And I hear that other Mankell novels are very good, also.  But, \\"Sidetracked\\", while a good mystery story, was just a bit sluggish.  You had to put it down every now and then.<br /> To start with, the plot is very suspect.  A young girl from the Dominican Republic sets herself afire in a rapeseed field.  In a seemingly, unrelated crime, a perp dressed barefoot with war paint on his face armed with an axe, kills and scalps his victim.  Yes, a bit far-fetched for Sweden.<br />The Swedish Indian continues on his spree with some interesting targets.  There seems to be a method to his madness.  The team just cannot figure it out.  It seems that he is building up to a crescendo.  However, one victim does not fit into the mix whatsoever.  The team cannot figure it out for the like of them.  It is giving them fits.  The manhunt heats up.  The team works frantically.  The police get close.  They get off-track.  They get hot; they get cold.<br />The problem is that even when the book gets interesting, the interest sizzles out soon.  Also, Mankell's writing is very detailed.  It is much more detailed than an American murder mystery writer.  The books are much deeper than their American counterparts.<br />Although I really did like the book, I will still give it a 1-star rating.  It was a good book, just not the best book. It was definitely not Mankell's best effort.  I hope that noone that picks up this book first of his to read will give him a second chance because he does better writing.<br /><br />Cam

0765325950|3.0|I never really believed that this series could ever end. It seemed to go on forever , and its certainly true , when stated that there are no ending to the wheel of time , but that this was one ending.  A lot of plot lines were shut off with a very abrupt feel , but otherwise everything was wrapped up , which is something. Very, fast paced and the battle scenes were very vivid . Hoped for more , can't be blamed for that , but still for such a long series a justifiable ending .

B00006FDCD|4.0|The small town of Derry is terrorized by a nameless evil that has taken shape as a murderous clown. When the town's children begin to disappear, it is up to a group of school friends known as \\"The Loser Club\\" to gather their courage and end It's reign of terror. Thirty years later, the evil returns, and the group is called back as adults to defeat the demon once and for all. IT is one of the single most horrifying viewing experiences in anyone's life. How many childhoods have been ruined by IT, and how many more must suffer at the hands of Pennywise the Clown? While this two-part television event is only a mild retelling of Stephen King's best-selling novel, it manages to produce some of the most disturbing images known to man. If you weren't already scared of clowns going into the film, you sure as hell will be going out. It is impossible to sleep at night knowing that the photo album, the sink, or even a friendly balloon are likely to sneak up on you and drench you in blood like they do in the film. IT perfectly captures childhood fears in a way that is still terrifying to adults. There are no words to describe just how frightening Tim Curry's performance is as the killer clown. He hides more menace in a smile than a snarl, and the nightmarish ways in which he lures children to their deaths can never be forgotten. The plot still plays well even after the the paring down of Stephen King's over-indulgent characters, though many of the performances often falter. Really, Tommy Lee Wallace has done the best he can given the incredible length of the novel and the constraints of televised horror, but despite its flaws, IT will always remain one of the scariest films ever made.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B001EBWIRW|5.0|A poor plant keeper finds love and success after nursing a rare carnivorous plant back to health, but the plant soon begins demanding more than just blood to survive... LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is back in business thanks to Frank Oz' brightly-lit remake as adapted from Ashman and Menken's Broadway musical. Seymour returns, this time played by the sheepish Rick Moranis who is in love with his shrill co-worker Audrey (Ellen Greene). Only Audrey's abusive boyfriend and a giant man-eating plant stand between true love, which leaves Seymour with quite the quandary... Moranis and Greene are inseparable on screen, each delivering playful performances along with the over-the-top cameos by Steve Martin and Bill Murray. Legendary filmmaker Frank Oz has unleashed some of his finest work in the Audrey II plant, which is brilliantly brought to life using only the most imaginative special effects that puppetry will allow. When coupled with the memorable music numbers, sharp wit, and satire of the script, LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS becomes a true classic that even supersedes the dark humor of the original.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B003EY62II|3.0|Scooby and the gang of Mystery, Inc. are invited to Spooky Island to try and solve a case where some sinister madman is transforming wild teenagers into mild-mannered college students using ancient voodoo rituals! The classic cartoon capers of Mystery, Inc. have finally reached the silver screen in SCOOBY DOO, but this isn't the film that fans have been waiting for. James Gunn's script pokes fun at the cartoon series, which is fine since the show is rife for parody, but the characters he creates and the overall mood of the entire picture lack the spirit of the original television show. For all of the extravagant sets and big name actors, one would hope that director Raja Gosnell could have invested a little more time and money into the ugly computerization that was used for Scooby and the monsters. Even if the creatures were made to look cartoony to avoid frightening the children in the audience, it does not excuse the tacky special effects. Sadly, the film doesn't even include so much as a cameo by any of the classic monsters, and instead adopts a whole new set of villains that kids are unlikely to remember. In trying to be hip to modern, SCOOBY DOO loses much of its magic, and makes Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze look like a couple of buffoons on screen. Only Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini truly capture the essense of the original characters. Had the makers gone with the initial plans to make this a campy throwback to the 70's like in THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, the film may have worked, but unfortunately SCOOBY DOO is a wasted opportunity that is unlikely to please generations new or old.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B005ZO6NRA|3.0|The ill-conceived CONAN THE BARBARIAN remake is an absolute mess of a film that places bloody violence and over-budgeted effects over character and story. While it attempts to remain closer to the works of Robert E. Howard, it lacks the heart and epic qualities of Howard's writing. The casting is like a bad joke. Jason Momoa may look the part, but his over-confidence and exaggerated expressions come off as being silly instead of stern and powerful. There is no consistency whatsoever in the accents or dialects of the various groups of people that Conan encounters in his travels. The world of Hyboria is dramatically reduced as a result, especially considering how quickly Conan is able to travel from land to land in search of his betrayers. Most of the story and background are related by an unseen narrator, who quickly tries to piece things together for the audience in between the overblown action sequences. Zym is a bland and forgettable villain that would cower before James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom. What is worse, the grand scheme that has taken him over 20 years of battling and searching to complete is spoiled in one brief and unsatisfying final conflict. This consists mostly of unbelievable feats and unnecessary computerization. The only entertainment comes from the absurd amount of bloodshed and heavy reliance on nude wenches. For mindless sword-fighting and mayhem, CONAN is a serviceable action flick, but in all other ways, it is utterly underwhelming.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B000ICZD5M|4.0|Enter the world of Dune, a far-off desert planet that has been the center of an intergalactic struggle for a rare spice used in space travel. A young warrior must rise up to become the prophet of legend who will free the planet and end the tyrannical reign of the corrupt Emperor. David Lynch's quasi-masterpiece may be plagued with countless inconsistencies and unfinished effects, but considering the hulking scale of the production, it remains a Science Fiction classic of epic proportions! Kyle MacLachlan plays the hero of legend, the noble son of a rebellious leader who must awaken the mystical powers within him to become the Muad'Dib, or messiah. Though rushed, Lynch's film adequately demonstrates author Frank Herbert's original intentions to use DUNE as a futuristic allegory of the 'superhero complex,' where society is all too willing to give up their control to one whose powers and persuasion far outweigh their own. He pulls from the novel's rich universe to create a galaxy that is filled with different races, languages, creatures, and technologies. In light of other early 80's blockbusters like Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER, many of the special effects in DUNE appear to be about a decade behind the times, although the same can't be said for the film's breathtaking set designs. Two distinct cuts exist at the present time, neither of which the director has been satisfied with. Despite containing over an hour of additional footage, even the extended edition is considered to be critically flawed, but DUNE still has the power to transport us to a world beyond our imagination.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Let me get this out the door: Journey to the Center of the Earth is a very cheesy and campy movie. It is has the most cliché one-liners, and corny dialogue. Yet, that doesn't stop the movie from being an exhilarating 3D adventure. For those that are fortunate enough to own a 3D TV, the 3D in this movie is very fun. Depth is always there, and there are some fun pop-outs through out the movie (Yes they know they are gimmicky). Within the first minute of the movie, there is an awesome pop-out that stretches way out of the screen. The picture quality is another story, during some scenes, there is a pinkish hue, a blueish hue, and a greenish hue that really takes away from the picture quality. However, if this doesn't bother you, i highly suggest buying this movie. At $14.99, it was a steal. However, I am not sure if this is still the price. I would pick this up if you found it for under $19.99.
B00005N5RM|4.0|An amorphous organism comes crashing down to Earth, where it begins absorbing the locals as it grows and grows into THE BLOB! THE BLOB is reborn using state-of-the-art special effects in the 1988 remake, one of the better Science Fiction films to be remade in the 80's following John Carpenter's THE THING. Chuck Russell molds the updated screenplay around germ warfare and Reagan Era politics at the close of the Cold War. The drama unfolds like a bad episode of 90210 for the predominantly teen cast, but that really isn't what the film is about here. It is about melting as many people as possible into slimy goo, and no film does it better than THE BLOB! Several of the most graphic and shockingly unexpected death scenes from the 1980's come out of THE BLOB, and no one is safe when the creature consumes men, women, AND children! We watch as people are liquified on screen, with their arms and faces dripping off from the creature's acidic jelly. The Blob was brought to life by a young Tony Gardner using an array of inventive practical and visual effects that hold up considerably well even decades after its release. THE BLOB is a good old-fashioned monster movie that has been bloodied up for modern audiences, and it sure is fun to watch!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
0790731002|3.0|This film was great with one minor and one major flaw. The minor flaw was having Val Kilmer playing Batman. He's not the right person to play such a popular character. And the major flaw was including The Riddler in this film. Adding in a great Batman villain, but who acts like a 4 year old. I believe that this role for Jim Carrey lowered his career a bit. He was like a bug the you wish would just go away. I believe that this movie was good enough with Tommy Lee Jones playing as Two-Face. Now that he was fun to watch.<br /><br />I would give this film a much better rating only if The Riddler was not in it, but because he is, he ruined most of the movie.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|Alice returns to destroy the evil Umbrella Corporation once and for all, but her journey leaves her trapped with a small band of survivors in an abandoned prison compound that is surrounded by thousands of the undead. It will be up to her to find an escape and lead the group to the safe haven known as Arcadia. Paul W.S. Anderson has outdone himself once again in RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE, creating the most mindless and over-budgeted entry in the series. Anderson's complete lack of concern for story and character is more apparent than ever. From beginning to end, there is no progression or expansion on any of the events from the previous films. It is an unnecessary chapter at best, and a boring one at that. Several new characters are introduced from the video game series, only to be given fewer lines and background than they had in their playable forms. The one place where RESIDENT EVIL continues to excel is in the fast-paced and explosive action sequences, although most are self-indulgent attempts to exploit the 3-D gimmick used in the film's theatrical release. Unfortunately, the open ending lends proof that Anderson's career will continue onward to bigger (but not better) things.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B004LWZW4W|4.0|Go back to where it all began in RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES! A brilliant researcher has developed a new serum that has the potential to cure Alzheimer's, but when his test subjects are killed following after a failed experiment, he is left with only one chimp. Will raises Caesar as his own, as his intelligence begins to grow at an alarming rate. After a freak attack against one of the neighbors, Caesar is forced into a wildlife rescue, where he and each of the other animals are abused and tormented by their jailers, forcing Caesar to rally the other apes in a revolt against humanity!<br /><br />RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES provides a fitting beginning to the fall of mankind, although a sequel certainly seems eminent. Rupert Wyatt brings the film to life using astounding special effects and heart-pounding action that are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat! Although James Franco and John Lithgow attempt to inject some forced sentimentality into the earlier scenes, the main focus always remains on our anti-hero chimp, Caesar. Through cutting-edge motion capture technology, Andy Serkis is able to give this fully-computerized character true life, with personality, heart, and soul that read through his eyes and expressions. Caesar gains sympathy and support in his struggles against mankind, as he suffers time and time again at the hands of his captors. Watching RISE is a bit of an Easter egg hunt as well, with clever cameos and allusions to the other films embedded playfully throughout the script. The only real misstep is that the long running time only provides the beginning to the beginning of the story, and never amounts to the full-scale planetary take-over by the super-intelligent apes. The strengths and successes will surely allow for a continuation in the next chapter, however.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B0051OZ564|4.0|Baby Doll imagines an elaborate fantasy world in which she plans her escape from a corrupt mental facility after being institutionalized by her abusive stepfather in Zack Snyder's SUCKER PUNCH from 2011. SUCKER PUNCH is a visual knock-out with mind-blowing special effects and non-stop action that will leave you breathless! Snyder has assembled the perfect cast for this exploitation/fantasy cross-over that take the otherwise empty characters and blow them up into larger-than-life super-heroes. SUCKER PUNCH pushes teen fetishism to the edge with its ultra-sexy heroines that are armed to the teeth with swords and guns, taking on everything from dragons to samurai warriors, undead Nazi soldiers, and futuristic androids in their skimpy schoolgirl outfits. It is so easy to become entranced by the cute girls, stunning fantasy worlds, and huge explosions that minor things like plot and character hardly seem to matter.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The suspense left me unable to put it down. I think this is an excellent series with lessons to be learned. It certainly isn't a fairytale but dystopian literature rarely is. I love that we get to know past winning tributes more intimately and the arena in this book is so much more complex bringing that extra bit of intrigue the first book lacked. We saw some personal sacrifice in the first novel but this one is full of it on so many different levels. Read this book. You won't regret it and you won't regret reading the final book either. The Hunger Games is an amazing story.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|With the help of her friend Anna, Lucie seeks out the group that held her captive as a child in order to earn her revenge, but what they will find in the family's terrible house of horrors will be worse than anything they could have ever imagined. Somewhere beyond the darkest depths of Hell lies MARTYRS, a film of such unspeakable horror that it becomes unbearable to watch. It is not that the film is shocking, graphic, or repulsive, but that it is all of these things taken in the extreme. MARTYRS rapes the senses and apologizes for nothing. It begs the questions: Why? Is this art? Who could have conceived this? What is there to gain in the making of this film? You continue watching as things go from bad to worse to worse to worse, until finally you realize that this film was not meant to entertain. In fact, it probably wasn't meant for human consumption. It only exists because it had to. What makes MARTYRS that much more unacceptable is how well the film is made. MARTYRS is well cast, well shot, and very well acted. The visceral screen violence is ultra-realistic, and nauseating at that. Pascal Laugier reduces his characters to a level far below humanity. The man is a genius, but he is also wildly insane. Once you have seen MARTYRS, you cannot unsee it, so prepare yourself. Things will get ugly.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B000IMUYJM|5.0|The girls of the Pi Kappa Sigma sorority are receiving threatening phone calls on Christmas Eve, but little do they know that they are coming from a killer that is hiding inside the house! Unappreciated in its time and still surprisingly unseen by many, BLACK CHRISTMAS nevertheless remains one of the most influential films in the pre-Slasher cycle, and an unsung classic of modern Horror. Calls coming from within the house, a faceless, motiveless killer, an auspicious holiday setting, a house filled with terrified co-eds, the chilling first-person perspective of the killer. Many of these defining characteristics first appeared in BLACK CHRISTMAS, a full four years before John Carpenter would release HALLOWEEN.<br /><br />BLACK CHRISTMAS introduces us to an excellent cast of characters who, though conventional, show a great deal of personal identity. We have Margot Kidder who plays an all-too-convincing drunken bitch, a bumbling and smart-mouthed house mother Mrs. Mack, the beautiful Olivia Hussey in the lead, and film legend John Saxon as the cunning police chief who is out to stop the killer. The actors help to balance the even blend of dark humor and horror that Bob Clark has written in to each of their lines. No character is ever 'offed' in any simple manner; each of their deaths are as violent as they are unique and memorable. Clare's asphyxiation atop the rocking chair holds the same impact and horror as Argento's opening strangulation in SUSPIRIA.<br /><br />Bob Clark instills a constant sense of dread despite the cheerful holiday setting. The old, dark house provides an ominous setting for his characters to roam, as the camera effortlessly floats through its hallways with all of the style and grace of the great Mario Bava. The suspense never ends in BLACK CHRISTMAS, and neither does the mystery. The audience is left guessing as to the identity of the killer all the way to the very end. There is no safety or solace to be found in the closing scene; in fact, the night has just begun for poor Jess! Though many are killed throughout the film, very little is actually shown. Instead, Clark tastefully alludes to the extreme acts of violence off-camera. This would be reversed in the 2006 remake. Utterly.<br /><br />Before his tragic death in 2007, Bob Clark revealed that an ambitious film student once asked him what he would do if he were to ever make a sequel to BLACK CHRISTMAS. Clark stated that he would set it one year later in the same house. The killer was caught, but has escaped from the mental institute to resume killing. He would call it HALLOWEEN. Who else would ask but a young John Carpenter, the known opportunist who would go on to make the similarly titled (and themed) Horror classic. Whether Carpenter truly stole his ideas from here or not is largely irrelevant at this point, but BLACK CHRISTMAS deserves rightful recognition for establishing many key elements of the Slasher genre that are commonly ascribed to HALLOWEEN. It is a wonderfully dark and brooding film that should be at the top of every Horror fan's list!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesnight has just begun for poor Jess!

B002N14GPE|3.0|A family of four is torn apart after adopting a seemingly sweet and intelligent Russian girl. Her mysterious past catches up with them as a series of accidents befall the family members and anyone else that crosses Esther's path. ORPHAN was a big hit upon its release in 2009, despite its many setbacks that keep it from becoming a classic in the killer kids genre. The character of Esther is written and played far too menacingly for her to remain unnoticed. There is no ambiguity in her actions, as she is clearly portrayed as being evil from the very start. As a result, much of the film relies on the shock of her actions rather than the build up or suspense leading up to them. It does, however, manage to maintain the mystery behind her shady background long enough to give the audience one final surprise! Esther's adopted parents are easily the most frustrating parents in recent Horror. Her crackpot mother is irritating and irresponsible, while her idiot father stands completely oblivious to her evil ways in light of the horrible tragedies that are affecting his family. They gain no sympathy or support as a result. If films were graded solely on their twist endings, ORPHAN would rate at the top of its class, but the carelessness of the writing cannot be overcome by the clean cinematography or Isabelle Fuhrman's creepy performance as Esther.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B000SP3DE2|4.0|Francis Ford Coppola gives the ageless vampire a terrifying new update in 1992's DRACULA. Coppola uniquely adapts the letters and journal entries from the original novel onto the screen in this stylish retelling. DRACULA may be the single most horrifying film of the 90's. Its lavish set pieces drip Gothic allure while its abominable creature designs have escaped from a world of nightmares. Why, then, did Coppola decide to drag it through the mud by hiring such an inappropriate cast? Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder couldn't have been worse choices as Jonathan Harker and Mina Murray. Judging by the film, one might think that Dracula drains his victims of talent. Their despondent performances dispel the romantic fantasy that is unraveling all around them. The great Anthony Hopkins has his hands in the matter too, with a boisterous take on Professor Van Helsing that comes across as a drunken fool. Despite his dramatic overacting, Gary Oldman proves himself the actor of the bunch, and puts forth a performance that is chilling to the bone. Just one look at his withered old Count is enough to make the skin crawl, and the buxom brides that stalk his chambers are none less frightening. From a visual standpoint, Francis Ford Coppola has directed a masterpiece of Gothic cinema, but for all of its lurid style and grace, DRACULA lacks soul.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B0002KVULG|4.0|Dracula returns in the 1979 retelling of the classic tale as directed by John Badham. This rendition, which was similarly adapted from the Broadway play by Deane and Balderston, has undergone a number of noticeable changes in the plot and characters to give the film a unique life of its own. Frank Langella stars as the infamous Count, bringing with him the same youthful exuberance and seductive charm that earned him a nomination for the Tony Awards on stage. His captivating screen presence and overt sexualization of the role make this a refreshing new take on the old familiar character. Langella is joined by film legends Donald Pleasence and Laurence Olivier as Dr. Jack Seward and Professor Van Helsing, along with Kate Nelligan, Trevor Eve, and Jan Francis. The battle of wills between Olivier and Langella in their first conflict exerts an enormous amount of power and tension that makes the screen tremble. DRACULA is also filled with thrilling special effects, including the villain's first vertical descent down the castle walls, and several transformations into wolf and bat. The image of the pale-faced and ruby-eyed Mina that is discovered feeding on the town's children is beyond terrifying. John Williams sets the mood with a chilling score as well. John Badham's DRACULA is often overlooked and highly underrated, and ranks among the best film versions of the character to date.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B004EPYZXK|3.0|In 1972, the Department of Defense launches Apollo 18 on a secret mission to the moon. Objective: Unknown. Its crew would never return. Nearly 30 years later, their footage has been found. If you aren't already a fan of the \\"found-footage\\" genre, APOLLO 18 is unlikely to change that fact, but for anyone who enjoys watching in horror through the shaky first-person perspective of the camera will find this to be another fresh new take on the format. Director Gonzalo L&oacute;pez-Gallego has taken great care in making every scene feel authentic by properly aging the footage and dressing down the technology to fit the early 1970's. The cramped space station and craterous moon setting add the the believability, and allow for a suspension of disbelief as we travel alongside the cosmonauts in zero-gravity. While this particular style does lend credibility to the plot, it is also cause for a lot of expected slow-downs in the pace, with the action being spread thin throughout the entire run-time. Fear and paranoia do set in much like in THE THING once the men discover that there is life on other worlds. An interesting use of the format to be sure, APOLLO 18 nevertheless reaches the limit of its own high concept quickly as the audience eagerly awaits any signs of life from the film.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B000035Z3K|4.0|In 1931, the face of Horror would be changed forever as Carl Laemmle Jr. and Universal Studios introduced the world to two of their most famous monsters: Dracula and Frankenstein. DRACULA has secured its place in history not for its cinematic quality, but rather for being the first of a new era of monster movies that would dominate the genre for more than a decade. Its influence in shaping later films, however, can never be denied.<br /><br />After acquiring the deed to a private estate in London, the vampiric Count Dracula sets out into the night to extend his own life with the blood of his innocent victims. Dracula soon becomes enthralled with the beautiful Mina Seward, whose father owns the neighboring sanitarium. Fearing for his daughter's safety, Dr. Seward enlists the help of the renown Professor Van Helsing, who comes to the conclusion that the recent rash of deaths are somehow connected to Nosferatu, the vampire. It is up to Van Helsing to identify the vampire and stop him from entering young Mina into a world of eternal darkness!<br /><br />It was decided early on that DRACULA would be adapted for the screen from the Broadway play of Bram Stoker's classic novel. Its roots in the theater are ever apparent, given the rigid performances by the cast and Tod Browning's listless direction. After the first act, the pacing suffers dramatically up until the anticlimactic ending. The absence of music is also quite apparent throughout the film, although the deathly silence sends shivers down the spine as Dracula and his brides first arise from the ancient graves. Atmospheric moments such as this and Dracula's grand descent down the ruinous castle stairway have helped to define the Gothic Horror genre.<br /><br />Edward Van Sloan is very good as the calculative Professor Van Helsing, whereas Helen Chandler seems entirely detached and disinterested as Ms. Mina. Dwight Frye's portrayal of Dracula's deranged assistant Renfield is the most entertaining of the bunch, often recalling the exaggerated performances from the German Expressionist era.<br /><br />What truly sets DRACULA apart is the man behind the monster: Bela Lugosi. The Hungarian-born actor had already won critical acclaim for his portrayal of the character on the stage, and although he was not the first choice for Browning's filmed version (a role that was originally intended for the great Lon Chaney), his legacy will be forever linked to this performance. Lugosi's thick Hungarian accent and countless charm mesmerize the audience just as they do the characters on screen. He is equally terrifying and captivating at the same time.<br /><br />While the 1931 version of DRACULA is far from perfect, its historical and cultural significance on world cinema makes it a true classic. Bela Lugosi has since become an icon in the eyes of the public, which will continue to feed DRACULA's eternal life for centuries to come.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesrecalling the exaggerated performances from the German Expressionist era.<br /><br />What truly sets DRACULA apart is the man behind the monster: Bela Lugosi.

B001EC2ISA|5.0|Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, BEETLEJUICE!! 'The Ghost with the Most' is brought back from the afterlife thanks to Tim Burton's twisted imagination and the wacky writings of Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren. In order to rid themselves of a pesky new family, a recently deceased couple hires the obnoxious ghoul Beetlejuice to perform a \\"bio-exorcism\\" and earn back their house! BEETLEJUICE is filled with oddball characters and eccentric performances from the entire cast. HOME ALONE's Catherine O'Hara is wickedly funny as the family's New Age hipster wife, who is married to Jeffrey Jones in another of his quirky character roles. A young Winona Ryder plays their morbid daughter Lydia, the one person who is able to communicate with the dead. And then, of course, there is Michael Keaton in the most unusual and unexpected performances of his career. Beetlejuice is crass, vulgar, and disgusting... And we love him! He is the undead equivalent to the classic Acme characters pushed to their fiendish extremes. The make-up and special effects are superb and highly original, combining traditional stop-motion animation with modern prosthetics to bring each of the otherworldly creatures back to life. Like GREMLINS and GHOSTBUSTERS before it, BEETLEJUICE is another classic comedy that 80's horror fans are sure to love!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B003TNM2K6|5.0|A strange mist has overtaken the town of Bridgton, Maine, bringing with it creatures of unimaginable horror! As a small group struggles to survive within the local grocery, they will find that the real monsters are much more human... Frank Darabont gives us a modern twist on the classic monster movie in his stunning adaptation of Stephen King's THE MIST from 2007. Darabont sets a slow and deliberate pace in a small setting with minimal score to force the characters to the forefront of the film in a big way. The cramped grocery store becomes a microcosm of the outside world, and one that harbors fierce rivalries and personal politics that turn man against man. The real terror does not come from the Lovecraftian creatures lurking in the mist, but rather from the horrors that man will bring upon himself once the veil of civilization has been lifted. Although it is a striking character drama at its roots, that does not stop THE MIST from doubling as a frightening creature feature as well! From tentacled beasts to spindly spiders, THE MIST unleashes a horde of monstrous creations with a taste for blood. Thomas Jane provides a strong lead for the other characters to stand behind, but Marcia Gay Harden stands out the most as this generation's Piper Laurie, playing the religious nut that demands blood sacrifices to appease an angry God. THE MIST also features one of the most downturn endings of all-time. Though released to theaters in color, a black and white version can be found on the special edition DVD, and offers a whole new way to experience the film as it was originally intended. THE MIST is a powerful horror film that ranks as one of the best in 2007.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B00ARN0XGG|2.0|This isn't one of those reviews that exists just to pan the entire series and bemoan their continued existence. I found part one genuinely scary and while not as good, I still liked part two. But something started to go wrong with part 3. The whole retcon with this Toby character, mythology from the first two parts ignored, and the stereotypical Satanic coven were just the worst. Not to mention, the trailer for 3-which contained almost no footage from the actual movie-looked like a much better film.<br /><br />With all of that, I was looking side-eyes at part 4, but I gave in and rented it anyway. For this entry, we are back in the present with a new family in Henderson, Nevada. We are reminded pointedly in the prologue that Katie and little Hunter from part 2 are still missing. There is a creepy little boy and his never seen mother next door. This mysterious mother gets sick and asks the new family to care for creepy kid while she's in the hospital. And things get weird.<br /><br />If you've seen any of these films, you know the drill. Unexplained bumps in the night (and day) lead to levitating objects and eventually people. Long sequences of watching a person sleep or read or whatever are suddenly punctuated by jump scares. Even in part 3, these long sequences had occasional payoffs. While I wasn't a particular fan of that entry, there were a few scary scenes I rewound and watched again. Alas, I can't imagine anyone being frightened by this uninspired entry. Toby's actions this time are largely pointless and lame until the very end (and even then, I couldn't bring myself to be very interested.) Not to mention, the story just doesn't make much sense and it seems to contravene its own mythology. Which, given that we are at part 4 now, isn't that surprising, I guess. What exactly is \\"Toby\\" trying to accomplish at this point anyway?<br /><br />And just like in part 3, hardly anything from the trailer was in the movie and once again, the trailer scenes look better. Although I doubt even the trailer scenes could save this.<br /><br />What I did like were the actors, particularly the ones playing the teenage girl and her would-be boyfriend (Kathryn Newton and Matt Shively.) The child actor playing Robbie is convincingly creepy. Inevitably, they've announced a part 5 and a Latin spin-off. I strongly suggest we all read and heed the reviews before dropping more money into this demonic cash vortex.

B00000J7SS|5.0|I have to admit that initially, I had to get used to such a sharp change and break from the past that this recording represented.  I have to say that so many years, I can listen to this recording.  In fact I enjoy it more now.  I am always amused by those who had problem with the melding of rock and jazz. Baseless accusations of over intellectualizing rock, thus becoming pretensions or conversely pandering to rock audiences and mixing these more pronounced rhythms in with jazz improvisation. Both short sighted views in my opinion as shown by the subsequent generations of musicians.  Yes, it's moody, intense and abstract.  It is also inventive, and funky.  Miles was no stranger to controversy.  There was a fusion of sorts when he attempted both Porgy and Bess and Sketches of Spain.  Not exactly jazz, but beautiful nonetheless.  There was resistance to that.  So be it.  Miles had been slowly become more abstract and more progressive with the classic quintet, which redefined the acoustic group, their instrument and make up.<br /><br />Bitches Brew, for me, is a visionary work with many high points.  Miles' playing is in fine form here.  Wayne Shorter is essential, his playing is downright beautiful throughout.  Spanish Key and Pharoaoh's Dance are two example at how elegantly the two music forms mesh. The other aspect of this recording that is essential is the funk element, subtle as it may be.  Miles's tone is no less diminished or effected by being in a new context. Less fragile,  Throughout the groove is kept, keeping it accessible.  The drumming and percussion is so integrated that it drives without overpowering.<br /><br />The music landscape was changing and Miles changed with it.  This and In A Silent Way were two essential recordings for Miles and for music in general.

Like all Mahjong games I've played, it is sometimes difficult to determine &#34;levels&#34; and which tiles are actually open, but that seems to always be an issue.  My only other (minor) complaint is that I have never been able to figure out the &#34;flower&#34; and &#34;season&#34; tiles and which ones match.  But I just keep trying until I get one.  Some levels are more difficult than others.  You can just play it at your leisure or you can try to get &#34;stars&#34; by completing the puzzles in set lengths of time.
B0086700CM|5.0|If you really want to see what game play on your Kindle is like this is a great game to try out. You run, jump, slide, and move left and right. The graphics are great. You laugh when you mess up. This is one of my top apps. Very addictive.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted a simple, easy calculator on my Kindle Fire HD and since this was free, I gave it a try.  It's nothing fancy, but gets the job done.  I've had no problems with it at all.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Nice graphics. Easy to play. Great to be able to play with your friends. A great game for all ages. I recommend this app.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|I completely suck at this game, but I do really enjoy it.  It is easy to learn and has lots of different options.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This was a really good cover at a great price.  As much as I like my leather case, this offers a hardshell that protects my Fire just that much more.
B0086700CM|5.0|For some reason I thought this game wouldn't appeal to me.  Then I finally downloaded it and I am hooked!  It's just addictive.  I like all the different options, the bonuses, etc.  My only complaint would be that while the initial tutorial is great for getting you started, I find that the upgrades you can &#34;buy&#34; with stars you collect along the run are not often well explained...or explained at all.  Takes some trial and error to figure it out.  This has become my &#34;go to&#34; game when I have a bit of time to kill.  It is easy to get caught up in it.  (I've now downloaded Temple Run 2, but haven't tried it yet).
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Bought the book because I had read reviews of the movie.  GREAT read even with the liberal use of the f word, which usually caused me to stop reading.  I have to see the movie now!
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Bought this for a 4-yr. old granddtr. and she loved it, being able to change costumes that don't fall off like paper dolls used to do.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan has done it again. This book rivals the Percy Jackson series. His greatest strength is making mythology accessible to young adults and others who are interested as well.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|It's hard to believe that such an excellent show with superlative actors and writing exist along with all the silly reality shows were are assaulted with, but that's the truth. As another reviewer said, I was worried that the second season wouldn't live up to the first. But wow, it might even have surpassed it. No spoiler alerts from me, but if you liked the first season, you'll be hooked and begging for more after seeing the second season. This is primo TV.
B009AMALGM|4.0|The series (it is a series now) is not.  Lots of folks like it (or not) and it is easy to get tired of the same approach each time - but still, I like this type of film and have enjoyed them all even - but if you have not seen any of the priors, please check out the 1st and 2nd ones at least - before you jump in and buy this.  Many places already have them low enough that they are almost rental price or they (1 to 3) are now bundled....there are already some very well detailed reviews, so I will just add that I enjoyed 1-2-3 and now, I also enjoy 4.  I felt the green-pixel tracking dots of the game system and what they did with that, was a nice added effect.  So for a person wanting to purchase - I did, feel I got my money's worth.  And as I mentioned I do enjoy this type of film and the series has not bored me yet.  If you already collect and like this series - I feel you will reasonably to fully enjoy this and won't regret buying it.  If you are not already a seasoned collector of it -- then rent or bargian-bin-purchase at least the first 2 before you buy it at current price.
B009X01C64|3.0|This is the first case I purchased and returned as the plastic holder was not molded very well and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 wouldn't snap into place without something breaking first. Returned for an exchange.
B00095NX9G|3.0|I find this to be a great DVD, but it is a bit advanced for where I am at in my practice (I am a casual dancer). It also has a lot of work on your toes and I have some arthritis in my toes, so I have to skip some of the steps. Rachel is a beautiful dancer, with some wild grace! Get this DVD for a great challenge!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This is a fun App to play with when nothing else seems to matter. The physics are very well done not to mention can also be customized for different effects.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is AWESOME . I love it. But maps are to small. And you can't blow up TNT on creative! Good but won't rate five stars till problems are fixed.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|For a Free App this one can sure carry a tune, or ten. It does not actually teach you how to play the piano, however it does let you get a feel for how the song is played with its game-like interface. What is really nice is the fact that there are different levels for those are not a concert piano player and for those who know a thing or two about the difference is between the black and white keys.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minevraft I have it on my xbox sometimes whenever I'm boards I wish I could play minecraft but now I can thanks guys
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I found this game simple, yet challenging at times, which is what a game should be. In the lower levels you get the feel for how the games goes and then it builds with more pipes and a larger grid to work with. Nothing too easy to be bored with and nothing too hard that it makes you want to throw the device against the wall. Great fun for any age.
1616550414|4.0|Well I had this preordered and it was shipped right on time and arrived in two days even though I chose standard shipping. So it was super fast which is perfect because it arrived in time for my partners birthday.<br /><br />The book itself is gorgeous, all green leather and gold lettering. The content is superb, absolutely perfect for the Zelda fanatic. I couldn't be happier with the buy.<br /><br />Word of caution though to the shipping. It is shipped flat in a box with little to no protection. As a result the corners of the book are bent and dinged which was quite the disappointment and the reason I'm knocking one star off. The shipping really needs to be improved.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Some of the books I find are in PDF format and therefore this is the perfect App to have installed from the get go.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Not strong on plot...or acting per say, but an action fans dream! Epic scenes with the Heros of the 80's and 90's.<br />It was hands down the best pound for pound action flick I've ever seen. Perhaps it's because I grew up on the Rocky, Terminator, Die Hard franchise as well as any movie with Van Damme and Norris.<br />Spoiler Alert: there is nothing like seeing Bruce, Arnold, and Sly shooting at bad guys in unison with Chuck bringing up the rear!<br />Awesome!<br />Oh, and by the way...I'm a chick! Can you imagine how much more a dude might love this movie?!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|For those of you who want to live in a paperless society, then this App is for you. Its simple, effective, and in different colors. Best of all it doesn't clutter your screen when you save the notes. Good for taking quick notes.
1609611543|5.0|This is a gift to my spouse. She reports that there is a wealth of information included. We both plan to implement many of the recommendations contained in this volume.
B0086700CM|4.0|The game is simple, straight forward, and easy to learn with great sound and graphics to back it up, which can be only one thing... its very addicting. Something about trying to keep pace through the obstacles whlie keeping your distance from monkeys has a certian allure that makes this game hard to put down. The only downside, if there is one, is that part of the game involes tilting the device so the character can move from side to side. This means that you need to constantly hold the device while playing it and depending on what you are using (Kindle Fire HD 8.9) that can get a little heavy after a while.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|The movie  was ok but i paid for HD quality and got regular viewing. No HD at all but the movie was ok.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Watching this movie on Blu-ray is the only way to see it again. The clarity and the sound are superb. Combine that with the extras on the disc you will have a lot of fun watching this story run away like a freight train. Of course the Digital Copy is there if you must have this movie-to-go.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved it. Very good read. Would reccomend this to all Sparks fans. Great way to spend the afternoon. Thanks again
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This was recommended as one of those must-have Apps for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Turns out they were right. There is no pre-installed file explorer anywhere. This one works very well and is easy to use. Could be a little bit more robust in a couple areas, but still a good app to have right off the bat.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Cant beat Nicholas Sparks for your reading entertainment. I hope a new one is in the works. Have read them all
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I purposely waited to get all the movies at once on Blu-Ray as I figured there would be some worth while material out there as bonus features to add not to mention updating some of the sounds and picture quality for modern technology. The real nice part about this set is having both the original theather version along with the updated versions to choose from. Its like having eight movies instead of four plus all of the bonus features. The holder is very well done. If you like watching any of the Alien series... this is the set to buy.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Finally, I can find stuff on my HD.  I felt in the dark until I installed this app.  I put it on my other Fire
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played Temple Run and it was challenging.  Did not master all compants, but I still use it.  when I saw Temple Run 2, I downloaded it and now it hard to stop playing.  Really enjoy it.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This beats that little power bar at the upper right.  I especially like the time-left estimator.  I know ahead of time when I need to plug it back in.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|After watching the &#34;Golden Globes&#34;, I had to watch this. It is a story that runs the range of personal emotions, with great acting and camera work. The story itself is intriguing, stocking salmon in the Yemen River. Sounds impossible, but is it? Watch and find out, you will love the trip. I have added the DVD to my library under &#34;favorites&#34;.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved it from page one.....very cathartic for me. Brava Mr. Quick! Please write more. I am afraid that I am addicted to your writing!
B007HACDLK|4.0|The reintroduction of characters (don't want to give the story away) keeps the plot moving and deepens the readers' multi-dimensional relationship with Mitch.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|This guy was trying to be Slvester Stallone it was funnier than heck for the first 15 minutes then I felt sorry for the jackass, lousy drivel .stallone wannabe
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Having played the original game this is more fun and adventurous. If anyone had fun with the original Temple Run and Temple Run Brave make sure and add this one to your games, you won't be sorry.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|very unmemorable movie I gave it 3 stars only because there were a couple nice effects shots. I think that the actors these days are terrible they all try to overact or mush it up too much. They pump these lousy movies out like bowel movements . No real originality
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game so much. Graphics improved, New power ups available, and awesome new options. Only downside is sometimes it freezes.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|There were some nice action scenes and all but this was not very memorable the last installment with Heath Ledger much better.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This is one of their classic but lesser known works. The theme of the everyday working man is carried through out. Musically each song compliments the next. Salt of The Earth rounds out the album and is as current to today as it was then. If you missed it the first time around take a look. If you've heard it before it's worth more than a second look.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Using the bag to store 2 cameras, a bit tight but just ok.<br />Should have had more sleeves and built keeping in mind the accessories. Seems to be built well and should last long.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this for my 3 year old grandson to play when he is visiting. He loves it and doesn't want to stop. Sometimes, he will do something and then laugh really loud.....not sure what happened but I love to hear his laughter so this is a BIG LIKE for this one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game.  Can't beat free.  Good graphics and fun to play.  Not too challenging for younger children.  It will keep their attention and they will like picking out and grooming their horse.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena was a well put together book which balanced out action a romance perfectly and is a book everyone could read
B00B2LRK7W|4.0|this album is heavy and intense and pure, unadulterated hatebreed.  but to me it shows a slight step backwards from their last album, which developed some new elements to their sound.  i appreciate when a band sticks to its roots, as hatebreed has always done, but i also expect a band to mature over time.  hatebreed showed elements of real musical growth on the last album, but this album drops all of that and goes right back to the basics.  some fans will like this better, but i was really hoping to see hatebreed grow a bit more, throw in some longer songs, more guitar solos, perhaps some new lyrical themes.  but regardless of that, hatebreed is still relevant and intense and the new album still rocks, i was just hoping for a bit more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has a lot of really good versions of it. Has a lot of characters you can buy and you can upgrade it to a better version once you get this app you will fall in love with it. It is very addicting. I require you to get for FREE! GET IT FOR ME!!!!!!!!!! You will one day be very bored and get this game. From your friend,publisher
1616550414|5.0|Its basically the history of Zelda. An amazing book for an amazing price. I mean it really is beautiful. The cover<br />is a nice vibrant green with  beautiful gold lettering and imagery.<br /><br />Basically tells the history of zelda thru small captions and historical markers from the various games and time lines.<br />Giving you each story and key characters with beautiful art and concept sketches to go along.<br /><br />If your a fan of Zelda you need this book, trust me its awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally addictive, simple, yet challenging.  My 2 yo nephew was entertained as well as my 90 yo grandmother...  it's a great way to waste some time, even without buying the $5 double coin upgrade.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great mind soothing app. It has so many great sounds and is great for sleeping, relaxing and even for a nice intimate evening with your special someone.<br /> Great job! on a sound app. It is the best one I've found.<br /> You can also download even more sounds from there website.<br />  Thanks and keep them coming.
B00881VLCE|4.0|If you like puzzles; you will like this app.  It has a lot of different puzzles to choose from as well as a lot of free puzzles!
0307949486|5.0|I'm not a big reader and found myself totally lost for hours in this book.  Only wish there were more than 3 books in this series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I thought this app/game was pure genius. Great to play when you have nothing better to do, and even if you do have something to do. Thank you Big Duck Games LLC.<br /><br />LOVE IT!
B0061S073A|5.0|I have all of my kid friendly apps accessable thru KP.  I don't have to worry about in-app purchases and because I have it turn off Wi-Fi it helps maintain battery life.  Very easy to use, too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the greatest game... its only been here for a short time and I already have almost all characters and powerups that's how addicted I am I have personally only had the game for a week andvits just awesome
B00992CF6W|5.0|LUV THIS APP EVEN THOUGH I APM A GIRL I CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT. IT IS THE REASON I STAY UP SOOOO SOOO LATE BUT ITS WORTH IT.
B00992CF6W|5.0|There are zombies but no town people that don't make sense I mean why are there zombies but no people otherwise the game is awesome  playing if you think you are a fan then GET this or you man your nobody so get it now!!!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|it is so cute to feed your monsters and I especially love when they are babies they are so cute!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Even though I have not used it very much, I like having it on my Kindle and will use it in the future. I would recommend it to others.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|The Boys continue their great performances, and the writers of this series never seem to fail to find new and interesting twists to put them through.  Anyone who love Supernatural will love Season 7!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love playing these games; I have another version as well. I have recommended it to my friends and family.
B00APUQT7I|1.0|It was time to put this franchise away after the 3rd movie.  This one is stupid and senseless. Even my 9-yr-old was bored with it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|As an avid fan of NCIS, I have to say that each year the show just keeps getting better. If I miss an episode, it's like missing a family reunion!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! I enjoyed reading this book. I was hooked from the very beginning. Loved all the characters. There were some parts that were unbelievable, but overall a great book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The horse responds to your touch and really walks and moves like a real horse.  But it takes to long to get gems and do point. Overall it's a really good game. :)
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is a great book. There are many details in The book that are misportrayed in the movie. For instance,the shoes are silver, not red. Also, there are many details that are left out in the movie. If you read the book, the  movie will never be the same again.
B00AGKHEUI|4.0|With all the reviews on this 3 CD delux edition set, No one mentions the god awful packageing.  Im so glad the label did not make us buy this set and gave us the same Demos.alt mixes as from the 2004 2 disc set.  That being said, why did we get the same remastered verson of the standard album.  It has been 9 years since the 1st reissue, surely there could be some improvements made.  I am sure WB's could've found an addtional B-side to add to the first Disc as well.  The labels expect the fans to keep buying the reissues but don't put any thought into the process.  Record companies wonder why the business is failing so much HMMM?  When you keep screwing the public and reissue over and over and intice us to buy the same product 2 and three times with minimal changes, most are going to chose to buy it once.  Everyone already knows about the reissue, Remastering and the demos and alt. takes.  Added is the second disc of Live\\" cuts from the Rumors tour, why can't WB's find a full disc worth of Live material instead of only 12 Cuts.  \\"Come On WB\\"S\\".....atleast bump it to 15 to 17 and use the full disc capacity.<br /><br />Now on to the packageing.  AHHHHHHHHHH!!!, I bought and had to return 3 times already from Best Buy and once at my local Secon Spin (small Independent Store in CA.), why can't labels get it, those of us that still buy the CD's don't want to have our disc's scartched or have smudge marks and finger prints on a new disc everytime we remove it from the sleeve, even vinyl has a protective papper sleeve.  WB's should've looked at Sonys Legacey Edtions.  Plastic trays make it easier and safer to remove disc's.  I am now having to call WB's and try and get 3 replacement Cd's.  It seems the manufacture slides the discs in before the glue is dry to keep the sleeves and packeging together.  Every disc has smudge marks,scartches and glue or some dry liquid on the surface of the CD's.  So if your one of the ones who still buys discs for booklets, packgeing and better sound than the MP3 download way, then be careful when buying this set.  It takes alot patients to remove the discs and you probaly already have some sort of defect on the surface of the disc before removing it.  One of the stores would not refund my money they said all discs cannot be bad, then they opened all 8 of them and they were all bad.  I am one of those picky people who treat there CD's like glass and willl replace a case if it is cracked, broken or has sticky stuff from price tag or stickers, so if you don't care and just want to hear the music and not even look at the surface, then you will have no problems.  It is and enjoyable set with added bonus material, in which you can keep your older set and gain a second disc of alt. mixes,demos and works in progress.  I wonder if in 5 years we get the 40th Anv. editon with a cassette or 8 track copy with it.  PS I am hoping WB's gets of there A!! and does the same thing for the Doobie Brothers Minute By Minute, I know there are over 35 takes for \\"What a Fool Belives\\".  There has to be alot more tape from those sessions......Rock On.  Just waiting for the labels to quit making CD's, and make us do the download thing Ugh, Mp3 sound like crap, especially for audiophiles.  But since Vinyl is making a comback it might go through another  cycle or two.  Peace, Mike S.r sound than the MP3 download way, then be careful when buying this set.

B008476HBM|5.0|Such a change from all the vulgar books out these days, easy to see why it's a classic. Loved it
B009VB7QQA|4.0|This was a surprisingly good movie. Fun fiction about a beloved figure in history. We watched it twice and found it very enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very wonderful game fun entertaining even my daughter and I like it great job on graphics and making it look real hope to see new places to go To make it even better
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love The Hunger Games book and thought the movie did it justice.  Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic as Katniss.  I highly recommend this DVD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game has a lot of things that could help young rider get ready for taking care of their own horse.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It has nice graphic puzzles which are not too challenging so there is no frustration,lol. Just a nice relaxing time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Im waiting for 0.6.0 to come out its already came out on apple products why not on the kindle fires what about yall
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My kids liked playing the original Temple Run, so this was obviously the next step. My 10-year-old says that it is \\"Epic awesome.\\"
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it but I can't find the training button do you love love love love love love love love love love love love
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I've loved Soundgarden since Superunknown and have listened to them pretty faithfully since then. I liked Cochise ok from Audioslave, but it never rose to the level of Soundgarden's brilliant legacy. Neither does this album. But I'm glad they made it because it has some great parts that ring true. I wanted it to be excellent; after a couple months of listening, I can objectively say it's often great and I hope they use this album as a way forward.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who wishes to learn more about the struggles and heroics that occurred in the skies of 1940s Europe. Franz and Charlie shared an amazing bond.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Gripping from the start, the Grisham yarn has more twists then a pretzel. You won't want to put it down.  A worthy effort from a master of the genre.
B007MG360G|5.0|I like this game by far, ten times more than the others. The way the boxes were outlined is something that should be put in the others too. It's simpler, and even if someone wanted to think themselves, you had the option. Great game overall. c:
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|What a great show. Kevin Bacon is terrific. The suspense keeps you On the edge of your seat. This is a winner! I highly recommend. One note, the gore is minimal, I do not personally recommend having kids under 14 watching.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Very good movie and it is very interesting on how the US finally got Bin laden.  Would be buying it but it comes with an Ultra violet copy and not a true digital copy so that makes it a Redbox rental for me.
6305428352|5.0|When I saw this movie for the first time, I was bowled over.  The movie does a good job of bringing some of history's major events to light.  Following Mr. Holland's career as a teacher helped steer me towards a career in education.
B00479SVBU|5.0|In today's modern world with all the new gadgets, it's hard to keep up.  I still drive an older truck and the radio/cd player is just as old but still works great.  I don't own an MP3 player or other such device.  I do like my music though and burning music to cd's doesn't get it.  For the music I have and plan to acquire, I need larger storage.  I don't want a stack of cd's in my truck and me flipping through like a deck of cards trying to find something I want to listen to.  I've put all the music I want on a USB drive or SD card and insert into the Soundfly and I'm set.<br /><br />It's great that you can set up different files for different music if you want.  It's easy to navigate through the files to find what you want.  The only problem is it's so hard to see the screen.  I can't really position the Transmitter in the power socket good enough to see what's playing or what folder I'm in.  It's better in the dark but, during the day it's almost impossible.  As far as the shuffle function and repeat and normal, well, I don't bother because it never seems to do what I want.  The order of songs you see on your computer screen does not match how it plays them.  There is no &#34;alphabetical order&#34;.  It seems to play them in the order you originally put them on the USB.  Weird.  Maybe it's me.  No matter.  I still love my Soundfly.  I even like the name....&#34;Soundfly&#34;.  Also, even though I have used the remote, I'd rather just use the buttons so the remote isn't necessary.  I'm thinking of buying the Soundfly with the 2&#34; screen and giving mine to some needy sound freak.  There may be better transmitters out there but, I've had mine for two years now and no problem.  It is plastic but if you treat it like plastic you should be OK.  My wife has the model below this without the screen and we've had it for maybe 3 years and no problem.  Now, if my wife can manage not to break it, then it can't be too bad.<br /><br />Overall, I love it and recommend it.  With maybe 35 out of nearly 400 reviews being below 3, well, that says something.  &#34;Get it&#34;.th maybe 35 out of nearly 400 reviews being below 3, well, that says something.  &#34;Get it&#34;.

Most of the tracks are the familiar staples that Andy and Corrine have done over the years but refreshed and redone in a more intimate studio setting.  I enjoy listening the first track most of all and still never get bored with the wonderful SOS staples.  Corrine's voice is ever so impeccable and lovely and Andy's arrangements sans compare.  Keep it up you two.
B003KJF2WE|5.0|We enjoyed watching this movie.  It was well done and Amazon provided excellent quality in the streaming service.  I can't wait for Hulk 2.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Uno is a fun game and it passes the time away you can sit down and play uno for showers and then win its such a fun game
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is definitely worth the watch if you're a fan.<br /><br />Both parts are amazing. Enough to remind you of how good this story is to begin with.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Best game ever the first few times you play it but after a while I can not open.Now my original temple run won't even open.
B005LAII80|4.0|I finally got sick of renting it, so I had to make the purchase.<br /><br />Not incredibly long, but a great action flick. Whether you're a comic nerd or not.<br /><br />Best price I found by far was Amazon.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Not sure how true to life the movie is, but thought the film was well done. It is a shame that Africa seems to be &#34;out of sight and therefore out of mind&#34; to most of America.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|This is definitely worth the watch if you're a fan.<br /><br />Both parts are amazing. Enough to remind you of how good this story is to begin with.
1616550414|5.0|Did not realize I was going to get such a heavy book (Amazon box had a Heavy Object label :D)! The book itself is very well made, hard cover, well bound and quality print. The art work and content are amazing for any Zelda fan and even just people with appreciation for video games. So glad this made it to the US. Makes a great gift!<br /><br />Also, less than $20 for such a hefty volume is a steal.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed playing this. It has a good story. Never a dull moment. I found it easy to navagate and found the hint button helpful. Good creepy fun!
0142403873|5.0|My little grandson is 5 months old, and he LOVES to be read too!!  Of course he tries grabing the pages, but these books here are big and very attentive, where the grabbing isn't so bad!! Love the books!!
B000000WA4|3.0|Basically just 4 songs on here that I like and they're the ones you hear on the radio all the time. That's not very good considering how many songs are on this compilation. I guess I just don't like their writing very much. I bought this cd used and it was in perfect working order so I would use this seller again
0142402753|5.0|My little grandson is 5 months old, and he LOVES to be read too!!  Of course he tries grabing the pages, but these books here are big and very attentive, where the grabbing isn't so bad!! Love the books!!
0767821629|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it and decided to have a copy. If you like sci-fi you've got to see this movie. CD I bought was used but the disc was scratch-free. Would order from this seller again

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is so omg it Is so cool. It is a must have so cool. I love this app you I am sure you will too make sure you get it it is so cool omg. Now get this app!!!
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|The reason I did not give 5 stars to this movie is because it is dark (poor lighting in too many scenes) and not entirely consistent with the Star Trek story.<br /><br />I am a Star Trek fan and Amazon said they would give me $5.99 credit ( they charged me instead) towards watching movies.  So I tried the service and part way during the movie, it stopped.  I had to reboot Roku to finish the movie.<br /><br />I have watched many dozens of movies from Netflix in HD with Roku and never had a problem.  Amazon made a fun movie into a hassle.  My birthday film wasn't as good as it should have been.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is amazing. If u haven't got it, get it. U get to collect money, buy boards and characters. U also get to visit places like net York and rio
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love dragonvale I'm a level25 and the dragons are so cool!I love to use a race track it is so fun to try to use new dragons to buy and to race with!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you love temple run this Is the game for you!!!  run,dash,and hover through Brazil. You can get 5times multiplayer!!! Get it NOW!!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|An absorbing account of a brilliant but twisted mind and the wreckage left in its wake. The husband is a likeable character for whom you can feel sympathy - after a time. The plot keeps you on your toes and helps you to suspend your disbelief. Most enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game rocks. I love how it changes pace and how you can pick and choose which avatars you want to use. The boards are pretty cool too.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Based on the authors credentials I expected something more analytical than the usual &#34;white light&#34; experience of others. I guess we're not supposed to &#34;know&#34;.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|It took several tries to get this app to fully download and sometimes in the middle of the game it would go straight to main menu.  However, it didn't lose my progress so I didn't mind.  The puzzles are somewhat challenging and the objects are well hidden. I would recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game freezes and sometimes shuts off when I am playing it.I have a kindle and this game makes my kindle very slow and makes other things not work at all.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is soooooo fun. So far i played this game over 100 times nd still want more. I currently have the high score out of all the people i play against on facebook but i wont stop till my thumbs fall off :))
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was great.  Can't wait till she writes more books.  This book will have you thinking what your limits are and how far you will go.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game. Keeps your brain active plus as it gets easier you. Just change options alnd make it challenging again. Great game to play while waiting for appointments and sitting in hospitals with loved ones.
B008NR26KY|5.0|Wow! was this ever a good book. I didn't know what to expect when this first came my way through a Goodreads recommendation. I haven't read a lot of \\"self-published\\" fiction and the little I've seen has been, honestly, junk: riddled with grammatical mistakes, full of cliches, etc. But Wool is as good as anything I've ever read. There must be some major publisher out there who would have been interested in taking this on. Anyway, the story: basically, the book is a series of interconnected novellas (novelettes?) that deal with the people living in a silo after some sort of apocalyptic event. The people know where they are and, basically, why--this isn't one of those books where everyone's forgotten and thinks that this is all there is of the world. They live under some very harsh rules, rules designed to keep everyone in their place, discourage individuality and free thought, and keep the peace. Whenever someone does step out of line or has an original thought or even, sometimes, asks to go \\"outside,\\" they are sent to \\"cleaning,\\" which involves putting on a sort of hazmat suit and being pushed outside the airlock, where they are expected to clean off the dirt and grime that periodically collect on the sensors and cameras that the silo uses to see outside. So far, no one has ever failed to clean, even though it is essentially a death sentence, since the air outside is apparently so toxic that these suits fall to pieces within a short time. Howey does such a great job of describing the place, giving us just enough detail to imagine most of it for ourselves. And he's even better with the characters, creating one of the more memorable of science fiction heroines in Juliette, a Mechanical worker who replaces the sheriff recently lost to a cleaning and finds herself at the center of much of the story's intrigue and events. Wool is very highly recommended and one of the best books I've read in a long time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is the best game I have ever played<br />and it is so awesome too<br />you can fight other robots. I won the all of the game
B002BBJ52U|5.0|I could watch this movie again and again.  The characters are all endearing and the content is enlightening and still lighthearted.<br /><br />Also, I rented it from Amazon Prime streaming and had some issues of it locking up once or twice.  It was a bit frustrating, but I never said a word about it.  Turns out I didn't need to!  They noticed on their own and simply gave me a refund!  How cool is that?!  Thank you Amazon!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well this is the best survival game ever but we haven't gotten the new update yet or 0.6.0 but still it is amazing better than survival craft
B007STBUIW|5.0|I'm speechless, this BLU-RAY/DVD set is, without question, one of the best transfers ever. I love everything about JAWS, and the extras are great. Get it!
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This movie reminds me of Napoleon Dynamite in the sense of you have to watch it more than once to get into it. The pace of the movie was slow going til part 2 but if you are Tommy Lee Jones or Robert Duvall fan you won't mind it.
B009EJSQ3G|5.0|This newly remastered version with DVD met all my expectations.<br />Can't wait for more remastered DVD extras in the future.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Yes this is a great app and yes it's awesomely addicting, but whenever you don't update a high paid app on every devise below 2.2 and the kindle fire, most of the users get angry and write bad reviews ,and by not updating this devise, you are unconstructionaly loosening cash. Good advice: stop saving up all your money and update the kindle fire to 0.6.0!!!!
B00540G3G6|5.0|This Blu-Ray is beautiful The transfer is flawless. Loved it all. Can't say enough of this classic and beautiful treasure.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book it's so sweet romance changes two life's forever it's so sweet so if u like mystery and romance then get this book
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game is awesome but it needs more updates where is 0.6.0 :( and why is the world not never ending:(
0307719219|1.0|While quite interesting, those who have traveled to any degree probably find they already know what is in this book.  It is also highly repetitive, to the extreme.  It would be intersting to find out how many times the words \\"Glorious Revolution\\" were used.  By about page 300,I just skimmed through.
B002PE0HCU|5.0|Sometimes its hard to watch movies made a long time ago. Its not always the case that they hold up on the light of more modern movies that handle the same topics. In the case of the Horror genre its particular hard to watch old movies, specially with how the modern horror movies handle them. But watching a movie like the birds from the start to finish, you are able to appreciate what is missing from the modern horror movies, there is no heart at the center, there is no suspense, in the modern horror genre its all about shock. The Birds starts as a romantic comedy,and builds up to a great conclusion. you are introduce to your characters, and certainly there is something wrong in the air and you can feel it. Hitchcock is always driving the narrative, logically and  its certainly manipulating the audience very effectively.<br /><br />PS: this is not a movie to cath on TV, its at its best if watch from the very beginning.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves Minecraft.  He thinks the game concept is really cool and fun to play.  Sometimes he thinks the mobs are scary.  Neat game. Would recommend this app. Worth the price!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun but u need a lot of coins to get stuff trophies r pointless whish u could trade them in for coins if u like Temple Run it is the same kind of game but u r in a different area
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Confusing but still a great game!  I really liked playing the different levels.  The graphics are remarkable and detailed.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys hidden objects.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game glad I tried it. good time passer. I would for sure try it if you have nothing better to do.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies from 2012. It was surprisingly funny! All of the actors in the movie do a great job with their singing parts. I loved the mash ups of songs. I just wish we got to see some more mashups a little earlier on in the movie.<br /><br />Tons of great one liners. Anyone that enjoys comedy and singing should watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.
1452110581|5.0|This is such a silly concept, but so very funny.  It's a great little gift for cat-lovers and when I have given as a gift, I have gotten really positive feedback from my friends.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|This movie was pretty good. But everyone I talked to loved it, I just liked it. I would watch it again, I wouldn't buy it.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Your bop I'm fresh to death and I'm cool like that and your not.I love this game so much and I improve my skills
B004G6009U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a neat spin on the story. I watched it recently again and I realized I missed the last part that came after the credits. That part I could have done without, but seeing as the movie isn't really for 34 year olds...I think I'll give that a pass. I loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is this best action packed game since temple run, this one of my top 5 games on the kindle fire hd !
B005LAIHZY|2.0|I thought this movie was pretty bad. Especailly for a Disney movie. It got such great reviews, but I found I was just bored with it. I think it could have been way better. I laughed once, maybe twice. I like the idea, but it just fell flat, so very flat...
0375847227|5.0|best book ever. i did not know it was 3 books, but it is and they were all an amazing series. very fun.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|It seems to be some kind of rule in life, books are always better then the movie. Especially the movie Sleeping with the Enemy...read the book, much, much better. Anyway...this movie was good, I liked it and I can't wait to see the next one. But, it just didn't have the flair that the book did. There seemed to be something missing. But I thought all the actors were excellent and I will buy this movie for sure. But nothing is ever as good as the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing read. It was very heart touching and inspiring. Really makes you appreciate the small things in life, and the courage to face anything.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|I really liked this movie, and I didn't expect to. I liked it because it was touching and different. I think it's easy to keep making the same fairy tale movie about princesses and what not, but this was original. I plan on buying it to show my daughter when she is old enough.
1932100660|5.0|I loved it except it might get boring from repetition. Also, sometimes it went over my head with all of the detailed science experiments but I appreciated it because it made me trust his ideas.
B0085Z3B2Q|2.0|This movie was boring. BOR-RING! Okay, parts were okay. Parts. But for the most part....BORING. The only thing I can say is I didn't fall asleep. It was very colorful, also. HA!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is a very fun game. Its very entertaining. The horse is amazing and I think I take pretty good care of it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like how you can throw acorns. It is a good pace and not too frustrating. It is fun for kids &amp; adults.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Its simple. If you are a batman fan, you must watch this movie. It is clearly the best Batman to date. AMAZING!!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Not my favorite Depp/Burton<br />The trailer showed the whole highlights of the movie so there were few clever surprises. I did enjoy the special effects and makeup/costuming and the overall look. The doctor was interesting.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|Sad but not so sad that u can't read it I enjoyed her life story told in retrospect. I just wish it had one more chapter at the end.
0785814531|5.0|i bought this book as a gift and it arrived in excellent condition and on time. I paid a very reasonable price for such a great book, and i was very satisfied with my order :) two thumbs WAY up!!!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Gave 5 stars cause it has been the best game yet that I have downloaded.I have killed my battery a few times playing this because I can't stop. Always just 1 more time lol. The only thing I didn't like is it did not come with instructions but not too hard to figure out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am from New York city and the subway is the same.great way to kill time.love the surfer broad .
B0002KZAKS|4.0|Now that I've tried both of these mics, I thought I'd share my observations. The XM8500 and the XM1800S 3-pack are some of the best deals in microphones out there.  But how do they perform?<br /><br />I'm not using them for singing but for recording speaking. I want a dynamic because condensers pick up too much ambient noise.<br /><br />I want a mic that has good noise rejection, sounds \\"smooth\\" compared to tinny computer mics and basically performs like a Heil PR-40 without the price. The PR-40 has great noise rejection, at ~40 dB.  The gearheads like them because of that and that they are a bit of a prestige item. I currently have no need for such things. All this is said to set the tone that my evaluation isn't going to be 4 or 5 stars just because it sounds approximately like my voice.<br /><br />XM8500 and 1800s differences:<br /><br />* The 1800s appears physically larger. I may be mistaken but I do believe this to be true.<br />* The XM8500 does not have an on/off switch.<br />* The XM8500 supposedly is built to not be as noisy due to handling.<br />* The XM8500 definitely does have two stage windscreen - one built into the metal screen and one on the actual microphone element. The 1800s does have an internal windscreen but not on the element. This makes external windscreens relatively unecessary on the 8500.<br />* The 8500 is a true cardioid pattern - the 1800s is a \\"supercardioid\\", meaning it does have some rear pickup - this is bad if you have echo in your room. I didn't find this to be a huge issue in practice.<br />* I can't find any actual polar patterns online for the 8500 but the 1800 is actually pretty decent despite the rear pickup.<br /><br />All those differences aside, I was able to get very nice, smooth sounds out of both. I do think the 8500 is a bit more refined and professional in sound and has an immediate good sound on plugin without having to tweak much.<br /><br />They're both incredible values. I wanted to try out the Pyle 58 clone butthe lack of really detailed specs online make me leery of buying sight unseen.<br /><br />Does the 8500 have the noise rejection of a PR-40? No. Does it sound as good as a PR-40? Very close, at least for speaking. How many 8500s can you buy for the price of one PR-40? About 15. There you have it.
B004I744AS|5.0|for me is a great tool to learn everyday  in a fun way  is the most complete dictionary i have found.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Truly a great read. Loved the story - couldn't put book down. Highly recommend!! Truly entertaining from beginning to end!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|She plays it all the time. We only wish it was easier to get gems. It . Is a fun game
B0085KGHI6|5.0|what can i say about the greatest rock n roll band in the world! with another great muddy waters in chicago,<br />must see for all stones fan and blues fan, just a rare peice of rock n roll history.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|This film offers thought provoking glimpses into life and situations where a resolution requires a change of heart and an act of self sacrifice.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is the best app one can buy for that kind of money with no real flaws, but there seems to be an issue with the updating, while the other devices obtained 0.6.0 this one is still on 0.5.0
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is totally worth the price you pay, Free! It has even taught me some stuff. It is very easy to level up. I recommend the game to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I m not a gamer. But this only game i playing every weekend. I like earn coins for new characters.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|This series needs to die and never return. Plot was thin. And these \\"zombies\\" dont compare to what i can see on Walking Dead.
B0002BO05S|5.0|This telling of the life of Jesus Christ of Nazareth during His time on Earth about 2,000 years ago works because of the excellent cast: Max Von Sydow as a convincing Messiah, Charlton Heston as a fiery John the Baptist, Dorothy McGuire as the long suffering Mary,Claude Rains, Telly Savalas and Jose Ferrer as evil rulers, David McCallum as treacherous Judas, Martin Landau as an envious high priest, and Donald Pleasance as the devil in the flesh.<br />Filmed mostly in the deserts of the Southwest U.S., the backgrounds appear realistic. The original clocked in at over 4 hours. Subsequent versions are a little over 3 hours. Its greatest value is adherence to the Gospels.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|Too many items that needed to be downloaded after the game itself was downloaded.  Slowed down my device. Too much!!!
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|Touch screen was off, and second level was too hard for me. Cute idea, though, just not worth it. Don't waste your time and gt a better game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's good fun and realistic, also it's addictive and good to play if you are bored! I recommend it to any people contemplating on downloading it, plus its free, you have nothing to lose!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love playing this game and feel like it has no flaws besides ads - but that's just what u get when its free..... totally worth it, though!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|SUBWAY Surfers is very cool. We also love the game. I have never seen this game before and I like it a lot because it has exciting parts in it. We also like it because I think it would be cool to run on train tracks and trains and the game brings it to life. Well I hope you like what I said.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />  Camille,and,HayleeBug:) :) :) :) :)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I will download it but it wont load after I play it 4 a while. other wise it is awsome
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a fun game, you get to help other animals in the Continental drift, when they lost their homes. Play as Manny, Sid, Diego, and create a huge village. Customize with many things like a movie theater,volcanoes and mote, This is a true fun game I would recommend you to play, and you don't have to be a certain age! Play at any age or stage of life. HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!:)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Whoa that was some heavy subject matter!! However a wonderful read, it brought some awareness to a subject that I'm not familiar with. It had every emotion you could ever feel while reading this story too. Colleen Hoover you are a very talented writer!!! Brilliant!!! Please don't ever stop sharing your stories :)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is A EXCELLENT book I absolutely loved the book and the excellent cliffhanger ending! I recommend this book to 10 or older though, because they're some tensions in the book that usually usually only older kids would understand,such as teenage relationships. But overall this is the best book I've read in a very,extremely long time, and believe me, I've read a lot of books in my day.
B004FN16DS|5.0|This book is a Myth Buster!<br />Many of the things we hear from friends, family, politicians and analysts in the media are wrong!<br />It's a must read!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|EXCELLENT with a dash of spooky! U can't top thus game but I guess they are with the second (can't wait!!)
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie was so funny and action packed and it touched my heart! It is an amazing movie. Only bad thing is it uses some pretty bad words, but hey that is what makes it funny! I recommend everyones buys it or rents it! Such a good friday night movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. If you get this game I asher u that u will have a great time playing with it. Love this game because it's a challenge and you have to find a way to not hit the trains and not get caught by the police and the dog. If you get it I hope u enjoy it!!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read this in two sittings.  I was hooked from the first chapter. Cannot wait to see the movie when it is released!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is one of the best games I have played<br />I would give it about 5 stars but there is one flaw<br />We be you do something  it won't do it any more
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a cool game but sometimes it gets stuck and you smack a train. It has nice graphics. It's simple but addictive.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I love this CD it works great. The only thing that i didn't like was that the case was cracked (CD was fine) when it reached my house but that is the people shipping it fault. Over all very satisfied
0783225725|5.0|Another of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies.  Good performances and well shot.  Clint's character was neither good nor bad.  He appeared as a living being even though the movie hinted he was a ghost back to avenge his own death at the hands of cowards.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|People had told me that this book was good, but I didn't realize it was \\" stay up till 4:00 am reading\\" good. Highly recommend!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The bottom line; I like to sleep with soft music in the background. My wife is a light sleeper and can't.  She calls anything coming from the phone noose and it disturbs her sleep....<br /><br />NOT THIS APP!!!<br /><br />Seamless sound, easy to understand. No unnecessary junk. Puts you asleep FAST. Drowns ambient sound. My favorite theme is water. Option to view beautiful picture of sound source or digital clock.<br /><br />Tried several white noise apps. Deleted them all. This ones a keeper.<br /><br />It's morning and time to wake, but my wife is still sleeping like a baby to this app!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always Grisham writes a face paced action novel. A definite page turner, and a good read. Love his books
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|He was the lead singer of the Animals,one of the key founders/presenters of War and has continued to have a prolific and musically fruitful solo career as well. Between the more commercially inclined Mick Jagger to the almost blues purism of John Mayall and Paul Butterfield Eric Burden has always been that important missing link in the British blues/rock scene of the 60's that has knocked down any gaps that have existed between blues,rock and soul music. That's left his sound open to a number of different stylistic changes over the years. Well now it's 2012 and half a century has passed since Eric first made his musical debut as a member of the Animals. He has watched generations of people,time and music come and go. And in the case of music,often come around again. Somehow though the music he based his entire career on,R&B,has continued to thrive. And in terms of Eric himself thrive it does.<br /><br />  The album opens with two spirited blues rockers in \\"Water\\" and \\"Memorial Day\\",the latter reflecting strongly on the relationship between being against a war but supporting warriors who fight them. \\"Old Habits Die Hard\\" and \\"In The Ground\\" deal with the same rocking blues flavor on the topics of hard living and regret. On \\"Devil And Jesus\\" he uses the medium of hardcore southern soul to explore that mixture of the spiritual darkness and the light at the heart of all blues based music-including soul. \\"27 Forever\\" has a similar soul flavor and deals with that age when so many rock legends pass away and become shooting stars. \\"Wait\\" blends a clean,percussive bossa soul type flavor-a wonderful paean to romantic longing. On \\"River Is Rising\\"? Well he's talking the blues back to Congo Square with the infectious percussion of the Caribbean adding the main musical might. One of my personal favorites here.<br /><br />  Of course there's also \\"Bo Diddley Special\\",my favorite here as Eric describes seeing the R&B instrumental innovator live in concert,right down to his description of the shape of Bo's guitar! Between two interpretations,the soulful Marc Cohn \\"Medicine Man\\" and the closing rocked up blues of Muddy Waters \\"Before You Accuse Me\\",there's the brilliant jazzy blues of \\"Invitation To The White House\\",in which Burden once again muses on a dream he had where he addresses the US president (Barack Obama likely) and gives him requested advice on how to make America better. If the blues is at it's root a confessional form Eric Burden has,especially by this time,an understanding of it nearing perhaps the level where people such as Muddy Waters,John Lee Hooker and Howlin Wolf had. And all of them lived that life that was their music. Eric for his part has lived through much. And the conversational and expressive way he emotes his powerful voice actually makes this one of the few records where I can say it sounds as if the artists is having a personal chat with me. As for the content of this \\"record chat\\" to extend the metaphor?

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is the best movie ever made. The CD works perfect, no scratches. It is under 5 bucks. That is less than walmart. It is sweet, it is awesome, it is like the best movie ever made.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A good read and a real page turner. A nice escape from reality but the twist at the end was unexpected and unnecessary.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Who would think that the trials and tribulations of the end, or at least a significant change, of the British aristocracy would have any relevance in 21st century America. However, it does! What are our responsibilities for local employment, employer-employee relations, and labor relations? What is the impact of technology on job destruction and job creation?<br /><br />That, and it is just cool to see recent history that seems so far away: women's suffrage, race relations, class mobility, and so on.
034580404X|3.0|I wanted to like this book/series, especially since I usually listen to books on CD from the library and I had actually invested money in these paperbacks! I was told this wasn't the sort of book to listen to on CD because you might have an accident! LOL! I have not read the other two yet, but I have to agree with those who say the book is poorly written. The characters are flat; dialog is hokey; it's annoyingly repetitive. I find it hard to feel sympathy for the characters. Christian Grey is only appealing because Ana says so. It's that old adage--show, don't tell. I don't find him appealing, as compared to, for instance, Jamie in the Outlander novels. Anastasia is stupid. It's not believable that she would go from a total innocent who--at age 21, has not gotten past first base--to get an \\"A\\" on a pleasing her man the first time, and lose all her inhibitions. A good writer can make anything seem believable, but this is not good writing. Probably the only reason it's a best-seller is because it's risque and people are curious (as I was).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and I love the Rio one.It was pretty hard to complete 5 daily challenges but I did it'

0547848412|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is a superbly written, fast-paced account of a boy lost at sea after a shipwreck. The first 100 pages seemed a bit slow compared to the rest - the ship doesn't sink until page 97/chapter 17 - but the writing is so good - and funny at times - that I didn't mind in the least. Two thirds of the book deal with Pi's odyssey across the Pacific, adrift in a boat with a tiger, and at that point it was impossible to put it down. The descriptions of what it must feel like to be in such a situation - the different concept of time, the heat, the cold, hunger, thirst - and an unimaginable solitude - are incredible. Parts of it reminded my of Laura Hillenbrand's \\"Unbroken\\". The encounter with the French castaway was somewhere between surreal and hilarious and in the end, horrific. Indeed, there are many parts in this story that are hard to stomach (no pun intended).<br /><br />In regards to how credible the story is - if you are looking for a \\"based on a true events\\" kind of survival story - this is not it. A tiger and a boy surviving in a boat in the middle of the ocean for over 200 days - questionable, maybe, but at the same time, presented in a way that makes it all sound plausible. Just enjoy it for what it is - a great, fantastic story!<br /><br />The twist comes at the end - which I absolutely loved, as brutal as it is. Pi comes up with a different version of what happened, to please the investigators who just cannot believe the tiger story. The second account is quite shocking and brutal, more so than the original version, even though more rational. Unlike some readers who feel that they are left to choose between the two versions, I see how they could both be valid. This is a book that I am going to read again, with the second version in mind, to look for things that tie the two together. I love endings that keep the reader engaged long after he/she has finished the book. I felt the same after reading \\"Edgar Sawtelle\\".<br /><br />I have not seen the movie yet, but am looking forward to it. The imagery looks stunning. I was wondering why Gerard Depardieu plays the cook aboard the ill-fated ship - what surely must be a very small role. The answer to this question didn't come until the very end of the book., but am looking forward to it. The imagery looks stunning.

B004VSTP4Y|5.0|It's crazy thinking that one day I was looking for a random book and came up with this wonderful series. I can't even explain how great this series is. All I got is that you should read these books!!!!!!!!
B00993FEUK|4.0|With zombies all the rage now, seemingly passing up vampires as the go to monster, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that we get an animated version.  Rated PG, this nice film from the folks who brought us \\"Caroline\\" a few years ago is edgy enough for older kids and provides enough artistic skill to keep adults interested.<br /><br />Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11 year old boy who can see and hear dead people and animals...well, not flies.  He's a bit of an oddball at school having to deal with the various ghosts that still lurk around his small town.  The town itself is noted for having witches in its history, including one who still brings her wrath on occasion.  Norman's uncle (John Goodman) tells Norman that is up to him to stop the witch's harassment.<br /><br />With a book of fairy tales in hand Norman sets out to find the witch's grave.  Instead he unearths a gaggle of zombies who he finds out, had a direct influence on the mean witch's current behavior.  \\"Paranorman\\" has a moralistic theme of course, but it doesn't hit you right in the face.<br /><br />The final act really amps up the excellent stop-action visuals and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.  Speaking of soundtrack; one of the things missing from an otherwise superb film is  good music, something usually a staple for animated films.  The humor is more situational than dialog driven.  A few more over-the-kids-head topical comments would have added something for the adults.  Still, this is a worthwhile watch that should entertain the whole family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most addicting game I have played since I got a kindle fire I love the speeds and I love the feature.
B008LSAP30|5.0|Although I've seen this classic Universal film dozens of times starting at about age 10, this is my first look at the excellent Blu ray transfer available as a stand-alone film or part of the \\"Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection.\\"<br /><br />The well-known tale stars Bela Lugosi in his most recognizable role.  The Hungarian actor also played the character in the stage production from which much is adapted for this early talking picture.  Some will snicker at the mannerisms and heightened theatrics more common in the theater.  Even as a great admirer of the movie, I chuckle when I see a couple armadillos scurrying across Dracula's Transylvanian castle.<br /><br />Lugosi, still struggling with English accentuates his dialog not only with an unusual cadence, enunciating each syllable but seemingly each letter.  But Bela was a charmer, especially of the ladies which transformed the Count from the Dracula in Bram Stoker's novel and the first production on film, \\"Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror\\" (1922).  In F. W. Murnau's film, the Count (Orlok) was ugly, sinister and more in tune with what Stoker had in mind.<br /><br />One of the things that always bothered me about the film was the lack of a musical score.  The story has extended moments of silence, except for noise coming from old tape or DVD transfers.  The cleaned up version here, eliminates almost all of the surface noise, and makes the silence even more...well silent.  I much prefer the added Philip Glass score performed by The Kronos Quartet.  I was fortunate to see Glass perform this live accompanying the film a few years ago in Dallas.<br /><br />This exquisite 1080p transfer maintains the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio and includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 (mono) option.  It is the way to go.  Extras include some interesting short documentaries including one introduced and narrated by producer Carl Laemmle's niece who had a small role in the film which included the first words spoken.  The package also includes a Spanish language version which was filmed using the same sets at the time, a couple commentary tracks, trailers and more.  If you are a fan, you'll want this Blu ray.<br /><br />\\"Dracula\\" (Spanish language version):  When Tod Browning's game-changing Dracula was being filmed in Hollywood, a Spanish language version was being filmed at night using the same sets and a slightly altered script.  In some ways, this is actually a better movie.  Unfortunately in some ways it is not.<br /><br />The first noticeable element is that the film runs nearly 30 minutes longer.  Much of this actually provides some context and continuity especially during the voyage of Dracula from Transylvania to England.  Some of the length is also just laborious dialog.  There are two big improvements over the English language version.  First, the creepy atmosphere lingers throughout the movie, rather than just on those early scenes in Drac's castle.  For example, when Dracula rises from his daytime slumber, wisps of smoke exude from his coffin before he is seen.<br /><br />Secondly and most importantly, the leading lady, Lupita Tovar is much sexier and a better actress than Helen Chandler.  Now Eva (rather than Mina) has a clear attraction for the Count.  Her clothing reveals a bit of d&eacute;colletage rather than Chandlers buttoned up look.  Here Lucia is played by beautiful Carmen Guerrero although her role is scaled back.  Like Eva, Lucia is taken with Drac's charms.<br /><br />To offset these improvements however are two more issues.  First and foremost, Carlos Villarias' Dracula is, well...terrible.  His over-acting is often laughable to say the least.  Bela Lugosi certainly is much better and inhabited the role.  I would also point out that in this Spanish version, Renfield takes on a much bigger role and like Villarias, Pablo Alvarez Rubio is no match for his counterpart, Dwight Frye in the English-language version.  All in all, this is an interesting comparo to the better known Dracula and is all the better with this Blu ray update included on the same disc.ula and is all the better with this Blu ray update included on the same disc.

0060254920|1.0|This is another book on my top list of overrated \\"classic\\" books that need to go somewhere and die.  I'm in my 30's, and fortunately did not have this book inflicted upon me as a child.  I have no clue why this book is popular, other than people who had nothing better to read when they were children remembering this book fondly and passing it on.  There are hundreds of fabulous children's books in print today, and I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this book.  It has no plot, and Max is an unlikeable brat.  I don't get what we're supposed to take away from this book, except that Max's mother still loved him even though he was insufferable.  Fortunately, my children don't like this book either.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is such an extravagant, ammusing, great, fun game. I play this game all the freaking time. I think its good everyone should download it and play it! No doubt it's a 5-star (:
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game, quite fun and cool!I didn't give it 5 stars, because you have to pay to get more items quickly. But It's still worth it! Money or not!
B001JFZ118|5.0|The DVD was in great shape and played well,  extras are a plus. As the tagline for the Movie says, &#34;There can be only one&#34; forget the sequels.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a nice, refreshing series this is. The characters are very well cast and the storylines keep up one's interest. I highly recommend all three seasons. In fact, I've gotten several of my friends hooked on this and I have not heard one negative comment from anyone about Downton Abbey.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|it was a page turner and it kept reading all night.  the story is timely and very well done. thanks!

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I love the challenge of the game but I hate it too because I can't get past level 21 even though I have gone online and looked for the solution. I have just been unable to do it. So now I'm frustrated. I guess I need to be 10 years old because the kids can do it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am a big fan of the temple run series of apps. They r fun and challenging. I like the 2nd one because of the minecart and the zipline. However temple run two has a few glitches and can be slow and not respond to ur swipes. But all in all it is one of the best games I have ever played!

B0076DCT2G|4.0|To my way of thinking this was not the best of DeMille, but I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about Yemen and the problems that exist there. In typical DeMille fashion, the research on the area was superb and the sarcatic quips from John Corey very funny.  It took a while for the plot to take off and for me the bad guys were a little unbelievable.  However, it's worth a read - especially for the background on Yemen.

1616960922|5.0|Wan ShaiLu is a Forger. By carefully crafting and using soulstamps, she can in some sense alter the history of an object: fixing a timeworn table by rewriting its history so that it was properly maintained, for example. But the Rose Empire considers Forgery a great evil, and she sits in prison awaiting her fate for having been caught in a theft involving forgery. Fortunately for her, the emperor Ashravan has been desperately injured in an attempted assassination. And the only way he can be healed is for Shai to Forge not an object, but an emperor's soul, well enough to fool an entire nation -- before the emperor's enemies discover the extent of his injuries.<br /><br />\\"I think it's my best piece of short fiction to date, and stands as one of the best complete works I've done of any length. It reads more like a short novel than it does a long short story, and does a lot of what I do in my longer fiction--it has a great magic system and cool characters.\\" -Brandon Sanderson<br /><br />At least based on his works that I've read, Sanderson's right: this is definitely his best short fiction yet. [[ASIN:B005SFRJ6K Infinity Blade: Awakening]] suffered somewhat from issues of pacing (not to mention that the underlying story wasn't fully Sanderson's to tell). [[ASIN:B009KEZ6F6 Legion]] significantly improved upon this, but it told more story in less time than it should have; it felt a little like a long story abbreviated in a short story format. This book truly gets it right: neither is it rushed nor is it slow, and neither is it cramped nor is it drawn-out. It has exactly the right feel for a novella: not too much, not too little.<br /><br />And yet, as Sanderson says, it still does what his stories do best: tell a story based around a systematic form of magic, given through interesting characters. The book takes place in Sel, the world of Sanderson's debut novel [[ASIN:B003G93YLY Elantris]], and there are parallels between portions of this story and that one. (And -- mini-spoiler -- most of Sanderson's works take place in sibling worlds within a universe known as the Cosmere, although this is not relevant to this particular story.) But it's not necessary to read either book before the other: if memory serves, the allusions between them are little more than some similarity of concepts and the nations mentioned in both.<br /><br />Sanderson's novels are where he works best, but he's getting increasingly good at shorter forms as well. If you've only read his novels, this is a good place to start reading his shorter works.spoiler -- most of Sanderson's works take place in sibling worlds within a universe known as the Cosmere, although this is not relevant to this particular story.)

B005LAII8A|1.0|With Bruce Willis you expect some blood, fighting, and profanity in movies. This was nothing as clean as the commercials for the movie. Bruce Willis and others were frequently taking the Lord's name in vain.  There were murders with plenty of blood done by different people - even by a young child - without any sense of remorse or loss.<br /><br />The only really good parts were<br />1) changes in the memory of the older version of the character (played by Willis) getting stronger and weaker as the younger version of the character did normal actions or actions he did not do the first time.<br />2) how the movie ended.

B007PT1PEY|5.0|Enjoy the length of the stories.  I can read for a few hours, put my Kindle down and pick it up again when I have the time.  Although 'old' stories, they are timeless - so well-written, I can 'see' the landscapes, characters, etc.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is fast paced and fun just like the original. The graphics are better and there are a few new obstacles. The game (especially in the gem mine) is harder but still lots of fun. I would recommend it to all Temple Run fans.

B004N6369Y|4.0|Mrs. Steel will always allow you to be a guest in her books. Love, romance, drama, and resolution, can always be found to the ending of her stories. I would recommend this book to anyone who has never been a fan. Then, read Family Ties, Happy Birthday, Friends Forever, Big Girl, n Sisters in that order. Happy Reading and Welcome to the Steel Club.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|What can I say, I didn't rent this for the story as it is mediocre at best.  I wanted to see all of the beautiful men, especially Channing Tatum and is sexy dance moves and Matt Bomer, one of my all time favorite gay actors, just behind Ian McKellen and Ellen Degeneres  :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it's a really cool game to me because I play this game a lot of my day<br />And to make sure I love this game.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|If you like UNO, you will like the digital version too.  I love playing this when I have some time to burn at the airport or during flight or if I'm waiting for a table at the local restaurant.  It's so inexpensive too.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Still reading!  Takes a few chapters, but WOW!  I am sure I will be purchase the next two squels too!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What a story. When you find yourself rooting for a character and becoming emotionally invested in a story, the author has done his job. Well done Mr. King
B006YC74E8|2.0|After I purchased it I realized it was not what I needed so I never even used it. I thought it would help with the camera but it didn't.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Fake counterfeit case.. Box looks legit, but case inside was made of flimsy, cheap, thin plastic. Case too thin to fit iPhone 4. Paper tech support card inside box had wrong phone number for LifeProof tech support.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It fits well and serves the purpose. I have used this case for about a month and have had not problems.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free, and Flow Free Bridges, is one of the best games ever.  For hours of mind-perplexing fun, I would definitely get this game. You may think it is easy at first, but don't be fooled. It is great for all ages, and I certainly recommend it!

B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Loved it great book will read again sometime great book for kids of all ages nothing like the movie better
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|It is a classic and yet it is not so known anymore. It is the kind of  book you definitely want on your shelf so you can read again some day. Viktor Frankl's analysis of his terrible experience makes you change see life and its meaning in a totally different way. I strongly recommend to everyone!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I've been saving up coins to get Scarlet Fox,and every time I got any coins it would delete them.Terrible game don't get it.(I just added the star so.I could post this review).
B007CI81IQ|5.0|I loved this book; a very inspiring research showing how important a scientific approach is, even in the development field. It will break all the clichés you had so far about development!
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game isn't bad,but it's not as good as it could be, ever heard of survivalcraft?It's much better. You should try it out,and it's not one of those games that are like minecraft and really stupid.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I wasn't quite prepared for how gory this book is. I read it in a few days, hardly able to put it down. I've been reading Crichton's work since 1995, and I truly felt like this was his book. From the constant use of characters' full names every time they're referred to, to awkwardly worded sentences, this was classic Crichton. I love his stories, but not always HOW he told them.<br /><br />I loved the facts sprinkled throughout the book; they made the read all the more disturbing. I wasn't expecting so many deaths. There are quite a few surprises as well, though I won't give them away. I had fun with the book and may re-read it in the future, like I have many of Crichton's works. Too bad we can't expect any more from him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very interesting and suspenseful. Has many people on the edge of their seat. Love this book gonna read the second one,Catching fire
0316069434|4.0|It's been a little wait since the prior full-length Harry Bosch story, an excellent novel (\\"The Drop\\") featuring Harry paired with new partner David Chu (an internet and database research specialist). Since then, a series of short-story trilogies released for ebook devices failed to satisfy; so we anxiously engaged with \\"Black Box\\", wherein Harry is again working cold cases, often his specialty, but under the direction of an obnoxious supervisor named O'Toole. Bosch is hard at work on a 20-year-old case involving the death of a Danish journalist that happened to be discovered during the race riots in LA following the Rodney King trial. Harry's dogged pursuit of a possible murder weapon, a possible tie to events in Desert Storm, and other miniscule clues made for a truly suspenseful plot and a terrifically entertaining outing. His supervisor turning him in to Internal Affairs for supposedly abusing an out of town trip, only added to the fun. Indeed, \\"Box\\" (the title having to do with cop slang) reminded us of the early Bosch novels that so attracted us to author Connelly; and we doubt any reader, let alone his fans, will find any fault with this his latest crime-solving thriller.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is the 20 horses game I have played and it is the best<br />I would git the app<br />Just wish u could git gems easier
B0026OR1UK|5.0|This book takes a look at how talent is developed, breaks away from the expected ideas and supports the thesis with observation, antecdotes and research.  Learning about motivation is useful to me personally, but I am even more excited to apply it to the young people I mentor.  It is well written and easy to read.  Read it for yourself, your children and/or your students.  Enjoy!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|This is a nice game,is there any other chapters to this game?Because i would like to go futher with this game.. Thx for creating this game... Big mama
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its really good! If your an animal lover (especially a horse lover)  this is your type of game. the app is about basically caring for a horse. You can enter competitions, feed it and care for it like you would do in any animal game. This game is not hard to play and is pretty simple.Try out this free app and see what you think about it. Remember, the app is free. so why not try it?
B005VDEFCA|5.0|That is right this is a novel about the history of philosophy. It was written by Norwegian professor Jostein Gaarder. Gaarder Now writes other novels and has a large following. I personally found it fun to read and intriguing.<br /><br />Some readers may think the ending is a little strange however it fits the story perfectly. This novel is used as an introduction point to philosophy. So it would not be appropriate for those that already have a background in philosophy to dismiss this as sophomoric. Everyone has to start somewhere. If you are already a philosopher then it is still an interesting novel with an interesting twist.<br /><br />Receiving a mysterious letter in the mail, Sophie Amundson is about to embark on a mysterious journey that is mosty correspondents and may become mutch more. We get to join her on her discoveries.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001R88C6I The Thirteenth Floor [Blu-ray]]]

1423140605|4.0|**Thank you to Disney-Hyperion for providing me with a finished copy in exchange for a honest review**<br /><br />  The hardest reviews are for me to write are for the books that I really enjoyed reading. In my opinion it's easy to nitpick and criticize aspects of a book. The Mark Of Athena is book #3 in the Heroes Of Olympus series and I can't get enough Rick Riordan. I was a bit worried going into this book because it feels like so long ago that I devoured Son Of Neptune. Riordan immediately drew me in the first chapter and my attention didn't waver much at all. It's really hard for me to concentrate on reading one book at a time when a book is as lengthy as the Mark of Athena is.<br /><br />  Nearly 8 years ago Rick Riordan published The Lightning Thief and yet his recent books still have as much momentum as his older books. In 8 years Riordan's writing style is still roughly the same as is the humor and devotion he puts into the creation of his characters. I'll be honest as much as I love The Heroes Of Olympus, I am a bigger fan of the original Percy Jackson series.<br /><br />  Mark Of Athena has so much going on with all of it's many subplots. Annabeth was given by her mother (Athena) a mission to find The Mark Of Athena in Rome. Of course getting to Rome is easier said than done and many obstacles pop up to distract our heroes and heroines.<br /><br />  One of the major differences between The Mark Of Athena and the original Percy Jackson series is the alternating perspectives. The alternating perspective is definitely an effective and interesting tool that really worked well in Mark of Athena. Each of the different perspectives were very distinct in MoA and unique unlike in alot of novels where the perspectives all seem to sound exactly the same. Of all the characters we got to hear from, my favorite was of course Annabeth. I really missed Annabeth's awesome personality and resourcefulness.<br /><br />  The plot in Mark of Athena is quite remarkable because Riordan manages to mesh so many Greek mythical characters in just so few pages. My favorite encounter with a mythical character in this book I have got to say is Leo's encounter with Narcissus. The whole encounter with Narcissus was very unexpected but still very fitting. Team Leo all the way! (If you read MoA, you totally get what I'm talking about!). That ending and cliffhanger was excruciating yet still incredibly awesome. I really wish I could have read The House Of Hades immediately after MoA because that cliffhanger was that spectacular.<br /><br />  The romance in MoA is definitely secondary to the action and adventure but it's still important nevertheless. When Percy and Annabeth had their little reunion, I am not gonna I lie my smile was probably so big that they saw it in Russia. The interactions between Percy and Annabeth were really sweet and touching. The added love triangle wasn't as interesting as Percy and Annabeth's relationship but it still was a well executed concept.<br /><br />  I really enjoyed reading Mark Of Athena and I'm so excited for House of Hades. I really hope that we see more of Chiron, Grover, and Nico because I felt like they were lacking in MoA. The action and adventure in MoA is nothing short of perfect. As always the modernization of classical Greek myths was simply genius and was one of my favorite parts of MoA. To all my friends who haven't read any of Rick Riordan's books, what are you waiting for? If you haven't read any of Rick Riordan's books, you're really missing out!Riordan manages to mesh so many Greek mythical characters in just so few pages.

B00A8KJK7G|1.0|If you buy your dvd's for ripping so you can view them whenever you want on any device you want, this one contains a new security called cinavia that stops the sound after about 20 minutes of playing.  Just sucks...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very entertaining, find myself playing every chance I get. Too many missions  that are hard to complete without paying for them to get through.

B00127RAJY|3.0|Something I hate doing anyway,  this  really isn't an easy exercise video for the novice person.  which I am thrfore I tried it and used it the first 3 days not completing it.  I think it would be good for the more energetic.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was looking for romantic fiction that would be a compelling & easy read - and found it!  Innocent & sweet love story but full of passion without being smutty.  Appropriate for young adult and older.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|a good action , adventurous film for the family.  I would recommend this film to be on people's watch list.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I really did not want to like this book.  I am not a hiker, backpacker or nature lover.  I got the Kindle sample at the recommendation of several people and was hooked.  There were a couple times that I got a little bored with the story, but overall I could not put it down.  It is ultimately the story of a young woman who wants to find out who she is while dealing with the death of her mother.  Everyone can, in some way, relate to the author of this story.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|This film is hillarious,  we watched and couldn't stop laughing while watching it.  It's a definate reccomendation to watch this!!

B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this all the time.  I even play when I am watching TV.  I have it on my computer, also.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An extraordinary account of extraordinary effort.  I'm glad we have a non-politicized and accurate account of events.  The author's self-deprecating attitude and unwillingness to accept accolades is keeping with the highest military traditions.
B00338QENI|5.0|Once in awhile a story like this comes along and reveals how far we've come.  The author does a superb job of getting the whole sordid mess out there. The book gives one a good look at past moral crevasses and at the same time the reader learns much about the science behind cells and the work that has gone on surrounding them.  Orlon Slax
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn's best work to date.  Unencumbered by romantic involvements, Rapp's character actually becomes more realistic.  The events, though fiction, could be today's headlines.  To folks who have been behind the curtain, allot of this book hit home.  Mr. Flynn did an excellent job of research for this book.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|The game is good though it goes on forever with no real attainable objective.<br />Oh yeah and it is free.
B008AU7F3C|5.0|I love the first 2 songs particularly, as I hear more in the lyrics with each listening.  The midwinter song reallys hits home as I sit watching the snow fall.  this is an album that &#34;haunts&#34; you long after you hear it.

B002ZG983M|5.0|I actually ordered this movie 2 days after I ordered another and it got to my house before the other one. It's in great condition, almost new, in fact it still had some of the movie plastic wrap stuck to the side, no scratches or anything. I love this movie and have been a fan since it came out, i cant wait for kick-ass 2 to come out this summer!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved this app since I first got it. Some people say temple run is better, but I'm against that. If you get subway surfers, you just might be addicted, too!!
B007THA4FI|3.0|As a huge fan of Rowling's Harry Potter series, I was disappointed that none of the creativity of language from that series was evident in this book.<br /><br />While applauding her effort to appeal to a more adult market, I was disappointed in the characters -- none of whom were likeable (with the possible exception of the one who died within the first few pages of the book -- and even that was suspect since we knew him only through recall of the imperfect characters still living). There was insufficient character development to really know any of them so they became one-dimensional characatures of various forms of evil.<br /><br />The local accents also made it difficult to understand the dialogue at times.  I had to reread several of these to know what the characters were saying.<br /><br />The main purpose of my finishing the book was to try to figure out where it was leading.  Unfortunately, the ending was as unsatisfactory as the rest of the book.<br /><br />I do have faith that Rowling's talent for story-telling and language will be more evident in her next novel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surf. Its so addicting and I cant take me eyes off of my kindle! Many people would love Subway Surf
B0053O89JM|5.0|This final Season completes my collection of the show in its entirety.  I've no complaints on this product. It is exactly as I needed.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Half the discs skip so bad that they won't even play. I exchanged them through Amazon, thinking that I had a bad set, but of course my new set skips just as much! Absolutely ridiculous for the amount of money paid for them. And you would think that after 6 years of bad reviews Amazon would stop selling these, but NOPE, still selling terrible quality DVD's.
0804106304|4.0|The Joy Luck Club of Amy Tan held weekly mahjong games, attended by four refugees from the Chinese Revolution, who met at a church welcome center shortly after they arrived in San Francisco.  The four women become close friends, so much so that their children call then Auntie Su, Auntie Lin, Auntie An-mi, and Auntie Ying. They shared secrets around the mahjong games, details of their former lives that they are not comfortable revealing around their families.<br /><br />The Communist Revolution of Mao Zedong began in 1921, and was very active sixteen years later, when Japan invaded China as part of their Far Eastern imperialistic plan.  The Nationalists and Communists postponed their struggle with each other to fight the common enemy, primarily because the common enemy was the most dangerous and closest threat to each side.  When Japan surrendered to America to conclude World War II, the Communists and Nationalists resumed their struggle.  A faltering economy, caused by inflation and corruption of the Nationalism regime, doomed the popularity of the Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek.<br /><br />The Communists promised land reform, securing the loyalty of the peasants through efforts to improve the production of food and to teach literacy.  By October 1949, the Communists had seized control of China, forcing Chiang Kai-Shek to evacuate to Taiwan.  Members of the Nationalist army, the Kuomintang, and wealthy landowners became targets of the Communists in power.  Realizing their peril, families of the Kuomintang and land-owning Chinese fled.  The United States had only repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943, and its quotas for admitting Chinese refugees were small.  Yet, these four members of the Joy Luck Club found a way past the barriers to their entry in America.  In the novel, one of the refugees is given instructions on her presentation to American immigration officials upon arrival in America.<br /><br />The four members of the Joy Luck Club have interestingstories about their background in China.  Each has a daughter groomed for the mah-jong games, held at the home of one of the members, and generally attended by the families.  Whether the games continue or not after the four pass away is irrelevant: it is what the friendships meant to the refugees that drove the story.  However, it does seem a good bet that the mahjong games will continue, as long as the daughters remain in the vicinity of each other.  Although there are some rivalries - particularly between Jin-Mei and Waverly, the daughters of the women are friends.  They talk to each other outside of the Joy Luck Club and refer to each other as friends.<br /><br />The story takes place nearly forty-years after the mothers met at the Refugee Welcome Society in San Francisco, and it is the daughters who are experiencing the kinds of family turmoil that scarred their mothers.  Two are getting divorced, and one is getting remarried.  The other one, Jin-Mei Woo, just had her mother die.  The deceased mother, Suyuan Woo, had mentioned the two daughters she left in the tale of her escape from China, but she never said anything else about them to her daughter.  Jin-Mei learns that the two daughters were regular topics of conversation at the Joy Luck Club, and she is eventually dispatched on an errand regarding her long-lost sisters by the conclusion of the novel.  But how can you find two people in a far-away land of millions, after forty years?<br /><br />The novel focuses on the mother-daughter relationship.  One could consider the novel four puzzles, in which portraits of each mother and daughter are painted through the narration.  The stories were sensational enough to support a critically-acclaimed full-length feature film.  Probably the funniest line in the novel was this remark by one of the mothers:  \\"He called me the worst Fukien landlady, but I am not from Fukien.\\"  While I don't believe this line made it into the film, the movie was enjoyable enough to induceme to read the book - and the book was a very pleasant novel to read.  If anything, the story is moving enough to induce Americans to question the Chinese exclusion immigration laws, which were passed in 1882 and repealed tepidly in 1943 by the Magnuson Act.  Chinese didn't immigrate to America in any meaningful numbers until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished the quotas of the National Origins Formula passed in the 1920s.<br /><br />An alternate theme is the degree that immigrants should Americanize.  Years ago, a 'melting pot theory' was popular, describing the American culture as mixtures of immigrant cultures to form an American culture.  Today, social scientists have promulgated the 'salad bowl theory,' where American culture is comprised of immigrant cultures that retain some of their own identity.  The mothers of the Joy Luck Club worry that their daughters have surrendered their cultural identity in being raised as Americans.

038533348X|5.0|In 1963, when the fear of nuclear annihilation was foremost on the minds of Americans, Kurt Vonnegut wrote Cat's Cradle.  The novel was written just after Khrushchev and Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Cat's Cradle is loosely based on a father of the Manhattan Project, the scientific thrust of America to design and build the nuclear bomb that was eventually denoted on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.  The narrator set out to write a book called \\"The Day the World Died\\" by interviewing the surviving members of the scientist's family, but a push into Bokononism changed his frame of reference.<br /><br />Many consider Robert Oppenheimer the father of the nuclear bomb, but here, the man is Felix Hoenikker, a scientist at the General Forge and Foundry Company in Ilion, NY.  There are elements of Oppenheimer in the fictional scientist of Vonnegut's novel, but Vonnegut based Hoenikker on a scientist he knew from his job at General Electric.  Hoenikker is survived by his three children:  Newt, a dwarf, Angela, a thin, horse-faced woman, and Frank, a drifter.  The narrator also learns that an even more dangerous invention of Felix Hoeniker may exist, a substance called Ice-Nine.<br /><br />The 'vin-dit,' a sudden shove in the direction of Bokononism, occurred in the shop of a maker of tombstones in Ilion.  The town of Ilion in Cat's Cradle is based on Schenectady, NY - one of the tri-cities in Eastern New York State, along with Troy and Albany.  The proprietor of the shop was Avram Breed, quite a coincidence because the narrator just finished visiting the foundry operated by Asa Breed.  Both Breeds were brothers.  Even more coincidental was the story of a gaudy tombstone ordered by an immigrant generations ago.  The name of that immigrant is a sensational detail in the story.<br /><br />Foma is the cornerstone of Bokononism, something that the author believes is true of religion, politics, and maybe even science.  Bokononism is also forbidden in the country of San Lorenzo, yet it is also the national religion of the country.  San Lorenzo is a fictional country in the Caribbean Sea which serves as the location for the second half of the novel.  The national leaders of San Lorenzo secretly practice Bokononism, as do most of the people.<br /><br />There was probably a time, before I was born, when people used these made-up words from Cat's Cradle in everyday conversation.  Using them today will get you a lot of blank looks, but the philosophy behind the novel is timeless. Cat's Cradle is vintage Vonnegut, capturing the concern of the student protest movement about the direction of post-war society, with a slight twist of dark humor that makes the novel a Vonnegut classic.  Along with Slaughterhouse-Five, Cat's Cradle is easily one of the decade's most influential books, and one of the century's most thought-provoking novels.

086571701X|1.0|There is a chapter in the book in which the author recommends that you put salt into your aquaponics system if you suspect you have a fish disease present in order to treat the disease (suspect, not have confirmed by a lab, which is what it really takes). This says it all.<br /><br />She has ignored a basic tenet of aquaponics, which is to NEVER put salt into your system. It kills or stunts the vegetables, depending on the concentration you administer. This is an aquaculture treatment for fish diseases, which works in recirculating aquaculture systems, because they typically dump and exchange 10-20% of their water volume a day and eventually purge the salt out. Aquaponics systems don't dump water, so the salt stays in them, and it kills the plants in short order.<br /><br />Although there are many more gaffes of this sort in the book, this is the most obvious one; and the easiest to explain to newcomers without going into technical and biochemical detail. Although she has no understanding of how aquaponics systems work, she obviously understands how money works. ROTFL, written by a true aquaponics expert.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me and my daughter have a great time playing this game.we enjoy the skill level required<br /> to play. While at the same time.  we can get goofey when we crash and get caught .

0817439390|5.0|When I started reading this book I thought that I'm reading some basic repetitive stuff that every photographer have read and heard thousand times. BUT believe me this book is full of surprises, and lots of tricks and techniques. It will take you to a higher level in your photography career and teaches you how to handle different lighting situations.<br />I highly recommend this book to all serious amateur photographers who wants to make progress in their career.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|I like the case but the stand does not really work.  When I try and use it the case collapes on itself.  It is frustrating.  The elastic band is already starting to lose its elasticity as well.  I like that the is sturdy and fairly easy to use.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game! You have to try it! It is the best game I ever played. I love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME HAS BEEN REALLY FUN. I GET BORED IN TH E WINTER AND THANK GOD I HAD THIS GAME TO PLAY. MY GRANDSON LOVES IT ALSO.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I like this video. I did not realize that it was a series of three 20 min, seperate workouts. I usually do some extra stretching or another activity to get a full work out. Otherwise I do two of the 20 min workouts, starting with a harder one, ending with a lower level so that I don't get too burt out.
0061992860|5.0|This survival guide has it all. I am reading it slowly then re-reading it many many times over and keeping it close to me. It is amazing how much you can learn from such a book like how to attract animals to kill them when you are hungry, and how to build such things needed for survival in the wild. Has lots of pictures and information about the plants that are edible, and deadly to eat... I highly recommend this book! What a gem!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is actually pretty good! The only thing I don't like is how much the characters cost.But for the most part it's a pretty fun and addicting game!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The story was fine; however the text was riddled with sentence fragments and spelling errors. Not worth the frustration in my opinion.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome game worth the money for the full version. It also has a bonus contents . Love this kind of game hope more comes out
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome it tells you how to compete and groom and the graphics are amazing. When you take a picture you feel like you are actually holding a camera and taking a picture.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I found interviews with E.L. James to be lack luster and boring. I found her to be guarded and unwilling to explain her reasoning when writing these books. However, due to the hype by the media, I was extremely curious about all the hoop-la over them and decided to read the first book. I liked the first book so much that I ended up reading the trilogy.<br /><br />I found That James' portrayal of Christian Gray to be deep and complicated. I think she did a very good job of giving this man a history and a reason for his quirks. I found myself thinking he was arrogant and cold in the beginning, but as the story was told, I found myself gradually pulling for Christian. I wanted to see him confront his demons and I also wanted to see him fall in love with Ana.<br /><br />I found the character development very good and very deep. I loved how she gave Ana a strong spirit and unwillingness to bend to everything Christian wanted. At no time did I feel Ana was being roped into something she didn't want or couldn't handle. Ana was true to herself and what she wanted and Christian had to find a way to make that work with what he wanted and in the end, Ana was able to help him ways he never dreamed he could allow.

B006BZ8WAI|5.0|This is a great album,. I will not innumerate the reasons why. At first I was not sold on &#34;Korn III&#34; so I wasn't sure which way Korn was moving. But, I loved this one from song 1. I bought the MP3 version which worked out great for me being as my new computer does not have a DVD drive (that's a different issue...lol)...
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another Vince Flynn masterpiece. I've read most all of his books, and this one doesn't disappoint. As usual another well written story that makes you feel as though you were right there.

B004UID2LC|5.0|I've been looking for an app like this for ages! When I finally found this one, it made things so much better for me and my Kindle.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This season was by far the best for Dexter. The story line is SO INTENSE! I am glad to see they are keeping it on. If you have ever watched even just one episode, you're hooked. You definitely have to add Season 6 to your collection!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I will honestly say that I had never heard of this book until the movie started to come out, but I decided to read it anyways. It was so worth it! This is a great book and great quality.

B006IYG5HE|3.0|the continual shifting back and forth from past to present time kept me totally confused till about halfway through....after that the book was great...can't wait to read the whole Harry Hole series
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Okay this game is so addicting i want to keep playing it all the time its WAY better than the first temple run an  the graphics are awesome. Its a Little hard but its a nice challenge
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I try to enter into the game, but it just shuts down on me. I played it once before this game stooped working. I tried reloading the game, but it only worked once before it shut down. It didn't even remember my score!! My only complaint about the game is that the tilt screen is not sensitive enough. Other than that the game is groovy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this awsome when i get bored i play this game and the boredness goes away get it u heard me please  get it is fuuuuuuun
B00AG6Z92C|1.0|Reminds me when I went to seedy bars with my older brother.  Old, retired people sat there pumping the same songs into the juke box.  Depressing then and depressing now.  On the other hand, the music could be from a \\"Pink Panther\\" era movie.  Has Andrea's voice gone or is he in love and can't sing/write about it?  It may be \\"new\\" to some but they are also trying to push bell bottom jeans...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Such an amazing book. Once I started the Hunger Games I couldn't put it down, as well as Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Truly a great series of books
B000CNESU8|5.0|An excellent copy, and it arrived quickly. This is a film everyone ought to see at least once, but should be viewed multiple times, Still very poignant, and prophetic.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Good book, good plot. The characters were well portrayed. The author did a great job describing everyone and the different places.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|GREAT MOVIE. tHIS WAS ONE OF MY FIRST 3D MOVIES. AWESOME! WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANKS.
B003DCJA94|5.0|A movie that perfectly captures London in the 60's. It still holds up very well today. Cinematography is as good as it gets.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|GREAT BOOK. I TRULY ENJOYED IT AND CAN NOT WAIT UNTIL IT BECOMES A MOVIE. IT WILL BE AN AWESOME MOVIE
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great pack.  I store my Nikon DSLR, 2 extra lens, my Nikon L120, my Canon video camera, extra batteries, mini DVDs, extension cord...  Everything I need.  Plus, the side straps hold my lightweight tripod.  Excellent purchase!
0439023491|5.0|GREAT BOOK. I TOTALLY LOVED IT. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD BUY MORE.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love that you learn about this unique world right along side the characters. Refreshing new story that draws you. Download the preview and you will be hooked!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great flick. A little confusing, but awesome. It will be interesting if they can figure a way to make a second one.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The book was like nothing I'd ever read before.  I bought it because I heard that the movie was difficult to follow, but worth seeing.  I thought that if I read the book, the movie might be less confusing.  I loved the book and it's woven together stories that kept my mind spinning and searching for links.  Now I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out next week.  I also enjoyed the extra section at the end where David Mitchell discusses the process involved in making his novel into a movie...very interesting.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Thank you for buy that movie also cheap money than some shop cost up. but I don't like to wait for sent me mail but nothing to bother to me. I'm good.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Don't listen to most of the bad feedback.  Why?  Well because they most probably are idiots.  Plain as that.  This little, cheap tri-pod does get the job done, the thing is that since it has a spring, YOU DON'T FORCE IT.  It's common sense.  It perfectly fit my Ipod 4th gen. which is way thicker than an Iphone... so the problem with it breaking is entirely the owner's fault.  Since it is a relatively cheap product, it is in fact made of plastic, and the bottom of the legs do slip a bit, but what were you expecting for the price you payed?  Overall it gets the job done, if you want to blast on it, don't get yourself one just go the extra mile and buy one that's $20-$30.  It was delivered on time and in good shape.<br /><br />Hope I didn't offend anyone, and hopefully this helps! :)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Perfect, 8 different movies. Easy save than each other 8 DVDs cost about $80. So I just want to thank you for this
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was a great read and I am looking forward to more in this series.  I would decrease my rating if the series ends here.
0385523912|5.0|I have always wondered what North Korea looked like or how people lived under such a closed and backwards socialist society. I must say, this book has been one of the best reads of my life. The author's literary style and her deep knowledge of the North Korean politics and society makes this an absolutely great read - it is a page-turner. I just finished reading it recently, and I remember how I used to summarize parts of the book to my wife with passion and heartfelt sympathy for a whole nation that lives under the tyranny of a messed-up authoritarian regime. Whether you are into politics or not, pick this book, because it provides a thrilling and rich experience - you get to appreciate the life you live!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I liked this one. It was a bit long but never-the-less held my interest all the way through from the beginning.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|i have read most of his books! but this by far is the best one! 2nd time reading it and still couldnt put it down!!
B000UZNRS2|3.0|Too many themes going on at the same time with each theme having a very large cast of characters! This seems to be the norm for Baldacci because he did the same thing in The Forgotten. He keeps you interested but you find yourself trying to identify the character when he switches gears from one theme to the other as you go thru the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers IS AMAZING and its about people who subway surf as they are being chased by a police officer because of the character vandalizing a train and once you play enough it goes from the location New York America to Rio Brazil. This is so far the best game this year you guys will love it!!! &lt;3
B00B935SUY|5.0|A great story about people making music and a magical board that produced a one-of-a-kind sound. If you're not affected by Dave Grohl's enthusiasm for this project, then you must be half dead. A must watch for everybody.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its fun and freeeeeeee<br /><br />Horsys are fun<br /><br />And they are so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so cute!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the most Fun apps I've played. It will have you addicted and with all the different updates including new characters and boards there is always something new.I would highly recommend you to get this app. It is a game anybody would love.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers could keep me busy for decades!!! I love this game. It has different versions too!!! I would recommend this game to somebody who likes temple run it is the same thing but more fun.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Keith Richards's life story is not so different than you might find from other rock 'n rollers of his day, but his book is very interesting and well-written. I'd recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Everyone kept saying I needed to read this book. Once I started reading I didn't want to put it down. Although I disagree with the bondage activities, I wanted to see if the relationship continues. Ready for next book

B004MC8CA2|4.0|This version has many languages to it.  I am finding it had to set up an account with this version.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's enjoyable and easy. My kids like watching me play too. Something quick and simple to pass the time. Good times!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it's so fun and all different places and characters you can be and you can jump on subway trains and collect coins.

B002BWP4A6|5.0|I noticed a great polarity in the reviews, which intrigued me into watching this film. After all if a film can generate this much polarization it could only mean one thing: it must be tapping into something unexpected and worth watching! I am not a film buff or an expert. I simply enjoy good intelligent storytelling, and I prefer thought provoking subjects. With that... In this film, the audience is really a passive observer. At no point is the director forcing his own views onto the audience. He is essentially a facilitator, giving us a window into this world. For this reason, each person watching this film will have their own unique experience or take away. How I would understand it will differ from someone else because I will be interpreting it through my own mental biases or values. And that is what makes this film interesting.  After all, the reality of human nature and its history is full of gray areas; nothing is purely black or white and this film is a great demonstration of this. The narrator and his idealized love are the only things to come across as good and empathetic. But we have to remind ourselves that HE is telling the story so his version is inherently biased, skewing favorably towards himself. He is inevitably painting a more favorable and forgiving account of events when it comes to himself. If we were given the story from the perspective of the vicar for example, it no doubt would have been a completely different narrative. It was interesting to see that the younger children, not yet altered by their environment, were kinder, more beautiful, and comforting to watch. They were innocent, representing the idealized version of who we think we are as humans. Teenagers and adults, those already affected by politics, religion, hardship, injustice, inequality and ... are the offensive creatures. Unlike some other reviewers, for me, the movie did not end abruptly. I felt it made the point it was trying to make. And there was still something left to ponder. This is not a mystery, thriller, or &#34;who done it&#34; type of movie. If you watch it for these reasons you will be disappointed. Haneke may be tough on his audiences, but he respects their intelligence. He is an auteur. I personally very much enjoyed this film - not as entertainment but rather as a philosophical piece.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I just couldn't stop reading once I started my first book. I thought it would have ended differently because of how the characters craved each other's love and affection.
0767802470|2.0|This review is for the Director's Cut version of the DVD. After all the good reviews on Amazon and from others, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Thankfully, I rented it.<br /><br />After about 1 hour and 15 minutes, I turned it off. To sum it up: BORING.<br /><br />So what happens during the first 1 hour and 15 minutes? There is a party. Then they set sail in das boot. They have no specific orders...just cruise around the ocean. They are spotted by a destroyer. They endure depth charges. They keep sailing.<br /><br />Some people will likely critique my review, saying that war can be boring. That's fine. I'm not at war. I'm watching a movie. Good movies are not about hum-drum everyday life. They have some substance. This movie has no substance. At least Seinfeld (a TV comedy series about nothing) has something to offer. Das Boot--the Director's Cut has very little to offer. After watching and waiting for something to happen for 1.25 hours, I wasn't about to waste another couple of hours on this extended version of the movie in hopes that something would happen.<br /><br />Visit my Amazon wish lists to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3DU5CH5ZFWRNI/<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/24H8TDYHFDOET/
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is super fun. new location, a bigger, scarier monkey, and other cool stuff too. u should get it if u like the first temple run.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The characters draw you in to their stories. It is sad & funny and leaves you feeling hopeful.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I just love the Jack Reacher novels but this isnt one of Lee Child's best. It seems Lee is turning Jack into more of a detective/cop in this book. I like it more when Jack only helps the authoritys from the background and a little more anonymously. It adds more suspense and mystery to the books. Still, its Jack Reacher!!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Gripping.  The movie moved very quickly.  Bigelow's visual sense is enough to sell a movie, but it's also well plotted and features a great performance by Chastain.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great app worth it so stop using free version. Try seed smaller than life flat with a few islands. Try seed 101.
B0014DQSGW|5.0|I love this movie.  I enjoy feel good movies that aren't full of sex and violence.  And although the Hugh Grant character sleeps with plenty of women, it's not done on screen.  (This is not a &#34;paid&#34; review.)
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was good until the last third. Then it actually became boring so I don't know what all the hype is about regarding how &#34;great&#34; it is.  Hope the movie will be more interesting.  It was an anticlimactic book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. The graphics are great. The only flaw is that my friends got the new update 4 days ago. Amazon Appetite sucks. Notice: I am using my moms kindle.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It has its moments and it wants you to like on Facebook but I don't have a Facebook but it is very fun
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It is the coolest game every shooting acorns and collecting coins. It is so so so so so so so so fun you should really try it. There was a first one but this way better.SAVE THE IRISH.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game thank you.  keep up the great work. hope you come up with more great ideas. Lynn
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is sooooooooooo fun! In this game, which is very kid friendly, you are running from a police officer. You can collect coins along the way and jump on and off of train cars. You can use your coins to buy new charactors and power-ups, like a jetpack, shoes that make you jump really high, and more.<br />  My favorite part of this app is that it changes all the time. There is a Christmas version, a normal version, an island version, and many more. It is really fun to find out which version it is going to be next.<br />  This is my favorite app, and I am sure you will love it too.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Although the film was visually stunning,the film was poorly written, the characters were not very believable and  I found it difficult to sit through the entire film.  I just felt like it was a terrible waste of my time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game it fun to play I playing against my friends on Facebook and play with my family and each one beating each other's score
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app. If you liked temple run you will love this game granted. Temple run 2 is way better than temple run. There is now a goal that you are running for. I like how there are now zip lines and mines. It makes the game so much funnier. You should really buy this app readers. Also,the good thing about this awesome app is that it's free! I hope you like it, Or love it!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Awesome girl
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesomely addictive! Great missions and challenges.  Be sure to log on each day for daily challenges.  So much fun for the whole family!
B000KP62MA|5.0|I've known 30 Seconds to Mars for a long time and I always wanted to have this CD because of the band but if you are not a fan and would like to get to know 30 Seconds to Mars, buy this CD. We will be able to see the making of of one of the best videos of the band, &#34;The Kill&#34;, get to know their work and experience one of their best CDs (my favorite one if the Self Title, 30 Seconds to Mars).
0812993357|4.0|Grace is an in-depth, eye opening memoir of Grace Coddington, Creative Director at Vogue. The movie, The September Issue, launched Grace into the public consciousness and began the idea of writing a memoir. It seems the stubborn back and forth between Grace and Anna Wintour was intriguing to the watching population. They wanted to know more about this woman who dared argue her point to the Editor-in-Chief, Anna Wintour.<br /><br />Grace grew up in Wales, with dreams of one day experiencing magical scenes, like those she saw in her magazines. She wanted to work for Vogue, what she deemed to be the preeminent fashion magazine. That became the goal in her life, to be a part of the art of fashion. Not necessarily always to be in fashion and dressed to the nines herself, but to be able to create scenes that make people dream. To transport them from their day to day, to the image on the page, even if for just a few minutes. Her memoir is full of funny, sad, detailed memories of photo shoots, her early modeling days, home life, work life, colleagues and her cats.<br /><br />Grace is a wonderful memoir, giving a peek into and celebrating the full and abundant life of Grace Coddington.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book for the purpose of review.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|The camara does not take photo's as I thought it would.  You have to hold the thing facing away from you to get a photo and you cannot see what in the heck you are getting in the frame.  Unless you stand on your head, or twist sideways and try to focus the camara you might as well forget it.  :(
1594487154|2.0|I loved Pink's first two books. Unfortunately this one's pretty thin conceptually, reads like an aggregation of pop culture research and wisdom, and lacks a compelling purpose. Yeah we get it: persuasion is a form of selling. Sharing ideas, theories and beliefs all involve something that at the least common denominator could be loosely  categorized as selling. And you attract more flies with honey than poo. Not exactly rocket surgery.<br />I recently heard Mr. Pink on NPR and essentially he gave away the store in 30 minutes of chat. Find the podcast and save some money.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Helps me with the weight of holding the Kindle because I have arthritis in my hands and they get tired.  Not that the Kindle itself is heavy, it is just with the problem of my hands.  Love it, can prop it up without making my wrist and fingers hurt.
B009Y6OIWC|4.0|Calendar is awesome, works great on Android phone and Kindle Fire HD. BUT Kindle Fire HD can't read all calendars. For example, On the web and my phone, I have full access to my_name@my_companys_name.com and my_bosses_name@my_companys_name.com (this is a g-mail / google docs account). But the kindle can't read my_bosses_name.
B0030B624E|5.0|I like the series The Walking Dead so while the show is on break I watched this. Pretty good movie! Loved Woody Harrelson and the guest surprise of Bill Murray!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game eve. Good time waster and VERY addicting. I love trying to beat frRiends on Facebook. It's just like Temple Run but only more fun.
0375851569|5.0|These were a great find for our boys. I remember having them as a kid and our boys still love reading them.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I usually love Michael Connelly's books but was disappointed in this one. I think he haswritten much better books. I won't hesitate to read his next one but hope he's up to his best writing.
B00427X9WI|5.0|This was bought and a gift and the receipient loved it. We shopped around and found the best price here.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I often use this app to pick out a tune as I hear it -- helps to commit it to memory.  Also handy for demonstrating intervals to vocalists when no piano is available.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|When I read the Lincoln lawyer I didn't know what to expect. After finishing it I had to read more. Time just flies when reading this book.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I got this free app just days after getting my new kindle fire HD.  I like the look and works great.  I like that it tells me how long to expect my battery to last based on different functions of my kindle, like listening to music or surfing the web.  Good deal!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was really fun and challenging. The ending left it open for a second game; I can hardly wait for it to come out!
B00770KR7W|4.0|receiver said he liked it,  halo anything. . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game, alot of fun and addictive. Started out in NY now I'm in Rio. Reminds me of growing up in NY. Good for your hand to eye coordination. Your always planning a little ahead for your next move. Great on Kindle...
B008HK3XU4|5.0|My daughter likes this case.  Color is nice and its not as thick as some of the other covers I,ve seen.  Works good
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is tons of fun. The only beef I have is that it takes a ridiculous amount of character tokens to unlock characters. Other than that the game is pretty much perfect. :)
B000KJT8IG|5.0|SO FUNNY AND CAN WATCH IT EVERY YR OVER AND OVER.  Great entertainment for guests, too.  It's a classic movie.
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|I tried twice to play this game  and it  froze my kindle the first time and it would not let me go forward on the second time .  won't try again!!!!!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a marvelous biography.  We'll be discussing it in our Book Club on Wednesday.  The book gives an excellent though still incomplete picture of a genius as well an historical account of the forming of a great company.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an addicitve game that wont allow me to put it down. Playing against friends and unlocking characters and many other features adds an entertaining view of the game. Get it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really enjoy the challenge this game provides.  My 4 yr old loves to play this game as well. Especially since there are not to many games he can play.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the movie to come out so that I can put faces to the characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is even better than 1!! I play this all the time its one of my favorite apps. works great on kindle and ipad. totally a great buy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The ending threw me. As I sat for a moment after I was done, I wanted to be angry, but the more I thought about it the more I realized the reader doesn't  need to know anymore to understand this is a phenomenal book.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|Right price.  Easy hook up from TV to Receiver and the sound is good.  No problems with hissing or anything like that.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I like. Its cute<br />Graphics are cool and animals are fun. You can breed animals and feed them after rescue.
B00AHGH6XQ|5.0|package got to my house quickly and i loved how it was actually the 2 disc edition not on blue ray. Perfect for my xbox and lab top
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I wasn't really sure about buying this game for my fire. I am so glad I did! Many levels and different color schemes are keeping me entertained. The added bonus level to work toward is a plus as well. $2 well spent.
B000NY12CI|5.0|I knew very little of the belief's held by the Muslim people. This book shed light on a belief system that subjugates women with mental depression and many times physical abuse. The reader travels with the author from her disruptive childhood, her teen age years and the study of the Quran and her total indoctrination and absorption with Allah to her rejection of an arrnanged marriage and her move to Holland and the beginning of individual freedom.<br />It is an amazing journey that we in the West find almost incomprehensable.I now pray every day for Muslim women thruout the world, that they find courage to reject the tryany of abuse fostered on them by men who use the belief in Allah to exert their power and total control.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great action and visual imagery, however disappointed that the ending didn't match the action.  It felt like it just ended.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have been using this app on my Kindle Fire for about a month now.  It is easy to use, provides the information clearly, and delivers it all in an entertaining format.  Checking in on this app has become part of my morning routine immediately following my perusal of the morning headlines.<br /><br />I would not know what to do without it.  A great little app.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was suspenseful and romantic! the perfect combination!!  A quick easy read for romantics(:  now I can't wait to see the movie!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Build up was nice, loses its way as we get into the second half. Special effects aren't great either, can watch at home when nothing to do
B0093X805W|5.0|All kids should read this book . A word is in the book I didn't pay attention to that .Read more of Roald Dahl .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game this game is the best tam ever u should get this game if u have it on your phone that's good but on the kindle it is a bigger screen and it is sooooooooooo amazon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love that there is some details in the game I like they in games it's fun and very cool
B00992CF6W|5.0|It won't update to updates that are out on like all other devices. It's still fun though. Get it!!!! It's not worth $6.99 it's worth at least $13.99.
B009DKCBM8|5.0|If you enjoy Neil, you will enjoy this. If you have to spend too much time analyzing it, you're missing the point. This is music. This Neil. Crank it up and head down that Hippie Highway. It's Cortez the Killer Neil. Crafty Neil. All Neil. Buy it. Then try to turn it off. WOW!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Seriously addicted. Good thing it's not on my work computer or I'd be in big trouble.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app! It ia everything you need in an app! Whoever made this app is AWESOME.!!!!!!I would love to be the creater of this app!thanks!<br /><br />  Thanks,<br />.  Taytayhorn12345
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best g as Mrs I have ever played I would rate 10 stars but there is only 5 tons of fun I totally recommend it to anyone who likes temple run
0307744434|5.0|This was a great read, imaginative story and incredible depth of character.  the descriptions are beautiful and paint pictures as you read.  Loved ever moment of it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very fun and addictive game. I love trying to pass my Facebook family and friends.I would recommend this app to all my friends that want to play it.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|it's a good game, but you have to purchase points to get hello kitty and a host of others, but the actual game is nice
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game I have ever played. The game has world tour's. Plus special people you can buy on world tour's.[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B00B2V66VS|5.0|kids love this game almost as much as temple run 1 and i like it too. it's a great game to say it's free
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because it's fun and the multiplier helps u with your math<br />I want the character Zoe but I don't have a lot of coins
B0086700CM|5.0|my girls play this game often and love it. i suck at it and still try and always die, i like it though
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway rider is a great game that keeps me busy.<br />It is one of the most entertaining free apps.<br />There are some little glitches in the game but it,s still fun.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|omg i love this app. it lets you control what sounds you want and exactly what level volume you want each sound. you can set a timer on it too. it's a must have if you have any trouble sleeping or just like to feel  in a dream world of relaxation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever I love it so much<br />It is so fun never freezes but I wish the gems would be free
B007B6VOG0|5.0|i love this album, it gets me in a great mood. every morning i play it while bringing kids to school.  there are 2-3 curse words on the whole album and i know so well, i know when to pass up certain points on a song for kids.  brings me back to the 80's music era when everything was simple in life.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Another great addition by Cohen.  Together with the &#34;Book of Longing&#34; this is a nice addition by the master.  I can add little.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I began watching the show and thought the music was cool.So I ordered the cd.I admit that I was dissapointed that the song 'fade into you' wasn't on the soundtrack.Well,if they release a volume 2 soundtrack,maybe that song can be found on the next soundtrack.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|seriously whoever is complaining about the dvd's being on 2 spindles, must have never gotten a pack of blank cd's before, because they are packed the same way! I think it was a very smart way to pack the disks so they don't slide around and cause scratches or become dislodged or what-not. Mine came in perfect condition! This also saves ALOT of space! The only thing thats a little odd is the theme song is only in seasons 1 and 2, I believe it was, all the other seasons have kinda an instrumental thing going on. But for 32 disks of all 11 seasons for 30 bucks (I got mine new/used) , I wont complain!
1591840562|5.0|This is a must read for hopeful entrepreneurs.  Kawasaki is full of practical advice.  Easily in my top 3 business books.
B002M87V0A|1.0|This is a great film, it has the potential to be a great bluray, however there is one small detail.  I won't receive this film for a week or more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not a big science fiction fan so I was a little worried about how this book would pan out.  All I can say is wow.  You will not be disappointed.  One of the most addicting series I have ever read.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really enjoy this app. The puzzles are fun and they add new ones all the time. The only downside is the occasional glitch.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|A departure from the Angry Bird series but that's a good thing in my opinion.  The game takes the perspective of the pigs and instead of mindlessly firing birds with a slingshot the user has to build a contraption to steal eggs from the birds.  Takes more thought than angry birds which may or may not be what the gamer is looking for.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Amazing, coming of age film. Had me laughing, and nearly to tears. I could really feel Charlie's emotions during the movie.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Really addicting game.  A lot like sodoku but creates a picture at the end.  Takes some thinking but it is fun if you like that in a game.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Fun game but much too short...very easy and quickly conquered. Even my kids found it easy and finished it fast.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|i bought this for my gopro hero so i could record steady shots for longboarding and it sure does the job. if you are going to use a gopro you will need to buy a $1 0gopro tripod mount so it will screw to the opteka. Otherwise great product!
B0017I1IZA|3.0|Quick reads for traveling. But a bit simple. Lula needs to b a bit deeper not so foolish. How many times can the same thing happen to a person b4 it gets REALLY old?
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I do not find this on my Kindle Fire.  It says I have it but do not know where it is
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was definitely an easy read but it really lacked for me. It was slow to begin with and sorta picked up in the second half. I felt like she just left us hanging at the end, no resolve with any of the characters. Not my choice of books, but wasn't terrible for light reading.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|I received the product in perfect condition, both the sound and the picture quality is very good, it's like you're at the stadium in the middle of the concert really is a very good quality product sumac recomendale for all people who U2 likes will not regret
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a wonderfully addicting game, that is fun for all ages. My mom watchs me while I play, which is quite often. I would recommend it to anyone!!!!
B001NXBRJG|5.0|The shipment arrived before the agreed date everything perfect sound quality and picture is awesome many thank you very much very good presentation at an affordable price
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Imangi Studios has done a fabulous job putting together an exciting, challenging and entertaining game to keep you coming back for more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice app overall but I wish it was a tiny bit more interactive. Like when in competitions or training you actually control the horse.
B001ED7C5I|4.0|This was a christmas gift for my mother and she loves it.  The songs are great and different than her other cds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game... I call it a glue game once you play it you stuck on it....Good luck.. best game ever... I like rio
B004P12SSW|5.0|I loved this movie. Christina Aguilar was amazing in it. Must see movie. Great story. Great acting. Uplifting. Music and dancing was awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is my favorite game I can't stop paying. My favorite part is buying new players and earning coins.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Loved this movie. I honestly was not a fan of Ben Affleck till I saw this movie. I have a lot of respect for him now as an actor. Must see movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's pretty fun. In my opinion think it's better than temple run. And the characters are more interest in and u can go different places around the world
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Never dull nor boring! Great book! I would Recommend to anyone who likes a good love story. Wouldn't have changed a word.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie, but it left much to be desired. If you are not acquainted with the stage production, I would recommend this. It is an inexpensive introduction to a beautiful, passionate musical.  However, those who have fallen in love with past productions of this musical may be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Some things the movie does well...<br /><br />  -Anne Hathaway's performance of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\". This number is raw and heart-wrenching, and it effectively portrays the misery and hopelessness of Fantine's position.<br /><br />  -Samantha Barks as Eponine. With her powerful voice and acting ability, she nails the part. The movie may be worth watching simply for her performance. If only some of the other actors had taken notes from her.<br /><br />  -The movie communicates Victor Hugo's message of the power of Christian forgiveness more clearly than some of the stage productions.<br /><br />However, while some of the actors get along swimmingly, all is not well.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is with Russell Crowe's performance. As Inspector Javert, he has two substantial solos and is present throughout the movie. Unfortunately, he cannot sing. Russell Crowe is one of my favorite actors, but in casting a musical acting and fame are not the only qualifications. He does not have a powerful voice, and must leave out notes from the original production that seem to be out of his range. (Check out Terrence Mann's performance of \\"Javert's Suicide @ 1:39-1:50 [...]).<br /><br />Hugh Jackman and Amanda Seyfried's acting in the film is entertaining, but their singing is also disappointing.<br /><br />Sadly, these issues distracted from the high points in the movie. It is painful to listen to performers struggling to hit their notes correctly.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are expecting this to be like the stage performance, you are in for a disappointment. If you are just curious what \\"Les Miserables\\" is about, check it out, you will find a well-acted film with a moving message. Someday, go see the play.ind a well-acted film with a moving message. Someday, go see the play.
0143120530|2.0|I struggle to stay awake reading this one. It rambles on and offers little constructive info. I have yet to reach mid point and am hopeful the book will improve.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|i love having my music available all of the time. so, i am posting this review so that you trust this product
B00B19DMUE|5.0|It was the perfect blend of eerie, psycho and parts that left you feeling just a bit creeped out. Loved It!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the best game ever. It is fun for every one.fun games.fun stuff.fun adventures.I love it.it was free too.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book is an exciting read. It also raises intriguing questions about our own humanity and what it means to be human.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|I actually liked the movie.  It was well made and the story was good as well.  It had several problems though, like dancing didn't fit the period for one. While I can easily imagine that a werewolf is possible I can't imagine people surviving in winter wearing summer clothes.  Nor sleeping naked on the snow with most of their body exposed and actually waking up in the morning.  They would be dead of exposure by then.  The devil is in the details.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great, especially for the little ones. Hours of fun and excitement . My daughter was very excited to find unicorns in the mix.
B00B0ND67K|5.0|As a long time Kenny Loggins fan, I was curious If I'd enjoy this trio as much as his duets with Messina  or his solo career. This album did not disappoint and it was great to hear him harmonizing with these talented musicians. Very excited about this new venture for all three and look forward to even more!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I had not wanted to buy this book in the beginning and ended up breaking down and getting it as a little gift for myself. I have to say that I made a great choice.<br /><br />I love everything from the storyline and the characters to the humour and everything in between I highly recommend it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app....i have always wanted a horse of my own though. :) horses are amazing! lol if you love horses you should get this app...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|sooo much better than the first one. much more exiting and interesting. at first it had some errors but not anymore. love it
B000EZ7ZZE|5.0|Probably the best in the series in my opinion. I felt they did good with this movie in terms of special effects and how it was shot.Good story-line, characters and action. It was non-stop fun from the beginning.<br />PS: Blu-ray copy had a lot of special features, deleted scenes and extras.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|THIS IS A MODERATELY ENTERTAINING MOVIE, THOUGH A LITTLE PREDICTABLE.  EASTEOOD IS MORE FEISTY THAN EVER, BUT IF HE FACED HIS AGING PROBLEM AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS DAUGHTER AND OTHERS, THERE WOULD BE LESS HUMOR BUT A BETTER MOVIE.  IT'S WOR THE THE TIME TO VIEW IF ONLY TO SEE A CANNY ACTOR AT HNIS BEST.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so awesome! so cool! SO FUN!!!! I really love this app! I cant put my kindle down! everyone needs this app! :D
B003B02O7I|4.0|IT WOULD BE HARD TO PICK THE BEST OF ALLTHE THIRTY OR SO GRISHAM NOVELS I HAVE READ, BUT THIS WOULD BE NEAR THE TOP.  BY FAR BEST ADVENTURE INTO THE BRAZILIAN JUNGLE I HAVE READ.  GREAT RESEARCH MUST HAVE BEEN DONE FOR THIS UNUSUAL AND PAGE TURNING SAGA.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Great band.  Truly fantastic.  Love that downloads from Amazon play in iTunes, too.  Support good music, and the Lumineers are definitely good.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Amazing writers!  I get so upset when it's not on on Sunday, I look forward to it all week.  Actors, scenery, fantastic!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I feel like I have my own horse. I feel like I have a bond. . . . I do. . .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much! It is so fun I cant pull my self away from it! I love all the fun games you play with your horse!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I'm new to this band, but after hearing their singles on the radio, I decided to pick up the album. I'm glad I did; this is a very solid presentation of consistently good music. There's one song I'd rate about a 3-star, but that's just my personal taste, and I love the rest of the album; I don't want to name the song I didn't like as well here, because I think it might grow on me with time. :)
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I was pleasently surprised at how I was captivated by this book. It was full of surprises.<br />I Loved it
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is a awesome book and it is tied with the first book in the series but it is the last one
B000BO0QHW|5.0|I bought this music with hopes of what I thought it would be and was delightfully laid back with what I heard. Can't put it into words, so you'll have to give it a listen yourself; I feel sure it'd be a nice addition to anyone's library who enjoys the sort of jazzy, slightly bluesy, soft music w/ a little vocals here and there.  :)
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like it. It's fun but there are alot of pop ups. That's really the only bad thing I have to say about it. It updates it's self
B0083EXW50|5.0|The Industrialist is right up there with Mechanize and Obsolete. One of their hardest yet, and I love the machine gun-like drums. As usual these albums deal with man vs a dystopian, dehumanizing corporation/government/religion. The individual consciousness against the collectivist mind-hive. Great themes! My favorite is God Eater and Landfill (which is available as an extra song on the special edition).
B0071XO8RA|4.0|If you like sci-fi, and feeling absorbed in a story, I don't think you can go wrong with reading Wool Omnibus aka silo series. I am going to leave the rest up to you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want mine craft but I'm not paying 6.99 for a game if you lower the price to like  $0.99 cents more people will like the game more because being so expansive we cant get it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app. I love feeding and training these horses. This app is fun and interesting for a kid to play. Good kid.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|This is a very cute movie for a family movie night. However, my 1 year old was freaked out by the cute little yellow guys and cried every time he saw them. The rest of us really enjoyed the crazy characters and humor.
6301986024|5.0|The box, tape, and service were excellent. The price was great, I just love these older movies. Steve is one of my favorites.
B0057LUI0O|4.0|We bought this for a family movie night and were suprised how much we all enjoyed it. The characters are fun and the music made my kids and me want to get up and dance.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The selection to choose from is good.The scenery and sound quality is above average. I. would highly recommend this app. It is really nice after a long and stressful day.
B00356CO1E|5.0|I wanted to start working out again, but as a working mom, I don't have much time. In 20 minutes, Jillian gets me going and sweating and back in shape. I've been doing it for a couple of weeks and have been very happy with the results. My friends and husband have noticed the difference in my body, too.
B00AE2I4B6|5.0|It was not the best acting in the world but the story line was good and the dancing was great.
B00475BUVM|5.0|This version is definitely better than the original clash. This is by far more technical. The 3d is mind bending. Great entertainment for whole family. Recommended.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game so much. The puzzle of how to get the water from point A to point B is challenging and getting all of the gnomes is like a second challenge. I completed all the levels and then uninstalled just so I could reinstall and unlock all the levels and challenges all over again.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I bought this album for the new hit song but ended up loving each and every song on it listening to it over and over again!!!!! can't get enough of my Bruno Mars
B00684J49U|5.0|IF you love Grey's you'll love the complete 8th season, It's a must see in, I just wish season 9 would hurry up and come out, the clif hanger on 8 was just uncalled for!!  How am I to wait so long to find out how everything ends up!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazingly written trilogy with a great story line. A story that has had too much hype about its sexual content which is only part of a bigger picture.
B001BLH10O|5.0|This movie was great ! The steelbook is cool ! The special effects of the movie where great ! My friends and i totally enjoyed the whole film !  I would recomend this movie !

B007N5YIUS|5.0|Easy download to my KindleFire HD - no hassels.  Since I had this on my original Kindle Fire, I thought when I downloaded this and my other Angry Birds games that the progress I had on them would come up, but they didn't.
034544678X|5.0|What I love about Patricia's book is she speaks about dogs in a language people can understand.  Too many of the dog behavior books read like a manual that tells how to put together a swing set or something that requires nuts and bolts. I have to pinch myself to stay awake. But Patricia's voice and experience that she shares in her writing  is more like a story that you can read and understand because of the visualization a that she creates in the various stories she tells about her own dogs and the dogs she has worked with. But she tells you through the eyes of a human. Her approach is witty and fun which makes it easy to remember her point. I finally found something that makes sense, is enjoyable to read, and helps me better understand my own dogs. Thank you Patricia for your book!
B009ZQRS2I|4.0|Superber acting by the two lead co-stars especially Jude Law. The film in similar in concept to \\"Inception\\" but not as expensively produced.<br /><br />If you like sci-fi and thrillers you will like this one.<br /><br />If you like this movie, you are also more likely to love \\"Gattaca\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You want to play all the time cuz there is so many cool characters you want to buy; and the surf boards make your level last longer to get more coins. Love this game
B000I8G5B2|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! Great acting, exciting topic, and thrilling. After a long time, finally there is sci-fi movie that is gripping!<br /><br />Other movies like this is \\"Contact but Gattaca moves faster.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome still as good as season 1 I'm so addicted to this series and I used to not watch zombie stuff!!
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|While episode itself is magnificent, it had stopped at least 6-7 times during my viewing and I had to re-start it all over again. Instead of 1 hour, it took me 2 and a half hours to finish.
B00005JNEW|5.0|There was no damage to anything. Also a very good movie. I would tell all my friends to buy this movie.
B008MM9630|4.0|The best thing is you don't have to have anyone else to play or internet . Easy fun<br />But you do have to gems if you want to advance which cost less than some other games I played
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is a big improvement over temple run with the power ups and better graphics but the game glitches out almost every time I use the &quot;save me&quot; feature which is really, REALLY annoying. I lose my gems, my score, and my coins every time it glitches out. Fix this!!!!!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This was a good book with an interesting viewpoint. I had several friends who had read it and enjoyed it so I thought I would give it a try. I liked it but not as much as the hype.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun and the best game ever me and my friends play all day. I can't stop playing with this game.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I couldn't wait to get home from work to play each day. Kept my interest all week. Definitely. worth the three bucks.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Where did all these friends come from?  When I signed up for Facebook I was looking for a short and easy way to communicate with my family members; as it turned out I was communicating with the world.  I started getting request for &#34;I want to be your friend&#34; to &#34;Flo added her 18 friends to your FB&#34;.  Being a new user it was a lot of &#34;who is this person?&#34;  Do I need to talk to them?<br />My email is almost impossible to manage now--over a 100 a day.<br />I like the concept but not the results.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like Angry Birds.  Levels are challenging, you get ads, but just X them out.  After all, it it a free game.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This is great, I do not need to carry my lap top to keep up with the weather.<br />This app gives me the weather with one key click.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I like this game.  Some of the levels are quite challenging and you have to figure out how to exactly attack.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It's an ok game but mojang put out a new update 4 android/ios but not kindle they suck 4 that
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It just wasn't as exciting as the first 2 books. The story took a long time to get interesting. I'm not sure I like the ending either.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Everytime i get to 100,000 points it starts to force closes on me. I know its not my device. I have uninstalled this app 3x already. Not sure what the problem is hope it can get fixed. Besides that i love the game waaaaay better than the first. :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very good book. I couldn't stop reading it. I think it could relate to a lot of people. Very good.
1932100660|5.0|In an age of crises, of media blitz campaigns both written and in that ominous Cloud where all data on everything and everyone is stored and available for dissecting, this volume THE CHINA STUDY by Doctors Campbell is fresh and illuminating. Early on in this tome we read, `'Hippocrates said, `There are, in effect, two things: to know and to believe one knows.  To know is science. To believe on e knows is ignorance.' And what follows in this book is a close examination or scrutiny of nutrition and how it affects health and disease.<br /><br />Though the book is lengthy and dense it is surprisingly easy to read and understand. The Campbells wade through the various obsessions about weight control that come from (on the positive side) nutritionists and health gurus, to companies who are involved in the `health industry' with such plans as prepared meals for dieting, groups who gather like AA clones  in the often lost battle to get thin, to `scientific articles' that take a small study and show us why we should avoid certain foods only to bow out within a year or so having found another wayward dietary measure that guarantees health, etc.  This book shows how the growing epidemic of obesity in this country has nurtured Medicine Man Wagons who play on the fear of overweight citizens in order to make money - the big culprits being the food industry - and encouraged those lobbyists who pester the national government to foster communication for the good of corporate greed and not for the health of the citizenry.<br /><br />But politics aside (and that is a big part of the message in this study) the main message here is to alter our perception of what foods are healthy and how we can so easily change our eating habits by depending on plants and whole foods  instead of animals as our food source. No, this is not a treatise on vegetarianism.  Instead this is an explanation about how our preference for animal products (`protein source') is a misconception that has foster the persistent proliferation of cancer, cardiovascular disease, the effect on early aging, obesity, diabetes, and other malfunctions of the human organism.  It is an eye-opening study that is certain to benefit all those who commit to the time to read it. At least the reader will be informed as to the misconceptions that the obesity epidemic has fostered.  From that point, the progress is up to us. `Eating the right way not only prevents disease but also generates health and a sense of well-being, both physically and mentally.'

B009AMALGM|5.0|I rented this movie today thinking it was going to be bad because of the poor ratings here.  Well, it made me jump several dozen times, even made me yip and scream.  I had to cover my eyes a few times.  I watch alot of horror movies and this was very frightening without all of the blood and guts.  The plot was okay and tied in with the first movie.  The ending had a very odd twist.  I liked it alot and won't forget the imagery and shock value anytime soon.
0385751060|5.0|Even though the story is fictional. It gives a point of view of one of the worst moments in world history through the eyes of 2 children.
B004YOEFG8|2.0|After about 10 min. of watching the 3-D version we were all starting to get headaches.<br /><br />So we switched over to 2-D. The 2-D version is not in high-definition.<br /><br />2-D in standard definition is still better than the torture of 3-D.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very good game! I loved how it had emphasised temple run and added a jungle adventure into it!
B005LAIHR2|1.0|Has to be in my top ten of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I grew up in the 80's and loved the music of that time, but this movie flat out stinks!  I gave it one star because negative 10 wasn't an option.
0817439390|5.0|As someone coming into a DSLR with zero knowledge this was a great book. It teaches you the foundation of taking great photos in manual mode.  The author is a natural light photographer and focus heavily on capturing natural light for your photographs.  I do wish he went into a little more detail about how to get that light especially for indoor photos and would give a little more information on using and buying flashes.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Typical Clancy.  A great read from beginning to end.  Ryan, Ding, Clark and the rest of the gang are all there, contributing to the action we've grown to expect.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this app all the time to sell and buy. Very user friendly and helpful in managing your seller's account at home and on the go.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|One of the great g5 games and for $2.99 you can't beat it. Long game, fun puzzles worth it 100%  great replay value if you're the kind of person who likes to finish a game on the toughest difficult setting.

B000FC1HBY|4.0|Nice epic story telling.  A bit preoccupied with debauchery though. It makes one happy they are not a peasant....or a lord.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|The first episode is the one that you have to watch to understand the series.  After that you will get hooked.  Each episode is completely different then the last and keeps you coming back for more!
0307730697|5.0|This is a story that will speak to your soul, make you laugh, cry and come out a better person for having known of such a man.  Well told story of struggle redemption and the joy of life--lost tragically too soon.  However much I knew what had to happen, I found myself wishing from the bottom of my heart that it would not.  The humanity of Eric's troubles make his brilliant accomplishments even more impressive.  And you come to feel that you know and admire his warm and beautiful family by the end--such that the pain and poignant loss of the midnight call almost stops your own heart.<br /><br />A truly moving story of family friends and life as well as heroic achievement.  I cannot imagine anyone not being moved by this amazing man, his family and the brotherhood of seals.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I have only played the game once and everytime I try to open it now it force closes and goes back to my home screen. please fix its quite annoying and I love this game.
0525953728|5.0|The courage humility and professionalism that shine through this well told and exciting story are truly inspiring.  This book is well written and clearly a humble portrait of some extraordinary men.  The details of the raid are interesting and the persona of the seal team members even more so.  It is wonderful to see that our country still produces such men of honor, discipline and dedication.  Thank you Mark Owen for this well crafted, first hand account of a historic raid--and for you and your team's protection of our country.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hey ,If your someone who liked Temple Run but instantly got bored, well I know how you feel! This game is addicting fun and never gets old! Its people are cool and its boosts well except Super Sneakers! Its a great app to do when your bored or in the car or looking for something to do. I love it, and you probably will too! I l recommend  this game to everyone!
B008QTVNUI|3.0|Homeland is well written and acted, and is a spy mystery thriller worth a watch. It's not plausible, of course, so be prepared to suspend your disbelief.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it's. awesome I love when pigs make babies I don't. like when mobs kill me I like to shear plugs and make them naked
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great table or ipad game. good way to waste time and a lot of improvement from the first. controls are crisp and the graphics and scenery are great
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|great get it it the best game for free it is so creative that I play it and I play it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story line with lots of twists and turns. Caused many late nights due to being unable to put the book down.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game is fun lots of hours playing with my kids<br />The trains are a little cheesee. The boards are pretty cool.<br />The jetpacks need real flames coming out of them
B00992CF6W|4.0|I<br />I love this game it is my favorite game on the kindle but..is goes crazy when the kindle battery is low but other than  that this, game is great  just keep  battery charged
B001QB5S3G|3.0|I had a specific purpose for watching this movie - an assignment in a class about God and pop culture.  Doing so gave me ability to ask a number of questions about theology, and I understand why a viewing was encouraged. Does a movie need to be 'overtly about God' to be considered 'of Godly value?'  'The Mission' contains extremely graphic and violent scenes, many of which I'd like to assume were not based on historical fact.  Yet, knowing the story was loosely based on the Treaty of Madrid of 1750, I cannot help but wonder how many similar power struggles exist today, in different form?
B00785P2QC|5.0|It was fun get this game ,best game ever better than virtual city 1and2 absolute stunner  please get thank you G5 games

B00942Y94I|5.0|great price, I love amazon instant movies! This was one of the better of the series. 10 bucks for the HD version was perfect
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Temple run 2 is much better then temple run, but for some reason my game circle name won't show, and whenever I try to revive myself, the game crashes.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I read all of the rave reviews and this seemed ok.  Then I ran out of tokens and could not go any further unless I bought tokens.

B000VX6YCO|5.0|I saw these timberlands in Miami last year in Dolphin Mall. I wanted to buy them but they were a bit on the expensive side. I finally got a chance on Amazon and I jumped at it, the fit was exactly what I wanted and the shoes are well made.
1250006341|5.0|I'm a fan of Downton Abbey, so this book is a wonderful companion to my enjoyment of the television series.  I love the beautiful color pictures and the informative text too. I like referencing back to various parts in the book to refresh my memory when I am trying to remember the names and positions of various characters. I bought this book for myself but it would be a wonderful gift for anyone who enjoys this series.
B006PAZMMK|4.0|This is a solid album from Skrillex. The only thing that kept me from giving it that 5th stars is that I thought the overall mix was a little lacking in the mid range. I listened to the songs on several different sets of speakers and headphones and it allows came out harsh on the high end, nice and heavy on the low end, and noticeably lacking in the middle.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I rarely watch movies more than once.  I can't count how many times I've watched this one!  There is something about the chemistry between Drew Barrymore, Dougray Scott, and Angelica Houston that makes this movie irresistible.  Dougray Scott is fantastic as the prince.  I've seen him cast as a villain, most notably Mission Impossible 2.  So I was a bit sceptic about seeing him as the prince.  Goodness was I wrong! He was handsome, charming, and brooding.  I dare say he made me wishing I was Danielle!  Drew Barrymore is one of my perennial favorites and she did not disappoint.  Her portrayal of the Cinderella character was well balanced between a strong, independent woman, and persecuted step sister and step daughter.  The casting of Angelica Houston as the evil stepmother was brilliant, and her portrayal was flawless.
B003RV43X4|4.0|I didn't consider this as an exceptional movie, but I enjoyed sitting down and watching it once.<br />It was easy to watch all the way through.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Great case for protecting Kindle Fire HD.  Fits perfectly and allows you to prop Kindle at a perfect angle for playing games or reading a book.  I slip my stylus onto the elastic strap to hold all together.  Would highly recommend.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The app for Pintrest  was a spur of the moment downloads since it was free!! It was priced right for me to finally go head &amp; create a Pintrest account! Wish they all downloaded &amp; ran smoothly...as it stands I find myself spaced 4 extended periods of time pinning/wishing  pictures for everything I can't afford, lol
0525953590|5.0|Sean Carroll writes an excellent book for non-physicists. My basic physics dates to 1950 yet I was able to gain an understanding  of particle physics. I found the book exciting.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|My son wanted this game bcz kids at school had recommended it.  I checked out the reviews before downloading it and it seemed ok.  Son had it for less than 24 hrs before I started receiving order notifications and charges on my credit card.  He accrued points while playing and thought he was using his points to purchase things during the game.  If Amazon is selling this app to kids there should be a warning for parents that there could be further charges during this game.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Another great work by Riordan.  My favorite part and the most important spoiler free piece I can offer to this book is that Percy Jackson is not the only hero here.  This series has been great at keeping all of the hero's equally important and prominent.<br /><br />My only fault to this installment is that the flow of Roman mythology wasn't as smooth as Riordan had provided to us readers with the Greek mythology, but in fairness he has had 4 books presenting the Greek while this is only his first venture to Roman.<br /><br />Readers will look forward to being presented to the next installment.
B00122OTQ6|5.0|All of these were redone after the '06 concerts, culminating with the DVD. Everything is much more clean and the bass boosted, as all older recordings lacked presence. Soundstage is nice and the material is Duke, top notch, and at the top of their game. If you own the old recording, spend the bucks to get this. Your sound system will love you, or is it the other way around.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|if it would load correctly every time I would love it even more. I love having a horse to play with.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|This is a greatest music CD. They are my most favorite groups and I listen to their music every day. I have almost all of their CDs. They are great!
B005LAIHYU|3.0|This film was released long before the award-lauded LINCOLN (Spielberg), and it's timing couldn't be more perfect. It's silly, exciting and quite well-done, as long as you, the viewer, are willing to put all history aside. I thought it might be a comedy or parody, but director Timur Bekmambetov is determined to have seriousness abound. This film, as displayed, is exciting and fun, and extremely well done, with solid period detail and excellent cinematography by the great Caleb Deschanel.<br /><br />You can pick to pieces the historical mistakes, but why bother? I admire the film as an action film with loads of scares and suspense. Rufus Sewell is, and has always been, the best bad guy ever, and doesn't disappoint here.<br /><br />Abe might've been our greatest president, and this added prowess is only meant to entertain (even though he was in his late 60's while doing those incredible leaps and bounds). Lighten up, folks! Benjamin Walker is solid as Abe, and the whole film, as nothing but entertainment, succeeds.<br />What sets this aside is that it takes itself seriously, and that was a good decision.
B008G59IKO|5.0|This is a great CD. I like all of their most recent CDS, Uno, Tre, they are also great. Thank you.
B008745B32|1.0|Just wasn't my taste in writing, I suppose, but I just couldn't stay interested long enough to keep reading after about a fourth of the book.  So I didn't.  Didn't finish it.
B000IKQMFO|3.0|I had to get this book for a school classs just started it. Can't really say if I really like it yet.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched it on amazon due to missing that show when it aired on PBS. I wanted to stay up on the show.
B004K00NEO|4.0|Yet another movie that is equally enjoyable and entertaining for adults as for kids.<br />Creative screenplay with an intelligent story line. Some of mindless action sequences can be given benefit<br />of doubt to be intended to cater to children amusement.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can't stop playing it is so fun I try to get all coins and I try to beat my old score

B002N5N5LG|5.0|The only reason I bought this was because it was a lightning deal; I'd never seen the show.  I watched the entire series in a day or two and promptly went back for season two.  Quirky, I'm loving it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The first word that comes to mind is \\"different\\".<br /><br />It is entertaining, but has some big holes so far as credibility.  Biggest is how this lawyer of very modest achievement turns into a brilliant schemer who makes complete fools of the FBI.<br /><br />The structure of the book had me searching back repeatedly to see if I had missed something.  I could not understand the animosity against a key figure which is not made clear until late in the book.<br /><br />The Author s Notes reveal his very casual attitude toward this work.<br /><br />Richesnow
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This story is a wonderful depiction of the effects of bullying from all sides of the issue while at the same time staying very interesting. Good for children and adults alike.
B005LAIHCM|2.0|I used to read R.L. Stine's horror books for teens back in the day. I think I devoured each one in a matter of hours. I knew, at the time, that they were cheesy -- rarely did they deviate from the same predictable formula -- but there was something guiltily pleasurable about them. Like the comedian Jim Gaffigan once said, \\"I don't think 'cheesy' is a huge insult. When someone says a movie is cheesy, I always wonder, 'Mmmm. What kind of cheese?'\\"<br /><br />I'm older now, though, and I don't have quite as much time on my hands. My tastes are a little more sophisticated (granted, not by much), and although I still love a little cheese now and then, it should still have a little consistency and flavor. This film -- cheesy galore -- has neither of those things. I was reminded instantly of the R.L. Stine books of my youth, and remembering those old patterns, I figured out the film's big plot twist within the first twenty minutes. This isn't me bragging, either. Anyone who's seen more than a dozen scary movies in their lifetime would be able to guess it. Or anyone who's ever read R.L. Stine.<br /><br />In our story, Elisabeth Shue and her daughter (a girl with the personality of a bowl of milk) move into a house. At the end of the street is the home of a couple that was recently murdered by their own (now missing) daughter. Their college-aged son (a kid who appears to have taken acting lessons from sugar packets) now lives there, morose and grim and brooding. I guess he's supposed to be sexy. Most of the time I just kept marveling at how tiny his mouth was. I bet all he can eat are hotdogs and lollipops.<br /><br />Anyway, the boy (sorry, I didn't bother to learn any of these characters' names) has a BIG SECRET! Before getting to that (or the dozen or so requisite fake scares), the movie labors through uninspired dialogue, stock scenes of a mom and daughter arguing over curfews and dating rules, as well as labored attempts to get our two leads to show anything resembling any kind of chemistry. What's this? Milk Bowl was in a band? Listen to her sing lyrics that sound like they were written by a greeting card author who just downed a pint of Dramamine! Finally, after a few senseless fight scenes (it seems odd that even a surly teenager could -- without provocation -- bash a car with a baseball bat or burn a house down in front of multiple witnesses without expecting to get into trouble for it), the movie limps into the numbingly long third act, where what little shred of credibility it had gets slashed to pieces.<br /><br />There is absolutely no suspense to the film. No thrills or real scares. No interesting dialogue or action. No likable or believable characters at all. No satisfying conclusion. Only a little bit of the acting and some of the cinematography keeps it from being a total waste, but that's not a real good reason to watch the film. It'd take less time and be more enjoyable if you just got a few R.L. Stine books and read them with a flashlight in your basement.any kind of chemistry. What's this? Milk Bowl was in a band?

B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I was a huge fan of the first movie, but I think they keep getting worse and worse the more of them they make.  This one was boring, confusing, and barely had any scary parts.  The ending was just stupid.  I gave it 2 stars because there were a couple of scary parts, but most were already shown in the trailer.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|Although the light itself and its many Colorado options is good, I found it difficult to change floors and use the on /off switch.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Wraps up the story lines found in the last few Pendergast books.  Preston and Child books are always a fun read and Agent Pendergast is a terrific character.  Trying to keep all the back stories straight is a little tough though if you haven't read the previous books in awhile.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you didn't know any better you would have thought the writer was narrating this story from his personal diary. The astounding part was merging all the parts into a cohesive and believable tale and at the same time keep the suspense building. This was a fine job of writing as I have ever experienced. This was a \\"one of\\" I don't think their could ever be sequel, maybe a movie. It reminded me of a Val Kilmer movie (the name escapes me) about Mars where he was rescued in somewhat the same manner. Five stars an incredible read.
B009POCG2C|5.0|If you like movies without a lot of expletives, explicit sex, explosions, then this movie may be for you.  I like it very much because it is a good story with a defined beginning, middle and end.  There are heros, not so nice guys and flawed human beings.  If you are into happy endings, you will love this movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|a must read for every hopeless romantic...i never saw that ending coming! Loved it eager to . see the movie
B000SEIK2S|4.0|The premise is great. When I was a teenager I loved science fiction that included a teenager.<br />Now that I'm in my 70's I love science fiction that includes a old man.
B00992CF6W|1.0|ok both my siblings keep telling me how AWESOME the new update is but I wouldn't know because it cant be updated on the kindle fire!! when we go to our cousins house we all five of us will connect and work on the same world together and we were planning on doing that tonight at their birthday party but now Ill be all alone while the rest of them play. because it doesn't work if we aren't all on the same update!! me= DISAPPOINTED :/
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I chose to read this book before the movie came out. I like to see how the movie follows the book. Sometimes the books are better than the movie
B008RYN44U|4.0|I am not quite sure why anyone would still expect &#34;Tragic Kingdom Part II&#34; from No Doubt given that both &#34; Return of Saturn&#34; and &#34;Rock Steady&#34; revealed that No Doubt pursues eclectic music and they are adamant not to stick with one style. It also sounds like a rather inane idea to record a new album after years of hiatus solely to repeat an old sound. Frankly, I am glad No Doubt did exactly the opposite of what majority seems to demand and came up with an album that mixes new sound while maintains some core No Doubt elements. In this respect, &#34;Push and Shove&#34; is closer to &#34;Rock Steady&#34; than to &#34;Return of Saturn&#34; and &#34; Tragic Kingdom&#34; but still features some components from the latter two. &#34;Settle Down&#34; and the title track &#34;Push and Shove&#34; are full force reggae infused ska punk songs that welcome horns and strong guitars and they may be the only tracks on the album to satiate the ungrounded anticipation of Tragic Kingdom Part II junkies. No surprise that both tracks indeed remain the strongest  songs on the album but not because they are reminiscent of old days but because they offer unexpected fluctuations between genres and tempos. The rest of the album might be less unpredictable in this sense but that does not mean &#34;Push and Shove&#34; stops there. &#34; Looking Hot&#34; is beyond catchy with fun vocals and big sound guitars (it also sounds amazing live). &#34;Undercover&#34; is infectious in terms of lyrics, vocals and the overall feelings of doubt and vulnerability conveyed by Stefani. Most of the songs may not emulate the lyrical prowess of &#34; Return of Saturn&#34; but both &#34;Dreaming The Same Dream&#34; and &#34;Undone&#34; retain the Saturn quality by being relatable, candid and touching. &#34;Gravity&#34; and &#34;Heaven&#34; reside in the boundaries of new wave and confirm that pop can sound better when No Doubt takes charge. Overall, &#34;Push and Shove&#34; is an easy-to-listen album with a good mixture of catchy songs, safe attempts and few unexpected moments. It may not necessarily stand out in No Doubt catalog but it ensures relevancy and creativity of No Doubt.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that I would rate this game 4 1/2 out of 5 stars because it is really fun to play on but it has quite hard missions some of the time. It's epic
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|As a hardcore Tegan and Sara fan, I easily admit that first exposure to Heartthrob might come quite as a shock to the system (as the appropriate coda suggests). However, one should dwell on what's going beneath the surface before jumping to a biased conclusion. Yes, the album is almost devoid of guitars that have always been central to Quin sisters' music and yes, overpowering synthesizers and keys unapologetically invade each track like any other pop tunes these days but the signs of shifting toward a more pop friendly sound have been there since &#34;So Jealous&#34;. And &#34;Heartthrob&#34; is indeed a pop album. That being said, what distinguishes Tegan and Sara's &#34;Heartthrob&#34; from other contemporary pop albums is its genuine-personal-deep lyrics and strong vocals that easily triumphs the music genre and makes you appreciate the concept and execution of the art it entails. In other words, the album does not try to be catchy for the sake of being catchy, it is catchy to serve the emotional ride that the sisters are expressing. That's why &#34;Heartthrob&#34; is not only a powerful pop album but it is also accessible, relatable and heartfelt. Songs like &#34; Goodbye, Goodbye&#34; (You never knew me, never ever saw me like they did) and &#34;I am Not Your Hero&#34; (Sometimes it feels like I am all that they've got, it's so hard to know I'm not what they want) are perfect examples of pop music at its best in a way that both tracks are sanguine indicators of a revitalized genre. &#34;How Come You Don't Want Me&#34; and &#34;I'm All Messed Up&#34; are undoubtedly among the best songs in Tegan and Sara discography with personal lyrics and amazing vocals. And in the midst of all, you find a song that has Tegan and Sara signature all over with bare guitars (&#34;Love They Say&#34;) that reminds you of old days but also complements the album perfectly. Being one of the most consistent bands around, Tegan and Sara  delivers an album that is brave in sound and atthe same time loyal to their lyrical candor they've known for. They show us that accessibility is not necessarily tantamount to mainstream.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great Read as usual everything one expects from demille Recommend all read this one John and Kate wonderful characters John is so New York
B009R5GR1K|4.0|Fascinating information and fun word games.  This app has quickly become my standard end of day and then finish it in the morning reading.  I love the word association puzzle at the end and look forward to playing it every day and getting 100% - okay, most days I get 100% :)<br /><br />I especially like the quick info and leading question which impels me to learn more about the given subject, person, place, you name it.<br /><br />I did purchase the upgrade as the ads would get in the way of content and were annoying.<br /><br />Two little reasons it didn't get 5 stars:  I can't always understand the person saying the word in \\"spelling bee\\" - the speakers on my Kindle Fire HD are fabulous but the sound quality from the app is not.<br /><br />Also, when I enlarge the screen to play the word association game (little buttons for my big fingers) it puts me back at the top of the page and I have to scroll all the way back to the bottom.<br /><br />Still - a great app with lots of information you didn't know you didn't know!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|First all let me state that I believe in God and I am a practicing Catholic.  I could really relate to how this book was written and it really helped answer several questions I had about what happens after death & also why God doesn't manifest himself on Earth (i.e. to prove his existence).  Having read several NDE books, this one gave  very good descriptive detail on the spirit realm and how it would feel to be without your body and to be close to God.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I went through almost all the levels here before I moved on to Flow Free &#34;Bridges&#34; which is even more intriguing.  Simple in concept, intricate in execution.  Love the bright colors - app works really well.  Can't say enough good things.  Great, great game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best game ever legit... but my bro and sister have the armor update on their ipods but on my kindle fire it wont let me update it i tryed uninstalling it then reinstalling it still doesnt work.  can someone tell me how pls
B0067R0APK|1.0|I already owned the free version on my Kindle HD and have had it on my android phone for a year.  I find it very accurate and quite informative.  However, in Amazon's recent sale - I purchased this \\"Premium\\" app thinking I was getting more content.  To me, the promotion implies that there will be the extra screens such as \\"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\\", \\"The Tuscan Sun\\" and \\"The Perfect Storm\\" - I stupidly thought these were going to be part of the premium app and could be configured in some way, which is the only reason I bought it.  Wrong again - this appears to just be an Amazon way of promoting it.  While I am extremely happy with my Fire HD, I think this is a bit of false advertising on Amazon's part.<br /><br />Apparently the only difference between this app and the free one is - wait for it... NOTHING!  The only thing I've gotten for my .99 was a red banner across my sunshine proclaiming \\"Sale!\\" on my app icon.  Whoopee!  Don't bother - stick with the free one.  I've already dumped it and reinstalled the free one.<br /><br />ETA:  Okay- the only thing different is that there are ads (completely out of the way) on the free one.  They don't inhibit your viewing and you can hardly hit them by accident.<br /><br />I've contacted Accuweather customer service per Amazon's advice (they didn't refund me but I didn't beg) but I won't necessarily hold my breath waiting for their answer.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Ordered on 1/30/13 received on 2/1/13. Great service great packaging, great prices. Package was handled with great care and the DVD still had plastic on it like you would find in the store. No dings, dents, scratches or tears in product, packaging, and even came with a receipt that was nicely folded. I had propmt service with a tracking number that was included so I could track its where abouts through the shipping process. I had standard shipping, and I recieved this item in three days. Thats including the day I ordered which was late at night, the next day, and the day I recieved the package. I received the item through USPS. Will definatly recommend them in the future and will buy from them again. Thank you for the happy memories to come and for the great experiance as well. BTW I ordered the Men in Black 3 movie DVD format and I heard this is suppose to be an excellent movie. My friend who hardly goes to the movie theater saw this movie and even recommended it as well. Didn't get to see it but now I have it. So looking forward to watching it. Thank you so Much! They (the company who I bought the movie from) actually deserve 10 stars, but they only allow 5.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Don't bother upgrading - you get no extra content and the ads in this are minimal.  Great app, amazingly accurate.  I have had this on my phone for a year - it's great and very reliable.

READ THIS BOOK AND SEE IF YOU AGREE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Plato asked `what is justice?'  Author and legal theorist Eric Heinz, now asks `what is injustice?'  Most people think they know the difference.  Most lawyers, judges and other main players in the legal system know they know the difference.  However, it's this sense of certitude that Heinz seeks to knock on its head.<br /><br />As Professor of Law and Humanities at Queen Mary College, University of London, Heinz argues in this thought provoking treatise that, contrary to the traditional tenets of Western justice theory, injustice is not primarily the negation, failure or absence of justice.  Rather it is `the constant product of regimes and norms of justice'. Furthermore, justice is not always the cure for injustice, but often its cause.<br /><br />If you don't agree with any of this, don't worry.  According to Heinz, Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel and even Karl Marx wouldn't have either.  It was apparently Plato's friend Thrasymachus -- dubbed `proto-Nietzschean' by Heinz -- who praised what we infer is the superiority of injustice, of which he was convinced, arguing that power or wealth or even happiness can be acquired by clever and daring folk by unjust actions and through the application of force or stealth.<br /><br />Proto-Nietzschean?  You bet!  Small wonder that two and a half millennia later, everybody knows about Plato, but nobody's ever heard of Thrasymachus.  But here we over-simplify and digress.<br /><br />As the author later warns us, Plato's Socrates cannot solve the problem of justice...by erasing Thrasymachus or what he stands for'. Agree or not, it is unarguable that justice and injustice co-exist and will always do so.<br /><br />Which is why, reluctantly one has to admit that some attempt should be made to explain injustice without necessarily condoning it - and that is, in our view, what this book has set out to do.<br /><br />In constructing and supporting his arguments, the author selects and quotes from any number of literary as well as philosophical texts, which range from the Bible to Sophocles, Plato and Aristotle -- and from Augustine and Dante to Thomas Aquinas and Erasmus.  Particular attention is paid to Shakespeare, whose works are more frequently referred to than anybody else's. Others quoted also include Racine, Voltaire, and Rousseau, as well as Kant, Schiller, Jeremy Bentham and Marx and Engels and more besides.<br /><br />A breadth and depth of erudition is offered in this overview of injustice as a concept, as well as close and convincing argument. If you, like most advocates -- whether lawyers, academics, or philosophers -- enjoy building up arguments, or demolishing them, there is much food for thought here in this glossy hardback.<br /><br />If you're doing research in this area of legal theory, you'll be delighted with the extensive footnoting throughout, the massive bibliography and the useful index. This contemporary take on issues as old as time, was published in 2013.y condoning it - and that is, in our view, what this book has set out to do.<br /><br />In constructing and supporting his arguments, the author selects and quotes from any number of literary as well as philosophical texts, which range from the Bible to Sophocles, Plato and Aristotle -- and from Augustine and Dante to Thomas Aquinas and Erasmus.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I must say I got impatient and used hints, then ran out.  I then found navigating to the Quell hints through their site at Facebook almost as challenging as a level in this game.  Basically - go to YouTube and search for Quell.  That's where they are posted by the developers.  Which again, isn't all that easy without another computer, but whatever.  Fascinating game and truly engrossing.  Still love it.  Just wish I could buy hints.

B0083GQKQG|4.0|Every time some deranged individual goes on a mass killing spree, we rightly focus our attention and concern on the victims and the devastated loved ones they leave behind. But who thinks about the impact such events have on the family of the killer?  Well, the makers of \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" certainly have, and the result is both heartbreaking and blood-curdling to witness.<br /><br />This grimly fascinating indie drama focuses on Eva (Tilda Swinton in a bravura performance), the mother of a troubled teen who slaughters a number of his fellow classmates in a high school assembly.  The multi-tiered screenplay by Rory Kinnear and director Lynne Ramsay looks at Eva's life both after the massacre and in the years leading up to it (Kevin is played  by three different actors  at various stages of life).<br /><br />From the beginning, Kevin is clearly a problem child, a \\"bad seed\\" as it were, for lack of a better term (think of Damian sans the supernatural powers and Satanic bloodline).  Perpetually frustrated and exhausted, filled with self-loathing and doubt, Eva spends every waking moment struggling to be a decent mother to her child, but nothing she does or says can break through the emotional barrier the sociopathic Kevin has set up between himself and the world.  Eva is further isolated by the fact that Kevin even has his own father (John C. Reilly) deluded into believing that the problem does indeed lie with Eva, in her weaknesses and inadequacies as a mother - almost to the point where even Eva, at some level, begins to believe it herself.<br /><br />Swinton breaks our hearts every step of the way as she wages a constant, solitary battle against a force she has no hope of ever understanding or controlling - for all the parents around her seem to have no such problems raising their own, much more reasonable and malleable children.  It leads us to the broader question of what happens when that most basic of all human bonds - that between a parent and a child - is irrevocably broken.  And how is a parent to love a child who steadfastly refuses to love her back?<br /><br />And life is certainly no better for Eva after the killings, for now she is forced to live out the rest of her life as a pariah in a community that blames her in large part for the tragic loss it has suffered, a community that has no interest in reaching out to her for understanding or healing. Her fate, then, is to struggle on alone, devoid of sympathy, compassion and any chance at reparation.<br /><br />\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" may be one of the bleakest and most despairing portraits of parenthood and childrearing ever committed to film, but it makes for a haunting and unnerving experience that you will find very hard to shake.- is irrevocably broken.

B00AHSIQWE|3.0|As \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" opens - picking up eight years after the events chronicled in \\"The Dark Knight\\" - we find eccentric billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a rather depressed state of mind.  He has essentially withdrawn from the world, given up his crime-fighting ways and hung up his Batman cape, having largely fallen out of favor with the citizens of Gotham City who see him less as a hero and more as an out-of-control killer.  Only his loyal servant/father-figure, Albert (the venerable Michael Caine), cares enough to give him a swift kick in the rear-end every now and again to try to get him to move on with his life.  All this changes, however, when the fascistic Bane comes to town, a figure so consummate in his villainy that he is willing to blow up the whole blasted metropolis with an atomic bomb if he doesn't get what he wants.<br /><br />Though Christopher Nolan`s latest entry in the series is nowhere near as engaging or as gripping as the previous two (especially the second), the movie attains a certain historical and contemporary significance with its echoes of both the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street, though, oddly, the movie seems intent on putting us on the wrong side of history in both cases (rooting for a corrupt status quo and against a grass-roots uprising against that corruption).<br /><br />And, let's face it, Heath Ledger's Joker - one of the richest villains in all of movie history - would be a hard act for anyone to follow, and Tom Hardy`s Bane, even with his mask and amplified voice, seems a mite tame in comparison.  On his own terms, however, Bane is reasonably effective, if only because of the implacable nature of his evil, which manifests itself in his willingness to sacrifice masses of innocent people to enrich his own power.<br /><br />Thanks partly to the muddled politics and partly to the overstuffed nature of the storytelling, the movie never finds a way to fully engage its audience in the world it's created. In fact, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together. A case in point: while Anne Hathaway brings a degree of flirtatious charm to the role of cat burglar-turned-Cat Woman, the character as a whole seems like an afterthought, tacked onto the story to provide some counter-balancing romantic interludes for the sullen, all but monastic Wayne.<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart and others, but, more so than in the two previous entries in the series, the real stars of \\"The Dark Night Rises\\" turn out to be the visual pyrotechnics and special effects.ct, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together.

B00881VLCE|4.0|I love puzzles, so I love this app. I can set the puzzle at hard for myself and easy for my 6 year old. If I had written this a couple weeks ago, I would've given it 5 stars, but since my app update I've been a little disappointed. I just thought there was something wrong with it because I couldn't get any of the pieces to fit together. Then I realized that you can't put them together unless they are in the right direction to fit in the finished puzzle. What's the point in a rotate option when you can't rotate a group of pieces. I'll still play though but mat be on the lookout for a new app.

Some reviews claimed it was disjointed. So did BOB but WAR is disjointed. I liked that it was NOT exactly like BOB.Even the non war parts are GREAT. Waiting for the next set about the air war. A MUST for historic war movie fans.I can't believe how many bad reviews I've read here, I bet most of these guys really liked Saving Private Ryan that was mostly FICTION. what's up with that?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game when ever i can i have even sometimes play in school!  My friends are always saying who awesome it is.  I think it is way better than temple run!:);)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Life is filled with love and hate. This novel reminds me that God may close a door but he will surely open a window. He has a plan for everyone.<br /><br />My favorite quote from the book is: \\"The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller.\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My friend got this application and said that he likes it a lot, but it didn't look very good. Then I downloaded it and it was the best game ever since halo! GET IT!
B006T5C5PS|5.0|If you care about your health and want to avoid having to go to a Gerson Clinic read this book. Although a bit repetetive in places the information in the book is essential information for those desire good, wholesome food and nutrition information. Even if you don't have cancer this book may help you learn how to prevent cancer!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games in the world. It is so fun!!!!!!! I love how there world tour keeps changing places and I love how their are special characters
B0091REZMW|5.0|Good and entertaining makes the search for items FUN and unpredictable having very little to compare to other games<br />Fin
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a really addicting game sometimes i will play it for two hours. Although it may be addicting it's a really fun game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hour of great fun and challenges every time I come back a must have<br /> I have made this game a battle between my sisters and me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun how you can challenge your friends high scores with facebook,overall great game well done with this outstanding app
B004J64QR4|5.0|I love Colm, but honestly nothing beats Aflie Boe!  This is the perfect soundtrack album.  Only thing better is the PBS video.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you like the first temple run you will like this one even more. It is basically the same as the first one with some change, but the big thing is that the graphics are so much better. When you are running instead of going in a straight line the track curves. You can also level up by doing the objectives. The only thing they should Change is tell you step by step on how to do the objectives beside I am stuck on one.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Better than expected. Tommy Lee Jones is always good.  His younger counterpart is also quite good.<br /><br />Good light entertainment.  Add it to your list.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers! It's really fun!also my whole entire family love it. When my cousin use to love temple run but when she saw me plat subway surfers then she said, \\"oh can I play\\". When she played this game then she said that its colorful and cooler.
0062060554|2.0|A great beginning but had to put it down because of the repetitiousness.  I really look forward to a good read but was disappointed.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Have  read previous history by this author and loved them.  Would recommend this book to all who enjoy a riveting read.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Stumbled across this online and thought it might be interesting. We were quite entertained and enjoyed the songs. Hoping the rumors of a sequel are true.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is an awesome game but they could make the characters less expensive and have more upgrades.<br />Overall, it's a pretty good game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Fast interesting read.  The writing from both character's point of view made a cativating senario. Psychological analyses are in depth.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love ea but this beats Sims the free play a little bite mojang  only add all of the stuff from the cumputer
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great to have a game to play on the go.  Layout is great. The squares are easy to hit and the colors are fantastic.
B00AW0KHMY|2.0|Unfortunately, I agree with all the other reviews so far. Usually, if scenes are cut from a movie, it's for a reason. Why do I need to buy another disc just for 8 extra minutes of footage? By the way, if you head over to Walmart.com, you can pre-order a Breaking Dawn Part 1 Extended Edition/Breaking Dawn Part 2 Blu-ray or DVD in one package for less than $27. That's probably your best bet if you really want the extra 8 minutes of film. Otherwise, skip this and keep your regular copy.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I liked it so much I also like how they've made it so they use places like New York and Rio it is just so fun my favorite part about it is all the different people in it<br /><br />Carsonmon
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Like everyone else, this version is even better than the first and just as addictive. I find it a little buggy though, as it sometimes thinks I'm trying to swipe the Kindle menu open, or crashing when I least want it to. Yeah, I know I'm whining when I write I lost two gems this way :) Don't miss out and be prepared to spend hours on this game.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Best Trilogy movies of recent 10 years hands down. What could be better than having 3 great movies at one low pirce?
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Love his singing, his music,lyrics of songs and it even calms me. THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE IS THAT THE CD CASE CAME BROKEN!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is a great game for anyone who likes chess.  You can adjust the difficulty to your desired level of play.  I cannot think of a single way this game could be any better.  Loved it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|again I love his singing and lyrics of songs, just beautiful,is like an Angel singing, sometimes I put it on at night and it helps
B007PTJOV0|3.0|well when I got this game I thought it was going to be like Mario brow but it was not......every thing is lame but fun. loo and what's with all the snail's they should be humans or something
B005K2YZ5E|5.0|first it was used and it made be nervouse but it looks like new i was amazed.  second it fits the kindle and keeps it safe- just what i wanted.
B000VIPJKM|4.0|Funny and light hearted!! I love Reese and I think she did a great job! It's great for a family with older kids.<br />I think there is  a lot of unnecessary cuss words which would limit families with younger kids to watch.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It wakes me up in the morning to a ringtone or an mp3.  I can depend on it so I like it.  It turns my Kindle Fire into an alarm clock with a back up battery built in.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the minecraft pe it is so awesome wait till the new update 0.6.0<br />you can build lots of awesome stuff

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this app. its cool, has good graphics, and its just like taking care of a real horse. also, if you're willing to spend some money to get gems, you can get a unicorn or a zebra.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you play this  you will get addicted, very easily so be careful but it is very fun. I love to go get new charters, and the game and survive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|just started playing this yesterday and so far I like it. I have nothing bad to say about it so far. I just wish u could get more gems when you level up
B006LSZECO|1.0|First half was fantastic. Second half lost direction totally and became really outrageous. I am mad I spent money on this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app has 2 great reasons to play. To survive or to just build for fun. I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I have never played a game that I liked so much that I refuse to get off. Unlike other games this one never freezes and makes you restart I love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is amazing... i love all of the additions. will totaly recommend this to people, i already have! they love it too.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun little game to play around with. The only thing I don't like is that you have to buy more jewels to get the really cool stuff, which I won't do..
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is great. Except for 1 thing... i was only able to play it for 10 minutes until it crashed. I have an Android Velocity Micro Cruz T408 Tablet and it got uninstalled. Everytime I try to reinstall it, it says it was not installed. Can anyone help me fix it? Thank you.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Great to have Rebus back. Have always enjoyed Ian Rankins writings. What more can you say if you have been reading all of the Rebus saga.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book Really makes you appreciate our troops.  Thank you for a fantastic book.  A  must must read in my opinion.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's novels & this one does not disappoint. I love how it flashes back to 1940's war time London & to the present. Another great read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has awesome graphics and I think that they really outdid themselves with all the new traps they had and the huge demon monkey.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I needed this for my 2008 Infiniti G37 coupe in order for the iPhone 4S to charge properly.  This worked as advertised for me.  Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever double coins price is to high there is an nice varietey of characters I love the game buy it
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm 13, and quite frankly, I'm addicted to Pinterest and obsessed with One Direction. I have over 2500 pins and don't regret it at all! The app runs very smoothly, with pinning at a simple few touches. I don't know what more you could want or ask for. I love it. I'd give it 6/5 stars!
B002MG2ATY|1.0|Take a subject that has been exhaustively examined numerous times. Add wild speculations. Do crude re-constuctions. Shoot everything out of focus, with endless jerks of the camera, and constant flashbacks. And you get this worthless movie.
B006L9B6TI|3.0|Great as the other books of Rhonda, the 28 fays formula is something that help to acomplish your goals! easy reading
B0092SPYQG|5.0|This is definitely a papa roach album, yet it's a lot different than other stuff... Very creative music and as always, Jacobi is the best!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Fabulous book. I always like the bad boys. He'll I married one, so these books hit right at home for me.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo7SHZ6NXGULU3]]Loved, loved, loved this movie. So much to take away from it that is applicable in everyday life.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I found this \\"101 ways to survive on Mars\\" book to be a nice easy holiday read as well as the source of a few chuckles.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Mr.  Follett must have heard that sex sells because this novel is a lot more loaded with sex scenes than his other novels.  That would be OK if he hadn't stereotyped the different nationalities in this book.  Certainly not his best work.  I don't think I'll buy the sequel(s) or maybe not even any more of his books.  This novel has the same level of quality of stuff you can get for free on Amazon.  I cannot recommend this book.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|would not open so I deleted it so I could install it again but it wont go away and I click on it. it says it was deleted but it tells me I still have it so know I cant even install it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is well scripted, the costumes are historically accurate with great attention to detail. My only disappointment is how they skip such large periods of time.
B004L49K20|5.0|Truly a wonderful surprise this record.Extremely inspired from first to last note, \\"All you need...\\" brings a Duran Duran youthful and renewed with fresh teen, as in the early 80s.Virtually all the songs are worthy of entering a greatest hits. This disc is as good as the first (1981) and Rio (1982). Congratulations, guys, you suceeded amazed everyone! Long live Duran Duran.Greeting from Brazil, your second home.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Not the best movie with Meryl Streep, but still quite enjoyable. Good for a relaxing evening at home. . .
B003L77G6A|5.0|We cant get enough of the Big Band Theory! This is the only show since Friends that we can watch over and over and still find hilarious. Even my son loves this show.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Thought provoking on several levels.  Very likable characters.  Leave you with an aawwhh and a smile.  Definately would recommend this.
B003L77G06|4.0|Modern Family is a great family show. Hilarious characters and script. We bought this as a gift for my in-laws, and they enjoy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a good game teaching responsibility to kids of all ages even adults and u should get this game its great
B00A8ECU24|3.0|We downloaded this for my daughter, and it's way too difficult. This game must be made for older girls - around 10 yo. Do 10 yo's still watch My Little Pony?
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Fantastic and easy to use.  Certainly helped me create an e-book ready for publication and filled in the blanks that I didn't understand.  I still use it as a great reference.
B002JVWQSW|4.0|Modern Family will be one of the classics. It's good for all ages. Our in-laws enjoy this (it was their xmas gift).
B004SUWR2C|4.0|DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. THEY HAVE MESSED THIS GAME UP! THE  ORIGINAL UNO WAS A BEAUTIFUL GAME AND I HAD A LOT OF FUN PLAYING THE ORIGINAL GAME. THIS GAME HAS PLAYERS EXCHANGING HANDSG  JUMPING IN WHEN IT IS NOT YOUR TURN, AND REALLY PLAYING THE GAME THAT THEY WANTED YOU TO PLAY AND NOT THE GAME THAT YOU WANTED TO PLAY. THIS IS A BUYERS BEWARE PRODUCT
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is WAY better than temple run and temple run 2. in this app, they have an update like every month and its world tours. it has been New York lately and right now its Rio. this app is the most amazing app ever!
B0019IB0II|5.0|The author does a great job of explaining the anatomy and neuroscience of the brain.  It was interesting to be reading an entertaining narrative of her experience, and yet learning at the same time.  Well written book.  And she explores the potential for a right-brain paradise in all of us.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Initially I read the first page and then stopped after reading the disclamer about the content(I wasn't sure if I was up to such a deep read) Am I ever glad I went back to it. From the start this Author grabbed me . It didn't matter that the lead character was 17.The story was so captivating ; and then oh my god as the story unfolded my heart went out to all the characters involved in this mans unthinkable deeds. This is a must read and must tell story!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven had both suspense and spirituality...I would recommend this book to other Nicholas Sparks fans, Nora Roberts fans or Danielle Steele fans.<br />I liked both main characters a lot.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Good times at Hotel Transylvania all around. Good story line drives the action. We enjoyed it immensely. You will too!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The Racketeer was a little unbelievable that the main character Bannister could get away with as much as he did.  Nothing ever seemed to go wrong.  I did like the storyline though.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This was just what I was needing and the price was great! This was an excellent transaction! Highly recommended! Awesome!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book showed so much of how so many people feel not ready for love but when you less except it its right there in your face.
B00005JSGU|2.0|Found out it works on a different dvd regional setting. Order and shipping was complete and well received. However the settings don't work on my end. Thanks. :/
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Best game ever play this game every day it's fun<br />Lot of fun never want to stop playing awesome  game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app for horse lovers.  Progress quickly through initial levels, a variety of tasks and games to complete, and can do tasks simultaneously.
B001375PI6|5.0|Graham Greene is quoted on the cover as saying that this is \\"the best spy novel I ever read.\\"  Le Carre also listed this as his favorite work, which was his third novel and which made his reputation.  It is an excellent piece of work. Depending on how broadly you define the field of \\"spy novel\\", it's the best there is.<br /><br />Le Carre worked for British intelligence in the 1950s and understands the gritty realities of the field.  There is none of the glamor or action hero stunts of Ian Fleming's novels.  Rather, Le Carre understood the spy as part of a bureaucracy, suffering from the same career frustrations and internal politics that plague any office worker.  The danger is there -- not in the form of thugs chasing James Bond through Berlin, but in being exposed and liquidated.  Le Carre does a good job of conveying this fear.  So it's not the escapist fiction of a Bond thriller; rather, it's a more conventional novel about characters to whom we can relate.<br /><br />The characters are not especially well developed, though the love story at the heart of the book is believable, and the two lovers are very likeable.  The twists of the plot and the moral ambiguities of the Cold War are what this book is about.<br /><br />To those of us steeped in the \\"evil empire\\" theory of Soviet Communism and the disgrace with which it collapsed in 1991, it's difficult to appreciate the appeal of communist ideology to post-war Europeans.  We now tend to see the Cold War as a battle between pure evil and pure good.  But that was not the case.  In a critical scene, the East German interrogator asks the British spy what he believes in -- and the spy can't really answer the question.  The Communists as least had an ideology -- and an idelogy whose professed goals, at least (if not its actual performance) were admirable and inspiring.  The appeal of this ideology gave the East its power and credibility -- and it made the Cold War a true battle for the soul, not just a good vs. evilfable.  In addition, the methods employed by the East and West spies were so similar and cynical, that the moral lines between the two camps blurred.<br /><br />In the end, Le Carre's moral lesson appears to be that to come in from the cold of the postwar world requires a rather frank assessment of the moral limitations of both camps.  And it requires us to value more personal human virtues, such as the love between the two characters at the heart of the novel (and such as the image of innocent children which Le Carre also movingly invokes).<br /><br />A very gripping and satisfying novel.
B001MSMULG|5.0|I, being contrary, have found myself reading the Gabriel Allon series somewhat backwards. The Kill Artist is one of the earlier books in the Allon series, and serves as a clear introduction to the artist-assassin. While the love life of Allon in this book is not as enchanting as that in some of the others (his love for Chiara, for example), the interplay of the assassin-with-a-conscience and the young boy Peel was touching.  This book also took a carefully interesting look at both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Particularly enjoyable was the play between the irascible Shamron and Yasser Arafat (in a clever role).  Highly recommended - as always, the entire series is!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I can't express exactly how much I love this movie.  If you need a laugh and like things that are a little wrong, then you must watch this movie!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]this game is something to try out when you have time to kill!  graphics are great and the gaming experience is amazing!!  addicting!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show has so much to offer.  Great story line, terrific cast of actors, and the dry humor of Maggie Smith.  If you're not watching Downton Abbey, you're missing out!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|All 3 Bourne movies are fantastic, but even better on Blu-Ray. Would definitely recommend this set to others - it's wonderful.
B005R32L66|1.0|I have the new galaxy and I cant even use video chat at all. totally sucks my mom lives 1000 miles from me and I cant even video chat with her. what a waste.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Well, for a family of Star Wars junkies, seeing all of the movies on Blu-Ray was a real treat! This is an excellent set - we liked all the changes that Mr. Lucas made. Fantastic!
B000002G30|4.0|I bought this cd for my boyfriend. He likes the CD a lot and it arrived quickly to my house and without scratch or any other issues. Would definitely recommend.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Purchased this for my son for Christmas - now we have a new Python fan in our midst. Excellent film - wonderful to find it on DVD!
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  The puzzles are great some are harder than others but enough to make it interesting.  Great app for a math geek.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The only bad thing is I could play this all day!! So addictive. I love this game and it was free!
B009MO5960|5.0|THIS WAS THE BEST OF THE SERIES SO FAR AND I HOPE THEY CONTINUE TO MAKE MORE OF THIS SERIES.  HAD ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer it's fun and cool I will never forget the look on Shannon 's face when she saw the game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 5year old son downloaded the game and my husband loved it so much he downloaded it onto his phone too. Very addicting and fun!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is like the coolest game I've ever played I've never played anything like it its cool because it has a save me
B004UID2LC|1.0|Was reported as malicious on my Kindle fire. Instantly uninstalled app. Maybe just my system but not taking any chances.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I feel like Greg heffley needs a lot of help about middle school (definitely not from Roderick) big big time
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed and was inspired by the book, but the age of the characters didn't agree, in my mind, with their wisdom and philosophies on death and dying.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Greg's plan for summer didn't quite work out so he tried to do something different it worked out a little bit
1593272774|4.0|A gift for my boys.  It is something that I think they'll use more and more as time goes by.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Almost as good as the Oxford American dictionary plentiful words to lead to  unimaginable places you will never get enough knowledge
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm going to show you me on sub way surfers and temple run two showing people skills and experience to the world
B003ODIZL6|5.0|One of the most helpful book s i have ever seen it has almost every definition imaginable you will love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great game and I love competing against my friends to see who can get the best score
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I almost gave up on this book---something that I don't do often. The first quarter of the book was interesting and engaging. It has a unique magical system and a promising premise. Unfortunately, the middle half of the book drags, and it started to feel like Sanderson was just inserting events to increase the page count. In addition,there are multiple occurences that seem preordained from the beginning of the book, and, as a result, it seems like the author is just endlessly vamping to delay obvious plot developments.<br /><br />The good news is that the last quarter of the book (after is seems like everything has reached a resolution) really comes to life and reveals that many things from the middle of the story are not exactly as they seemed. In addition, the writing in the end section is much sharper, probably because Sanderson is no longer constrained by the obfuscation that was necessary in the middle section.<br /><br />For the price, this is bargain. And I'm looking forward to reading the next two volumes. Just stick with it when it seems to be dragging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun game when you play so much you don't even realise how much money you've earned subway surfers is a terrific game
B009KHCT94|3.0|While \\"Iron Sky\\" is certainly a much better movie than [[ASIN:B007X6NPE2 Nazis at the Center of the Earth]], it is only partially successful as a truly watchable \\"Grade B\\" Sci-Fi.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The movie opens with the USA's less than triumphant return to the moon as part of campaign stunt for a \\"Sarah Palin\\" type president trying to get reelected for a second term. The Astronaut she chose to the lead the mission to the Dark Side of the Moon is a black model, with the mission motto, \\"Black to the Moon... Yes we can.\\" Imagine the surprise when they find a moon base populated by... Nazis! Form there we are treated to fairly decent acting, special effects ranging from laughable to actually very good, a strong anti-American message (unnecessarily offensive in a few places), awkward race stereotyping, and some pretty good spoofing of Sci-Fi/Film classics.<br /><br />It did take me three attempts to get all the way through the movie so it was far from riveting, but it did have a few worthwhile scenes for the \\"bad movie\\" lover to enjoy.<br /><br />CFH
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game and how it travels around the world. And it also takes u to the where it is.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The gradual volume alarm is perfect and I love that it tells you how many hours it is until you're alarm will go off almost as a confirmation. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game I have ever played and if you like temple run then you will like subway surfers!!!!!!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I had a blast with this game. The music, story and graphics were all awesome. The puzzles were very fun and I love to be able to wander around to find items. I can not wait for the next part of the story. I usually get ticked off when story lines are to be continued but this one was not so bad. It really did not leave you hanging like some do. Please make more games like this. In fact it would be nice if all of your games were available for android devices. There are a couple that my son can get for his ipod that I am unable to get. Thanks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From the first paragraph I was hooked...I became so embedded in the lives of Sky and Holder. This is true love at it's finest. The emotions that they both felt were do real. Bless they're hearts !!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a way better version of Temple Run! If you love fun games you will love Subway Surfers! Take my word on it

B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed book one, and this book was even better. Looking forward to reading book three. Once you start reading it's hard to put down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|First rate story. First rate producing. First rate actors. I am not a TV fan at all but this one held my attention from beginning to end. How come the Brits walk circles around Hollyweird yet again?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Always love his books and this one did not disappoint. I would recommend all of his books including this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Over word to describe this game is ADDICTING! Why wouldn't you play this game? I kinda like this game better than temple run 2.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The lst few chapters did not keep my interest.  The ending was a surprise but I didn't like it.  I have mixed feelings about the story: I kind of like it but at the same time it is not one of my favorite books.
