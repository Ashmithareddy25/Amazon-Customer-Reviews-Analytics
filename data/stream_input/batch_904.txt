B000OW8DW6|5.0|Great political thriller, with a minor sci-fi presumption thrown in - people can't reproduce anymore. Towards the end there is a superb street level combat scene.
B00005MP58|5.0|Good version of this classic with extensive family scenes, not hurried, telling more of the story than other versions, especially the Greer Garson version.  I liked the Kiera Knightly one, but it left out a lot to fit story into a theater length movie. Having said that I like having this on dvd so can I watch it in parts due to the length. I think the acting is fantastic, I can understand what's being said and the subtle nuances behind the words spoken.  The actors did a great job in conveying emotions and treating the words of this classic story so carefully.  Music, costuming, scenery, were great too.  Other versions seem so hurried; this is more relaxing to watch.
6303942830|5.0|I bought this very inexpensive VHS because I am a teacher. One of my students lost the school's VHS movie after I checked the library's copy out. I got a notice to return the movie or pay $25. OH HECK NO! I got this movie for little 'o' nuttin' from Amazon (or whoever), took it to the librarian and she just put her numbers on it and I was off the hook. Its a good movie.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|A true classic!   And the picture is so crisp on Blu-Ray!  Very highly recommended!
1572816112|4.0|The second I laid eyes on this deck, I knew I had to have it. The illustrations on the cover were so beautiful and just simply different than what I'd been used to seeing. I'm always happy to see someone deviate from the Rider-Waite symbolism, and this deck certainly has no compunction in doing so. Death is represented by a pregrant woman with a horses skull for a head, holding back an infant from trying to reenter the womb with her foot. It's striking.<br /><br />Though I've no regrets in my purchase from a purely artistic standpoint, there are a few cards that I feel are unfaithful to their original interpretations, sacrificing meaning for surreal expression. Strength is portrayed as a man wrestling with an alligator, with seems incongruous with the card's traditional interpretation of passive, inner strength and compassion. Seven of swords is a harlequin lad balancing a sword above his mouth by a frayed rope, which is certainly in line with the message of irresponsibility, but lends nothing to it's stronger meaning of dishonor and theft. Nine of Pentacles is represented by an armless, hooded female figure who's chained a little flying skull figure to herself, against a backdrop of nine pentacles in the sky. I have difficulty seeing her as a independent, refined ideal the card traditionally represents (although she may be a reference to the RW hooded falcon). You do occassionally get the feeling the artist had a cool idea and wanted to put it on a card, regardless of whether or not it truly fit.<br /><br />The misses, however, are few, and I'm greatly enjoying the deck. Having to stretch my ideas of what the card represents doesn't greatly hinder my reading of them, and they are absolutely stunning. If nothing else, pick them up just to look at them. They're unlike any other tarot deck out there.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Great movie full of action and romance.  A great combination.  Lots of extras on the dvd's.  Highly recommended!
B000683VI4|5.0|Excellent - my DVD was delivered on time and in excellent shape. Thanks so much!
6305364648|5.0|This movie is kind of old.  I like watching it again sometimes.  Nice to have in the library.  Great action scenes!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Excellent condition and service - delivered on time, and was very happy with product -  just like Brand New!!!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|A fantastic movie, touching and appealing in so many ways. One of the best I have seen in a while, and its another example of Eastwoods amazing talent both in front of and behind the camera. I have to say he is in many ways among the greatest ever in Hollywood.
B0028K31CE|5.0|Maxwell has managed to grow, even change his sound a bit, and still put out a very good, very relevant piece of work. This record is less ambient, and more gritty. Same heart felt lyrics, same sultry soul, same intricately, gripping beats (just a little more organic/less produced, and \\"traditionally musical\\"). And the addition of the (making of) DVD just takes this purchase over the top. To watch why & how someone does something, and then hear the end result is brilliantly enlightening, and adds a layer to the musical process that more artists/labels should explore. This was a very gutsy, and gratifying project by Maxwell, and a very worthwhile addition to my now complete Maxwell catalog. Get the BLACKsummers'night CD/DVD Deluxe Edition at: [...]

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I actually know someone who has read all of Elizabeth Gaskell's novels.  Apparently Gaskell was a 19th century social reformer who saw her work more as advancing the causes of the poor working man and the formation of unions for same.  So she may well be turning in her grave if she were to discover the legions of females panting over Richard Armitage, who plays the male lead character, cotton weaving mill factory owner Thornton.  However, Armitage has not provoked this reaction in me with his star turns in VICAR OF DIBLEY or SPOOKS (called MI-5 in the USA).  So Gaskell must have put a very solid love story to sell what otherwise would have been a very hard to sell novel.  To further demonstrate exactly how good this was, I was flat on my back in the hospital recovering from surgery when I watched this on a dvd player.  I loved it despite all the other hospital activity going on around me, including being poked and prodded.<br /><br />As I've previously stated, I don't think the make or break factors in romance works are the heroines.  I think it is the hero. Thus, Armitage's brooding, smoldering performance as Thornton I think will rank with Colin Firth's playing Darcy in \\"Pride & Prejudice\\".<br /><br />The reason for the title is that the heroine moves from the south of England, which was still quite bucolic, to the much harsher north.  The north is newly industrialized and all the focus is on profits to be made in factories with little thought towards the welfare of the working man.  The heroine is a preacher's daughter and finds most of this treatment inhumane.  She is rather newly poor herself as her father had a falling out over church dogma so has foisted this move upon them.  However, she has a very rich godfather who looks after her and is estate planning with her in mind.  This will lead to some very surprising twists in the tale.<br /><br />The director incorporates many artistic flourishes throughout in the filming.  There is one beautiful scene where the cotton in the mill is floating through the air as if it were snow and for a moment you think it is winter but it is not.  The ending is filmed in summertime at a railroad station where the two leads are on trains going in opposite directions, one north and one south.  They both briefly get off the train and run into one another.  The filming of this sequence is absolutely lovely.  (The reader of the Gaskell novels told me this scene does not exist in the novel.)<br /><br />The key roles, all beautifully acted, are the male and female leads, the mother of the male lead, the father of the female lead and the union organizer who deals with both of the leads.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0670020478|1.0|Some of these reviewers must be disingenuous. This is not the book that is suggested on the back cover. I am very interested in creativity and work in a creative field, so naturally I was drawn to this book. But as some others have noted, this is nothing more than a collection of abbreviated bios of the rich and famous and contains hardly a word about being more creative in our own work, or how to find this apparently illusive \\"element\\". One star because it was not what it purported to be and that is fraud (but a creative way to sell a book, no doubt).
B00005LC1H|5.0|Timing is everything in comedy and no one seems to understand that better than John Cleese playing Basil Fawlty, who runs with his wife perhaps the worst Inn in the British Isles.  Everyone else is the straight man to Cleese in this uproarious series.  If Basil Fawlty thinks you are an English lord staying in his Inn, he is all boot licking, fawning obnoxiousness personified.  He literally falls all over the lord as he is a genius at taking a pratfall.  If he thinks you are a lower class nobody muscling in on his Inn, he is totally obnoxious as the worst sort of English snob, nose in the air. He does his best to ignore you and if you can't be ignored, he delivers devastating put downs, one-liners which are classics in the genre.  You are just as likely to find Fawlty pawing through some guest's room (and about to be caught) as you are to find him skulking in the office trying to avoid front desk duties or making mayhem in the dining room, usually trying to favor one diner over another with his snobbish judgments.<br /><br />Prunella Scales delivers the voice of reason, his wife, flawlessly.  Manuel, the barely English speaking bellhop is a bit reminiscent of Roberto Benigni in his most comic roles.  Polly the maid is a co-writer with Cleese of the show. She is so convincing as a maid that it is hard to believe she is a brilliant writer in real life.<br /><br />But Cleese is the star all the way and I've always been sad there were only 12 episodes.  The classic British idea of a series is always much shorter than the American idea of a series on tv.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

1593081529|5.0|Emma is a young woman from a little town not far from London, but isolated and unfrequently visited. Her mother has died and she lives with her father and her governess. Her family is at the very top of social standings in town, and Emma is all too aware of it. The starting point is her governess's engagement to a good man, which Emma imagines she has engineered by herself. Consequently, she thinks she is the ideal matchmaker, and makes this \\"skill\\" her vocation, which creates all sorts of intrigues, equivocations, and comical situations for all the unfortunate people who surround her, especailly her young and poor protege, Harriet, whom she corners into rejecting a decent fellow in order to get her someone \\"better\\", someone she will be able to receive at her home. So, Emma becomes trouble, and the initial success is hard to repeat. Emma proclaims that she will never marry, as her role in life is only getting other people to marry, besides the fact that she must take care of her old father. Who, by the way, is an unsympathetic, hypocondriac, complaining, and blackmailing man, who has utterly spoiled Emma. Her elder sister, by contrast, is married to a rich banker and lives in London. The rest of the characters is also very well rounded, especially the family friend Mr. Knightley, who is always lecturing Emma about her meddlesome habits; Mrs. and Miss Bates, a couple of neighbors who are poor but close to the family (Miss Bates speaks constantly and erratically, which makes many people avoid her), and the unlikable Elton and Frank Churchill, who Emma believes is in love with her.    The book is funny and written with the mastery of Austen, who manages as always to create a closed world, bounded by very strict rules of conduct and prejudice, in an ecnhanting setting. Emma is definitely a spoiled brat, kind but arrogant, and her delusion about matchmaking unbearable, but nevertheless she is an attractive character, and her youth makes the reader forgive her faults.
1584282584|5.0|This is not the type of book that you buy just to skim it and then put it on a shelf as a reference someday. This is the kind of book that you read from cover to cover and commit everything to memory. Nothing he teaches is unique or earth shattering and that's the beauty of it. His lessons are simple and obvious and yet so extremely important to making photographs look natural with such an unnatural light as an on-camera flash. Neil has a very down to earth writing style and plenty of redundancy and examples to prove his points so that they stick. If you only buy one book this year to improve your photography, this book will be the most bang for your buck!
B002CAWNEM|5.0|This is not a groundbreaking film & when tackling a genre that was so masterfully done with style and elegant grace in Unfaithful and Fatal Attraction - you really have to bring your GAME in order to make any erotic suspenseful thriller, well, an erotic suspenseful thriller!<br /><br />OBSESSED, is a great fun enjoyable movie. However, the lack of an R rating really hinders it from becoming spectacular. The movie has its slow low points, but overall, it was an effective thriller with some titillating tension between the actors and actresses. Of course, Ali Later steals the film. One minute without her crazy antics on screen just feels like a life time. The director made an excellent executive decision by keeping Beyonce's screen time to a minimum. The girl has always had and will always have way too much country swagger and after all this time in Hollywood, she has yet to drop it. It's like the winner of Americas Next Top Model not being able to drop the accent in order to do an effective CoverGirl commercial. When Beyonce utters the line: That gurl mayba alotta thangs, but she aint plain - Just makes me want to cringe. There is a comma in that sentence. Please, pause Beyonce. This is a movie, not a song your singing or a track on your CD where you are trying to carry a tune. Someone please get her an acting coach!<br /><br />I'll give a quick recap of the store, but will not go into full detail, as everyone else's review already has. Derek and Beyonce are a happily married couple that just moved into their new house. On his way to work he bumps into, Lisa, on the elevator and thinks that she's a model. However, she is actually the new temp in the office & it just so happens to be the same office as Derek's. Slowly but surely, she weasels her way to the assistant's desk outside his office & listens in on his calls, goes through his music collection, doesn't give him messages from his wife's missed calls, and so forth. Pretty much the madness ensues since her arrival. I have to hand it to Ali who really deserves an award because she plays crazy Lisa to a tee! Of course, all the girls and gays went crazy for the final showdown scene between the two GURLS! Everyone loves a cat fight & that was one of the major highlights of the movie. Except, it was ruined by Beyonce being ridiculous and insisting the scene be done with her wearing high heels!<br /><br />Overall, this is a great thriller! I know the reviewers have been trashing this movie left and right. I don't understand what their problem is. I guess they were all looking for the next Fatal Attraction. If that's the case, this isn't it. But if you like silly over the top fun in the vein of ShowGirls, then this is the movie for you. Salut!it to Ali who really deserves an award because she plays crazy Lisa to a tee! Of course, all the girls and gays went crazy for the final showdown scene between the two GURLS! Everyone loves a cat fight & that was one of the major highlights of the movie. Except, it was ruined by Beyonce being ridiculous and insisting the scene be done with her wearing high heels!    Overall, this is a great thriller! I know the reviewers have been trashing this movie left and right. I don't understand what their problem is. I guess they were all looking for the next Fatal Attraction. If that's the case, this isn't it. But if you like silly over the top fun in the vein of ShowGirls, then this is the movie for you. Salut!
B001I8ETFA|5.0|This must be a new printing or a new cover or something because there have got to be hundreds of FIVE STAR reviews of this great work. There is an exotic pace to this story as the author moves through three interwoven storylines. This has been on my ten most memorable list since the first time I encountered it.
B0011V7P0A|4.0|Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers have had many classic songs since the beginning. This greatest hits collection is good but not essential. All-American Girl, Free Fallin', Learning To Fly, Don't Come Around Here No More, Last Dance with Mary Jane, and Stop Dragging My Heart Around (duet with Stevie Nicks) are the standouts on this collection. There are some songs that are missing but on the other hand Tom Petty is a wonderful musician so you can't really go wrong by picking this album up, enjoy!

B000UAE7RW|5.0|Chinatown is hands down one of my favorite movies. Acting, directing, screenplay, everything comes together here. I pretty much love everything with Jack Nicholson but this one particularly struck me. Made in his younger days. The part was written for him. I love film noir, and this to me is a great example. Perhaps even people who might be turned off by older movies could start with this modern noir film as an introduction to the style, and hopefully come back for more.   I am not familiar with other editions of Chinatown but this one seems great, and I found the featurettes very interesting.  Took advantage of amazon prime trial offer and the shipment came ridiculously fast. I am very pleased with the entire experience.
0316044695|5.0|This is a short review. As said in other reviews, this book takes you through the back story of Marcus Luttrell, through Indoc and BUD's, through his engagements and ultimately his ordeal of Op RedWing.    This is the most humbling book I have ever read. I highly recommend for a incredible insight into the mind of one of America's best.    Semper Fi.
0316017922|5.0|As the Beatles sang it, and Malcolm Gladwell shows us, we can all get by with a little help from our friends. Mix that help with other factors like finding the right family to be born into, picking your birthday and then working hard, and everyone can become that exceptional success, the outlier. It is learned through study by some, and probably intuitive to most, that grand success is purchased by herding the combination of factors that Gladwell presents. Even marginal success requires climbing on the broad shoulders of others. Thus, the beauty of Gladwell's work is not in his telling us anything new. It's how he pulls together his cross-topic research and delivers lively explanations of how Bill Gates, the Beatles and a host of less familiar figures achieved greatness. Some of the most stunning parts in Outliers are about the failures, some deadly, that happened to individuals and organizations that didn't master putting advantages and opportunities to work. Chris Langan's story stands out as a perfect example of genius unrecognized and undeveloped. While we probably don't know Chris Langan, we've probably met someone like him. Off-the-charts smart, but can't get a break. Besides the ideal coming together of culture, family and preparation, the writer doesn't dismiss the importance of luck. Serendipity (a student once defined it as a happy surprise) often plays the key role in success. Unlike many academics, it's obvious that the writer intends for this book to be read by a broad audience. Gladwell's clear, conversational style and use of simple tables to illustrate his points make it easily assessable to high school students, as well as, their parents and teachers. Even younger students can understand and appreciate certain chapters, especially the \\"10,000-Hour Rule.\\" If you don't want to miss (or be) a Chris Langan in your classroom or neighborhood, read this book.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|I purchased this stove for a solo bike tour I took because it was small. I was very impressed with its capabilities and size. Plus the entire kit nests into the pot. Does not work very good with Iso-Alcohol as I tested and rarely would a flame burn longer than a minute. Methyl Alcohol is ideal but I decided to try using Heet (a gas line anti-freeze) based on some suggestions I read online. It worked fantastic and was a bit more convenient than purchasing a vat of Methyl Alcohol. This setup also comes with the simmer ring which give you a little control of the output and can also be used to extinguish the stove. At first I thought the pot holder would be flimsy but it is more than adequate.
B001EHDWNK|3.0|I think the opening part of the book had a lot of promise. It moved along with a lot of mystery about what caused the \\"flashforward\\". The science and the paradoxes of time travel were well explored, too. But there was too much focus on a few people and what this meant to them. There are hundreds of scenarios that come to mind but these were not explored. Then the book fast forwards to 2030 and then we get 3-4 pages of the end of the earth, humanity and the sun's death.<br /><br />I liked most of the book, but like I said, I feel the author ran out of steam and stopped challenging us (or himself) near the end.
B001CU1RRM|5.0|I LOVE THIS  GREATEST HITS COLLECTION OF MICHAEL JACKSON BEGINNING WITH HIS  EARLY DAYS WITH  THE JACKSON 5!!!! HIGHLY RECOMENDED!! A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B001PR0Y5S|5.0|This movie is hysterically FUNNY! And I wasn't the only one who thought so....the entire audience roared with laughter....even the men sitting behind me thought it was funny, because it IS!<br /><br />When I left the theater I promised myself to own this one! That's why I'm here on Amazon. I was checking to see if it was released on DVD yet so I could buy it. The Proposal is one of those movies you can watch over and over and over and still enjoy it just because it's so funny. Ignore the bad reviews. This is a really good movie! Betty White was hilarious. Sandra Bullock was a hoot and her timing was impeccable. Ryan Reynolds was a perfect match for Sandra......great chemistry on the big screen! I can't wait to own this and have it to watch whenever the mood strikes me.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the Thief is one of my favorite Radiohead albums. It is an interesting album.  I still hear alot of Kid A in it but it definately rocks alot more and has a beautiful acoustic piece.    Hail to The Thief also contains There There which is probably my favorite Radiohead song period.  A Punchup at a Wedding has a beautiful rhythm to it, Where I End and You Begin is one of my favorites on the album.  The album ends with Scatterbrain and A Wolf At the Door, two songs I can never skip over. Love the way it starts, 2+2=5 and Sit Down Stand Up, great energy.    Actually the only song I do not like on the album is We Suck Young Blood but that is something personal with me.  It is a dirge and I tend to not like them regardless of who is doing them.    I like the rocking on this album mixed with the electronics, a different album where Kid A  and Amnesiac were quite similar and In Rainbows is different from Hail to the Thief. You can definately hear the evolution though.    If I was being introduced to Radiohead I would not start with this album but probably it would be third or fourth down the list.
B000NA1OXY|2.0|This won't take me long. Avril Lavigne's two previous albums had been somehow great and catchy in her own terms and somehow (I must repeat that word) I though I was listening to the next Alanis Morrissette but of course... I was wrong. I like Avril Lavigne and I think she is a talented little girl that was on her way to come up with her best album ever. \\"The best damn thing\\" carries in its name the first mistake conceived. Lavigne tries to sell the idea that this album is the best she has done and she might've said that when it was to be released but honestly this record is far from being mentioned that way or even to be remembered in a near future. The main problem that I must point out from this album is that Lavigne took \\"the easy road\\" to come up with it. As a fan i never understood how she was able to come up with a song like \\"Take me away\\" (Under my skin-2004) which I found interesting (musically speaking) or the songs \\"Nobody's home\\" (Under my skin-2008) and \\"Mobile\\" (Let go-2002) that were pretty great when now on this record we find songs like \\"Girlfriend\\" (her worst song so far... bad idea to be chosen as a first single), \\"The best damn thing\\" (kind of embarrasing lyrics) and \\"Everything back but you (mmmm... it seems that Lavigne wants to be Green Day here but instead she sounded like Blink-182).<br /><br />I just hope that Avril Lavigne finds herself again to come up with an album that reflects her talent.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Years after Terminator 2, John Conner (Nick Stahals) is a loner for his mother was presumed dead when she left him later as he matured. However he is still having bad dreams about judgment day even from the stuff his mother told him years ago as now The Terminator (Arnold Schwartzenegger) is back as he's reprogamed to protect John Conner yet again and another bad terminator who is a female terminator with the qualities of the first two Terminator villains named T-X (Kristianna Lokken) is set to kill John and future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) so it could set up judgment day including the rise of Skynet.<br /><br />Co-starring Earl Boen who played Dr. Silbermen from the first two movies and David Andrews, this is the weakest installment of the franchise which doesn't have the magic of the first two movies from James Cameron. Miss Lokken is quite sexy as the new villain but is no match for the deadly villains of the first two movies even the T-1000, Jonathan Mostow who directed \\"Breakdown\\" and \\"U-571\\" is in place of Cameron for this installment does offer some good action sequences and decent acting but it's quite flawed even with some of the corny humor thrown in. It's nowhere as good as the first two movies but still a fun entry including the new one.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Special Edition DVD has great extras like audio commentaries, interviews, trailer, featurettes, an HBO making-of documentary, intro by Arnold, gag reel, build your own action sequence feature, storyboards, datebase files on characters including history of the film franchise, deleted but funny Sgt. Candy scene and of course behind the scenes of the T3 video game.
1603580557|4.0|Great perspective on feedback loops and why systems are so hard to control and how the intuitive approach sometimes produces backwards results. I couldn't help but wish the author had a greater variety of real world examples ... maybe something from chemistry, psychology, accounting, computers, mechanics or even gardening. However, I think the author gives us enough new insight and ideas so we can do that ourselves. The book gives one hope that we can wrestle bits of understanding out of the chaos.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|What makes Changeling such a great movie?<br /><br />The Acting; AJ is at her finest here; this is a completely believable performance, which is important as this is described as \\"A True Story\\" as opposed to \\"Based on actual events\\". Jolie simply is the character.<br /><br />The directing; \\"Changeling\\" for me is probably Eastwood's finest effort, and I really think he is good to start with.<br /><br />The script; my kids were asking \\"can they do that\\"? \\"Did that happen?\\" It is not only a great and tragic story but interesting in that we see how laws and procedures have changed as a result of the publicity around the events.<br /><br />What is the down side?<br /><br />This is a tragedy. There is no happy ending. You will not be entertained. You will not enjoy this film, but it will move you, and stick with you for a long, long time.
B00005JM02|5.0|My almost two year old grand-daughter talks a lot. A typical recent conversation is \\"Hi Papa! Gqbxr, rtplkms regimgtddsts. Nemo, Papa!<br /><br />So we have watched \\"Finding Nemo\\" a bunch lately, which is fine because it is a great film. It's no \\"Little Mermaid\\", but it is probably better for kids in a lot of ways.<br /><br />First, I am a helpless romantic, but how good is it for my girls to watch movies where their happiness depends on them getting the prince? That was the typical message from Disney for years, so I guess there is something to be said about getting off of that message.<br /><br />Second, it deals with various disabilities in a helpful way. Going to a message about overcoming, trusting, and asking and accepting help, and that is a good message. Also key to my little family that is literally riddled with ADHD, Dory is a family hero.<br /><br />Third, When the movie is over, the screen saver is not annoying at all!<br /><br />And Lastly, (and most importantly) the story and the animation are first rate, and it is not painful at all to watch and re-watch to make my little grand-girl happy. Those snuggle times go by way to fast.
B001FB55H6|4.0|Be it as it may, the Watchmen is a good adaptation of the critically acclaimed graphic novel masterpiece. To put it plainly, this film was the best Hollywood could put together. Starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, a man who parodies the violent human nature. The beautiful Malin Akerman stars as Silk Spectre II, her side-kick, the Night-Owl is played by Patrick Wilson. The man who can take tanks and smash them with a flick of the wrist, and is the USA's only protection from a Soviet attack-Doctor Manhattan-is played by Billy Crudup. And finally, the mysterious, but at-the-same time, awesome, Rorschach, is played by Jackie Earle Haley.<br /><br />It is obvious that the Blu-Ray version of this film was a long-thought out and intensive process. First and foremost, this is the director's cut, so almost 25 minutes are added on to the already 2hr 40min film. The extended scenes really flow with the movie, and doesn't deteriorate the quality of the film. Exclusive to BD, is the new \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\", which features director, Zack Snyder, occasionally popping into the shot, while he thoroughly elaborates how he and his crew shot a particular shot, all of which is extremely fascinating.<br /><br />Disc two features 3, yup, count 'em, 3 documentaries. The first one, entitled, \\"The Phenomenon: The Comic That Changed Comics\\" talks about the enormity of the success that surrounded the Watchmen comic/graphic novel. It even has an interview with original artist, Dave Gibbons. The other two documentaries, while not as interesting, are exclusive to the BD version. Titled, \\"Real Superheroes, Real Vigilantes\\" and \\"Mechanics: Technologies of a Future World\\". Both examine some unknown aspects of the film material and characters.<br /><br />While the movie may dissapoint some fans, it is the best film Hollywood can ever make.

B001HN69AE|4.0|Ok so I went into this thinking that the movie would suck. Many people online talked about how horrible it was and how it was nothing like the TV show or the manga. I can't speak on behalf of the manga, as have never seen them, but I have to say that this movie did a great job creating a feel like the TV show! The over exaggerated styles, expressions and humor were a lot like the TV show! Heck, even some of the camera shots looked like scenes from the show... I do understand that Son Goku is suppose to be a kid and Grandpa Gohan is suppose to be dead, but they changed the story for a change from something we've all seen! If they made movies and made them the same as the TV series there would be nothing new in the movies! It would be the same episodes we've seen over and over and over etc... on Cartoon Network! I am up for something new and different as long as it keeps the same feel!    Also, keep in mind, from what I can tell, the director seemed to want to recreate Goku as someone we could see in real life, minus the Ki. They show him as an average teenage boy that isn't so average, in a life that can be related to our own somewhat. Anyone seen Smallville? Smallville did the same thing with Superman. Brought him down to a level where he was a modern day teen! I think this worked very well in this case.    Am I saying there aren't any flaws? NO!!!! There are flaws, but for me specifically the rest of the movie made up for them! Everyone is entitled to their opinions, hence why there are reviews, but if you watch DBE with an open mind and are a fan of the TV series i think you should thoroughly enjoy the movie! I now own it on blu ray and the picture and sound are AWESOME!    So what are some things I didn't like?:    The Music: I liked some of the music, but the music really fell short on creating a Dragonball fell for me... I didn't want it to be like the TV show or anything I just wanted it to take me in the world of DB by hearing it... No go there!    Airbending: Ok so agree with most on this one... Why did they take away the Ki blasts? I've seen people do it with photoshop! Don't get me wrong the scenes look impressive, but why couldn't they have done the Ki blasts?     Chi-Chi: I really disliked this character. If you imagined Chi-Chi as a teen after watching DBZ episodes, this is the last way I would think she would act... Did anyone else think this character was just wrong? I know I know most of you hated the whole movie, but look at her and compare her to the others... Very bad...    Final battle: I love the final battle minus the length!!! I didn't expect to be as long as in the TV series since most of the battle are them talking about fighting... This would make for a very LOOOONNNNGGGG movie! I still think it should have been a longer fight... it seemed too easy for Goku.      Also, I have to say that if you are complaining about Goku not being Asian then stop crying about it! He doesn't look Asian in the TV series! Why should he look Asian in the movie?!     This is my summary:  Great movie! Does it stick to the original story: no... Do I care? NO! It was great! It had flaws but was overall a good movie! I heard they have a sequel written  already. I say: BRING IT ON!! I am ready for a bunch of LIVE ACTION DB movies!! Remember watch with an open mind and you will like it!!!

B000002HEP|3.0|What's amazing is that the music on this Welcome to Sky Valley album is supposed to be exceptionally heavy and yet it's actually not.  It sounds like mid-tempo generic hard rock but stretched out into 14 minute \\"epic jams\\".    This is nothing compared to the legendary Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple lineup.  Kyuss is barely above average hard rock as far as songwriting, heaviness, and guitar skills are concerned.       The \\"Odyssey\\" jam is ripped off from classic Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow and specifically Ronnie James Dio.  Why listen to this band when you have superior rock bands doing the same thing nearly 30 years before?      I recommend you check out an old album from 1971 called UFO: Flying if you like this album.  It represents hard rock in just a few songs stretched out (just like this one) but done a LOT better on the UFO effort because the band members of UFO knew how to write better solos, riffs, and vocal melodies, not to mention had a lead singer who could really move you in an original fashion.

I am truly, amazed but it sounds wonderful.<br /><br />One of the ,1 star reviewers said it was rubbish, because he couldn't sing along to it .Oh, forget it ,i'm not even gonna start on that/him.

055358202X|2.0|I think the review of this book has been well covered by others and I am in agreement with the vast majority.  I eagerly awaited this book and was very disappointed, mostly in what elements of the story Martin chose to spend 800 pages introducing and/or exploring.  Expectations so often form the roots of disappointments, but that does not take away the sting of how far below the standard of the first 3 books this 4th one is.      The idea that AFFC is 1/2 of a very long book that had to be split in 2 (ADWD being the second half) seems a poor excuse for the ongoing delays and promises in getting the 5th book finished and published.  As another reviewer noted, at this rate we can expect the 7th (and claimed final) book in 2022!  Maybe it is simply a writer's block from a planned trilogy expanding to 7 volumes and Martin's problems sorting out the structure.  Maybe it is a deeper problem than that.  Maybe Martin doesn't know where the story is going or ending up.  That's not the end of the world; only if Martin was more intellectually honest and respectful of his audience.  It is what King did with The Dark Tower series.  For years he was frank in saying \\"I don't know where the story is going yet.\\"  That was frustrating for the reader, but perhaps it is better to wait for something than to wind up feeling confused-disappointed-cheated (pick one) by such a let down as AFFC.      While I wait for the next book (I am not ready to give up yet) I will re-read the first 3 truly inspired books at a leisurely pace, skip this one, and hopefully by then ADWD will be out and everything we all are hoping for.  I am skeptical.  Skeptical enough, in fact, to check it out of the library rather than risk my money at another disappointment.

Joe Walsh's Rocky Mountain Road and Don Henley's Boys of Summer both make unforgettable appearances.
0545123267|5.0|Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater is a touching love story about Sam and Grace- two kindred souls with a mysterious connection.  Sam lives two lives- one as a human and another as a wolf. He is human during the spring and summer months and turns into a wolf when the temperature drops during fall and winter.  Unfortunately this transformation only occurs for a limited amount of time and then he will remain a wolf forever.  Grace is human but has always been drawn to the wolves that appear every winter in the woods behind her home.  When Grace was a young child she was attacked by these wolves and has felt a connection with them since.  One wolf seems to always be there watching her and protecting her.  She is inexplicably drawn to this mysterious wolf with its beautiful yellow eyes.  The summers are always brutal for Grace because she longs for the cold that brings her wolf back to her.  This cycle repeats for years until Grace is 17 years old. The town is in an uproar over a wolf attack and the hunt begins.  Once Grace learns that Sam is her wolf she is desperate to keep him with her.  They know that Sam's is going to change soon and this will be the last time-he will remain a wolf forever.  Sam and Grace take the reader on an emotional roller coaster while they fight to hold onto each other and their love.  This was a wonderful love story full of romance, longing and  discovery.  I read late into the night because I HAD to find out how it ended!  Readers that enjoy the \\"supernatural\\" genre will surely love this book and will eagerly await its sequel \\"Linger\\".

Another good thing about this movie,<br />is the sound track...everything from acid music to hillbilly..to christian signing hymms......they all sound good and keeps the movie going.  And what i like about the character is that every accident that he caused, he paused to make sure no one was hurt. This is not a vengeance or body count movie....its just a fun wild ride of a movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I exercise pretty regularly but found even the lowest level workout to be challenging. I don't use this video regularly, but find it is a good substitute when I don't feel like going to the gym or have limited time.  I've used this dvd while traveling in my hotel room to get a good, quick workout (substituted exercise bands for weights). It doesn't burn a ton of calories for me like a longer aerobic workout does, but it really works my core muscles. I give this dvd five stars because it's a strong workout, I haven't gotten bored with it yet, and I like Jillian's no-nonsense attitude.
B0021L8UPI|5.0|I have seen quite a few of these \\"evil children\\" thriller/horror movies, such as \\"the bad seed\\", \\"the good son\\" and \\"the Omen\\". Of these movies, Orphan most reminds me of \\"the good son\\", but for a more adult audience.<br /><br /> In a \\"careful what you wish for plot\\", a depressed mother tries to fill the void by adopting a child. Unfortunately she chooses Esther, the extremely talented, cute and quiet Orphan, with a hidden past of terror. Isabelle Furhman plays the part of Esther, and does a spectacular job. The movie is full of unique characters, but it's Isabelle Furhman who really steals the show (no wonder she is the star of the movie).<br /><br />I will certainly add this movie to my DVD collection when it becomes available. Do yourself a favor. Go out, have fun and watch one of the better movies of the year.
B001OQCV9M|3.0|As you can never have too much butter, you can also never have too much Meryl Streep and Amy Adams; they are once again delightful to watch, playing characters that are superbly favorable and enhanced with humorous screenwriting. The drama, comedy and cooking is all skillfully balanced, although with a two-hour runtime, the pacing isn't the most perceptive. It's an entertaining, enjoyable film, brilliantly combining two stories into one to demonstrate the influence and similarities between them. While the event is never unappealing, it's also not exceedingly revolutionary.<br /><br />Julie & Julia is based on two best-selling memoirs, one from famous cook Julia Child about her life in France, and the other by Julie Powell, a woman who's life was greatly affected by Child's cookbook. The film carefully weaves the two together, alternating between Child's (Meryl Streep) struggles in Europe and Powell's (Amy Adams) conflicts in New York. Both are fueled by the healing power of cooking, a passion for food and the perfect kind of butter.<br /><br />In 1949 France, Julia Child settles in with her diplomat husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) to a new environment and tries to sort out what she wants to do with her time. After determining that she has an uncanny love of food (shopping for groceries is as much fun to her as other women find buying a new dress), she takes up schooling with professionals, eventually teaches a few students, and works on collaborating on her own enormous cookbook. When she can't find any French cookbooks written for Americans, she knows she's found her calling.<br /><br />On the other side of the globe and in the year 2002, Julie Powell is adapting to a new apartment in Queens with her writer husband Eric (Chris Messina) and her depressing job as a government agency secretary. Her spare time is devoted to food as well - both women find relief in the preparation of food almost more than eating it. When her day job starts to really wear away at her soul, she decides to write an internet blog that explains a unique goal she sets for herself: to prepare every recipe in Julia Child's cookbook - 524 recipes in 365 days. Initially she must deal with a lack of readership (simply throwing words out into a void, which is what blogging nowadays has really become), the negativity of her mother, the strain on the relationship with her husband, a lobster killing ordeal, and the most formidable task of boning a duck.<br /><br />For Julie and Julia, cooking is a method of getting away from the troubles of real life. They are saved by food. For the audience, the two leads once again prove their talents, although this is not a movie to watch on an empty stomach. Director Nora Ephron handles the material well, blending the two narratives, the two locations and comedy and drama into a delicious tale of a deliriously cheery woman and a typical, practical city girl who are liberated by preparing the most mouthwatering treats. It's a simple, charmingly pleasant film well worth a look, but also certainly not a masterpiece.<br /><br />- Mike Massiee an internet blog that explains a unique goal she sets for herself: to prepare every recipe in Julia Child's cookbook - 524 recipes in 365 days.

B0000028M7|4.0|Alice in Chains, the first and best band in the genre of now deceased grunge music, released \\"Dirt\\" in 1992 in which is one of my personal favorites. This is another review for other idiots...Ok. First of all, why would somebody review this album and say that the music sucks because its droopy, slow or sad? The genre of this band is \\"grunge\\". Hince the word grunge, this genre is a slow, hypnotizing, somber side of metal that was very popular in the 90s with bands like AIC, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Stone Temple Pilots, etc. Second of all, if you dont like slow, grungy music, then dont listen to Alice in Chains if you know thats their type of music. Third of all, this band is far more talented and heavy than any of the afore mentioned bands, all of which i am a fan of. Why do you review this album if you dont like grunge music? Youre an idiot. Youre wasting your time listening to something you know you wont like. Lastly, since when did Staind become a real band? Are you serious? Listen to real \\"grunge\\" like Staind? Real grunge doesnt even exist anymore, and Aaron Lewis is just a loser who decided to whine and cry about everything to the tune of a guitar and the beat of a drum. One of the most untalented bands to ever surface. Also, whoever says Layne Stayley cannot sing is a retard. Are yall listening or are you just high? He has one of the most unique and recognizable voices in the history of American rock and roll. So shut up.
B0019LY5I2|2.0|For many, the outlandish threat of nanotechnology and biochemical warfare utilized by a technologically advanced arms dealer with a plot to rule the world might be slightly over-the-top, but when it comes to the world of G.I. Joe, it's a rather fitting adversary for the elite military group. But there's a difference between those generally accepting of such escapism in toy-based action movies and those who actually possess knowledge of the vast array of characters from the Hasbro-created world. Sadly, the latter group will be dismayed by the drastic changes to their beloved organization (now an international group - so much for A Real American Hero). Costume alterations are almost mandatory these days to avoid the brightly colored garb of once awe-inspiring superheroes, but these Joes have suffered from over-modernization and most are virtually unrecognizable from their comic book and figurine counterparts. Not to mention their individual backstories have undergone such extreme revisions it's a wonder they kept the same code names. At least plenty of stuff blows up.<br /><br />After a deadly biochemical weapon is stolen from their squad during a transport mission, Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are introduced to the G.I. Joe, an elite military group of special operatives. Joining the unit in a super-secret underground base known as The Pit, under the command of General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), the two soldiers team up with Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Breaker (Said Taghmaoui), and more to stop a maniacal arms dealer hell-bent on world domination.<br /><br />G.I. Joe opens with the phrase \\"In the Not Too Distant Future,\\" but should have read \\"In a Galaxy Far, Far Away...\\" With the dizzying amount of futuristic technology, boundless financing and all-encompassing intel, there isn't really anything in the film that's grounded in reality. Least of all the mechanical accelerator suits that give the wearer superhuman powers, the gargantuan undersea laboratory or the nanomite warheads that eat through everything like GORT from the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still. Few people will recall playing with those creations from the Hasbro toy company. In terms of faithfulness to the original line of figurines that became a household name in the 80s, about all that is retained are the names.<br /><br />Baroness goes through multiple outfit changes like a twisted dark Barbie, Dubble Bubble is now the official gum of the Joes, Ripcord hands out life lessons and theories on attraction and bizarre relationships between the main characters conflict with every comic book and cartoon show storyline before it. With a Wayans brother in the lead and a cameo by Brendan Fraser, the level of seriousness (or lack thereof) is immediately apparent. Even the CG is too ambitious, occasionally slacking on vehicle designs and movement. When a shot of a computer animated polar bear is necessary, perhaps it's time to rethink the amount of graphics to utilize.<br /><br />Director Stephen Sommers also couldn't seem to eliminate the need for Arnold Vosloo (who played the mummy in his earlier films) or pyramids. At least the director embraced nonstop action, destruction and general mayhem (in what seems to be a competition against Roland Emmerich), which gives the film an undeniable level of excitement, even if it's frequently lessened by comical yet authentic \\"Knowing is half the battle!\\" blurbs. Duke sums it up when he exclaims, \\"That was crazy! I didn't expect that!\\" after plowing through Paris streets in his accelerator suit to protect a doomed Eiffel Tower. Except that we did expect just about every memorable aspect of G.I. Joe lore to be completely redefined in this explosive, outlandish, and most of all silly, action extravaganza.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsoratory or the nanomite warheads that eat through everything like GORT from the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still.

B0000AGWJ7|4.0|Waking the Fallen is a good album from a good band. People keep saying they're \\"wannabes\\" and \\"posers\\", and \\"theyre not real metalcore\\". Well guess who put that title on them? Yall. They are not metalcore, they are not hardcore, they are not death metal, and nobody ever in their right mind said they had power metal in their music, thats retarded. They are just heavy metal and whats wrong with that? Why does it always have to be \\"oh theyre not hardcore enough\\" or \\"theyre just wannabes of every other band\\". Seriously you guys sound like 12 year olds. The singer, by the way, sounds nothing like Chad from Nickelback, youre an idiot. Nickelback is a terrible band. I bet you \\"metalheads\\" cant even play half of a riff from this album. A7X has their own unique sound, most of their songs being fast paced with alot of double guitar work for almost the full duration of the album. Forget all the \\"brands\\" of this band, just pop in this cd and enjoy some rock and roll. This guy is a decent singer, and hes got an alright yell. but his voice flows well with the music, which sounds like punk mixed with aggressive metal. Anyways, dont listen to these idiots on here, ill be the first to tell you that they dont know what they are talking about.
B001UV4XL0|3.0|When you include the word \\"perfect\\" in your movie's title, you leave yourself a rather easy target for cunning wordsmiths should the film not at least live up to the expectations of the genre. Double entendre aside, A Perfect Getaway does fulfill the suspense promised by the trailer and even throws in a little nastily creative violence, but also sadly offers far too many twists and turns and the much-dreaded flashback - letting the audience know they couldn't have figured it out themselves. It becomes quite obvious early on that things are not what they seem, so attempting to guess the outcome replaces the tension; and oddly intentional screenwriting references spoil several surprises. By the end you should be able to decipher American Jedi from angry hitchhikers, but will you care? It's a credit to David Twohy's directing that you probably will, but the only real getaway is the climax when it perfectly escapes from the credibility of the plot.<br /><br />For their honeymoon, newlyweds Cliff (Steve Zahn) and Cydney (Milla Jovovich) head to the tropical islands of Hawaii. While journeying through the paradisiacal countryside the couple encounters Kale (Chris Hemsworth) and Cleo (Marley Shelton), two mean-spirited hitchhikers and Nick (Timothy Olyphant) and Gina (Kiele Sanchez), two wild but well-meaning spirits who help guide them through the lush jungles. The picturesque waterfalls and scenic mountainsides quickly give way to terror when Cliff and Cydney learn of a grisly murder that occurred nearby and realize that they're being followed by chance acquaintances that suspiciously fit the description of the killers...<br /><br />To say that A Perfect Getaway brings new meaning to the idea of a twist ending would be overly generous. It does indeed keep the audience guessing, but it's more of a twist middle; in an attempt to outsmart the viewer, the film resorts to entirely too much explaining, flashbacks and backstory to educate on details conveniently left out for mystery purposes. It would be more accurate to say that this film is too smart for its own good. Perhaps what is most predictable is the inclusion of twists in the first place, some of which are downright silly. The story doesn't necessarily fall apart because of the unexpected happenings - it fails because of the execution and explanation of the surplusage of red herrings.<br /><br />What works well is the constant comedy. Like most capable suspense films, the anticipation for shocks and instantaneous turns are surrounded by humor. Since Steve Zahn is primarily known for comedies, his casting was an especially competent choice. Jovovich, however, feels consistently inauthentic and her chemistry with Zahn is forced. The foreshadowing is expected and humorous, the misdirection is keen, the scares are a tad gimmicky, the suspense is decent and the movie-within-a-movie side conversations are relatively cheesy. With lines like \\"Nothing bad ever happens in Hawaii, right?\\" by Zahn and \\"He's really hard to kill,\\" spoken by the red herring's girlfriend, the barrage of twists is inevitable. It's too bad that most just aren't cleverly introduced or defined.<br /><br />- The Massie TwinsIt would be more accurate to say that this film is too smart for its own good.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have been watching the tv show since it started and fell in love immediately. (It's so hot!) Even my history channel-watching boyfriend loves it!  When Season 2 started, I'd thought I would start reading the book series(after being so disappointed with Twilight). I am now on Book 7 and have to say that while the books vary greatly from the tv show, it made not an ounce of difference. I am enjoying both separately (although sometimes I mix up story lines from the books to the tv show).   If you are expecting to see the tv show ripped from the book series, don't even bother watching. But you'll be missing the best show on tv since the Sopranos and SATC.

This book helps everyone understand modern investment instruments and how they work and why they didn't. Never forget no matter how its packaged debt, debt, debt is..Bad, bad, bad. Unless you are Larry McDonald he will find a way to make money no matter what. I'm sure the old Bear in his Cape Cave is laughing as he sits on his stack of cash. I had the HONOR of playing golf with the old bear at Woods Hole, and he did call this whole thing long ago. We all thought he was nuts, but as he said nothing changes! Never truer words spoken.

B00004SVGE|1.0|I ordered this disc based on the title put out by Amazon that says \\"DVD-Audio\\".  The disc is in fact a DTS-CD.  Since I purchased from an Amazon Marketplace seller and the UPC code matches, I cannot ask the seller for return/refund.
0061767581|5.0|I loved this book!!  I am a fan of Lauren Conrad, but admittedly I wasn't sure how good this book would be or if it would be too young for me.  But I was hooked from the first page.  If you love The Hills, I am sure you will enjoy this book as well.  It was a fast paced, engaging behind-the-scenes look at the lives of young reality stars on a fictitious show called LA Candy on the fictional channel Pop TV,  especially the character of Jane.  I finished the book this morning and can't wait for the next in the series.  I would recommend this book as a great book to take to the beach or on an airplane flight.

B000002PCS|5.0|I'm glad I happened upon this soundtrack after all these years. Had never seen the movie but bought it for a friend (and one for myself) who was visiting Mackinac Island this summer. Bought the soundtrack with the idea of giving it to her, also, but after watching the movie and hearing the hauntingly beautiful music decided to keep it for myself! (Maybe I'll get her a copy sometime..LOL)  Now that I have discovered it I play it often; to me, it almost sounds like a \\"prayer\\".    (many might wonder what rock I had been living under not to have seen the movie or been aware of the music before now.......there is an answer to that)
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I bought this when it came out and frankly I put it away I could not stand the rehash of Beatles music< I thought John and George must be turning in their graves because the way the original songs were messed up for this stupid show. When I learned that the remaster would be coming in Sept 09, I got the cd out again and listened using my headphones and was blown away by the clarity of the music, it's as if it had been recorded recently using state of the art equipment. Now I cannot wait to hear all this great music without all the raping it was put through. ps if you have a DVD-A player with 6ch input in your receiver then use that mode instead it's a lot better than plain dvd or cd

B0010YSD7M|5.0|For all it's worth the movie was true to all the characters. Only I wish we got to see more of Richard Dean Anderson. I wish that Stargate:Universe would star Teal'C or Smantha Carter.  It would combine the old and the new and give the show a better chance of staying on the air. I just couldn't get used to the Atlantis series and wish we saw more direct to DVD movies with the originals.<br /><br />This one had more of the same aliens for the conclusion.  I'd like to see more in the way of the personal relationships the characters have after being part of the SG-1 program.  We didn't get to see a lot of what happened to Richard Dean Anderson's character, and It would have been nice to see how he copes with his new environment as General O'Neil.
B00008AJL5|5.0|You better F'in believe that the sounds that come from the Young brothers axes on this bit are the absolute rawest guitar sounds ever put down on wax. This is an album that demands volume. I've put it on once or twice, just to play as background music at a low decible... and it's never long before the switch is cranked. This music is meant to engulf a room with pulsing bass, thumping drums, and guitar that shredddds. Some guitars shred, but this F*KKKKKKIN SHRRRRRREDS!!!! You can feel it right against your eardrums... it feels awesome.<br /><br />Now, as far as imports to domestics go, the only reason to buy an imported AC/DC album would have to be for the tracks that were never pressed on US versions. The aussie release of LTBR has a track called Crabsody in Blue, but it doesn't seem to be on this import, therefore I recommend looking elsewhere for this track (try the version with the different album cover), or just getting the domestic print. ***FYI: I have all of AC/DC's recorded material, and in my opinion Crabsody is pretty much garbage/filler. For an album that plays out entirely with loud, raw, and twisted chords and sheer intensity, the slow bluesy Crabsody is completely out of place, and almost sounds like a poor demo tape. Prob my least favorite track out of the Bon years. I say, Fuh-get about it! Crabs.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a must have album. It bridges AC/DC's earliest punk like basement productions, to their later more polished productions of the Bon era. With Let There Be Rock the idea was to blow up speakers. This album almost puts Bon Scott in the background and focuses on the Young brothers completely... however Bon still makes himself well noticed on tracks like BAD BOY BOOGIE and PROBLEM CHILD.<br /><br />[*imported to domestic 101 revisited, Problem Child was actually on Dirty Deeds originally, but since LTBR was released in the US before Dirty Deeds it wound up on this album,... if you find the import release with Crabsody on it, it will be in place of Problem Child... ironically the U.S. release of Dirty Deeds, released in 1981 also includes Problem Child, so you can work around it if need be.]<br /><br /> BUT SERIOUSLY, if you are unfamiliar with this album and are a fan of Angus Youngs riffs on other AC/DC albums, this is his prime masterpiece. Get it anyway you can! This is music you can truly FEEL! Thank the production team of Vanda/Young for putting this unrelenting and absolutely amazing noise onto tape!m Child... ironically the U.S. release of Dirty Deeds, released in 1981 also includes Problem Child, so you can work around it if need be.]     BUT SERIOUSLY, if you are unfamiliar with this album and are a fan of Angus Youngs riffs on other AC/DC albums, this is his prime masterpiece.

0783240287|3.0|Good points: Donny Osmond, choreography.    Bad points: idiotic costumes.    Pointless: setting.    Osmond is a good singer and a great actor who truly brings Joseph to life. I was prepared to dislike him, but he had a lot of heart and I liked his Joseph.    I think the producers were trying to do too much: to market to an adult audience (blue body-painted cheerleaders, full frontal Joan Collins?) market to a child audience (uber bright colors, narrator eating chicken wings) and paying tribute to the show as it was originally conceived for a private school.     The private school show-within-a-show does not work.  At what school that parents actually pay money for would it be ok for the music teacher to show up topless in the school play? Having the narrator show up with stage fright before she does the show didn't work, either. She's supposed to be driving, here, not carried along.    Bottom line? My pre-k age daughter and I will watch the stuff on Youtube that is appropriate for her, we'll pay money for the stage show when some local school performs it, but we will not pay for this DVD.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow!  I consider myself very athletic and advanced.  I run, I bike and I swim and I usually do The Firm videos which I love.  I thought I would purchase Jillian's videos to give my muscles something different to think about -- well, let me tell you, I was exhausted at the end of this video.  I started with the hardest segment and worked my way backwards to do all three segments in 60 minutes.  The wierd thing is, when it started, the exercises looked like a piece of cake, I mean old school type stuff -- but they are really hard to do and my muscles were really tired.  I'm not trying to scare you, but these workouts really will whip you into shape.  I would highly recommend this video to burn the fat and calories -- Jillian isn't kidding when she says \\"shred\\"!

1594202249|5.0|Pynchon cranks out another winner with \\"Inherent Vice\\", though I found it to be a lot different than some of his other works. Here he tackles the detective genre in the hard-boiled vein of Chandler, and it's set in the sixties, no less.     Yet if you can look past the flashy cover and its relatively small size (weighing in at less than 400 pages, it's the smallest of Pynchon's works in decades), you'll see that you still have a Pychon novel, through and through. Despite its short length, it's most certainly a complex novel, with Pynchon's staple humor, social commentary and culture study running rampant throughout. Set in the last years of the dying hippie era, Pynchon has a lot to say about this strange period in our history, yet manages to produce some insight not limited to a single point in time.      As always, Pynchon provides us with an engaging, and usually outlandish, story to keep it all together. For its size and for the nature of the plot, most readers will find \\"Inherent Vice\\" to be one of Pynchon's more accessible works, and I'd probably have to agree with that. This is a book you can read in a night or two, yet it's something you can come back and read again with ease in order to catch things you missed. As others have mentioned, \\"Inherent Vice\\" is a good gateway novel to the author's other work, yet I urge first-time readers to be a bit careful. You do not jump into Pynchon's universe, head-first. \\"Inherent Vice\\" is a figurative cake-walk when compared to Pynchon's earlier work, so watch yourself.      In the end, it's delightful that Pynchon still manages to surprise us after all these years, and provide us with such quality reading. He is a truly versatile and insightful writer. His skills know no bounds, and we're genuinely lucky to still have him around. My only concern is how long we'll have to wait for his next one.
B00005MNP8|5.0|With Deborah Harry as the clear focal point of the band, let's focus on her.  She can be aggressive (\\"Hanging on the Telephone\\") and she can be dreamy (\\"Picture This\\").  She can be \\"cold as ice cream, but still as sweet\\" (\\"Sunday Girl\\") and she can be \\"hanging on a frequency and burning like a fire\\" (\\"11:59\\").  She can be snide (\\"I Know But I Don't Know\\"), she can be stuck-up (\\"Just Go Away\\"), and she can be seductive (\\"Heart of Glass\\").  As the remarkably strong music asserts, it's not because she's moody.  She's just deep.
0071410945|3.0|A short book like this deserves a short review. This book is less about technique and more about procedure. Young's most important point is that new ideas come about through making connections with other disparate ones. Apart from that the book reads more like an ad man's notebook and is very dated. Historically interesting but of limited use.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|Trying to keep my mind off some current events I decided to immerse myself in the world of pop-country (go figure) and since I am absolutely obsessed with Swift's triumphant `Love Story' I decided that her album `Fearless' was next on my list.  I wasn't really expecting too much from this album; a few scattered songs of interest corrupted by endless ballads and corny `teeny-bop' tracks maybe.  Instead I actually got one of the better albums I've heard recently and quite frankly one of my personal favorite daily distractions.<br /><br />Not a single track is bad; seriously.<br /><br />Like I do with most my `music' reviews, I'm going to dive into this one from my personal favorite track down to my least favorite.<br /><br />First of all, the best track here is not `Love Song', even if I absolutely adore that track with every fiber of my being (for those of you interested, I finally caved in and actually chose a Taylor Swift song for my ringtone but it wasn't `Love Story'; it was this one).  The best track on `Fearless' is the closing track, `Change', an inspirational up-tempo ballad that sends shivers down my spine beings that it touches upon the very hopeful thinking I find myself in lately.  I NEEDED this song, and so when I heard it I instantly became invested.  There's a line in the song where she says that `there is something in your eyes says we can beat this' and that sticks out to me as so relevant.  I just cannot hear this song enough.<br /><br />Hallelujah.<br /><br />`White Horse' and `You're Not Sorry' and both beautifully constructed tracks; both soft and delicate and sincere.  `White Horse' is probably my second favorite track on the album, for it showcases Swift's vocals beautifully.  Taylor does not have the best voice in the industry.  She cannot hit the notes that Carrie Underwood or Martina McBride can, but she has a gift for penning her own songs and delivering relevant teenage drama in a nicely constructed package.  While her vocals may not be spellbinding; there is not a track on the album that is not engaging.  `You're Not Sorry' would have worked better with an Underwood vocal finish (just think Carrie's work on `I Know You' and you'll know what I mean) but Swift is capable of delivering us a youthful yet mature rendition of love lost.<br /><br />I'll take a bow in `Love Story's direction now...impeccably done; fun, spunky, endearing.<br /><br />`Tell Me Why' and `The Way I Loved You' are up-tempo gems here; real country feel complete with catchy chorus lines and singable lyrics.  I particularly LOVE the feel of `Tell Me Why' even if I personally prefer `The Way I Loved You'.  Both tracks are a total joy to listen to; fun and fresh.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Colbie Caillat (such a talented singer/songwriter) and so `Breathe' is a total winner for me.  I personally wish that Colbie had more to do than just sing background vocals, since her vocal styling is so genuine and pure to me, but you can feel her presence on the entire song.  Even the musical arrangement sounds like a Colbie track as apposed to a Swift song.<br /><br />`Fearless', `Hey Stephen', `You Belong With Me' and `Forever & Always' are all nicely done and easy to listen to.  I personally adore `Hey Stephen', and `You Belong With Me' is already tearing up the radio stations as we speak.  It's easy to see why.  The song is fun and catchy and relevant.  Sure, it can be labeled clich&eacute;d, but it is smartly written and spearheaded right at the right audience.  `Fearless', the albums open, sounds like a slower paced version of `Change' (listen to the musical arrangements of both and tell me you don't see a similarity), and I personally like that decision.  It makes the album feel full circle.<br /><br />`Fifteen' and `The Best Day' are conceptually better than they are in construction.  They are very personal tracks, and I totally love that about them, but in respect to the other songs on the album they lack the `pop' the others have.  Ilike them (I think I prefer `Fifteen', although `The Best Day' actually brought me to tears the first time I heard it) but they are my least favorites on the album.<br /><br />That said, the album is a very complete package.  Even those two tracks I'm less enthusiastic about are well worth listening to and don't warrant a skip by any means.  Taylor is young but she is smart, and she knows how to write songs that appeal to her audience.  Any teenager can relate to the issues mentioned here, and even some of us non-teenagers can appreciate the maturity with which she attacks some of these subjects.  I'm pleasantly surprised with this album and recommend it with absolutely NO reservations!o tears the first time I heard it) but they are my least favorites on the album.

B001EO748M|5.0|I watched seasons one and two on showtime, this product was excellent in all ways and there were changes in some of the scenes and script that made more sense than what was actually on screen.  The discs are in excellent condition and I would not hesitate to buy from this site again.
1573300403|3.0|The cd was received in good timing. However, the cd looks like a copy. I thought I would get an original cd with pictures and info on Michael Jackson like most dvd's and cd's have.
B000096I9G|5.0|This is a great DVD and it is well worth the price I paid for it. The performances really do justice to the Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers albums,and the sound quality is great. The purchase is worth it just for the Bloodflowers set, but the whole thing is entertaining. The band is not off key, as some reviewers have said, but rather it's a live performance, which usually sounds a little different from the album tracks. Anyway, if you watch the bonus interviews with the band (which are worthwhile), you will learn that The Cure played all three of the \\"trilogy\\" albums in their entirety on two separate dates in Berlin. Only the better of the two performances of each song (as judged by Robert Smith) were included on the DVD. Therefore, even if something may have been off key in the concert, which is doubtful, it wouldn't have happened two nights in a row on the same song, and therefore would not have made it onto the DVD. That said, I am completely satisfied with this video and really $10 for a brand new two disc DVD (over 3 hours of concert footage) isn't really splurging, especially for a fan of The Cure.
B0015DWLD0|4.0|The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga was my first book read on my kindle. I picked it up on July 31st and finished it yesterday, August 5th while waiting for my son's tonsillectomy to finished. The book is hard to separate from the movie Slumdog Millionaire. The story takes place in India, the main character is from a poor village and is a servant to the rich (a driver). It's graphic, disturbing and at some times really smart. The entire book is written as a letter to the Premier of China over the course of a week. I could relate with the main character and although he does a terrible thing, I sympathized with him. I could see this riding the coattails of Slumdog and making it into theaters soon. I recommend this book. 4/5
B001AVCFK6|4.0|I am a huge Star Trek fan. I remember as a kid seeing the originals (or at least the first two seasons when they were on at a time I could stay up to) when they were aired and of course in sydication for what seems like forever. The first Star Trek movie (The Motion Picture) thankfully was not a warning of things to come and the next three were very enjoyable. The franchise started losing its way after that as far as the movies go and except for a few bright spots from \\"Generations\\" seemed doomed to come to a close. ST:TNG went a long way to bringing it back in a good way on the small screen (though the first season was pretty bad IMO), and there was enough fun and drama in the other shows to make them watchable.     By the time Enterprise was yanked (just as it started to get really good), it seemed that the ship had been grounded. A few years later JJ puts his hand in it and the trailers had me interested enough to hold off judgement. Glad I did as the the movie was a roller coaster from the opening sequence and rarely let you catch your breath. Sure I could quibble about a few things (like how the Enterprise was built and commanded by a Captain April some 30-40 years before Pike and Kirk had their shot at it), but overall this was exactly what Star Trek needed. A new beginning. Pine does a pretty good job as Kirk, but the real standout in Quinto as Spock. If you didn't see it in the theaters, you missed out on the best way to see the film but either on DVD or BluRay with a decent TV will be a good experience too. For all those complaining about how all the prior Trek is now gone...never fear. This is an alternate universe, not a replacement. So all your beloved shows are still relevent.    Don't let yourself be blind to what is a great flick and a worthy entry into Star Trek lore.

B00005JLWN|3.0|EQUILIBRIUM offers an entertaining rehash of movies that have gone before, most notably the ideological concept of FAHRENHEIT 451 mixed with a gun toting version of the wire fu martial arts action of THE MATRIX. It asks the question is peace among all mankind worth any price we have to pay--even a total loss of emotional experiences? While the film offers very little that is truly new but it is a pleasant way to pass the time and may be thought provoking if you haven't seen FAHRENHEIT or the countless other films with similar themes. There are a couple of twists and turns that make it fairly interesting. For further information read any of the scores of reviews by people who cared more about this Christian Bale flick than I did.
1584282584|5.0|I've visited [...] from time to time and found his pictures gorgeous, and the descriptions good as well.  What I didn't understand was why he could command $500 for a day long workshop.  Now I get it.  This author is a genious, and he puts it all on the line.  This book doesn't just show some examples and throw out camera settings used to take the photograph.  He explains in full detail the thought process, and the science that he went through in order to take the short.  I was a bit apprehensive as to the detail in this smaller book.  I'm used to photography books being over 200 pages and choc full of images.  This book is very different.  The conventional book I can sit down and read front to back in a short period of time and say, \\"oh that was nice\\".  Neil's book was more akin to some heavy reading.  Each chapter felt like a thick steak with so much detail.  After reading just 10 pages, I'd have to put down the book with so much useful information that I just learned.  When I'm done reading this, I'm going to pick it up again and read it again, because of that very reason -- There is soo much good detail.  Highly recommended.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|With 2009 marking the 40th anniversary of Man's first footsteps on the Moon, I can't think of a better way to celebrate than to enjoy the Tom Hanks/Imagine Entertainment HBO miniseries, \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\", now available at an amazingly low price. The 12-episode saga, touted as one of the most expensive TV productions ever made, at that time (at $65 million), certainly displays where the money went, with incredible recreations of the spacecraft, lunar surface, and activities far above our planet...but the real triumph of the miniseries are the stories of the men and women who made this adventure possible, from the astronauts and their wives, to the often-forgotten scientists, technicians, and support personnel, whose dreams, faith, and dedication made the impossible happen!<br /><br />This miniseries makes a terrific companion piece to \\"The Right Stuff\\", as it opens with the 'Gemini' program that followed 'Mercury', and the selection of new astronauts to build upon the foundation of the original seven. The fact that America was certainly lagging behind the Soviet space program is not white-washed, and the Soviet triumphs actually provide an incentive to work harder and faster...which would create an astonishing series of technological advances, but would also result in the tragedy of Apollo One, and the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. Added to this were the changing sentiments of the times, as our country was rocked by assasinations and mob violence, the horror of Vietnam, and waning interest in space, and the fact that NASA still fulfilled President Kennedy's promise of a man on the moon by the end of the decade becomes even more remarkable.<br /><br />There are great stories, each episode, often involving persons and events you may never have heard of, from the Grumman team who invented the lunar module from scratch, to the 'White Room' personnel whose humor and ministrations would be the last human contact the space crews would experience until they returned to earth. A whole episode is devoted to a geologist who teaches the crews not only the basics of his field, but the love and excitement to be found in a single 'special' rock. Of course, the Astronauts' stories are fascinating (from Alan Shepard's fight to overcome a 'permanent' inner ear condition, and return to space, to the endearing silliness of Apollo 12, with the hijinks of Conrad, Bean, and Gordon), with the importance of Frank Borman (David Andrews), highlighted, as his low-keyed sincerity 'saves' the space program after Apollo One, he reads Scripture while orbiting the Moon, and he deals with the descent into alcoholism of his wife (Hanks' real-life spouse, Rita Wilson, who is brilliant). The performance of Lane Smith, as a fictitious reporter patterned after Walter Cronkite (who also appears, in clips), should be singled out, as television news changed dramatically, during the Apollo years, as well, and his struggle to maintain integrity as the media turned to sensationalism rings very true.<br /><br />An entire disk is devoted to Special Features, with a terrific 'Making of' documentary, and fascinating info about the Moon, Solar System, and our galaxy.<br /><br />Truly, a 'Must Have', for any DVD collection!returned to earth.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I am a male Personal Trainer that has a large clientele of females. Two of my clients became pregnant last year and they both asked me to keep training them throughout their pregnancy. I was a little apprehensive about that because of their condition. During their first trimester they both complained that I wasn't the same trainer, that I was being too easy on them. I was hesitant to push them like I did before. So I purchased Erin's DVD and watched it several times until I came up with a routine like hers. I appreciated the fact that Erin was about 9 months pregnant when she shot this DVD. They were both happy that it was challenging but not overly tough. I adjusted the intensity down as they got further along. I'm happy to say that one stayed with me for 8 months and the other for 7 months. Both babies' were healthy when they were born (however, one started crying when I held him and talked to him.  I think he recognized my voice from telling his mom to do one more rep).  I'm now using Erin's \\"Postnatal exercise\\" DVD and find it very informative for explaining to them that their body needs to go through rehab before we start the more intense exercises.  They both feel they are in better shape after these births than they were with their older children.   I would strongly recommend these DVD's to any expectant mother that wants to keep exercising through their pregnancy.
B001Q7JD5O|2.0|At 3 hours plus, you go in wondering just what it is that is going to take up that much time. In the end, it's Naomi Watts's face. It's a pretty face, but there are entire scenes dedicated to her making soulful eyes at Kong, and getting the same in return. It's overdone to the point of near creepiness. They hammered at it until you start to wonder if the heroine has, well, certain issues.    There are high points. The \\"traffic pileup\\" of dinosaurs has to be seen to be believed, and the scene with Kong on ice managed to be genuinely touching and funny. Somewhere in here was a great one and a half hour movie. It just got lost under a vast, idealized, slightly creepy woman/ape relationship.    One warning for adults - the movie is clearly being pitched to kids, and uncritical kids at that. Crank suspension of disbelief to the maximum setting. An example: when they capture Kong, you are naturally wondering how they are going to manage to get Kong on a ship, and then have the ship survive with an angry Kong inside it for days of voyage. You're anticipating dramatic scenes. Forget it: the movie answers this by just skipping the whole question; the next scene is in New York. In the frantic rush to make Social Commentary (and/or get to the next soulful expression), some wonderful opportunities for genuine storytelling got brushed aside.     If you have kids who like their monsters big and strong, and occasionally repulsive; or someone who gets teary-eyed over what happens to monkeys in China (they get eaten), you might get something out of this. I was just looking for action and adventure, and it had some, but it got, well, Jackson'd to death. The man needs someone to tell him to lay off the melodrama and get to the point.

Also, the bonus materials were worth it for the price.  We especially liked the Evil League of Evil applicants, particularly the first three.    Joss Whedon's stuff is usually so good that I'm willing to pay for it just to encourage him to do more!

0307454541|5.0|As Mikael Blomkvist journalistic career goes up in tatters, he has the opportunity to regain his esteemed name - however, he has to research a four decade unsolved mystery relating to a disappearance.<br /><br />With the help of Lisbeth Salander, they gradually uncover a tale of corruption and deprivation relating to the whole incedent while at the same time Mikael begins to delve into the history of Lisbeth, the tattooed lady.<br /><br />Lisbeth is an enigma; she looks frail and helpless, but below her tattooed exterior lies a strength that is surprising; her sense of right and wrong is profound, and perhaps due to being one of the `abused' in life, she despises anyone who misuses power.<br /><br />Blomkvist and Lisbeth are a very strange pair, but somehow together they make a strong investigative force, and it is the intricacies of their relationship, and the way in which they tackle problems that sets them aside from the normal `Sherlock Holmes' type investigator.<br /><br />This book really delves into seedy side of life and at times is very graphic in nature; having said that, the context in which this seediness is used is perfect, and makes the book very compelling and thoughtful. The book really does a good job of looking into the characters, delving into their psyche and leaving nothing untouched.<br /><br />It is a very challenging book,  but in a good way - it really makes you think about the reality of life....

B000065V9Y|1.0|A lot of people erroneously believe that Peter Gabriel is more artistic than his successor in Genesis (the incomparable small and bald Phil Collins). It's probably not all that unusual to mistake weirdness for artistic and weird he definitely was. Up until \\"So\\" and his newfound commercial success by virtue of the egregious \\"Sledgehammer\\", a track filled with enough dull-witted, lame sexual euphemisims to make Foreigner blush. He obviously liked the feel a little more weight in his pocket and so he chose to retrace the awkward, fumbling steps that produced \\"So\\" yet again.    It was a six year hiatus between \\"So\\" and \\"Us\\" and one would think that if nothing else PG would have come up with at least one or two new ideas, but it's obvious this guy was aiming to produce a carbon copy of \\"So\\" for what we must imgaine to be purely financial purposes.    \\"Steam\\" and \\"Kiss that Frog\\" pair up to form a vile, horrid kind of musical equivalent of siamese twins and in doing so, become the mirror image of \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Big Time\\". Granted the lyrical content is different to each pair, but musically, the horns, dancey feel, and vapid pop are all the same side of the same nasty beast. The listener would not be surprised to learn that all were released as singles.    The whining duet with a female singer past her sell by date is repeated again. \\"Blood of Eden\\" with Sinead O'Connor is not as wretched as \\"Don't Give Up\\" lyrically, but O'Connor would be a downgrade from one of the Spice Girls, let alone Kate Bush.    \\"Come Talk To Me\\" is a desperate plea for communication leaving one with the  suspicion that Gabriel finds himself ignored or avoided quite a lot of the time, which really needs no further elucidation as to the probable reasons why. This track is utterly unconvincing as it ineptly attempts to be the album's \\"In Your Eyes\\". Another by now obligatory yearn fest from Gabriel fails to leave the listener sharing Gabriel's pain, merely the experience of having to listen to it for over seven minutes. The live performance of this on the dvd was really laughably bad. Gabriel looking a bit like some kind of lascivious pervert dialing 900 numbers in a mock phone booth. At the end of the performance, he reached his hand out to the female singer Paula Cole (who had her back turned and appropriately seemed to ignore him) in a weird way and appeared to be striving to hit a very earnest, emotional response from the audience. Few performers do this so often so badly. On an aside, Cole who was totally unknown at the time of the Secret World tour, went on to eclipse Gabriel commercially by a long shot which must have really grated his nerves. He never could match Baldilocks Collins and now he was being usurped by his underlings.    \\"Digging in the Dirt\\" tries hard to salvage a very poorly conceived album and although it has something going for it both lyrically and musically, it learns the hard lesson that one ripe apple can't save the whole rotten bunch. It's the album's \\"Red Rain\\" and they both establish that Gabriel is capable of writing good songs it's just that it only happens once every six years.

As an incoming senior in college, I was looking for some credible knowledge on how to handle my money so that I may one day secure an early retirement.  Obviously I can not yet tell if this book has helped me do that, but it does offer some very good and simple tips that anybody can follow in order to gain financial stability.

0385340575|4.0|\\"Gone Tomorrow\\" is the thirteenth novel in the Jack Reacher series and this one opens in a subway car in New York City. There are five passengers in the subway car with Jack and only one of them gives him any cause for concern. Twenty years ago when Jack was in detached duty with an Israeli army captain he learned the list of suicide bomber characteristics. The female passenger he is watching fits every single one of them.<br /><br />But, Susan Mark, that female passenger was not a suicide bomber. Moments after Jack started talking to her, she pulled a gun and quickly committed suicide. According to one of the detectives who came to the resulting crime scene, Jack pushed her to do it by approaching her. Maybe he did. Or maybe, something or someone else caused it.<br /><br />As long time readers know, once involved in something Reacher isn't going to let it go until he decides it is over. A succession of suits from various governmental agencies arrive to ensure the cooperation of the NYPD, Jack, and anyone else involved. The bad guys have other ideas. With all of these people involved and telling Reacher to go home and forget about it, once knows that Reacher is just going to keep pushing with violent repercussions for everyone.<br /><br />This latest Reacher novel is another good one despite the author's need to constantly remind the readers of the freedoms lost in the wake of 9/11 tragedies. A drum that he has beat before to great effect and does tone down some in this novel while making the same points he has in recent novels. Much of the storyline is back dropped against the modern scourge of Al Quada and the fact that at one time they were our friends when they were fighting the Russians in the eighties. As he has done before, Lee Child has taken current political events and dropped Jack into the thick of a part of it.<br /><br />While Reacher was always a taciturn fellow, he seems to be even more withdrawn in this book. Dialogue as a result is limited with most of the prose concerning action scenes or scenes where Reacher contemplates events while riding subway cars and trains or standing outside of various locations.  As in the recent reads, he once again befriends a member of local Law Enforcement and before the final epic battle, spends some quality private time with her.<br /><br />Oh, the sacrifices one must make for his country.<br /><br />Still this is one of the better Reacher novels of recent memory. \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" is full of misdirection while moving forward at a rapid pace and only features one rather ridiculous plot coincidence. Though, as recent real world history has shown, just about anything is possible.<br /><br />Kevin R.

B000F3T7RE|5.0|This 5-CD set was recorded in live performances in front of remarkably quiet audiences. The Emerson Quartet play with both drive and precision. Although their playing is precise and technically brilliant, I find nothing sterile about their approach to this music. They do not drag the music out, nor do they exaggerate dynamics, but they play it with consummate skill and grace, and with enough enthusiasm for the music to let it speak for itself. By comparison, even the old Fitzwilliam set, so exciting when it was first released, and still a remarkable value, seems a bit ponderous at times, a bit too calculated and measured.<br /> One of my favorite things about the Emerson performances is that the four voices always seem to be equal, and of one mind--the very essence of superb musicianship for a string quartet, and the result in this case of excellent musicianship combined with sympathetic engineering. The recordings were made at live performances, with a really quiet audience. What I find remarkable is the way the engineers have been able to produce such a nice balance in the sound. You can hear the individual instruments, but the sound still has a blend to it, rather than sounding more clinical than life, as some studio recordings of quartets can sound. Still, the recording is rather close, and you can picture the four instruments spread across the soundstage, but for a close recording, there ins not as much extraneous noise as you might expect--bowings and scrapings and gruntings and the like. There is not too much hall sound, but yet the effect is not one of sterility. The sound is close, but not stifling. In all, this stands as an excellent recording job under what could easily have been difficult circumstances.<br /><br /> Yes, this is a most remarkable recording of most remarkable music. Shostakovitch's symphonies can grow tiring after a while, but his quartets have withstood the test of time and repeated listening. Those on a tight budget will get good value from the Naxos set; for about the same price, the Fitzwilliam boxed set (6 CDs) has the advantage over the Naxos of presenting the quartets in order. But for those seeking the ultimate boxed set of these remarkable quartets, this remarkable new release from DG is my first recommendation. It is a winner in every way.os set; for about the same price, the Fitzwilliam boxed set (6 CDs) has the advantage over the Naxos of presenting the quartets in order.

031606792X|1.0|Let me precede this review by stating, &#34;I'm a huge nerdy fan of Twilight, and I will be one of those standing in line hours before New Moon comes out to theaters. I own all the books as well as ridiculous fan paraphernalia from the films and books.&#34;  Breaking Dawn was campy, disorganized, ridiculous, and disappointing. It lacked depth, character development, conflict, and involvement. The characters acted unlike themselves and were distant and removed from each other. Whatever ties held Bella and Edward's strange yet alluring relationship together vanished. They became unlikable and 2 dimensional.   While there were fleeting moments of disappointment with the first 3 books in the series, I found myself actually in agony, my brain melting out through my ears, while reading the 4th book. The story is banal and became repetitive, predictable, and boring after first few chapters. Since the 4th installment in the series was already irreparably ruined by the 2nd chapter, Meyers continues on her rampage unabated. MISSION: Ruin everything the fans held dear about each character.  Each chapter is a greater strain than the preceding one, until the final, culminating, grand finale...sweet payoff, please...  &#34;And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever.&#34;  B O R I N G  I will re-read books 1-3 in hopes I can forget that 4 ever happened.  Seriously - what's up with &#34;Holy Crow!&#34; What the hell, Meyer. It's like spitting in my eye.   Also: RENESME CARLIE? A trashy, unoriginal mashup of four names. WTF?
B0026NWBY2|4.0|Perhaps the most important issue with this release is being missed in all the reviews. This is probably the only viable signpost, for the quality of the pending Beatles remasters. If that is true, then it bodes well for the audio quality we may finally get of the Beatles catalogue. The overall audio quality here is excellent. Anyone can argue the tune selection. My personal favorite Living In The Material World only gets one song, I would have loved Be Here Now on this collection. Conversely I could live with never hearing Crackerbox Palace again (or having ever heard it at all).  Likewise I liked Brainwashed but find Rising Sun a bit tedious.     The sound is excellent and hey look no mono versus stereo mix issues.... come on like they haven't milked the catalogue enough or could not fit the very short early albums with mono mixes available on the same disc as the stereo mixes. Guess somebody has to cover Paul's pegleg tab and Yoko's never ending greed.

B00127RAJY|5.0|The other reviews aren't lying-- this is a butt kicker!!  But that's exactly what i was looking for- A really intense workout that i can actually do in about 20 minutes while my baby naps.  I LOVE that there are 3 different workouts.  I LOVE that each is broken up into 3 circuits.  I LOVE that each circuit has strength, cardio, and abs, and i LOVE that you are never doing more than 45- 60 seconds of any one excersise at a time.  This truly makes it so easy to stick to- just when you think you might be getting tired, you move on.  I And i also cannot believe that such SIMPLE moves are so killer.  I love that she doesn't waste a lot of time showing you how to do each move, she just sort of names the move and then starts it- so you're not standing there waiting.  This makes it go by really quickly!  But NONE of the moves are complicated at all.  They are very simple but TOUGH!  I got through workout 1, and then started 2 and I am still sore!  But in a good way.. i'm feeling muscles i haven't felt in a long time.  I actually alternate doing this video one day and in between- running on the treadmill.  It gives my muscles a little time to recover and i'm less sore.  I can already tell i am toning up again while trying to lose this baby weight.  (Now if I could just stay off the sweets!)  Anyway, I don't think anyone can go wrong with this.  Even if you are very overweight, you can do this.. it's simple, simple, simple, but as tough as you want to make it.  You can always do the modified (easier) moves that they show and still get and awesome workout.  I am loving this DVD and bet i will be doing it for years!!!  My only gripe is a small one- you can't fast forward through the beginning intro and such, so I just start the DVD while I get my workout clothes on, and when I'm ready, the workouts are queued up to begin.  BEST workout video i've ever done!

B000A0GYD2|5.0|Tom Hanks put together an excellent series on NASA's Apollo Space Program. It's rare when a documentary feels like a top Hollywood movie. Every part meets the quality standards of the others. It's also rare when Hollywood takes the time to tell a story right--letting the pace slow a little, so we can catch the social and emotional nuances of the story as well.    My family is watching these one at a time on Friday nights. We're asking our four kids questions about what we're watching, so it's a good family learning experience. We highly recommend this series. It takes in enough of American culture in the 1960s to make for a good history lesson.

B000MQC9H4|3.0|I don't recall ever hearing the name of Nancy Meyers before.  Yet she took a lot on in this production, with both the writing and directing duties.  My feeling is that she is an unusually talented writer, a decent director, and a below-average casting director.<br /><br />Set in LA and England, Amanda Woods (Diaz) and Miles (Black) work together putting together movie trailers.  Woods breaks up with her boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) after she finds out he had an affair.  Miles is in a relationship with a seemingly more stable girlfriend Maggie, who turns out to not be so stable.  Meanwhile, in London, Iris Simpkins (Winslet) has been carrying on a three-year, one-sided affair with co-worker Jasper (Rufus Sewell), while her brother Graham (Jude Law) is busy editing books.  Iris finds out Jasper is engaged with a girl in the circulation department, and has her heart crushed in front of all of her co-workers.  Amanda and Iris are ready for a change.  That comes when they agree to switch houses for the Christmas holiday.<br /><br />In any movie, things have to be believable.  That of course can be stretched in, say, a science fiction movie because we know there is no such thing as time travel, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, and there are (unfortunately) no monsters on Mars waiting to attack us as soon as we set foot there.<br /><br />But in a movie such as 'The Holiday', the arc of the relationships have to work, because the whole movie is ABOUT the relationships!  The sumptuous look of the film isn't matched by the casting choices.  In the DVD special feature, writer/director Meyers says she 'loves' Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet and Jack Black.  Well, who doesn't?  At least in individual roles they really fit in.  I loved Jack Black in School of Rock.  He was just perfect.  Here, he isn't.  There is zero chemistry between the staid Winslet, who plays a newspaper reporter in London's Daily Telegraph, and Black, who is back to his music by portraying a composer for the movies and movie trailers.  Try as he might, Black just doesn't fit well with Winslet at all.<br /><br />The other pairing in the film, Diaz with Jude Law is equally unbelievable.  Diaz, in the Meg Ryan role (ditsy blonde, long in heart and cutesy) had nothing in common with the down-to-earth Law.  They just don't fit, and you don't believe for a minute that these two could really end up together.<br /><br />Ironically, if the male leads were switched, the chemistry might actually work, especially with the non-manic Winslet and the equally settled Law.  The potential match between Black and Diaz might be a bit less convincing, because, let's face it, Diaz is a major beauty, and Black is always ruffled, no matter how often is shirt and pants are ironed.  Still, you could see it.<br /><br />But you just NEVER buy the pairing as put forth in this film.<br /><br />I must comment, however, on the sparkling writing of Ms. Meyers.  This woman can write dialog with the best I've run across in the past decade.  Her writing is such that you notice how excellent it is, and you make a point of find out who came up with this.  There's one scene with Jude Law talking to Diaz about how to make their relationship work that has pacing, inflection, cadence and lyrical tone that is just outstanding.<br /><br />Oh, and a note about Eli Wallach, who turned 90 during the filming.  His character (Aurthur Abbott) is sweet and light-hearted and wonderful.  He plays a writer (I suspect Meyers chose that career because of her own talents) who has won many awards, but 'hasn't been busy since 1978'. Iris (Winslet) finds out that the Hollywood community wants to honor a lifetime of writing, but he doesn't want to go.  Winslet convinces him to go, and Abbott finds out that many haven't forgotten about him after all.  Not to put a fine point on it, but the Winslet-Wallach pairing DOES have chemistry.  Their personalities mesh with a 50 year age difference better that theputative pairings of the film.<br /><br />Over all, three stars.  One star only for the casting.  Terrible, and it ruins the film.  Five stars for the writing.  Four stars for the actors when they are not with their supposed 'magical matches'.  Two stars for Black and Diaz when they are with Winslet and Law, and four stars for acting for Winslet and Law with they are with their 'mates'.  Simply, they are more talented actors/actresses.<br /><br />It's sad this is such a miss because of the casting.  With believable pairing, this could have been special.  The worst choice? Diaz.  There doesn't seem to be much heart in that girl at all.  She comes across as all surface.  I didn't like her in the role at all.  Poor choice.ne star only for the casting.

Based on the book by John Buchan and directed by Alfred Hitchcock this is the story of a man falsely accused of murder who escapes and tries to find the real murderer. Full of action, suspense, spys, and plot twists this is Hitchcock at his best. Stars Robert Donat as the accused and Madeleine Carrol as the woman who helps him. Great story and plot. Well worth watching. Criterion is the best when it comes to restoring old films.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|This is a great album. Most reviewers give it 5 stars and it deserves every one of them. However, do yourself a favor. Avoid the remixed, remastered and expanded version. The remastering is not good. It is harsh and hard to listen to. Seek out the original version with 8 cuts. It is the original mix and is much better. The remastered version overamps everything with the end result that it is almost painful to listen to. Why someone felt it was necessary to \\"improve\\" on what most critics consider a masterpiece is beyond me! Trust me on this one - I have both versions and have just played them one after the other.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|Synopsis:  The film follows a dysfunctional family living in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The mother Sheryl (Toni Collette) is in her second marriage and is becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of solid financial support coming into the family.  Her husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) is an aspiring motivational speaker who only sees things as a win or a loss, with no middle ground in between (and this puts a serious strain on his relationships, personal and professional.)  Her son Dwayne (Paul Dano), who was from the previous marriage, is a angst-ridden teenager who has taken a vow of silence under the guise of wanting to become a test pilot, but most signs indicate he just hates his family.  Her seven-year-old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a chubby little girl who aspires to be a beauty queen after being a runner-up in a local pageant.  They live with  Richard's foulmouthed father Edwin (Alan Arkin), who was evicted from a retirement home for snorting heroin, while the family gave temporary residence to her brother Frank (Steve Carell), who is a homosexual Proust scholar (the best in the country according to him) after he attempted suicide when a rival took both his spotlight and love interest. Well, the winner of the pageant that Olive came second in was unable to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, so as the runner-up Olive, by default, must now go and compete.  Wishing to realize Olive's dream, but not having a lot of money themselves, the family decides to drive to California in an old VW Bus so that Olive can compete in the pageant.  While Richard tries to make himself believe otherwise, everything starts to fall apart while they're on the road, forcing him to realize that maybe he's not quite the winner he makes it out to be.  Will Richard finally see the value in trying as opposed to \\"just winning?\\"  Will Dwayne wish to stop hating his family and reintegrate into the group?  Will Olive win the pageant?  Can Frank overcome his attempt and see the value in life?  What will happen to Edwin and his heroin habit?  And for the love of mercy, will poor Sheryl manage to keep it together?!    You know, I really felt bad for Sheryl in this film.  She put up with so much nonsense and tried to fight through all of it with a smile, no matter how hard or taxing it was on her.  But really, this whole thing was about making lemonade out of lemons, and the big yellow bus that's old and falling apart is just a perfect analogy to all of that.  The film was unfortunate and sad at times, but you walked away with the lesson that sometimes, it's not about winning or losing but whether or not you even went up to bat to begin with.  Mix in solid acting, great direction, and a wonderful soundtrack by DeVotchKa and you've got a movie that's worth the acclaims it's received.    I recommend this movie to all movie fans.  Go check it out.

0061148512|5.0|Probably the thing that scares me the most about this book is how much I relate to Esther, the brilliantly mad heroine. Of course, it's not her brilliance to which I relate, but her madness. Sylvia Plath indeed makes Esther's breakdown seem like the most reasonable thing in the world. Esther is battered left and right by people's expectations of her, as a woman and as a writer. All of these expectations are burdens, weighing her down until she finally falls into a dark hole. It's 1953, and for a woman who wants to define her life by her work and her mind, the pressures of marriage and womanhood are immense. Esther is surrounded by talented girls who want nothing more than a rich husband and children. Esther doesn't fit into that mold, and she is unable to create her own.<br /><br />Sylvia Plath uses the story of a fig tree to illustrate how Esther sees the many different possible paths in her life. One fig is the talented poet, another is the doting wife and mother, and another is the powerful editor....it goes on and on. Many people have struggled with the same thing. Esther feels pulled in many different directions (as do I). Her descent into madness throws a wrench into her plans, forcing her to deal with the imperfect person she really is. Plath uses an almost causal tone when describing Esther's breakdown. Everything is stated matter-of-factly, demonstrating how even the mentally ill can think rationally.<br /><br />The book deserves its place among the best of the American classics. Plath was a literary genius whose own struggles with mental illness gave her poetry and prose a tragic and haunting voice.
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|\\"Mamma Mia\\" boasts an all-star cast and fantastic music by ABBA, but it doesn't rank as one of my favorite movie musicals of all time. The story revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a 20-year-old girl about to tie the knot on the beautiful island she resides on with her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep). Sophie has no idea who who father is (neither does Donna, for that matter), so she invites the three possible candidates (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgard) to her wedding in hopes of reuniting with her true paterfamilias. Needless to say, Donna isn't exactly thrilled when three of her former lovers show up unexpectedly on the eve of her daughter's wedding, and of course hilarious hijinks ensue, followed by a totally unrealistic yet ridiculously happy ending.<br /><br />The best part of this film is watching some of my favorite Hollywood actors sing and dance like crazy. Some of them (Streep, Seyfried, Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters) are quite impressive, while others (pretty much all of the guys) are not. Also, I have no idea where this movie was filmed, but it's absolutely gorgeous and I totally want to go there!<br /><br />Overall, \\"Mamma Mia\\" is a fun little movie to watch, although I doubt I'll ever watch it again.
B0000TB014|5.0|OK, so I must admit, when Michael passed, my kids said, \\"who is he anyway?\\"  Well I decided to show them.  After the video and CD arrived we sat and watched it and now my 3 kids love Michael Jackson, they each have different favorite songs.  They have looked into other CD's.  They love him just like we did growing up.   They watch the video's over and over, like little groupies.  They share with their friends who have no idea who he is.  It is cool to see.

044024238X|5.0|I loved this book.  Yes, unrealistic but isn't that the great thing about fiction! This was the first book I read of Sophia's.  Let me just say hook, line, and sinker.  Every girlfriend I have given a Kinsella book to becomes a Kinsellaholic.  Reading her books in days not weeks. They become desperate for another fix of Kinsella. All her books are easy reads and very funny.  If I come across a friend who is down in the dumps I prescribe them 10cc of Kinsella and voila the blues are gone.  The only downside is now they are a Kinsellaholic and will need another fix as soon as the last page is turned.  I should know, Hi my name is Marion and I am a Kinsellaholic.
B0008ENICU|5.0|What a movie classic!  Charming, funny, heart-warming movie full of beautiful talented actresses.  The clothes, hairstyles, furniture, cars, etc. also make the movie worth the trip back in time.  The writing and direction live up to the high quality standards of the movies produced in that era. 1939--the best year ever for movies!!

B0015OKWL2|5.0|Al Pacino and De Niro are great in this film. I did not think the plot was predictable at all. See the entire movie before making opinions and you'll be in for a realistic crime thriller with a welcoming twist. The filming and camera work is nicely done. 5 stars is given due to the vast majority of low ratings. This movie is much better than 88 Minutes (also with Al Pacino). Definite rent if you like the genre or the actors.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This CD is awesome and I have enjoyed it so much his music is so inspiring to me. He has talent no one else will ever possess and the music on the CD shows it. I am truly devastated over the loss of MJ I am still crying about it.  He will live in my heart forever.  I only wish the negative people would have known the real MJ. Listen to his words, look at his various videos on the web in regards to children, read the court transcripts and read the book on his conspiracy.  You will know why he was acquitted because he was totally innocent from day one and every juror knew it.  God Bless his beautiful children.  I am looking forward to the day his children are older and they give an interview on what a wonderful \\"DADDY\\" he was.
0060832819|3.0|Well known for his mystical and enchanting storylines, Paulo Coelho, no doubt, knows how to turn a phrase.  Many of the lines here in THE ZAHIR ring true in the reader's ear, with the deeper meaning of exploring oneself in an inner journey facilitated by the softness of the words.  The book, though, would have been better with less of the words overall.  Coelho meanders a bit too much here, risking putting off the reader who may wish that, whatever path Coelho wants to take us down, he sure could get there a lot more expeditiously. (Yes, I know that that basically undermines what Coelho is about, but I stick by it anyway).    Our main character, an unnamed author, sets off, like the characters in many of Coelho's books, on a journey.  This one is, on the surface, to find his wife who abandoned him unexpectedly and who has now turned into the zahir, an object of intense and unremitting obsession that consumes a person.  The deeper pilgrimage is to find (experience, unleash?) The true nature and power of love.  While the first journey is external, the second, and more important journey, is the one which the author must take within himself.    For both journeys, the author is guided by a strange young Kazakh going by the name of Mikhail.  He know where the author's zahir is but guides the author through the more important journey of understanding love.  Only then will the time be right for the reunion.    Yes, it sounds sappy, and to a large extent it is, often overshadowing any larger, overarching meaning to be gleaned in THE ZAHIR.  More problematic, however, is that the characters often come off as exceptionally shallow and superficial.  The author, the main character who is supposed to be having some epiphany, has been married two or three times before marrying his current wife, the zahir.  He admits to numerous affairs throughout, but downplays them on an emotional level.  While on his search he becomes involved with a woman who falls deeply in love with him, he knows this, yet does not discourage her, breaking her heart at the end.  It was simply difficult to view this character as being the conduit to enlighten me about much.    His current wife, when she re-enters the show, is pregnant with another man's child and admits to having fallen in love after, not before, but after leaving her husband because she thought he needed to find himself.  Wow, if these are the characters we are to emotionally connect with, what are the emotionally immature ones like?    Also, that the main character bears an uncanny resemblance to Paulo Coelho himself, one is constantly thrown a bit off guard by what this character admits.  Maybe Coelho meant that, though.  Alas, I do not know.  Anyway, this book is about Coelho in one way or another.  That alone will get many to read it.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|Id have to agree with evertone who gave this book 5 stars it was amazing and I really enjoyed this book. As soon as I finished this book I had to go and read the next one.
0385342020|3.0|I absolutely love Sophia Kinsella and her writing style.  She's an amazing author so with that said I was very surprised I didn't like this book.  I found it easy to pick up where I left off but unlike most of her books was putting the book down quite a bit.  Funny to read and at times intriguing but it just didn't keep me interested
B000KX891E|2.0|I'm very happy I purchased a second-hand CD of this, for I was not crazy about it. I have been a long-time fan of James Taylor (I mean from when he had a full head of hair.. long time), and am still a huge fan.. his voice is so unique & beautiful. But this was his only CD that I did not like.
0307454541|4.0|Told in third person narration, we follow Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander as they try to solve a forty-year-old crime. The story is intriguing and fast-paced with one of the most remarkable characters I've read in years: Salander. She's a social misfit that still gets the job done (she's like Dr. Spock without the personality). The reader falls in love with her, though in reality, if you were alone in a room with Salander, you'd be totally unnerved and would be compelled to leave. And other characters are also standouts including Blomkvist, Berger, Henrik and Frode because they are multi-faceted with their own unique styles.<br /><br />The dialogue is distinct as well as revealing, and Larsson creates a wonderful landscape. The only problem I had with the book is even though the heroes make sacrifices and give things up in order to solve the mystery, it's a little too rosy at times - the good things happen to good people clich&eacute; is truly exploited.<br /><br />Larsson's third person omniscience also runs into some judgmental problems at times. On occasion, indirect interior monologue does come into play, but it is not distracting. And the usage was cause for an honest laugh here and there.<br /><br />The work is translated from Swedish and adheres to British grammar. Even so, the editor did miss a few glaring errors that were obviously lost in translation.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was a great read and I couldn't put the book down. I never consumed nearly 600 pages so quickly.<br /><br />Larsson has probably presented the most complex mystery I've read to date, yet I was never confused. I also enjoyed his transitions and expositions. Regardless of what he did, Larsson never tripped himself up and the pace of the book never faltered.
B000HM2NS8|2.0|I saw a program on History Channel that referred to the book so I bought it. The book sucked.I was hoping for some more in depth discussion on the topics listed but it didn't give any.
B0000019PA|5.0|I'm consistently amazed that every time I listen to this CD, it never sounds dated, old, tired or lacking.  In fact, I don't even put it on anymore unless I've got a reasonable chance of listening all the way through uninterrupted because I'll simply be annoyed at being torn away from it before the end.<br /><br />Jeff Mangum, seemingly out of simple naive bravado, performs his heart out.  Screeching out lyrics that are nonsensical yet communicative, his melodies are also equal parts quirk and polish.  The fuzz bass that ties the whole thing together makes it move, while the assortment of guitars, harmoniums and horns create the ornamentation.<br /><br />Certainly a master work that is high on invention and low on convention.  As others here have mentioned, this isn't for everyone, but it is dripping with artistic value.

0307341550|5.0|I'm not sure if I'm in love with Gillian Flynn, her protagonist, Camille Preaker or both.    This was an amazingly fast-paced read with exceptional internal/external conflict and tension that never let up. Yes, it's cliché, but this was a real page-turner.    Camille is a smug, overly sarcastic bitch - with a decent heart - and she is completely wounded and damaged. Did I mention that I'm in love with a fictional character? Better still, the first person narration is solid and extremely well written. The work is peppered with phenomenal imagery, metaphors and similes and just wonderful turns of phrase. Furthermore, the dialogue is distinct, purposeful and riveting. In several ways, this reads like a movie script - and it should definitely be made into a film.    I'm truly amazed how Flynn brought the reader such ordinary characters that did not seem ordinary by any means. Each character was well-layered with depth, emotion, strengths and weaknesses - and they were all distinct. There is no chance of reader getting lost in this work or even wondering who is who.    What really got me was that Flynn addressed a pet peeve of mine: Blond is male and blonde is female. I'm sure some readers may have thought they spotted typos, but she's the first author in a long time who has adhered to the French-based masculine and feminine.    What I like the most, however, is that the mystery makes up maybe ten percent of the book, even though it permeates everything. What matters most is Camille, her drive, commitment and her commentary as a reporter going back to her small town to solve a murder.    Without a doubt, this is the best novel I've read in years.    Can you really not go home again? Read this exceptional work to find out.
B000296GVG|5.0|This is one of Johnny Depp's First films and in my opinion one of his best. I love new actors when they are still uncertain about themselves. They give it all they have and still believe it may not be good enough. Well Johnny this is great! Hate to see your innocents fade. He's great as a seductive lover. Wish he would return to this type of movie!
0385341008|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as a summer read.  The various \\"letters\\" made the characters come alive and while the ending was not a surprise, I found the book hard to put down.  The book also covered an area of post WWII history of which I was unfamiliar.
0385338732|5.0|Though the theme is familiar (someone undergoing a transformation in personality because of something that happens, coupled with the ugly duckling transformation/underdog) the book still works because it so well presented and often has you laughing at parts.  In this book the catalyst is Lexi being injured and waking up a couple of years later to find everything has changed, family, friends and her looks.  No longer an ugly duckling she is now pretty.  Of course she needs to try to figure everything out, bth who she was and what she is now.  Great read in the genre and theme.
B001JTIH5Q|5.0|So, you should know upfront that I think most self help books are either rehashes of each other, bunkum, or outlets for self involved personalities to pontificate in order to let the rest of us know he/she is way more advanced than the rest of us (Wayne Dwyer, I really do mean you!) That said, I think this book is a surprising exception. Maybe because it's small and focussed on a few points? Maybe because the ideas are easily grasped and pertinent?  Maybe because the points make sense and pertain to our lives in a practical way? I don't know except that when I began reading it, I immediately thought - this is good stuff.    We, my partner and I,  are reading this bit by bit and discussing it and finding it useable and doable. I've been getting the calendars for a couple of years, and keep finding little gems of wisdom on them - and finally thought \\"maybe I ought to buy the actual book!\\" So I did, as well as the cd's so we can listen together. I like having both so we can underline in the hard copy of the book, but  the cd book is definitely a plus in different way. I strongly suggest this for anyone wanting to take that next step along the way - particularly if you've gotten weary of all the self-designated savants out there.    The only real criticism I have is that the examples Ruiz gives are pretty hokey and so unlikely they actually don't feel like valid examples. Honestly, how many times does someone walk up to you and tell you how bad you look? Or, how terrible your clothes are? In my world, it isn't that often. If it is often in your world, then you REALLY need this book. However, this is a small criticism compared to the worthiness of the book overall.  I  think there's something here for most anyone who is trying to walk through the world in a positive way, and recommend it to those of you who are trying to do that.
B000BMHVSQ|5.0|For TG, a woman of valor.     The exchange between the Count and Jake Barnes in which the Count reveals the secret of staying in love makes \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" one of America's great books.   Ernest Hemingway provided great comfort to those of the post World War I generation vexed by the seemingly unattainable amid growing material plenty. Jake feels inadequate because his war experience has left him unable to do sexually what he used to do. He's wounded by his lack of marriage to Lady Brett Ashley. Along comes the Count to tell Jake in a veiled and thus powerful way - It's not you. It's the situation. In particular it's this noble yet easily corrupted notion that equates love with possession.   Hemingway isn't fulminating against marriage - he was married four times himself. What he's warning against is making love conditional upon possession. Through the Count, the author is telling us if you love somebody then meet them where they are. Marriage is fine as long as it's based on a mutual understanding, not the desire of one to possess another.   It should certainly not be dependent on any physical appearances as the words and actions of the Biblical patriarchs show us - see Genesis 12:11 and 24:57. For a hint of how the economic concept of acquisition has overflowed its banks, see Max Weber's \\"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.\\"   Hemingway's meditation on possession echoes Weber in demonstrating the doctrine's wider social implications. Papa can be viewed as warning his countrymen and future generations about indulging in personal material comforts and the nation's drive for dominance in global affairs.   The personal and national drives are summed up in the character of Robert Cohn. The Jewish Cohn is the embodiment of the emerging new immigrant America. Cohn's failure with Lady Ashley proves the Count correct again.   Hemingway's treatment of love and possession is mirrored in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"The Bridges of Madison County.\\" Jay Gatsby isdestroyed by his desire to acquire Daisy Buchanan (this is the \\"foul dust\\" that F. Scott Fitzgerald foreshadows early in the novel) although he shows himself to be the finest of men by not making his love conditional.   Clint Eastwood's character in the movie version of \\"Bridges\\" (I haven't read the book yet) sums it up well - \\"They're too many lines being drawn. This is mine. This is yours...\\" Yet the lure of rescuing someone from a seemingly bad situation is powerful (see King David's experience with Bathsheva, II Samuel chapters 11 and 12) and activates the acquisition impulse. Eastwood's character is nearly seduced by it. His love pulls him up just as he's about to create strife for Meryl Streep's character.  For more about the difference between possession love and true love contrast the agony of Carly Simon's song \\"You Belong to Me\\" with the serenity of Whitney Houston's \\"I Will Always Love You.\\"  By studying \\"Gatsby\\" and \\"Bridges\\" we recount Hemingway's wise counsel of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" - love and strife don't go together and if you love someone set them free.

1400082773|5.0|My husband read out a few passages from this book and my interest was piqued. I read it over the last couple of days, at a pace normally reserved for racy thriller fiction! Obama tells his story eloquently, and without trying hard - and boy, what a story he has to tell! I'm sure there are thousands of people of all races with a rich, exotic background such as his, and have similarly searched for themselves and their roots. But Obama has a wonderful ability to bring these things together within a larger context - of Black America, the economic and social and cultural class struggles, of Indonesia, of Kenya and its tribes, of Africans in America, of Africans in Africa...<br /><br />This book describes a very personal quest for one man's roots, a reason and purpose for his life, but with a difference - he not only describes his own reasons, dreams, perspective, but a variety of the other characters' points of view. He has made a genuine effort to understand where people are coming from - irrespective of race, color, religion. Even describing some negative aspects of some people, he bothers to go back a little way and discover the reasons behind their bitterness, pettiness, false bravado, whatever... A very non-judgmental attitude, which obviously makes for a great leader, a great human being.<br /><br />He has certainly achieved a memoir with neither a negative nor a positive spin on people and events - he simply chronicles them as he experienced them, as he heard them. For all that, it is not neutral or wishy-washy - opinions are clearly expressed, both his own, and the other characters'. Reading about his childhood, and description of his mother and maternal grandparents, my first thought was \\"Wow! He must be really close to them to write about them like this!\\" (Surely it was all written with their consent and approval). I also liked the parts he left unsaid (mainly gathered from subtle hints of his dating life), protecting the privacy of the women he dated.<br /><br />The other thing about the book is, at all times his own achievements and opinions are nicely understated. You get the impression of a very unassuming man who has traveled a lot since childhood, seen and accepted realities stripped of pretenses. The book is all the more charming as it doesn't seem to show or imply any higher political aspirations.<br /><br />He has an excellent way with words, the ability to make every sentence, every word count. I found the writing so moving, that in some parts, I had tears streaming down my face (causing the cat and my children to look at me quizzically!).

0452295548|3.0|While the massage in the book is fine, the account and the information is basic, simple and overplayed. Everything I got from the book was explained to me in Taylor's 30-minute spotlight on Oprah.    In the chapter, \\"The morning of the stroke\\", the reader is presented with an account of events leading up to her dibilitation. It seems as if Taylor dind't have enough to write about, so she repeats thoughts and aspects of her account over and over again. This became very frustrating.    Secondly, I know she lost everything she ever knew after her stroke, but the language and sentence structure was that of an 8th grader's. She seems to have a decent vocabulary, but the sentence structure is so redundant: \\"this happened and I became worried\\", \\"that happened and I felt happy\\".    It's like reading a story book. There's a diagram of a brain (p. 37) with the caption \\"Jill's hemorrhage began deep inside here!\\"   I could not stop staring at that caption, was the exclamation point really necessary? It felt like I was reading a powerpoint my aunt had composed. Much of the book's credibility was forfeited with that simple diagram.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I wanted to wait after I got through the program to write my opine.  I didn't do the program consistently, so it took me approximately 45 days to get through the 30-day cycle.  Here's what I found:<br /><br />With proper dedication the routines will help you a lot.  But if you are not in active shape (that is, doing something aerobic at least every other day) you will find it's very hard in the beginning.  I used to be an avid runner but stopped a year ago due to moving, a new job, and basically a new life.  The first day I couldn't even finish all the reps in the level 1.  Despite this I was sore for three days and couldn't attempt to do it again until day four.  This is a point where most people would be too discouraged or annoyed at the stiffness to continue.  Don't stop just because the first day is hard (and is usually the hardest), as Jillian says in the video \\"if you want change, it's not coming for free\\".<br /><br />I was able to start doing level 1 every day after a week of on/off trying.  It's full impact, so in 22 minutes she squeezes in a lot of activity.  After a week of level 1 I noticed subtle definition in my stomach, my arms were significantly more toned (but I still hate push ups), and my quads were tighter.  I blended level 1 with 2 so I could ease into the cycles (completed level 1 and moved on to the first round of circuits of level 2).  Overall I lost ten pounds, it might've been more had it not been for the muscle gain.  But I love how I look now, and it's still a struggle to want to work out every day (I really, really dislike it) but with the results comes maintenance.<br /><br />If you are a beginner or just getting back into working out and trying to decide between this and her Blast Fat, Boost Metabolism choose this.  It is much easier to get through and far less demanding off the bat.  I have her BFBM and it involves some serious athleticism gained from her 30 day shred.  You might be sore from the 30 day shred, but if you try BFBM first you will feel like you're going to die.re going to die.
B001TODCII|3.0|I guess that I was under the impression from the previews on TV that his daughter was being taken because he was an ex-spy perhaps by old enemies with a grudge. So I was VERY disappointed to see the reason why they kidnapped her. Yes, I understand that is a real problem in this world but I would've liked to have seen spies after him. There were \\"edge of your seat\\" moments but not enough to make me want to watch the movie again. I'd rather give it 2 1/2 stars but that's not on the menu so to speak. I also have to agree with another reviewer on the unbelievable moments at times. As old as he is jumping & landing on concrete, etc. without injury time after time is a bit far fetched.
B0019LY5I2|3.0|What I like about this movie is that everyone at least tries hard and that the movie is some fun. While the script is decent and tries as much as possible to explain why this person or that person are holding a grudge with each other through many flashbacks. The movie is better than you'd expect and it at least is less disappointing than some of the other movies to be released this summer. It delivers more than the summer movies that I expected to be a lot better than they were.<br /><br />  It has a very big cast and Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Van Helsing) does a fine job giving everyone a good amount of screen time. He gets trash talked about him, but he's honestly better than Michael Bay and McG are at least. One problem I had was Joseph Gordon Levitt (Brick,The Lookout) being cast against type as Cobra Commander. It worked for Heath Ledger as the Joker, but doesn't work here. He's a very talented actor and tries hard to be sinister and it does almost work but I also had a hard time trying not to laugh. I just don't see why he has been cast in villains roles of late.<br /><br />  But the best casting was of Ray Park (X-Men, Sleepy Hollow) as Snake Eyes. He was perfectly cast in the role and the movie is it's most fun when he's on screen. The movie could have been a lot worse, someone only yelled \\"Yo Joe!\\" once and none of the bad guys ever yelled \\"COBRA!!!\\". Still, it would have been better if Marlon Wayans took a vow of silence like Snake Eyes.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Diana Krall is a good artist and performer, but the songs she is more capable to sing are jazz standard, as she does in her best albums (\\"The look of love\\", \\"When I look in your eyes\\" and \\"All for you\\"); bossa nova standards have nothing to do with her music and with anything she has done in the past.   Forget this album.
0380973839|4.0|These tales represent quite an imaginative collection of storytelling by Bradbury. The Martian Chronicles is a series of short stories which loosely interlink and tell of Man's arrival to Mars in the distant year of 1999 (Bradbury wrote book in 1941), with the stories continuing on chronologically until the year 2026. They depict Man's behaviors and emotions as humans make discoveries on the planet. Within the stories are human interactions with the Martians, and the subsequent problems they create when they try to project their culture onto the new land. While many of the stories are told from Man's point of view, one consistent theme is Man's ignorance to his new surroundings.     The stories have an ironic, underlying spooky approach to them; they don't really reach out and grab you, but they slightly get under your skin enough to make you feel uncomfortable. Evident within the tales is a Twilight Zone-like feel, where you are given some irregular settings and conflicts, and sometimes slight twists at the conclusion. Most of all, these stories make you think about existence, and the possibilities, and man's sometimes overzealous nature with exploration.      Here are some of the stories in the collection, and a quick synopsis:     \\"The Third Expedition\\"-- a group of explorers led by Captain Black arrive on Mars only to find that it looks like their old home town and is inhabited by friends and family from the past. While many of his shipmates are thrilled with joy to see their loved ones, Black is cautious and skeptical about what is happening, believing this too good to be true.     \\"The Silent Towns\\"--A man, Walter Gripp, seems to be the only one left on the planet. He seeks everywhere to find someone, anyone, but it seems that fate will leave him isolated. That is, until he finds one woman, Genevieve, to talk to. However, he realizes there is a twist to finding the only person left, it seems...    \\"Usher II\\"--This tale pays homage to great literary writing, especially Edgar Allan Poe. A man, Stenghal, builds a macabre house, which he dubs The House of Usher. Stenghal has built the house as sort of a tribute to all literary legends and the classics of the past, but with stuffed animals, and other bizarre features, it is straight out Poe's \\"The Fall of the House of Usher.\\" Literature and books have been extinguished, as have many other forms of entertainment, such as films. A man comes to tear down the house, and to report Stenghal, but slowly finds himself in the middle of an Edgar Allan Poe story.     \\"The Long Years\\" - Captain Wilder and his crew come to the red planet to find Mr. Hathaway and his family alone. Wilder notices something out of place about Hathaway's wife and kids--they haven't aged! He sends one of his crewmembers to find out what the truth is.     \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\"--A haunting isolation has crept over the planet. Although a house's appliances and mechanisms live on--- the clock ticks, the alarm sounds, a mechanical voice is overhead--the house is, in fact, lifeless. This is a story that is quite apocalyptical in its setting, and seems to depict the destruction forces of humanity...    \\"The Million Years Picnic\\"--This is the final story in the book, and tries to tie all of man's encounters and lessons together. A family appears to be headed towards a picnic as they pass the desolate, dead towns of the planet, but the father reveals his true reasons for taking his family on the excursion, and reveals the truth of the Earth's destruction. The story is a commentary on starting over.     Over all, a worthwhile collection of stories, and definitely a must for science fiction or Bradbury fans.
B0017TWUZG|1.0|I bought this thinking I would be able to upgrade to Blu-ray on my computer which did not have that capability. However, I found it unbelievably complicated due to the 3-4 step process to do so. I then cancelled the process & the $99 charge. So I have not reviewed this movie in Blu-ray.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Julia's Paris in 1949 against Julie's Queens of 2002, the related lives of two women rolled onward being at times funny, romantic, emotional, scenic, and endearing. Julie and Julia face a milestone in life, one being a mid-lifer with nothing to accomplish, and one facing age 30 with an unproductive career.<br /><br />Meryl Streep as Julia Child is fantastic as the older of the pair. As fun an believable playing fun-loving Julia as her role in \\"Mama Mia.\\" She forges ahead, unafraid, into the domain of french chefs. A food publication becomes her goal. Julie Powell (Amy Adams--Night at the Museum) challenges herself to cooking all recipes in Child's French book, within a year, and blogging the experience, while working a full-time job, and keeping her hubby, Eric, happy in the apartment over the Pizza shop.<br /><br />Julie and Julia keep the husbands happy. Paul Child played by Stanley Tucci (The Terminal, Devil Wears Prada), is a delight to watch. Both Julia and Julie are amorous enough for any man's pleasure. Just what did J.Child mean when she stated \\"everything's better with butter?\\" Julie and Julia is not R-rated, but fun, realistic, healthy-marriage style romance. Applause, applause!<br /><br />The couples are almost always working together, reaching for an achievement of the wife's choosing, husbands being faithful and encouraging. Not the typical Hollywood plot or agenda, and because of the humorous treatment of the dialogue, this romantic element keeps the film from becoming a \\"chic flick\\".<br /><br />So what's so good, deserving 5 sugar-glazed stars? Relationships sustained out of mutual admiration, communication, trust, and marital united fronts. What a unique recipe for a fantastic movie coming from Hollywood in the 21st century. The story this mix of cast and ingredients cooked up is worthy of any RECIPE BOOK or romantic/comedy.<br /><br />FOOD. Any story about Julia Child must include food. \\"Julie and Julia\\" will leave you heading for the nearest restaurant. Delicious looking food. Recipes should be on DVD inserts. The props department should win awards. The clean-up crew likely gained many pounds.<br /><br />A highly recommended movie from someone and his wife beyond middle age. Should also delight the 30-somethings.  I Loved this movie. I feel pleasantly fuller by at least 25 pounds.ould be on DVD inserts. The props department should win awards.

B00000GAIW|5.0|Aqualung - (1971) 17 Tracks (6 bonus) (75:30)  *****<br /><br />This album is without a doubt a Classic.  Practically everyone should be familiar with the opening track, as it was an FM Rock station staple.  This album veered pretty far off course from the band's past, mostly acoustic Folk Rock sound, as it is full of huge electric guitar riffs.  But, Mr. Anderson's flute is ever present, along with plenty of acoustic guitars in a few places.  One of the reasons this is the most popular of Jethro Tull's albums is how much the thing Rocks from one end to the other.  From the opening riffs of Aqualung to the rollickin' ending of Wind Up, which led to all the exposure some of the tracks got on many mainstream FM radio stations.  Simply put, this is one of those albums everybody should own.  Of course, its popularity can also be its downfall.  Many people are just tired of hearing these songs and are simply burned out on it (critics of Dark Side of the Moon say the same thing).  But, if you are not familiar with the album, I highly recommend it for your listening pleasure.<br /><br />Bonus tracks: Lick Your Fingers Clean is a nice rockin' number that fits right in with the style of Aqualung.  Also included is an alternative version of Wind Up and a 14 minute interview with Ian Anderson. The last three songs, Songs for Jeffrey, Fat Man, and Bouree were recorded live for a BBC program and feature a rare lead vocal performance by Jeffrey Hammond.
B001FB4W16|1.0|I purchased this series and the 2nd disk was broken had to go out and rent the disk to finish the series was very disappointed
B001V9LRV0|2.0|This DVD(s) was a disappointment in terms of selection. Only one song by Janis. No real songs by Crosby-Stills-Nash that were seen, only heard. A lot of the background stories are interesting. I agree that it does take you back to a time that will never return, which is sad.
B00000IREA|4.0|Total sixties cheese, but a true cult classic (with benefits) IMHO. I won't bore you with a recap of the story; many here have done admiral jobs of that. This movie has it all: Acting that is pure pork on the huff, dialog that never met a corny pun it could pass up, and art direction out of \\"Be Kind Rewind.\\"  I might add that this movie brought back fond(a) memories of other truly cheesy sci-fi flick from my childhood like: \\"In Like Flint,\\" \\"Our Man Flint,\\" \\"The Reluctant Astronaut,\\" \\"Land That Time Forgot,\\" etc. The main difference being, the SMOKIN' HOT nude shots of Ms. Fonda. Okay, they're pretty tame by today's standard.  Sure, some will argue that she was a communist sympathizer, but no one can deny she was an absolute HOTTIE back in the day.  Enjoy a little whine with this cheese.
B00005NTJK|5.0|Benefit - 1970  14 Tracks - (4 bonus)  (54:55)  *****<br /><br />Out of the early Jethro Tull albums, this is one of my favorites.  It falls right in with a string of great albums from Stand Up (1969) through Thick As A Brick (1972).  The interesting thing for me the first time I began to listen to this early classic was that I looked at the track listing and did not recognize any of the songs by their titles.  This particular \\"remastered\\" cd has four bonus tracks on it, and I did recognize the song Teacher, advertised as \\"the original UK version\\", but this was just one of the bonus tracks, not part of the original album.<br /><br />The music on this album has a good mix of acoustic and electric music.  It sounds very balanced, without too much of acoustic or electric sounds.  There is only one purely acoustic song and not really any heavy rockers like you might find on Aqualung for instance.  Also, for all the \\"proggers\\" out there like me, who tend to look for the longer tracks, there are a few reaching the six minute mark.<br /><br />With the addition of John Evan on keyboards, we get our first taste of piano on Alive And Well And Living In and the addition of organ in the background on Sossity, You're A Woman, which is one of the stand-out acoustic tracks.  I think Ian Anderson's voice is much improved on this album, recorded with more echo and obviously \\"dual-layered\\" on some songs creating a much richer and fuller sound.<br /><br />Many times the bonus tracks on these cd's are just filler songs or \\"throwaways\\" that just didn't make the cut before.  The ones offered here: Singing All Day, Witches Promise, Just Trying To Be, and Teacher, are kind of a mixed bag.  The first two are OK, but really just mediocre at best.  Singing All Day is a nice, upbeat acoustic number, while Witches Promise I would describe as a very traditional sounding Tull song.  Just Trying to Be is just a short little ditty that doesn't add much.  Teacher, on the other hand is a much better song, and one of my favorites.  It has all the elements of a good JT song.  Good guitar riffs that interplay with Ian's flute, lots of time signature changes along with good vocals, keyboards, and a cool bass-line.ites.  It has all the elements of a good JT song.

B001PPLJIQ|4.0|Kate Winslet's performance in The Reader is one of the most powerful that I have seen. It seems to me that this kind of acting is what has driven drama since the seminal plays of ancient Greece. Winslet portrays Hanna Schmitz, a German woman in her mid thirties who engages in a summer-long affair with a sixteen year old youth, Michael Berg (David Kross).    It's a torrid affair indeed. A major attraction for Hanna is that Michael reads aloud to her such classic books as Homer's Odyssey. Hanna even initiates a \\"read to me first\\" policy when Michael so ardently seeks her affections. The lovers part, and the film advances eight years, to 1966. Michael is now a law student. It so happens that he comes to observe the trial of a group of women who were SS concentration camp guards. One of these women is Hanna! To reveal much more would spoil it.    I think the films fails on a couple of points. First, amazingly, it does not explain why Hanna is illiterate, a crucial part of the film. Surely, there is a relatively simple explanation for this that Hollywood could invent. Secondly, it only feebly attempts to explain why Hanna participated in the murders of the Holocaust, certainly a far more challenging topic than the literacy issue. She seems to be a \\"good person.\\" Was she just following orders, as she, and so many other Germans claimed in the trials that followed the war? Can a \\"good person\\" do what she did? The film brings this up and then stumbles away from it.    Winslet carries this film. Without her acting it all becomes a mess. The other actors are fleeting shadows compared to her.
0061537969|5.0|Light, fun and very thought provoking to see the world from the view of an amazingly intuitive dog!  Our book group loved it!
1400034779|5.0|A short but very sweet book which introduces us to the lady detective for the first time.  I very much enjoyed how she coped with and solved each investigation plus the insights into her personal life. Looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B001CTDH4Y|3.0|I wasn't too crazy about the storyline... wasn't what i expected it to be. The dogs are all very cute in the movie tho; and how they make the dogs look like they're talking is incredible.  But i have to give it 3 stars due to the storyline.
0061537969|5.0|This book certainly covers a lot of ground. Topics include the nature of dogs, the cruelty of man, how to drive a race car under trying conditions, and reincarnation. And it covers these themes well. It has its peaks and troughs, but it's mostly peaks.     Author Garth Stein has Enzo, a dog, tell the story. I know there are other popular books that tell a story from the imaginary perspective of some animal, but this is my first, since, perhaps, grade school. Enzo's master is Denny, an aspiring race car driver. Early on the focus is on the serious illness of Denny's wife, Eve, and how Denny cares for both Eve and their young daughter, Zoe. Enzo, in his own doggy way, helps out during the crisis. Denny, Eve, Zoe, and Enzo make up one loving family.    Turns out the only real dogs in the story are Annika, a young woman, and Eve's parents, Mitch and Trish. Saying too much about these three might spoil the story. Suffice it to say that when you hear someone refer to a person as \\"a dog\\" they likely have people like this trio in mind, not a dog like the incredible Enzo.     The tale builds to a touching conclusion. Yes, it's all a bit silly, but its lack of cynicism and its spirit of essential optimism make it a solid read. Stein offers powerful insights into both human and canine nature. It's easy to recommend this book.
B000WS4P5G|4.0|Sort of like The Doors sandwiched between The Cult and Black Sabbath with extra cheese, Danzig is not for everyone. But any honest hard rock fan will have to admit that this is a really good record.  I think it borders on great.      There's not a boring track here, and everything is produced and mixed PERFECTLY.  Seriously, Rick Rubin has made some great records, but this is ridiculous.        I'm not a big Danzig fan, but I'm a big fan of this album. It has a dark, dirty, spontaneous feel, like G'N'R's Appetite For Destruction. It just works.  If you like bluesy metal, you gotta love it.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|There's nothing new in the 40th Anniversary Directors Cut from the original Directors Cut except that the intermission is at the end of the first DVD after TYA plays. In the original, CSN's set just stopped and that was the end of the first DVD. You put in the second DVD, TYA played, and up popped the intermission. Other than this, I can't say if the 40th Anniversary has better picture or sound. Haven't seen the Blu-Ray or the extras included in the Ultimate Collectors Edition.
B00006IU73|5.0|Hello !!    Porcupine Tree's music is so very different.  They have their very own style, which is SUPERB !!    This album (IN ABSENTIA) is so great!!  Don't hesitate in getting it, you will love this music.  Heavy riffs by Steven Wilson in this album are extremely good, melodic, rhythmic and well placed.  Mood changes within the songs are magnificent.  But don't misjudge PT as a metal band, because they're not.  Steven Wilson includes metal-like riffs in many of PT's songs, but songs are usually calm and very enjoyable !  To me it's like a prog-metal, vintage-rock style music.    Drums by Gavin Harrison... what can I say... extreme, complex, and beautifully performed.  Mr. Harrison is a really awsome example of what can be a accomplished as a top drummer, with a relatively small (but fine) rig.  He apparently doesn't need super-large rigs (as the ones played by Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy, with all due respect to Mike who is, at least to me, the world's best drummer).    Mr. Barbieri, mystic keyboards, just so GREAT !    Mr. Colin Edwin, oh my GOD !! That's some BASS, have no words to describe it.    As you can read, I love this band.  I'm a heavy fan of DREAM THEATER, but Porcupine Tree just  hits me on top, definitely !!    Keep it up Porcupine Tree, your music is INCREDIBLE with so many fans in MEXICO !!!

0312370849|5.0|Being alive on this earth when the tragedy of the holocaust was going on in Europe, I've been both thankful to be born in the US and fascinated with the tragedy that affected so many, many people. Why?????  This book travels back and forth in time, revealing lives of normal people living in France. The Germans had occupied the country and instructed the French police to round up all the Jews. The story focuses on one little Jewish girl and what happened to her during the round up.   The present day story focuses on a woman investigating the infamous round up in French history - that so many people were not even aware of today!   It was unbelieveable to discover the elements of living in Paris in 1942(?) - it is definitely not a time to forget, wherever one lives and at what time.
0385040253|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the most complete compendium of knots and how to tie them in print.  The illustrations are great and instructions easy to follow.  There is a great section on occupational knots that opens the history and use of knots to those of us curious as to where we came from.  This book is well worth the investment for those who have the need and is a great read in and of itself.
0545123267|5.0|Wow. This is poetic prose at it's best. The language was musical and poignant. A smart read-there were so many references to poetry, music, art, and mythology that just blew me away. All woven into a beautiful tale of impossible love. I am flabbergasted at how exquisite this novel is. If I could, I would display this novel for all to admire like fine art. However, I know I will read it again and again.<br /><br />Grace and Sam are in love. The kind of in love everyone wants. Magical, new, and true. I liked that it was written in alternating points of view. Both voices were strong yet each very different from one another. One thing they did share, however, was beautiful language. All the characters were superbly developed and each one found a small place in my heart. The plot was woven, it seemed, effortlessly-it never felt rushed or forced. The plot twists and turns came naturally and surprisingly. I loved every bit of this novel.<br /><br />Even the title kept reappearing in the novel. I'm not sure what the author actually meant but I took it as a metaphor for love. How difficult is it for the rest of us to find original metaphors for being in love? And this gem appears making it seem like love is the most natural and versatile language of all. I'm envious of the author.<br /><br />I can't recommend this novel enough. If you are a sucker for love stories, this is for you. If you like poetry, this is for you. If you like fantasy, this is for you. And for all others who just love a well-written story that will take you to another time and place, this is definitely for you. I can't say enough good things about this novel, so I won't-I challenge you to find your own words for Shiver by going out and reading it...now!

0061438294|5.0|What Every Body Is Saying is a wonderfully informative and fascinating book on the art of reading people. The author provides a thoughtful and detailed review of personally attained data, and presents it in a respectful and challenging way (like starting out with ten rules to obey before attempting to practice his techniques). There is great care and depth to this book, and the author's inclusive tone and humor is more like learning from an encouraging guide than a professor/intellectual. Great book and well written!
0765350386|2.0|Mistborn is an underdeveloped tale about slave-rebellion and metal-magic that will leave the reader feeling bored and unsympathetic. The characters and dialogue are generic and don't capture the scope of the human emotion. The magic is inventive and clearly defined but rendered worthless by its undramatic acquisition and use. The plot is unimaginative in its plight, rushed in its delivery, and predictable in its direction. Ultimately, you will not care for anything in this reading because it wasn't cared for in its writing.    The story almost goes like this: Man goes to prison, escapes with new powers, finds a lowly apprentice, \\"gives\\" said powers to apprentice. (Turn the page \\"left intentionally blank.\\") Months have passed. Now apprentice is almost as good as master and together they can liberate slaves because....well, slavery is bad.     Mistborn is like that.

The story of the journalist (who writes about Sarah's life) ties together her own and sarah's life, and gives the story a view into a hOLOcast victems' life in a consentration camp.  It was a compelling story and written very well.  I didn't want it to end.
0765350386|5.0|My favorite series of all time other than Dune, perhaps my favorite of all time if I truly have to make a decision.

Yet they maintained their civility and dignity from beginning to end - a strong message for those who have left dignity and civility somewhere in the dust of the past if they ever possessed it at all.<br /><br />If the title doesn't get you the contents will warm your heart for years to come and provide and opportunity to discern the needless uncivil and undignified acts that surround us each day.

However I would like to add to them and say that often when I read this sort of book involving a pet, I expect a real downer at the end; this book however is extremely uplifting, with an (I thought) simply perfect ending. So, don't be afraid to read the book already, It will make you feel GOOD!

Sookie the main character can read minds and shes human (but in the books shes something else also other than a telepath) and she meets a vampire named Bill, she cant read his mind so shes totally taken by him, anyway dont want to give too much away except that this show seems so real and its on the edge of too gross to \\"i think i like that\\" lol, anyway love it love it love it.

B000OLGCHA|3.0|After comparing this CD to my DVD copy of the film, this is the order that I came up with. Unfortunately not all of the film music is offered on this CD. You don't even get the ending credits or any of Luna's music. Many of the pieces are not even identical to what is found in the film (i.e. the 'Fireworks' track is what you find in the ending credits instead of when the twins set off their fireworks during the OWL examination and 'Darkness Takes Over' is presented backwards.)    1. Another Story  2. Dementors in the Underpass  3. Flight of the Order of the Phoenix  4. The Ministry of Magic  5. A Journey to Hogwarts  6. Umbridge Spoils a Beautiful Morning  7. Professor Umbridge  8. The Sacking of Trelawney  9. Dumbledore's Army  10. The Room of Requirements  11. The Kiss  12. Darkness Takes Over  13. Fireworks  14. The Sirius Deception  15. The Hall of Prophecies  16. Death of Sirius  17. Possession  18. Loved Ones and Leaving     Overall I love the music, but this CD leaves loads to be desired. They need to redo it with ALL the film music and in the correct order. Funny thing is this CD has only 18 tracks but the CD for 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince' contains 28 tracks. Did they learn their leason?
B000QCUB8I|4.0|While Justice is nowhere near as great as Daft Punk, they're still really good. Especially the first song, Genesis. It has a very heavy electro house sound that I really like. Also, D.A.N.C.E. is really cool, I love the disco sound it has. The rest of the album is good too but those are songs that stood out to me. If you're into Daft Punk I think you'll definitely like this.

1439138311|4.0|In its simple, sparse lyricism Toibin's latest is a moving and entertaining read and a portrait of a flawed but ultimately appealing individual. It is also a beautifully nostalgic portrayal of the Brooklyn/New York of the 1950s. In reflecting the immigrant experience that has so shaped American - and Australian - society and the emigrant experience that has even more more markedly shaped Ireland, it has historical and sociological import as well. But it is ultimately in its emotional resonance and lyricism that the beauty of the novel lies. Toibin is one of my favourite writers - originally due to his \\"gay\\" status, although as in many of his works, there is no overtly \\"gay\\" content here - and this is one of my favourite books of 2009 so far.<br />Recommended
B001TOD92C|5.0|I'm not a Mickey Rourke fan and I hate wrestling, boxing, MMA and all those violent guy sports.  So it's saying quite a lot that I really liked this film, and Rourke was outstanding.  The violence of the wrestling scenes was hard to take, but Rourke as the \\"Ram\\" character was so unbearably sad, lonely and pathetic that I was completely engrossed.  The scenes with his daughter were especially hearbreaking (Evan Rachel Wood was excellent), and Tomei was terrific, too.  The cinematography was excellent and so was the music. A high-quality film in every way.
B001DUJNGS|4.0|I would actually give this album 4.5 stars if I had the option.    I am a huge Enigma fan. My parents played the original Cds when I was a kid, and I fell in love with them. I give the 1st 6 Cds all five stars. It seems like fans think that \\"Voyageur\\" and \\"A Posteriori\\" are the weaker albums, but they are just as strong and passionate as the 1st 4 albums to me.     Unfortunately, I couldn't give this one five stars. Don't get me wrong, this is also an extremely great album, but there a few flaws that really take away from the album. Enigma is amazing because every song stands out, but they also flow together perfectly. The 7th album has minor flaws that slightly ruin the flow of the CD unlike the 1st 6 albums. Since so many people have done such a great job pointing out the overall majesty of this album,I'm going to point out the flaws.    The flaws: 1.) The Same Parents - I like this song as a whole, but the chorus is a bit off in the song. It's just a little too eerie for me I guess. Overall, It's still a good song. This song does flow very well in the album though 2.)Heaven's Hell - There is a sound in this song that sounds like my computer's throwing up. It's a cool sound, but it's way too sudden and WAY TOO LOUD! I literally jumped when I heard it for the 1st time. It jerked me out of the relaxed state that Enigma puts me in. It's such a shame because It's a fabulous song other than that. 3.) Distorted Love - This is the biggest flaw by far. The lyrics are SO CHEESY!!! I can't believe out of all of the brilliant songs and lyrics Cretu has written that he wrote song with lyrics like \\"touch me, I'll be your daddy.\\" I mean, you can't listen to this song without looking around seeing if anyone else is hearing these ridiculous lyrics. I can't be relaxed if I'm embarrassed. The instrumental part of the song is phenomenal though.    Other than those 3 things, this is another fantastic Enigma album. Even the 5 bonus songs are great. I would highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!
B000R4SMCW|3.0|First, most obvious, you can't charge a man with first-degree murder for pulling the plug on a brain-dead wife over whose life he probably had power of attorney.  Secondly, more important, how did he get the hotel key to switch the guns?
B002BBJ52U|1.0|Ok, any femanist who watches this movie would rather scratch their eyes out then watch this movie.  Women begging for dates, suspecting their husbands of making bad choices or settling for guys who won't commit.....what an exciting concept for a movie.  Ahh, I think NOT!  I am shocked so many high profile actors agreed to take these characters on.  I was completely disappointed by this movie.  It wasn't worth the $3.99 I paid for the rental.
B000UNYK3A|5.0|I'm posting this review because I'm honestly kind of shocked at all the bad reviews such a brilliant movie as this one is has gotten.  Then again, I guess this is the kind of film MOST people wouldn't be able to understand.  That's why I like it though!    Hostel is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a looooooooong time.  What I like about it is aside from an interesting plot, good acting, and all that jazz, it also presents the question: \\"what is a life worth?\\"    YES I could see how the beginning of the film could be boring for some, but that's because you're supposed to pay attention to the symbolism.  The whore house in the beginning where women are being trafficked for sex is a parallel to the Hostel's business of trafficking people to be killed off.    Hostel is so much more than some exciting slasher flick - it has depth, too.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I listen to this cd several times a week and never tire of it.  Eddie's voice is mesmerizing to say the least.  I get chills every time I hear Big Sun & Society.  My vote for one of the all time best movie music cd's.

0307269981|4.0|The reader is quickly mesmerized by the fascinating character of Lisbeth Salander, a young woman with unique abilities and a nightmarish past. She is again linked to journalist Mikael Blomkvist in this fast-paced thriller. Fortunately, this book focuses on Salander and is a much better book for it than the first, which featured Blomkvist more prominently. Because Salander does not think or act like most people, you cannot possibly predict what she will do which makes for great twists and turns in the plot. The story builds to a breath-taking ending. This is a book you will not be able to put down.<br /><br />It is more than a thriller, however. The enslavement of young women in the sex trade is the topic at hand, with an overlay of discrimination and prejudice of all types. Salander is the lightening rod for these explosive subjects. Oh, and there is a triple murder to solve as well!<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is revealed in all her fierce and uncompromising glory, layer by layer as the book progresses. I was rooting for her throughout her harrowing and sometimes horrifying adventures.<br /><br />I do recommend reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo before reading The Girl Who Played with Fire. My reading experience was richer for having read the first book. Can't wait for the next one!

B0009XNUK0|5.0|Even if you own all of Michael's music on the original CDs, this Essential collection can easily stand alone as a near-perfect \\"highlights\\" compilation--and naturally many of his best/most popular masterpieces are on it, so even the casual fan will be delighted. I took my 2 Essential CDs and copied all the songs to my iTunes library, added like 4 add'l MJJ/J5 songs from the iTunes store(like Dancing Machine) plus a few more from other MJ CDs (eg, Earth Song, One More Chance, and Break of Dawn [how hot!], then created 3 playlists ~75 mins each and burned them to my own CDs so I have all of these gems in the order I want (each CD I burned opens with Thriller and ends with Bad--just cuz I can, and cuz those 2 songs really get my juices flowing)! The man was a true genius in every sense, and it shows in his music in particular. A casual fan buying this compilation will almost inevitably want even more of Michael and go looking for the deeper cuts on the original albums--and another true/devoted fan will join our ranks! Michael was genuinely a one-of-a-kind performer/artist/musician/singer/dancer, etc, and esp. human being; he is much loved and deeply and sorely missed--but lives on in the hearts, souls, and minds of his truest fans. Michael 4 ever...

B0019LY5IM|5.0|Too much happens in Season 5 to go over but there is enough drama, action, mystery and suspense to please just about anyone. Some may be confused with the whole time travel plot line, but I think it will all come together beautifully in the final season and it will all make perfect sense. Or I hope anyway. Up till now, we have been getting more questions than answers and perhaps Season 5 is the weirdest of them all, but I thoroughly loved each and every episode. It has alot to offer. Though some characters were underutilized, others who have more screentime certainly benefit from it. We have a predictable romance, yes, but it also somehow feels genuine and when the tention mounts, you really feel it. There are alliances, and backstabbing, people that miraculously rise from the dead(or do they?) and of course, the mysterious Jacob is finally revealed. Or so we think. I suppose it can get frustrated at times, but I always ended up craving more after the end of each episode. That should be the purpose of any show and this succeeds on every level. The season ends in a cliffhanger that is impossible to ponder over or it will drive you crazy. There are theories galore, but most of them are probably wrong, so I don't even bother to think too much over it. It's sad to know that there is only 1 season left to go, but knowing we will finally be getting the answers will be well worth it.
6305428042|5.0|I have loved this movie ever since I saw it as a little girl in the movie theater! The movie is about three witches, Mary, Sarah, and Winifred Sanderson, who suck the life out of children in order to look young. In the 1600s the witches are hanged, but not before Winifred could cast a spell which would bring them back when a virgin lights the Blackflame candle. Flash to 1993 and a virgin, Max, lights the candle to impress a girl he likes, Alison, and brings to witches back to life. The three witches chase Max, his little sister Dani, and Alison throughout the night after they steal Winifred's magic Book.   This movie is filled with laughs and family fun! It's a great movie for Halloween and any other time you want a good laugh and wholesome movie!
0385342020|5.0|This book was a fun, quick read and different from the usual SK novel. The main female character is quirky and not having much luck professionally-similar to other lead characters in her novels, but the addition of a ghost that is her great aunt adds a new dimension to the plot. I think she did a great job with this one, loved the characters getting to know each other and really liked the mystery of the necklace. I thought that would have an anticlimactic resolution but was pleasantly surprised at how it all played out.  Highly recommend this one!  Would say it is my new fave of hers........

0676978010|5.0|I read this book as a liberal with an anti-corporate mentality. I read this book hoping I could gather specific examples of how big companies shape the world, and this book was a great commentary of several different neo-liberal revolutions across the world in the past 50 years.    It talks about the years of oppression South America faced under brutal right wing dictators influenced by American economists, The role of the IMF and the World Bank in pressuring countries to open their markets to foreign multinationals, and U.S policy under Bush which involved selling assets to companies in the name of counter-terrorism. Klein's thesis is basically that free markets do not always indicate free people. It also ends in a positive note commenting on some countries recovery after years of oppression.    This book gets criticized for misrepresenting Milton Friedman's views and not differentiating between a genuinely Free Market and a corporatist state. In reality, however, Milton Friedman played a huge role in the advancement of corporate states (ie sending advisers to Pinochet and still praising him despite human rights violations) and few right wing governments and institutions of today promote a capitalism where everyone is free to choose. The capitalism we know today is government teaming up with big companies to help corporations grow. This book is an excellent critique of this system and commentary on it's negative effect on the people of the world.
B001HV6IDY|5.0|One of the best business and self improvement strategy guides I have ever read. Over and over I have read it because the content is so systematic and worth repeating to get it to sink in.  I have reviewed many business and motivational leadership books and this is without question one of the best ever written.  I enjoyed it so much I had to order the audio as well to take with me on my business travels. I cannot stress enough the actual \\"here's how you do it\\" implementation throughout. No boring long winded 100+ year old stories from near to death narrators.  Pleasant to listen to, worth reading and I guarantee if you do not get anything from it, then you in fact must be the author. It is this good.  No, I am not the author nor any publisher/profesisonal reviewer. I am a small business owner in Cleveland and am growing!
159448385X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini follows his best-selling debut novel \\"The Kite Runner\\" The Kite Runner with a sequel that is every bit as splendid as the title suggests. The tone is set early: this is a story about the hardships women face in Afghanistan. Mariam is the daughter of a well-to-do man. Her mother had ended her own life, and Mariam feels a great shame about her life...is married-off to a much older man named Rasheed. Rasheed believes women are the property of their husbands and forces Mariam into a degrading life. This causes the young lady to live a fearful existence...for his temper can result in punches, slaps, and kicks...only to be followed by insincere apologies.     Laila is the second heroine in the story - she becomes Rasheed's second wife. Her life, though a bit brighter, also finds sudden tragedy. She was raised by an intellect who encouraged Laila to follow her dreams. One day, a wayward rocket fired by a warring faction lands on her house and kills her parents. Tariq, her boyfriend, had fled with his family only to become refugees in Pakistan. So now poor Laila, who once had a promising life, finds herself alone. When she discovers she is pregnant with Tariq's child and learns Tariq has been killed (supposedly) near the Pakistani border, she agrees to marry Rasheed.     Once Laila and Rasheed get married, Mariam becomes jealous of Laila, that is, until Aziza )Laila's child) is born. Mariam eventually becomes a second mother to Aziza, and the two woman become friends...and later allies, protecting each other from the abuse suffered by Rasheed. Some have mentioned that this book starts slow...and yes, it does. But eventually Khaled Hosseini's impeccable writing talent shines through and the emotions these two women must tolerate makes the reader forget about the early flaws. His ability to convey daily life for women in this harsh reality is something truly special and evident as to why Mr. Hosseini is a well-renowned author.

0307269981|5.0|A year has passed, and the Wennerstrom affair has finally calmed down. Mikael Blomkvist is no longer being hounded by the media, but he can't forget the young woman who saved his life: Lisbeth Salander. But Salander has seemingly vanished off the face of the earth, ignoring each and every attempt Blomkvist has made to contact her.<br /><br />Things haven't remained quiet at Millennium magazine however. Journalist Dag Svensson and his girlfriend, Mia Johansson, have been researching the multi-billion kronor sex-trafficking industry in Sweden, and Millennium is going to run the expose and publish Svensson's book. Before all the facts have been double-checked, Svensson and Johansson are found brutally murdered in their apartment. The prime suspect? Lisbeth Salander. It's up to Blomkvist and the handful of other people who believe in this strange young woman to prove her innocence. As far as Salander is concerned, there's only one person she can rely on to do this: herself.<br /><br />The first book in this series, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, was one of my Top Ten books last year. I had high hopes for this second book, and I wasn't disappointed. The police investigation into the double murder was stymied at every turn. The \\"expert witnesses\\" whose opinions are to be trusted, told the investigators what a menace to society Salander was. However, when they asked the same questions of the people who knew and worked with her, they got an entirely different picture of the woman. It took them valuable time to decide which people they should trust.<br /><br />Once again, the person at the center of it all-- Lisbeth Salander-- is the most fascinating. As a young girl locked away in a psychiatric hospital, she was asked \\"Why won't you talk to the doctors?\\" To which Salander replied \\"Because they don't listen to what I say.\\" If you don't listen to what this young woman says, she's not going to bother with you. At all. You won't even be a blip on her radar. When I turned the page to see \\"Part IV: Terminator Mode\\", I didn't bother to hide my grin. This could only mean that Salander was kicking into high gear. I loved seeing how Larsson tied the expose of the sex-trafficking industry and the double murder into Salander's own background, for this book does give insight into what makes Salander tick.<br /><br />If you want to get to know one of the most fascinating characters in modern fiction, read Larsson's books. Lisbeth Salander will enter your bloodstream like the strongest of narcotics.rminator Mode\\", I didn't bother to hide my grin. This could only mean that Salander was kicking into high gear.

0743487583|5.0|A Review of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein<br /> When has science gone too far?  What is man?  What is the responsibility of a creator to a creation?  These questions are resonant themes as well as questions that are presented throughout the book.  Shelley gives an answer to all three questions through the eyes of her main characters Victor Frankenstein and his \\"monster.\\"<br />  Immediately with Frankenstein's freakish human creation, the reader is quickly alerted to the wrongness of it.  The shock and horror felt by Frankenstein at his creature sets up the moral struggle that was so evidently in the mind of Shelley.  In her preface she mentions that the actuality of a creature being given life is not an impossibility according to Darwin and some physiological German writers.  With this in mind, Frankenstein is a book intended to create fear and engender greater moral responsibility to the science community and those who regulate it.  Frankenstein is shocked by the creature he created, and because of his selfishness, cowardice, and lack of compassion, Frankenstein's creature becomes a monster.  In regards to what constitutes a man -- it is a more philosophical question - this question is addressed clearly in the conversation between Frankenstein and his monster.  The monster had raised himself; he learned language and social skills by observing others, as well as the necessities of survival.  The monster had emotions and feelings, and though he was horribly deformed and a frightful looking creature, he was most assuredly human -- not because his physical members were collections of dead human corpses, but because he demonstrated that he could learn, communicate through language, and reason.  Shelley portrays this terrible dilemma for the monster that longs for human interaction, but because his looks are extremely frightening he is forced into isolation.  And then the next emphasis -- what is the creator's (Frankenstein's) responsibility to his creature, the monster?  It seems that is left ultimately up to the reader to resolve, but many passages lead one to determine that Frankenstein had a great responsibility for the creature and those around him.  The problem was that he catered to one individual in a foolish manner, and lost both because of his fear of the monster.<br /> When should one refrain from experimenting?  Well, interestingly Shelley seems to indicate that life is not something for the scientist to meddle in.  The horrors of the monster bring evils upon everyone that is even remotely connected to the monster.  The deaths of Justine, Elizabeth, and Clerval are terrible and gut wrenching, yet so is the pain of the monster and Frankenstein.  It seems that Shelley is asserting that life is sacred, and developing it can be dangerous.  Frankenstein, though with noble intentions, created and then abandoned his creation from fear, and it was from this act of abandonment that the monster blamed for his behavior.  The order of the world is set off balance because of Frankenstein's creature in Shelley's book, and this is because science was not appropriated correctly, but was instead used selfishly which ultimately resulted in lethal consequences.<br /> In the portion of the book where the creature recounts his two years before meeting up with Frankenstein, there was a narrative of how he survived.  The inhabitants of the cottage home that he observed became his unknowing teachers.  The monster learned how to talk, and learned social interactions in that he learned what a mother was, etc.  This even prompted a naturally human response -- kindness.  The creature took care of the people in the house, cutting down wood for them and doing other outdoor chores.  The creature surely resembled a man, yet his appearance in sighted so much terror that it is hard to grapple with the idea that he truly was a man because of his peculiar origins and the evil that he soon would embark on.  However, Shelley gives light to the reader on why the monster spreads terror throughout Frankenstein's circle of family and friends, thus rendering him human, and the reason cited is neglect.  Shelley devotes several chapters to the questioning of the creator by the created, and develops a rich dialogue between the two men.<br /> In the first chapter of the second volume, the monster lectures Frankenstein that Frankenstein's neglect of him was wrong, and that the bond between them can only be broken with one of their deaths.  Now comes in to play the question of the responsibility of a creator over his or her creation?  It seems Shelley would have the individual creator weigh the pros and the cons.  However, this is not done because Frankenstein was rash, and it then fell to him to destroy the work his hands had made.  The last part of the book is about Frankenstein unrelentingly pursuing the monster after he finally makes the good decision not to make a female monster.  Thus the lesson taught by Shelley's gothic horror reaches its final conclusion to eradicate a horrible mistake.<br /> In the Pocket Books publication of Frankenstein, it puts forward several themes that the publishers believe are the main motifs of the book.  The first they state is science versus nature.  They explain that \\"there are some things man is not meant to know (Pocket Books).\\"  It goes on to state that there is a struggle between what is natural and what is interference by man. Another theme is feminism and motherhood, because the publishers believe that this book provides an insight to a female mind, and gives a feminine interpretation of a gothic novel.  It is argued here that gothic tales are typically a male oriented type of writing, yet the most famous of gothic tales is by a woman.<br />The second to last theme cited is \\"monstrosity.\\"  \\"The issue of what is a monster lies at the heart of the novel.\\"  This main theme, according to the publishers, is what haunts the book through and through.  At moments the story sets up an emotional conflict that has you feeling sympathy for the monster, and yet at once also feeling fearful and disgusted by the monster's actions.  And the last theme is that of secrecy, because, of course, secrecy has a lot to do with the demise of the characters in the book.  It is secrecy that eats up Frankenstein, and holds him hostage to help his fellow man.<br />The Pocket Book publishers had it right.  This book surely is about science versus nature -- it is the same theme presented in this paper that asks when has science gone too far?  The question presented here is just a more blunt and simple form of the complex discussion of science versus nature.  Truly, this overarching theme is in play from the creation of the monster, to the havoc and blood shed wreaked by the monster, to Frankenstein's contemplation to appease the creature by creating another, to finally his pursuit of the demon.  It is a tale of people trying to achieve knowledge they should not.  The publishers argue that it is both Frankenstein and Robert Walton that are acting unnatural by trying to create life, but end up in fact destroying life.<br />The idea of feminism and motherhood really has little to do with this tale.  There seems to be nothing classically feminine about this tale, nor does it have anything to do with motherhood directly.  This tale is a great one because Mary Shelley was a brilliant and gifted writer -- just as many other women are as well as many men.  This book is a token of her greatness as an author, but this novel's greatness has nothing to do with feminine themes or motherhood.  It may be an interesting side note though, that at the time it was written very few women or mothers wrote books.  So it is also interesting that she was only 18 years old when she created this story, but surely none of these were factors that led to the book's success, rather it was the talent and dedication of Mary Shelley, the person.<br />The monstrosity and secrecy themes are extremely relevant.The monstrosity theme is linked to the other two questions presented in this paper -- what is man and what is the responsibility of the creator to the creation?  The monstrosity is what raises a question about responsibility to the creation, because it is undetermined whether the creation is a monster or human - if he is a monster then kill it or if human then help it.  Parts of this dilemma are briefly touched on in this paper, but are these links correct?  The monstrosity is what keeps the reader reading.  The reader is left with two decisions - is the creature a man or is it a monster?  The secrecy theme is also relevant.  Frankenstein refuses to tell authorities in the beginning about the monster, because he believes they will think him insane.  He keeps all this to himself until he has lost everyone important to him.  Only then does he finally start telling people.  Of course it is too late then, and his initial instincts were right, in that the people he tells, other than Robert Walton, do think he is crazy.  However, Robert Walton sees the creature himself at the end, so if he had any doubt it was displaced by sight.  The secrecy was so powerful that it ate at Frankenstein, and in a way, the tale was told because it was his last way to release the agony of keeping the secret.<br />Shelley's Frankenstein explores so many areas.  The themes are abundant and the ideas suggested, and bluntly stated, are sprinkled throughout.  Readers have been, and will continue to be challenged by this work.  Challenges that become more and more relevant each day with the world of changing technology.  When has science gone too far?  When should society enact ethics laws to block some science?  The questions go on and on ... the most important of all should be the resounding theme of the sanctity of life.  What constitutes life and when is it society's responsibility to take it, nurture it, or create it?  These questions are pondered and even given answers in Frankenstein.  The book also gives warning to those who are ambitious and those who have great talent to be careful, because oftentimes those attributes can lead to disaster as was so tragically seen by Frankenstein.<br />With our modern age full of amazing scientific discovery and meddling with the laws of nature (e.g. genetic engineering) this book will continue to fascinate.  It is ultimately unimportant, and probably was for Shelley too, whether or not man could really ever create life in the way Frankenstein did, but it is the maddening pursuit, the gross abandonment of morality and blinding terror of disorder that punctuates this story.  In an age that is wrestling with questions of science and morality such as embryonic research, abortion, life support, gender change surgery... this book serves as a strong caution...monsters may yet be created, and they may not be a work wrought just by  medical doctors and scientists, but rather they could become the monsters themselves.<br /> No matter which side one may come down on the issues of today, there is one thing that no one can dispute -- Mary Shelley, a woman who lived in the 19th century wrote a marvelous book that seems to become more relevant as time progresses.  A woman living in the times of Dr. Darwin, who contemplated his ideas and was challenged by her two friends and husband, wrote a novel that has invoked fear into many millions of readers.  Shelley penned the words of Frankenstein in an era that was beginning to boom with the modern interpretation of science, will always be remembered for her masterful work of art.  It most assuredly will continue to endure the test of time and will be a blessing to provide a conscience for modern science or a haunting reminder of what man was able to do, but shouldn't have.<br /><br />Work Cited<br />Shelley, Mary.

Truly, this overarching theme is in play from the creation of the monster, to the havoc and blood shed wreaked by the monster, to Frankenstein's contemplation to appease the creature by creating another, to finally his pursuit of the demon.  It is a tale of people trying to achieve knowledge they should not.  The publishers argue that it is both Frankenstein and Robert Walton that are acting unnatural by trying to create life, but end up in fact destroying life.  The idea of feminism and motherhood really has little to do with this tale.  There seems to be nothing classically feminine about this tale, nor does it have anything to do with motherhood directly.  This tale is a great one because Mary Shelley was a brilliant and gifted writer -- just as many other women are as well as many men.  This book is a token of her greatness as an author, but this novel's greatness has nothing to do with feminine themes or motherhood.  It may be an interesting side note though, that at the time it was written very few women or mothers wrote books.  So it is also interesting that she was only 18 years old when she created this story, but surely none of these were factors that led to the book's success, rather it was the talent and dedication of Mary Shelley, the person.  The monstrosity and secrecy themes are extremely relevant.  The monstrosity theme is linked to theother two questions presented in this paper -- what is man and what is the responsibility of the creator to the creation?  The monstrosity is what raises a question about responsibility to the creation, because it is undetermined whether the creation is a monster or human - if he is a monster then kill it or if human then help it.  Parts of this dilemma are briefly touched on in this paper, but are these links correct?  The monstrosity is what keeps the reader reading.  The reader is left with two decisions - is the creature a man or is it a monster?  The secrecy theme is also relevant.  Frankenstein refuses to tell authorities in the beginning about the monster, because he believes they will think him insane.  He keeps all this to himself until he has lost everyone important to him.  Only then does he finally start telling people.  Of course it is too late then, and his initial instincts were right, in that the people he tells, other than Robert Walton, do think he is crazy.  However, Robert Walton sees the creature himself at the end, so if he had any doubt it was displaced by sight.  The secrecy was so powerful that it ate at Frankenstein, and in a way, the tale was told because it was his last way to release the agony of keeping the secret.  Shelley's Frankenstein explores so many areas.  The themes are abundant and the ideas suggested, and bluntly stated, are sprinkled throughout.  Readers have been, and will continue to be challenged by this work.  Challenges that become more and more relevant each day with the world of changing technology.  When has science gone too far?  When should society enact ethics laws to block some science?  The questions go on and on ... the most important of all should be the resounding theme of the sanctity of life.  What constitutes life and when is it society's responsibility to take it, nurture it, or create it?  These questions are pondered and even given answers in Frankenstein.  The book also gives warning to those who are ambitious and those who have great talent to be careful, because oftentimes those attributes can lead to disaster as was so tragically seen by Frankenstein.    With our modern age full of amazing scientific discovery and meddling with the laws of nature (e.g. genetic engineering) this book will continue to fascinate.  It is ultimately unimportant, and probably was for Shelley too, whether or not man could really ever create life in the way Frankenstein did, but it is the maddening pursuit, the gross abandonment of morality and blinding terror of disorder that punctuates this story.  In an age that is wrestling with questions of science and morality such as embryonic research, abortion, life support, gender change surgery... this book serves as a strong caution...monsters may yet be created, and they may not be a work wrought just by  medical doctors and scientists, but rather they could become the monsters themselves.   No matter which side one may come down on the issues of today, there is one thing that no one can dispute -- Mary Shelley, a woman who lived in the 19th century wrote a marvelous book that seems to become more relevant as time progresses.  A woman living in the times of Dr. Darwin, who contemplated his ideas and was challenged by her two friends and husband, wrote a novel that has invoked fear into many millions of readers.  Shelley penned the words of Frankenstein in an era that was beginning to boom with the modern interpretation of science, will always be remembered for her masterful work of art.  It most assuredly will continue to endure the test of time and will be a blessing to provide a conscience for modern science or a haunting reminder of what man was able to do, but shouldn't have.

0440241901|5.0|I am trying to remember the last time I laughed, so hard that tears streamed down my face, while listening to a book. Hmmm... nope, can't think of another book that made me laugh like this while I listened to it.<br /><br />Kate Reading's performance has to be one of the absolute best I have ever listened to.  Her timing and voicings are spot on. She perfectly captures the hapless optimism of Kinsella's heroine, Emma Corrigan, a junior assistant at Panther Cola Company, who is striving to earn a promotion.<br /><br />While returning from a business trip to Scotland,  Emma's worst flying fears are realized when the plane hits a terrible patch of turbulence.  Panic stricken, she begins to blab a stream of consciousness, divulging her secret hopes, wishes, transgressions and fears to the man sitting next to her in business class.<br /><br />The next day she discovers this man is Jack Harper, the owner and founder of Panther Cola when he arrives at her office on a corporate visit. To her horror, he seems to remember every single thing she told him.  Emma's life is complicated enough with a boyfriend she doesn't really love, two roommates -- one, a lawyer and the other, a scary fashionista-man-hunting socialite, as well as parents who don't seem to love her and a grandfather who does.<br /><br />Kate Reading hits exactly the right tone for Emma, her flatmates, Jack and her family.  The story has great humor and a sweet pathos that was a perfect listen.

B000HCO83Q|4.0|In my opinion, this movie was definitely not as good as X2, but a nice improvement over X1.   I understand some of the concerns for this movie, and I agree with some of them. There was a change of directors between the first two films and this one, and it shows. This movie also made the mistake that the first two didn't - it introduced way too many mutants with not enough time to properly flesh them out. So why did I like this movie...  Well... here is where I'm probably going to get heat.  This is purely MY opinion, but I never liked Cyclops... at all. I cringe when people say, \\"they should do an X-Men Origins on Cyclops!\\" Ehhhh... So without spoiling anything, when Cyclops's screen time was 'cut short' I was very happy. Also, when Professor Xavier's screen time was 'cut short, I didn't object to that either. BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG! I love Xavier and he's one of my favorite guys, and it was a huge risk to do this in the story, but I believe that what happened in his scenario added a stronger sense of sadness and desperateness to win the battle and make 'The Last Stand'.    The story was clever and it took a lot of risks. But my favorite thing about this movie was the action. We finally get to see Iceman cover his whole body in ice, Storm is a lot more powerful, and Magneto was the @*%$. Even with the action better, there were still some things I wished I could've seen. It would've been cool for Pyro to make images with his fire attacks, and Rouge could've been more active.  Overall, X3 was a fun and action packed film if you can forgive some of the risks the filmmakers made with the story.
0446402389|4.0|Tom Rob Smith's award-winning 1st novel, \\"Child 44\\", is an instant classic and the best Russian-based murder mystery since Martin Cruz Smith's \\"Gorky Park\\".    It is 1953, near the end of the Stalin-era, and MGB Officer Leo Demidov is tasked with investigating the discovery of a dead boy found by the railroad tracks.  Not only was the body naked and brutalized, it happened to also be the son of another MGB officer.  Acting as a good citizen during the ultra-paranoid Stalin-era, Demidov confronts the boys' father and family to convince them it was a horrible accident.  When an eyewitness comes forward with claims of seeing the boy in the company of a strange man, Demidov and his team begin to investigate.  They apprehend and question a man they suspect of the crime - who eventually dies in their custody. THe MGB seeks to quickly brush the matter under the carpet --- but Leo begins to have different ideas and begins a personal investigation into a string of child murders that will threaten his and his entire families existence in Stalinesque Russia.    The novel is impossible to put down and Tom Rob Smith will keep readers guessing throughout.  He also employs an intersting \\"non-punctuation\\" style where all of the spoken dialogue is depicted by italics rather than standard quotation marks.  This is not the only unique thing about Smith's writing style as any and all awards he receives for this outstanding first effort are justly deserved.  I look forward to reading more in the Leo Demidov series.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2 is not only the best out of the current four films in the film franchise, it is probably my favorite Marvel comic book movie of all time! (Spider-Man 2 was just as good). Everything is better this time around. The action is a huge improvement from the first film, and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat. I also liked the direction this movie went in. The first film dealt with the X-Men facing off against Magneto's brotherhood of evil mutants. The first movie was strictly mutant VS mutant. X2 involves the humans taking the fight to the mutants. It was amazing to see how the X-Men fight for what they believe is right, even if the ones they hope to protect are the ones that hate them. The X-Men go great lengths this movie, and there are casualties on both sides.  With a movie that sticks to the comic book even more this time around, hardcore fans should be pleased. Characters are fleshed out even further, particulaly Wolverine, Jean Grey, the newer mutants, and the newly introduced Nightcrawler. Its rare to find a superhero movie that not only has a good story, but a touching one as well. X2 fits this criteria and more. Job well done!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I am so sick of every race other than the 'horrible white man' complaining of racism when they live in America. Frankly, present yourself as a respectible person and you will be treated as such. Clint Eastwood was fantastic!
B000AYELVA|4.0|I believe that the first film in the X-Men film franchise was a solid start. As the title says, this is what an X-Men movie should be like. I like how the movie doesn't make the mistake of introducing too many mutants at once, since I don't think that there would've been enough time to flesh everyone out. With that said, I am also very happy that they did not go too in depth with characters. This way, there is more room left to explore character's origins in the future films.   While the action is forgettable, the story still progressed well. Characters developed nicely with highlights including Wolverine and Rouge's friendship and Xavier and Magneto's opposite ideologies for humans and mutants. The setting for the movie revolving around increased tension between humans and mutants was established quite well. All in all, director Bryan Singer did a good job. Original story, dialogue, and music make this movie something that will be cherished by both X-Men fans and newcomers alike.  The movie keeps true to the comic book, but it doesn't come without its tweaks. Certain tweaks were expected, but some tweaks stand out more than others. The complicated and interesting rivalry between Wolverine and Sabretooth is... well... its not really there. Sure the two go at it a couple times in the movie, (and they take a disliking to each other quick), but the dialouge between them is pretty much absent. And Toad... well don't expect that funny, pitiful lackey of Magneto. In this movie he is actually quite dangerous. While these tweaks don't bother me too much, they're just minor examples of some changes made from the original comic book franchise.
B000YAA68C|5.0|Made my heart melt, my husband even liked it. Not one of his facvorites but he said it was good for a chick flick.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|X-Men Origins: Wolverine could've and should've been better. I admit, when I first saw this movie I liked it a lot. But then when I thought about it, I realized how bad it really was. On my first watch I thought that it was such a pleasure to watch the movie, but I was disappointed on my second watch. I've been reading several fan reviews on this movie and came to this conclusion. If you are a hardcore comic book fan of Wolverine or are looking for something new, you probably will be disgusted with what they did with the movie. If you aren't too familiar with the comic book stories of Wolverine or are just looking for some quick entertainment, this movie is for you. I find myself in between these two groups.   Some positives of the movie were Wolverine himself. Hugh Jackman was the best actor in the film. I was also so happy to see that complicated relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth that was absent from X1. Other characters that stood out were Gambit and WADE WILSON (NOT THE FILM'S VERSION OF DEADPOOL). Some people also said that the action and special effects were bad. I disagree to a certain point.   Some negatives were the story. One minute the story seemed exciting, then it would fall flat on its face. The ending was exciting, but it was also... uh... how can I put this... STUPID. I'd love to spoil things so I can talk in more detail, but I think you should just see it for yourself. It's a shame that Fox greenlit a sequel to this film. I believe that there can be too much of a good thing, especially if you do it wrong. I can't wait for the Deadpool spinoff. However, I think that X-Men Origins is a perfect example of how something with so much potential can turn out for the worst.

0060763280|4.0|This book is a do-it-yourself, coach like, book.  It is full of exercises for you to do on your own or with a group.  It's all about the action and attitude that's necessary to build wealth. People can be brilliant, but they won't become wealthy unless they know what actions and attitudes to apply.  Mr. Eker says that people are ingrained with money blueprints, such as, \\"save it for a rainy day\\", that get in the way of achieving monetary success.  It is a fun book to read with lots of personal stories about Mr. Eker and his clients.<br /><br />The first part focuses on discovering what your money blueprint is.  The second part of the book is Mr. Eker's principles of wealth and how to use them to your advantage.  An example of one of the wealth principles is, \\"The true measure of wealth is net worth, not working income\\".  This principal is followed by a lesson on increasing net worth and associated actions, such as creating a net worth statement sheet.  Hence some of these may seem obvious but the difference is applying the correct action that would be needed to make a difference. The storytelling really highlights the impacts of taking or not taking actions. I love this book and keep going back to it. Has it helped me?  While I have not made millions yet...I have a much better awareness of where I stand and I am in the process of consolidating and growing my financial portfolio.  Mr. Eker is a variation of the Susie Orman type - a personality, with opinions, principles and practical advice.
0765356147|5.0|The great volcanoes are gradually covering the world in ash and the cloying mists are lasting longer with each passing day. Crops are failing, humanity is divided and the world is dying. Elend Venture, the emperor of humanity, and his Mistborn wife Vin are doing their best to repair the damage caused by events at the Well of Ascension, but their efforts seem in vain. An ancient destructive force has been unleashed upon the world, and many of their allies have been struck down.    Sazed, last of the Terris Keepers, has lost his faith and now struggles to find a reason to live. The kandra TenSoon has been declared a traitor to his people and put on trial. The Steel Inquisitors and the monstrous koloss have found a new master and now prey on the weaker cities of humanity. As unthinkable as it sounds, it appears that removing the Lord Ruler may not have been the wisest of ideas...    The Hero of Ages opens with the world in a pretty apocalyptic state. Things are, as we are told in great detail, very bad indeed and our heroes' struggles to survive without becoming as brutal as the Lord Ruler are testing them to their limits. Sanderson successfully lays on the gloom and darkness throughout the book, creating an oppressive, backs-against-the-wall atmosphere that frequently has the reader scratching their heads and wondering how their heroes are going to get out this mess. The answer comes in a lengthy series of revelations (sometimes skirting perilously close to info-dumps, but Sanderson manages to just about avoid that pitfall) that are stunning, impressive and extremely logical given what has come before.    The characters continue to develop nicely, with some characters who were only in supporting roles in earlier books coming to the fore here, particularly Marsh and Spook. As with the previous book, there is definitely a lessening of the focus on Vin, who becomes just one more member (albeit frequently the most important) of the ensemble cast here rather than the out-and-out heroine. Oddly, this is actually works very well, since Vin's character has been explored and developed in the previous two volumes to the point where there isn't much more to be done with her.    The gloom that fills the book occasionally threatens to make events too bleak, with the wit and humour of the previous books reduced somewhat, but the pace is definitely turned up a notch from the second book and at around the three-quarters mark events explode into motion, carrying us through the hugely ambitious finale. Epic fantasies often collapse during their finale chapters and if Mistborn falters (some events in the Kandra Homeland during the final few chapters don't seem to make much sense given events at the start of the book), it is to a considerably less-pronounced degree than others. The ending is consistent with what has come before, features some excellent twists on the established characters and magic systems, and leaves clear hints of there being more to come, as well as clues for those readers interested in the greater cosmology and universe which Mistborn shares with Elantris, Warbreaker and the forthcoming Stormlight Archive series.    The Hero of Ages (****½) is a ferocious and satisfying conclusion to the Mistborn Trilogy, confirming Sanderson's status as one of the most promising writers to emerge in the field recently. The book is available now in the USA and will be published by Gollancz on 11 February 2010 in the UK.

B001QTQ8IW|5.0|One afternoon I fell asleep with my TV on.  In my sleep, I heard this jazzy mature voice singing a wicked rendition of Summertime.  When I sat up and looked at the TV set, I saw this little, curly, red-headded girl belting out like it was no tomarrow.  I know the girl was Lauren because I was looking at Still Standing, but I had NO IDEA she could sing.  There are no words I can use to convey just how phenonmenal she is!  The best compliment I can give is since she is not appearing in the DC Metro Area, I would catch a plane to attend her concert at the nearest venue.  I've only said that about Minnie Ripperton and Rosemary Clooney, who both passed away before I could see them in concert, but Ms. Renee Olstead has convinced me to don't delay, don't wait, see her before the year is out.

159102594X|5.0|The First Law trilogy is one of the best fantasy series ever. Provided you like dark and realistic fantasy. The characters are typical fantasy stereotypes, at least that is your first impression. Later you will realize, that each character is rather different from what you imagined. Brilliant. The books follow the fate about half dozen different characters in a very well built world: a young noble, a wizard, a northman warrior, an inquisitor, a young officer and a few more. Graphic violence, a nicely paced plot, a quest, a war and dark humor - this book has it all. Do not miss it.

1594202249|5.0|As many have already written, Thomas Pynchon is an acquired taste, like jazz and silent comedy (two other tastes I have joyfully acquired).  I first tasted Pynchon, like most readers my age, in his debut novel, \\"V.\\"  Somewhere between the silliness of the \\"whole sick crew\\" and the all-too-seriousness of Stencil's Oedipal search, I realized I was reading someone who was a literary personification of a Jerry Garcia dictum:  \\"It's not enough to be the best at what you do.  You have to be the only one to do what you do.\\" I was (am) hooked.    Not that Pynchon hasn't let me down.  I did not like \\"Against the Day\\" after page 250 or so (or once we left the Colorado miners behind), and \\"Vineland,\\" I thought, was a bad joke.  \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" is probably still his best, but for  warmth and humanity, \\"Mason & Dixon\\" tops it.  Many reviewers are already referring to his new book, \\"Inherent Vice,\\" as his warmest, but I still vote for Charles & Jeremiah.    What \\"Inherent Vice\\" is, is a wonderful joyride. It probably doesn't hurt that I was an idealistic hippie in the spring of 1970, somewhat younger than protagonist Doc Sportello, but just as disgusted with what Pynchon calls \\"flatland.\\"  There are the usual Pynchon foibles - too many stupid names, too much loveless sex, too many bad punchlines.  But there is something so easy about reading it - and that is certainly unusual for Pynchon.  I'm not sure if all readers will have as easy a time as a Pynchon devotee like me, but I don't see how this novel could present any real difficulties.  Just remember that plot continuity is not really all that important in any PI novel.  Raymond Chandler agrees with me on that last point, and Pynchon is obviously lovingly parodying Chandler and Hammett in \\"Inherent Vice.\\"     The greatest element of the novel is the aforementioned Doc Sportello, who, although referred to in the third person, is the narrative point of view through which the tale is told.  We see all of Gordita Beach and Greater Los Angeles through his pot-clouded senses.  Doc shares something with all of the great detectives of the genre like Chandler's Philip Marlowe or Hammett's Continental Op -a code of honor.  In Doc's case, he is loyal to the hippie subculture that is trying to eke out an existence by the waves instead of joining the decrepit and meaningless straight world.  As one character puts it, the tug is between the hippie lifestyle of \\"freedom\\" vs. \\"that endless middle class cycle of choices that are no choices at all.\\"  Doc sees that his and his friends' way of life has a short expiration label, but he does everything in his power to keep it running as long as it can.  And, of course, in the spring of 1970 in L.A., it was running out quickly, what with Manson and his family, who are eerily in the background throughout the novel.    I won't give anything away.  I will tell you that Pynchon's novel, if not his warmest, is definitely his most comic.  I mentioned earler that there are too many flat punchlines.  Did I mention that there are hundreds of good ones?    Michael Santa Maria
0060825456|5.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman -- and it doesn't matter if it's a kid's book.<br /><br />And while some books are drained of their magic and mystery by being turned into graphic novels, \\"Coraline: The Graphic Novel\\" doesn't suffer from that problem. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, and P. Craig Russell graces Gaiman's story with lifelike, eerie illustrations.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (not \\"Caroline\\" is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a formerly bricked-up door that leads into an apartment in another world, which looks eerily like her own. In fact, it's so similar that she has a taloned, button-eyed \\"other mother\\" and matching \\"other father,\\" as well as a chorus of singing, dancing rats and magical toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are very attentive. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's writing is some of the most vivid and evocative that you'll find in literature, full of nightmarish details and creepy characters. And he infuses this story with a dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children in a mirror, beetles, disembodied hands, monsters that cling to the wall with souls in their grip, and rats that sing about how \\"we were here before you rose, we will be here when you fall.\\"<br /><br />And frankly this graphic novel could have been capital-R RUINED if it had been given \\"cartoony\\" artwork, or if it had been sped up or excluded too much of Gaiman's. Fortunately P. Craig Russell doesn't do anything of the sort -- the story unfolds slowly but carefully, and he doesn't cut much out from Gaiman's original novel. And he includes just the right amount of eerie narrative (\\"her other mother' hand scuttled off Coraline's shoulder like a frightened spider\\"). Normally it bothers me when a graphic novel describes what is happening in the panels, but somehow it didn't here because of the atmosphere it creates.<br /><br />And Russell's art is brilliantly suited to Gaiman's works, with a very realistic style, detailed expressions and an eye for the subtle stuff. His \\"other mother\\" is especially good -- she has a long pasty face with big teeth, with bony taloned fingers and freaky doll-like posture. She looks like a warped version of Coraline's real mom, just as she should.<br /><br />And he brings to life the decayed eerieness of the old apartments, the glitzy stage, and the weird singing rats -- as well as the more colorful if mundane world that Coraline belongs to. As Coraline's journey becomes more horrific, he adds more grey tones, shadows and surreal details to the story, such as her creepy final encounter with her disintegrating other father. But there are also some haunting, lovely visuals, such as the full-page image of a rose-lined Victorian house.<br /><br />\\"Coraline: The Graphic Novel\\" brings Neil Gaiman's story to life in beautiful, horrific detail, and even weaves some of his prose into the narrative.

But I have to admit, the way you handle it can be.<br /><br />That seems to be the goal of \\"Juno,\\" a relentlessly quirky, cracking-wise little comedy about a girl who makes a dumb mistake, and the smart decisions she has to make after that. While it initially seems rather precious, the Wes Andersonesque scriptings hide a bittersweet, warm little story about responsibility and love.<br /><br />After a lot of Sunny D and three pregnancy tests, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) comes to the inevitable conclusion: she's pregnant by her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).<br /><br />Because she \\"heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant,\\" Juno initially goes in for an abortion, but ends up running out of the clinic. Instead, she's going to have the baby and give it to someone who wants one, but can't have it. So she reluctantly fesses up to her parents, and starts scouting ads for suitably (if unedgy) parents for her baby -- the wealthy Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner).<br /><br />Mark and Juno form a bond over their shared tastes, but she starts to suspect that not all is well in Yuppieland -- especially when Mark decides to break up with Vanessa, because fatherhood would force him to be a grown-up, not a rock god. As her due date approaches, Juno must decide what is best for herself, Vanessa, the baby... and just maybe, the adoring Paulie.<br /><br />Recliners on the lawn, cactus-grams, guitars with names and \\"The Wizard of Gore\\" -- it's pretty obvious that \\"Juno\\" will win prizes for kooky quirk, if nothing else. It certainly has that in spades, and while it has some awkwardly scripted moments, the colourful and acerbic portrait of a teenage girl having to make some heavy adult decisions is definitely a winning one.<br /><br />Admittedly, \\"Juno\\" is a bit too precious in the first few scenes, when we have a weird store clerk saying things like \\"Your eggo is preggo\\" and getting replies like \\"Silencio!\\" Come on, loosen up and stop trying to be cooler-than-thou.<br /><br />But as the pregnancy storyline really kicks in, \\"Juno\\" settles into a storyline that is equal parts quirky-funny and touching. Jason Reitman flavours the whole plot with his snappy, clever direction with plenty of acid-laced voiceovers from Juno, on the world around her. And Diablo Cody's dialogue ranges from deliciously sharp (\\"I'm not crying, I'm just allergic to fine home furnishing\\") to entertainingly over-the-top (\\"Phuket, Thailand!\\").<br /><br />But as witty and quirky as the plot is, it wouldn't be much if it didn't also have a heart. As the movie winds on, we get to see Juno maturing -- learning to weigh coolness vs. maturity, appreciate her family, and what is right for her baby and the Lorings -- the scene where Juno helps an upset Vanessa talk to her baby is adorable. Not to mention that our pregnant heroine has to figure out whether true love is staring her in the face.<br /><br />Ellen Page gives a note-perfect performance -- her Juno is funny, sassy, wise beyond her years, and profoundly unconventional (\\"Thundercats are go!\\"). Cera is equally good in a more subdued, lovably dorky role; it's pretty hard not to love Paulie just for being himself. And Garner and Bateman are wonderful too, as an uptight, lonely woman who desperately wants a baby, and a Peter Pan type who doesn't want to act like a grown-up. Bleah, who needs him?<br /><br />\\"Juno\\" has its flaws -- moments of excessive preciousness -- but it has plenty of heart, wicked dialogue, and excellent acting.

B000002L61|4.0|Former Rainbow and Black Sabbath lead singer Ronnie James Dio has also had a successful solo career.  His second solo effort, The Last In Line, just plain rocks.  He picked up right where he left off after the success of Holy Diver.<br /><br />The album opens with We Rock.  Great vocals, drumming and guitar.  My personal favorite track is the title track, The Last In Line.  It's so heavy and powerful.  It just plain rocks all the way.  Great lyrics, too.  The song I Speed At Night is no doubt a drug song (LSD), but it rocks like crazy and is very fast.  Great song.  Evil Eyes sounds like an old Deep Purple or Rainbow tune.  The hit Mystery has a great melody, like most hits do, of course.  The song Egypt (The Chains Are On) is slower than other songs, but still rocks with classic Dio attitude.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album.  Ronnie James Dio is one of the greatest hard rock singers of all time, right up there with Robert Plant, Ozzy Osbourne, Ian Gillan, Rob Halford, Bruce Dickinson, and Tony Martin.  If you wanna rock, buy this album.
6304696558|5.0|It is the kind of movie that I would be classify indie, Goldie is exquisite, a charm and so witty and smart...I am not a fan of her and yet I have not seen much movies with her, but now I know why she is so famous...  and I appreciate a good pro-woman girlpower movie....  1. storyline is dynamic and quite realistic yes you could be by accident a widow divorcee at 29 yo  2.humor loaded, sexy and innocent at once  3. portrait of women : strong women , sisterhood in the army ...  4. a coming out of age movie about a girl who becomes a woman    I was so found of the movie that I wanted to join the army so I can become tough skin too, a strong woman...    Also to go back to the movie, for those who did not know what looks like a JAP or Jewish American Princess whell Judy Benjamin is one , a privileged jewish young woman, without the attitude though...   great movie....
0307588335|5.0|I blew off the book a few weeks ago when it first came out thinking this was another opportunistic hack trying to capitalize on a story we all know the end to...i am really glad i bought the book a few days ago, and finished it last night...It is a SUPERB book for novice and professional alike...it very succinctly gives a nice synopsis of the developing overleverage in the system more in the 2nd part of the book, as well as some insights on a \\"real\\" prop trading desk. In the first part of the book Larry covers his early career, which for me was useful to better understand the perspective of the guy who was working on a prop trading desk at lehman for 4 years. Some of the negative reviews lambast the author for being a mid level trader and covering his early career. Quite the contrary, on a battlefiled, i think it is much easier to get a \\"real picture\\" from a \\"Sergeant\\" then it is from a \\"Colonel\\", and i enjoyed understanding how that \\"Sergeant\\" thought. Larry picks on the subprime originators, I live and work in Newport Beach (as a money manager) so buying puts against New Century in my own account was a no-brainer, but i completely missed that Citibank was going to a $1...said another way, it was easy to see one part of the elephant, but not the whole thing. Larry's book helped me better put a subject i know well into even better perspective. I can't help but feel there are a boat load more land mines laying around. GREAT BOOK, order it today.
B0000026WD|5.0|This album was absolutely amazing. As if Michael Jackson hasn't proven himself with 3 albums before this one, he definitely proves he still has it on this album. I love how Michael can bring new beats and different kind of music and still make it magnificent. The music on this album is different and I LOVED it. Some of the hits on this album include: Black Or White, In The Closet, Jam, Remember the Time, Dangerous, Give In To Me, and many more!! I loved this album and you will not regret buying it!
B000XTLUW0|5.0|H.A.A.R.P is a double cd/dvd set with awesome images of a MUSE live concert in Wembley UK.<br />All the songs are really good, and has a great audio quiality.<br />Very recommended
B00005QGAX|5.0|I loved both Off The Wall and Thriller albums, but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this album! This is byfar my favorite!! I truly loved every single song on this album. Michael wrote almost every song on this album and I guess that is why I LOVED it soo much. This album contains some of the hits like: Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Liberian Girl, Smooth Criminal, Dirty Diana, Leave Me Alone. Also, on this album there is 3 never before heard songs. You will not regret buying this cd. I LOVE Michael Jackson!!
B0000AOV85|5.0|Just when you are totally convinced that you can't possibly enjoy something one bit more...this is an incredibly enjoyable, informative and fascinating documentary. I love Dark Side even more because this has really made it an even richer experience. Alan Parsons presentation of the music is awesome...he is a genius of timing. You will love this!
0312370849|5.0|I really loved this book.  Sarah was such an amazing young child.  I am only sorry that she died so young.  While the book didn't say, my feeling was that she never forgave and probably died bitter.  The way the book was written was very interesting, although I must admit that I jumped across some chapters to read more about Sarah and then went back and read those that I missed.  I thought one of the more interesting aspects was how the French police who had been enemies of the Germans very quickly took the part of the persecuter.  At the same time so many French people were taking in and hiding the Jewish people, especially children.  I loved the book and never want to forget!
B00003CX9E|4.0|There are lots of movies we can argue one must see in his lifetime.  Casablanca, Ben Hur, Star Wars, The Godfather, The Wizard of Oz, Gone with Wind... just to name a few, but few stand as high on that list of \\"Movies you should see at least once,\\" quite like Citizen Kane.  At the time of it's release in 1941, it was hailed as one of the movies which changed the industry.  The reasons why are all but forgotten now.  So all Citizen Kane has to stand on now is it's story, acting and script.  All of which are fine.  It's a movie that has aged somewhat well over the years.  The debate over the greatest movie ever made will rage on fforever (but you mostly see Citizen Kane and Casablanca somewhere on that list).  When Citizen Kane debuted, however, it was incredibly good craftsmanship for filming.  Remember, film was fairly young at this time.  There were still a lot of things that were being played around with and experimented with in film.  Citizen Kane, upon release, was hailed as a technical achievement that, for many reasons may seem like they aren't such a big deal today.  But they WERE a big deal then.<br /><br />Almost everyone knows the story of Citizen Kane, but it doesn't hurt to recount it.  The story begins on Kane's death bed.  He utters one last word: \\"Rosebud...\\" before he dies.  Because of this, people are in question as to what Kane's last word meant.  What was the meaning behind \\"Rosebud\\" and who or what was it?  As people investigate, the audience is treated to Kane's life.  From being taken from his real parents to rising to being the best of the best in journalism.  And ultimately his downfall.  We see as Kane lives his life and becomes of the most iconic people in the world.  We meet several people and learn to really appreciate Kane as a character.  The movie keeps plowing forward until we the audience learn just what Rosebud really is.  It may not seem like much from the get go, but the screenplay in and of itself really plays out really well.  As we learn about Kane we're willing to be taken for a ride.  The last scene in particular--when we learn what Rosebud is--is a really fantastic scene in and of itself.<br /><br />Yet there were certain things about Citizen Kane that made it unique for its time.  The first is that the movie is essentially a host of flashbacks telling the story of Charles Foster Kane.  It spans so much time, but it gets through it quickly.  Again, it seems like no big deal to us, but the way Orson Welles does it is still a technique very few do.  Even though time is passing in Kane's life, we hardly get that sense.  The time periods seem to mesh together because rather than tons of hardcuts we're mostly treated to it fading through his life, sometimes even in the same room.  Another technique that was done really well that was introduced by Citizen Kane was using makeup to make the characters age.  This, of course, is still done to this day.  The final technique that was quite astounding was the film's camera work.  Again, not a big deal in this day and age, but consider that Citizen Kane truly showed people you could do things with simple cuts and edits and pan shots.  For example, being able to see everything in the background foreground etc. in sharp, clear focus.  This was pretty amazing before.  If you take film classes, I'm sure you may get someone who goes on about this.  Citizen Kane's cinematography seems to be a favorite historical fact of many film buffs.<br /><br />It may also seem strange that the cinematography is praised because for the first time in a shot you can see the ceiling of a home.  This is because many films didn't get filmed on location.  Seeing things like this was quite an amazing achievement when Citizen Kane came out.  To put it simply, there's historical significance to what Citizen Kane did for film.  Of course, you don't exactly think of that these days when you think of Citizen Kane.  Most of us, of course, remember \\"Rosebud\\" and others of us remember that first scene.  Many of us (myself included) weren't even around when Citizen Kane was the big influence it was.  Put simple, Citizen Kane was like Star Wars.  So innovative and different for its time that it sort of lives on as a result.<br /><br />Of course, that also means that certain things about Citizen Kane are truly forgotten.  Unless you actually study film or read up on it, those who watch Citizen Kane now might be scratching their heads wondering just what the big deal is.  Indeed Citizen Kane does have things about it which might not bode well in this day and age.  The first being that Citizen Kane just feels long.  It's a two hour long movie, but I won't lie... it's boring.  It's an amazing film that everyone should see at least once, but it can be boring.  And it has little to do with special effects (which I'm not a big fan of anyway) or anything like that.  It's because the movie just moves at a snails pace.  It takes a lot of time to really develop Mr. Kane, but a lot of it can be very boring to watch.  Yet at the same time there are many exchanges that are quite interesting to watch.  The narrative in and of itself is very good.  It's just that... like I said, it's boring.  There are times when watching that you sort of feel like asking \\"Are we there yet?\\"  It's mostly in the middle when the film begins to drag, but as we move on, especially that last scene, the brilliance of the film's screenplay can be seen.<br /><br />With it's reputation of being among the greatest films ever made, it may surprise people to know that Citizen Kane didn't take home that Oscar for Best Picture.  In fact, of all the awards it was nominated for at the Academy Awards... it only won one.  For screenplay.  Despite all it's innovations in cinematography, art direction, and editing, Citizen Kane was never honored with an Oscar for any of these categories.  And when reading up on Citizen Kane you sort of get the feeling that perhaps the film was cheated out of those awards.<br /><br />In spite of it all, Citizen Kane is a movie worth viewing at least once if you're a big movie lover.  It's one of those movies that ought to be viewed not just for enjoyment, but perhaps for historical purposes as well.  It is nice to say that the story and narration have aged incredibly well and are still fondly influential.

B00005K3OT|4.0|A metaphorical tale of forbidden pleasure, set in 1959 France, with religious, romantic, and social themes.  A story of how one strong woman slowly changes an entire town by responding to thievery, accusations, and threats with patience, gentle kindness, and affection.  Excellent casting and character development, and an excellent ending.  Mild language, sexual suggestiveness, and one short violent scene.
1594202249|5.0|For those who have not been brave enough to try Pynchon, there is now a great place to start - Inherent Vice. While Pynchon experts can point out characters and styles that refer to his prior works, no previous reading is required to totally enjoy this book.<br /><br />We are given a microcosm of the 60's California scene via a very funny, noirish and sometimes bizarre tale of mischief and mayhem. Oddball characters, convoluted interactions and yes, sex, drugs and rock & roll are intertwined in a mystery (of sorts - it is Pynchon).<br /><br />If you are old enough to actually remember the era, you'll be taken on a tour of some things you most likely never experienced, but you maybe have hinted that you did.<br /><br />If your knowledge of the 60's is only from books and overheard stories at family reunions, don't judge everyone who was there by the events here. If very many had been a part of Pynchon's universe depicted in Inherent Vice, you might not be here to read this.<br /><br />Either way, Pynchon is still Pynchon - even if the ride is different from his others. Sit back and enjoy.
0802798225|5.0|I am so, so happy that I took a chance on this book. I usually stay in the romance section but I just so happen to come across this book in the young adult section and I must say the book was WONDERFUL. It brought back memories of when I was a teen and in love for the first time. It is rare that a book stays with you after you're done whether you're a young adult, a 20something like me, or older this is must definitely a must read.
B000002HRE|1.0|Ever had that feeling when you really like a band so much, you'll get the new album when it comes out and you're trying really hard to like it, making yourself think you do, but you wonder why it's so hard?  That's exactly how I felt about Reload when I was 16.  Young and stupid.  Times change, and so do people, so if the late 90s were characterized by nu metal and alternative rock, that was your bait for corporate opportunities.  Only after 3-4 years of obnoxious overplayed preppy alternative songs on the radio, especially off of this album, I decided to give up on Metallica and traded in all my CDs at the used record store.  I still like to thrash all around and act like a maniac every once in a while, but I also appreciate some artistic value in music.
0143144766|1.0|the readers for mason and dixon and against the day exhibit an attention to detailed nuances of the language that i found i couldn't really pickup on in a first reading -- but the reader for inherent vice actually dampens the text -- he just hurries through the words as if the plot actually mattered -- as opposed to the narrative voice and texture. it is really disappointing -- i wouldn't recommend it, but i would recommend the book -- there are just so many lovely touches in it, language-wise, that the reader muddies. he just hasn't spent enough time with the text before doing his performance. too bad.
B000P0J09W|4.0|The timeless appeal of Goonies is there for everyone and even kindergarden aged children will love it.  It has everything that you could wish for in a family movie, swashbuckling, pirate treasure, hidden tunnels, a mystery, and a group of kids that have to battle all the odds that threaten to tear them and their families apart.  Even after all these years, the story is still as fresh as it was when it was first released on the big screen.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I was a teenager when the Beatles came to America and I even saw them perform in Cleveland where the girls in the audience went absolutely nuts (as did the Fire Marshall).  My sister was just a little kid and came along too. She  became an even bigger Beatles fan than those of us who were teens.  Fittingly, she discovered the movie and album first and told me to get them.  I am so glad that I did.  This is other artists performing some of the most well known Beatles songs.  I absolutely love it and have spent many pleasant times listening to it behind the wheel of my convertible, top down, and these tunes playing again and again. I think this shows how very well written these songs were that they work for contemporary artists in another century so very well.  I loved the movie and couldn't wait to get my mitts on the album after seeing it.  Get this.

0061808121|5.0|Sissy Spacek takes one of the great American southern novels, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD by Harper Lee to an even more sublime level by perfectly becoming the narrator of the novel, Scout Finch.  Scout is only eight years old and the Great Depression is ongoing in Maycomb, Alabama.  Her father, Atticus, is a pivotal man in their town as he is the fairest lawyer in town.  Spacek does all the voices of these remarkable characters and they come even more alive for us.  The Finches are fortunate in this town as they are making it through the Depression in genteel if not affluent fashion.  The town is made of people like the Finches; and then what would be known today as poor white trash; and finally the blacks who still have decades to wait for racial equality to appear.  However, small town America provides certain basics in the 1930s. No one starves or is homeless yet vivid inequalities exist.  Also, disabilities are kept in your own home, shuttered up so that other people can't see your differences.  Boo Radley is one of these different, disabled people and Scout is fascinated by him as the Radleys live on her street. Boo will come to intersect with a terrible legal injustice which occurs in the town, a rape trial with a black man as the defendant and a poor white trash girl as the accuser.  Atticus Finch is the black man's lawyer.  But this novel is about so much more than a trial.  Lee and Spacek nail the universal frailties and strengths of all of us as human beings in her novel. Those haven't changed one iota between the Great Depression and present day. I enjoyed the movie and the novel when I was a kid and I did not revisit the work until recently as this audiobook.  It was a wonderful way to experience it all again in a new medium. If anyone who resists reading needs to learn this book for school, this audio version could be the perfect solution.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0375714669|4.0|There is much to like in Satrapi's graphic memoir of her growing up - her illustrations are clever, the angst and struggles she faces are brutally honest, and her story is intriguing.  I am a huge fan of [[ASIN:037571457X Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood]] and its portaryal of growing up in Iran in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  _Persepolis 2_ picks up where the previous story left off: Satrapi is in school in Vienna, struggling to fit in.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the angst of being a teen-ager that I found off-putting, but her memoir of life outside of Iran was neither as poignant nor as interesting to me as her previous work.  She remains witty and clever, and the xenophobia exhibited by the Viennese is palpable (and, sadly, true - in their defense, much of Europe struggles with immigration.)  Still, the effort and trials Satrapi faced as she grew into womanhood didn't resonate with me.  Becoming an adult is hard - doubly so far away from family, and even more so with the sense of guilt at leaving her native country in the midst of a war.  Perhaps these added issues made it hard for me to empathize with the author; or perhaps I was so impressed with her original work, no matter what she did I would have found it wanting.  To conclude with the idea that \\"the grass isn't always greener\\" seemed a bit trite.<br /><br />With that said, I do have a deeper appreciation of what the \\"children of the revolution\\" in Iran faced - and indeed are facing - as the result of her work.  An interesting, brief and easy read to be sure, but I recommend with reservation.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|Eli Roth enjoys a good horror flick, he particularly enjoys many forgotten gems that were utterly intrusive to the mind (as pointed out heavily in the documentary included). Roth has established the Hostel series not as a continuation to his figures or previous works, but as a whole new side step in mainstream horror films. His name is now renown enough to be displayed alongside the higher budget theater films. This recognition brings in a whole new group of viewers less equiped for what they are about to see. Unsurprisingly this film is viewed as a bit too rough for the mainstream, and despised by  quite a few horror fans (who feel they've been duped calling it mindless).<br /><br />Reassuringly stepping foot into the movie this way will lead to a bitter disliking of the film. Yes it is indeed sexual and gore torn. It is this ideal of dynamics between the two that help the movie groove along. Most films use attractive females and immensely muscular males to lure people in on an otherwise flop fest. Hostel makes use of the this by rendering the three main characters as epicurean males pursuing nothing but excess.<br /><br />This type of lifestyle is supposedly welcomed at the European inns otherwise known as Hostels. All wishes granted for those who enter expecting some promiscuity, everything is perfect, except for what the Hostels secretly stand for (and intend to do with said occupants). Many reviewers have gone on to spoil the story, while I deter from the review I would just like to say I'm not a fan of spoiling films. I will not spoil this one either. I will say a particular Hostel the trio of men arrive at seems a bit dubious when examined with its surrounding and historical buildings.<br /><br />Expect disturbing imagery if you think the Saw films are bad. Expect turning it off if you think gore festivities like the Halloween or Friday the Thirteenth remakes were roughing it.<br />No this film isn't a thinking mans horror for say, but the suspense and filming techniques sure do give a lot for a film people bash as 'mindless'. Film wise priorities are set, things happen for a reason not just some odd camera quirk, or guttural thinking.<br /><br />Here's a quick synopsis of the film:<br />Three backpackers travel amongst Europe's night life. Seeking nothing but pleasure, while they enjoy it they find themselves quickly being disliked and sought more. When the more is no longer a variable but an establish place on their map they seek it with little questions asked. Aboard the train they go.<br /><br />Exiting the train they find little of what was promised. The city didn't suggest parties it suggested poverty. They do indeed find their dot on the map, one promised was kept another lavish Hostel.<br /><br />One of the three men is a bit older, and is quite the ladies man he always splits off. His departure only becomes more mysterious when look at the incentives. The other two are a bit more grounded one being the most cautious and the other a fun seeker who is also a pretty genuine person. This is where the movie shifts gears becoming more the horror it was intended to be (full of torture scenes). How is it torture scenes? Whats the motive? Watch the movie, again I don't wish to spoil.<br /><br />Okay my quick run through is over and back to the critique now that everyone has a bit more of an insight. The film can definitely make someone squeamish. Usage of nearly anything a sick twisted mind could lay hands on is available as means of torture. Victims are left to whatever the the torturer is feeling like for the day. What sets this film apart is instead of constantly on the move to escape peril scenes are replaced with... Well close ups of torture, ones stuck in the chambers have no hope only mercy. These secretive locations are derelict rusted buildings where no one can hear you cry outside the walls.<br />Nearing the end we do get an adrenalin pumped escape attempt.<br /><br />The movie is pretty short, viewing the sequel right after (if you enjoyed this to begin with) does justice to the lengthiness. If the movie applied itself right to you and atmospheric conditions are conditioned right this should haunt your mind for some time. The beginnings moderate pace leading up to the slaughterhouse terrorizing climax is friction heated launched and landing with an impact.lengthiness.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|this movie is probably the best movie out this year as far as complete story, action, drama, and humor all put together. the writers did a magnificent job in adding all the elements and making it work. the coolest part is that spok is in here, the original spok. all the actors and actresses did a wonderful job playing the role and to me this movie did an excellent job on pulling people into the franchise that dont know anything about star trek what so ever. me myself am not a star trek fan but this movie broke new grounds for anybody who isnt a trekkie! yo ima get this def when it comes out.
B001GCUO16|3.0|it could have been better... way better. it doesnt really do a good job of explaining actually everything about wolverine. sometimes it does make things connect with the first movie well but it still leaves you wondering so many things like how is it wolverine never aged anymore after the way he looks now. i mean he was born like hundreds of years ago. the story isnt bad it just isnt complete to me. the action is not bad but to me it was subpar... maybe i need to watch it a few more times and review it again... lmao
B000E6EGXM|5.0|This is the best recording of the War Requiem by far.  For Britten, a life-long pacifist, this was his most explicit anti-war statement.  And it is packed with symbolism, from the poems by Wilfred Owen (\\"My subject is War, and the pity of War.  The Poetry is in the pity ...\\"), to the pick of soloists, a German (Fischer-Dieskau), an Englishman (Pears) and a Russian (Vishnevskaya - not at the first performance), to its premier in the rebuilt Coventry Cathedral in 1962.  The composer's response to the devastation of war, the bombings of Coventry itself, London, Dresden, Berlin, the siege at Leningrad (St. Petersburg), etc...     One reviewer referred to the work as \\"grating and discordant\\", as well it should be.  In Owen's words, \\"Only the monstrous anger of the guns.\\"  It is about the horrors of war after all !  Apparently he or she didn't bother to listen to the last section of the Libera me, \\"Let us sleep now\\", a disturbingly quiet, gentle, and ironic end to suffering.    Conducted by the composer, this is the War Requiem to have if you want to get to the heart and ache of this piece.  The London Symphony Orchestra play superbly, and the soloists are committed and in superb voice, even Pears who more often disappoints.  The Decca/London recording, the first of this work, although dating from 1963, is clear and bright.  And it can now be purchased at a much reduced price.      Hickox's interpretation with the same LSO (Chandos), with a superb cast of soloists (Harper, Langridge and Shirley-Quirk), is rightly admired but it lacks the immediacy of this recording.  It may have better sonics but it misses the historic, emotional, context of Britten's effort.  Both are excellent versions.  A toss up.
0307269981|5.0|I promised myself after finishing the first novel in the Millennium trilogy that I would not start this, the second book in the series, until the third was available for purchase. I didn't want to have that vague feeling of bereavement that comes when finishing an utterly engrossing book involving characters that have become familiar and for whom, and this probably sounds ridiculous, it is possible to feel an element of affection. The `good guys', at any rate, are people who, were you to meet them in real life, you feel you would like to get to know better. They are intelligent, sympathetic, motivated, for the most part, by a higher moral code than mere financial gain and supremely competent at what they do, which is getting the bad guys! And all of this is still true of the superficially nihilistic Salander.<br /><br />There are certain structural inconsistencies within this book that might be explained by the author's sudden death and some may find this, shall we say, irritating?  I didn't and contented myself with the thought that the plusses so far outweigh the minuses that it would churlish to gripe!  Larsson's talent in creating these characters and setting them in high tech yet plausible environments is obvious almost from the first paragraph of the first book and is matched by the skill necessary to provide a structure and narrative drive that produces something that truly can be described as `un-put-downable'! Book lovers everywhere should lament the loss of such a rare talent.<br /><br />As you can see, when the temptation is so great, promises are sometimes difficult to keep!
B000002UB6|4.0|Clocking in at just over 35 minutes, \\"Let It Be\\" possesses the stripped-down sound of The Beatles not heard since the days of albums like \\"Please Please Me,\\" \\"With the Beatles\\" and \\"Beatles for Sale,\\" the band's first three records. Due to major internal strife and restlessness, the \\"Let It Be\\" recording sessions were left in massive disarray on the cutting-board table for producer Phil Spector to sort out, and man did he do a heck of a job. Kudos go to Spector for painstakingly constructing a fine Beatles record out of very rough sessions, a fantastic curtain call that was designed to be the soundtrack to the movie \\"Let It Be.\\"<br /><br />All told, this stuff is better than the band's first three albums, and the joy within the songs gives no indication to the casual listener that The Beatles were ready to throw in the towel. There's a folksy charm to tunes like \\"Two of Us,\\" \\"Dig a Pony\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\" (only the Beatles could write and sing such an irresistibly catchy chorus using those three short words). As usual, John Lennon and Paul McCartney are credited with most of the writing, and egos and anger toward one another aside, they sound as telekinetic and beguiling as ever, making the future breakup even more unfortunate. Interestingly, the chorus of \\"Dig a Pony\\" is reminiscent of The Beatles classic \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" -- the version sung by Joe Cocker, not Ringo Starr.<br /><br />\\"Let It Be\\" also has a few moments of Lennon's hazy but beautiful aura, like on the gem \\"Across the Universe;\\" and the record's title track, a major hit that has McCartney's pop-inflected influence all over it, is a beloved sing-along classic. The other hits on the CD are \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Get Back.\\" Disappointingly, the two songs on the album where everybody in the band contributed to the writing process (the Rolling Stones-like \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\") are way too short to even take seriously. But rousing, Motown- and blues-influenced numbers like \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" (where McCartney's vocals really shine), \\"One After 909\\" and \\"For You Blue\\" are clear indicators that The Beatles had plenty of spunk left toward the end of their career, even if they did hate each other by then.ing\\" (where McCartney's vocals really shine), \\"One After 909\\" and \\"For You Blue\\" are clear indicators that The Beatles had plenty of spunk left toward the end of their career, even if they did hate each other by then.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I just received my Ultimate Collection today, a month and a half after ordering it, which is fine...it's worth the wait. The 4 music CDs are arranged from oldest songs to newest, starting with the wonderful Jackson 5 hits and ending with Mike's more recent jams. Stuffed among all of your favorite songs are demos and un-released music. I'm not talkin filler either.  These are new songs to love. Almost 60 tracks in total.<br /><br />The biggest surprise is that disc 5 is actually a full-length concert dvd! Live in Bucharest, The Dangerous Tour. I thought I was getting music videos. The 60-page half-panel book is great with countless photos and a nice write-up about Michael's journey to mega-stardom, including a bio, song and award chronology and Michael's own shout-outs. My only negative comment is that the gold embossed images of Mike rub off very easily. Just setting it down on a table causes tiny dots of gold to come off. This product lives up to it's name. Order it now!<br /><br />Long live the King of Pop!<br />I love you Michael.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|The Beatles' astounding body of work stands on its own, but \\"Love\\" injects new life into a slew of the Fab Four's most well-known tunes, a shot of sonic creativeness that was used to accompany a Cirque de Soleil stage show. The masterminds behind this successful studio venture were famed Beatles producer George Martin and son Giles, both of whom outdid themselves. Though the entire CD doesn't retain the frantic, connect-the-dots magic of the beginning portions, \\"Love\\" is a unique, expertly spliced work of art that can proudly stand next to The Beatles' best, most innovative material.<br /><br />\\"Love\\" begins with the solitary, beautifully harmonized vocals of the boys singing \\"Because,\\" a somehow lonely, hopeful and bountiful sound all at once; it ends with John Lennon's famously repetitive plea of \\"All You Need is Love.\\" In between is The Beatles at their best -- with a constant twist of studio mastery to keep things interesting. Following \\"Because,\\" the album picks up the pace with Ringo Starr's on-the-spot, busy drumming, the smooth rhythmic guitar to open \\"Get Back\\" and Paul McCartney's assured voice and lyrics. For me, the best moments of \\"Love\\" start with the frenzied screaming of teenaged girls to open \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and end with the flawless conjoining of \\"Drive My Car,\\" \\"The Word\\" and \\"What You're Doing,\\" an unlikely combination of songs that comes off as soulful, fluent and fun.<br /><br />Other listeners will likely pick other moments on \\"Love\\" that take their breath away, because there's something for everybody here. The Beatles well-known hits are all dutifully represented, and if anything, I would have preferred the inclusion of a few more obscure tracks, like the one at the end of \\"Come Together.\\" Then again, you can't go wrong with Beatles tunes that stand the test of time: Harrison's \\"Something\\" is romance on steroids; Lennon's \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is stripped a bit of its original haziness but still a melodic trip; McCartney's \\"Lady Madonna\\" is a buoyant masterpiece that would get anyone's juices flowing; and the rocking \\"Revolution,\\" mournful \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and sing-along classic \\"Hey Jude\\" provide the organic bedrock to \\"Love's\\" polished persona. Why leave these timeless songs off? And through it all, the album's effortless vibe is a testament to the stellar production by Martin and Martin.<br /><br />Along with easy-on-the-ears tunefulness, The Beatles' sound could also be stately and pristine, overtly British. At the same time, they were an exciting, raw band that often pushed the limits. \\"Love\\" captures that dichotomy and luckily does not come off as contrived, overdone or like a lazy greatest hits effort. In fact, if you've never heard much from The Beatles, \\"Love\\" is a terrific way to jump right in.a\\" is a buoyant masterpiece that would get anyone's juices flowing; and the rocking \\"Revolution,\\" mournful \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and sing-along classic \\"Hey Jude\\" provide the organic bedrock to \\"Love's\\" polished persona.

B000002KOO|5.0|Yes, that's the saying from which Fleetwood Mac named their third album in 1969.  Curious, but play on they did.  And in doing so created what is ultimately the masterpiece for the Mark II line up of Fleetwood Mac.  This would be the last album to feature founding member and leader Peter Green (though he did make an uncredited appearance on 1973's \\"Penguin\\").  Peter went out in style....musically speaking, not personally.  No longer content to just play Chicago style blues, Peter was adamant to branch out and try new things.  Mick Fleetwood states that \\"Then Play On\\" is Fleetwood Mac's first true album and is one of his favorites.  The album is missing one member however, guitarist Jeremy Spencer.  The band had originally planned to release an E.P. simultaneously with the album by the band's alter ego, Earl Vince and The Valiants, led by Jeremy Spencer.  The E.P. was to be a take off on American radio programs featuring Jeremy as \\"Bill Schlitz,\\" the host.  The program featured Jeremy posing as different bands who were supposedly appearing on the radio show (one of them being a San Francisco psychedelic rock band called \\"The Electric Orange Squitters\\" followed by a hilarious imitation by Jeremy of British blues rocker John Mayall).  The entire E.P. can be heard on \\"The Vaudeville Years: 1968-1970\\" double CD set.  Jeremy's absence did not hamper the album though.  Peter and Daniel Kirwan's material made for a startling, innovative record that was entertaining from start to finish and that only slightly touched on the blues style the band was known for at this point.      However, fans of this album have been deprived of the original layout for \\"Then Play On\\" since 1970!  The album was released in the U.K in September of 1969 and in October for the U.S.  Both releases featured a very different track sequence when originally first issued.  For the first U.S. release, Reprise omitted Daniel Kirwan's \\"One Sunny Day\\" and \\"Without You,\\" both of which had already seen American release by Epic Records on \\"English Rose.\\"  The original U.S. track sequence, released October 1969, was as follows:    1.  Coming Your Way  2.  Closing My Eyes  3.  Fighting For Madge  4.  When You Say  5.  Show-Biz Blues  6.  Underway  7.  Although The Sun Is Shining  8.  Rattlesnake Shake  9.  Searching For Madge  10. My Dream  11. Like Crying  12. Before The Beginning    In September/November of 1969, the band released \\"Oh Well Pt. 1&2\\" as the A and B side of their non-album single.  The song was a hit in both the U.K. and the U.S., so Reprise decided to cash in on the single's success and re-release \\"Then Play On\\" with a track sequence to include \\"Oh Well\\" sometime in early 1970.  Both \\"When You Say\\" and the beautiful \\"My Dream\\" were cut from the track line up and \\"Oh Well\\" was tacked onto the end of side one.  \\"Show-Biz Blues\\" was now moved up to track 3 on the first side, \\"Fighting For Madge\\" was now sequenced directly AFTER \\"Searching For Madge\\" on side two.  Reprise managed to make a mess of a band's masterpiece by being money hungry.  It's a shame because if you've heard the original version of the album, you'll be astounded by how much more evenly it flows and makes sense.  For a smoother and more enjoyable ride, program your CD with the original track line up listed above and place \\"Oh Well\\" either after \\"Underway\\" or at the very end.  I prefer it after \\"Underway\\" myself.    Green had five songs on the original release, six if you count \\"Oh Well.\\"  Daniel Kirwan also had five songs, with the \\"Madge\\" jams being credited one each to John McVie and Mick Fleetwood.  Both Peter and Daniel's songs gave each a run for their money!  Daniel showcased his heavier side with the jungle beat driven \\"Coming Your Way\\" but for the most part, Daniel's songs are more gentle in nature.  Those being the sad \\"When You Say,\\" the instrumental \\"My Dream,\\" the bluesy \\"Like Crying,\\" and the crooner styled \\"Although The Sun Is Shining.\\"  Peter starts off his songs with the haunting, near the point of death tinged \\"Closing My Eyes.\\"  He follows that with the down home blues of \\"Show-Biz Blues,\\" the Hendrix like instrumental \\"Underway,\\" and the re-release features his magnum opus \\"Oh Well.\\"  On side two, he managed one of the first overtly descriptive songs about male masturbation with \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" (\\"Now I know this guy.  His name is Mick.  Now he don't care if he ain't got no chick!\\") and again back to his death bed with the ghostly \\"Before The Beginning.\\"  Both of the \\"Madge\\" jams are heavy and spliced into sections for a fun listen (at one point a bizarre orchestra interlude comes barreling forth into the song for no reason at all).      By all accounts \\"Then Play On\\" is one of Fleetwood Mac's best and definitely the best album from their early years.  No Fleetwood Mac collection is complete without this one so it has my highest recommendation!  The Fleetwood Mac Reprise catalog from 1969 to 1974 is long overdue for a proper, updated remastering job with \\"Then Play On\\" especially needing some attention!  Reprise/Rhino Records....are you reading this?!

1442135034|5.0|The plot of this book on the surface does not seem necessarily like it would engender a classic: a family with a caustic father, a loving mother and a youngest son who despises his father and in this particular instance wants to visit a lighthouse out in the ocean, a desire his father opposes. However, Woolf infuses this story with her fabulous (I think) writing style and a breadth of insights and observations that leave one fascinated and thinking throughout. Her writing style includes long sentences and a flow consciousness that some might find too burdensome. Somehow her writing reminds me of Sylvia Plath, with that same brilliance of wordplay. Quite simply it is a great book.

B0007TKNIS|3.0|First things first, mostly cause it annoys me when people say this, the Phantom of the Opera is a MUSICAL people, not an opera.  I will say it again: it is a musical about a phantom who \\"haunts\\" an opera house, it is not an opera.  That said...  This movie was a solid three.  It wasn't terrible but it wasn't that great.  The sets are beautiful, the costumes fabulous, but the casting was bad and the lip-syncing very bad.  Gerard Butler, an actor I usually love to watch, was a horrible Phantom.  I give him a lot of credit for singing the part himself, but he fell short.  Big time.  There were times when his accent slipped through (normally I love his accent, but not as the Phantom), he screamed a lot of his notes, didn't support his voice and sounded almost breathy at times.  As for Emmy Rossum, she sounds like a child, but considering she was 16 when this was made, it doesn't truly surprise me.  I don't have a problem with Patrick Wilson other than I just don't like his voice.  The only saving grace casting wise is Minnie Driver who is the best character in the entire movie and makes it worth watching.  That said, I love the music in the movie, in spite of the singers, and watch it mostly to listen to it.  At least I did until I bought the soundtrack.  It's one of those movies that I would suggest renting first and only buying it if you like it.

B001OQCV9M|4.0|I've been eagerly awaiting Julie and Julia. Not that I'm a huge follower of Julia. I remember her from my childhood...the quirky voice, the occasional glimpse of her on our small screen television. My mom didn't own \\"The Book\\" (the 1961 version of Mastering the Art of French Cooking Volume 1) or if she did, I never was allowed to touch it. Julie Powell's book Julie and Julia enticed me. I'm a blogger so Julie Powell's blogging adventure intrigued me. I was disappointed in the lack of Julia in Powell's memoir. And a little overwhelmed by some of the things that took up space that Julia could've filled.<br /><br />The movie. Ah. On one hand I can say that I loved it. Feel good? Check. Two women, different generations, situations and struggles taking life by the throat and just doing it. Check. Definitely feel good. I loved the supportive and loving men in the lives of Julie and Julia. Meryl Streep, in an enchanting performance, oozes goodwill and charm, embracing life as a generous and lifesized Julia Child. Several scenes were laugh outloud funny, others poignant, and I would have been content with the story of Julia Child. Period. The film even included a Dan Akroyd as Julia Child laugh moment and remake scenes of The French Chef ala Meryl.<br /><br />Julie Powell's life, on the other hand, lacked a bit. Amy Adams, as Julie Powell, weeping on the floor was very amusing. But there was a disconnect somewhere... in the script, the interpretation, or the tainting in my own mind by having read her memoir. Julie Powell, on the big screen, came across as whiny, weak and fragile. The book Julie Powell (I've not read the blog, so I can't compare there) is a don't-like-it-then-you-know-where-to-shove-it woman with frequent outbursts that seemed to be rages rather than insecurities. The movie Julie Powell discusses her \\"_ itchiness\\" with a friend. But she doesn't pull off _itch, this character is not a mean girl. And that's probably really the issue. Powell is honest in her memoir, sometimes horrifyingly honest, but it causes a grudging admiration. And she's funny, witty, sarcastic and descriptive which makes her readable and likable on another level. The film didn't pull that out of the character and so we are left with kind of a \\"who cares\\" or \\"that's nice\\" secondary scenario in which a girl becomes a woman while following Julia's recipe for a full life.

0743270754|5.0|Team of Rivals is the definitive account on the domestic politics of the Civil War.  While extolling the virtues of Lincoln's political ability to array a diverse and disparate set of political and personal viewpoints amongst his cabinet, Goodwin displays how these combination's preserved the domestic peace throughout the war.  She provides a striking human look at Lincoln and even many of his biographers do not achieve.  While I do agree with the other summaries that this book does not necessarily present new information I feel it is worth noting that it synthesizes many books into one and provides a useful stopping point for those who want to quickly assess the domestic situation in the civil war.    This book also provides excellent background on the key members of Lincolns cabinet including Seward (State), Chase (Treasury), Stanton and Cameron (War), and Bates  (AG).  These men representing the spectrum of political parties and factions at the time represented a unity that many did not think was possible.  Lincoln's strategy of giving power to his political enemies allowed him to unify his detractors and proceed with a war that was contentious from the start.  Overall this is an excellent addition to the scholarship on Lincoln and well worth the time to read.
B001E3AXGS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The book did a great job in covering Lincoln and his cabinet through some rough years in our history. While the book does address the civil war it does a great job at staying focused on Lincoln and his advisers and his person struggles. The book also does a good job and shedding additional light on events like the assassination which everyone knows about but few know these other details. If you like history, I highly recommend.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|BABEL is one of those films that are not often made anymore, and it takes a non-American director to bring it off. It is good to see in this age of TRANSFORMERS and X-MEN and Bruce Willis action pieces that we can still have movies that are about ideas, not just escapism.<br /><br />The reviewer for Amazon, Sam Graham, is spot-on in his analysis and overview. This is clearly not a film  for everyone -- only for those of us who who care to think and who recognize that lack of communication is a central problem throughout the world. Americans are not the only ones who often fail to see what is going on under their noses, and who can realize that small issues can quickly escalate into monumental ones. A mistake, such as taking the children of an American couple across the border into Mexico, quickly grows into a life-threatening event, and the parents of the children, who we don't realize until later, are Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette -- tourists in North Africa who must resort to some difficult-to-watch crude surgery. That those top-billed stars in what is an ensemble piece are not given the full-focus of the long film is not the point. This is not a pretty-boy movie, or even a pretty movie. It is gritty and real, and all of the characters are shown as having clay feet.<br /><br />If we think that we are really in charge of our lives, we need to think again. At any moment, something can happen which can throw what we think are our self-absorbed and ordered existences into a tail spin -- often because of our own short-sighted perspectives and often because of someone's else's -- wherever they happen to be in the world. The rifle fired carelessly by the boy is the center piece -- the center of the spider web, but the rest of the web strands may seem to be unconnected to the rest until near the end. The story in Japan seems to be unrelated to the other stories until we discover that the rifle used by the boys halfway around the world is one that the father of the deaf-mute originally furnished. Dismiss this as the butterfly effect if you wish, but the connections exist if we are careful enough to look.<br /><br />The story about the deaf-mute girl in Japan (portrayed by Rinko Kikuchi who was, as she should have been, nominated for an Academy Award) is not as separate as we might first think. In fact, it is her inability to communicate with her father and her friends in an area of the world where personal defects are looked down upon by peers that turns out to be a microcosm for the entire, far-flung story. Her frustration is the distillation of what is wrong with all of us -- we don't take to listen to, or understand, others around us. As a professor who has taught in China for many years and has learned how personal ailments and birth defects are sometimes looked down upon as reflecting weaknesses in character, I understood the Japanese girl's painful frustration. Boys ignore her because she cannot speak to them, and even her father, until the very end in a touching finale, is unable to comprehend her needs and angst. She wants and needs to be recognized as a human being, even if it means only being a sexual being. She, like most of us, needs to be understood for who we are and not expected to be exactly like everyone else.<br /><br />For obvious reasons, I did not show the film in class to Chinese students, but I did loan it to a former female student. She asked me in an Instant Message why the girl showed, as she put it, her beaver to the boys in public. I told her that she felt that since she could not be noticed as a teenage girl wanting to fit in with the others, she would show herself as a sexual object, which is what, she felt, the boys only cared about. She would get attention in the only way she knew how, even if it meant making sexual overtures to a mature dentist or to a police officer who comes to her home in her father's absence. Of course, she is reeling from the death of her mother and even makes up her own versionto explain her untimely demise, but her issues are even deeper and more inward-focused than that.<br /><br />Even the Brad Pitt character learns that some people, even in a third-world nation, are not interested in helping others for a reward. When he offers money to the man who has helped save his wife's life, he is amazed when his money is rejected. Even in these days of constant terror threats, some people -- in any corner of the globe -- are still human and, more importantly, humane. This humble native of Morocco is not like Pitt's fellow tourists who want to get on with their trip; he is selfless and resourceful, willing to help an American tourist whose wife's life is threatened.<br /><br />That this film ends with the deaf-mute girl standing nude on the terrace with her father is perfect because it exemplifies the theme of the entire, skillfully woven tapestry. If we don't communicate with others and reconcile our differences -- whether real or perceived -- we are doomed to live in isolation.<br /><br />When BABEL was overlooked for an Academy Award in favor of the Martin Scorsese film THE DEPARTED, an American remake of a Japanese film, I was disappointed but not surprised. After all, that gangster film, full of violence and vile language, was more accessible to the American public. It was easier to accept a film full of pretty boys and the scene-stealing Jack Nicholson, people who settle their differences by shooting each other, than a film where one single shot fired in stupidity can affect us so dramatically. It's like that uncanny Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game. See if you think we are all really unconnected from each other.but her issues are even deeper and more inward-focused than that.

B0026IA0QS|4.0|Presumably if you are on this page, then you know what the film is and want to know about the disc.  This is a Chineese release (NTSC Region 0) that will work fine in US players and unlike other Chineese releases there is not 20 minutes of worthless stuff before the menue.  This disc was obviously set up to be sold in the English market (no Chineese text anywhere).    The actual movie itself is the un-cut version but runs 120m or so due to uncorrected Pal speed up (I would presume?).  Nothing's missing I actually did scene by scene comparisons with the questionable parts and everything's there.   The film is anamorphic widescreen and looks infinately better than the old VHS tapes.  The sound is fine with a stereo 2.0 track and a 5.1 track but unfortunately doesn't contain the commentery from the region 2 Anchor Bay Relese.  A minor annoyance is that there are only 6 chapter breaks for a film so long.    The second disc contains:Louis Mouchet's Documentary \\"La Constellation Jodorowsky\\"; A Filmed On Stage Interview with Jodorowsky; Deleted Scene With Commentary; \\"Echek\\" A Short Film Directed by Adan Jodorowsky (son of Alejandro and one of the stars of Santa Sangre.      I'm not sure if this is a legitimate relese or not but untill some one makes a proper region 1 disc, I'd reccommend this cheaper priced version.  Unless you are obsessed with Jodorowsky \\"spill everything over-analytical\\" commenteries.
B0019LY5I2|4.0|When a director's crowning achievement was the first Mummy film, you know how high to set your expectations, but I am happy to say that this film is better than both the Mummy movies and Van Helsing by far. G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra is loud and the action never quits, but the sense of fun here is contagious. Unlike Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, this flick isn't a chore to sit through. Most of the acting is pretty good for this type of film and the CGI is top notch majority of the time. The action scenes also seemed really fresh and exciting, which is hard to do nowadays. On top of all that, Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols are both super hot, which only makes every scene they are in that much better.<br /><br />I grew up playing with G.I. Joe action figures. In fact I still have boxes full of them up in the attic and numerous vehicles scattered about and tucked away somewhere in the house. While this movie didn't bring out the kid in me enough to bust out the figures one more time, I was entertained from start to finish. It's well worth seeing in theaters, just check your brain at the door and allow this flick to help you forget about your daily life for two hours. I know I did.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B000006TRV|5.0|Though a long-time admirer of Pink Floyd music, I have to admit that my collection did NOT contain \\"The Wall\\". (I know: Shame on me!) So I finally decided to make the purchase and purchased the Deluxe Packaging Digitally Remastered version. I got ripped off! The shrink-wrap was labeled as such, but the web site description mentions 13 tracks for disc 1, and 20 tracks for disc 2, whereas mine has only 13 tracks for each disc. Where's the additional 7 tracks? The only thing I can figure is there is a mistake on the site and not the recording - you can preview (on disc 2) tracks 1-7 and 15-20 - a total of 13 tracks. Tracks 8-14 are repeat titles of 1-7, so that may explain it.    The reason I purchased the recording was to hear \\"The Wall\\" - extra tracks or no. I'm disappointed that the extra tracks described on the site don't exist. But fans of Pink Floyd will LOVE the album regardless - and I do. The album is NOT meant to be played on an iPod, with cheap bud-style headphones, at 128bit or less. Put it on a GOOD stereo and CRANK it up! You won't be disappointed. Truly amazing!
031606792X|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book that I kept my husband captive for a half an hour making him listen to my outpouring of anger, disapointments and all the things I found wrong with all four books.  I read the first three books and found them entertaining, a guilty pleasure that I couldn't turn away from without finding out what happens.  I wish I didn't go on to find out what happened.      *Potential Spoilers*    I had a lot of complaints, but I think they were covered pretty well by other reviewers.  My biggest problems:      1,  All the characters turned into cardboard cutouts of their previous selves.  How could SMeyer kill (not literally of course) all her characters so heartlessly?  I feel like as a reader I was more invested in her characters than she was.      2.  Jacob stole Bella from Edward even after they were married (Bella's face lighting up every time he walked in the room)and then stole his only child.  Good grief, he was even there in the birthing room with them, just like he was there at their wedding, stealing scenes and his wife's attention.  And did anyone notice that the kid was always either with Bella or Jacob, but never with Edward?  At the end when Edward goes to meet the Volturi it doesn't upset Nessie one bit.  But when the Volturi start advancing on them Nessie reaches over from Bella's arms to grab a handfull of Jacob's fur.  Shouldn't the kid be more worried about her father and seeking her supposedly last comfort from him?  Edward should have kicked Jacob's ass a long time ago, not calling him \\"Son\\".  Then divorced Bella and maybe hooked up with Tanya (another cardboard character, but seemed to at least have a backbone).      3.  The entire plot is contrived, pat and took forever to draw out.  It would have been sad if someone died, but so satisfying as a reader.      4.  What happened to the love between Edward and Bella?  Where is the their shared joy in their (albiet creepy) little girl?      5.  The birth scene with the ripped open uterus (by Edward, using his teeth) and blood gushing out of Bella's mouth.  We waited for four books to see this vampire transformation?  Surely SMeyer could have done better.  I could have done better.      If you must read it prepare to be disappointed.  And prepare to fight the urge to run out back to set fire to all four books.  It's that much of a let down.
B00164KYV4|4.0|As a woman in her early 40's I wasn't sure if I would be able to relate to the movie, as the characters are all many years younger than me. But I did. I really liked the beginning with the realization of how girls are truly programmed to believe that if a boy treats her badly, he 'really likes her and is just hiding it.' No wonder so many women stay in unhealthy relationships - not trying to preach but it really is a no brainer about how we brain-wash ourselves and our friends to feel better, when we really are not helping anyone at all.<br /><br />The movie tackles dating and couples full force. It allows the characters to each go through different elements of the process and though it categorizes each one without a lot of room to change,(the neurotic female on the prowl, waiting for the call; the puppy dog male whose love is not recipricated but taken advantage of; the girlfriend waiting, not so patiently, for an engagement ring) change actually does occur. Each character has his/her own epiphany about relationship and his/her role in the failure or success.<br /><br />This movie is a good friends movie, as you will want to talk about it during and after, to compare your own memories with what you saw on screen. I liked the ending, as there was closure. Not all is good, which I believe is more accturate than a fairy tale, happily ever after. Yet, even in the bad, there is some positive, as some characters find themselves and learn that being alone is not the same as lonely and being independent and strong is a pretty atractive in its own right.

B000TU16GS|2.0|You ever seen any James Bond movies? Or, for that matter, any spy movies, or read any spy novels? If you have, you've already read \\"Stormbreaker,\\" and probably needn't bother with it.    This book was just not that good. It was well-written from a technical angle, and the main character, Alex Rider, is reasonably interesting. But otherwise? Bond Villains usually have better schemes than the bad guy in this one. They certainly tend to have better rationales for what they're doing.    Aside from those facts, though, this is basically a Bond novel where Bond is fourteen. We have MI6, we have what is basically Q, we have the gadgets, we even have the Talking Villain who is more than willing to tell the hero his plan and then wander off while his henchman is supposed to kill the hero. I thought we left that behind us with Doctor Evil.    This of course isn't even touching on elements of plausibility. Sure, MI6 is really willing to recruit fourteen-year-old boys. Not to mention the level of pre-training training Alex Rider gets. He speaks several languages, has a black belt, is in nearly perfect physical condition, etc, etc. It's explained away by his spy uncle giving him this training. I'm willing to bet in the real world, spies don't generally train kids like this. Well, unless they work for al-Qaeda, then they just teach them to blow things up.    I suppose if you're a teenager you might like this. I probably would've when I was a teenage boy. But there's so many better books that one can read. This one is just worth avoiding.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Brainwashed is an excellent album that is easier to consider when its author has not so recently died.  George Harrison touched many people and his death probably did not allow for an objective view of his last record.  It is as excellent as billed, if not more, but we now know it is not just sorrow that makes us say this.  There are many great songs and in them, George, the critic of the material world is alive and well.  His overall view of the need for faith in God shines through.  His vision of God was a Hindu one to be sure, but it nevertheless has much in common with the Christian view of God as well.  As a result, much of what he says is sympathetic to the Christian mind, while it is rejected by the secular one.  I thank God for George Harrison and I recommend his last album for what it teaches and says about the man.
B0015WJBR0|5.0|OK--if you're reading this,then you hopefully stumbled upon the band somewhere online or through suggestion by a prog loving music friend/aquaintance. Here's the deal: Are you a big fan of early 70's prog like Yes,Genesis,Renaissance,or even early Ambrosia or later Beatles? And do you love lots of lush 3-4 part harmonies in your music? Well,Moon Safari manage to cover all this ground and more in their songs.The band writes simply thee most melodic progrock music to come along since..well,any of the aforementioned bands! Sure,there have been many highly-touted comparisons along the way. But these guys are the real deal. Their songs,often very long (one on this awesome double cd is over 30 minutes long!) are NEVER boring and so uplifting,that you can't help but smile whilst listening! But there ARE shorter songs,too. Someone else mentioned a relate to 'Beach Boys' harmonies--not that far off. Couple this with great melodic prog (not heavy,but not acoustic either),lush 70's keyboard flourishes,and great arrangements (yes,even the longer tunes) along with a very positive approach to their music,and you can't help but love this band! you may want to search out a 'nicer' price online,as this IS an import,after all (they're from Sweden). But well worth having, this Blomljud cd (means 'Flower Sound' in Swedish). And I highly recommend their debut titled 'A Doorway To Summer' as well. We've been waiting for decades for a band like this. Check them out & you'll see why! Enjoy, T

B000007638|5.0|We can only consider these albums as snap shots in time. Macca had reinvented himself after The Beatles, he'd created a new image (Wings) a new music catalogue that stood up by themselves and a new sound, putting the Beatle era behind him as he moved into the looser disco era. The first solo album 'McCartney' was his rebirth and this album, 'Wings Over America' was the culmination of everything in a cracking live performance. Its as if the album says 'here, this is what I've done, who I am and what I can now do'. And it works 100%. Its vibrant and exciting, its a man on top of his trade. Buy it and you wont be disappointed. I first bought it too many years ago on vynal and here I am now buying it again on CD...    BTW, I saw Wings in Liverpool back in '79, his first concert back home. Electric atmosphere, he played his new album 'Back to the Egg' stuff.... lights out, single chair and spotlight, strum, strum 'Yesterday...'. I think all Liverpool cried that night, the lad had come home. Cheers for the memories Macca, not bad for a scally.

B000ZN802W|5.0|Into the Wild is NOT your typical \\"guy is lost in the middle of nowhere and can't find his way home\\" type adventure movies.  This one is a little bit different from that.    This movie is more about a loner guy who leaves his mom, dad, and sister and goes through life trying to survive without them as soon as college is over.  He travels all across America, meeting different people and going through new experiences each time.  Throughout the movie you can't wait to find out where he ends up next.    This is one really good movie.   I didn't expect the storyline to grab me as much as it did.  The ending was incredibly sad, and was somewhat of a twist if you ask me because I did NOT see it coming.  I thought the story was going one way, and it went completely the other way.  In fact, there were a couple different things at the end that were sad to me.      But sadness aside, the first two hours of the movie were pure excitement.  The acting was incredible from all the characters, and I think everyone can find something to like about the storytelling because it comes across in such an easy to understand, logical, and likeable way.  You just keep pulling for the main character and all the objects that get in his way to find out how he handles them.    The only problem is that freakin' Eddie Vedder does the soundtrack for the movie, which means all the emotional scenes in the film feature Eddie's distinct style.  I'm not a fan of his music (or Pearl Jam) so I find his singing more of a distraction than anything.      Great movie.   You won't be disappointed.

0446581348|1.0|This book is probably best for a preteen or for someone who has absolutely positively no makeup experience/knowledge. I thought this book would provide insight into some more advanced makeup techniques, more graphs and how to looks. But only consisted of a few basic tutorials, which I didnt find very informative or well explained. I also didnt like that she only provided HER makeup line products, particularly colors that go well with a skin/hair/eye color.    anyway, this book was nothing what I expected, and it is certainly NOT for an advanced pro. It contained nothing that I couldnt/wouldnt be able to learn from beauty sites, blogs or forums.    I am returning this book.
031606792X|1.0|Since everyone else has basically covered all the reasons why this book was horrific, I am just going to mention one thing which, to me, was the cherry on top of the pile of you-know-what that was Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />[**I guess this could be considered a SPOILER**]<br /><br />Near the end, when all the vampire friends are congregating at Casa Cullen, when Jacob said something about needing an index to keep them all straight (I am not going to look up what exactly was said, because I gave away my copy), there was a footnote. Pointing to the index. SERIOUSLY? You seriously had a character IN THE BOOK say that the BOOK needed an index, then provided said index as a footnote? Come on. That's just dumb.

B001OQCV9M|4.0|What in the world does television and concocting-French-food-in-America pioneer Julia Child have in common with just 30-something government employee turned food blogger, Julie Powell?<br /><br />Other than the love of food, oodles of butter and a big project to fill the need for purpose, the two main characters in Nora Ephron's biopic, \\"Julie and Julia\\" share great marriages with men that are not put off by their mate's desire for self-identity defined by more than a few little bouts of self-absorption.  Like a good souffl&eacute;, Ephron folds the stories told in two books, Powell's \\"[[ASIN:031604251X Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously]]\\" and Child's \\"[[ASIN:0307277690 My Life in France]]\\" without deflating the overall mixture, although this reviewer would have enjoyed more scenes with the wonderfully talented Meryl Streep who redeems herself quite well (all high-pitched voice, champagne bubbly laughter and squared shoulders) as the indomitable and effusive Julia from her most un-defining role as Donna in that \\"[[ASIN:B001GKJ2DY Mamma Mia! The Movie (Widescreen)]]\\" debacle.<br /><br />Ephron depicts 1950s Paris with a foodie's appreciation for what that city did and still does for the world of cuisine--from the very first glimpse of Julia's luncheon of sole meuni&egrave;re--the waiter delectably filets the fish's sumptuous flesh tableside to the audiences' very audible groans of anticipation of and appreciation for its buttery taste, but she also does well by Long Island City and its tangle of grey-tinged tenements, elevated trains and apartments over pizza parlors.  Somehow, both Julie and Julia know where to get their ingredients and manage beat, chop (extremely amusing is a scene of Julia alongside a mountain of practice cut onions) and coerce calf's feet, lobsters and ducks into exquisite works of edible art.  The luscious chocolate cakes, whipped creams and raspberry mousse tantalizes like the food porn that it is--a sensual and lascivious reminder to what is truly important in life--you will leave the theater hungry.<br /><br />Along that line, the two couples, Paul (Stanley Tucci) and Julia and Eric (Chris Messina) and Julie either act as the aphrodisiacs for the food or allow the food to whisk them away in the general direction of the bedroom where dessert or in some cases appetizers segue into the joy of sex and more sex--no wonder Julia was always smiling.  Both male characters offer their women encouragement along the lines of the supporting architectural buttresses on the Cathedral of Notre Dame even when faced by what may seem a bit of an \\"I Love Lucy\\" type scheme. Regardless, both these ladies made their ideas work whether by design or serendipity and Ephron, wisely asserts that it is their good marriages that deserve the credit--even though the real life Powell has an affair which she chronicles in her not-yet-published memoir about learning the art of the butcher.<br /><br />Amy Adams' portrayal of Julie Powell seems a little seeped in too much sugar especially if one has read the Julie/Julia Project blog or the book that bears the same name as the film.  In her version, Ephron sanitizes the conservative-hating Powell, cleans up her apartment, washes out her rather profane mouth and thankfully eliminates the girlfriend dramas that take up a third of the memoir.  However, the slim-figured Adams' whose character claims to have gained weight after a year of rich French cuisine simply seems slim and still glows with that Giselle insouciance and naivet&eacute; she did so well in the Disney film \\"[[ASIN:B0011U52EC Enchanted (Widescreen Edition)]].\\"  Even so, Adams' innate cuteness and 20-something sense of searching works adequately as a foil for the larger than life Streep as the formidable Child.<br /><br />Bottom Line?  Nora Ephron's \\"Julie and Julia\\" chronicles the projects of two women from two very different generations with similar needs.  As a combination foodie/chick flick, it works very wellin its depiction of determination and the power of a slow and steady perseverance that ultimately leads to success.  However, \\"Julie and Julia\\" main thrust seems to be a tribute to good marriages where behind every great women stands an equally great and supportive male.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"a slow and steady perseverance that ultimately leads to success.

B000001FQI|4.0|I was surprised to learn that there were only 8 tracks on this compact disc. Usually compilations from audio cassetts and LP albums were about 10. Each song is long and has a message. I think the bands and groups of the 1980s always sang with a message. The British duo, Tears for Fears, with Roland Orzabel and Curt Smith maintain the seriousness of the world with their music. Sowing the Seeds of Love is my favorite in this collection but I do like Women in Chains with Oleta Adams as backup vocals. She has an incredible voice and the song has an important message about discrimination and abuse against women. I also liked the song, Advice for the Young at Heart, which I thought was more playful and light in comparison to the other songs.    When you listen to Tears for Fears, you are expected to hear about politics, international relations, disenfranschised populations, etc. without it being so obvious. They made and probably still make music for people to hear the messages and hopefully act upon them. Has the world changed since this album debuted in 1989? Probably not as much maybe we got worse or maybe we got better but groups like Tears for Fears and others made us think about the lyrics and the music and it's relation to the world.
B001T46T4W|5.0|I saw these guys open for The New York Dolls at Starland Ballroom.  It's been a while since I've seen a new act that excited me enough to buy their album.  From the opening funk-injected blues-rock chords of their opening song through their entire set, all I can say is that their a great new band and I wish them all the best.  This album stands up to their live performance.
B0019LY5I2|3.0|\\"G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra\\" provides big, loud, dumb, silly fun. It's a \\"bad\\" movie, but a \\"bad\\" movie that is entertaining. I would have given it a two-star overall, but the fun quotient it provides in a rather lackluster summer bumps it up to three.  It's like a live-action version of the cartoon, and it's good that the filmmaker doesn't take it too seriously.  At the same time, it's good that they do try to provide some bits of character development and exposition, although they try a little bit too hard, especially with some flashback scenes that fall short.  But, that's a small quibble, as the movie's a fun action-blast of a ride from beginning to end.  By contrast, Transformers Revenge of the Fallen was dumb -- and awful. G.I. Joe is dumb and silly, but for fans of the cartoon, it's more in line with that 80s show and the whole movie is delivered with tongue firmly in cheek.  But if someone sits down to analyze the acting, the character development and preposterous, yet interesting storyline, they're going to hate this movie.   This is a fun, entertaining piece of junk that entertains on pure adrenaline, goofy bits and lame one-liners.  Marlon Wayans is his typical annoying self, yet still fun at times, the female leads (Rachel Nichols and Sienna Miller) are good-looking as Scarlett and the Baroness, and Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow are ultra-cool.  One thing that did surprise me -- aside from it being a fun two hours -- was the violence. They really lived up to that PG-13 rating. Unlike the cartoon, where no one bites the bullet (or, er, the laser), there are some graphic death scenes and all sorts of violence, maiming and graphic fatal, close-up gun shots to the head and other body parts, even some impalings. That did lend the movie some gravitas. Just had to let you all know, and knowing's half the battle.  Yo Joe! :)

0061854549|4.0|Professor Dan Ariely, a behaviorial economist at Duke, wrote \\"Predictably Irrational,\\" a compilation of his ground-breaking psychology experiments into human behavior as a cogent counter to mainstream economics' standard model of individual behavior.  Most economists assume that individuals behave \\"rationally,\\" meaning that they accurately assess and evaluate risk and make decisions to maximize their economic self-interest.      This \\"rational\\" model of economic behavior that underpins economics and permits for economics' cold, sober mathematical approach is simply irrational, according to Professor Ariely.  First, people may be clear-headed most of the time, but it's very easy for them to lose all sound judgement when aroused or excited:  all men know the importance of wearing a condom, but how many do it in the heat of passion?  Second, his experiments have demonstrated that people do not evaluate and judge in absolute terms, but in relative terms.  That's why you should always go into a bar with a friend who's shorter, uglier, and fatter than you.  Also, consider the awesome marketing power of the word \\"free\\":  given a choice between a pair of socks discounted at 50% or a \\"buy two pair, get one free\\" deal most consumers would choose the latter, even though the discount is only 33%.  Then there's the power of pricing:  in his most insightful chapter \\"Why a 50 cent Advil really is more effective than a 1 cent Advil\\" Dr. Ariely explains experiments where by only raising the prices of performance-enhancing drugs he raised the students' performance.  And then there's the power of suggestions and anchoring:  by getting people to think in high numbers you can also get them to pay high prices for cheap quality goods.  Morever, expectations will influence outcome:  people will like something better if they went in thinking they would like it better.  Dr. Ariely research shows that people enjoy Coke not because it tastes better but because its powerful brand makes it feelbetter to drink:  Madison Avenue does deserve its paycheck.       None of Dr. Ariely's conclusions really fit into economics' understanding of the world, but then again wasn't mainstream economics partly responsible for the world's current financial meltdown?  The problem is that economics is a recent phenomenon with only a few centuries of history, but humans have been around millions of year and have been designed to survive in this world by interacting properly with others.  The rub is that free market capitalism is also a recent phenomenon, and to do well in this brave new world individuals really ought to be predictably rational instead of so emotional and instinctive.  In other words, economics is a normative discipline, offering guidelines on how to properly position yourself in a free market economy.          The really positive news is that Dr. Ariely confirms with his psychological experiments what spiritual and religious people have known for thousands of years:  the power of the mind is simply incredible and unquantifiable.  It's not changing the price of a drug that makes it more effective; it's how the change motivates and encourages the mind.  Thus, prayer, meditation, religious worship, church meetings, and the like are as effective as placebos:  which is to say they're very effective.  From an objective perspective, they may have no intrinsic economic or scientific value but their ability to transform people and their lives is priceless.  Perhaps the real problem with these activities is that they've been free for so many thousands of years, marketers, entrepreneurs, and economists can't price and extract value from them, and so ignore them.    While Dr. Ariely's book is sure to convince nearly all of his readers.  But I do have a suggestion on how Dr. Ariely can improve his research:  he needs to consider the idea of variation.  Traditional economists believe that the average individual is predictably rational, and Dr. Ariely believes the opposite.Both mistakenly adhere to the idea that an \\"average\\" individual exists.  What exists and is more pertinent to the study of economics is the group, and in any group you have variation in personality and behavior.  In any group, you are bound to have the predictably rational, the predictably irrational, the unpredictably rational, and the unpredictably irrational. In Dr. Ariely's experiments there was never a 100% majority:  a convincing majority was 75-80%.  You're always going to have a good minority of 10-20% who go their own separate way (as one Dr. Ariely's experiment shows, when beer drinkers will order beers they don't like just so that they can beers different from those of their drinking partners).        Variation is the ultimate rule of human behavior, and for economists to gain deeper insight into human behavior this ought to be next great area of focus and study.
B002A9OJ0Q|3.0|a-ha are back for their ninth studio album in 24 years, and I am not going to give a knee-jerk response. Five stars? I don't think so. Four is at least arguable, and I'm willing to entertain arguments for four stars, but \\"Foot Of The Mountain\\" is more three and a half stars.<br /><br />What?!! Why?!! Well, depending on your taste, you can blindly gush over this album, or like me, be more critical and take a closer look.<br /><br />The band cleverly revert to their standard 10 song album which they haven't done since 1993's \\"Memorial Beach\\". This insures no bloated excesses will appear on this album. It also sharpens the focus on weaker tracks like \\"Shadowside\\", \\"Nothing Keeping You Here\\", \\"Mother Nature Goes To Heaven\\" and \\"Sunny Mystery\\". This leaves the remaining six tracks to wow you with their catchy melodies and soaring vocals. Almost.<br /><br />This isn't \\"Hunting High And Low\\". That album had nary a wasted note or breath. Not so with \\"Foot Of The Mountain\\". \\"East Of The Sun, West Of The Moon\\" was a major artistic turn that really worked, also with nary a wasted note or breath. Not so with \\"Foot Of The Mountain\\". \\"Minor Earth Major Sky\\" was a strong return to form with a contemporary, updated sound with only a few duds. Not so with \\"Foot Of The Mountain\\".<br /><br />I'll argue that the first five tracks, \\"The Bandstand\\", \\"Riding The Crest\\", \\"What There Is\\", \\"Foot Of The Mountain\\" and \\"Real Meaning\\" are deceptive in that they flow very nicely together and Jedi mind trick you into thinking this is a fantastic album until you hit the very dull \\"Shadowside\\". Then you think, \\"aw, well, the band is entitled to one slip up\\". But no. \\"Nothing Keeping You Here\\" follows, and it's just not as good as the first five tracks. Then you begin to feel that sinking feeling you get when listening to the second half of any album--the feeling that the band has slacked off and front loaded their album. Then comes the absolute worst track on the disc, the god awful \\"Mother Nature Goes To Heaven\\". By this point you are wondering if there is going to be any redeeming song left on the album and you get the final mediocre blow with \\"Sunny Mystery\\". Then it happens. You are indeed redeemed with the final track \\"Start The Simulator\\". Still, with repeated listens you hope in vain to like the four weak songs on the back half of the album, but just can't find it in your heart to embrace them. They are just blah. I don't remember blah on \\"Hunting High And Low\\", \\"East Of The Sun West Of The Moon\\", and very few on \\"Minor Earth Major Sky\\".<br /><br />Did I want to give \\"Foot Of The Mountain\\" five stars? Yes. Did I hope before I listened to it that it would wow me and I'd really want to give it five stars? Yes. But the plain fact is, it is not good enough for five stars. I give it three and a half stars because it is above average a-ha music, but I am really still waiting for the band to make something classic. I read the other reviews here, and I agree with the one reviewer who noted that the band needs a really good producer who knows how to wring all the best qualities out of the band to give us die-hard fans that one last gem of an album.<br /><br />I will also stand in the line of fire by saying that I think Morten Harket's vocals were not up to his best standards here. I kept waiting for his soaring vocals to happen and they never did. If this is supposed to be a true return to form, where the heck are his great vocals?<br /><br />Here's my comparison chart for \\"Foot Of The Mountain\\" and a-ha's other albums:<br /><br />1985 Hunting High And Low: Five Stars<br />1986 Scoundrel Days: Five Stars<br />1988 Stay On These Roads: Five Stars<br />1990 East Of The Sun West Of The Moon: Five Stars<br />1993 Memorial Beach: Three Stars<br />2000 Minor Earth Major Sky: Four Stars<br />2002 Lifelines: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 Analogue: Three Stars<br />2009 Foot Of The Mountain: Three and a Half Starsu are wondering if there is going to be any redeeming song left on the album and you get the final mediocre blow with \\"Sunny Mystery\\".

B0019LY5I2|4.0|...But it is a fun ride, as a kid \\"G.I.Joe\\" was my favorite thing next to \\"Star Wars\\" & I at a mere 12 & 13 read the comics, they were quite story-oriented with an ongoing story arc, as was the 1983/1984 cartoon, the characters were colorful & each had their distinct personalities, as did the \\"Cobra\\" villians, but let's be real people, you can't do a on-going comic-book story in a two hour movie, however this film like most summer films is one big shoot-em up/explosion fest that has little character developement, which didn't bother me because I was already familiar with the characters to begin with below are the good & bad things about this one...    The Good>>>>    The action was awesome, definately an assault on the senses!!    The cast>>>    Ray Park(Darth Maul) as \\"Snake Eyes, they couldn't have picked a better person  Rachel Nichols(P2) as \\"Scarlett, man we have got to see more of her!!!!  Sienna Miller as \\"Baroness, always pictured Catherine Zeta Jones in this role, but Miller is a good alternate, & she is also one we need to see more of..  Channing Tatum as \\"Duke\\" was good, always pictured Rutger Hauer(Blade Runner)in this role, but sadly he is now showing his age, so Tatum is o.k. in this, even though I have no idea who he is    The actor playing \\"Heavy Duty\\" can't pronounce his name, but he was Mr. Ecko on the hit show \\"Lost\\", he is good here as well, he was also in director Stephen Sommers \\"Mummy Returns\\"    The one playing \\"Storm Shadow\\" was very true to the character  Marlon Wayans was also fun as the comic relief...  & Dennis Quaid was well... Dennis Quaid who looked nothing like \\"Hawk\\"    which brings me to...    The Bad>>>>    Cobra Commander was always a mystery, no one, not even Destro & Baroness knew who he was, here the viewer knows at the end, well.... so much for the suspense factor    Destro is reduced to a \\"Batman\\" villian who becomes Destro, never happened in the comics, but his involvement with Baroness was in the comics    Baroness' past involvement with Duke never happened in the comics, but that did not bother me, her repent at the end I can only hope is just a ploy to spring Destro & Cobra Commander at the begining of the next film... Sienna Miller said she signed a three-picture deal as did everyone else I am sure    Arnold Vosloo as Zartan was o.k., but him killing \\"Cover Girl\\"... WTF!!!!!!!!    Dennis Quaid got no action scenes... at all!!!    & \\"Storm Shadow's fate is unknown, surely they didn't kill him off    many other favorites(Flash, Major Bludd, Ace,.. not here>>> probably because they will be introduced in the next film....    & where was Agent Helix??? did I miss her, please help me on this, after seeing the action figure I was excited to see who would be playing her, but she was MIA!!!!    overall, this was a cool film if you didn't set your expectations high, did it go against the comics??  yes & no!    but let's face it, Hollywood sells what people want & that is a dumbing down to the masses, people can argue character developement all they want, but most do not want that, evidence of this can be seen in the constant trashing of the \\"Star Wars\\" Prequels\\" , just like with the new \\"Star Trek\\" everyone seems to like it, but had it been like the 60's show which relied on the strength of it's characters, everyone would have hated it, so the new film is one big action fest unlike the previous \\"Trek\\" films, so it should come as no surprise why \\"G.I.Joe\\" is this way as well, the comics were character driven, the film is not simply because the masses don't want character driven films, partly the reason this one didn't disappoint me, I knew that going in, & when you take these facts into account, than this one will be a fun ride!!!

B001L2EE9Y|5.0|I have heard so many great albums in my life time that to make a top ten list would be almost impossible but if I were to make one I would have to think this would be one of the first cd's to come to mind. Like Dylan's Blood on the Tracks it blends poetry with heartfelt emotion but Mitchell's poetry is always more intimate and personal than Dylan's and never more so than here. This is the kind of art where the artist invites one to visit the soul of the artist and by accepting that invitation you get a view of the human condition. From the playful \\"Carey\\" to the dark but still optimistic \\"Last time I saw Richard\\" you have everything right there. If you have never heard this cd I and the other 237 reviewers who gave this cd five stars envy you. I have played it so many times and it has been a part of my life for so long I can not remember a time when I had not heard it.  This is one of the all time great albums ever made and you should own it.
B00006EXDM|5.0|A truely brilliant album! An awesome addition to anyones music colection. A superb blend of old time blues and funk combined with sweet and haunting, symphonic melodies behind the gritty and powerful vocals of Mick Jagger. A blast from the past for some,  a novel encounter for others, but one thing is for sure, the timelessness of this album is sure to please everyone! This is classic rock and roll at it's finest! A true masterpiece!
0143038419|1.0|This book should be titled, \\"Me, Myself, and I.\\"  Talk about self-absorbed and trivial.  I realize that this book is about her spiritual journey (if you want to call it that), but she could have just stayed on her own bathroom floor and thought about herself from there.  Did she really need to visit the three \\"I\\"s?<br /><br />Also, I can only speak for Italy as I have never visited Bali nor India, but her skills as a travel journalist are sorely lacking.  No, the point of this book was not to provide a careful examination of each country, but what she did describe of Italy she easily could have gleaned from sharing a five minute conversation with someone who had visited there once upon a time.  At one point she admitted that she never visited a museum while she was there, but later she says that she paid homage to Michelangelo's David.  So which is it?  Last I checked the real David wasn't touring the streets of Florence.  Some aspects of her stories seem a bit suspect as though she is just trying to write a compelling book.  It left me wondering, what's the true story?<br /><br />A few notes about specifics in this book:  1.  Ketut--I seriously wonder whether he ever really did remember her.  I honestly think that he finally just gave in and said he did because he realized she how relentless she was.  2.  Slipping some money under the table to extend her visa in Indonesia--Really?  Apparently the laws don't apply to her and she is above everyone else.  3.  Her birthday party in Indonesia--She is quick to point out that a celebration of that magnitude is typically reserved for priests.  She should have just compared herself to a deity and gotten it over with.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I was astrongly encouraged to watch this movie, and having done so, am not sure if it was marriage counseling, a window into post-menopausal joy, a means of seeing into the hearts of the dedicated men and women of the intelligence community who choose to become \\"celibate chiefs\\" or \\"iron maidens\\" lamenting lost joys, or a mix of all three but I can testify as to its value in all three.<br /><br />Suffice to say that my 13 year old son nailed it when he heard I was going to watch it:  \\"Dad, you will love it or hate it.\\"  Well, I loved it, and judging by the reviews there are a lot of folks who hate it, so mark me down as a strong five.<br /><br />This movie grabbed me so tightly I spent half the time standing five feet in front of the screen, not content to watch from across the family room.  It brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion, and most especially as it reached the cresendo of discovery and shared emotions among the three dads (one of whom emerges as the last man standing), the young couple, and the star of the movie, a vampish Meryl Streep whose eye make-up alone made her a completely different person, a truly remarkable touch of art.<br /><br />The two \\"mature\\" female supporting actresses were spectacular, and the young actress featured is going to be seen again.  Tom Hanks was involved in this movie as an executive producer, and overall, I could not find a single disappointment in this movie.<br /><br />The cheoreography and imagination--for example, all the men in the cast dancing down the pier in flippers--is great, and over-all this movie hangs together very well.<br /><br />The singing was fine and not the centerpiece for for one who loves musicial, more than enough to check that box--the producers do avery fine job of balancing actual singing \\"live\\" and studio singing overlain for the longer pieces.

B001OQCV9M|5.0|I went to see the movie, Julie and Julia solely on the idea that any project Meryl Streep is involved in would automatically be good.  I couldn't imagine before going to see it how they would possibly work the storyline because it was based on two memoirs, one each by the two women involved.  Meryl Streep played Julia Child and Amy Adams played Julie Powell.  Because of her immense respect for Julia Child and her love of cooking Julie Powell decided to set aside 365 days to cook for her husband and herself and as it turned out several other people 524 of Julia Child's recipes.  It started out as a way of breaking the boredom of her day job, an escape from having to live in such a tiny apartment, and a means of teaching her self-discipline by sticking to a planned regimen on a day to day basis.  The result, however, turned out to be much more than that.    Julia Child had and Julie Powell has a very important knowledge about what makes good food great.  Great food is like great sex; both of them have to be more than just \\"ok\\" to bring a smile to your face that lasts for days every time you think about it.  And both women shared in common the idea that delicious French food should be available to the average American family even if you don't have servants that cook for you or an income that allows you to eat out at a fabulous French restaurant any time you like.  Both of them had wonderful husbands who supported and encouraged their dreams of rising above the drab existence of living vicariously on the accomplishments of their men.  The film captures beautifully the difficulty of that task for both Julie and Julia.  Both of them had forces fighting against their achieving their goals, but the love that was evident in each of their marriages overcame every one of them.    One of the posters for the film is a one-sided poster with a black background, two eggs (one brown and one white), and the question posed, \\"Passion. Ambition. Butter.  Do you have what it takes?\\"  When the movie is over, that question's answer is for both women a resounding \\"Yes, but as is always the case, neither of them did it alone\\".  The fact that they didn't do it alone though takes nothing away from the uniqueness of their accomplishments.

0375842209|5.0|For me, this book is a 5-star book for the following reasons: it really moved me and made me feel a myriad of emotions, it tought me important historic lessons, it made me contemplate the reality of my own life, it gave me courage to face my own challenges, and it has not been able to leave me. This book, in a good way, haunts me!<br /><br />The unique narrator (Death) makes the passages profound and philosophical and the result is a book that takes some time to read. The plot line and the interesting characters make you want to finish the book quickly but the reader should take the time to read it, especially in those moments when the narrator expresses some universal truths about our humanity. At times, I would read a line and gasp to myself \\"Death is saying this\\". It was a wonderful experience to read this.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|It's very scary to know about some of the results the government don't want you to know about genetically modified foods... mold in the blood caused by seedless grapes & watermelon.  There is a microscope that magnifies the blood 16,000x its size.  Of course the general health industry doesn't use it nor will the government allow them to have it because of what you may find in your blood stream caused by eating GMF.      There's been a couple of test done using McDonald's meat & french fries.  You know that food when left out will usually mold and rot.  Apparently somebody kept a McDonald's quarter pounder and french fries for over 3 years in a metal lunch box.  The results... the fries look the same as it did when it left the fryer and the hamburger didn't change at all.  The meat may have shrunk just a little and the bread became slightly brittle and crumbled when handled.  \\"What is McDonald feeding our children?\\" asked the producer of that film.  I can't prove if what she says is true or not, however I left some fries in my car for several months and the fries never molded.  It was still greasy and salty but not a speck of mold on it.  You can view this by going to [...] and search under McDonald.    I personally will not eat meat anymore after watching Food Inc.  I was slowly moving in this direction anyway, however after viewing Food Inc. it made the process much easier.  Should I ever fall off the wagon, I will only eat cattle fed on grains or classified as organic. I will only buy locally grown foods or grow my own and buy organic if at all possible.  I will pay extra to ensure I know what is going into my body.     If you believe our government has our best interest, think again.  They've poisoned our water, shove chemicals into our bodies by promoting drugs (treat the symptoms, not find the cure), force vaccines onto our children which I truly believe is the route to all our major illnesses today, allow chemicals into our food, knowing it's harmful effects,and made sure they will not be held responsible by passing laws in their favor. Big corporation, UGH!!!!!!    If you don't watch out for your children or yourself, who will?  Certainly not our government.
0205313426|5.0|This book should be the first addition to any writer's reference library. Yes, I believe it is that good and important.

In the world of computers and word processing software, you can do global searches for almost every rule and guideline contained in this book.

1594202249|4.0|The main focus of this review has to do with how Inherent Vice fits in with the rest of Pynchon's catalog (namely, that it doesn't). I could certainly think of little else while I read it--even though this feels like Pynchon, all the parts are in place, it's still just... not the same. I've always enjoyed Pynchon for a number of qualities that aren't to be found in any other author; these are, for the most part, absent. Despite brief burst of lyricism, the language was fairly base, and there was very little of Pynchon's accustomed intellectual voracity.     Still, Pynchon has never been funnier, nor have his characters been likable. The plotting is fairly convoluted at well. Inherent Vice seems to fill a hole within Pynchon's profile; it feels almost inevitable we experience him this way. As a unit within his works, it does its job decently well--and though it lacks substance (everything here is to be found in a more concentrated form within Vineland), it's defintely enjoyable. As long as he doesn't write something like this again.     If nothing else, Inherent Vice introduction to Pynchon's work; it ought to create a whole new audience for him. In a more sublime sense, it also represents Pynchon's ultimate tribute to the end of the sixties. An aura of nostalgia pervades the pages, and I can't help feeling that it, more than anything else, was driving force behind the composition of this newest text.     My edition ended at page 369. I'm sure I'm reading too much into it, but maybe that means something as well.
0684853523|5.0|I found this book educational, motivational, and one of the best references on the craft of writing that I have ever read. Stephen King provides very good advice. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who desires to be a writer. If you only could afford purchasing three reference books on the craft of writing, this should be one of them. If you only could afford purchasing two reference books, this should be one of them. And if you only could afford purchasing one reference book, then you'd be smart to first get The Elements of Style and then start saving up for this one.
0380820846|3.0|This is the fourth book of The Bridgerton Series    This is my 2nd favorite love story out of all the Bridgerton series. This is Colin's story, whom I believe is the third eldest son in the Bridgerton family. This story is a different kind of love story from Benedict's story. It's more like a slow love story for Colin and Penelope. It's Colin slow realization of his love for Penelope that makes this a great read.

068485743X|4.0|After too many conversations with too many authors who told too many dreadful stories of manuscript rejection upon rejection, it became apparent to me that those poor souls had: 1) not done their research, 2) had forgotten their research, or 3) thought they were too smart or too creative to pay heed to the research. To all that I must say, \\"Tsk, tsk.\\" The first critical lesson for any writer to learn is that the Rejection Pile is real. It is also much larger, by a factor exceeding ten thousand (maybe more), than the Acceptance Pile. Editors and agents are very, very busy people and they are easily annoyed by a vast number of things they find or don't find in a manuscript - things that quickly move the majority of manuscripts from the Inbox to the Rejection Pile. If you would like to improve the odds of your manuscript moving to the Acceptance Pile (more like to The Willing to Read More Pile), then read this book and heed its advice. It's as simple as that.  The lessons preached in this text are valuable. However, I found many of the examples too simple or obvious for my learning experience - it felt as if the author thought I was too stupid to understand more complex constructions. I would have appreciated more sophisticated examples of problems and corrections. But other than this one complaint, which is a big complaint, I think this text is worth the time and expense.
1572814748|5.0|I have a fairly small hand.  Wrapping my hand around the larger tarot decks for shuffling has always been difficult.  This deck is about an inch shorter than the regular Universal deck and a bit smaller than a regular playing card deck.  Its soo much easier for me to riffle shuffle.    The card stock isn't as sturdy as the full-sized tarot cards, and the colors are just slightly different but they're still the images I've come to know.  The card size isn't too small so you can still make out the details of the image so I can still easily focus my attention on the meanings.    The little box is nice.  Not a travel box but sturdier than expected.  All-in-all I'm pleased with this deck!

B0019LY5I2|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining this film was.  I liked it a lot more than any of the Transformer movies and the movie never seemed to get boring.  It begins with a Scottish arms dealer caught in 1600's France being forced to wear a steel mask (which is literally burnt into his head).  We then flash forward to what is labelled \\"the near distant future.\\" and the arm's dealer's later descendent is now a heavy dealer to the US military (and to other unsavory characters as well).      A contingent of soldiers is delivering a bunch of nanoweapons capable of eating anything in their patch (including steel, concrete, etc) when they are set upon by high tech and seemingly unstoppable enemies led by a mysterious woman with long black hair.  Two of the soldiers are able to escape and are later captured by the GI Joes which is a covert operation headed by Dennis Quaid.  The soldiers talk their way into joining the Joes, especially since one of the soldiers was engaged to the mysterious woman attacker and may know enough about her to capture her.    The movie continues with unbelievable technology close to Star Wars type with super soldier suits and incredible planes and underwater vehicles.  There is also a rivalry between the evil kung fu assassin with the bad guys and the Joe's own kung fu warrior.  Apparently the two were rivals from the time they were boys and each wants to kill the other.    If you can ignore the obvious logic flaws (how can all the technology be financed, how come the soldier in the super soldier suits can run as fast as cars and not get tired, etc.) and sit back and just watch you will be highly entertained throughout and the action is virtually non-stop.  This movie was way better than expected.  But is is still far inferior to the new Star Trek film.
B00005JGAB|5.0|There is really nothing more to say about this album. It is one of my all time favorites, through all of the subtle twists of my own personal musical tastes...the Ramones have been one of the constants. I have to admit to a great degree of satisfaction every time I see a youngster walking around sporting a Ramones shirt. It gives me some hope for the future.
B001EO748M|4.0|The second season of the Tudors series is entirely devoted to relationship between King Henry and his new wife Anne Boleyn.  Their secret marriage, her pregnancy with Elizabeth and subsequent miscarriage.  It order to establish legitimacy of his offspring with Anne, Henry creates a law that defines his succession with any (future) offspring he has with Anne.  He also takes out of the way everyone who may stand in his way politically.  That includes execution of Cardinal of England and beheading of his closest friend and mentor Thomas Moore.<br /><br />While these excutions and cruelties are necessary for him to preserve power, establish himself as a Head of Church of England, promote protestant faith and define line of the royal succession; it is almost impossible to understand the cruelties he imposes to his first wife Queen Catherine and their daughter Princess Mary.  Incidentally as time goes by and his desire for Anne cools off he starts to realize that he has paid a steep personal price in order to get his way in hopes of gaining a male heir for his kingdom.  As doubts creep in, he is more inclined to repress his pain by emersing himself in sexual escapades. Anne soon begins to realize that it will not be an easy task to keep King to herself and continue to get things accomplished her way.

B00006JKOM|5.0|I bought the album back in 1976, I bought the first CD in the 1990's and I bought this re-mastered CD. Like I said it's an overlooked classic Tull. Ranks with and most probably in my opinion better than most of JT's earlier classics. Every cut is top-notch and has classic Tull style. Don't think about it, buy it!  Crank up the volume. You'll love it.
B001PPGAK8|1.0|What a major disappointment this film turned out to be.  The first two films in the series directed by Brian Singer were not necessarily accurate, but still had weight to them.  This installment however brings nothing to the table but action scenes with no weight.  Major characters are killed off with little fanfare leaving the viewing audience with the most uninteresting mutants to fight the final battle.  Underdeveloped characters like Collossus, Roque, Angel, Kitty Pryde and Iceman step in to fight the final battle.  But they are so underdeveloped that we just don't care what happens.  The Phoenix storyline which should have been the focus, is reduced to a subplot.  Magneto, who was somewhat sympathetic in the first two films, is reduced to a cackling villain who doesn't care about the very mutants he is sacrificing for.  Note the line in the final battle where he states while mutants are falling in battle..and he says this smirking..\\"this is why the pawns go first\\".  This is so out of character from the first two films.  Xavier also has a line that he delivers to Wolverine, \\"I don't need to explain myself, least of all to you.\\"  Why would he say that to Logan?  Completely out of character.      The final battle is so absurd.  Magneto moves a bridge but can't bring a building down?  And his master plan is to throw flaming cars at the X-men?  That's it?  FLAMING CARS?  THE MUTANT WAR THAT WAS BUILDING UP CAME DOWN TO FLAMING CARS?  And Jean Grey does nothing for most of the movie but watch.  She kills Xavier and Cyclops without any remorse.  This movie just plain sucked.  For me personally the trilogy begins with X men Origins Wolverine.  I know many people did not like it, but I thought it was pretty good.  It wraps up with X2 as Logan's story comes full circle from Origins.  X3 for me is not part of cannon.  I wish Singer or someone else, anybody else would direct another X men film that ignores the events of X3.  Or just start over.  That's all.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|One of my rules of thumb is that after running across three unrelated references to a film, book or TV show in the same week, it's time to see what all the fuss is about. Recently, several \\"Donny Darko\\" references drove me to pick up the film. And am I glad they did!<br /><br />\\"Donny Darko\\" is dark, hypnotic and stimulating. A young man, living in an affluent home, is obviously mentally ill. For reasons that are not clear, he leaves his home at  night and wakes to find himself sleeping on backs roads and golf courses. His parents seem concerned, but attribute his odd, though harmless, behavior to his condition. But soon, Donny Darko is hearing voices, and seeing a frightening, adult-sized metal-faced rabbit called Frank who tells him that the world will end within the month.<br /><br />I'm not going to give up any more of the plot, except to say that it involves time travel, lost love and a chance at redemption.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal was born to play Donny. His dark features, sleepy expression and stiff movements perfectly capture the off-kilter inner world of his character. Mary McDonnell does knock-out work as Donny's mother, Rose. She has an incredible ability to portray two or more emotions simultaneously. The scene at the end of the film, in which she waves ambiguously and perhaps knowingly to another character, has had me thinking for days. Did she know? The real star of the movie, though is the music. Brooding, solemn and creepy, it gives the movie a thick, turgid and menacing aspect that perfectly complements the theme and acting.<br /><br />I got a kick from the movie's social commentary. Though Donny seems mad, the world he inhabits is similarly irrational, often making crazy Donny the sanest one in the room. The film is set in a conservative Catholic school in 1988, more for reasons of mood than anti-religious ones. The health teacher worships a local self-help guru and forces the class to watch his amateurish self-help videos. Donny's dad has an irrational hatred of then-presidential contender Michael Dukakis. Donny's friends brag unconvincingly about their exploits and fantasies. Donny's madness seems driven as much by a reaction to the inanity and insanity of his straight-laced, \\"normal\\" classmates as by his brain chemistry.<br /><br />Which makes it all the more ironic that he finds himself at the nexus of a cosmic tangle.<br /><br />I'm not sure any linear narrative would do justice to the crazy plot of this film. There must be a logical disconnect somewhere. But for a terrifically well-crafted film that comes at you from everywhere and everywhen, \\"Donny Darko\\" is hard to beat. It has become one of my favorite movies of all time.tial contender Michael Dukakis. Donny's friends brag unconvincingly about their exploits and fantasies.

B00003CXA2|5.0|This film reminds me a lot of one of my other all-time favourite movies \\"Being There\\" starring the comedic genius Peter Sellers but it is even more than that as it incorporates themes present in the outlandish myths of the tales of Paul Bunyon stretching the imagination with amusing whoppers all done so expertly interweaving important social and political issues spanning the 50's to the 80's coinciding with the growth of one simpleton Forrest Gump from childhood to adulthood.  The screenplay is excellent but what makes this film work so well is how well it handles the other major aspects of film-making such as sound effects, cinematography, lighting let alone the usual acting and directing that most people are familiar with.  If you look at this film from a purely technical aspect, this on all accounts is an excellent film and will certainly age very well over the years.  In fact I wouldn't be surprised to see this climb subtantially up any list of best films of all time as more and more people appreciate just how great this film is.<br /><br />Without being judgemental, this film manages to remind us of important historical events in a humourous manner also without being disrespectful of the subject matter.  There are many themes here but I liked the Lt Dan sub-story the best about how a person finds redemption and peace with himself and his faith.  The overall theme which addresses the question of whether life is a series of chance occurrences or the work of an invisible hand I found to be very interesting and is what will make this film as timeless as the answer to this central theme of this great movie.<br /><br />The second disc of extras which includes documentaries and interviews is very well done and the main disc has excellent picture (except for white spots in a few frames) and sound quality coming in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround options.<br /><br />Great film, great picture and sound quality and great extras make this a great addition to your movie library.<br /><br />Highly recommended!ed!
0545123267|1.0|It's obvious I'm a huge Twilight fan and I have reason for it. And I wanted to love this book and I was till the middle chapters and then things weren't getting anywhere and the characters other than the main two were just flat and boring. The werewolf background story was also boring and it just didn't intrigue me.   Yes Twilight wasn't the best written book but your looking at an author who's only experience was reading. For me the Twilight books are that good were the writing doesn't affect the story which is powerful and the reason why it has millions of followers. The passion and the way it makes you feel like your in another world but seems to make you feel like your still part of this world is BEAUTIFUL. So for me I resent the fact that people always compare Twilight to everything. It's beautiful piece of art that will be sticking around for a while like it or not. And that's ok if you don't like them your entitled to your opinion like I am.  And for this series I will probably read the next book to this series because I want to see if things get more interesting and that we another side to the other characters other than just talking but we'll see.
0385341008|4.0|What a lovely little book. Full of vivid characters and stories of the Island of Guernsey during World War 2. Juliet, an author, visits Guernsey just after World War 2 and beings to learn and write about the people of the Island and the experiences they had during the war.<br /><br />It's an intriguing look into the lives of people under occupations, detailing letters from normal people, and showing small acts of courage amongst diverse conditions. It tells of the power of the human character, the power we all have inside us that drives our will to survive. It shows how we put horrors aside as we try and lead a normal life.<br /><br />While the book is a little disjointed at times, it's full of real characters, is warm and funny. It really begins to give great insight into the people and their hard lives during the war.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|12 MONKEYS (along w/ BRAZIL) belongs in a hermitically-sealed time capsule so that future generations are assured of the experience of watching it. Bruce Willis (Die Hard, Pulp Fiction, The Fifth Element, Sin City, etc.) IS the time-traveling Cole! He lives the role, making it look easy. Madeleine Stowe is perfect as his suitably skeptical psychiatrist. Brad Pitt (SE7EN, KALIFORNIA) glides through his role as the utterly bonkers, Jeffrey. Terry Gilliam has a way of making ridiculous settings, themes, and surroundings seem absolutely logical in their insanity! The idea of a world-killing virus is bleak and terrifying, yet in Gilliam's hands, it is darkly humorous and exhilerating. His years w/ Python were well spent indeed! MONKEYS belongs on every sci-fi shelf...
B0019LY5I2|5.0|I mean come on people this is 2009 stop expecting the movie making of the early nineties those days are gone, coming into this movie I did not know what to expect but I have to say by far the action hit of the summer, and unlike revenge of the fallen it does not get boring for me, from the start to the end you are glued to your seat and cant believe some of the things that you are seeing in this movie the cast is great especially ray park as snake eyes and the three leading ladies would have been enough for me to go see it by itself, I don't want to give anything away so go see it and if you expect a fun movie with lots of mind blowing action trust me you won't be disapointed.
B00260HH3K|4.0|It's a good movie but could've been better they only used 35% of their budget for the movie so they had more they could've done if they would've made the movie about 3 hours long and the fight between the main enemy about 30 min long it would've definately been better and better received by everybody now that being said Justin Chatwin was a perfect selection for Goku I think and he's still a silly charecter at times I would name all the moments I think are silly but don't want to ruin the movie for people who havn't seen it yet and James Marsters was perfect for Piccolo and Chow Yun Fat was perfect for Master Roshi I even think that Emmy Rossum is a good choice for Bulma now the only charecter I didn't like was the guy who played Yamcha that is the only thing really wrong with the movie I think anyway one more thing I kinda like that they went with a more realistic approach because let's face it if they put everything that was in the manga and anime then it would've looked retarded you would have had Justin Chatwin in like a 2 foot tall wig and it just would not look good and it wouldn't have looked good to have a 30 foot tall ape on screen either and it's supposed to increase their power level 10x normal so being normal size fits better than thirty foot tall ape and they were really just using the source material as inspiration so when you look at it like that it is a very good movie the main reason this review is so long is I'm tired of everyone ripping on the movie because it's actually pretty good and for the people that do actually enjoy this movie there will be a sequel
B001KMB6YG|3.0|This movie has a lot going for it, including marquee actors (Vin Diesel, Michelle Yeoh, Charlotte Rampling, and Gerard Depardieux) and some well done action scenes.  Its the usual post-apocalypse setting, borrowing from many other films, particularly Blade Runner, Escape from New York, and Serenity.      Vin Diesel's character is hired to take a girl, who has been living in a convent for many years, to New York.  The girl does some weird things, like sensing when a bomb will go off, having an encyclopedic knowledge of all sorts of trivia, and having tremendous empathy for people around her getting hurt.  Turns she is some sort of experiment; a supercomputer designed to give birth to twins, i.e. two more supercomputers.  Unfortunately, none of this is explained in detail nor are any reasons given as to why we should care.  We are told that a church, headed by Charlotte Rampling, funded the experiment and wants to use her to recruit more followers.  Meanwhile, her father, who is a scientist who dreamed up the concept that was funded by the church, doesn't want the church to exploit her.    This film could have been so much better if there were compelling reasons for caring and these reasons were given early on.  As it is, just sit back and enjoy the action and try to ignore the very choppy plot.
B001JDSGPI|4.0|I read this when I was a teenager and its still one of my favorit books.

It is a long book as I recal over a thousand pages. so if you don't like fantisy or don't like reading don't buy it,  this book introdused me to the consept of a goddess religion. a consept that is old hat to me now and alot of people but was a revalation then. It has a very feminast message. I don't think there is one realy heroic or noble guy in the whole thing. but the womans corage in the face of adversaty inspired me. sometimes you need a long book to realy get in to the charictors.  insedently the images in my mind created by the book were much more vivid and evocative than the so called movies. but not every movie can have a harry potter bugit. O well.
B001KVZ6G6|1.0|This review is not for the movie itself but for the price of this Blu-ray. Over 41 dollars!? Are they insane? No movie should cost more than $20; and with so many DVD's these days being bargain priced at $10, this film is way overpriced. As if the company is ashamed to ask for so much $$$, they've even included a label that reads \\"a $74 dollar value\\"? Really? How is that possible when all I want is the movie? I could care less for the 3D glasses or the extra special features or the on-line bonus material or the digicopy disc. Does anybody really care about all that stuff? Doesn't 90% of the population just want the movie and maybe a decent documentary to go with it? Does Pixar really think so little of its fans that it thinks it can pull the wool over our heads like this?    I had planned on completing my Pixar collection on Blu-Ray since the transfers look fantastic but now I have to reconsider. We are currently in a recession and I don't have the extra money for this. Of course, this begs the question, why? Why does Pixar have to charge so much extra for their movies? Surely, a popular title like Up will be mass produced to sell a bazillion copies, therefore allowing for more economic pricing. Could it be that the greed that sank the Disney Corp. after \\"The Lion King\\" topped the box office has now affected Pixar? Has Pixar succumb to its own success? I prayed the day wouldn't come. I was a HUGE Disney fan, to the point of near religious devotion, before the company sold their heart and soul (Cinderella 2, anyone?) for a cheap buck. Please, John Lasseter, give us reasonable pricing and try to remember what made your company special in the first place---caring more about the art and less about the money. Does money have to corrupt everything? Don't make the same mistake as Disney.

B000005GWE|4.0|Two of today's top guitarists collaborate on this recording, ably backed by bassist Steve Swallow and drummer Bill Stewart. It is truly fascinating to listen to two master craftsmen at work, at times blending together, at other times standing distinctly apart. Perhaps because this was recorded for Scofield's label, it seems like more of a Scofield-style session than a Metheny session: perhaps the two of them can get together on Metheny's label and give us a recording with a different slant one of these days. At any rate, anybody who likes jazz guitar should simply love this CD, which simmers, cooks, and burns.

B0026IBY72|5.0|I did not have loads of expectations for this book. I did not think it would be a mind bending read. I thought that it would be well-written being by Shannon Hale and I thought it would be a fun summer read for a Jane Austen fan. I was right. I love this book!    I did not see it as boring, nor did I see the story play out in my head before I read the words, which often happens to me. I completely related to Jane trying to break her search for perfection cycle. She had me smiling and laughing out loud a few times which probably made me look like a loon in the gym. I know my boyfriend was laughing at me. Call me a sap, but after I read it the first time (within 48 hours), I read it all over again.     Normally I pass on the books I like to share with my friends. I could not bare to part with this one and told them to go buy their own, which they did. I am certain I will read this one a few more times because I enjoyed it so much.     If you like Jane Austen, and have the occasional thoughts of your own Mr. Darcy, you will enjoy this book as much as I did. Definitely pick this one to have some fun. It is an easy, quick read, even if you are an extreme multi-tasker dreaming of a simpler time (Mommy/Wife/Career/Life ;)     On a side note, I bought it new from the other options listed on Amazon with my Amazon Prime option. There was a small black mark on the bottom of the book.

B000002MIY|4.0|Donald Fagen, and Steely Dan, are our gift creature from the black lagoon. Just when you think comfortable retirement has commenced and you have gone in 1000s of other musical directions, there is a Dan sighting: a new album is imminenet. Out come Katie Lied, Aja, Nightfly.  Get those  sounds back in your head. Lagoon Steely is coming to town.<br /><br />If Nightfly is Fagen's ode to 50s jazz, film score and songbook that nourished his musical mussles, and Morph The Cat is a modern album with those influences in subtext, Kinderkimaid razor blades the hair.<br /><br />This came out in 1993, by which modern production had taken firm root. You don't get the warm retro-feel of Nightfly. Musically, Kinderkimaid is also more advaned: lots of unexpected chord subtitutions and six minute songs that steer into many parts: little jazz essays. Distant from Nightfly's tight retro-pop asthetic. Listen to the first track, or 'Tommorrow's Girls.\\" Listen a few times. It takes awhile, but get Fagen's drift, and you'll be lost joyfully in his winding musical caves.<br /><br />Look at the cover and contrast to Nightfly: Nightfly's cover conjurs images of dad's Nash, tube radios, Murry the K, an engeneer smoking Luckies on WABC all night long. Beat the reds to the moon, and anything's possible.<br /><br />Kinderkimaid makes you think George Jetson. Fagen's face on a car TV. All kinds of new-fangled gauges and gagets.  Inside, a new digital jazz you can dig crusing the stratosphere. A future we projected long ago.<br /><br />Thinking this way, you could see Nightfly, Kinderkirmad and Morph The Cat as a triology: past, future, and a post 9/11 present that is not the 2009 we imagined, all those years ago.<br /><br />Just a crazy theroy: either way, get all three. Listen to them--a lot.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|This film relates to two popular concepts: the \\"butterfly effect\\" and \\"when it rains it pours.\\" I feel this film is a slick attempt to manipulate these concepts. In Babel the butterflies are very big and it rains in the desert.    A rifle is fired carelessly in Morocco. A Japanese girl is devastated by her mother's death.  A nanny decides to take two children under her care across the border into Mexico without their parents' permission. These events all come together and have a traumatic impact on many different people. People suffer in this film.     Particularly slick and exploitive is the segment about the deaf teenager. Her story is only very tenuously connected to the others. The viewer must decide why it is included.    A lot of money was spent and a couple of star actors were hired. For what purpose? What do we learn? Who was entertained?  The actors followed their directions and the script...to nowhere.

B000H5TVJY|1.0|All the comments on the blu-ray transfer are correct. I rented this movie 2 years ago and was blown away by the pristine pq. Lionsgate really messed up bad with this which doesn't surprise me. This is not the first blu-ray transfer from lionsgate they destroyed. These people truly are clueless on pq. My advise to all that love this film is to try and find a used copy that was released by Universal Studios.
B00003CXB4|2.0|The end of the movie was defective, but my little grandchildren who were visiting wanted to take it home anyway, because except for the last five minutes the movie was fine and they loved it.  I also got a free movie which they loved and was in good condition.
B001993Y2C|4.0|A great series obviously.  I knew the show was going to be 5 stars plus.  Kind of \\"grainy\\" look, but I guess it was for an effect.  Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the disks have no resume play option!  At least I have not been able to figure out how to do it.  You would think with all the other features, it would have a resume play feature.  If you turn off the Blu Ray player (I have PS3), it will start from the beginning!  If anyone have been able to resume play, I would like to know how to do it.
0307269981|5.0|This is the second novel in the three novel series by the late Stieg Larsson (translated from the original Swedish).  To some extent, it builds on characters from the first novel, so the novels should be read in order.  We have elite computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, aka \\"Wasp\\" (the \\"girl\\" of the title), who is keeping a list of \\"people she should look into\\" - she can do bad things to people who have offended her, and takes a special interest in men who have abused women.  There is also a continuation of the second main character from the previous novel, investigative reporter Mikael Blumkvist.<br /><br />Lisbeth has her own ideas of justice.  She does not trust the police, and can become a dangerous loose cannon, so don't get in her way.  She is 4 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 90 pounds, so it is easy to underestimate her.  Don't treat her like a child (a very big mistake).  If you try to treat her rough, a Taser in the groin may be the least of your problems.<br /><br />There is an underlying story of an evil prostitution business using girls and younger women from Eastern Europe.  That is what involves Mikael.  But there is a lot more to the story as things evolve.  The ending, perhaps, does not completely wrap everything up, but there is the third novel in the series.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I have MANY excellent concert videos and this one is in the top five. Both performance and production value are as good as it gets. The Dolby Digital on the DVD is excellent and I absolutely can't wait to hear it in Dolby HD on blu ray!  [[ASIN:B002FE5XVK Stop Making Sense [Blu-ray]]]
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|A patriotic Marine sniper named Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is set up by his own government as a fall guy for a foiled(?) assasination attempt on the president.  Pre-Bush 43, a plot like this would have been considered far-fetched.  Thanx to Dubya & his corrupt administration, a plot such as this would nowadays be considered par-for-the-course inside the beltway!<br /><br />The only person in the world who is able to help Swagger is the bride of his dead spotter (played by Rhona Mitra).  After enlisting her help, he shows the bad guys (led, surprisingly, by an outside-the-norm role for Danny Glover) that it's best not to mess around with a Marine sniper!<br /><br />I know it's based on a book, but for me the film had a lot of motifs / overtones of [[ASIN:B000W07EKW The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)]].  Problem is, Mark Wahlberg is no where near as good an actor as Matt Damon.  He lacks Damon's powerful screen presence, and simply isn't up to the task of the character he is attempting to portray.<br /><br />The highlight of the cast would be Rhona Mitra as a simple country girl who lives in Kentucky.  She is absolutely positively perfect as the Bluegrass sweetheart!  She even speaks with a southern accent, which is something you don't hear in most Hollywood movies.  I was a bit surprised that she's the same woman who played the role in [[ASIN:B001HN697M Underworld: Rise of the Lycans]] as the roles are so different. This is a very dynamic actress!<br /><br />In summary, this is a film that was good, but could've been better with a superior actor in the lead role.  It does make you suspend your disbelief on some things from time-to-time, but that's all well & good in thrillers such as this one.
B00005N5S5|1.0|The movie is a great classic.<br /><br />The 1 star is for Amazon and the seller advertising deceitfully. Check out the 4 pics of the front covers. 2 do not have Special Edition on the cover and do not include the features of the SE. Instead it's just as a standard old DVD with the theatrical trailer only. These 2 should not have been included with the SE advertisement.<br /><br />When I read through the sellers profiles, only one stated that theirs was NOT the SE. Apparently they were the only honest seller in the list!
B001KYJA6K|3.0|I bought this CD on the basis of positive Amazon reviews and a positive review in a stereo magazine.  I should have known better; the magazine's staff of critics is proven, once again, to have tastes in recordings very different from mine.      I do appreciate the spirit of this disc; it's an interesting thematic concept, the music itself is engaging, and in many ways the sound-quality is excellent.  The problem, however, is the singing, which is quite annoying--largely a function of how the voices were recorded (or how the CD was mastered).  The singers all have excellent voices, but the recorded sound gives them a glare and edginess that is irritating.  (Also, there is some singing here by a countertenor--very ably done--but not my favorite listening pleasure.)  The instrumentals, while beautiful, are more glassy-sounding than irritating.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|This an an all time great movie!  Really glad to finally own it!   Arrived when promised and in new condition.
B00005B36H|5.0|Opinions are like... ah if you don't know I'm not repeating it.  There seems to be a great opinion as to which Tool album is \\"the best.\\"  Some people liked [[ASIN:B000000993 Undertow]] because it was direct and to the point.  Some people liked [[ASIN:B00000099Y Aenima]] because it was heavy and aggressive.  Some people may even like [[ASIN:B000EULJLU 10,000 Days]] because of the fact that it was inspired my the recent wave of avant-garde metal that's coming out a la Meshuggah or Fantomas...    My personal choice, however, is Lateralus.  The album was their most progressive and the most personal.  With the exception of Ticks and Leeches (which to me, was a song written to appease the people who wanted Tool to be \\"heavy like Aenima\\") the rest of the album treads the line of a spiritual (or maybe even hallucinogenic) experience that is best described as euphoric and invigorating.  There's rarely a song that's in common time, the music is constantly pushing boundaries, and as far as singing goes, this is probably MJK's most cathartic effort (well, except for the Wings for Marie songs on 10,000 Days.)  I don't find a dull moment in this album and have continued to enjoy listening to it for the past eight years.    I recommend this album to all.
B0007XTOKC|5.0|This is without doubt one of the best Elvis recordings ever put to tape. The sound quality of the RCA Living Stereo production is as normal first rate. It a reach out and touch feel when listening to the recordings.<br /><br />The CD mastering is superb to boot. This CD really shows the range Elvis had, almost hitting a high C on Surrender, keep in mind Elvis was not classical trained which makes this feat even more amazing.<br /><br />If you enjoy Rock, Pop, and Blues this is necessary have for your collection. Add to this His Hand in Mine and you have the core of Elvis.<br /><br />Not until he would go back to record From Elvis in Memphis would his focus and determination be has strong to prove just how good he was.<br /><br />On that note, please purchase the new 2-CD set of Elvis in Memphis it is just superb and the mastering is first rate.<br /><br />It sad that Elvis could not have had the freedom to really grow as an artist, his voice did, but locked into the movies and the RCA machine of providing poor material really put a damper on what Elvis could of done say he was with Atlantic Records, now that would have been something to behold.<br /><br />Buy the above cd's no matter if your 21 or 61, if you love music you enjoy these cd's.

B002EDH0FE|2.0|I watched this through a Tivo HD to a 1080p Sharp (2-Ch audio).  The video quality was terrific!!!  However, it seems that there is an issue with the audio down-mix for Tivo devices.  The audio remastry effort should be done to THX standards, so you can hear the dialog!!!!  Even more frustrating, there were no subtitles with this movie, so I was forced to turn up the volume to hear the dialog, but when explosions happened - I had to rush to turn down the volume again.  It's REALLY terrible if you have to mess with the volume during the entire movie, it takes you out of the \\"illusion\\" of the movie and makes you focus on the playback hardware in a bad way.  Tivo if you're reading this, put some foot-to-*** with the content provider, since this affects your customers!!    Lack of subtitles meant I had no backup for getting dialog, had to suffer through it instead.  Good movie though, I'll be buying it on Blu-Ray where it's done right.
B0002ADY24|4.0|With the departure of vocalist David Byron - and to a much lesser extent, bassist John Wetton - it would have been easy to write the band off before this February 1977 release. But once the album hit the record stores, it was clear that Uriah Heep was far from cashing in the chips and becoming an early version of a \\"classic rock\\" band.<br /><br />The eight original tracks, there is a bevy of bonus material, clocks in at 35:20 and features a solid vocal statement by John Lawton - The Hanging Tree - and a pair of cuts, Wise Man and Sympathy, that became immediate fan favorites. The title track features some neat work by guitarist Mick Box and keyboardist Ken Hensley, with the sleeper being drummer Lee Kerslake's Who Needs Me, which chronicles his frustration of being an ignored songwriter within the band. Bassist Trevor Bolder is solid in his studio debut.<br /><br />On this occasion, the group reached the crossroads and decided to rip up the map and forge its own road home. The renewed energy clearly demonstrated that there was life after Byron.
B0002KQNL8|1.0|I went to see this movie in 1988 with a lot of expectations but i found out that this is not even a sequel, they just bought the title rights and made this waste of a film, it was really sad to see the name of a great zombie movie wasted in this trash, for real zombie fans this is nonexistent, that is the reason why the actors of the original never talk about any so called sequels in the documentaries because there aren't any. In reality there are no sequels from ROTLD, is a very unique film, sadly a real ROTLD 2 never came but maybe a remake will come in the near future.
1439102813|3.0|I agree that this is a compelling story of what the descent into Alzheimers must be like.  The reason I don't rate it higher is that I didn't particularly like Alice, her husband or kids.  They are pretty stock characters, super-achievers (except for the wayward \\"arty\\" kid, who, of course, becomes responsible when mom gets sick), and I found them, to be blunt, annoying.  The writing is fine, though not overly memorable.  A good book, to be sure, but with flaws.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I was amazed at the brilliance all over again... electric, masterful, captivating... I still don't get the crotch grabbing, but I accept it as part of the act!

B000AOEMXM|1.0|We bought this item from thegoodmart via your website.  The product came quickly but the packaging was nothing like your illustration.  Instead the 27 discs were in a folder of thin plastic slip covers.  We got as far as disc 6 before giving up as three of the discs were faulty with many video and audio dropouts.  We did not bother to play further.  We have tried to contact thegoodmart in order to send the discs back or get a refund but to no avail.  I suspect that we have been fobbed off with seconds or rejected discs.  We appear to be stuck with $143 of junk.  We would strongly urge your customers not to buy from thegoodmart and we will certainly not do so again.  We do want to add this series to our collection but how do we ensure that we are getting the \\"real\\" thing and not some faulty knockoff?<br /><br />Isobel Berry
B002DKGWSE|1.0|Let me just start by saying i can't believe hollywood can churn out such garbage and get away with it, it really shows how desensitized we all have become in this country. I'm sure this will be banned in many other countries because they don't want this trash to fill there homes and give people ideas. When i started watching this i figured it was just another killers come into town, find the people in the house, everyone hides, some get killed nothing major. Well come to find out its nothing but, 2 young teenage girls, being brutally raped face down in the dirt, stabbed in the stomach and chest after already being beaten, and all this is very very graphically shown in the unrated version. Well after these scenes and me feeling like i wanted to projectile vomit everywhere i shut it off. I sat and thought to myself my god, imagine a movie like this even ten years ago, it was unthinkable. So if yours some sick twist #^#&!@ then this movie will appeal to you, but ask yourself this, would u like to know your daughter was brutally raped, while other people watched, and then shot when she tried to escape. Or any other family member for that matter. This is just tasteless garbage, and trust me i've seen a LOT of brutal movies. Remember Wolf Creek, that movie was The Sound Of Music compared to this, didnt even come close.
B0019LY5I2|5.0|I went and seen G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra and I thought it was a great movie. As a kid I did not see the cartoon because that was my brothers thing and not mine BUT the movie was AWESOME!! If you are looking for a movie with a lot of action and high speed chases and crashes then this movie is for you. This movie had a great storyline and I loved how the characters came together and how they gave a back story of how some of the characters knew each other. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of G.I. Joe or to anyone who likes a good action movie full of non stop thrills and chases.
B001UE27X8|5.0|There's not much I can add to what already has been said of Tony Bennett. He's possibly the most beloved and deservedly appreciated vocal talent of the last half a century. Bill Evans also was a giant of the jazz world, though perhaps not as well-known by mainstream music fans. But I can wholeheartedly recommend this collection to both newcomers looking to wade into the waters of jazz, and deeply knowledgeable fans simply looking for more great recordings they haven't yet explored. The Complete Tony Bennett / Bill Evans Recordings is just Bennett and Evans, richly performing their crafts. Deftly, the two move in and out of these tunes, tastefully hitting just the right notes. This collection would be a fine addition to ANYONE'S music library.
1433502410|3.0|I purchased this bible at cb stores and liked all the content. There is introduction to much information about other religions like JW + others. I do not know why Amazon does not carry the True tone mine was easily available. However recently I noticed that there has been a great discussion the revenants on all bibles like NASB, NIV etc... and that the only bible to read is the King JAMES. At the beginning of my studies I found the KJ version to be a difficult read but have been told that ALL others leave out to much information. Not sure if this is true or not. I currently use the Life application edition as well. My only complaint is the small lettering so break out your glasses.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|I loved the book _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ when I was a child, and so I was intrigued when I heard that the Tim Burton movie was a more faithful retelling of the book than the 1970's Gene Wilder vehicle \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\\" Now that I've watched the DVD with my young son (also a fan of the book), I'd say that it is a *different* reimagining of the story than the 1970s version, though neither director was content to reproduce the simple morality play of the book.    The best thing about Timothy Burton's version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the factory itself, beautifully visually imagined, sometimes in ways that have nothing to do with the book but don't contradict it, either. The opening titles are accompanied by dazzling visuals of Rube Goldberg-like machines packaging bars of chocolate and parachuting them out of the factory. My son was completely enchanted, and I also enjoyed the ballet-like movements of the imaginary machines. All in all, the movie continued to dazzle the eye, giving the chocolate factory a magical appeal well in keeping with the fascination it holds for the characters in the book.    The acting is also top-notch, especially by the children. Nice Charlie is sympathetic but not cloying, and all the other children are convincingly unpleasant, as they're supposed to be. The grandparents are also fabulous, and manage to each project a distinctive character, even though 3 of them have very small roles. The characters of Mike Teavee and Violet Beauregard were creatively updated in a way that made them convincing contemporary characters in the era of the movie.     On the other hand, I felt disappointed by a slight under-playing of the naughty children, especially Veruca Salt, who doesn't have a proper tantrum. I don't mean that the young actress underplayed, but the script undercut this aspect of the story, making the naughty children's punishments seem less justified than they did in the book.    This takes meto my main criticism: Tim Burton's clear discomfort with the book's simple bad kids/good kid morality play. While he dared to make Charlie as good as he is in the book (which I appreciated), he felt compelled to psychologize Willy Wonka into a damaged eternal child forever replaying his dysfunctional relationship with his own father. This led to a lot of flashbacks of young Willy with his stern father which I found overdone, clicheed, and dull. There's also a dull section at the end that has nothing to do with the book and everything to do with this compulsively added bit of amateur psychoanalysis. It's not that I can't appreciate psychological depth in a story, but it didn't belong in *this* story, it slows things down, and it's done in a way that practically makes the psychoanalytic parody \\"High Anxiety\\" look subtle by comparison. While I didn't like all the ways the earlier \\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\\" movie changed the plot of the book, I think Gene Wilder, with his air of detached amusement, was more like the Willy Wonka of the book than Depp's neurotic Michael Jackson caricature.
B000P0J0AQ|4.0|Way back in 1999, The Matrix was a surprise hit, and while this movie is ten years old, The Matrix still surprised me.  I wonder if that's what people thought when they first saw this science fiction movie, the science fiction movie that was supposed to be passed under the much hyped Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. My mind, until recently, was probably the same figure.  The Matrix never really seemed like much of a movie that would be of interest to me, even though it's in a movie genre I have interest in.  Lest to say, it's 1999 again.<br /><br />Legimate criticism are there, of course, but those criticisms are easily transcends by good pace,  great action, and an intriguing premise that can easily become more pretentious if your not careful.  Keanu Reeves is an extremely wooden actor in this movie (somewhat in Bill and Ted, though some of his fierceness is pretty undeniable. It also helps to ignore whoever says The Matrix is deemed to be significant in the department of social commentary, high philosphy, and other pipe dream of that nature.  Maybe it's the moviegoers fault more than the movie itself.  Whatever it is, it's still science fiction to me, with a very cool premise that of course, in real life, would probalby never happen.  I think it's pretty safe to say our world is the ideal world to use us.  I do, however, think it's funny that the movie's premise of how something (the Matrix itself in this movie) is what you make it, is an exact representation of how the viewer will probably intepret it, whether it being a farce, pretentious, or a \\"powerful source of philosphy\\".  Whoa.<br /><br />Yeah, despite the fact that it's still an action science fiction film at heart, it's premise is more than just the mindless action akin of it's inspiration, including John Woo's Hardboiled.  If you don't let the Matrix become too pretentious in your eyes, you'll have a blast, and will enjoy this movie greatly.  It's parallel world itself is interesting, a \\"what if\\" kind of question (well, okay, some unpretentious, interesting philosphy is on display in this movie) It's true that the Matrix can be pretentious if you try to tout it as some kind of deep meaning akin to religion, but I think I've made my point across that.  I hear from many people that the Matrix really can't be explained until you've seen the movie, so let's just go with that.<br /><br />However, what I can vouch for is the Matrix's action.  Probably the best thing about the Matrix is the action and art direction.  The Matrix's dystopian future is portrayed with a cyber techno thriller, and the Matrix is fully visioned.  However, the action, and it's patened \\"bullet time\\", is of course, one of the biggest stars here.  The use of slow motion to emphasize bullets, explosions (that building explosion in the last half of the movie is amazing), and certain punches are emp.  And it doesn't induldge into any way so it feels like an empty -G@$m.  Energetic as well, something some of those Asian movies (which is one thing that makes Kill Bill better than it's predecessors.  F*** Lady Snowblood) kind of dull to watch.  The Matrix's \\"techno-slamming visuals\\" also thrive in this world, it's use of green, cyber text ( The Matrix Digital Rain) at the beggining is an example of the many cyber, still cool special effects.  The sound itself is equally crafted well, with those irrerestible sound effects for every action.  Also, cool use of Mindfields by Prodigy in the club, nice little touch that only a music geek would care about.<br /><br />Indeed, this movie was still a surprise, and I definitely am glad I own it.  As a result, I definitely will see it more than once, and will make sure to continue the story by watching the sequals.<br /><br />Bkay, some unpretentious, interesting philosphy is on display in this movie) It's true that the Matrix can be pretentious if you try to tout it as some kind of deep meaning akin to religion, but I think I've made my point across that.

B000JIHP88|5.0|My sister-in-law bought me this mobile. It's very easy to put together. My newborn baby didn't seem interested in the mobile at first. But when she reached 2 months, she started to be mesmerized by the moving bright toys (especially the parrot and monkey). When she wakes up crying for her feeding, I would turn it on, and she would be distracted by the mobile, giving me time to prepare her bottle.    This mobile is probably the best one in the market. My baby loves it so much, she can spend 15 - 20 minutes (now close to 3 months) just looking at the mobile, listening to the music, and cooing to the stuffed animals.

1416955070|5.0|At first, it may seem like this book is going to be your basic run of the mill- VAMPIRE LOVE STORY. It is anything but that. The first chapter draws you into Clary's seemingly normal life full of crushes, parties and the mother-daughter arguments that allows you to relate to her story.    It's definitely not your typical vampire love story because well... they aren't vampires. In fact, they kill vampires daily and hunt demonic beings and long lost relatives, and those werewolves you can't get enough of, but amongst all of the drama and thrill lies a real girl and her friends, and you get to see the journey she takes and the realizations and mistakes that she partakes in along the way.   A must-read for Twilight lovers and non-Twilight lovers!!

B00000AOUD|5.0|Thick As A Brick - (1972) 4 Tracks (2 bonus) (55:40)  *****<br /><br />This was very adventurous indeed...<br /><br />I can now say that Jethro Tull's \\"Thick as a Brick\\" is a definite Prog Masterpiece.  But, I will admit that this revelation only came recently.  I was just a casual fan of Ian Anderson's music while growing up, having only \\"M.U. - the Best of Jethro Tull\\" on vinyl.  I did like the music on that album very much, and later bought \\"Aqualung\\" on compact disc.  Those were the only two albums I had by Tull for many years until I began exploring progressive rock further in just the past five years.  Thick as a Brick (TaaB) kept showing up on many music fans top progressive rock picks that I was researching on the web.<br /><br />Since almost everyone, it seemed, was recommending this album as such an outstanding example of 70's era \\"progressive rock\\", I decided to go ahead and give it try and bought one of the newly remastered versions and listened to it a few times.  Now, I had heard parts of TaaB. There is a short \\"edit\\" of TaaB on the M.U. Best of album.  On first listen I realized this wasn't the most accessible album I had ever listened to, and wasn't that impressed at first.  There is a lot of music being played on this thing, and it can be a little over-whelming at times.  But, after a few more listens, I began to really appreciate it for the music it contained.  I already knew its status as a ground-breaking piece of work, with a song that basically plays non-stop across two sides of an album.  Most people would imagine this as an unattainable feat.  Surely this thing must begin to repeat itself and become boring.  Surprisingly, No; In fact, this piece of music is so long and so complex, that it seems like with each listen you will hear something new or at least pay more attention one part or another as your mind tries to \\"soak it all in\\".  Eventually, Thick as a Brick begins to reward the listener with each successive spin of the album.  It is very interesting music and I recommend it as an integral piece of the Jethro Tull catalog.<br /><br />The remastered version of TAAB has a bonus Live track of TAAB recorded at Madison Square Gardens in 1978 running approximately 12 minutes and an interview with Ian Anderson, Martin Barre, and Jeffrey Hammond which is over 16 minutes long regarding the writing and recording of the album.I recommend it as an integral piece of the Jethro Tull catalog.

B001TODCII|5.0|Whew! That's entertainment! \\"Taken\\" has to be the most intense, exciting Liam Neeson movie to date! Like Tchaikovsky's music for Swan Lake, this film begins very quietly and continues to smoothly, evenly ramp up a cresendo to absolute ferosity. The energy and suspense of the ending might even leave you breathless. Opening on a child's birthday party, this film opens slowly, delibertly building back story. You get to know Bryan (Neeson), his history as a spy, how he has been affected by the disolusion of his marriage and his estrangement from his daughter. You meet some of the people with whom he used to work and the frienships he's maintained. When his daughter wants to go to a trip to Paris with a friend you understand his reaction - and why he gives in. Everything is nailed down in the first act. No loose ends are left for later. The avantage of this unusual but obviously deliberate approach is that, as the cresendo continues and the action begins, there is nothing in the way. It's a straight line from what's this about to Whoa! I can breathe again. This would be a great action thriller by any measure. But, with Neesom at the top of his craft, he pushes this film into a realm of something else. I hope my thoughts are helpful! B+
B000002U82|5.0|It is always difficult to say what the best album ever made was, and of course people will all have different opinions and crtitics will have different lists.  And despite all the caveats, this has to be on anyone's list, even those who may not be fans of so-called \\"progressive\\" music.    Though it has been said before, listening to Dark Side of The Moon on a very good set of headphones is a very worthwhile way of listening to the record.  The nuances and of the musicianship, arrangement and production can really be heard.    Atmoshpere builds and changes happen throughout as each shift in the field of listening adds to the songs.  From the opening of Speak To Me where the themes of what is to come, to the hypnotic synthesizer of On The Run, to Time and throughout the rest of the record each song weaves into the next and changes into something else.    Though critics may say it is old or would only appeal to older listeners, I am not a baby boomer nor am I a progressive rock fan.  It is not that I dislike progressive rock, it is not that I would call myself a fan.  But Pink Floyd in the records are a different standard of music, and this record is one of their masterpieces.      Some of their other records, particularly The Wall, may be more accessible to people to start with due to the more \\"pop\\" aspects of that record - meaning that the songs such as \\"Hey You\\", \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" could be easier to hear the first time and catch onto them, but their is a reason why many consider this their best work, in addition to be one of the best records.    Tremendous sales and popularity of a record are not always an indicator of whether a record is good, more so today when bands come and go in a flash based on popularity or publicity.  Dark Side of The Moon is one of those records where sales are actually a good indicator of how good the music is.

All about the $$$$$$ cause it sure as hell aint about the story! I really enjoy deadpool as a character too bad he isn't in this movie but they keep calling this other guy his name hmmm weird. Really honestly people avoid this train wreck its poorly done not very entertaining and really a slap in the face of the 1st 2 xmen movies ( we wont mention a certain part of this Trilogy) Save Ur money for Star trek or if u haven't bought it pick up the far far superior Watchmen don't let fox shovel us this pig swill, or wolverine swill if u will.
B001AEF6BI|4.0|I own the \\"High School Reunion\\" edition of the DVD.  If they remaster it, and pick up what was either left on the cutting room floor, or left out of the final production, it could make a substantial turn in how we view the movie.  Watch the ORIGINAL trailer on the DVD.  It shows you something left out of the final production.  Something that implied there was an additional segment or subplot to be in the movie that they left on the floor in editing.    Overall it is an era movie.  Something a lot of us remember dealing with growing up, peer pressure and \\"conformity\\" in youth.  Trying to find ones place in the crowd.  A movie like, many others, will most likely be remade with newer songs so it isn't as dated when aired years down the road.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|OUTLANDER offers something for everyone. And everyone else too. Historical context, furious action, horror, suspense, science fiction, boy-girl love, boy-boy camaraderie, generous shots of CGI (well-done, too), pretty reasonable rational writing (like characters and action make sense), acting good enough for the writing, gritty, well-done wardrobe and set design, an overall concept made of many (good) movies you've seen, and maybe some you will be seeing. Overall you'd   think it was cacophony; but, it works.     Well enough for a good time. Somehow, I wouldn't let myself go looking for nits to pick; I liked the film and the producers  mix of performers, scoring with enough logic to carry you through to credits. It's not a thoughtful film; there are no character insights or ideas to mull over. It's simply a good movie; simple in a good way. Enjoy.    Oh, and the action never stops. It keep building too. As does the mayhem and gore.    Oh, I recognized Jim Caviezel, the Outlander character. He's been a supporting actor for awhile. Hope he now can get more leads. I terms of action-hero stuff and good character portrayal, he's ready and then some. Ron Perlman and John Hurt's parts aren't  written for them to shine; but their presence does lend an air of a more of a big-studio film than Outlander is.
0374139563|5.0|First off, can someone explain to me why this woman is trying to discredit Bono and Bob Geldoff? What make this woman think she knows more than two great musicians, just because she has a PhD in Economics?     Take it easy, I'm just kidding.    With all the fanfare that Angelina Jolie and Bono are getting, with their big tours of the \\"third world\\", I began to wonder where the \\"locals\\" fit in. While all the celebrities are droning on about poverty in Africa, what do the Africans have to say? Africa has universities, so what do African academics think of foreign aid? Why aren't they the ones speaking on TV?    Dambisa Moyo is from Zambia, has a PhD in Economics, and worked in finance, so she writes with a bit more authority than Bono. She argues that \\"foreign aid\\" in the form of World Bank and IMF loans are hurting Africa. The money ends up in the hands of corrupt dictators, who misspend the money while the people starve. Look at Idi Amin, and Mbutu Sese Seku; they lived in high luxury while their nations lacked schools, hospitals, and paved roads. If you want more proof, look at Jean Bedel Bokassa of the Central African Republic; when the money ran out, he literally \\"ate\\" his countrymen (pun intended). It's not only Africa that suffers from World Bank loans. In the documentary \\"Life and Debt\\", Michael Manley talks about how World Bank loans damaged Jamaica too.    The success stories discussed in the book come from foreign investment, not loans. The investment, however, isn't in  Africa's gold and diamond mines, which offer low pay and low skill. The best investment is in industry and technology. Computer chip factories generally pay more, and require more skill (in which the workers can be trained). Ghana, for instance, now has data-entry businesses that pay an hourly wage. The wage is far less than the US minimum, but a lot more than you'd earn in a diamond mine!  Yet in this age, 40 years into Africa's independence, the continent is barely industrialized.     Lookat the \\"diamond\\" issue in terms of labor; the miners get paid a pittance, but the diamond-cutters get paid thousands! Yet none of the diamond-cutters are in Africa; they're in New York, Tel Aviv, and Antwerp! Africa's diamond mines are of no real benefit to the continent because the only job they offer is unskilled labor.    Moyo considers China a friend of Africa. Thanks to Chinese investment, there are paved roads, factories, and businesses that give jobs and skill. But she faults the leaders in Africa as being a blockage to foreign investment. According to her, it takes months to get a business license in Cameroon, while in South Korea it takes a week. Who wants to invest in Africa when the governments make things too damn hard?    One thing Moyo doesn't dwell on is birth control. A woman who has children to take care of is held back. Putting off children can help women economically. Birth control is very popular in India, China, Taiwan, and Japan, and look at how well those countries are doing. When you put off marriage and children until you're 26, you have more time to work, go to school, and develop a career.    Those of us that read The Economist will know that \\"natural resources\\", particularly \\"mineral wealth\\", can be a ticket to poverty. Technology is what brought India out of poverty in the last decade and it can do the same for Africa. Remember how \\"King Cotton\\" dominated the American South and ruined it at the same time? That's what natural resources did to Africa; it attracted dangerous loans that put Africa in debt.    Maybe it's time we started listening to people like Moyo (who has a PhD), and not to people like Bono (who never finished school).
B0024FAR5M|5.0|The Shield may be lamentably gone from TV, but prominent alumnus Kurt Sutter seems to have taken it upon himself to carry on its legacy with Sons of Anarchy, and if the show's first season is any indication he's more than up to the task.  Anyone who enjoyed The Shield's combination of intelligence and testosterone will certainly find a lot to like here, as SoA quickly established itself as among TV's most unique and consistently compelling shows and only got better from there.  Striking a near-perfect balance between grit and sensationalism, it takes viewers through a world marked by violence, double-dealing, and racial division, with an emphasis on the ambiguous morality and personal and familial baggage that come with a life lived between the straight world and the criminal one.  The machinations of the characters and the twists of the plot are almost operatic, but the show remains rooted in the harsh realities of gangland.<br /><br />The premise is sort of Hamlet-meets-the-Sopranos: youthful biker and new dad Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam) finds himself trying to balance work with personal life as the Vice President of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcylcle Club Redwood Original (aka SAMCRO), a gun-running biker gang co-founded by his late father and now run by his stepfather Clay Morrow (the ever-swaggering Ron Perlman), who's married to Clay's widowed mother Gemma (Katey Sagal, in pretty much the biggest departure possible from her Married With Children days).  From the somewhat hippie-ish beginnings envisioned by Jax's father, SAMCRO has evolved into a criminal powerhouse, especially in their central California base of Charming, where they're practically a small-town Mafia.  These guys may not be as bad as the Hell's Angels, but the show makes it clear that they're far from harmless nonconformists, as we see them running guns, committing murders and (in one particularly stunning scene) burning off the tattoo of a perfidious former member.  Single-episode plots focusing on the gang's efforts to turn a profit and stay out of trouble are expertly mixed with longer arcs dealing with the constant conflicts of gangland life and the mounting tensions within the club.  As the season progresses, it increasingly develops into a battle of viewpoints between Clay's world-weary cynicism and Jax's (relatively) idealistic leanings and pangs of conscience, which leads inexorably to a conclusion that already has me drooling in anticpation of season two.<br /><br />In another welcome parallel with The Shield, the show's writing gets progressively more complex and nuanced as the season goes on, giving the cast, a nice assemblage of recognizable (but not household) names, a lot of room to work.  Further cementing his status as Hollywood's leading Jewish tough-guy actor, Perlman is impossible not to watch as Clay, the club leader who walks a fine line between toughness and ruthlessness.  Clay's a classic antihero in the Tony Soprano-Vic Mackey mold, whose occasional moments of decency don't quite compensate for his myriad of bad acts, but he's practically a softie compared to his wife.  Taking the concept of standing by her men very seriously, Gemma's the very picture of steely determination, willing to say and do anything to safeguard her family, and she shares both Clay's ability to perceive all the angles and his lack of reservations in doing what needs to be done.<br /><br />For his part, Jax is certainly no saint, but he hasn't quite been won over to the Machiavellian value system championed by his mother and stepfather.  Constantly tugging at his conscience are the newly-discovered writings of his late father John, a somewhat intellectual type who didn't necessarily intend for the club to become a crime syndicate.  The voice-over narration of John's journal is a bit of a contrived device in a show largely devoid of them, but it does nicely frame the struggles that come to define the season.  This season also sees a succession of great supportingturns from recognizable faces--Jay Karnes as a twisted ATF agent with a thing for Jax's ex, Mitch Pileggi as a vicious Nazi meth lord, Ally Walker as an enjoyably amoral Fed who vows to take the Sons down--that only serve to up the entertainment quotient.  Even the law-enforcement officers--the shady, compromised Chief Unser and the more principled, by-the-book Deputy Chief Hale--eventually emerge as multi-dimensional characters in their own right.<br /><br />Overall, it's extremely difficult to find fault with this season.  SoA seems to have flown under the radar a bit while shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad get all the acclaim, and while those are both great shows I think SoA easily holds its own as one of the best on TV right now.  If it maintains its level of quality in season two, we viewers could have yet another all-time great on our hands.able faces--Jay Karnes as a twisted ATF agent with a thing for Jax's ex, Mitch Pileggi as a vicious Nazi meth lord, Ally Walker as an enjoyably amoral Fed who vows to take the Sons down--that only serve to up the entertainment quotient.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|Set in East Germany durign the closing years of the Cold War, a playwright runs afoul of the government and is subjected to surveillance. Georg Dreymon is a playwright who manages to stay in business by writing plays that conform to the socialist propaganda of the East German government. All is lost when a bureaucrat decides to move in on Dreymon's girlfriend, a prominent actress.  Despite his absolute innocense, Dreymon must be \\"removed\\", and a Stasi agent assigned to spy on him.  However, the Stasi agent assigned takes a completely unexpected course of action...    While we in America are subjected to such cinematic feces as \\"Dude, Wheres my Car?\\", or \\"American Pie\\", Europe is still making films that mean something. This is one of them.    Its a German film, and it will likely lose the attention of Ashton Kutcher fans within 5 minutes, because its not in English. They are a lost cause anyway. American viewers with a bit more cerebral matter will pay close attention. Why? The events portrayed in this film will soon be common place in America, if you DON'T pay attention.    The posers currently occupying the White House are encouraging citizens to report anyone who opposes the pharoah's \\"health-care plan\\".     Speak to anyone from the former East Germany, and you will hear tales of a ruthless regime. East Germany had such a thorough hold on the people, that there was very nearly at least one informant in every family, by some estimates.    The reason for such severe surveillance was probably due to the fact that East Germany directly bordered the free Western NATO countries, namely West Germany. The communists in power realized that despite all their efforts, it was not possible to hide the freedom and better quality of life in the West. Too many East Germans had easy access to television and radio broadcasts from all points West, for one thing.    Of all the Warsaw Pact nations under the heal of the Soviet Union, East Germans were suppressed by the most thorough and ruthless secret-police that the Iron-Curtain could muster. No secret-police force ever kept as vast a network of informants as the Stasi. After the collapse of communism, citizens of East Germany were given free access to all the files kept on them. People were shocked to find that wives, husbands, relatives, friends, and co-workers had \\"informed\\" upon them for years! Electronic bugs were emplaced almost everywhere. In fact, people who had been arrested by the Stasi, and interrogated, had sweat-samples taken from them. This would be used at a later time, if the individual became a fugitive. The tracking dogs would be given the \\"olfactory sample\\", to chase down the fugitive.
B0000029LG|5.0|This double CD set is the greatest music from the \\"king of pop\\" of his career in my opinion. 1st CD is of his number 'ONES' . All his chart topping No. 1 Singles - great stuff! The stores are selling this CD separately entitled 'Ones'.....15 hits!.  Why buy that when you can have 2 CD's with 30 songs total.<br />The 2nd CD in my opinion is the absolute best single CD he ever put out. He was very upset in 1995 about his recent accusations and it reflects in his music. Making this a very emotional compilation of 15 new songs. Every one of these songs has a message for all of us about what he was experiencing. Incredible CD! and a must have!<br />Highly recommended!!!
1594201927|4.0|This is a good book that traces the evolution of money specifically the socio-economic symbiosis. Its interesting to see how the evolution of Money and its transforming role in the history of mankind. It almost proves that it is economics, and not chivalry that determined the defining moments in the history of mankind.  Though there are traces from Empire, the house of Rothschild found in this book, it follows a logical progression and holds the interest of the reader, and helps to go in detail to the earlier books.  The evolution of war and the bond markets, and the lead up to the Great Panic of 2007 was very good. It is a great economics history book, and it appeals to all ages.  Another master piece by Niall.
0451217403|1.0|There is an abiding tension between the two crafts of journalism and fiction.  The practitioner of the latter art searches out, and strings together, detail from real life in a careful arrangement, as a jeweler makes a pearl necklace.  The other gathers detail in the manner of a child picking up shells on a beach -- throwing them willy-nilly into a bucket -- constantly in search of the next, more shiny, example.<br /><br />Reading \\"The Godfather\\", one gradually comes to the realization that, while Mario Puzo may not be much of a novelist (or even a writer, for that matter), he certainly must have been a fine, tenacious reporter.  There are bits which appear to be lifted wholesale from real life, particularly in that thread of the story which follows Johnny Fontane.  Puzo demonstrates a formidable knowledge of the old Hollywood power structure, its parties, its hangers-on, its washed-up starlets, its lusty moguls, its corrosive effect upon the souls of those in its service.<br /><br />The problem is, however, Puzo never makes anything of these and other details. They are left hanging, unrelated to the development of the story and the characters.  The most fully realized character in the entire story is Johnny Fontane, of all people.  This is because the character is sunk in a fully-realized world (that Hollywood mentioned above) and ultimately takes on life as result of it.<br /><br />In some respects, Puzo's approach to novelism is very much of the Tom Wolfe school.  That is, the novelist is simply a journalist, in search of the \\"thousand-footed beast\\".  Although Wolfe is too much of a conscientious artist to see his own precepts through to their unfortunate end (particularly in \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\"), Puzo, a lesser artist, is an example of the danger that such a school may pose.  He piles on fascinating detail after detail, probably all the result of painstaking research, but without any regard for their organization or cumulative effect in relation to the story.<br /><br />In all, the result is not absolutely unreadable -- it is, however, an absolute failure as a work of art.the result is not absolutely unreadable -- it is, however, an absolute failure as a work of art.
B000002UHG|5.0|Richard Wright, keyboardist for Pink Floyd, wanted to create an album after the Division Bell tour was over in the mid 1990's.  It had been 18 years since his first solo work (the excellent Wet Dream from 1978), and the wait was worth it.  This is a four part song cycle based on the depression and recovery from depression of is wife.  The lyrics are mostly written by Anthony Moore, who cowrote \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\" with Rick on the Division Bell.  Vocal tracks are interspersed with several instrumental tracks which add color to the recording.   The musicianship and production is top notch, Richard Wright is in fine voice plus Sinead O'Connor guest appears on two songs and really nails the vocals.      Although this did not sell well as Mr. Wright did not tour to support it, don't let the sales influence you.  He handles the subject matter quite well in mood and tone.  It is possibly the best of the Pink Floyd solo albums. An excellent addition to any Pink Floyd or prog rock collection.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of those books that will touch your soul.  I am not particularly a racing fan, I don't have anything against it - just a little uninformed.  It doesn't matter with this book.  I am a dog owner and have had older dogs who seem wise beyond any human that I know and Enzo is one of these dogs.  His insight into his family and how in touch he is with their humanity is both emotional and at times funny.  The reader really starts to believe that what he believes is true.  I have had a dog, three wonderful shelties, in my adult life for almost 29 years.  I do talk to my dogs the way that Denny talks to Enzo and I want to believe that my dogs understand me the way that Enzo understands the people around him.  Enzo believes in his people, Enzo believes in Karma, Enzo believes that he will come back as a human so that he can tell Denny what a wonderful person he is - you will want to believe in all of this too.  This is just one of \\"those\\" books, the kind that you want to run tell all of your friends about as soon as you finish reading it.

Maybe it is the fact, that this wolf saved her life once. Meanwhile, Sam leads two lives. One in the forest during the winter, watching a girl. Another in the summer, where he has a few moments of being human until he gets turned back by the cold.<br />An another attack has happened again, but unlike Grace, Jack is dead and his family wants something to happen. A hunting party has gathered to kill all the wolves in the forest. Grace goes to stop them and on her back porch, she finds a boy with those same yellow eyes. It is her wolf somehow. Winter is near, so Grace and Sam have to find a way to stop him from changing.<br />I loved Shiver. It was a quick and cute read. I am not a huge fan of doomed love, but Grace and Sam were so cute. Grace's obsession with wolves was different, but in this book, it really fitted it. It is well known that I fall for fictional characters and Sam is in there. He is really sweet, honest, and cute. It doesn't hurt that he worked in a bookstore. The plot was also very fast and entertaining. I loved the new approach to werewolves. It was original. Stiefvater is an amazing writer and I need to check out her other books. If you are looking for a paranormal romance, this is a book for you.
B0019LY5I2|3.0|Please people do not take this movie so serious. Character development is not necessary in a movie where you want to see sick fights and things get blown up, which is exactly what happens in this movie. This is not an Oscar contender that is driven on strong acting performances, what it is, is a really fun action movie with some cool fights, great action and some hot chicks. Once you realize that, then maybe you'll realize G.I. Joe was a good movie.

The screenwriter & director chose to put way too much emphasis on the fact all of the beloved characters we met as children are now hormonally active teenagers and as a result the action and suspense from the book has been almost completely gutted from the film, especially in the ending. This is the weakest of the HP films so far, but for hardcore fans, as always, any HP film is one worth seeing. And for the casual fans my advice to you on this film is that a better use of your time (The film is 2 ½ hours long!) & money would be to buy the book and start reading.

The film looked better than I expected, yes edge enhancement is overdone in some scenes, but overall it looked great.  The surround sound was excellent. As to the film, the first two thirds is great, the last seems overloaded and rushed, with too much historical detail, a lot of it could have been made into another film. I enjoyed the film more this time around.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!      I was asked to upgrade my rating for this film and I agree............. in tribute to my belief that this is one of the best crafted horror movies I have ever seen.  Just be aware that I still believe that the Blu Ray is not a upgrade from the original DVD.  I have both and it is NOT better from the fans aspect IMHO.  I wish the original negatives could be found so we could get a better transfer.

This book is at the foundation of curricular materials produced by the Harvard Negotiation Project, Educators for Social Responsibility and many Mediation models. Because of its impact in the field, it is essential reading. It is important to keep in mind that this book was written for adults. I find some of the \\"strategy\\" manipulative.

Each time I realize how what a classic this movie will be.  This is a terrific movie!    JULIE & JULIA could have earned 10 STARS just on the summer film clips!    Nora Ephron is a terrific writer and director!  We  have seen all of her movies at least 3 or 4 times.   After viewing all the summer film clips,  we knew that  JULIE & JULIA would be no exception.  It was obvious that Julia was not really dead - Julia lives on in the great acting of Meryl Streep.  Meryl is surely the Julia we always knew and loved in our home.     We have 7 sons and in our home on \\"JULIA night\\" someone would run through the house shouting, in Julia's voice, \\"JULIA'S ON! JULIA'S ON!\\" All 9 of us would gather in the large master bedroom - sprawled out on the bed, on the floor, in chairs or on a sofa at the end of the bed - laughing at and lovin' on Julia Child. This film  brings back such great memories for our family.  We actually watched YouTube clips of the film yesterday and laughed with tears in our eyes.     Much like Julie in JULIE & JULIA, I am a fan of Julia Child!  I can akimbo a chicken in 3 minutes flat!  I also own Larouse Gastronomique!  I am a Julia fan until I die!    I knew this would be my FAVORITE movie of the year.  It is!

B002436WFI|3.0|Terry Pratchett is the king of satirical comedy and this movie is a faithful rendition of his first book. Casting was well-done and for those who are Discworld fans, this is a fairly accurate version (better than most 'based on a book' movies). However, Terry was still 'finding his feet' at this time, and both the book and the movie reflect that. If you haven't read Pratchett before, start with the books and then give the movie a try. Otherwise, you might find yourself lost in the twisting alleyways of the Shades.

This DVD has helped me to lose all of my baby weight (50 lbs) and look better than before I had my baby... and she is only 3 months old!  I recommend this to anyone looking to get in shape without spending loads of time doing it!

0316042994|5.0|Brideshead Revisited is in many ways an anomalous work in the oeuvre of Evelyn Waugh. Better known for his scathingly funny satires, Waugh, in writing this novel, turned his freewheeling wit and awe-inspiring command of the English language toward writing what is perhaps his most serious work. The book is nonetheless, in many places, hilarious--but more so, from start to finish, Brideshead Revisited is charming, convincing, and infinitely compelling in providing a timeless panorama of English youth and high society whose power and beauty transcends all cultural barriers.    I've heard all the criticisms of this book--I've heard Martin Amis accuse it of snobbery for its defense of English nobility; George Orwell ridicule the conservative sentiments of Waugh that sometimes seep into the novel; and many a critic denounce the novel's attempts to unite the story with theology as a failure. But none of that matters to me, because Brideshead Revisited was one of the few books I've read that I sincerely regretted finishing, for the sole reason that I'd rarely read a book that so thoroughly engrossed, entertained, and enlightened me.    Well nigh all of the characters, minor and major alike, attract the reader's unwavering interest, often accompanied by a strong sense of sympathy, scorn, or even both. The book centers on the relationship of the protagonist, Charles Ryder, with the entire Flyte family, an aristocratic clan of Catholics who fascinate Ryder. Without giving away too many specifics, Brideshead Revisited, before its duration is spent, will relate one of the most authentic accounts of male friendship in literature, as well as what is, in my view, one of few literary love affairs whose ultimate success I found myself passionately rooting for all the way. From the witty and eminently likable Sebastian, to the sometimes endearingly maladroit Bridey, to the tragic Lady Marchmain, to the radiant and resolute Julia, the Flytes are one of the best-developed and most intriguing families you'll ever read about. As their stories, and Charles', unfold and interwine, the novel marches toward its inevitable and all-too-human conclusion, while drawing the reader closer and closer with every turn of the page--with some help from a stellar supporting cast.    Perhaps the aspect of the book that fascinates me the most is, although all of the characters an events therein are figments of Waugh's imagination, one gets the irrepressible sense that the story could have played out no other way. The novel, of course, is rife with Waugh's choice themes and motifs--but to me those, and their alleged flaws, are all secondary concerns, because Brideshead Revisited is masterly storytelling at its pinnacle.
0385340575|4.0|Lee Child is one of my favorite authors and I am partial to his writings. This book was not one of his best, but I enjoyed it and look forward to more Jack Reacher stories. Jack is one of those people you would like to meet and you envy his independence and his intuition. This book was a little slow, but it did come to a good ending.  I would recommend the book and perhaps, suggest they read \\"One Shot\\" or \\"Bad Luck and Trouble:.
B001OQCV9M|4.0|Those of us who grew up watching television in Canada in the late 1950s (when there was only one TV channel) remember our first TV chef -- \\"Madame Benoit\\" --  who began ALL her recipes (as my mother liked to joke) \\"First . . . take a pound of butter.\\"<br /><br />Meryl Streep, in a recent interview, publicizing her film portrayal of the \\"superchef\\" with the distinctive voice (that everyone thinks they can impersonate, at least enough to warble the French expression, \\"Bon appetit!\\") - Meryl Streep summed up her \\"Julia\\" cooking experience, in similar fashion:<br /><br />\\"Yeah, I learned to cook (in the movie scenes filmed in Paris) and I'm not that good,\\" said Meryl. \\"But, you know, [if] you put butter on anything, it really does taste better!

B001MYIXAC|1.0|It's rare that I'll use such a strong term as `hate' having watched a film, mainly because I'm very choosy in the first place and try to weed out the abundance of claptrap out there by way of going with established filmmakers and critics reviews. It's also quite rare that I will go so completely against the prevailing opinion when I find myself disagreeing with it, but I find myself utterly in that situation here - I actually hated this film and I'm all the more confused when I look at the mass of rave reviews for Let the Right One In.    So let me try to explain why I feel this way. Firstly, I love slow burners, meditative films that take their time and don't resort to a big set piece every ten minutes to cover emptiness - however, usually what these films offer are interesting characters and plots to maintain interest and to have a point to them. Let the Right One In had neither of these. In fact I found the whole film completely devoid of suspense, drama, intrigue, atmosphere, in fact anything that could be considered impressive or make the whole exercise worthwhile in the first place.    The acting from the two main kids was utterly awful, very stilted and awkward. There was a general lack of dialogue in their scenes, they tended to just walk around each other, mutter something or hug and it quickly got very tiresome. And I'm sorry if this sounds a little heartless but why would the director assume that the largely adult (at least intended) audience would be interested in the development of a friendship between a couple of kids, even if one of them does happen to be a vampire?    My second problem with the film was that it had a major problem with it's flow. In fact, I would sum up the film as three of four dramatic set pieces linked by a lot of very mundane scenes of a lot of very mundane characters talking a lot of very mundane dialogue. And I feel the director may have also felt this, which would explain the reason for including the other character who beginsto turn into a vampire after being bitten by Eli. Other than providing an opportunity to reinforce some vampire stereotypes and a dramatic death scene, there was no point that I could see to her even being in the film other than to perhaps offer an explanation (you know for the benefit of those who don't know what a vampire is!) as to why Eli doesn't go out during the day and does what she/he does to people. Her narrative thread otherwise had no relevance to the friendship between the two leads which was the main focus and `point'.    And the `dramatic' set pieces were downright silly - the scene where Eli kills the man in the bathroom was embarrassingly bad - not because it was low key but because it looked like a guy was playing a prank on his mates from behind the door. Even the swimming pool scene at the end didn't make sense - would the bully still bother to keep Oskar's head underneath the water while the rest of his gang were being butchered and decapitated around him?    I guess my last main reason for disliking the film was because it seemed to think it was a lot more profound and artistic than it was. In fact, throughout, when there was any dialogue it was extremely mundane - take the example in the hospital scene where the guy is at his wife's bedside - he starts talking to her about a stamp collection! What? It seems the director was just filling in dead time with hot air - and there were many many scenes like this. I'm sorry, but at the end of the day, this film said nothing remotely interesting about friendship or adolescent growing pains - sad lonely faces and handprints against the glass are not enough!    I suppose I'll have to remain bemused at the wealth of rave reviews for this film but for me it didn't work on any level and had absolutely no redeeming features.
B001M6AHVS|5.0|Excellent selection of tunes from the best years of Motown. Great way to hear James Jamerson on the bass guitar. Outstanding sound quality too.
B001OQCV9M|4.0|It's great to see an entertaining grown-up movie make a strong summer debut.  We saw \\"Julie & Julia\\" with a full-house crowd who clearly enjoyed themselves.  I recommend the movie, yet I can't help but feel that because the story cut back between the two women's stories, I did not really get to know either one of them on a deep level.    Meryl Streep was fantastic but I was frustrated that her Julia was so unfailingly polite and \\"on,\\" as though she were performing for an audience, even in her private moments.  She was *always* lovely to her husband; quirky, fun, winning over even the French.  It's not that I wanted to see her show a \\"dark side,\\" just a more human side than we got in her slices of life.  Didn't she have any flaws, any times she was really ready to give up on her writing career when it took so long to take off?  The few times she was profane or sad, she still seemed so polished.    Amy Adams did well in her role as blogger Julie Powell, and I didn't find her character as unlikeable as some reviewers have.  It's just that alongside Julia Child herself, it's not easy for a blogger emulating Julia Child to hold up her end of the story.  The intercutting hurts the story's momentum--each time Child's story gets rolling, we have to cut back to Julie Powell's sad little life in Queens, NY.    Finally, Powell's story gets a little self-referential as her writing career takes off, a fact that film cheekily acknowledges by saying in the end credits, \\"Julie Powell's book was made into a film.\\"  I almost expected to see Amy Adams as Powell sitting in a development meeting at the end.    Overall, I definitely recommend the film, which is Nora Ephron's best work since [[ASIN:B0000AOV4I Sleepless in Seattle]] (screenwriter/director) and [[ASIN:B000XJD33O When Harry Met Sally...]](screenplay).  I rate the film three and a half stars, rounded up to four when pressed.    And I hope it goes without saying--eat well before you head to the theater!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This little book attached itself to my heart and pulled me along a wonderful and horrible trail. I was initially attracted to the novel idea of a story narrated by Death. I wasn't dissapointed by the actual rendering of this novelty in the least, but i was more than a little surprised at how thouroughly the story itself gripped me. I'm glad that this book caught my eye; it was an entirely satisfying read.
B001SN78JO|1.0|The film is based around a frustrated middle aged man \\"Carl\\" whose life changes after attending a self help seminar that requires attendees to say \\"yes\\" to new opportunities in their lives.      The key theme of the movie is built around the notion that for the character universally agreeing to everything will improve his life (SANJI: \\"I want you to do something for me, Carl. Tomorrow, I want you only to say yes. Can you do that for me?\\").  At various occasions throughout the script the characters show the futility of the overall concept when they don't follow through the \\"yes to everything notion\\": i.e. when asked if he \\"hates his country\\" he disagrees although at that stage in the story Carl should have learnt that \\"saying yes\\" is the only option to avoid negative consequences. So, the overall idea of the story definitely falls in the \\"rather infantile\\" category.     Sometimes lack of story can be recovered by witty or funny dialogue and interesting character development. Unfortunately \\"Yes Man\\" doesn't offer either. Rarely have I had to endure more stereotypical, predictable character development (bad unlikeable guy changes his life and finds love on the way\\" and dialogue that is so blatantly stupid and truly just not funny despite desperate aims to be that.     I cannot be accused of not being a fan of politically incorrect elements in stories but I just could not see any necessity of scenes were in a detailed fashion (multiple minutes) the topic of forced oral sex of the character with a 70+ toothless lady is covered. In addition to all that movie includes an \\"orgy of product placement\\" to an extent that I have never seen before. The sad climax of this is a scene that goes on for more than half a minute with the Red Bull energy drink at its centre. It feels like somebody has accidently edited in a commercial product ad into a professional feature film.     Finally: I have tried hard to find anything of value in this story and related movie. Unfortunately I havefailed and can only warn everyone not to waste ninety valuable minutes of her/his life on this movie horribly gone wrong...
B0017KIBAI|5.0|It's straight up a standard Gamecube controller but colored to match a Wii. The cord for it seems to be about 10ft which (if I recall correctly) is much longer than the original Gamecube controller's cord was. I'd recommend it for anyone who needs a Gamecube controller in general or if you're looking for one for the Wii.

B00297FEUS|5.0|Ok, I have had audio problems with cd 1 so I sent the email to Rhino and ... problem solved. I have gotten the replacement cd with a TS pin and an apologies note from Jay Jay. I have to say that the remastering job was great. I put the original 1984 Stay Hungry and cut one song suddenly, and change to 25th anniversary edition without change the volume level and I could see the difference.... 25th anniversary sounds deeper and stronger. Well, in essence, is the same Stay Hungry, of course, but it sounds much better. Now cd2. What can I say. If I wasn´t a TS fan (to death), I could be very angry. Why?, because these are uncomplete songs..... and early releases. Are they fooling me?, why they just use the 1983 releases instead use these \\"prototypes\\" and finish the songs?, as Dee did with Call my name?..... well, as I said, as a TS fan, I´m actually glad to have these songs. Be carefull, is just for truly fans. The new song?, I would have preferred something less \\"rock´n roll\\" and more heavy metal. You know, is a good new song, also it has its video, good one, but for TS, and Dee special attitude, I prefer songs like \\"Never Say Never\\", more heavy metal. But is just me. I prefer \\"heroes are hard to find\\" than \\"30\\" (I know Heroes... isn´t heavy metal, but.......), finally.......... How about a new TS album????????????????
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Let me confess one thing at the start. I have got the blu-ray of Taken, but I have so far been unable to watch it. But I did watch the Digital Copy that came with it, installed on my PC, during a plane ride. One thing I noticed was that the Digital Copy was of very good quality, with little or no artefacts despite the many night scenes.  My first impression was, who would have thought Liam Neeson would make such a good hero ? Credit goes to whoever took the decision to cast him as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA type with deadly skills. His daughter's kidnappers in Paris would learn what these skills are as the film progresses from one action scene to another. It barely pauses, except for the initial 20 minutes when there's not much action.  There have been a number of `rescue-your-kidnapped-daughter' films, most noticeably Man on Fire and Commando. These two featured much younger daughters than Taken. But in the end, Taken is more emotionally satisfying (if you can use that term for a film in which around 50 people get killed) than either of them.   I saw somewhere on the Net Taken being described as a `horror' film. Yes, it is a nightmare for parents for if their offpring is `Taken' by kidnappers.  Neeson is superb as the distraught father, though his acting won't win Oscars in a film like this. The storyline, though containing some plot holes, is believable. Trafficking in young women is a serious problem especially in poorer countries, though the West is not immune, as depicted in the film. Taken producers deserve thanks for highlighting this problem.   Taken is a thrill ride you will not forget in a hurry. The camerawork is excellent, the action sequences are brilliant and the dialogues are snappy. Action must be Taken to buy this film.
0316168815|2.0|Lovely Bones came to me highly recommended, so I was excited to read it on a recent coast-to-coast flight.  It started off intense and gripping, from the detached description from the dead girl of her own killing, to the heart-wrenching reactions and realizations that followed among friends and loved ones: hope and fear and finally despair and dealing.  Sebold did a good job of stringing the reader along as the story followed the progressions of the living and the dead.  She crafted some suspenseful moments, each of which could have sent the story in a new and interesting direction, but each time the tension was resolved too quickly, too easily.  Maybe she felt she could not impose more trauma on the reader after starting the story so violently.  Instead, the events recounted were disappointingly safe and mundane.  Even so, I kept hoping that the pieces would ultimately pull together to form a satisfying conclusion.  Unfortunately Sebold was not able to pull this off and in the end the story lacked cohesion and purpose.  I never got a sense of transcendence or lessons to be learned, or even the simple satisfaction of a mystery solved.  Ultimately the book was extremely depressing, not because of the relentless reminder of \\"girls and women\\" who are hurt and killed (as an aside, what about boys and men with the same fate?) but because of the suggestion that the best one can hope for is to the blessing of mundane cliches, both in life and in death.

B0019LY5I2|2.0|By now everyone has heard that \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" (2009) is a rather sad exercise in excess, although no worse than other digital effects cartoons with actors superimposed on the screen (much cheaper than creating actual sets and paying a real production designer).  So I will just highlight a few random points.    This is what screenwriters call a \\"moron movie\\"; with a target audience so unsophisticated that suspension of disbelief is irrelevant-as disbelief requires conceptual reasoning ability. For a writer this sort of project is a dream job  because there are no logic constraints on the action; strengths and weaknesses do not have to be consistent between characters, between weapons, or even between segments in the same production.  Each moment exists as if it is a short independent clip and the writer cannot box themselves into a corner and can simply ignore continuity considerations. Nothing wrong with the concept, morons need to be entertained like anyone else and there are worse things than dumbing yourself down for a couple hours; so think \\"Rambo\\" (2008) if you want something geared for the same audience.    The franchise dates back to the Action Man figures launched in Britain in 1966 by Palitoy; licensed to them by Hasbro who had introduced GI Joe a couple years earlier.   In 1982 it crossed the ocean back to the USA and inspired by elements from Marvel Comics' \\"Nick Fury Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\"  was renamed \\"Action Force\\".   Names were changed but all the basic characters, organizations, missions, and gadgets can be found in those mid-60's Nick Fury comic books.      The just released film attempts to package all the background information, characterization, gadgets, the evil plot to rule-the-world story, and 150 minutes of exercise-in-excess digital effects into 118 minutes.    As you can imagine things got a little rushed and a lot of basic stuff got left on the cutting room floor; but almost everything on the special effects hard drives madeit into the final cut.   So there was no time to build up any anticipation or suspense.  And each time the rival organizations try figure out the location of each others assorted  lairs, the producers did not have the luxury of  incorporating cerebral exercises in detection; the locations are just lamely revealed.  Real movies can get 60 minutes of mentally engaging quality running time from solving this type of puzzle.    None of the male characters are worthy of note nor are the actors who play them.  The talent-challenged Dennis Quaid (playing the Nick Fury based character) is not required to act; he just plays himself again which is something to be thankful for as is his minimal screen time.  But the guys in the theater where I watched the movie were only there to see Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols parade around in the tight costumes seen in all the promo material.      Yes they have a short hyper-edited catfight, but it is an extremely sterile one and in the middle of the film; which was a disappointment.   Yes Miller (in her much advertised outfit) looks hotter than you have ever seen her (actually I doubt that anyone until now has viewed this tiny actress as especially hot) and seems to be having fun playing against type as the evil Baroness; she is light years ahead of the rest of the cast in basic thespian ability.   But it turns out that the Baroness is not really evil, which was a disappointment although interesting to observe how this revelation quickly causes her to slip several steps down on the hotness scale.  Producers should take note of the dynamic-bad girls are only hot if the viewer thinks they are bad girls.    Nichols is poorly showcased and underutilized.  While unfortunate visually, as she  would  have been even more stunning than Miller in that outfit; her lack of screen time is another thing to be thankful for; you know what I mean if you have ever been subjected to her Kathy Ireland quality acting skills (her only emotion is a look of stunned surprise).      Personally I think George Lucas has a copyright infringement claim against the producers; as the staging of the Snake Eyes vs Storm Shadow showdown bears more than a coincidental resemblance to Luke vs Darth Vader  in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" (1983).   And the COBRA headquarters (and the climatic attack on it) will remind you of the Death Star; although oddly not as effective visually - maybe models are better than digital generation after all.  This is all obvious enough to actually be parody; perhaps the brains of the production staff needed some exercise after being unchallenged by the other elements of the movie.    Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
B00000J7S8|5.0|When I Look Into Your Eyes by Diana Krall is a CD that I have had for some number of years, but it has gone in and out of my listening rotation based on the \\"phase\\" that I'm in.  However, this is one of my absolute favorite piano/vocal jazz CDs in my entire collection.  When I Look Into Your Eyes is a collection of cover tunes, and as such it is more instructive to limit evaluation to the instrumentation and vocal delivery.  One of the things that make this CD so great is that it strikes a wonderful balance in tracks that incorporate an orchestra and those that do not.  The title track has a broad, sweeping sound backed by the Orchestra, but it is also strikingly beautiful and simple on the verses as Krall's vocals are backed by guitar with faint orchestral strings.  Other standout orchestral tracks are \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" and \\"Why Should I Care\\" - the hidden Track 13.  Her vocal delivery conveys powerful emotion that will strike all but the most calloused listener.  Contrast this sound against the more playful and traditionally instrumented \\"Devil May Care\\", \\"Popsicle Toes\\", and \\"East Of The Sun (And West Of The Moon)\\".  Krall's piano playing is as prominent on these tracks as her vocals are.  You could easily imagine hearing these tunes live in a jazz club/restaurant setting.  The split is almost 50/50 (7 orchestral, 5 not) on the When I Look Into Your Eyes, and it creates a very balanced, enjoyable listening experience.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Diana Krall, When I Look Into Your Eyes is a good place to start.  It is a richly balanced collection of piano jazz vocal tunes.<br /><br />Download this:  When I Look Into Your Eyes

B001IBIQU6|5.0|I feel compelled to voice my opinion after my last review of DM's Playing the Angel. These Sounds of the Universe are exactly what I look for with this band. I firmly believe that this is the best thing they have ever done with the exception of Violator (of course).    This album is amazing. I can't put it down. Too bad they've released two of the weakest songs as singles(?). Wrong & Peace don't compare to tracks like The Truth Is/Miles Away or In Sympathy or Fragile Tension.
B001W79MB8|4.0|Sword of the Stranger is an action movie. The movie takes itself seriously. And despite this being the directors first movie, the attention to detail with the environment prevents it from feeling like a static world. The very limited amount of humor present helps to keep the mood right for the film, but could turn some away. The level of gore is high at times, but not so bad you can't look.  Like most action films, there is a story. And like most action films it isn't the most memorible story. However, the animation quality and the music are great. The Japanese voice actors do an excellent job. Some fan favorites from live-action were casted for major roles. And the young boy that did the voice for the youngest character is spot on. Despite the story not grabbing me like other movies recently, there is a point and there is some character development. The treatment of the Chinese forces present in the film is not in the best light (as expected with Japan). But, interestingly the characteristics that the Japanese characters show are not any better.  Even though I have high praise for this movie, it simply doesn't have much more to offer on blu-ray than with DVD. The picture quality is not vastly improved. It doesn't look bad, it just doesn't look much better than on DVD. That is the only reason I have given this 4/5 stars and not 5/5.
0375826726|2.0|I was quite taken by the first book in this series.  I was impressed by Paolini's depth and his character development.  The book sucked me in and I was very excited when I heard they were making the movie - even before the series was completed.<br /><br />The second in the series was not as good as the first book, but was still enjoyable and I looked forward to the movie and the \\"final\\" trilogy....so when the third book came out and I found out it was not going to be the last one - I had misgivings.  Was this a play for more money, or the author actually had more in his head than would fit in only 3 books????  After finishing the book - that I spent 20 bucks on (had to have the hardcover edition) I realized my first assumptions were probably true.  The book was utterly disappointing and badly edited.  The characters floundered around without accomplishing anything.  All the subplots make me think that this \\"trilogy\\" might turn into a lot more than Paolini first led on.  He should have borrowed from the masters - such as the Dragonlance series - you write a trilogy (Dragonlance Chronicles) , which leads to another trilogy (Dragonlance Legends), which leads to another trilogy (Dragonlance The Raistlin Chronicles). But, Paolini is a not Margaret Weis or Tracy Hickman.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I am amazed at the others that do not like this album. I feel like we are not reviewing the same album. These reviews prompted me to write mine. It is super album, and she has shown me another side of her singing talent. The songs are a wonderful selection that brings out her true talents. I hope she does more. She makes these songs feel!! Her renditions are both moving and touching. I do not know what others were looking for but to me all I can say is WOW!!!! If you like Diane then \\" DONT walk on by \\"
0061854549|5.0|This should be must reading for all MBA students, and highly recommend for anyone who lives in the real world. Most business students are taught a number of elegant, algebraically sound models such \\"supply and demand, \\"cost benefit\\", \\"expected economic return\\", etc.  The goal of using these models is to guide and help predict human behavior, especially with respect to economic decisions: \\"what car should I buy, what securities should I invest in, where should I live?\\" and so on.  The underlying assumption is that human behavior is rational, and that behavior is motivated by rational evaluation of the cost and benefits our actions.     Dan Ariely gives us all sharp rap to the side the head with an entertaining reminder that much of our behavior is not rational, most especially behaviors which we assume to be highly rational and logical. Ariely sites a number of experiments that show sharp counterexamples to commonly accepted assumptions about how our decision making processes work in areas ranging from how much we're willing to pay for coffee to how much we're willing to pay for medicine to how (if) we practice safe sex. He goes on to talk about the implications of these decision making processes and how they can lead us astray or at a minimum lead us to unexpected results, which may be baffling to our supposedly rational selves.     The lessons he conveys are both amusing and sobering; perhaps can be summed up as \\"we're not as smart as we think we are\\".  A lesson that never gets old, because as humans we never really learn it.     Ariely writes in a breezy and accessible style, very unusual for a professional academic, and almost unheard of for an economics professor. He's created a fun, easy read that will leave you thinking deeply about your own behavior - and thinking twice before you sign up for that free magazine subscription.

031606792X|1.0|Stephenie Meyer has the potential to be a good writer.     Notice I say potential.    I could go on and on about the flaws in this book.    The way Bella is a perfect \\"Mary Sue\\" character, except for her overdiscussed clumsyness, the fact that she and Edward don't like each other and then suddenly they're in love.     Or that Edward has no personality. Except for his perfection.    And, of course, he sneaks into her room to 'watch her sleep', before she even knows he likes her.     Yes, you read that line right.     And now millions of teenage girls are saying \\"He watches her sleep? How romantic.\\"     Then, of course, Bella goes to Port Angles, where she- of course!- gets stalked by a gang. But Edward heroically shows up to save the day.     Then he carts her off to some meadow, where he telles her all of the Great Vampire Secrets. For example, he confesses that he and his 'family' (coven) are all \\"vegetarian\\". That is, they only eat animals, not people.     And yes, he sparkles for her.    Did Meyer say 'Well, I don't want my Mary Sue vamps to die in sunlight, so they should sparkle.\\"?     So by this point they are hopelessly in lust. Though they claim they're \\"in love\\", Bella just ends up marrying him for sex.     But after their stunt in the meadow, Edward takes her to meet his vampire family. Then they play vampire baseball.    Vampire baseball?    And while they're playing Vampire Baseball, another coven shows up. James, Victoria and Laurent. James, of course, is a great tracker, blah blah blah, and wants to eat Bella for dinner.    So Edward's 'sister' Alice and his 'brother-slash-brother-in-law' Jasper take Bella off to Phoenix, Arizona, where she lived prior to the self sacrificing decision to move to Forks, WA.    And in Phoenix, of course, Bella acts in the most self-sacrificing and unrealistic way possible, requiring Edward to come to the rescue.    I can kind of see why so many people love this book. What teenage girl wouldn't want to read about a handsome, perfect, sparkly vampire?     But, to be honest, if this is the Big Book of the Decade (not counting HP) I fear for the future of our country.     I give Stephenie Meyer an 8/10 for her writing style. She gets a 4/10 for her plot and characters.     This 500+ page book could easily be 200 or 300 pages.

It is an easy read though so if you are after something to occupy yourself for a few hours and open your mind to new ideas (if you can get past the author's annoying prose) then it's worth a look.

B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Dude... I never went to see this movie in theaters. Matter of fact I bought it cheap out of the ten dollar bin. I figured that the movie would be a no brainer action flick that I'd only watch once. In my opinion, (and I mean MY OPINION, this movie isn't for everyone), this was one of the most surprising and best movies I have ever seen. Wanted is very unique.   Call me crazy but I thought that the story was awesome. I loved the main character. He isn't your typical hero. Unlike other superheroes we know such as Spider-Man and the X-Men, this guy is just out to do for himself. He starts as a pitiful minimum wage worker that has nothing to live for and ends as a cocky bad ass that is taking control of his future. I loved the main theme song as well. It totally fits the mood of the story.   The action that I thought would be decent turned out to be amazing. Every time something happened I was either shouting WOW or nothing at all since my mouth would be hanging open in disbelief.   In my personal opinion I give this film 5/5. But believe me, I'm not stupid. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! I would never recommend it to my parents or any adult for that matter. This movie is strictly for teens to young adults.
0143038419|3.0|I got this book because my mom and I were going to Bali, so I heard it was a good book to read before.  I found it just ok.  It was a bit boring and hard to get into.  It got better as it went on, but I never really got into it.  My mom tried to read it after me, and ended up just skipping to the Bali part because she couldn't get into it. I gave it three stars, because I like the overall story and what her journey, but I felt it could have been shorter and more intriguing! Really, I think it deserves 2.5 stars, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt!
B001993Y2C|3.0|I am so glad that there are other people that agree the packaging on this box set is a sham. I was very very disappointed when I got the box set opened up and tried to get out the first DVD for viewing. I feel that there may be damage done to the DVDs over time with the way they have to be pulled out and put back in. $200+ is a lot of money to be throwing down on something like this and then have the DVDs damaged not due to misuse, but terrible packaging. The packaging should have looked like what this guy came up with on his own. Check it out: [...]  I wish Universal would recall this series and give me a replacement with a better packaging system.

B002KGREJW|4.0|Every year has at least one quirky movie that really captures your heart and imagination, and in the year 2006, that little movie was \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\"<br /><br />Yes, it's another dark comedy about a quirky, dysfunctional family. But \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" approaches the family dysfunction from a bizarre, smart, and sometimes slightly nuts perspective. This indie movie deserves all the credit that is being heaped on it -- it's truly glorious.<br /><br />Richard (Greg Kinnear) is an anxious motivational speaker who talks a lot about \\"winners\\" and \\"losers,\\" which is pretty funny when one considers that his family is full of oddities. His wife Sheryl (Toni Colette) is on edge as Richard inflicts his nine-step program on the family, and her Proust-scholar brother has just arrived, after a failed suicide attempt.<br /><br />And then there's little Olive (Abigail Breslin) -- she's wants to be in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and is being coached by her outspoken, heroin-snorting grandfather. When she gets into the pageant, the family piles into a minibus to go to Redondo Beach. Unfortunately, the trip exposes all the problems they have -- death, disappointment, suicide and lost dreams. And a broken clutch.<br /><br />If you're going to make a dark comedy about a family, then for crying out loud, give it a heart. \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" realizes this, in a little family world where a wordless hug speaks more than dozens of empty lines. These people drive each other crazy, don't ever communicate, but they really do love each other -- yes, even foulmouthed Grandpa.<br /><br />But lest anyone think it's syrupy, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris wrap it in a wicked cocoon of clever humor. \\"Sarcasm is the refuge of losers,\\" Richard says smugly, only to receive a sarcastic \\"REALLY?\\" He's not the only one: each character has his or her own odd spots, and a unique way of expressing it. (\\"High school's your prime suffering years! You don't get better suffering than that!\\").<br /><br />And while a road trip sounds dull, Dayton and Faris drop little incidents through it that keep it fresh, even if it's just hiccups from the horn. The climax of the strangeness is the \\"Fawlty Towers\\"esque smuggling of a dead body, and a truly surreal song-and-dance sequence. It has to score a 9.5 on the \\"bizarre endings\\" scale.<br /><br />Abigail Breslin is a simply brilliant little actress -- cute, yet not cutesy -- and she tends to fill up the screen with her natural appeal. The other actors wear their parts like comfy old sweaters, such as Colette's weary mother and her business-obsessed hubby, not to mention Alan Arkin's priceless turn as the drug-snorting patriarch.<br /><br />\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is a comedy as dark as it is funny, but somehow it never becomes depressing.

B00005J6T0|5.0|I was obsessed with Madonna growing up, and I remember this album when it first came out-I listened to her \\"Like A Virgin\\" album relentlessly in the 6th and 7th grade and \\"True Blue\\" as a terrific follow up.  Another reason this album is so great is Madonna also made some memorable music videos from these songs-the good old days of MTV. Awesome ablum cover first of all, and this CD is full of great, enjoyable bright Madonna music. Most of the songs are terrific and atleast a couple went to Number One on the charts. Madonna collaborated with Patrick Leonard who also co-wrote several of the songs. Easy to listen to and one of the most popular album of the 80s-true competition with so many other great 80s artists like Michael Jackson and Prince.     1-Papa Don't Preach-great song and this is one of Madonna's more famous songs about a young woman who's pregnant and afraid of being judged- 10 out of 10    2-Open Your Heart-Good song though forgettable-8 out of 10     3-White Heat-Great song, Madonna really uses her voice in this. Was never released as a single-9 out of 10    4-Live to Tell-Great, beautiful ballad-like song that is also used in the film \\"At Close Range\\" starring her then-husband Sean Penn. This song is still played on all of the light-rock stations and has stood the test of time. 10 out of 10    5-Where's the Party-Fun, fabulous song that really gets you moving. I don't think this was ever released as a single but this is one of the best songs on the album-10 out of 10.    6-True Blue-Good bubble-gum quality to this song-cute and uppity though not my favorite-8 out of 10    7-La Isla Bonita-Different sounding song with some Spanish lyrics but this is another favorite on the album-another one that has stood the test of time-10 out of 10    8.Jimmy Jimmy-Nah, kind of weak, allegedly written about James Dean with elementary lyrics. Not my favorite- 6 out of 10     9.Love Makes the World Go Round-Kind of a \\"filler\\" track that again, doesn't really leave its mark and the only weak song on the album-5 out of 10    \\"True Blue\\" is one of the best examples of pure Pop that we were lucky to have in the 80's,,,, you will enjoy it!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|You have to buy this movie! Oh my god, this movie is the most beautiful crime film ever (ironic huh?)! Clint Eastwood sure knows how to act, and the ending made me cry.

B0009XNUK0|4.0|This CD is pretty darn good if you want a buffet of most of Michael Jackson's best work and aren't bothered that some of the songs aren't the original length. Starting with some great Jackson 5 songs like \\"I Want You Back\\", \\"ABC\\" and \\"Rockin Robin\\", you are in awe at how talented little Michael is with that huge voice as a child. You wish you were around when he was singing with the Jackson 5! After the Jackson 5 songs, you get a very good taste of some great work at the beginning of Michael's solo career like \\"Ben\\" and a couple from The Jacksons. Several great songs that never got alot of airplay but are just as fabulous are \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground). Of course who can not like some of his Thriller Hits, \\"Human Nature\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", we've all heard these songs a hundred times before. The version of \\"Wanna Be Starting Something\\" is short-barely 4 minutes when the orginal is six minutes...so that irritated me. Another song that is great but never made it to number one is \\"Another Part of Me\\" also used in the Captain EO film at Disneyland, which we have all seen as kids. Two songs I have never really liked are \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" and \\"Leave Me Alone\\" are both on here and on the sleeve there is a mistake-they were not recorded in 1982. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is the same as the version on \\"Number Ones\\",, the radio edit. However, songs from one of my favorite albums, \\"Dangerous\\" make this album even better. The sexy \\"Dangerous\\" is in full-form, beautiful \\"Heal the World\\", \\"Remember the Time\\" and \\"Will You Be There\\" are more examples of Michael's great and diverse work.Unfortunately, \\"Jam\\" and \\"Earth song\\" (also from \\"Dangerous\\") are missing along with a couple of his better songs off of his last solo release, \\"Invincible\\", with the exception of \\"You Rock My World.\\" All in all, this CD is better than \\"Number Ones\\" because it has alot of less-known great songs from both MJ and the Jacksons, and also several of the ones thatwent to Number One. Good stuff and MJ will be missed greatly.
0312263511|5.0|I have just finished reading Gene Cernan's \\"Last Man On the Moon\\" for the 2nd time, and it was as good----or better----than the first time. Rather than repeat what the other 5 star reviewers stated, let me say that I have read literally thousands of books, and this has to be one the very best about America in the 1960's and 70's. He mentions all of the \\"horrors\\" of that time, the Charles Mansons, etc., but never loses track of his devotion to duty and to his family. He clearly had a deep love for his first wife Barbara and daughter Tracy, but Barbara, like so many military wives, became burned out by the never ending loneliness and fear for her husband, the travel, the partying, and the socializing.    Again, I reccommend this book without reservation.

B0009S2T0M|4.0|In OLDBOY director Chan Wook Park creates a tale of a decades long revenge that chews up everyone involved even the one seeking vengeance.  This Korean movie won numerous awards for its bitter view of humanity that demands harsh judgment on the eye for an eye theme.  OLDBOY follows a byzantine path that drops in and out of flashbacks and flashforwards as it recounts a bewildering plot that begins with a slighty chubby foul-mouthed drunk Oh Dae Su (Min Sik Choi) who winds up in a police station arrested for public intoxication. He is bailed out by a friend who takes him to a phone booth to talk to his wife.  At this point the plot takes on surreal turn as the drunk is kidnapped and imprisoned in a well-kept but barricaded hotel room for fifteen years. His captor, whose face remains unseen, ignores his request for the reason. Time passes slowly. Oh Dae Su learns from his television that his wife was murdered and the police believe him the culprit. His daughter was put up for adoption. He is unmercifully tormented until for no apparent reason he is released whereupon he seeks revenge.  The second half gradually shows how Oh Dae Su discovers the identity of his abductor who tells him that knowing WHO is responsible is much less important than finding out WHY.  The WHY is a multi-faceted prong of self-acknowledgment of guilt and expiation for sins past.  It is painful to watch events unfold. We do not want a hero protagonist to be less than the stern but upright heroes of most action films.  Oh Dae Su is deeply flawed, possibly in a Shakesperean sense that requires every Lear to be a mix of integrity and hubris.  The villain evokes some sympathy as we can almost hear him say from King Lear as Edmund: \\"Now gods. Speak up for bastards.\\" He sins mightily but we see that his sins tear him up.  There are no heros only victims here.  The ending is deliberately vague as we wonder how and to what extent Oh Dae Su can handle the truth of his most shattering of revelations.  We can only guess at that and this is why OLDBOY emerges as a tormented but brilliant import from Korea.n only guess at that and this is why OLDBOY emerges as a tormented but brilliant import from Korea.
1584282584|5.0|Disclaimers:   1. I do know Neil van Niekerk   2. I use very little flash    I've known Mr. Niekerk for more than a few years and there are few photographers for whom I have as much respect, personally or professionally.    While I am known for my \\"available light\\" work I do consider a mastery of light, be it available or supplemental, to be crucial for the production of great images.    Mr. Williams states, eloquently, in his foreword that we live in the age of the \\"quick-fix\\" during which period it really does seem to be de rigueur to eschew knowledge and learning.  If you recognize that \\"flash\\" is your weak point, or if you desire to improve your lighting skills & knowledge then I suggest that this book should not only be on your purchase list, at the top :), but also that you do spend the time reading, practicing and understanding the techniques and concepts presented in it, paying particular attention to Mr. van Niekerk's statement regarding manual exposure; \\"You decide. Not the camera.\\" This is of key importance and is often overlooked or neglected    The book itself is very well written, using precise, unambiguous language leaving little, if any, room for misunderstanding. The chapter subjects are comprehensive.  The diagrams are clear and concise and each and every photograph in the book illustrates its point very clearly.      My only issue with the foreword is that Mr. William's statement this \\"is a fantastic book\\" is that it is not in bold print!  It is indeed a fantastic book. It's not a quick fix, I don't believe it was ever intended to be one.  It does require reading and practice, after all practice does make perfect!    George Weir

B001E5FYS8|5.0|\\"Man on Wire\\" (2008) is a fascinating, suspenseful documentary with rare footage and some reenactments. On August 7, 1974, Philippe Petit an impish, pixyish Frenchman spent an hour tight-roping on a wire suspended between the towers of the World Trade Center. He spent months of preparation for his feat and gathered a team of helpers that included one inside operative. Incidentally there is no video footage of the event, but the film does include stunning still shots.<br /> Petit was a daredevil who was greatly challenged to perform amazing exploits. Previously he had tight-roped between the towers of Notre Dame and also the Harbor Bridge in Sydney, Australia, in 1973.<br /> He and his team traveled to the United States several times, planning and preparing, and they had made an aborted attempt. Back in France Petit practiced simulating the sway and wind conditions between the towers. We do see video footage of their planning sessions. Finally he hit on the idea of getting his wire across the vast open space, by shooting an arrow with a filament that could be tied to the tight rope itself.<br /> On the morning of August 7, he and an assistant went up in one tower while other members of the team went up the other tower to shoot the arrow across. He knew he was risking his life and his liberty for this dangerous stunt, but the Towers were irresistible to this daredevil.<br />After crossing several times, flaunting his balancing skills, he was arrested, sent to a mental facility for observation and eventually merely slapped on wrist for his daring stunt. The Towers proved irresistible to others because one man scaled one of the Towers.<br />As one who visited the Towers on occasion, it was very poignant seeing the Towers in all their glory in their early days. Because they were so famous, so massive and so iconic, they also proved to be an irresistible target to the terrorists on September 11, 2001. Those gleaming towers beckoned to daredevils, but unfortunately they attracted those crying out for attention by wreaking havoc.<br />The docu-drama is well-told, and it builds to a climax. The interviews with Petit and his associates add a great deal to the motivation behind the stunning event. Petit was determined, supremely self-confident, and egocentric. After he made his initial steps crossing the wire, his grim look turned to a smile of triumph.<br />Author Colum McCann has taken that day and created a critically acclaimed novel called \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" (2009) using the event as the fulcrum in the lives of a number of his fictional characters.ng out for attention by wreaking havoc.

B000055Y0X|5.0|I regard Dr. Strangelove as THE best Stanley Kubrick movie of all time.  Peter Sellers triple role is amazing.  George C. Scott actually agreed to do this movie to make an attempt at comedy in his career.  I believe he pulled it off quite well as Gen. Buck Turgison.  Sterling Hayden's portrayal as Col. Jack D. Ripper is unbelievable.  I think one of the best scenes is when Ripper is in his office and asks Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (one of three Peter Sellers roles) to make him a drink of grain alcohol and rain water.  Then he lights up this huge cigar and inhales a massive drag of smoke and looks into the camera with the smoke curling around his face.  THAT was Kubrick's money shot right there, and then of course we the audience, find out exactly how stark raving mad Ripper is when he rambles into his diatribe about the massive commie plot to sap and unpurify his precious bodily fluids.  I have watched this movie hundreds of times, and each time I laugh just as hard.  The lunacy of it all and to think that Kubrick was laughing in the government's face in 1963 when this film was made !  Right smack in the meat of the Cold War, and this movie comes out.  I remember my Dad was in the Air Force then, and this movie was actually BANNED around the WASH DC area where we lived at the time.  Now THAT is a statement on Kubrick's art and mastery as a film maker. I love this movie, and wish more film makers had the balls Kubrick did in '63 when this was made.

1400101123|3.0|To begin: I am not a die-hard Halo fan. In fact I have only just become familiar with it as a game for the first time. At the age of 51, I have been playing video games since they were invented; and still play them (as time allows)for recreation.   Over the years I had heard the rave about Halo, which was an \\"X-Box thingy\\". I had no X-Box, and desired no X-Box. I already have a  great PC (which is all an X-box really is), and my PS2: I'm game-geared enough.    I did finally purchase a copy of Halo: Combat Evolved for PC, and enjoy it tremendously, albeit with a few criticisms I will reserve for the game review.  I was however interested in the background storyline since so few FPS games actually have one. I'm an avid reader, but my eyes aren't as young as they once were, and I find audio books to be blessing. And so, I bought the \\"Fall of Reach\\".    First let me say that I enjoyed the story. Although as a former Marine I found many discrepancies in Mr. Nylund's authorship which I would have advised him better of. He's probably not a Veteran, and so has little idea of military protocol, let alone Marine Corps tradition; so I can be forgiving there. One thing you do NOT do, is call any bona-fidé \\"Marine\\" a \\"soldier\\"! That's an ARMY nomenclature they have a right to, not the Marines. My Army comrades  will acknowledge this distinction as well I trust.  Within the Marine Corps, one is first and foremost a \\"basic infantryman\\"... but never a \\"soldier\\".  They're not \\"G.I. Joes\\" either. The phrase \\"G.I. Joe\\" was coined during WWII, and was short for \\"General Infantry Man\\", aka - \\"Soldier\\".My Grand-Father was a \\"soldier\\", and a \\"Dough-Boy\\" in fact.  Anyhow, that's just a small gripe I have with his portrayal (albeit futuristic) of the Marines.    Another glaring error in the storyline is found where enlisted men are constantly SALUTING and addressing Petty Officers such as John 117! \\"Petty Officers\\" are enlisted members of the Armed Forces with Non-Commissioned Officer ranking; and like Corporals, Sergeants, etc; do NOT rate a salute or the title \\"Sir\\". My. Nylund's lack of military experience again reveals where he should have had a \\"Military Consultant\\" critique his work.    The real reasons for me giving it only 3 stars follows: (1) The audio leveling is horrible. The volume jumps between the Narrator's voice (which is great), and that of the characters he is voicing terribly. This is inexcusable from someone who surely has the resources to do it right.  As I said earlier, I may be no die-hard fan of Halo, but I am an audiophile, and do enough of my own sound engineering to know.  (2) While Todd McLaren did an admirable job of narration; this really should have been a multi-player Cast project. For Pete's sake! At least have a FEMALE voice actress to do Cortana and Dr. Halsey's parts. With all due respect to Todd: He SUX at doing female impersonation. And I would argue that such a highly acclaimed project as this DESERVES better treatment, hence a full cast of voice actors would be a reasonable expectation.  Also, the sound effects are sadly lacking. There's no real sense of the situation being conveyed.    All in all: This is a GOOD audio book which could have been much better given a little effort. \\"Buyer's regret\\"? NONE. Would I recommend it? YES... with the above reservations.
1439138311|5.0|OK, Man Booker award people, listen up! If this book doesn't win this year, you are dead to me, you hear?<br /><br />Colm Toibin is a genius. This is a man who has, on various occasions brought me inside the heads of:<br /><br />* a gay man in Ireland suffering from AIDS, and the women in his family (\\"The Blackwater Lightship\\")<br />* a compromised Argentine English teacher exploring his sexuality in the time of the fall of the military junta (\\"The Story of the night\\")<br />* Henry James in his middle years (\\"The Master\\")<br />* an IRA gunman turned art thief (\\"Mothers and Sons\\")<br />* an Irish high court judge (\\"The Heather Blazing\\")<br />* and, most recently, Eilis Lacey, the stunningly ordinary, but completely unforgettable, heroine of \\"Brooklyn\\", this latest novel.<br /><br />Where does Toibin's particular genius lie? Well, there's the writing, of course. Which is remarkable for being so completely unremarkable. If that seems like a backhanded compliment, let me assure you that it is meant as quite the reverse. I think it takes a phenomenal talent (and a certain gutsy confidence in one's own talent, which the author most definitely has, and just as definitely has earned) to write as unobtrusively as Toibin does. Nothing in his style draws attention to himself as author. Instead, time after time, he finds the right voice, so that the writing flows in a completely natural way, without a word in the wrong place.<br /><br />How does he do this? The answer brings us close to the scary heart of his genius, I think. It's because Toibin lets his characters take over in a way that few other authors manage to do. He becomes them, he channels them. To say they are \\"fully realized\\", \\"deftly drawn\\", that they \\"come to life on the page\\" - whatever reviewer's clich&eacute; comes to mind - doesn't even begin to do him justice. Empathy is surely one of the qualities we expect from any great novelist, and Toibin does empathy like no other modern writer I know. I find his ability to inhabit his characters both fascinating and scary. It scares me because it so exceeds my own powers of imagination.<br /><br />But it's one of the reasons I prefer fiction to non-fiction - if only vicariously, I find that truly good fiction has the power to take me out of myself, and to stretch my capacity for empathy, even if it's only briefly. In his novels, Colm Toibin does this over and over again. I imagine it as being a wholly draining experience for him. But as a reader, my admiration for him is boundless.<br /><br />Of all of Toibin's novels, this one resonated with me the most, presumably because of my identification with the main protagonist as an immigrant to the U.S.<br />Mild spoiler alert: For the final 30 pages, as Eilis has to choose between two radically different possible futures, my heart was in my mouth. The denouement was such a relief. I could certainly identify with her feeling trapped between both worlds.<br /><br />I think the power of \\"Brooklyn\\" is sufficient that it will be affecting for anyone who reads it, not just those who have gone through the whole displacement that accompanies the Irish immigrant experience.<br /><br />If there is any justice at all in this world, this book simply has to win this year's Booker prize*.<br /><br />Read it. Read all of Toibin's books. And see if you don't agree with me.<br /><br /> *: \\"Brooklyn\\" has been `long-listed', I am happy to report.scary.

B000ZEE3I6|1.0|I´m a big Harry Potter fan. I´ve read all the books at least 3 times, and watched all the movies just as many. This movie is the most disappointing of the lot for several reasons.    Writing: The writers of this movie should be fired. They make up the beginning of the movie, when Dumbledore pick up Harry; they include quidditch again( what´s the point); they make up a sequence where the Burrow is destroyed, but DON´T include important things like the will of Sirius Black, Harry hiding the book, Dumbledore telling Harry what he believes the Horcruxes are( and obviously the memories where these objects are shown), the fight against the death eaters in Hogwarts and the funeral. The story is just incomplete in this movie, even more so than in the Order of the Phoenix, because what they left out in this one are so crucial to the storyline.    Editing: The movie has no flow whatsoever. They jump from one scene to another in fast pace with no transitions, without bothering to properly end one scene before another starts. It makes for a not very enjoyable movie.     Acting: The three main actors make Steven Seagal look like an Oscar winner. Other characters, like Lavender Brown or Ginny are just as poor. The adult actors are better, but still not as good as they would be with more talented youth.     There are some scenes that are good, though. Katie being cursed and Dumbledore fighting off the Inferi are the two most memorable ones, but they just don´t make up for the poor writing, editing an acting in the movie.
B0028K31CE|5.0|After seven long years, Maxwell has returned back to us (true R&B music lovers)!<br /><br />Pretty Wings, is a beautiful song that describes the highs and lows of love.  We all can relate.  We all in some part of our lives have meet the \\"one\\", but regrettably wasn't the right time or felt that you could do better with the end result:  wanting it back.  Preach it, Max!<br /><br />Bad habits, well what else can you say.  Beautiful and lustful reminds me of a Marvin Gaye joint.  A joint that makes you want to break out with dance moves that will either get you \\"IN TROUBLE\\" or have you wake up in pain because you know you weren't able to do that in the first place.  Either way, the horns, the drums and the guitar with the addition to Maxwell's voice equals a beautiful jam!<br /><br />Other tracks are great, but for those who are used to Embrya, Now and Urban Suite, you will need to LISTEN to get it. That's it; he makes you LISTEN to the lyrics besides focusing on the background music.  What a concept!<br /><br />Oh yes, the complaint, \\"it only has 9 songs.\\"  Well, it may only have 9 songs, but they all sing something with meaning.  Again, what a concept! This seems to be a theme that is lacking in today's music.  Don't get me wrong.  The beats in today's music are hot, but when you are a home listening to the tracks, you can't believe what is actually being said.  WOW!<br /><br />I love it and I hope you all will give it a try. I can't wait for the remaining two albums in his trilogy.<br /><br />Welcome back, Maxwell.  You were missed!<br /><br />MFF
B001AVCFJM|1.0|After starring in \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\", Sean Connery vowed he would never star in another James Bond film.<br /><br />Then another production company got the rights to make their own Bond film, following some of the monkey business involving \\"Thunderball\\", and Connery was signed to reprise the role of Agent 007.<br /><br />It was Connery's wife who suggested the title, \\"Never Say Never Again\\".<br /><br />Well, I vowed I would never see the new Star Trek movie, partly because I have no interest in alternate timeline stories, but mostly because of a lot of the misleading buildup to this thing and some of the behind the scenes crap, particularly the firing of Geoffery Mandel from the production staff because he was \\"too attached to the original ship.\\"<br /><br />Then, I wound up winning passes to a press screening.<br /><br />No problem, I have class that night, so I can't go anyway. And we're talking broadcasting school, no way am I ditching training in my beloved chosen career field for this misbegotten flick.<br /><br />Then I found out the subject that night was going to be sales.<br /><br />I hate sales.<br /><br />Guess I was going after all. At least I could rest easy that I can still say that I'll never pay to see this atrocity.<br /><br />So, I went ahead and saw it at the press screening, and all I can say is that I'm oh, so glad that I didn't have to pay for it.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that I was massively underwhelmed. Plot contrivances, shaky camera, even in the CGI stuff, cringe inducing dialogue, a \\"Look at MEEE!\\" glory shot of the ship every five minutes, all capped off with a closing credit sequence ripped off from the Lost in Space movie....well, let's just say that just about everything I said before I saw it, stands.<br /><br />Some of the more minor annoyances:<br /><br />Pink skinned Vulcans: Y'know, JJ, there was a reason they painted Nimoy yellow way back when, and it's because of that green Vulcan blood.<br /><br />The Kelvin: 800 people made it off, after getting the crap kicked out it, which killed how many? And this is supposed to be a pre-TOS ship? Sorry, but that bucket reeked more of TNG, both in capacity, the instrumentation, and in the crew complement, which apparently included families, another TNG contrivance that didn't make it past \\"Generations\\" (the Enterprise-E doesn't have families on board). The interiors also indicated a much more massive ship, on the order of a Galaxy class starship. And what in the hell is with plastic sheeting in the shuttlecraft? Does it double as a meat locker?<br /><br />The technology: Compared to TOS, most it, quite frankly, sucked. The numbskull front window/viewscreen was blurry and distorted, the transporter didn't work half as well as even the NX-01's, and the phasers, both shipboard and handheld, all behaved more like Star Wars blasters and turbolasers than their TOS predecessors. And need I mention Sulu's automatically unfolding katana, which helped him in his dashing impression of Luke Skywalker in the barge scene in \\"Return of the Jedi\\"? Or how the ships going to warp bore an uncanny resemblence to SW ships going to hyperspace? Should George Lucas be flattered or should he be calling his lawyers?<br /><br />Delta Vega: As an astute poster over on [...] pointed out, the name of the neighboring planet that Spock was stranded on really didn't have any bearing on the story, but by invoking the name of Delta Vega, the writers shined a big bright spotlight on this bit, making it quite clear that, deep down, they don't know what they're doing. A big part of \\"honoring canon\\" is getting the details right; otherwise, it's just meaningless name dropping and pandering.<br /><br />Chekov: Excuse me, but exactly when did Chekov turn into Wesley Crusher? He was never any kind of wunderkind in TOS, just an eager young ensign trying to impress his superior officers. Also, at age seventeen, he should be starting his first year at the Academy, not already be a commissioned officer. But then, these clowns clearly don't know a thing about military protocol, since they also take a guy who was an undisciplined cadet facing some serious charges a couple of days earlier and give him command of their biggest and most advanced ship. Never mind the hundreds of seasoned officers who've been waiting God knows how long for a command of their own, let's give it to the hotshot kid with the rap sheet, because he's just so gosh darned dreamy. At the very least, it's clear they wouldn't know the chain of command if someone came up and beat 'em about the head and shoulders with it.<br /><br />And my complaint about Spock still remains: He knows how to achieve a time warp, and he knows precisely what happened when, why it happened, what went wrong the first time, and how to circumvent those events. So why doesn't he get a ship, do a few time jumps, and fix everything that got screwed up? He could not only restore the timeline, but finally cement a lasting peace between the Romulan Empire and the Federation. So why doesn't he do this?<br /><br />Because Spock has to have a sudden attack of the stupids in order for JJ to get his own Star Trek universe to run amok in.<br /><br />Urban was good as McCoy, Pine was okay as Kirk, can't really grade Greenwood as Pike since we never got that much from Jeffery Hunter to form a basis of comparison, but taken on it's own, he gives a good performance, Yelchin was downright embarrassing as Chekov, Quinto just seemed to be PMSing all the time, and the rest of the cast was just sort of there.<br /><br />The ship still looks stupid, and the decision to build it on the surface is the singlemost idiotic move in the entire history of the franchise.<br /><br />It didn't help that the \\"Riverside shipyards\\" were clearly a present day industrial facility, either an oil refinery or electrical substation. Engineering looking alternately like a water treatment plant and, like it is in real life, a brewery, only adds insult to injury.<br /><br />If this an example of just how dumbed down Star Trek has to be in order to appeal to that elusive mass general audience, then I am very content for Star Trek to remain a small niche market.undisciplined cadet facing some serious charges a couple of days earlier and give him command of their biggest and most advanced ship.

0446402397|4.0|Children in 1950's Russia are being murdered by a single killer.  The state will not acknowledge such a crime even possible so a lone investigator, goes after the killer alone, while he himself is being persecuted for political crimes.  What makes it far fetched is how the author personally ties the killer to the investigator, which is also used as the main explanation for the killer's motivation.  Still a fun read, but the end is just unrealistic.
B000002KDO|5.0|If you like really raw hard rock, then Black Sabbath's Master Of Reality is for you.  The sound is very raw and crunchy.  It's not crystal clear.  Sometimes albums like this with this kind of sound are better than the well-produced crystal clear ones because they offer what is most important when it comes to hard rock - the attitude.  The riffs and melodies are there no matter how clear or muffled they are.  That's the most important thing.  They're there.  This music will get stuck in your head.  That's all that matters.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Sweet Leaf\\" and its classic coughing in the beginning.  The next track is \\"After Forever\\" with its awesome guitar riff provided by the great southpaw guitarist Tony Iommi.  \\"Embryo\\" is a short guitar solo, if you will.  The next song, \\"Children Of The Grave\\", has an outstanding guitar riff and is very melodic.  I always play this song during the Halloween season because its one of the must-play songs.  It ends with the haunting sounds of ghosts.  Very creepy.  \\"Orchid\\" follows, a mellow guitar song.  \\"Lord Of This World\\" rocks with another great guitar riff.  Definitely one of the best songs on the album.  \\"Into The Void\\" provides yet another great guitar riff.  \\"Solitude\\" is the last song and is very mellow and mystical.<br /><br />If you like rawness and purity to your hard rock, then this album will satisfy you.  One of the great Black Sabbath albums.  It will rock you.

Definitely an excellent movie especially if it inspires you to sweep your home for \\"bugs\\" and scramble all your phone connections. The price of freedom is truly eternal vigilance.

B001BLSEN2|5.0|Nothing beats the original lineup of Kiss - Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss.  Sure, their future lineups were good and produced a lot of good songs all the while improving their sound, but nothing beats an original.  This collection contains 20 songs that are the Kiss that I remember.  The set begins with one of my favorite Kiss songs, Strutter '78.  I like Frehley's guitar playing on this song.  Do You Love Me? has heavy guitar and great lyrics.  I think Calling Dr. Love was a very influential song for other bands to emulate, not so much musically, but concept-wise.  God Of Thunder and Deuce have Gene Simmons singing and are two of their more popular tunes.  Detroit Rock City just plain rocks, as does Rock And Roll All Nite.  The ballad Beth was the band's only #1 hit, sung by Peter Criss.  That seems to happen so often with hard rock bands - they make a ballad and it turns into a #1 hit, or a big hit generally speaking.  Good examples are More Than Words by Extreme, Open Arms by Journey, Every Rose Has Its Thorn by Poison, and Home Sweet Home By Motley Crue.  I can go on and on, but I'll spare you.  Cold Gin is another song sung by Gene Simmons and is one of their more popular songs.  It was written by Ace Frehley.  Track 20, Black Diamond, rocks.<br /><br />One of the things I like about Kiss is they are one of those rare groups that has all band members singing songs as the lead singer, rather than just having one singer singing all the songs.  Another group that does this is Blue Oyster Cult.<br /><br />If you want to get into Kiss and their original lineup, then this is really all you need.  A good collection of songs.  Highly recommended.
B001SAO38Q|5.0|I ripped the shrink-wrap off this little gem this morning with the glee of a six-year old delinquent given a day pass to a Cadburys candy factory. I then sat down to watch it and emerged two hours later with the grin of a 51-year old Cheshire cat on Viagra.<br /><br />We all know \\"The Italian Job\\" is a Sixties classic, but what you don't know is that this 40th Anniversary reissue of it (issued 15 June 2009 in the UK) is simply off the charts good...<br /><br />First up is the print - which is GLORIOUS - as pristine as you could hope for and a joy from start to finish. And although it doesn't state it on the outer box, this is the fully restored British Film Institute version, which has been cleaned up frame-by-frame (and those clean shots are used in the \\"Making Of\\" extras too). One of those features is the 30th Anniversary reissue trailer from 10 years ago, which uses the famous \\"...doors off...\\" van sequence. Untouched - it's covered in scratches and has no definition whatsoever - it allows you see what the film stock did look like as opposed to how beautiful it looks now after restoration.<br /><br />There are so many scenes that now stand out - as Matt Monro's cheesy song \\"On Days Like These\\" plays and the car drives through the Alps in the opening credits - when Charlie comes out of prison as he walks through the gates and Maggie Blye greets him in a stolen car from the Pakistani Embassy - when the three Mini Coopers climb the roof of the football stadium with the Italian cops in pursuit - it's just all BEAUTIFUL. The BFI have also done \\"Zulu\\", \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" and \\"Saturday Night And Sunday Morning\\" and this is up to the same stunning standard as they are (see my reviews).<br /><br />The extras are generous too (nearly two hours worth):<br />1. Commentary with Screenwriter Tony Kennedy Martin and Author Matthew Field<br />2. Commentary by Producers Michael Deeley and Author Matthew Field<br />3. Mini Adventures (in HD)<br />4. \\"Self Preservation Society: The Making Off The Italian Job\\" (in HD) - features new interviews with the cast, writers, producers including Michel Caine, Maggie Blye, Troy Kennedy Martin, Michael Deeley, reminiscences on Noel Coward, the Director Peter Collinson, Quincy Jones on the cool score etc...<br />5. Music Video (in HD)<br />6. The Deleted Scene With Commentary by Author Matthew Field<br />7. Theatrical Trailer<br />8. Re-release Trailer<br /><br />The casting of course was a mixture of luck, fate and genius - Caine perfect as Charlie Croker the likely lad, Benny Hill as the groping computer boffin, the suave yet deadly Raf Vallone as the Turin Mafia boss and Tony Beckley as the dandily dressed Camp Freddy. But the biggest coup of all was Noel Coward as Mr. Bridger - the master-criminal doing time in her Majesty's prison service. He has tea and scones, worries about the British economy and has his cell plastered with pictures of the Queen. Coward is just priceless as he lords about the decking of the prison block, \\"Rule Britannia\\" played behind him by a string quartet - it's enough to make you howl with laughter...<br /><br />You see you forget how funny The Italian Job is - the catty gay tailor saying Charlie's pre-prison clothes could now be part of a museum exhibit, Coward standing beside two prison guards as they hand him his two newspapers and a toilet roll. Prison Governor John Le Mesurier's look of astonishment as Coward complains that `his' toilet has been invaded by Michael Caine (pitching the heist to him) - a man's toilet is his castle... The snooty garage manager played beautifully by John Clive counting the money Michael Caine has just given him for looking after his Aston Martin DB - it's been in his garage for two years while Caine was away in `India'. \\"I was shooting tigers old boy...\\" Garage owner counting the fifties, \\" ...there must have been an awful lot of tigers sir...\\"<br /><br />The Turin locations are wonderfully colourful, the mountain scenes as crisp as those in the James Bond reissues and Caine's freckles clearer than ever - all of it - what a peach!<br /><br />I've reviewed a lot of oldies on the new BLU RAY format of late - some successful, some woeful - but this is up there with the very best. In fact, as a man who adores the medium and believes in its possibilities, I suspect it'll tickle Michael Caine pink that his films \\"Zulu\\" and \\"The Italian Job\\" are both going a long way towards establishing BLU RAY as `the' format to restore old movies to and preserve them properly. Onwards to David Lean boys...<br /><br />As you can tell - and if you'll forgive the pun - I was blown away.<br /><br />Loved it, loved it, loved it. Recommended - big time.ever - all of it - what a peach!    I've reviewed a lot of oldies on the new BLU RAY format of late - some successful, some woeful - but this is up there with the very best.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This movie could have been a mess. Fortuneately, no missteps were made in bringing this epic graphic novel to life. This movie was made for people familiar with the novel, so read the novel first (I read the original 12-issue series) if you have'nt already. This is a great movie - alot of stuff is going on at multiple levels in this movie.    Yes, its a movie about superheroes, but it asks the question \\"what if they were real people\\". The human condition is thoroughly examined here with style. One particular theme, in the book, which is in the movie and is very important, is the conflict between the two main characters: Dr. Manhattan and Ozymandias - the god who thought he was a man and the man who thought he was a god. Great stuff.    Nothing was half-done in this movie. The cinematography, the acting and the attention to detail all make watching the Watchmen a wonderful movie experience.

B000003FMY|5.0|Performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Fritz Reiner, Mussorgsky's classical favorite \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" is a lively, florid masterpiece.  Originally composed as a suite of ten movements for piano based on the watercolors and drawings of friend Viktor Hartmann from his travels abroad, \\"Pictures\\" has been arranged for and performed by orchestras many times over, the best arrangement being that by Mussorgsky friend and fellow composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.  Although the included \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" by Mussorgsky is orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov, I believe this version of \\"Pictures\\" is orchestrated by Maurice Ravel.  Other Russian favorites are included for a great compilation.  While this is but one of many good interpretations of \\"Pictures\\" as an orchestral piece, at Amazon's present price of $7.98, a better bargian can't be had, unless you buy a few other classical music favorites that are similarly priced at Amazon and receive free shipping in the deal as well.
0802798225|5.0|I picked this book up, and was apprehensive of reading it. When I picked up this book I was automatically hooked. \\"Perfect Chemistry\\" is about two unlikely teens that fall in love. Brittany is a rich teen that lives in Chicago, and works really hard to keep up a perfect image, and Alex is apart of a gang called the Latino Bloods and works really hard to keep up his tough image. When they begin to fall for each other everything else seems to fall apart. I'm a big sucker for romances, and usually the books I read have the same story line, but this book was amazingly written. The way that Alex and Brittany's relationship grows throughout the book makes your heart swell, and all the troubles that Alex & Brittany go through both together and apart makes your heart ache. It keeps you interested cover to cover and makes you wish that there was more! I defiantly recommend this book to everyone who likes a good romantic drama.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I agree with the majority of the positive reviews here.  In fact I would probably give the 405CX five stars if I owned a PC, but I don't.  The device is great as a device and does what it advertises, but if you own a Mac, stay away.  I immediately had problems getting the watch to upload its data to the Mac when I got the device three months ago.  It would try repeatedly and eventually succeed. Then I installed their upgrade and now it is useless.  It has been trying to upload its data for almost a week without success.  Three e-mails to Garmin on this have yielded zero responses.    They do not post old software versions so reloading the old version is not an option.     I am convinced that they just do not know how to write software and it really shows -no logging of failures, hence no way to diagnose why it won't upload, no feedback mechanism so that failures can be tracked by Garmin in order to improve their software, feature poor interface, etc.  Add to this that their web site support requires you to re-enter all of your data even though you are logged in and they have your product information.  Garmin may understand GPS, but they don;t get software and they are a long way from understanding what a 21st century web experience should be.      I could sing the praises of the watch's functionality and ergonomics, but what is the point?  Without being able to upload your training history, I might as well use a cheap Timex and Google maps to track my training.  Find another solution if you own a Mac.
0385340567|1.0|MY question is Chapter 1 of this book HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE STORY?? Or if it does, I dont see the connection?? Lee Child never ties the rest of the story back to why he is in the sand possibly dying??    I only read the first few pages of the newest book, Gone Tomorrow, and there is no reference.. Can someone please tell me what the purpose of chapter 1 in Nothing to Lose was?    It was quite a disappointment after reading all of the others.. I would say skip this one...    Like most people, I had read all of the Reacher books up to this one and LOVED THEM!!  The Enemy is the BEST BOOK of the series.. Really helped me understand who JR is by seeing his brother, his mother etc. 2nd best is Without Fail.    thanks in advance for the explanation.
B00140PK6O|5.0|The Brits really know how to produce top-level entertainment.  Cranford is magical and I was saddened when it finished.  Wish there were more installments.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Don't buy the regular CD it will leave you wanting. So much has been cut in the original movie that it looses it's continuity. The directors cut is 100% better and ties the whole story together.
B0025T65GC|5.0|Being an SYL fan and recognizing Townsend's abilities, I was excited to buy this album. I was disappointed at first. What the heck?.. I thought. But I kept giving it a listen, and song by song I was able to digest and eventually discover its power and beauty. Eventually I actually started humming a lot of the songs to myself throughout the day, after many listens, and I never would have predicted that to be the case after my first listen. If you want a catchy album, dont buy this one. I couldnt handle more than one song every 2-3 days from it. Each song requires you to be in a very specific mood to take it in. The album is a little spread over the map, and start-to-finish listens of the entire album dont really work. That is probably my only complaint. But thats ok - this is now one of the most important albums in my collection. Devin - cant wait to catch you on tour!
B000000OXH|3.0|I had doubts about purchasing this album based on other reviews.  I recently saw them in concert and decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.  It isn't as good an album as their first self-titled album, Asia, which truly was their alpha album, but it isn't a bad follow-up.  Really, how could they top their monstrously successful first album?!  I would have given it 4 stars, but the recording isn't top-notch.  I had to to some tweaking in i-tunes to even get any volume out of it.<br /><br />P.S.  Steve Howe is in his 70's and still plays guitar better than many guitarists today.  I was amazed with his skills in their recent Phoenix tour!!!
B002FLO0MG|5.0|To this day I think this is a great movie. I love the special effects. For its day this was amazing. I still pull this movie out and watch it on a Sunday afternoon. It is one of my all time favorite movies.   I think one of my favorate parts is when James Spader is walking through the Stargate for the first time and he touches, what looks like water. It ripples then with courage he closes his eyes and puts his face in. The was they did this shot and the way Spader  performed it. It made me feel like I was doing it with him. I guess someday I hope to travel a wormhole or maybe just ride a shuttle to space. Anyway I loved the ride Stargate gave me.  I am sorry I am not so critical of the movie as others. I just look at movies as an escape and adventure. There is enough problems in the world and we could use a little more adventure and love and joy the things that movies give us to ease the life we live.    GO AND ENJOY A MOVIE OF YOUR CHOISING DO NOT LET THE CRITICS TELL YOU THAT A MOVIE IS GOOD OR BAD MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND!  This is what I do and I have seen some of the best movies (what I consider) no matter what the critics say. Besides if sales are in the $700 million dollar range how can that many people be wrong. even though the critics only give it 2 stars.   I hope this helps. Go out and live life watch a favorite movie with someone you love.
B000065U1N|5.0|This film came as quite a surprise to me. I had expected another quickly thrown together Hollywood exploitation film that capitalizes on a recent tragedy. But instead, this is a magnificently produced war film that features the most grueling and visceral battle scenes since the original All Quiet on the Western Front brought the reality of World War I home to the general public (Saving Private Ryan came close, though). More important, thanks to our lousy American news media, I had always thought that the entire event depicted here consisted of nothing more than a \\"peacekeeping\\" helicopter being shot down, and Somalians disrespecting a dead American soldier's body. Instead, it turned out to be and 18+ hour ordeal in which a hundred or so American special forces were pinned down in an urban setting by perhaps ten thousand or more armed Somali militia.    What this film does well is to portray the sheer ordeal that these soldiers went through, and to evoke a lot of respect for the way they conducted themselves in a truly desperate situation. The exposition contains a fair amount of foreshadowing of what's to come, yet when the mission finally does turn sour there is no way to miss the contrast between what these soldiers expected, and what they got. They expected a quick in-and-out mission that would take 30 minutes. They ended up with the longest and most desperate fire fight that American soldiers had experienced since the Vietnam War. If you're thinking about things while watching this film, Garrison explained the entire situation succinctly: \\"We've lost the initiative.\\"    The battle scenes themselves must be seen to be believed. I was so immersed in them that when I had to interrupt the film for a tornado warning at home, it took me a moment to bring myself \\"back\\" from Mogadishu. That's effective storytelling.    Someone in the \\"making of\\" documentary summarized what this film is about perfectly, when they said in the thick of battle the two things that keep you alive is your training, and your comrades. One of the greatest paradoxes of humanity is that war is a manifestation of our very worst nature as a species, yet individual soldier's responses to war often exhibit our very best qualities and virtues. You really get a sense of that in this film as men who appear to be somewhat arrogant and irresponsible in their daily lives, suddenly band together and focus as an effective team to ensure their mutual survival.    The best example of their commitment to each other came when two Delta Force snipers (who won the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously) asked to be inserted into a hopeless situation just to protect their wounded comrades until reinforcements could arrive. It's a shame that our politicians couldn't conjure up that kind of a focused response to Hurricane Katrina, and that our corporate executives couldn't exhibit that kind of selfless behavior as a devastating economic crisis loomed. How can a congressman or corporate CEO possibly \\"earn\\" more money than these soldiers do? These soldiers were soaked in their comrades blood, and guns were pointed at them from every direction, constantly. Yet Hillary Clinton cries a river whenever someone smokes a cigarette near her, Donald Trump becomes furious when his interns make a mistake with his corporate lemonade stand, and people actually continue to listen to people like Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck when they suffer meltdowns just because someone else SAID something they don't want to hear. Meanwhile, critics complain about the violence in this film, as if we'll somehow be more productive if we wear rose-colored blinders when viewing the reality of warfare.    If you don't like realistic depictions of violence in film, don't be a coward who tries to stop films from depicting it. Be courageous, and stop the violence, instead. Trying to stop filmmakers from depicting what life is really like, is reprehensible. Kudos to Ridley Scott for keeping it real.    My God, if nothing else, Black Hawk Down shows us how our lack of sensible priorities are going to destroy America, rather than us being conquered by another nation. I trust these soldiers to defend us against invasion from a foreign army. But who will defend us against the sniveling weasels that run our government, our media, and our corporations? Unfortunately, Black Hawk Down only makes vague allusions to the political intrigue that resulted in this catastrophe that killed 19 men (not to mention the Clinton Administration's response). And like a good soldier, Major General William F. Garrison accepted full responsibility, to take the heat off of his utterly irresponsible Commander in Chief.    The film begins much like a typical Irwin Allen disaster film from the 1970's, with a lot of rapid exposition to establish the characters and the setting. This is necessary with so many speaking characters--especially when they all look alike in uniform! My greatest concern is that we have no way to know for certain how accurate these portrayals really are. I would like to have seen an interview with at least one participant in the actual battle in the special features, who could explain which parts of the film were realistic, and which parts were created by artistic license. After all, this film is \\"based on an actual event\\", which in Hollywoodspeak means that nearly the entire story presented here might be fiction.    However, the filmmakers did consult many of the men who took part in the actual battle, so it is probably accurate overall. Those real soldiers made it clear that they wanted this film to honor those who had fallen. I can say, for me at least, that they succeeded. I am always against any kind of war, except for defense against invasion, and I have little respect for the military as an institution that wastes as much as half of our national budget while millions of Americans continue to live in poverty. Yet there is no denying that if we are going to send these men and women into battle, regardless of the reason, they deserve our respect and our support, and we should learn from the example of how they conduct themselves under duress. Black Hawk Down certainly promotes that idea well.    But above all else, remember everything that these men endured, when their ultimate goal was simply to see that starving people got fed, especially in a nation where cities like Las Vegas make it illegal to feed the homeless in public places. If you're courageous enough to THINK beyond the particular story being told here, this film has many important things to say to us.

B001993Y2C|1.0|I was all set to buy the Battlestar Galactica: Complete Series Blu-Ray release, even though the thing is so expensive I was practically going to have to take out a second mortgage on my house to afford it. But for whatever reason, Universal has chosen not to include the Face of the Enemy webisodes on the Blu-Ray or DVD releases of Battlestar Galactica: Series 4.5 or Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series. Since I want a complete story, not just the parts Universal arbitrarily feels like sharing at the moment, I no longer intend to purchase the set. While this turn of events is actually to my financial advantage, I am disappointed nonetheless, as I was really looking forward to owning this show on Blu-Ray.    I know some would argue that the webisodes are still available online and I can watch them there. While that's true, why should I have to pay hundreds of dollars for a high-def Blu-Ray product that I'm going to watch on a large, flat-screen TV only to have to watch what is a (to some more than others) critical part of the story via a low-def YouTube clip on a tiny computer monitor? That seems to sort of miss the mark...    And to those who would say that the webisodes were not part of the series and therefore Universal isn't required to include them in a Complete Series release, you are technically correct; Universal can still slide by with calling this a \\"Complete Series\\" without the webisodes, since it includes every episode of the TV series proper. But that doesn't make it a complete story, which is what I'm looking for. Note that a few years ago, when Twin Peaks: Season 1 was released without the pilot movie (which was unavailable due to some really bizarre international licensing issues and not technically part of the first season), the set's packaging and promo materials were up-front about the pilot's absence; Universal has made no such concession, as they clearly want folks to be suckered into buying this without knowing that they are missing what equates to about a full episode's worth of story and some rather critical information about a character (particularly as it relates to actions that character takes later in the series, which some argue seem a bit out-of-character without the context of the webisodes).    So, Universal, thanks for saving me all that money, but maybe next time, instead of using so much of your own money to come up with that ridiculous disc packaging that so many people on here seem to despise, you'll put some of it towards overcoming whatever (I'm guessing) minor obstacles arose that precluded from including the webisodes and giving fans a complete story.    Just sayin'.     (P.S. I've heard rumblings that Universal plans to make the Face of the Enemy webisodes avaible via another means. I remain skeptical since the correct time for them to release this part of the story was with the Complete Series and 4.5 sets, and they've given no concrete evidence that they are really going to do this; if they were too lazy to do it when people were paying hundreds of dollars for a Complete Series set release, why would they do it for anything else? However, if Universal really does find a way to provide those who purchased these sets with Blu-Ray copies of the webisodes, I may change my opinion.)
B001VOD5CE|5.0|As with the LED ZEPPELIN / studio album Shm-CDs , these RUSH studio album Shm-CDs / look and sound fantastic!!!     1. You receive perfect studio album reproductions. CD size.     2. ALL of these RUSH / SHM-CDs have fully coloured album covers printed right on the CDs themselves. These are not just the boring silver CDs from the 1997 re-masters.     3. If you liked the 2008 MOFI version of P. WAVES and wanted more RUSH CDs that sounded like those , here you have them.     Clear , clean with 0 harshness. Just a little more volume [but not too much].     You will hear more base , vocals , drums and keyboards.     Songs like CYGNUS X-1 , are just mind blowing.   The highs and lows are stunning.     I will not even talk about , XANADU. WOW!!!     If you have ever heard the SHM-CDs of their 2 RETROSPECTIVE / CDs , the studio albums sound just as good.     These RUSH studio Shm-CDs are the best RUSH that I have ever heard. Like with most SHM-CDs they sound best on stereos with more than 2 speakers!!!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Purists may not like this version and I too am a lover of the classic version. But.....  Directed by Joe Wright and screenwritten by Deborah Moggach, this is the most visually arresting and artistic of the \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" films.  The strength of the other versions has always been the dialogue. This is the first version which trusts the camera and imagery and lets the luminosity of the story line shine through rather than talking straight through it. The actors in this version are also a who's who of British acting. There is the young and impudent incandesence of Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet. She is the prejudiced one against the wealth and position of the young man who initially finds her too inferior to even be his dance partner.  This is Mr. Darcy as played by Matthew Macfadyen.  I was used to him as the head spy on MI-5 so he is maybe the last actor I would have cast as Darcy. However, I didn't realize how versatile an actor he is.  He is fabulous as Darcy, the one who suffers from pride in his origins, his convictions, his family and his property.  Elizabeth is beneath him so how could he fall in love with her?  This is the best story for answering that question with \\"how indeed!\\" Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench play Mrs. Bennett and Lady Catherine.  Acting doesn't get any better than this.

1593974744|5.0|Ender Wiggins is sent away to military school at a very early age.  He is among other special recruits who are also the only hope for the planet to survive the next war against the aliens.  Ender was picked over his siblings by the school despite his also having very talented siblings.  Ender is a little boy who should be in early elementary school. This makes it all the more astounding that he engages in daily warfare with his classmates, all of the same age, while also tackling massive academic challenges.  Meanwhile his siblings become secret journalists writing for opposite political sides, with one another's knowledge and cooperation, to make their marks on the planet.  The story builds towards the inevitable showdown with the aliens.  This is beautifully narrated by more than one narrator.  I enjoyed the audiobook immensely.  There is not an extra word in this novel.  This is so refreshing as so many of the newer books seem to lack a real good editing job.  I could see Stephen Spielberg filming this, much like his AI film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00260HH3K|5.0|Dragonball Z was overall entertaining. This movie was obviously meant to impress upon a young audience (that would be younger kids). Looks like the only people who did not enjoy it are the older adult Dragonball Z fans who still wake up on Saturday morning & watch cartoons. Seems the movie fell so short of their high expectations they all decided to team up via other websites to come here and give it negative 1 star reviews. How pathetic is that??
B00005V1Y0|5.0|(Five stars for the film, three for the DVD quality). I first watched this movie in the 1990s (taped from Bravo) and loved this movie so much that I watched it eight times in one week. Every time I see this film, it makes me very happy. It's a light-hearted fable about letting go of fear, living your own path regardless of what others think. To be honest, I think it's the best of his \\"red curtain trilogy\\" (Romeo and Juliet and Mulan Rouge).     Although the storyline is fantastic, the DVD is lacking. There are no extras. It would helped had there been an interview with Baz Luhrman about this movie, or with  members of the cast, etc;. The only \\"extras\\" are the \\"sneak peeks\\" at the studio's new films. Blah. Also, I think that the picture and sound quality need to be remastered.
0307237699|3.0|The Audcaity of Hope is an eloquently written book that would seem to allow a glance into the soul of the man who is now the American president. Unfortunately, that feel of what the book should be is lost in how the book does feel. While reading through the pages, one can't help but notice the disconcerting nobility and righteousness of all Obama says. It feels like the words have been meticulously selected, and surely they have, to make the man unerringly likeable. The arguments are constructed so well that to disagree would be to admit to oneself of being a bad person. Unfortunately, someone like Obama who takes such morally correct stances on everything seems implausible to the reader. No one is perfect.    And so the entire content of this book is its own greatest merit and demerit. Each argument and hot topic is described so reasonably, so objectively and is so well balanced that one cannot help but hate the man who wrote it, either for being a liar or for being too perfect.
9562916464|2.0|The original edition is not typeset, and that makes it very distracting. You can tell which typewriter was used to do original and edited pages. The letters wave up and down, for instance, 'c's are low, and 'u's are high on some pages.<br /><br />I highly recommend getting a typeset edition, if one is available.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|It's obvious from reading the wide variety of opinions on this CD that the musical selections on \\"Genius Loves Company\\", like music itself, move people in many different directions.  \\"Different directions\\" is probably a good way to describe this compilation of duets with a variety of artists produced during the twilight of Ray's great life and career.  \\"Genius Loves Company\\", in a way, represents a microcosm of Ray's career in that there are plenty of R&B, soul, and pop tunes in this album.  While heavy on orchestration, this CD does showcase a cavalcade of great performers including Elton John, Michael McDonald, James Taylor, Gladys Knight, Natalie Cole, BB King, and Johnny Mathis.  Ray shares the stage well with these performers and allows them to have their moments to shine on the album.<br /><br />The idea for this album actually sprang from a live collaboration between Ray and Van Morrison on \\"Crazy Love\\", which is the last selection on the disk.  Though it's obvious that Ray was losing some of his volume and range in this album (he was 73 at the time of most of the recording), he is still in fine form and shines on cuts with Knight (\\"Heaven Help Us All\\"), Cole (\\"Fever\\"), McDonald (\\"Hey Girl\\"), and Bonnie Raitt (\\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?\\").  My favorite cut from the album is Ray's duet with BB King on \\"Sinner's Prayer\\".  It's obvious that the two legends are familiar with with each other and fit together like your favorite pair of leather gloves on this selection.<br /><br />My least favorite cut is the duet with Willie Nelson on \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\".  The song is a musically challenging as it stands and the two men struggle with the range and tempo of the song.  Elton and Ray's rendition of \\"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\\" is less than satisfying, as well.  Be that as it may, there are enough great songs on this CD to please both the casual and dedicated fans of Ray Charles.
B001QTXM5Y|3.0|First, let me say this is *not* a review of the movie.  This is a review of this particular product release of the movie.    The good:  IMHO the extended scenes make the story more clear and make the movie more faithful to the comic series/graphic novel.  I also think it adds to the psychological examination of the characters that makes the story so compelling.  The transfer to DVD looks great.    The bad:  For a two disc set, this is stunningly short on extra features.  There are *no* commentary tracks, and only two featurettes on the second DVD.      Basically, this is a token release now in a cynical attempt to get fans of the movie to buy the DVD twice.  If that's what you want, then fine, but if you're looking for something more and can stand to wait until the boxed set releases scheduled for December or whenever, then I would strongly urge you to pass on this release and wait.
B00006GA48|5.0|CLOSER TO HOME is a great Grand Funk Railroad album that's now even better with warm, crisp, thick remastering. Many of the songs here, including the Top 40 single \\"I'm Your Captain/Closer To Home\\" and \\"Aimless Lady\\", have become standards on such classic rock stations as WPYX, KGON, WCSX, KISM, WQUS, WCMF, WGRF, KZOK, KLPX, KFEG, WPDH, KUFX/KUZX, KQMT, KXPT, KVRV, KOZZ,  and many others. Even lesser known songs such as \\"Sin's A Good Man's Brother\\" sound a clarion call for peace, love, and understanding that even today might inspire a high school boy not to reject an ordinary girl in favor of the cheerleading captain. Moreover, the fact that past and present members have supported recent efforts to free Americans jailed abroad on false charges makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I had this video on VHS but could no longer use it because I didn't have a player, so I ordered it on DVD.  The first time I bought this video was when it first came out over 15 years ago.  I still enjoy this workout because it has a good warm up, strenuous exercises, short breaks for water and shaking it out, and leaves me feeling like I got a great workout.  I alternate this with other workout DVDs during the week but I think this is the all time best all body workout.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|First off, the short story was much better.  This movie-rendering got bogged down in the uninteresting and unemotional love story between Button and what's her name.  Made no sense and dragged horribly.  (Wife went to bed in the middle of it and I fell asleep twice).  Almost comical rendering all in all, and barely, just barely two stars.  And what did the hurricane have to do with anything???????  Hollywood blows it again.
B001U0HBPG|3.0|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Single-Disc Edition) was a three or four star film which my wife talked me into seeing.  The premise of a man growing younger made no sense to me before seeing the movie, and made little sense after. Of course, I liked Brad Pit and Cate Blanchett as well as the other performers, but the story just depressed and confused me.<br /><br />Benjamin is born and is pronounced by the doctor to have little time to live as he has an assortment of diseases which resemble those of advanced age.  He then grows up having all sorts of interesting adventures and romances but after a full life when it is time for him to die he starts to get smaller (note, up until now he has been growing larger but younger... and now he is growing smaller and younger) becoming first a forgetful child, then a small child who forgets how to speak, how to walk and then an infant.  In the final scene when being held in the arms of his one time lover (who has become his caretaker and effectively his mother), he looks into his lovers face as a beautiful infant perhaps remembering who she (and he) were, and goes to sleep, and ultimately dies.  This sequence made no sense and I found it to be really upsetting.  I usually have trouble with the tenses when I write but this story really gave me trouble.<br /><br />If this film suggested some new idea, besides death being only for old people in aged and broken down bodies, I might have felt the news was worth the depressing message.  I didn't need this film to tell me that in an ideal world children in brand new bodies should never die. I feel if a film must depress it should make you feel that you have learned something new or profoundly true about the human condition. This film did not teach such a lesson to me and presented its plot using allegorical or symbolic images which might have been drawn from sci-fi or fantasy. I must have really missed the idea of the film.  I am almost certain the writer had something in mind.
B000J103PC|2.0|The outdated premise that creates the conflict of this film (does Andrea sell out?) is that women should sacrifice their ambition and careers for their men--even boyfriends.  It gives us the idiotic ending despite the fact that the film does nothing to support this idea, and as a result, the viewer's sympathies are fixed early on, and solidly with, Andrea, as we're all whisked along in a cinematic cocoon right through the swirl of the action.  Andrea (Anne Hathaway) is an Ugly Betty who very quickly gets a makeover that creates a gorgeous, cosmeticized platform for couture, which she wears well.  She looks like all the other girls in the room, but she has all the lines, so who cares?  Her boyfriend's script allows only for a five O clock shadow, worn t shirts, pants or boxers and shoes.  He's a gourmet commercial cook, and doesn't make a lot of money as we guess from his complaints about the cost of what he buys from Dean and DeLuca.  Boyfriend just doesn't get it, and we quickly lose interest in him, especially since he does so little to support her career.<br /><br />We're supposed to have more sympathy with the people of her old life, but they're all stick figures, and the movie shows us what Andrea has to go through--she earns every bauble dress she wears.  And then some.  She's not a schemer, she's hardworking, dedicated and principled in a world where the last two are fairly relative, and the hardworking is the minimum expectation.  And then there's Amanda Priestly (Meryl Streep).  Meryl Streep fans would be forgiven for thinking this is a Meryl Streep film, it is not.  Meryl Streep doesn't play a character in the traditional sense, she flits in and out of scenes, in her personal hurricane, smacking most everyone she meets and nearly freezing out all the rest.  Think cameos, a string of cameos.  Well before the end of the film, Streep fans are well aware they're not getting enough Streep, at all.  But, since the viewer is so firmly fixed with Andrea, and her world only briefly (and humanely) intersects with that of Amanda, we have no more opportunity to see or know Amanda Priestly.  My, but isn't she fabulously wicked though!<br /><br />The film climaxes in Paris, and then that ridiculous idea resurfaces in earnest, like a bug that's eating the film, and before you know it, or are ready for it, the film is done, in one of the worst, most inappropriate endings I've seen.  I can't dump on this film as I'd like, because for the most part it's very entertaining.  Even a fashion dolt like me is taken right in, and before long is convinced that with proper couture, we could solve all of the world's problems...Africa!, the Middle East!.  That may well have been the champagne by that point, but the point is, the movie is addictively glamorous, nearly to a fault, and the pace is breathless.  Yet, the way it gives it all up at the end ruins everything.  Watch it with the original \\"The Women\\" to see how badly dated, yet consistent with the past the idea is.  Ah well.  I wouldn't buy it, but might watch at least parts of it again.
B0026OE2O8|5.0|HOME features absolutely breathtaking images of our HOME planet. If you loved Planet Earth, you will enjoy this one as well. Many people have stated that the dire environmental warnings are annoying. However, no matter where you come down on the debate you can still enjoy the breathtaking beauty of this wonderful place we all call home!<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you enjoy watching video that puts you in awe of this amazing place we live called Earth, then you will love HOME and it's amazing images. Yes, some people may be annoyed by the message conveyed, but don't let that take away from the amazing imagery!
1591391105|3.0|I agree with all the reviews that said this book is \\"dry\\" in tone, as I had a hard time staying interested.  From what I got out of it, the book covers a topic known in the corporate world as \\"Change Management,\\" which is simply managing the inevitable changes that come with any job, project, or major undertaking.  They specifically talk about what to expect/do when you have just started a new position with a new company. It's a combination of leadership training, team training, management, and strategic planning.    I hope they come out with a \\"Cliff's notes\\" version of this.  This book could be boiled down into about 10 pages of useful info. The rest is just fluff.
0762434279|4.0|This abridged version is a great (and quick) way to get the advice of Rich Dad, Poor Dad.  This is a good mindset book that will get you thinking about the way you earn, save, and invest money.  Some of the stories seem fake to me, just to give you a lesson in investing (or whatever the topic is).  However, that doesn't mean that the lesson isn't important.    Read it, take what you like, leave what you don't like.  Good stuff and a real bargain for the price!!
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|This item was a gift for my niece, 900 miles away.  I haven't heard of any complaints from my sister.  Shipped fast.  Thank you!
B001UV4XL0|4.0|The first thing that stands out about A Perfect Getaway (other than the bad choice of name for a horror movie) is the high calibur of actors they have in the lead roles. Milla Jovovich, Steve Zahn and Kiele Sanchez are all good here, but Timothy Olyphant steals the show. He was good in Deadwood, but failed to impress me as the baddie in the last Die Hard movie. He's cool, mysterious, creepy at times and delivers the best performance of his career in my eyes. Other than the well accomplished cast, the twist here is really good and elevated my review from three to four stars. It really works and will have you thinking about certain scenes in a whole new light. On the downside, it took 30 minutes or so for me to get into the characters and story. Maybe it was the mood I was in, but just make it through the slow start and you will get one heck of a middle and closing. It's more of a thiller than a horror film really, but there is some nice gore towards the end, so you get the best of both worlds. A Perfect Getaway is far from perfect as the title suggests, but it's a cut above most new horror films.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

B001F3FUK6|5.0|Definite improvement over the DVD in sound and picture quality - this is the PCM/TrueHD audio version too! Well worth the double dip if you're a fan of the film.
B0000CNY27|5.0|After seeing \\"Escape from New York\\" on TV, I became a fan. I searched for it on DVD and found this Special Edition version. This release comes with a second disc with some extras, including an appoximate 10-minute clip that John Carpenter removed from the theatrical release. The clip shows what Snake Plissken did to get caught. The transfer quality of this footage is a little rough, but, by no means, would I consider it \\"unwatchable\\". Also included in this release is the first issue of \\"John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles\\", which is a four-issue comic book mini-series (being the fan that I am, I have already collected all four issues and must say the mini-series is just awesome).    All in all, if you are a big fan of \\"Escape from New York\\", I recommend this release. If you are buying this movie just to add it to your collection, and do not care about special features, then I would suggest just buying the \\"bare-bones\\" release (the one-disc release that just has the movie and nothing extra).
B000002672|5.0|Recorded between October 1985 and January 1986 at Dierks Studio in Cologne (where fellow Germans the Scorpions had previously worked), \\"Russian Roulette\\" was Accept's seventh studio album and to me remains their strongest and most consistent offering to date.  Usually people cite 1982's \\"Restless and Wild\\" or '83's \\"Balls to the Wall\\" as their best and while those are decent records, I feel the band only really started to come into their own on 1985's \\"Metal Heart,\\" which introduced some unbelievably strong melodies into the veteran group's brand of speedy power metal.  \\"Russian Roulette\\" continues this streak and even improves upon it, making the mid-'80s Accept's true glory years.<br /><br />I find it to be their strongest release because it contains some of the band's most classic and memorable tracks.  Opener \\"T.V. War\\" is an Accept signature tune, a fast and catchy number that you will be compelled to play at earth-shaking volumes on your stereo.  \\"Aiming High\\" is a tune that is a great example of a classic driving power metal riff combined with a memorable chorus.  Side 2 of the original LP opens with \\"Heaven is Hell,\\" which at over seven minutes long is a metal anthem of epic proportions with mindblowing lead work from guitarists Wolf Hoffmann and Jorg Fischer, along with the unforgettable vocal lines of the inimitable Udo Dirkschneider.  My absolute favorite song on the LP though has to be \\"Man Enough to Cry,\\" which contains one of Accept's all-time greatest riffs along with a great radio-friendly chorus and lyrics that introduce some (dare I say it) sensitivity into the usual themes of bravado of heavy metal.  Finally, there is closer \\"Stand Tight,\\" which is a call to metal brotherhood in league with Saxon's earlier anthem \\"Denim and Leather,\\" which dealt with a similar theme.  I still jam out to the original Portrait pressing of this CD (I have the vinyl too) and even it its early, un-remastered form, the digital/analog mix displays a clear production thatdemonstrates the kind of precision that could have only originated in Germany.<br /><br />All in all, I can't say enough good things about this record.  Classic Accept and one of the best power metal albums of the mid-'80s.
B001E5FYS8|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I love documentaries.  I love film in general.  I was really looking forward to viewing this, but it doesn't live up to the hype.  The feat deserves 5 stars but the story is much more placid than the feat itself.  Having the performer of the feat continue to go on and on and on about the most mundane information put my wife to sleep by the 30 minute mark.  I stuck through the film, but could not wait for the end.    I don't want to discredit the feat itself, which is really amazing, but it was lost in translation to film.
B000002B30|3.0|I enjoy all of the songs on this compilation, but for a new fan or someone wanting to be introduced to Bruce Springsteen I recommend purchasing the album \\"Born to Run\\".  This album fits the title 'Greatest Hits' better and is a better starting point.  I highly recommend the albums \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\", \\"The Wild The Innocent and E-Street Shuffle\\", \\"The River\\", and \\"Born in the USA\\" in that order to really appreciate his works.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood is so often seen as just Dirty Harry that we often don't see that he is quietly become one of the best directors of the past 25 years.  Gran Torino is a touching and subtle film that evokes such basic human feelings that you can't help but pay full attention and become absorbed into it. The characters are so basically human that you can see them in so many different settings.      Among the most refreshing aspects of this is how Eastwood's character, an unabashed racist, SOB, doesn't really change so much as evolve. What we see originally as racism is really more a case of a fellow who believes in protecting one's own and that is exactly what he does here. Eastwood deserves credit for giving himself the candor, humor and humanity to play a real human being and not fall into a caricature. I have to say this is the film that should have won for best picture!
B00000ADG2|4.0|Moer than a decade has passed since I got my hands on this CD again for a second later listen. I am still amazed by it. Lauryn Hill is underrated. Wish she would come back and make more material. The song Zion is very touching, and overall what impresses me the most is that Lauryn has her head on straight, as you will see by her lyrics. Great CD.
B00260HH3K|5.0|Everyone says this film is crap. IT IS NOT.  so what if it isn't exacly like the TV show?  when you think about it, the tv show was kind of crappy(but i am a fan!).  it had good ideas, but it was translated through the infamous japaniese's idea of tv shows, which is little-kiddish at best.    personaly i think this is a good movie, and it may not stick completly whith the origonal storyline, but i had a lot of fun with this movie. it is a fair movie!!!  PS: It is PG, so it is costruted for little kids anyway.  and COME ON!!!! we FINALY get a Movie about the tv show and we INSTIANTLY critizise it. WHO ARE WE TO DO THIS?!? what is it we realy want? maybe just another movie to be mean to.
B002DPCTZE|4.0|\\"Watchmen\\" is a surprisingly good Superhero movie. Set in an alternate timeline in 1985 where Richard Nixon is on his fifth term as president and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. I missed it in the theaters but managed to catch the Director's Cut on Amazon \\"Video on Demand\\".<br /><br />This a world where some of the \\"heroes\\" are far darker than Batman and are significantly more morally flawed than any of the comic book heroes of my childhood. That being said, these are much more human and therefore much easier to understand, with the exception of the often naked Dr. Manhattan who started as human has become very alien indeed.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, the story centers on the very disturbing hero Rorschach as he tries to figure out who is killing retired (forcibly, by law) masked avengers. Also appearing are The Comedian, Silk Specter II, Night-Owl, and several other retired heroes. All of this takes place against the backdrop of impending global destruction as the US and Soviets prepare to heat up the Cold War.<br /><br />The cinematography is nothing short of amazing, the mood is set perfectly by the camera shots, lighting, and soundtrack. There are also some outstanding special effects that really add to the realism of the movie. Other than the somewhat gratuitous scenes with Dr. Manhattan's digitally created glowing full frontal nudity, there was very little I didn't enjoy with the technical side of the movie.<br /><br />The movie has a very graphic love scene and shows a lot of actual human nudity. There is also a good bit of graphic violence and gore, as well as questionable application of vigilantly justice.<br /><br />Recommended, with the above caveats.
0767903862|5.0|I'm always amazed how my ten-year old can finish a book and then turn back to the first page and read it again, and then once she's done that start it all over again.  Bill Bryson is one of the few authors--and this goes especially for travel writers--whose works I could take pleasure in reading again.<br /><br />IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY, which chronicles two visits to Australia Bryson made to write this book (a new appendix covers Bryson's additional visit to Sydney to report on the 2000 Summer Games), begins in Sydney, follows him out through the Blue Mountains and south to the national capital district of Canberra, onward to Adelaide and Sydney's rival sister Melbourne, and then north to Surfers Paradise near Brisbane (with many side trips, of course).  After a hiatus in the States, he returns to Australia to travel in Queensland, first visiting the Great Barrier Reef and then flying to Darwin.  He travels overland to Alice Springs and makes a quick pilgrimage to Uluru, a.k.a. Ayers Rock.  Finally, he flies to Western Australia to Perth, and drives eight hours up to Shark Bay.<br /><br />Of course, it's Bryson's stories told on the way, containing a luxuriant dose of good humor, that carries the book.  Among these stories include the \\"mysterious seismic disturbance\\" in the remote Australian outback that some attributed to the Aum Shinrikyo cult (p. 4), the drowning of an Aussie Prime Minister, Harold Holt (p. 143), the massacre of Aborigines at Myall Creek (p. 191), the deaths of a pair of Yankee scuba divers at the Great Barrier Reef (pp. 217-218), Cyclone Tracy's devastation of Darwin (pp. 230-231), and the continued existence of the Great Daddy of us all, the stromatolites, descendants of the first living Earth organisms 3.5 billion years ago now living their lives in retirement off the western coast of Australia (pp. 298-299).  That's just a sprinkling of the stories; there are also the accounts of the flora and fauna, giant and (re the stromatolites) tiny, benign and deadly (witness the box jellyfish that delivers an excruciatingly painful death).<br /><br />As in A WALK IN THE WOODS, Bryson is at his best when he is traveling with someone.  This is especially true in the section on Queensland, when his traveling companion is UK television producer Allan Sherwin.  The banter is always funny; it's as if to be really on his game Bryson needs a foil.  Overall, though, Bryson is not quite as acerbic in temperament as in NOTES FROM A SMALL ISLAND.  It's true that he doesn't suffer fools gladly, whether they be benighted journalists or just plain stupid hotel clerks.  He's the kind of guy you want to travel with because he'll say what you're thinking.  Besides, he loves a good pub.<br /><br />IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY celebrates the majesty of Australia and the wonderful friendliness of its people.  Nonetheless, Bryson doesn't shy away from Australia's shameful treatment of its Aborigines.

B000SZQNLC|4.0|I remember the first time I heard this album. I was a year out of high school and working a graveyard shift at a gas station. I believe I heard it either on KLOS 101 or KILT in Houston, TX as a new release midnight album. This was a very popular radio feature on FM in those days. However I regress. At the time I thought it was not up to the usual Zep standards as their first seven albums. Thirty years later methinks I jumped to conclusions. If you listen to Zeps albums over their careers you'll hear that above all things they were innovators. At the time of this release; disco was waning, punk was \\"dying\\", and \\"new wave\\" was really creating a resurgence in innovation. My point here is that disco didn't survive, punk became today's alternative, and new wave became irrelevant because it hasn't stood the test of time.  ITTOD however has stood the test of time quite well. Is it their best? IMHO no. That title will always go to Physical Graffiti. All that said, I love the diversity on this album as I loved the same quality of PG. Other reviewers will give you a track by track breakdown to sway you one way or another. I simply say, kick back and listen to this and then tell me...does it hold up? Is it still innovative in it's sound? And my favorite meter as to whether I or anyone should by an album, do you like it? If you like it then all negative reviews be damned! We all still have the right not to be sheep but to follow our own internal compass. Which way is your compass pointing?
B0000DJE9R|5.0|THe CD is all that I expected it to be.  GReat music by an even great preformer.
B000OVLBHG|4.0|Director Paul Verhoeven freely admits that he didn't read Starship Troopers, and I doubt that screenwriter Edward Neumeier read it, either. Verhoeven read the first few chapters, but couldn't bear it. The message of the book is that military service is a duty that you owe to society. If we aren't willing to fight for our freedom, then we don't deserve it. Military discipline is praised in Heinlein's book as an almost sacred rite of passage. Verhoeven's childhood experiences during and immediately following the Second World War, first the German occupation and then the American occupation, gave him a vastly different take on the military and the Nazi propaganda Hitler used to get soldiers to enlist.<br /><br />He wanted to make a different movie, and he did. I know that Robert A. Heinlein fans were disappointed, but perhaps someone will make his 1961 novel, Stranger in a Strange Land, into a movie someday. Looking at the films that have been made of Heinlein's books we have The Puppet Masters, made into a movie with that title in 1997, and it was also made into a movie called The Brain Eaters in 1958. Then there is 1953's Project Moonbase and Destination: Moon, made in 1950. Phillip K. Dick has had Total Recall (also directed by Verhoeven), Blade Runner, Minority Report, and A Scanner Darkly, made into films, but have they ever captured the author, in all his various levels of humor, philosophy, and so forth, on the screen? Only A Scanner Darkly comes close to what Phillip K. Dick is capable of, and that film was no raging success. Blade Runner is an excellent film, but it is not Do Aliens Dream of Electric Sheep? (the book Phillip Kindred Dick actually wrote).<br /><br />I think that fans of Heinlein, especially young children, would be disturbed by the sex and violence seen onscreen in Starship Troopers. Bodies hacked to pieces by giant alien bugs, wholesale carnage, brains sucked out -- not to mention the nudity. Did you know that in the future, the infantry will be co-ed, even in the showers (on a dare from Dina Meyer Director Paul Verhoeven and cinematographer Jost Vacano shot one take of the co-ed shower scene in the nude themselves)? Perhaps a co-ed infantry is not such a bad idea after all:<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Jean Rasczak: You got 10 minutes to get ready and go.<br />Johnny Rico: Yes sir.<br />Jean Rasczak: Who's in there with you?<br />Dizzy: Flores, sir.<br />Jean Rasczak: Make it 20.<br />Johnny Rico: We can do it.<br />================================<br /><br />Verhoeven chose to do a parody that isn't going to make any Heinlein fans happy, but let's just judge the film on its own merits or lack thereof. The film has a distinctive look, kind of retro, but futuristic. It is like the pulp science fiction look of what people back in the 50's imagined the future would be, way back in the 20th Century. Throw in some Nazi style uniforms, some Cholo suspenders, and voila! A campy fascist fashion fest.<br /><br />The actors and actresses might be graduates of the Beverly Hills 90210 School of Acting, but they look fantastic. Casper Van Dien, especially looks like he would be right at home in a Goebbels produced, Leni Riefenstahl directed propaganda epic. He was born too late, as somehow, he can't break out of the television ghetto into film. You'd think that Starship Troopers would be his big break, but the critics just want to use him as their whipping boy.<br /><br />--------------------------<br />Newsreel announcer: Join the Mobile Infantry and save the Galaxy. Service guarantees citizenship. Would you like to know more?<br />=====================================<br /><br />Denise Richards won the Worst Supporting Actress Razzie Award for the 1999 film The World is Not Enough. She may not be the greatest actress since Bernhardt, but she plays one on television. She has appeared in \\"Spin City,\\" \\"Friends,\\" \\"Seinfeld,\\" \\"The Ben Stiller Show,\\" \\"Beverly Hills, 90210,\\" \\"Doogie Howser, M.D.,\\" \\"Married with Children,\\" \\"Melrose Place,\\" and \\"Saved by the Bell.\\" Her acting style is a perfect fit for ST, the only part I had trouble with was believing she had a math score of 97% and got into flight school.<br /><br />----------------------------<br />Zander: Don't exceed port speed.<br />Carmen: Or what?<br />Zander: Or they revoke your flight status... and mine.<br />Carmen: [Smiles] Your career is in my hands.<br />===========================================<br /><br />Neil Patrick Harris, on the other hand, makes a great smarty pants. After all, as Doogie Howser, M.D., he was already a doctor as a little kid. He currently rules television as Barney on \\"How I Met Your Mother,\\" but his film resume is rather light, with only the Harold & Kumar franchise willing to give him a tumble. In ST he is not only a brain, but he has psychic ability as well. He goes right into Officer Training, as the military can always use a psychic friend.<br /><br />The military can also use a High School Teacher, as Mr. Rasczak (Michael Ironside), the one armed history teacher, turns up as Lieutenant Rasczak, a gung ho officer with a bionic hand. He is tough on his men, but only because war is hell. He works hard, but he plays hard:<br /><br />--------------------------<br />Jean Rasczak: I expect the best and I give the best. Here's the beer. Here's the entertainment. Now have fun. That's an order!<br />===================================<br /><br />Though the soldiers of the Mobile Infantry fight and play hard, they have terrible strategy, fighting the alien bugs on their own turf as if there was no such thing as air support. The story doesn't make a lot of sense, but is driven more by visceral needs than by logic. For instance, though hundreds, thousands, have died in battle, they have a military funeral for just one soldier. Not even Lieutenant Rasczak is afforded that dignity. Earlier, back in boot camp the drill sergeant demonstrates the usefulness of knives in combat by pinning the recruit's hand to the wall with his knife. Later, Ace, the recruit, plays fiddle at the post battle hoe down. His hand is miraculously healed. Hey, it's Jake Busey, son of Gary Busey. He actually learned how to play the violin for this part.<br /><br />The start of ST is like some kind of bizarre John Hughes (BTW, R.I.P., Mr. Hughes) High School epic, complete with the Big Game and the Prom. Then, when Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) enlists to impress Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) it morphs into the boot camp from Full Metal Jacket. Finally, there are the big battle scenes with the alien insects. I think that the special effects, by Industrial Light and Magic, were excellent.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven makes bold and visceral films, and he is either very brave, or else he doesn't have any shame or care what people think. He was the only director who ever showed up personally to receive his Razzie Awards, and he got two of those, for Showgirl, Worst Director AND Worst Picture. I think he was at his best/worst (so bad it's good) with the Joe Eszterhas penned Basic Instinct, but Show Girls (also from the house of Eszterhas) is so relentlessly bad that you can't help but stare dumbfounded, with your jaw dropped right to the floor in disbelief. Does anyone besides me remember Spetters? Robocop, I hear, is pretty good, but I can't take Total Recall, as it was just a desecration of the book by Phillip K. Dick. Robert A.

0143113100|5.0|Recomended to me by a Doctor and using examples from this book I have enhanced my health, restoring balance after spinal surgery.  Easy to understand for any reader. I highly recomend.
0671004107|5.0|As most everyone agrees, the movie is never as good as the book. The better the book, the more disapointing the movie seems to be. Perhaps this is why it's my opinion that Contact movie is one of the worst adaptations of the book given all the changes made from the book to the movie. Spoilers to come. One of the key changes in the movie is Ellie's relationships - one of the key relationships in the book was her relationship with the preacher and the whole message of the book became acceptance between faith and science and even a bit of merging of the two. The movie radicallized both sides and made it about the battle between the faith and science - the book's point was entirely different. In the book, the clash led to acceptance, while in the movie the clash led to Ellie not being selected as the sole person to go (antoher change from the book, given that a team got to go in the book) and the first device being destroyed by religious extremists. While the destruction of one of the devices was in the book, there was an entirely different reason for it. So, all in all, given the content of the book, which I recommend, the movie was totally disappointing and diparts from the book to the extent rarely seen in recent years.
B001OQCV9M|5.0|A change of plans kept me from seeing Julie and Julia on its release date. But luckily I saw it on it's second day out. Wow! It is the best movie - by far - that I have seen in quite some time. Everything about the story was woven together so well. And unlike some movies that have casting problems, the casting was perfect in this movie.  Every character was believable and superb in their role.<br /><br />I love the weaving together of the stories and the end was brilliant.<br /><br />If you ever feel down or discouraged, you might want to own a copy of this movie to have handy.  Watch it and you will feel a whole new view of yourself and the world. This movie did what good movies are supposed to do: you are changed once you see it.
B001HVZO9S|4.0|A good story wrapped in a lot of great drumming routines/shows.  I also use the disk to demonstrate the capabilities of my Yamaha Sound Bar.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|I really enjoyed this because I like the music so much. However, if somebody doesn't like to watch recordings of concerts, I wouldn't recommend it. I'm not always a fan of the camera angles they used, but some of them were really interesting and were staged well. My big complaint is that they seemed to feature Chloe an awful lot. Not that she's bad or anything, but every other camera switch seemed to have Chloe, if there was any chance that she was on stage. She's a beautiful girl, but there are five other women on stage, too. :) I'd like to see their stage presence more.   And, I'm a musician. I want to see the orchestra and the background singers. I want to watch David Downes conduct. I really enjoy seeing different conductors' style and how they do cues and what-not, but that's probably because I also conduct.   The production is set beautifully. Slane Castle is a background to die for, and if you like Celtic Woman and their music, then yeah, you'll like it. If not, then you probably won't.
B001FB55H6|2.0|I went into this will big expectations because all I heard from fanboys was how this was going to be the greatest movie ever made. I've never heard of the Watchmen before this movie so I had no idea what it was about. I thought the movie had an interesting story about super heroes being killed off but all the side stories with them covering their origins bored me to tears. That's my biggest problem with the movie. Most of it is boring. It's very long and very boring. I didn't care about any of the characters. They're all depressing. The movie didn't pick up until the last 20min and by then I was already half asleep.<br /><br />Watchmen fans probably enjoyed it more than I did. I'm a huge fan of super hero comic movies. But this one did nothing for me.
B000KRNCYY|4.0|I alredy love Celtic music, without a doubt, and although I'm not always a huge fan of modern interpretations of it, I am a fan of David Downes's arrangements. He always has really nice harmonies, and he write for the people that are performing it. At least, it sounds like it. :)  The ladies performing do a wonderful job, too. Mairead is always inspirational. She's just fantastic! Lisa Kelly is a fabulous singer, and so are the others, Hayley, Chloe, Orla and Meav, who has recently become my favorite. I switch around a lot. :) It kind of depends on my mood. Meav is just fantastic on Dulaman. What an incredible range!   Anyway, it's wonderful music for people who like Celtic music or just new music in general. Some of the stuff would fit right in a musical. There's really something for anybody who loves vocal music.   That's it in a nutshell.
B000QUCNOK|4.0|Many excellent reviews precede this one, I'll try to put this in a Who Should, and Who Shouldn't, see this film format, with a few extra comments thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />People Who SHOULDN'T see this movie:<br />People with a low tolerance for extremely graphic images (e.g. a young orphan holding a dead rat up to his nose for an extended olfactory exploration, accompanied by a CSI like sequence in which the boy can smell the maggots inside the rat).<br />People offended by naked bodies, LOTS of naked bodies, including an orgy.<br />People that need a hero, people that feel they must admire the protagonist.<br />People that like technicolor movies, but black and white justice.<br /><br />People Who SHOULD see this movie:<br />People that either tolerate or enjoy startingly graphic images.  If you can tolerate the TV series Bones, you'll do just fine.<br />People that are tired of movies that trundle along in familiar ruts, and love the thrill of a movie that gets completely out the track and goes careening all over a cinematic/dramatic field.<br />People that watch human behavior the way a birder watches magpies, buzzards, and hawks: they want to see what HAPPENS, NOT to make moral judgments about the carnage taking place.<br /><br />For those of you fence-sitters, what might tip you into picking this DVD up:  lush photography, deep sensuality, mostly good acting (come ON, Dustin Hoffman, you can say \\"Basta!\\" better than that!!), and a truly thought provoking exploration of the world of scent.<br /><br />A few minor gripes about the author of the book and the director of the movie.  WHEN can we humans get off the virgin thing? Specifically, the FEMALE virgin obsession (no one is going to write a book about the perfect scent being composed of the essence of male virgins). Secondly, during the orgy scene, we see man on woman/woman on man (required for mass audience appeal), female on female (men seem to like this), but no male on male (unless I missed it, maybe I should go back and watch it several times?).  A bit of timidity in film-making here?<br /><br />Lastly, the book, though set in the past, has a bit of a sci-fi aspect to it (pheromones ramped up to spectacular levels).  The hard sci-fi lover in me notes two things.  First, were an aerosolizable chemical that directly and lastingly accessed the pleasure centers of the brain ever developed, it just might have the affect portrayed in the movies.  BUT, a small proportion of the population is anosmic (lack a sense of smell).  Someone in the crowd at the climactic scene would have arranged a very different ending than what we saw.<br /><br />So much for splitting hairs.  I? I love a movie that is a bit socially derailed, and mentally deranged. Perfume, The Story of a Murderer, smelled wonderful to me.times?).  A bit of timidity in film-making here?

B000021YQV|3.0|First of all, I'm by no means a fan of teenage angst, generic guitar riffs, lead singers who scream more than they sing, and average musical skills.  With THAT in mind, for some unexplainable reason, I believe Toxicity is a somewhat decent attempt at *trying* to make all those things come together to produce something interesting.  Not terribly interesting mind you, just decent enough.  Maybe it's because the band isn't concerned so much on focusing on noise and instead went the extra mile to try to make something out of their songwriting skills.    Yup, I'm totally shocked Toxicity actually has some fairly melodic ideas thrown around occasionally.  It's still a rather inconsistent album overall, but the band DOES feel like they're at least trying to lay something tolerable down on tape without making all the annoying noise as the main focus like so many other bands, something I wish most bands would STOP doing completely.  There's more than enough noisy music out there and we don't need anymore.    Still, Toxicity is an album I think is pretty alright in my book.
0316017922|4.0|This is a good read for the lay person (me) rather than the scholar.  I'm sure it's not 100% \\"true\\" and I've got disagreements with some of the author's conclusions.  However, it's interesting and will stimulate thought unless you're too rigid to take it any other way than absolute rejection or absolute approval.    Not to mention that, if you enjoy verbose pomposity, quite a few of the 'one star' reviews are very entertaining.
1932907009|4.0|Many of you probably know that Blake Snyder died suddenly this week of a heart attack.  Shocking and tragic, especially for those of us in the screenwriting community who respected him as a guru.  I just wanted to give a more timely thumbs-up here to Blake's book/s to add to the many existing pos reviews, as his book will no doubt be his lasting legacy, rather than his produced films or history as a top-selling screenwriter.  \\"Save the Cat\\" may not directly address the genres *I* happen to write in (thrillers and adult comedies), but rather focuses on high-concept family films, but its re-interpretation of modern screenplay FORM (not \\"formula\\") applies to any genre and made an immediate impression on the industry when it first came out.  This was the only book in recent years that I would recommend to my students and fellow screenwriters as it was so accessible and so focused on what REALLY is important about the modern screenplay that has any chance of raising eyebrows in Hollywood.  It truly is incredibly competitive in the spec script marketplace here in L.A., especially now as the studios are slashing development budgets and buying less original screenplays, and I lost count of the number of times I've heard an exec or rep say \\"good script but I can't sell it.\\"  So if you want to get your foot in the door with major commercial movies (and many don't; you can go the independent route and that's great, too) then your concept and logline are SO important and you need to back that up with crisp pacing and strong, surprising story beats.  And as the title stresses, a Protagonist whom we actually LIKE, as opposed to the popular \\"anti-heroes\\" of today that are despicable people and turn us off from the first scene (which is not the true definition of anti-hero, btw).  This is a must buy, and a tribute to Blake Snyder's intelligence and wit.
0143038095|2.0|I've liked some of Amy Tan's other work, but The Joy Luck Club just didn't work for me. It's a story of four Chinese mothers and their Chinese-American daughters, with seven narrators (all but the one mother who has died). The book is divided into 16 chapters, perhaps more accurately described as 16 related short stories; the women have one chapter each from childhood and one from adulthood, while Jing-mei, the daughter of the dead mother, has 4 chapters from adulthood. Most of the acclaim for this book seems to come from the portrayal of the relationships between the mothers and the daughters; they seem true-to-life but are repetitive (every daughter lacks respect for her mother and understanding of her Chinese origins; every mother speaks in vague metaphors and is always right). Many of the events portrayed are interesting, and you can't help but learn a bit about Chinese culture. If you like short stories and read them as such, this book might work for you, but it didn't for me, for two main reasons:<br /><br />1. The women's voices are indistinguishable. All of the mothers have basically the same personality; the daughters have a few differences but all talk the same way and have similar life stories. Seven first-person narrators would be a challenge for the most experienced of authors, and this is Amy Tan's first book, so it's no surprise that she falls short. I had a hard time remembering which daughter went with which mother and which childhood with which woman. As a reader of epics with dozens or even hundreds of characters, I almost never have trouble telling characters apart, especially when there are only eight of them, but I did here.<br /><br />2. There's no resolution. Stories need a beginning, middle, and end, but this one's missing the end. Jing-mei's sections book-end the novel, and she has a satisfying personal resolution, but the other six women are left in limbo. For instance, one of the younger women is in a troubled marriage. At the end of her chapter, she finally confronts her husband... and then it's over. Did they work to solve their problems? Did they get divorced? Did they deal with the personal issues that complicated the marriage in the first place? We don't know. At least three of the women's stories end this way. I don't mind books ending with some general hope for the future rather than an exhaustive tying up of loose ends, but the plot arc needs to come to a close.<br /><br />One criticism I have to disagree with, though, is the portrayal of men, especially Asian men, whom many other critical reviewers say are portayed negatively. I didn't think that was the case at all: all the girls' fathers are sympathetic figures (even the clueless American one), and two of the three troubled or failed marriages on the part of the younger generation involve women who are just as much at fault as their (white) husbands. No one is in an abusive relationship, and the men don't blatantly favor their sons over their daughters. Some of the older women have nasty men in their pasts, but with each one comes a nasty woman who encourages and enables him.<br /><br />Amy Tan isn't a bad author, and at this point she was probably still learning her limits. If you're interested in her work, I would recommend The Hundred Secret Senses, which showcases her strengths but lacks the weaknesses of this book.ally confronts her husband... and then it's over.

B001GCUER0|5.0|This boxed set is GREAT.  For those who love the series and only watched it once during the regular season, I say it's a must to watch this set, to not only see the episodes once again in crisper visuals, enjoy the incredible writing and impeccable performances (how did they cast such amazing actors across the board?) but also to enjoy some great EXTRAS.  The documentaries about the history of this period in America reveal that every reference to the period in the show is meticulously researched, and there's tons of references that you wouldn't even catch if they didn't point them out.  Those who say the show isn't accurate to the period are crazy -- yes, some of the behavior may be exaggerated and stylized, but welcome to good drama.<br /><br />The fashion review doc offers a really entertaining look at period clothing and how the designers on the show go to great lengths to not only adhere to the period but also to add their own flair.  The visuals of the episodes are great (I don't know what that guy was talking about who said it was jerky?) allowing the eye to linger on the incredible lighting and set design which rise above most of the major movies of today.<br /><br />Then there's the many COMMENTARIES, which reveal so much insight.  They go deep into the bench of actors for some of the commentaries with the supporting players we love so much, like Christina Hendricks (Joan Holloway) and Vincent Kartheiser (Pete Campbell) so we get insights we wouldn't normally get from the big stars.<br /><br />I particularly like how in this season those supporting characters get more development and the actors get to shine in new story arcs, like Joan's faceoff with Paul Kinsey over his black girlfriend, Peggy's relationship with the priest played by Colin Hanks, Pete and Trudy Campbell's conflict over adoption, Roger Sterling's next disastrous step in his mid-life crisis in dumping his wife for a 20 year-old, and of course the Jimmy and Bobby Barrett arc which creates a chasm between Don and Betty which may never be filled and leads Don to run from his present issues and allows us to learn more about his past.<br /><br />What a great show.  Maybe the greatest.  If Season 3 doesn't justify my very existence, I may just hurl myself off a skyscraper like that silhouette guy in the opening title sequence.  Kidding. (kinda)  :-0nd Betty which may never be filled and leads Don to run from his present issues and allows us to learn more about his past.    What a great show.  Maybe the greatest.

B00275EGWO|5.0|The DVD:  [[ASIN:B00275EGWY The Hurt Locker]]<br /><br />Katherine Bigelow  seems an unlikely choice for the directorial helm of Matt Boal's script for a war-themed independent film, \\"The Hurt Locker\\" (and the title's unlikely, too).  Boal was last seen penning \\"In the Valley of Elah\\" , in which he turned a laudable screenplay from a hauntingly true story he had written for Playboy.  I personally think that Boal was arm-wrestled into many of the aspects of the screenplay by powerful director and co-writer Paul Haggis during \\"In the Valley\\".  That, in fact, might be why Boal sought out someone who was more concerned about seeing the realism of the war in Iraq as it is, and not trying to politicize a story.  The story, simply, is one  of every day Americans confronted by the need to put their lives on the line in a country that is as hellish as the Iraq in 2004, in the wake of our great adventure there.<br /><br />Hand-held camera shoots in \\"The Hurt Locker\\" give the gritty, real appearance of Iraq in the film.  Bigelow shot in  Jordan, when she could not overcome obstacles to filming in Kuwait, and the camera scenes can make one weary, in 137 minutes of film, But most of the film is so gripping, and the scenes portrayed do have a tendency to make everyone involved weary, weary of the war.  Bigelow and Boal don't have to preach that war is hell, they just portray it in the realism of the film.  We get it.<br /><br />The story line involves a 3 person EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit, charged with finding and clearing explosive devices that seemingly litter the landscape in Iraq.  I've done some fiction and non-fiction reading about bomb techs in metropolitan areas in the US, and recognize that the specialty is populated with people who live their lives knowing that the next assignment could cost them those self-same lives.  Not a vocation for the weak at heart.  As the film begins, the trio in the EOD Hummer includes the bomb tech, Sgt. Thompson (Guy Pearce in a good cameo), the driver, Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie, largely unsung before this film),  and the Specialist, who acts as the lookout and the turret gun in the Hummer, Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).  The three work well together.<br /><br />In shocking and violent order, Thompson breathes his last, and is replaced with Staff Sgt James (Jeremy Renner who was cast as Dahmer early in his career in the film of the same name. Renner has kicked around film and TV since then - he appeared as a lead in \\"The Unusuals\\" in this TV season, opposite Amber Tamblyn.  It was not renewed.).  As James, Renner has turned in a performance so finally nuanced, that his name will no doubt come up at Oscar time.<br /><br />Sanborn and Eldridge don't know what to make of the new bomb tech, who is silent and somewhat reckless, a contrast to the confident Thompson, who was a team player.  Over the course of their time with him, you can sense the two of them swinging into his rhythm, learning to anticipate his quirky style and the aplomb with which he's handled 800 explosive devices.  Attribute this to the strong delivery Renner brings to the \\"silent cowboy\\" type.  The unit has only 39 days left on their tour.<br /><br />With Eldridge, and to a lesser degree, Sanborn, your sense is that they are waiting on the edges of their chairs for the tour to be over, so that they can escape with their lives and revisit the hellish assignment in dreams.  With James, you get the feel that the 39 days is not enough; that only when he is pursuing his special trade does he feel at one with the world.  There are sidelines to James' story; one in his relationship with a young Iraqi boy, and one in his inability to shoulder his homelife with wife and young son.<br /><br />Because of their vocation, and because of the reality of the fear in the Iraqi streets, the intensity in this film makes time pass swiftly, absorbs the viewer in the reality.  The actual bombs are stark in their violence, the feel of the streets is that of underlying deception.  There is a scene in the last half of the film where the unit encounters a group of contractors (cameos by Ralph Fiennes and David Morse), that potentially could have come out in editing, but it serves as a contrast of what the different dangers are when EOD units are exposed in the open desert, and not in the city streets.<br /><br />And \\"the hurt locker\\" of the title?  It stands for a collection kept by James of items found at the bomb scenes; items that immediately call each scene to mind in the collection of nightmares that he's grown addicted to.  And he is addicted; never doubt that.<br /><br />Realistic and timely, \\"The Hurt Locker\\" may be one of the best movies you can see this year.e is a scene in the last half of the film where the unit encounters a group of contractors (cameos by Ralph Fiennes and David Morse), that potentially could have come out in editing, but it serves as a contrast of what the different dangers are when EOD units are exposed in the open desert, and not in the city streets.

074322454X|5.0|The Band of Brothers HBO mini-series had me waiting in anticipation for each new episode to come out. Reading the book it was based on was a definite thrill. As I read through chapters, pictures would erupt from my memory from the mini-series even though I hadn't seen it in a couple of years. Steven Ambrose has the ability to insert the reader into events like you were one of the participants. Ambrose maintains the excitement and momentum from the rigors of training and R&R to the high action combat sequences. Even if you hate to read, you would enjoy this book.    If you have not watched the mini-series, this book is about the actions of E (easy) company of 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. The book covers a collection of stories from Easy company's founding in Camp Toccoa, Georgia through their training to their drops and combat actions in Europe through the 101st inactivation in November 1945. The story tries to explain why the men of the airborne volunteered and how they were able to survive the war. The source of the story is mostly from interviews with men of Easy company.    To read the book or not. Honestly, there was not a lot from the book that was not captured in the mini-series. This actually made me appreciate the quality work done by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg in the mini-series. But, there are a few parts left out and more information about the men of E company after the war than in the mini-series. I thought the book was a good companion to the mini-series. Reading the book will definitely rekindle some good memories and encourage you to watch the mini-series again.    If your new to reading about World War II, I would also recommend [[ASIN:0684803305 A Bridge Too Far: The Classic History of the Greatest Battle of World War II]] by Cornelius Ryan.
B001JNNE64|5.0|This is my first blu-ray movie so to me it seems FANTASTIC. i have the Director's Cut DVD but with this Blu-ray Edition it makes the movie even greater... it has a special CD compilation with the music of the film (sir Nevill Mariner conducting Mozart's Music), and a booklet! Very Recommended!  I'm not writing review for the movie becouse i assume you heard about the movie and probably watched it couple of times, but if you didn't... don't tell anybody, go rent it or buy it and watch it!

0061122416|2.0|The Alchemist evokes the imagination of a wide-eyed child--and unfortunately the wisdom doesn't get much deeper than that of a child, either. Interlaced within the boy's fantastic journey are tales of love, suffering, betrayal and courage, all wrapped in frivolously light-hearted rhetoric that tries to address one of the biggest questions of human existence: \\"what are we here for\\"?    Coelho entertains religion with the politically-correct implication that all religions seek to capture the Soul of the World--a contrived notion so predictably new-agey that you'll likely either love it or cringe. Although the author takes upon a heavy Judeo-Christian bent, it's an inoffensively palatable and fluffy amalgam of ideas that conveniently picks and chooses bits from different world views.    Even brushing aside the sappy underlying ethos, it's hard to ignore the simplistic and flat writing that neither inspires nor ignites passions. I suppose it's meant more to be an inspirational motivator, for those that'd find its fortune-cookie morsels of wisdom to be uplifting (if not for a fleeting moment before the less romantic reality sets in).
B0026RHR6K|4.0|This has all been said before and will be said again, so I'll be brief. Loved the series, hate the packaging. I'm giving it four stars for the series alone. The complete series seems to just be a repackaging of seasons 1-4.5 with little else to offer other than a slightly lower price and the Cylon centurion. But, as I said, it's a great series so I'd recommend purchasing it despite the lousy package.
1416549447|4.0|I just took up running last March with a beginner group.  We were guided by the principles of this book but quite loosely.  I wanted to learn more so I read Chi Running.   It was a wonderful resource that addresses the body's bio-mechanics, alignment, posture, and form.  It draws from the same principles as Yoga, Pilates, and T'ai Chi.  It spends just as much time on conditioning the mind as well as the body.  Having these guidelines to review while on a run really helped my training (I stopped feeling like I was pounding pavement with every step) and I was able to smoothly ramp up from barely running 20 minutes to completing a 10K without injury.  Next stop, half-marathon.

B0009XNUK0|5.0|Michael Jackson gave us so much wonderful music during his lifetime; and this two CD set showcases his fine talent. Michael is consistently at the top of his game on these tracks; there's not a dud in the bunch. The quality of the sound on these two CDs is excellent and I like the artwork as well.<br /><br />\\"I Want You Back\\" starts the first CD off with Michael doing a great job with the rest of The Jackson 5; they sing and play this to perfection--and beyond! \\"ABC\\" is very catchy. \\"Got To Be There\\" is a very romantic song that is truly a classic; Michael's genius is clearly abundant even at a very early age. He sings \\"Got To Be There\\" with all his heart and soul; and he never lets go of a single superfluous note, either! \\"Rockin' Robin\\" is infectiously catchy and upbeat, too--and how's about that guitar solo?<br /><br />\\"Ben\\" is a masterpiece even if Michael is singing a song about a pet rat (!!!); Michael's excellent diction makes \\"Ben\\" even more beautiful. \\"Enjoy Yourself\\" again has Michael with the rest performing just wonderfully; and it's got that `70s beat I always like so much. \\"Blame It on the Boogie\\" is still perfect for dancing nearly wherever you are; and there's yet another gem in \\"Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground).\\" Listen also for Michael to deliver \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" without ever skipping a beat; and he does outstanding work as he sings \\"Rock with You;\\" \\"Off The Wall\\" and a great duet with Paul McCartney entitled \\"The Girl Is Mine.\\" \\"Billie Jean\\" was a huge hit for Michael when it was released; and it remains one of his best tunes ever.

B0000DJE9R|4.0|The songs are great!  However, the reproduction of the CD sucks. Two of the songs on the CD end/just cut off before they are actually over and a new song begins.  That was the only disappointing factor on this purchase
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I have already watched this concert at least 10 times since I purchased it. I wish I had seen it in person when he was on tour. Great entertainment MJ style. If you are a Michael Jackson fan I recommend buying this DVD. You will not be disappointed.

This is a collection of videos from his number one hits and includes clips of his moon walk performance (Motown 25) and of his performance at the 1995 MTV awards. I enjoyed those the most but the entire DVD is very entertaining. I am not disappointed with anything on this DVD.

0596527055|5.0|This book is 147 pages and came with a slip sleeve cover. It's an easy read. Not a very good book to write a paper about. Each chapter goes over a specific myth, and never clearly \\"confirms\\" or \\"denies\\" the myth. It is still a very good book, but I wouldn't go too far with it.
159448385X|5.0|I only read this book upon recommendation from a friend. It is not within my normal genre of reading and I was apprehensive to open it. Once I did, however, I could not put it down. It was filled with gut-wrenching heartache and little moments of pure bliss. My husband has been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan several times and it was wonderful to finally understand what the country of Afghanistan has been through and how it has affected the culture with the different change in governments and countless bouts of war. I found it most interesting, as a woman, to see how the lives of Afghan women were affected. I cannot think of a more brave and honorable depiction of women than this wonderful book. Read it, you'll understand.

0312370849|5.0|One of the best reads in the last two years. Like Geraldine Brooks's People of the Book, this novel successfully sweeps us off somewhere dark and difficult, to a place that shows some of the tragedies and redemptions of human actions. A compelling read, creating for us images that will stick for years in our memories, Sarah's Key does just what it set out to do: wake us up to a part of our history too long ignored. We need, from time to time, to be forced to look into our recent pasts - look into the mirror - to help guide our future.
B00288KNL8|3.0|Just a quick note to add to the other voices - the film is good, trippy, fun - a stop animation classic. But the 3D red/green thing is very poor - I'd go so fart o say that it actually detracts from the film. Even projected onto a highly reflective screen in a dark home theater, the film is quite dim and almost monochromatic. The depth perception adds minimally to just a few scenes. I much preferred watching the fiim again in\\"2D\\".
0307455378|2.0|La Sombra del Viento was one of the best books I ever read. I read it at traffic lights while the car was stopped, in the middle of a gathering of friends...anywhere.   I had been waiting for Carlos Ruiz Zafon's next book for several years and when this one came out, I bought it immediately. As opposed to La Sombra.., this book is depressing, dark, its characters are not-believable and the whole plot leaves you upset. May be I did not \\"get it\\"... I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the next one!
B000059XUO|4.0|I'm a late comer to this flick.  It flew under my radar despite it's fervent cult following.  I'm glad I've finally seen it because it is terrific.  My best analogy is it reminds me of \\"Blade Runner\\" crossed with John Woo but director Alex Proyas offers enough original fluorishes that the movie stands on it's own.  The action is breakneck and there's a stunning goth look to the whole venture.  The selling point is the presence of Brandon Lee who tragically died in an on set accident.  Lee distinguishes himself from his father, Bruce Lee, and his work here suggests greater things if he had lived.  Not classic stuff but better than average fantasy fare.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|\\"I said I love you, I thought you knew, the last thing to do, was to try to betray me\\" -this a line line from first track \\"Not Too Much Just Out of Sight,\\" a wonderfully loud, howling and angry rocker that is your first indication that this is not a typical Paul McCartney album.  It is a stunning song - I don't think that I have ever heard Paul McCartney this angry (I think we all know who he was signing about)- and it is great.  To be honest, I passed on buying this CD when it first came out.  Having heard that is was an \\"experimental\\" album of \\"electronic\\" music, I figured it was another of the weird and ecentric pet projects that Paul (and the other Beatles) had released over the years.  However, last week I really enjoyed Paul singing two of the album's songs at his Washington, DC concert (the fabulous rocker \\"Highway\\" and the uplighting and spiritual \\"Sing the Changes\\")and decided to give it a chance.  Good thing that I did - I have been playing it ever since.  There are so many great songs on this album - I think that my favorite is \\"Two Magpies,\\" an accoustic track that could easily fit on The Beatles White Album.  I could go on talking about each song.  Suffice to say, this is no pet project - it is a major artistic statement.  It also may be Paul's best solo album since Band on the Run (and I am a person who likes most of Paul's solo work).  Give the CD a chance, I think that you will be pleasantly surprised.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|The Bottom Line:    One has to wonder if sometimes Mr. McNamara is deliberately telling things from a perspective that will make his own involvement in the events discussed more palatable, but that quibble aside it cannot be denied that The Fog of War is a fascinating film recommended to anyone interested in 20th Century U.S. History; it's not likely to disappoint you.    3.5/4
1440469563|1.0|I'm sure if I hadn't seen the movie, (DVD) I wouldn't have had the least understanding of what was going on half the time.<br /><br />The book was very boring, with long unending sentences and characters that made no sense.  Yet, I kept reading and reading until I was done.  I think I was determined to make some sense out of it. After words and words of whatever, the ending came to a short, brief end.  To this day, I'm not sure if Marianne was ever in love with Mr. Brandon, or she just admired him and married him because her family thought it best. Nor could I find one single reason why Elinor who was to have had some sense would  have fallen for an idiot like Edward.<br /><br />The long silly relationship between Edward and Lucy was ridiculous, and made no sense at all. For the older sister to even care for a nerd like Edward when she was the one who was supposed to have some sense, made no sense.  As to the rest of the characters, they were all ridiculous, pompous or stupid, and had no sense or sensibility at all.<br /><br />The film was much better.  Don't bother with the book.

B002DPH8VY|3.0|This is really weird...or is it simply another UK NME hype. Probably the latter. Indeed while we have seen some great female independent performers this year, i.e. Ladyhwake, La Roux..., this is really not that good. Basically she sings very loudly, thus the title, Lungs, and the music backing her is nothing  more than soem very simplistic banging on druma and percussion. It is actually so bad it is embarrassing. There are no tunes...
B001UV4XU6|5.0|(500) DAYS OF SUMMER comes the closest to a sensitive guy's point of view on romantic love than any other film I have seen.  I thought FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL came pretty close, but not anymore.  The one scene in FOUR WEDDINGS that I liked was when the Hugh Grant character wondered if he was being too selective in choosing the perfect wife thereby preventing him from finding true love.  Now (500) DAYS takes that a step further.  First, the narrative structure of the film is exactly the way we remember a failed relationship.  We don't start at the beginning and then work our way to the end--we jump around.  We remember the good times, the bad times, and wonder why the relationship didn't work out.  Second, when a relationship doesn't work out, we're quick to rule out that true love exists.  This happened in FOUR WEDDINGS and (500) DAYS.  The difference between the two films is that in FOUR WEDDINGS, the Grant character gets the girl of his dreams in the end.  **SPOILER ALERT**  In (500) DAYS, the opposite happens.  Although Summer was initally attracted to Tom probably because he liked The Smiths, she never fell in love with him.  This is something that's hard for Tom (or most guys) to understand.  We like to be in control of our relationship (or have the girl love us back) and when we're not, we take it as a personal rejection.  This may not sound like much, but it's really true.  Look at the love stories where the guy is the mentor to the girl, such as PYGMALION, MY FAIR LADY, ANNIE HALL, etc.  The guy is the mentor because he is controlling the girl to think the way he does.  Third, (500) DAYS explores the question if love is accidental or if we can do something about it?  I loved the film clips of THE GRADUATE in it because it seemed to suggest that if you want to get the girl of your dreams, you have to do something about it, including banging on the windows of a church in Santa Barbara, CA.  But then (500) DAYS made it seem like Tom and Summer's relationship was accidental.  No matter what Tom did, there was no way Summer was going to fall in love with him because there just was no chemistry between them--at least from her end.  Anyway, this review has gone on long enough.  I loved everything about this film: the writing, directing, acting, etc.  Highly recommended.
B0000004V2|3.0|While by no means catastrophic, this album has been greatly over-rated since the start. One the one hand, their greatest song, which was from that era, Fool's Gold, is not from the original version of the album and has been only added on later versions. That song was and is fantastic and does correspond to exactly what the hype was about: the perfect fusion of dance with rock estaetics. However the rest of the album is not that great. While one can see that they are talented, the sound is musddy and the playing is sloppy. While these characteristics are what makes a hypnotic song like Fool's Gold great, the remainder of the songs which are more straightforward in structure do suffer. The next record was actually somewhat better since production values were superior but since the band had been so much over-hyped, survival was not posssible and they split. Also a group such as the Happy Mondays were abloe at their best to convey much more energy in their songs.

B000JLPMPS|5.0|I had not seen UNFORGIVEN for nearly a decade when I popped in my HD DVD the other night.  I'm not sure what made me decide to view it, but I'm very glad I did.  Despite all the other \\"revisionist\\" Westerns that have come since the time Eastwood's masterpiece won Best Picture at the Oscars...none have managed to equal it.    Recently, critics and audiences alike were saying that Eastwood's role in GRAN TORINO was the culmination of all his previous work and served as a commentary on it as well.  I was one of those people.  In TORINO, Eastwood's character achieves a kind of grace or redemption.  However, one could just as easily conclude that UNFORGIVEN was the final commentary on Eastwood's career, at least in Westerns, by Eastwood himself.  And let's put it this way...the film is well named.  Eastwood is suggesting that for those with killing in their blood, there is not redemption or grace.  Except, perhaps, the grace that comes with acknowledging who you are, no matter how terrible.    In the tiny western town of Big Whiskey, there isn't much to do back in 1880.  There's the usual general store, blacksmiths and of course, the local bar/cathouse.  Two cowboys from the big ranching organization that is the reason Big Whiskey exists at all come to visit the employees of the cat house, and when one of the ladies makes the mistake of giggling at one of the cowboys, he goes on a rampage and proceeds to cut up her face.  The hookers are outraged, and encouraged by their leader (Frances Fisher, in a remarkably fierce performance) scrape their savings together and let it be known to the world that have a reward for anyone who can kill these two cowboys and avenge this brutal act.    One who heeds this call is \\"The Schofield Kid\\" (Jaimz Woolvett), a young braggart with more swagger than experience.  His uncle was an old riding companion of William Munny (Eastwood), a \\"retired\\" killer...so The Kid looks up this legendary figure to see if he'll go with him on this manhunt.Munny is a widower struggling to raise his two kids on a clearly failing pig farm.  His deceased wife had reformed Munny, turning him away from drinking and killing, and towards a calmer more ethical life.  However, Munny recognized that he could really use the money, and when The Kid exaggerates the extent of the harm caused to the prostitute...Eastwood uses this as a rationalization to leave his kids behind and join The Kid.  They also bring along Munny's old partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman)...another killer who has made an effort to settle down and change his life.    Back in Big Whisky, the sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) is obsessed with keeping his town lawful.  He has outlawed all guns, yet he metes out justice with the casual cruelness of a psychopath.  A well-read, seemingly friendly and reasonable psychopath, to be sure.    UNFORGIVEN is over two hours long, and it allows the inevitable collision between Munny's gang and the sheriff's men to slowly brew.  We get to know Munny and Logan during their trek to Big Whiskey in scenes on horseback and around campfires that seem SO terribly clichéd...yet instead, they are full of dry humor, meaningful character development and beautiful scenery.  We get to know the terrifyingly bland ferocity of Little Bill as he spends a long, mesmerizing evening with English Bob (Richard Harris), an infamous gun-for-hire who has come to Big Whiskey to accept the prostitutes' challenge.  Bob has been accompanied by W.W. Beauchamp, a writer who is serving as Bob's sycophantic biographer.  Little Bill crushes the ego of one man (and his body too) and brings the other under his thrall.    In the end, there is much killing and it is in these murders that UNFORGIVEN makes its mark.  To say that the film strips the standard western theme of revenge of all its glamour would be to deny the film much of the credit it is due.  One scene in particular (I'll try not to spoil it) shows a killing that is as senseless and sad as any you're likely to see.  The person killed dies a slow, sad death...and those around him are frankly appalled at the squalidness of what has happened, including the killers.      As the film nears its conclusion, Munny observes: \\"It's a hell of a thing, killing a man. Take away all he's got and all he's ever gonna have.\\"  On paper, this statement sounds true but not particularly brilliant.  Trust me, in the film, it resonates and pierces the heart.  Never has one line in a film so perfectly captured its own theme.  In UNFORGIVEN, when people die, we feel the consequences.  Wives that will never see their husbands again.  Guilt that will never be washed clean.  Words that can never be forgotten, even with the help of booze.  Simple pleasures of living a life that will never be enjoyed.  Dignity that will be forever lost.  Stains that will never clean.       The film holds such power, because Eastwood the Director holds total command of his tone.  He fully understands the standard development of a Western and seldom deviates far from it.  He shows that simply showing the events of a standard Western through the lens of what it REALLY would have been like strips away all the \\"good vs. evil, white hats vs. black hats\\" and leaves you in a murky world where all is shades of gray, and the \\"good guys\\" are just a breath away from being the \\"bad guys.\\"  The film has a leisurely pace...it is not an action film.  The scenes of violence are quick and blunt.  But if you enjoy a film with a strong statement to make and a love of characterization...you'll appreciate UNFORGIVEN.  There are moments of wonderful humor, whether around Little Bill's efforts to build his own house or The Kid's efforts to be tough.  But for the most part, it is stark and bleak.  Never has being stuck in a rainstorm felt so miserable.  Yet the land is always beautiful, and it's easy to remember what would have drawn men to this part of the country...the promise that beauty held.    Everyone is outstanding in thefilm.  Richard Harris, for his few minutes on screen, is riveting in the way he absolutely does NOT blend in with everyone around him.  Woolvert strikes the right tone of annoying yet somehow sympathetic.  Morgan Freeman gives one of his best supporting turns in perhaps the most sympathetic character of the film.  Eastwood and Freeman sure have an easy, believable chemistry on film (see MILLION DOLLAR BABY).  Gene Hackman certainly deserved his Oscar for this film...what a toweringly great actor he is...yet he never seems to be acting.  He's one of the slyest performers we have, an actor who inhabits his characters with seemingly no effort, yet the results, even in poor films make him stand out.  And Eastwood gives a performance that is every bit the equal of his work in GRAN TORINO.  Over the years, some of his work as an actor and director hasn't always been great.  He's got a comfort zone probably shouldn't stray from (yet, as I say that, I remember how remarkably credible he was in BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY)...but when he's in the zone, his work is not only mesmerizing, it is iconic.  He has a face that is perfect for the modern western, whether that western takes place in 1880 Big Whiskey or in current day suburbia.  Eastwood is an American classic, and UNFORGIVEN ranks among his crowning achievements.    (I mentioned my HD DVD earlier...if you're watching this again someday, please try to treat yourself to the hi-def version if you can.  The scenery is absolutely spectacular.)
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|It's great to see the guys lose the jangly, bluesy pop in favor of pristine, power pop.  I think this CD is a perfect culmination of everything they've done so far -- it's clean without being sterile; emotional depth without sentimentality; great musicianship, vocals, and melodies all in a cohesive whole with an authority and confidence they sometimes lack.  I can now die a happy a-ha fan.

0385491026|3.0|Cat's Eye explores the girlhood experiences of artist Elaine Risley as she negotiates her relationship with Cordelia, a mean girl who bullies her relentlessly through emotional manipulation.  There have been many nonfiction books written on the topic of girl aggression in recent years, Mean Girls and Odd Girl Out come to mind, but Atwood's novel gives a gut-wrenching insight into the victim's frame of mind, while still managing to suggest the pressures that may motivate the aggressor.  The protagonist never really \\"gets over\\" the damage done to her psyche by her tormentor, and her scars color all her subsequent relationships as well as her idea of herself.      The novel has that characteristic Atwood voice that echoes with understatement and deadpan delivery across a chasm of emotional turmoil, never actually getting drawn into it, but suggesting it nevertheless.  While this is not my favorite Atwood novel, its characters and situations are memorable and its subject matter is, sadly, not at all dated.
1554072840|5.0|I purchased this book a quarter-century ago when first broaching the subject of using the potty with my elder daughter. To this day, I can still hear her giggles and \\"Nooooooooo\\" when I'd ask \\"Is it a hat?\\" \\"Is it a food bowl for the cat?\\" followed by her delighted squeal of \\"IT'S A POTTY!\\" At about 18 months, she had memorized all the text and loved this book as much, if not more, than any other. Her younger sister, fastidious from birth, potty-trained herself in one day at 13 months of age - and whether this book played a role, I don't know. She certainly heard it read by me and recited from memory by her sister countless times. The moment my elder daughter learned her \\"Baby Sister\\" was going to make her an aunt, the first thing she said to me was \\"We can buy the baby ONCE UPON A POTTY!\\" My daughters and little granddaughters have always had well-stocked libraries, with many books read and soon forgotten, but this one has cherished memories attached to it and has become a family tradition. I've given this book to other little ones over the years who were approaching potty-training age, as well, and they delight in being in on the \\"secret\\" that the chamber pot is none of the other creative possibilities suggested. Whether it inspires them to use the potty sooner than they might otherwise, who knows? But, it does tickle them - and I think it's a perfect, low-key, entertaining way to take the first step on the path to being diaper-free.
0739343947|3.0|yes, I missed the part in the discription that said Abridged.  I purchased this as part of a college reading assignment.  I did not have time to read the book so I purchased the CD's.  In the class discussion and on the test I found out that abridged really meats that they cut out all of the meat of the story.  Most of the fine details have been removed.  If you are looking for recreational reading or listening I do highly recomend this selection, however as a reading assignment it is not good enough for an \\"A\\".  If you are happy with a \\"C\\" great you are all set.<br /><br />I also had a very difficult time with the shipping from Amazon.  I had the selection shipped to me UPS Red or Next Day Air.  Next Day Air usually means next day before 10:00AM, but Amazon puts a little suffix on the end of the shipping code that saves them money on the shipping and changes the delivery to next day before 7:00PM.  I payed more for the shipping than I did for the selection and received my package at 6:30PM the next day.  I was and am still very upset about that.  So, if you need it order sooner than later and don't pay extra for quick delivery.  I found out that Amazon ships from all over the country and is usually one day ship to everyone, not guaranteed but usually.

1594488916|4.0|This is technically a True Crime book, with an unusual subject. Whereas most TC books detail heinous crimes of serial killers and the like, this book is about a thief of books, of all things!  Allison Bartlett provides the reader with a profile of John Gilkey, known in the rare book world for his international scams, which have sent him in and out of prison.    Bartlett does a good job of presenting her subject's delusions and distortions; Gilkey feels that rare, collectible, and valuable books, which formed as status symbols during his youth, are without his reach due to financial restrictions, and this is unfair, so he must even the score by stealing them.      Bartlett states that Gilkey's deeds are crimes of passion, but this is inaccurate. Gilkey is a covetous sociopath; books are simply the chosen objects of his sociopathic fixation.  It could have been anything else, but it was books because of his childhood associations with them as objects of wealth. Also, his family is a collecting family; everything from salt and pepper shakers to books to frog figurines.    Intense chapters detailing Bartlett's interviews and experiences with the palpably creepy book thief are offset by chapters detailing the book world; its dealers (who have been scammed by Gilkey), jargon (incunabula, elephant folios, ephemera), collectors with integrity, as well as trends; \\"When a movie adaptation is released...first editions of the book often become temporarily hot property among collectors.\\"    I am unsure as to whether this will appeal to non-bibliophiles. Your average True Crime reader will most likely find the subject matter extremely pale in comparison to the horrors they are used to reading about.  TC readers might wonder how this group of people (book dealers, the author, even the bibliophilic reader) could get so worked up about a book thief.  But read the book and you will quickly feel disdain for Gilkey, if not for his lack of integrity and self-set delusions, then for hisexcited anticipation of the publication of this book, and for his suggestions to the author for how the book should end!    I am an admitted bibliophage, and I found this to be engrossing and quite interesting.
0380820498|4.0|It's definitely important to bring out that this is a police procedural which is a different sub genre from \\"cozies\\", and thrillers.   Author Peter Robnson generally succeeds in surprising us when the perp is revealed after leading us through a detailed investigation.  The characters are thoroughly human and we do know a bit of their domestic lives.  In this case, we're given the first hints that the marriage between Alan and Sandra Banks may not survive.                                                     My only reservation in this book is the abbreviated closure. True, Robinson had deliberate reason in letting us fill in the blanks, but I would have liked seeing reactions from the various characters after the final sentence.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|What can I say, the best financial calculator out today.<br /><br />I own 12c (which for its age is a great calculator). But 12c platinum is so much faster, with more features and longer battery life.<br /><br />I am an MBA student and this is by far the best calculator for school and work.<br /><br />If you are looking for a financial calculator, do not waste your money on other brands and models (especially HP 20b),spend a little more money and get the calculator that will last a lifetime.<br /><br />I think HP should stop making computers and concentrate on making great financial products.
B002CAWNEM|4.0|First of all I have to admit that even during the opening credits where there where showing scenes of Idris Alba and Beyonce Knowles moving into their fixer-upper dream house, my friend and I knew this movie was going to be very predictable. For the most part we were dead on accurate. Ali Larter's character of Lisa took all her motives and actions from 'How to stalk in a movie FOR DUMMIES' AND CLEARLY has watched Fatal Attraction and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle more than once.<br /><br />However, this movie is a lot of FUN.  Beyonce seems to be the only smart one, and you tend to cheer her on for the entire film even though her main portion comes after about an hour in.  Idris Alba's character of Derek tends to make some cliche mistakes along the way, but he isn't as completely dumb as one would expect.  Also, even when some of Lisa's attemps for attention fail you think to yourself \\"well. she will just try harder\\"...and then she does and even that in itself is entertaining.<br /><br />As an entry in the genre this surely is not ground-breaking by any means and I doubt it will help any of the three actors careers, but admit it, we all just wanted to see Beyonce beat down the white chick who was tryin' to move in on her family, and that goal was accomplished.  The formulaic plot and obvious character flaws make one seem like they are shouting at a bad horror movie rather than a suspense thriller, but it also means that as an audience member, one can just enjoy the absurdity and the satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />I think that even by the end of the movie Beyonce herself even knew the movie was too predictable because when the detective (played by Christine Lahti) asks what happened in the house, Beyonce says \\"You know what happened in there.\\" I think th at line was not only for the character but also a nod to the audience also.  If you go in with very mild expectations, you should enjoy this movie quite a bit.
031606792X|3.0|I've read a lot of bad reviews on here for Breaking Dawn.  Didn't stop me from reading the book, however.  I didn't start reading the Twilight series until all the books had come out, so I'm pretty late on the bandwagon.  However, I personally thought that this book was better than the first two of the series.  I barely got through the first two (although now I'm glad I had, because I enjoyed Eclipse and Breaking Dawn considerably more), because Bella unnerved me way too much, and it's hard to like a book if you grate your teeth at the protagonist every time she describes Edward's beautiful body and how unworthy she is of it.  Anyway, I enjoyed Breaking Dawn for the following reasons:    1)  Bella finally starts focusing more on herself, and less on Edward's perfection.  One of the things that annoyed me the most with the first two books of the series was Bella's relentless diatribes on how she was soooo unworthy of Edward because he was a beautiful, immortal vampire and she was just a clumsy, plain girl.  In this book, after Bella gains her own powers, you actually feel like she's tolerable.  Plus, her diverted focus on Renesmee was a good change.    2)  The second part of the book, written in Jacob's POV.  I personally think Jacob is one of the most likable characters in the series, who repeatedly gets screwed.  We start wondering, WHY does he like Bella so much?  Why doesn't he get a clue, when she rebuffs him all the time?  I liked getting into his head.  Plus, his POV was a lot funnier and dynamic than Bella's same...old...tirades.    3)  This book was action-packed from start to finish.  I remember thinking it was a big shame that in Twilight, the main action of the book took place in the last 50 pages.  The rest felt like a very long drag.  Even though there were some big disappointments in this book, I still sped through it pretty fast.  It was the only Twilight book that kept me engaged completely from page 1 to the last.      4)  Jacob gets his own happy ending.  He's been pretty shafted throughout the series, to the point where if he didn't get a happy ending, I'd wonder if he was a sadomasochist.  Sure, it's a little sick, as some people have mentioned.  But I think Meyer makes a big point of saying that imprinting doesn't mean the werewolf is sexually interested in the baby, it just means he unconditionally loves her and will take care of her regardless, even if it means suffering endless childhood games as Quil did.  Also, given that Renesmee ages at like, 20x the rate of a normal child, she'd be Jacob's age within a span of like, 7 years anyway.  That doesn't seem too long to wait.    5)  The Volturi finally show themselves and make some action after thousands of pages of waiting.  'Nuff said.    Overall, though I don't think Breaking Dawn was a literary masterpiece, it was entertaining for what it is.  Which is a dramatic, somewhat insipid Vampire romance for young adults.  I think Meyer did a good job of tying up loose ends, even if some parts were wayyyy out there (baby clawing out of Bella's stomach?  ...no thanks, I really don't want to see that adapted into film).  I agree with other reviewers that there seemed to be lots of inconsistencies, particularly the one where Bella sidesteps being a rabid young vampire and becomes the most powerful, but since this is, after all, fantasy young adult lit, I didn't expect it to be too realistic anyway.
B001OQCV9M|4.0|It is a story of two women ,and how food ,friends and good wine bring people together.  Was apprehensive about seeing this film. I love the director's ( Nora Ephron) books. Her blog about food & politics on Huff Post is awesome. That being said, her movies disappoint me.This one however, is a delightful exception.   As soon as I saw the scene were Meryl and Stanley Tucci are enjoying fish together , I was hooked. The pair of  them have great chemistry together. Stanley has a wry charm about him and Meryl nails Julia Child completely.   The cinematography was great. The color scheme and clothing makes you feel  like you are visiting France in the fifties. The food was beautiful. The boeuf bourguignonne made my mouth water and I don't even like beef. I craved bruschetta  so bad that I went home and made my own version .  I worked as a operator for a Help line for almost two years and could relate to Julie feeling crabby and unfulfilled in life. Chris Messina plays the kind of guy I should be dating,very funny ,supportive,but refuses to let Julie wallow in self pity. I liked that both these 2 couples found somebody who loved them through good and bad and helped push them to become even better.It gives me hope that I will find someone as well.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Cute story, yes, but a veritable smorgasbord for anyone who loves great dialogue.  Watch it once and enjoy it; watch it twice and get it; watch it another 10 times and wish your own life were so well worded.
B001HN697M|5.0|The third installment of the Underworld series is the best one yet.  The birth of the greatest lycan leader and the tale of the events that started the war.  Awesome effects, great acting and just a great movie.
031606792X|5.0|Of course we all know what a great series this is and part 4 doesn't disappoint.  Make sure to read parts 1-3 first.  Don't cheat.  Be on the lookout for the true heros of this tale - this book is about friendship, acceptance and cooperation once you look beyond the window dressings of monsters and vampirism.  Sexy characters, a few unexpected plot twists make this a good read for ages 13 to adult.  No explicit sex, although the experienced will recognize the references.
B0024RID60|5.0|I don't know what some of the other reviewers are listening to, but this is the first good sound CD issue of \\"Some Girls\\"; the limited edition '94 issues were superior sound except this LP, which was flat. Now I hear what I heard on that Holland orange vinyl copy I had, but some details are unearthed I never heard before. The 70s Stones albums were deliberately recorded to sound flat (after \\"Exile\\", can't wait to hear that remaster), Wyman complained about it - couldn't hear his bass it was so flat, but you wouldn't know it now. Should this have been done years ago by Virgin?, yes, should there be bonus tracks - \\"Everything's Turning to Gold\\", \\"Run Run Rudolph\\", and of course \\"Claudine\\", which was to be the key track (Miss Longet threatened to sue; as did Lucy, who got the cover banned after the first pressing). Yes. Will this sell as it should given that people, particularly in this economy, are tired of buying the same recording over and over again and is Jagger the most cynical capitalist ever to sing since Crosby? No and yes. But it's a great album and if you're not going to hunt down the original vinyl import pressing - and actually even if you are - it's the best release of this LP. Given that the Stones demos are usually superior (perhaps not in this case, this material is in no way overworked) maybe someday they will issue double CDs with the outtake alternates and demos - \\"Steel Wheels\\" and \\"Voodoo Lounge\\" are much better assembled from the penultimate takes; or so I hear.
B001D52XO2|5.0|In writing my latest book \\"A Failed State In Buckhead\\" my principle female character Amanda Reardon reflects on the importance of a Nina Simone concert in the transiton of a very white Southern women's transition into adulthood and how Ms. Simone re-introduced he into taking a chance of sensual lovemaking as a widowed single parent opening up to new found love.    As the tunes of Ms. Simone played through my head while I was writing of my character I realized that I have not updates my music collection of Nina Simone from wax to digital. Wow what a treat to have ordered and received the full collection of Nina Simone including a dvd of concert selections and an interview.     I have plans to purchase additional sets to pass on to my two adult children.    Bert
B0019LY5I2|3.0|I didn't expect much going into this and that's what I got. It was ok for what it was. If you can enjoy a movie without a plot and random mindless action, this will probably work for you better then it did for me. Not something I would see again or buy on DVD. Worth a one time showing at the movies if you can put up with no story, character development, and no real purpose to it. The CGI effects were the best part. I was hoping to see Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow fight and its in there but not that much. See it for the effects if nothing else. Its the type of movie I'll go see during the Summer and forget about later. 2 and 1/2 stars.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|This has much more violence and is not my idea of a super hero movie.<br />There is way too much blood and guts.  I am glad I missed it in the theater I wish I had not rented it.
B00284BMBM|4.0|I am by no means a fan of the live karaoke show American Idol. Most of the artists that goes on with a recording career comes off as your average cookie cutter pop/rock artist. I just don't think those artists will be remembered for much than other than being on American Idol. Even Kelly Clarkson's fame is starting to diminish in the last couple of years. Daughtry is the only artist I truly like and believes he has a good chance at having a career with the same longevity of say Bon Jovi.<br /><br />I recently bought LEAVE THIS TOWN after I heard someone blasting \\"No Surprise\\" from her car. I was hooked on this particular song right from the word go. As a whole, LEAVE THIS TOWN took a few listens for it to grow on me. I didn't think the album was as catchy as Daughtry's self-titled debut album. I did though liked the country ballad \\"Tennessee Line\\" with Vince Gill on back up vocals right away. Chris Daughtry's vocals is definitely perfect for country as it is for rock. Some music critics may have slammed on this song but I enjoy it immensely. I must say Chris's vocals have greatly improved on his sophomore album. He no longer sounds like Nickelback singer Chad Kroeger (whose music I am no fan of). His vocals are a bit more polished on the album. What drags down LEAVE THIS TOWN a bit is that a lot of the songs tend to sound the same. Asides from monotony, I enjoyed LEAVE THIS TOWN a lot.

B000009SFR|5.0|Tears for Fears seemed continually to be overreaching, writing overblown music with huge aspirations to profundity. However, they had the saving grace of seeming, paradoxically enough, sincere--they really were trying to say something, and you had to admire them for trying. Back when the media were preaching that American children were being scarred for life by the terrible psychological damage caused by the ever-present danger of nuclear annihilation, along came the Tears for Fears song, \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World,\\" the perfect anthem for the fear of nuclear annihilation: grandiose, overreaching, and a heck of a lot of fun to play in the car--and forgotten about as quickly as the whole \\"our kids are being driven nuts by nuclear fear\\" media mumbo-jumbo. It was really fun to hear this cut again--a great CD to play in the car and try to sing along with. It's the `80s all over again--cool!<br /><br /> The whole CD features big sound with big reverb, just a little murky but at least not grating or edgy. Songs from the Big Chair is a guilty pleasure both sonically and musically.
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens about 3 weeks ago, and I truely love it.. This is a great first lens for anyone or just a great lens to have, Prob the best all around for daily use (I don't take it off and change lens when I'm going places, it is the only lens I carry).

B000YGFGD6|5.0|One of the major regrets Michael Jackson often seemed to have was that his success never did manage to spill over into the silver screen the way that other 80's music stars such as Prince and Whitney Houston had. This presentation,released in 1988 is the closest he ever got. Released during the Bad tour and a huge period of all around success for him this presents Mike the artist in a very interesting period of transition. Of course as opposed to one whole movie this is more like a series of them-some longer and shorter than others. The themes that are explored in these....vignettes tend to have to do with children and paranoia,typical themes in Michael's career in general in the decade to come. First we are presented with a live rendition of \\"Man In The Mirror\\",interspersed with moving scenes from the music video.While Mike's performance is impassioned as always....I can't help but be reminded again of all the weird idolizing that seemed to be part of his own undoing;the scenes of fans panting at the mere sight of him and climbing over fences and whatnot. One of my favorite parts is a stop gap/clay animation presentation of Mike's early career with his brothers. Just a reminder this is 1988,before CGI was widely available so the animation has a highly organic look that I find personally refreshing. After that there's a quirky extended video for \\"Speed Demon\\" again involving claymation. There is a bit of a [[ASIN:B00007AJGH Who Framed Roger Rabbit]] flavor to it all;again the general focus is a sense of intense paranoia about his situation. The addition of a music video to \\"Leave Me Alone\\" of course is the ultimate flower of Mike's paranoia during the 80's. Something about the image of him as a giant human ammusement park gives you an idea that,at least at that point he did see his life as crazy and out of control. The conclusion of this presentation is an (almost) feature lengh movie based on \\"Smooth Criminal\\". Joe Pesci and Sean Lennon star in this.....spacious story that seems to be an homage to all the big budget films of the day-everything from [[ASIN:B0002H3S6O Benji]],[[ASIN:B000A2IPP0 E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial]] to....well [[ASIN:B000QQH4YS Robocop]] I guess.The anti drug message of the story and Mike's reactions to Joe Pesci's character's attempts to get children addicted to drugs has a sad irony to it too. Mike haters might see this as some form of egotism as he clearly paints himself as some superhuman hero to three young orphaned children. The video ends,aside from a brief appearance by Mike's manager Frank Dileo with an intense performance by Mike of \\"Come Together\\",complete with ripped shirt and all.During the credits Ladysmith Black Mombaza perform a version of \\"Smooth Criminal\\" so...every moment of the film is packed with some performance. High entertainment factor aside this shows more than anything Michael Jackson at the point where he was transitioning from being a musical superstar to becoming an idolized and often overly paranoid phenomenon.........an occurance that sadly led to something sadly fatal. But for a reminder of Mike at the height of his powers,before he let his eccentricities take total control over him this is a great place to go....spacious story that seems to be an homage to all the big budget films of the day-everything from [[ASIN:B0002H3S6O Benji]],[[ASIN:B000A2IPP0 E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial]] to....well [[ASIN:B000QQH4YS Robocop]] I guess.The anti drug message of the story and Mike's reactions to Joe Pesci's character's attempts to get children addicted to drugs has a sad irony to it too.

B00001QEE8|5.0|We are in our 60's and we found this a wonderful change from all the garbage on TV.. we laughed and enjoyed the movie very much.... You don't have to be a kid you know! Great music too.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I'm no Bondologist, and I don't want to be. I have seen maybe six or seven of the Bond films, and, as a whole have found them underpowering. I have not seen the latest Casino Royale, which Amazon reviewers have described as a strong prequel to Quantum of Solace. I do know that there is a wide range of quality in the 007 films; some are much better than others.    Although I approached this film with a cynical attitude, I did enjoy Quantum. I found it to be exciting. The stunts and special effects were well executed and quite realistic. According to Wikipedia, Daniel Craig, who portrayed Bond, suffered a busted dental crown and sliced the top off of one of his fingers during action scenes. Craig's Bond is more agile and acrobatic than the others; he scrambles catlike up and down the ledges of buildings and over barriers.     Combatants leap, cars crash, bullets fly, flames roar, and buildings explode. There's a spectacular air duel between a cargo plane piloted by Bond and a fighter jet. It seems that Bond and his lovely lady passenger are doomed...     As usual with the Bond films that I have seen, the plot is rather thin, and somewhat confusing. Of course, we have a dastardly villain who wants to destroy the world as we know it, and he has a motley crew surrounding him. In this film the villain, tepidly played by Mathieu Amalric, is a top operative for an international conspiracy that seeks to control a vital natural resource. He seems to be sleazier and less debonair than the typical Bond heavy.      Craig does yeoman's work and builds a character with which the audience can identify. He's clever and quick on his feet. He's a deadly marksman, master of the martial arts, and brutal street fighter. Just what we expect from Bond.
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|I was excited to see Wolverine Origins but as the movie went on I thought to myself another comic book movie that doesn't stick to itz origins.I mean you don't exactly have to follow the comic word for word, but atleast stay close to it, they put characters in the movie that didn't match up with the timeline in Wolverine's comics. And i do agree that the other 3 X-Men movies were good but they too didn't really follow the comic story. Cyclops was a weak leader, I think Halle Berry wasn't a good choice for Storm bad accent too. I know Wolverine is the most exciting character in X-Men but the other characters also have alot to bring to the team. I hope they remake the X-Men with the original 5 Iceman,Jean Grey,Cyclops, Beast, and Angel. And then gradually bring in other X-Men characters. All these comic movies need to stick to the comics in some form or manner. I know movie producers and writers try to be creative but damn there are somethings you shouldn't mess with.  '
B000FC0O7M|3.0|Good -- but not great read about early years of space flight.  Kranz had such a tremendous, front-row seat to the people and challenges of the day -- I was hoping for more stories and insights that we're not already part of our collective memories.  Gene Kranz is  truly an American hero and his accomplishments should make us all proud.  Where are the next challenges for our space program?
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|First, the good.  The tie ins to gameplay from Final Fantasy VII are a little more distinct in this version.  Some choices of music are more appropriate for some scenes, and the way the combat played out in certain scenes fits the story better.  The box says 26 more minutes of footage.  It feels like 45 minutes extra.  All very good things.    Bad:  I'm extremely picky regarding my Japanese to English subtitle translations.  Generally, the ones sold in the 'states are okay.  That is to say, a lot of the cultural referencing in the language gets roughly translated into something close to American verbage.  The result?  The dilly-dally shilly-shally scene.  If this sort of thing gets on your nerves, go find a fansub.  If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it.  Get this movie, it's terrific.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Surely, a large majority of those who have any interest in motion pictures but have not yet seen The Changeling still know the basics. In 1928 Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) fears that her son Walter has been abducted when she returns home from work and finds that he is missing. She is desperate and diligently does her best to find him. Five months later the police do find a boy who claims that he is Walter. But when Christine sees this boy she states that he is not Walter.     I had (mistakenly) thought since the film's release and after all the related publicity that this movie is built on a no-brainer concept, even though I knew that it is based on a true story.  I mean, a mother KNOWS who her nine-year-old son is. We are not talking mixing up babies at the hospital. So, I had little interest in it.    Well, I just watched the film. I can't conceive of anyone playing the Christine Collins role more effectively than Jolie. What a performance! A gripping tale unfolds about the mistreatment Christine received at the hands of a corrupt Los Angeles Police Department. The story of Walter's probable fate is emotionally devastating. As the credits rolled I felt stunned as I tried to sort through it all.      One reason I finally watched the film is Clint Eastwood's direction. His name means quality.    On a far less serious note, check out how Christine gets around on her job as a supervisor with the phone company!     I strongly recommend it, but I must point out that its very mature themes make it not suitable for children.
031606792X|1.0|It's hard to believe this book made it past proofreading and editing in this form.    The book is written for a late teen audience, but it reads like it was written BY the average member of that audience.    Clumsy phrasing, poor word choice, and basic mistakes in grammar and sentence construction all await the fortunate reader!    Oh, did I say the book was silly, too?    Just made for the movies!
B0017R5UAA|4.0|I had never heard of Fleet Foxes until I saw them one day on an old rerun of SNL. In today's riff raff of one hit wonder bands, sampling, looping over processed digital music my jaw dropped when I heard their music. First of all, if I wasn't watching the TV I would have thought I was listening to some un-realeased material from some classic progressive rock band of the past with a bit of a twist and some choral chant mixed in. Fleet Foxes sound is analog, organic, rich, warm and melodic. Wow. For those of you who remember albums you know what I mean when I say analog, warm and organic. It didnt have that generic thin sampled processed sound we are so use to hearing in todays music.    I have listened to Fleet Foxes The Album. Some songs grow on you others are just fabulous. It's fresh and exciting to know there are new young bands that can produce the sound and vibe that only the best classic bands of the past could muster which is a testament to their sound. Fleet Fox has the goods and I look forward to see how they evolve.    Sometimes it just nice to actually \\"listen\\" to the music like cinema for the ears versus just being able to dance to it.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I had bought this product at a store once, for twice the price. I got smart and came here to amazon.com and bought it for half the cost. Same great product, just didn't shell out as much dough.<br /><br />I love this headset because it molds to your head. It fits under my baseball cap and doesn't move, sending all the mp3 tunes into my head so I can tune out the world.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt my ears either, being soft plastic. I have tried other headsets that did hurt my ears, but this one doesn't and my ears appreciate that.<br /><br />They last a long time, but since I use them every day (work and play)they do wear out eventually. And that's why I buy several at a time, so I don't have to wait to replace them.<br /><br />They simply are the best headset I've ever bought. I would highly recommend them!
055380684X|1.0|A very general book with anecdotes about how building the myelin sheath has improved people's performance in various areas.  But this is not an instruction manual for showing YOU how to do the same with a skill important to your life.  I'm virtually certain Martha Beck won't be able to resist creating specific life-changing tools based on the general ideas presented here.  I was hoping this was going to be that kind of book - it isn't.

Swept along Route 66 in a jalopy carrying a dozen.  Enlightened by the cruel methods employed by the Oklahoma, Kansas and  California land owners.  Wanting, at the end, to read a sequel to find out what happened to Tom and the 300,000 other \\"Okies\\" who just wanted to work hard at what they knew best, farming.

In fact, I was a little concerned that I might not like it; I was thinking, \\"A ghost, are you kidding me?  This is crap.\\"  But you know what?  It was SO GOOD.  I enjoyed every minute of this book.  Highly recommended!  A fun read.  :)

B001OQCV9M|4.0|Julie Powell (Amy Adams) is a writer who can't finish anything. She's started her novel and only got half way through before giving up on it, and works in post 9/11 New York taking phone calls from people reeling from the tragedy. Julia Child (Meryl Streep) is a newlywed living in post-war France with her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) who works for the American Embassy. Julia is looking for something to give her life meaning she tries hat making, and bridge and loses interest in those fairly quickly. When she enters Le Cordon Bleu school of cooking she finds her passion in life.<br /><br />Julie and Julia is really two stories that run concurrently and mirror each other. When Adam's Julie decides to challenge herself to cook her way through Julia Child's famous book The Art of French Cooking she encounters obstacles and victories she might not have anticipated when taking on the project. Child's story is about how she overcame the obstacles of being an ambitious American in France after WWII. Learned how to cook and the struggle of writing and getting her book published. Both Julie's and Julia's stories are also love stories, each has a husband that is supportive to greater or lesser degrees. Tucci's Paul Child is unflaggingly supportive of his wife, and also very much in love with her. I grew up seeing Julia Childs cooking show on TV and she always struck me as being asexual, but for those who harbor similar opinions this movie will put that idea to rest. Julie and her husband Eric (Chris Messing) have a more modern relationship, and while Eric is supportive at times Julie's \\"meltdowns\\" get to him and they have arguments and he's not sure if he can take her mood swings.<br /><br />Streep is great as Julia Child, she has her character down pat and injects a lot of life and humor into Child. Stanley Tucci as Paul Child almost steals the show from Streep, he's madly love with Julia and he has almost as many good lines as Streep. Amy Adams is good as Julie Powell. Adams' Powell is very cute and not as confident as Child in the cooking, and has some very funny scenes. The scene where she has to cook live lobsters and she feels very guilty about it while the Talking Heads song Psycho Killer plays is hilarious. I somewhat enjoyed the Child/Streep story a little more, but that's just degrees, it may be the French setting and time seem more intriguing than Powell's/Adams contemporary setting. I would also like to mention Mary Lynn Rajskub's role as Julie's friend is an above average performance and caught my attention, it's a little more than your standard sidekick/friend role.cute and not as confident as Child in the cooking, and has some very funny scenes.

0316017922|4.0|Outliers: The Story Of Success is the latest book by Malcolm Gladwell, the author of [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]] and [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]], and focuses exclusively on the topic of what makes a person successful and another not. Gladwell is answering the question many have asked themselves, `why and how did he make it?' The answer is not as simple or romanticized as one would believe. It involves demystifying cult of personality.<br /><br />Outliers' lecture contends that to be successful the qualities needed go beyond one's choices or actions alone. One has to go beyond the particular person and look at outside factors like culture, community, occasions and where one is placed. Gladwell wants to correlate the health of the residents of the town of Roseto in Pennsylvania, for instance, to success factors in general despite the same residents' poor dietary choices. Why an `outlier' community (which is very healthy relatively) like Roseto can be an oasis of wellbeing teaches the rest of us things about why some are successful. The answer involves family and civics. Gladwell argues that deliberate and conscious choices are not everything, but sources of things, like origins, societal class as well as application make a difference. Should this method give us a blueprint for success then we can all make a difference early on.<br /><br />So Gladwell challenges our understanding of success and insists that success requires pushing, aiding and encouraging from one's parents, class, city/region of birth and that background is more important than the fabled ingenuity of the progeny who pulled more than his weight to reach the summit of success. It may not be a message of hope, but the author has come with examples and statistics. These include how the winter-born children do much better in the CHL and NHL (hockey leagues..) in droves by a margin. Why? Having met the cut-off date of January first, they are in groups that make them the bigger child, receive better coaching and more practice. It looks like, while the hockey players' ability is present, luck and the time of birth give them an advantage. Older children in a class perform better at school and later and therefore, societal choices are more pivotal than rules and individual talent. The same applies to individuals like Bill Joy who is celebrated for his work on the UNIX operating system and founding Sun Microsystems. Gladwell terms it the 10,000 Hour Rule where so much opportunity and practice, if available and possible, leads to success. He further goes on to insist that 10,000 is indeed the number of hours of practice needed to be not good, but a standout, at anything. Even Mozart, the supposed child progeny, wrote his first masterpiece after the age of twenty after so much practice. Here is the kicker: practicing for 10,000 hours on anything is improbable without active support and facilitation by one's parents. Society has a choice in how much talent it produces. These choices affect the productivity of a society and indeed a country.<br /><br />In this framework, Outliers relates the stories of The Beatles and Bill Gates, two diverse success stories. It turns out that luck and practice make perfect. Opportunity and circumstance come together and correlate with practice and later success. Except, one doesn't need just any luck. One needs extraordinary and unusual luck for the stars to align.<br /><br />The example of Christopher Langan, a certified genius with an IQ off the charts, in a chapter called The Trouble With Geniuses, again points to (in this case bad) luck and (lack of) opportunity. In this context, the book argues that thresholds, such as IQ scores beyond a level, are more important than comparative numbers and scores. Once one is in a high enough percentile all possible outcomes are available to one. The top scorer in a SAT examination is as good or as probable a success as the runner-up or number ten. A corollary is how one can be of `average' intelligence and still win the Nobel Prize for instance. Many Nobel Prize winners, turns out, are actually not that `intelligent.' Universities do many injustice as they churn out their top graduates to `the man' when these are actually no better in succeeding than lower scorers in absolute terms. Gladwell cites a study by sociologist Annette Lareau who proves that rich parents are involved, poor parents are not and hence poor children are easily intimidated by authority and do not gain a voice which gives them the chance to make it. The probability of success is pre-determined in that dividing line. Family matters because of the attention to grooming, coaching and acclimation to success. New York City Jews did not succeed in spite of their humble origins, but because of it. They had the right skills at the right time.<br /><br />In the second part of the book, Gladwell asserts that cultural legacies persist. One's ancestors' behaviours transmit themselves to the following generations. It is hence important to recognize and understand cultural legacies. The author uses commercial flights as an example to demonstrate how the operations by lower ranks is the better and safer way. Junior flight officers should not mitigate their expressions and behaviours with their supervisors, or in this case the head pilot. Rank is unimportant and one would do well to speak up!<br />An easier language (an important part of culture) in numbers and counting in Asian languages is a mitigating factor. This is the kind of inner (shall we say `institutional') advantage that helps Asians perform better in math. There is no IQ advantage. Since the numbers are easier to learn, they are easier to remember as a young child, making math simpler, more pleasant and so on. Over the years, this has become a shared trait. This shared circumstance is a perfect example of the impressive correlation between one's culture/legacy and success. Having said that, a criticism might aim at and ask how the above data and conclusions apply to those who are excluded. That is, would the reverse be true under scrutiny of numbers? Although, interesting insight is provided in this respect by surveying the chart on the world's richest men earlier in the book. Having said that, much of the book is not original science, but rather conclusions and compilations of others' thoughts.<br /><br />Culture, opportunities are domineering factors, in addition to subsequent persistence, in determining success. It is not all IQ and smarts or a rags-to-riches fable. Luck and circumstance cannot be denied. Give individuals , people and society the right tools, opportunities and a chance and watch the seeds yield fruit. Societies would do well to give as many as possible a leg up and the chance to seize success through provided circumstance and as much help as possible. The environment of the particular group though must be favourable to the task as well however. There is nothing especially innate otherwise about those we deem so gifted.r ten.

0142000671|4.0|I've always made a big deal about how much I do not like Steinbeck or Hemingway, but after reading a couple of both of theirs this year, I have to admit that I LOVE both.  As far as Steinbeck, I know that I still despise The Grapes of Wrath, but this is an incredible book.  Especially short and easy to read, the writing is simply superb.  The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is simple and to the point, and the descriptions are detailed.  This book deserves it's frequent consideration as a classic.  And while I still can't imagine ever liking GOW, I can no longer dismiss Steinbeck.

It seemed to focus too much on scientific area rather than SIMPLY telling what the stroke victim felt, so that comparisons could be made by readers who themselves had suffered strokes.  The author seemed personable and interesting in interviews, so the actual book was quite a letdown.

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|\\"NCIS: The Fourth Season\\" will delight fans with the entertaining mixture of tight police procedural and humorous team interaction they have come to expect.  This season will bring something extra, what exective producer Don Bellisario terms \\"a season of secrets.\\"<br /><br />The opening three episode story arc concerns the return of Senior Agent Gibbs from his hiatus in Mexico recovering from injuries, including partial amnesia, suffered at the end of Season Three.  Along the way, we will learn that Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David and acting team leader Tony Dinozzo have secrets from Gibbs.  In the course of the season, we will learn of Abby's secret romance and McGee's secret hobby.  Most importantly, we will learn of Director Shepard's secret vendetta against the arms dealer named Le Grenouille, for which she is prepared to bend and beak rules, and which will place Gibbs' team at risk by season's end.<br /><br />\\"NCIS: The Fourth Season\\" includes eight special features on the production of the show, of which the most entertaining may be a two-part roundtable with the cast.  The cast answers questions about the show put by viewers, and the viewers may come to appreciate just how well cast the show really is.  \\"NCIS: The Fourth Season\\" is very highly recommended to its fans.
B002DKGWSO|1.0|Without comparing or holding this up to the original, this film is a below average horror film that brings absolutely nothing new or exciting to the horror genre. It is well made and acted but with a budget over ten million, I should hope so.     If you are a die-hard horror fan with time to kill and are interested give it a rent.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|This was a buckle-yourself-in kind of wild ride. From the first scene when the men are arriving to the island to the final climax, this reader, while being handed clues and solving puzzles, had no idea where this book was headed and was unprepared for the final twist at the end.  It was full of interesting characters, unsettling atmospheres, vivid descriptions, and heartfelt emotions.<br /><br />This was the second Dennis Lehane book I've read.  It won't be the last.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|If I told you years ago that one of my favorite movies of 2007 would be a musical, I probably wouldn't even believe myself. If I told you that musical would be a slasher film directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, I definitely wouldn't believe myself. Oddly enough, that very scenario happened with Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.    The film-adapted from the Steven Sondheim play-tells the story of a London barber, wrongfully accused of a fake crime by a corrupt judge out only to steal his beautiful wife. The barber (obviously Depp) spends years in prison, finally escaping and returning to London on a sailing vessel to take his revenge on the judge (Alan Rickman) who ruined his life. He learns upon arrival that the judge essentially killed his wife and stole his daughter to raise as his own, so he'll have hell to pay when Sweeney Todd catches him.    Somehow, he gets mixed up with a very twisted and creepy meatpie maker, and the two begin an odd relationship of running a restaurant and killing people to solve the issue of the meat shortage. Todd slashes and cuts his way through victim after victim, all the while plotting his revenge and dreaming of the day the judge would become one of his creepy pseudo-girlfriend's pies.    The story isn't fantastic, but it's just odd and twisted enough to be catching. Based on an urban legend (which I learned via the special features) it's definitely a unique narrative. What really carries the film outside of Burton's presentation (grim and grey with a splash of blood thrown in) is the job well done by the actors in the movie. None of the main characters in the film (the barber, judge, henchman or pie maker) have a background in theatre or music, yet when it comes time to sing they carry a tune surprisingly well. Mixed in are several actual singers (and Sascha Baron Cohen himself), rounding out the cast in a nice way.    My main issue with the movie is in the songs themselves. While some are fantastic, toooften the singing resorts to what I like to call singsong narrative, as characters sing about what they're doing, or sing out normal conversations. There are only two songs in the entire movie which couldn't equally be said as speaking lines, and to me that hurts the musical aspect. If you're going to do a musical, why not go all out and focus on songs rather than just having characters sing instead of speak?    With the two disc special edition, there are plenty of features thrown in on the bonus disc. From the behind the scenes \\"Making this movie was fun!\\" reels to interviews, there's a little bit for everyone. The two most memorable pieces are the history of the story in Sweeney Todd and where it came from, and an interview with Sondheim as he explains the process of making the play into the film, and his thoughts on the finished project.    Overall, Sweeney Todd is by no means a perfect movie, but as far as musicals go it's a cut above the rest. (Totally unintentional.) The few real songs are catchy, and the atmosphere and setting of the movie will be in your mind for days. Just don't expect to eat any meatpies once you're done watching.         CONTENT: 4/5    The singing is good, and the film is great from a analytic standpoint. The only weak spots are the utter uselessness of several characters who serve as nothing more than a way to remind us of what Todd's plan is, and the lack of true, authentic songs. Isn't this a musical?      VIDEO: 4.5/5    Love him or hate him, you have to admit that Tim Burton has a style entirely his own, and that comes across brilliantly in Sweeney Todd. Usually with dark movies like this the DVD transfer is filled with grainy blacks or scenes just too dark, but Sweeney Todd is a near perfect transfer of the film, and there are no details lost in even the darkest of scenes.      AUDIO: 3/5    Can Johnny Depp and crew sing? Yes. Fantastic? Not really. Cohen does a great job as the (surprising) competitor barber, and the kid in the movie blows the rest of the cast ouf of the water.       EXTRAS: 2.5/5    There are plenty of them, but for the most part they're highly forgettable. A few gems, but the worthwhile parts could easily have fit on the single disc version. If you absolutely love musicals and want to know everything that goes into making one, you'll find some nice pieces to watch. Otherwise... Not so much.      REPLAY: 2.5/5    Some people can watch this over and over, and listen to the soundtrack on repeat for days. Personally, I can't see myself watching it more than once or twice over a very, very extended period of time. It just doesn't have any scenes or moments which stand up to repeated viewings like other films.       OVERALL:  3.5/5    Sweeney Todd is the best musical I've seen since Little Shop of Horrors, but it's pure rental material. Tim Burton took a nice shot at making the perfect Musical for Guys, but the DVD comes up short in several areas. Kudos for the attempt and for still coming out with a very watchable movie, but it's not quite as entertaining or long lasting as I originally hoped, and the extras in the two-disc special edition are definitely not worth the extra money. If you enjoyed Sweeney Todd or must buy it on DVD for whatever reason, I'd suggest saving your money and just picking up the regular edition.
0316789720|5.0|My son who is an artist commented recently that he wondered what had happened to his childhood Ed Emberly books. Thirty years and many moves later they were no longer around. His birthday was approaching so I ordered this book. He was totally delighted. He related that he credited much  of his early success in drawing from using the step by step forms to create more complex drawings. He also delighted in introducing his nieces to this drawing style. It was a great homecoming and a \\"pass the torch\\" moment from one generation to the next.

And there is history afoot, too. You can take it a step further and investigate and learn about the place where the main male character spent his early life.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I bought this cd just after MJ's passing, and have listened to it (in full) every day since then. Michael Jackson's creative talents are brilliant. The only track which I don't love is the \\"Beat It\\" re-mix with Fergie. Her voice just wasn't right (too deep), and she came across as a tough-guy wannabe. Akon's re-mix of \\"Wanna Be Starting Something\\" was great, so was the re-mix of \\"Billie Jean\\" with Kanye West. My favorite track on this cd is the last one, \\"For All Time\\"; it is a very tender song with a very positive message. Go buy this cd, you won't be disappointed.
B001AQMBL4|3.0|THE MOVIE    \\"We're going streaking!\\" Will Ferrell's frantic yelling, Luke Wilson's quiet acceptance of his life, and Vince Vaughn's adamant holding-on to being a partying bachelor made Old School a comedy classic when it came out just a few short years a go. In the vein of Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds, the story focused on an unlikely group of guys on a college campus: grown up men who aren't even going to the school.    The story begins when Mitch (Wilson) loses his cheating girlfriend. His friends, Frank (Ferrell) and Beanie (Vaughn) hatch a plan to get career-oriented Mitch back into the social world; they rent him a house on-campus, and turn it into the most high-profile fraternity (complete with Snoop Dogg concert) around.    Compared to every other college-oriented comedy since the 80s, Old School was a breath of fresh air. The film finally seemed to realize that there's more to humor than gross-out jokes and physical humor, combining drama, likable characters, and memorable scenes all with the type of humor people have come to expect from a movie starring Will Ferrell. Putting the emphasis on a man in his 30s who's not even in college also is a fresh move, as it allows for exploring more than just getting good grades, or fitting in with peers. Thanks to Mitch's age and current status, Old School is not only a movie about the college frat life, but also about mid-life in general. What would a real 30-year-old man do if he found himself in Mitch's shoes, homeless with a new frat house, girl-less with dozens of sorority sisters throwing themselves at him, and friends trying their hardest to live like they were still young and not married? Most likely, they'd do exactly what Mitch does.    Old School may not be as funny as other films by its stars, but it's still a fantastic movie full of humor, memorable moments, quotable lines, and lovable characters. The trio of Vaughn, Ferrell, and Wilson offer some of their best performances here, and it's a treatto watch again and again.    Score: 4/5          THE DISC       Old School is one of those movies filmed for high-def transfer before it became a standard, so while the transfer is high-def, it's not quite at a level as other films since then. The 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 encode looks, to my eye, almost identical to the HD DVD release Old School originally saw. Compared to the DVD, there's a better clarity to textures and more noticeable details, but nothing that will blow you away going, \\"Wow, this is the power of Blu-ray!\\"    For a comedy movie like Old School that has no huge catalog of action scenes or graphically impressive feats, the transfer is a solid one. It's much better looking than the DVD, but once again, nothing you'd want to show off your home theater set-up with.    Unlike the video, the audio in the Blu-ray release is an improvement over the HD DVD version as it offers TrueHD 5.1 surround. Unfortunately, the surround is very rarely noticed given it's a dialog-heavy movie that is, once again, light on the effects. Only during a few scenes (the first party; the competition at the end; the classic fight between Mitch, Frank and the Dean) is the surround actually noticeable without looking for it.    One area where the disc suffers is in the features department. With all of the DVD releases of Old School over the years, it looks like DreamWorks just didn't have anything new to bring to the plate. (And, to make matters worse, all features are in standard definition.) If you've already cleared the features on your DVD release(s) of the film, you'll find nothing new to take your time here. What is here is still entertaining, but it looks like they're officially dried up.    For those who don't own one of the DVD releases, Old School on Blu-ray contains an audio commentary featuring Vaughn, Ferrell, and Wilson (along with director Todd Phillips). The commentary isn't something for film students, as most of the stars' time is spent riffing on one another than discussing the film, but if you're a fan of MST3K or any of the three actors involved, chances are you'll like it.    The other features are a little more entertaining for all audiences. First, there's the obvious deleted and extended scenes collection. With 8 scenes and 13 minutes of runtime, there are a few gems hidden on here. To go along with those, there's a 5 minute outtakes and blooper real. Oddly enough, compared to many it's rather lackluster. Perhaps the best (actually, it IS the best) feature on the disc is the Inside the Actor's Studio spoof with Will Ferrell reprising his SNL role of James Lipton. In it, \\"Lipton\\" interviews Vaughn, Ferrell, and Wilson about Old School. If you've ever seen Will's SNL skits with the overanalytic windbag that is Lipton, you'll love this.    Score: 2.5/5      VERDICT    In the end, whether or not you buy Old School on Blu-ray depends on several questions. Do you already own the movie on DVD? If you do, is it worth the price to upgrade to Blu-ray for HD picture? And if you don't, is HD picture and audio important enough to you that you'll spend $20 instead of picking up a used/new copy of the DVD for under $10? If you don't mind spending the extra cash, Old School is a great movie and the Blu-ray transfer is a very serviceable one. For most people, though, a film of this type with no new Blu-ray extras to speak of will likely be good enough on DVD with upscaled presentation.     Overall Score: 3/5

B001AIRUOU|5.0|It's hard to believe the first DVD release of Nightmare Before Christmas came out over 8 years ago, and that the movie itself is almost 16 years old. I still remember seeing it for the first time (despite complaints from my friend's parents) and falling in love with Jack Skellington and Tim Burton's bizarre new world. A musical about Christmas? Who cares! A musical about Christmas from the point of view of Halloween's monsters? Who wouldn't want to see that?    As everyone knows by now, Nightmare Before Christmas has withstood the test of time, becoming one of the most popular (and most beloved) movies of all time, and easily the biggest stop-motion film of all time and the pinnacle of the craft. So with the new release of the movie and the two-disc collector's edition, it was an easy choice to put it on my list and hope Santa didn't find me naughty.    For the three people who haven't seen the movie, Nightmare follows Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. After yet another drab Halloween, Jack wanders off to a forest he has never seen before, finding a strange array of trees. Opening several, he ultimately finds himself in different worlds; Christmas world is the one resonating most with the dejected skeleton.    This \\"Christmas World\\" is so different from Halloween Town, Jack can't help but fall in love with it. Spying on its populace, he takes notes and returns to his home where he instructs the other denizens of Halloween Town that this year they won't do Halloween-they'll do Christmas!    What follows is an entertaining mix of humor and music as the ghouls, ghosts, and ghastlies of Halloween Town prepare for Christmas, and ultimately try to wrestle control from Santa Claus himself.    Unlike other re-releases, Burton and Disney didn't just release this to make a quick buck. (Okay, they did, but they also made that buck worth it.) For starters, the case is easily one of the coolest I've ever seen. What you can't tell from looking at pictures on Amazon is how big it is, and that it's in 3D. Opening like a book, the case is twice as thick as a normal DVD case, and the picture of Jack on the cover isn't a picture at all, but a pop-out 3D carving of everyone's favorite skeleton.    The contents inside contain awesome goodies for fans, too.    One of the special features shows Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour at Disneyland. For those unlucky enough to grow up outside of Southern California, this feature shows how the Disney Imagineers transform the Haunted Mansion ride at Christmas to relate to Jack Skellington and Nightmare, and offers several views and audio tracks ranging from how riders see it in-person, to the behind-the-scenes events which make it possible. It's a rare look into the background of one of the world's most storied theme park attractions, and worth a watch if you're interested in anything Disney, Nightmare, or engineering.    In addition, there are Making Of featurettes (so much work goes into this movie...) and Tim Burton's own presentations on a variety of subjects. We have the reading of the original Nightmare Before Christmas poem complete with animation, two Tim Burton shorts (Frankenweenie and Vincent), deleted scenes, gallery pictures, concept art, and much, much more.    Disney certainly didn't take the easy way out. This set is packed with extras fans will love (I don't think I've ever watched as many extras willingly as I did with this), a fantastic digital remastering, and the best DVD case ever. If you're a fan of the movie and already own Nightmare on DVD, this is-without a doubt-worth the double dip. Pick this one up, and donate your old copy to some kids who haven't yet experienced the masterpiece.      Content - 5/5    A classic. One of the greatest Christmas movies ever made, and one of the greatest non-live-action movies of all time. The soundtrack will be stuck in your head for years, and Jack Skellington will be stuck in your heart forever. There's a reason this was already one of the biggest DVD releases of all time, and this new edition will certainly add on top of that.    Video - 4.5/5    Not quite as nice as the Blu-Ray release, but a great improvement over the original DVD. Nothing was lost in this remastering; only gained. If you don't own an HDTV and a Blu-Ray player, this is the best Nightmare will ever possibly look. The detail on the dolls pops out, you can see all the expressions flawlessly... It just looks good.     Audio - 5/5    \\"What's this!?\\" One of the most addictive soundtracks of all time with an improved audio, that's what. 5.1 surround with a nice mix, the songs and world of Halloween Town have never sounded better.    Replay - 5/5    I know many people who watched their original Nightmare DVD so much it was wearing out. This will easily replace those, but with the new bevy of features you may need to re-buy down the road once the DVD player stops recognizing the disc from wear. Then again, this comes with a digital copy so you're probably good. Watch it every Christmas, watch it between Christmas, watch it whenever. Nightmare Before Christmas is always good.     Overall - 5/5    If I could go higher than a 5, I would. Nightmare Before Christmas is a true classic in cinema, and this Collector's Edition offers so many new features and improvements on the original DVD release from 8 years ago that it's a must-buy for any movie fan, even if it means you're going to double dip.

B001HN69AE|2.0|THE MOVIE     Like many, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z served to not only entertain me as a child, but also introduce me to the world of anime and martial arts. Goku, Piccolo, Roshi, and the rest of the crew were on the TV in our living room at least two days a week, and my friends and I would engorge ourselves on any and all things DB -- from official toys to unofficial translated ROMs of GameBoy and NES games that had little to do with the actual shows we had watched.    So when Dragonball Evolution was announced as a live action movie, and when the casting began to be revealed, to say I was worried would be an understatement. I had seen so many other classic shows and series ruined by modern movie remakes... But DBZ!? \\"Wait until it comes out,\\" everyone would say. \\"Maybe it will be decent!\\"    Well, in a way, they were right.    If you watch the film expecting a remake of DBZ, or even a retelling of that story, you're going to be horribly disappointed. For some of you, that's going to result in lengthy posts on IMDB about how this differs from the original cartoon. If you watch this and pretend it's a standalone thing not connected to the shows, though, it's actually pretty campy fun. Fantastic? By no means. Entertaining? Absolutely.    Yes, the story is full of plotholes and the acting makes SyFy movies look like big-budget Oscar nominees. But, like GI Joe and many, many other movies before it, Dragonball Evolution is not a movie to watch when you want something to think about; it's the movie you put on in the background while you do things, or watch with a large group of friends.    As a film, Dragonball Evolution is awful. The pacing is odd, it's riddled with cliches, and it's pretty obvious that the director didn't quite understand what some of the finished special effects shots were going to look like judging by some of the angles. But as entertaining, Dragonball Evolution isn't bad. Watch it with a big group of friends, make fun of it as you notice the godawful elements, and enjoy the moments of fast-paced action and cheesy special effects.    If you're a lover of classic cinema, ignore this movie. But if you're a lover of \\"so bad they're awesome\\" films like Plan 9, Manos, and The Room, then Dragonball Evolution is definitely one to check out.        THE DISC      - Audio and Video -    Like the movie itself, the visuals in Dragonball Evolution are a very mixed bag. On one hand, the AVC MPEG-4 encode (1080p, 2.40:1 OAR) looks great when it comes details like clothing, sand, pepples, broken glass, and other small, intricate items. Skin colors also look great -- starting out. About halfway through, it seems like the hue of skin will shift slightly from time to time. It's a subtle shift, but if look closely or jump a few chapters ahead after the first two, you'll probably notice it.    Blacks are also fairly bright, which gives the entire film a warmer, brighter looking appearance, even in its darkest moments. The green screen special effects shots also vary wildly, with some looking fantastic, and near demo quality -- and others looking like they're from a Shaw Bros. film.    Overall, however, the video in Dragonball Evolution is well above average, proving that at least part of the movie was well made.    The audio, however, steals the show. (Not hard to do when it's really only competing against the video...). Evolution sports a DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless soundtrack, and it sounds great from beginning to end.    Bass is just booming enough to make you feel it, but not so much that action scenes drown out the speech. (Although, that may have been a good idea...) Music is strong, and the surround sound placement makes perfect sense for the action on-screen.    In terms of the A/V, Dragonball Evolution is a great release. It's just too bad that the movie they gave the technical team to work with happened to be this one...       - Extras -    As expected, the extras here are bare minimum, and not really creative at all. Thereare the required deleted scenes, blooper reel, and behind-the-scenes look at the making of Evolution. The lengthiest extra is a 25 minute interview with star Justin Chatwin (Goku), talking about his career, playing Goku, and everything you'd expect someone promoting a movie to talk about.    There's only one real Blu-ray exclusive, and that's an extra called \\"Goku's Quest,\\" which you need to unlock by pushing a button on your remote each time a dragonball shows up in the film. It's annoying to watch the movie holding a remote, and the pay-off isn't worth it at all. The Blu-ray also comes with a digital copy of the movie, in case you want to play a prank on your film school friend by loading this onto his Macbook while he's busy sipping tea at a coffee shop.       - Verdict -    As a remake of Dragon Ball Z, Dragonball Evolution falls flat in every regard. As a \\"film,\\" Dragonball Evolution falls flat in every regard. But as mindless entertainment, and a movie that any fan of MST3K would enjoy, it's perfect. Watch it with a big group of friends, have some drinks, and make fun of it. And if you do watch it, the Blu-ray version is the one to go with, as the video and audio are far superior to the DVD. Hell, it's so good that it almost makes the movie look better simply by association.      Movie Score: 1 / 5  Disc Score: 4 / 5  Overall Score: 2 / 5

B0011NVC9I|5.0|Anyone who knows me has heard me rant in regards to last year's Beowulf. A huge fan of the original epic (I've done several papers on it) and an even bigger fan of Neil Gaiman's work, I was looking forward to the movie more than anything else in its timeframe of release. Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver.    The story of Beowulf is simple enough, and anyone who has taken a middle school English class knows how it goes, so I won't bore you with the details. Suffice it to say that Beowulf is a big bad warrior full of talk, and through a series of events finds himself killing the monster Grendel. Told that he now has to slay Grendel's mother--the last monster--Beowulf sets off, but finds that it's not as easy as it sounds and is seduced by the promise of everlasting glory and riches. Years go by, and Beowulf's land continues to prosper, until finally in his old age he's forced to confront the monster he succumbed to long ago in order to save himself and his people.    It's the most traditional of the hero archetypes, and Gaiman did an admirable job of adapting it to film. In the same regard, though, Beowulf is a film that just can't possibly capture our imagination after hearing the original tale. The imagery in the epic isn't fleshed out enough (like Lord of the Rings) to easily translate to the screen, and thus our mental imagery of Beowulf's journey will forever be the truest one.    That being said, Beowulf is still a good movie, and the most impressive visual specimen I've ever seen. Zemeckis went above and beyond any CGI film to date, and Beowulf is so close to being real that many people will swear it is even after knowing it was CGI. (My friends didn't know it was animated from the trailers until I told them it was when we went to see it.) It's a poetically beautiful event that the oldest English tale is now the newest technological feat in film. In addition to being breathtaking eyecandy, the Beowulf DVD features some of the better special features I've seen in quite a while. After watching DVDs like Death at a Funeral and other recent movies with special features consisting purely of a gag reel and trailers, it's a breath of fresh air.    Most of the special features are short (only two are longer than 5 minutes), but they all provide a pivotal look into the world behind the movie, and the technology behind the film. There's a thing to educate people on Beowulf, The Art of Beowulf, and a short feature on designing the creatures featured in the film. Most importantly, though, is A Hero's Journey: The Making of Beowulf. This documentary showcases how they made the film, and the painstaking methods behind it. Anyone considering animated films child's play will do well to watch this featurrette. The mocap sessions are awesome, and seeing the actors realize that they'll have to not only read their lines -- but act them out -- for virtual characters is priceless.    One thing I'd like to note at the end of this review is the uncensored director's cut portion of the DVD. While watching the movie I noticed absolutely nothing new or changed from the theatrical release I saw twice. A friend claimed that a scene or two was a few seconds longer, but I'm still not too convinced. If you expect tons of extra scenes and carnage, look elsewhere, because this is more or less the movie as seen in theaters last year.      CONTENT - 2.5/5    The movie itself is mediocre at best. As an exercise of technological achievement it's fantastic; as a modern take on the classic Beowulf tale it's no better than Beowulf vs. Grendel.      VIDEO - 5/5    Is it as amazing as seeing it in 3D? Nah. Of course not. It's still the most impressive animated feature I've ever seen though, bar none. The CGI is breathtaking, and it's astounding how far we've come since Toy Story. If you haven't seen it, check Beowulf out to at least see the future of filmmaking and where we'll be going.      AUDIO - 5/5    The 5.1 sound is breathtaking, even if the voice acting isn't that great. Beowulf truly is an audio and visceral treat to behold for fans of films or those with a big TV and speakers set up.      EXTRAS - 4/5    The documentary behind the making of Beowulf is great, and the rest is good enough. When you get a documentary good enough to watch even if you didn't enjoy the movie, that's when you know you've done a good job.      REPLAY - 2.5/5    If you love it, you'll watch it again, much like I've watched 300 several times already. For most people though Beowulf is a once-and-done treat, watched for the advance in movie technology and ignored later for the lack of a good coherent narrative compared to the source material.      OVERALL - 4.5/5    The movie is lacking, but everything else about the Beowulf DVD more than makes up for it. Awesome video and audio, awesome extras, and spectacular computer animation make an otherwise TV-only movie worth at least a rent. For fans of 300 and other similar movies, this is a must-own.
B0013POLS8|1.0|She lost her voice!!! So Sad!!!<br />Nothing else to say more than recommending to you not to buy this trash...
B001794FOK|4.0|I remember really looking forward to Jumper when the teaser and initial previews came out. Then, suddenly, the movie was there in front of me on Blu-Ray, and to say I was only a little disappointed would be an understatement.    Rather than the big action ride I anticipated, Jumper is instead a showcase for digital effects, camera work, and the power of HD. The movie focuses on people called \\"jumpers,\\" who are able to teleport. The main character of the film, played by Anakin himself, does what most people would do if they found themselves given such great power: use it for his own gains.    Most people will claim if they could teleport they'd use it for good, but let's be honest: a majority of you would use it the same way David Rice does: teleporting to rob banks, but mostly just using it to travel the world instantaneously and fulfill his own cravings. Want Chinese from China? You got it. Want to surf in Fiji but also have a one-night stand in London? You got that, too.    Thankfully, the movie isn't just David Rice partaking in vices. Alongside the jumpers, there's a group known as the Paladins, which (if you've ever played any games or D&D) you can guess are religiously based. Led in the film by Samuel L Jackson, the Paladins make it their duty to extinguish the jumpers, believing only God should have the ability to be anywhere at once.    Throw in the cliché girlfriend childhood love interest, and the stranger who seems bad at first but obviously ends up \\"good,\\" and you've got Jumper. It's an action film filled with great scenes and spectacular camerawork, but outside of SLJ there's little positive when it comes to performances (and even he seems to have phoned this one in), and even less positive when it comes to plot, development and a sense of closure at the end. There will obviously be a Jumper 2, so we'll have to see if they can do a better job with that one.    In terms of the Blu-Ray transfer, Jumper is one of the best discs yet in terms of visual quality. Coming in at 1080p with a 2.35:1 framed image, the film looks much, much better than the plot showcases. Colors are crisp, and several scenes look outright realistic. If you have an HDTV and don't mind the mindless action films from the 80s and earlier, give Jumper a try, if for no other reason to see how awesome films like Predator would have been with this quality of picture.    Everything else about Jumper is so-so. The audio is 5.1 but never too outstanding (or too poor), and the extras do the job but little above their requirement. Featured are obvious ones such as the making of the film (which I admit does do a better job than some), a look into the special effects process, and another look at adapting the novel into the film, which is my favorite piece. No matter what you take out of Jumper, it will likely make you interested in author Steven Gould's original book. Take solace in knowing the book is (like usual) much better than the film.      CONTENT: 2/5    Jumper is a popcorn flick, plain and simple. You won't talk about it after you watch it, and chances are you won't remember it two years from now. Watch it for some mindless entertainment, and expect nothing more. Sometimes, that's more than enough.      VIDEO: 5/5    One of the best Blu-Ray transfers I've seen. It stands up proud with Narnia and the other fantastic video achievements. Scenes look real, the effects are amazing, and the colors are perfect. If you want to show off Blu-Ray to friends or family, this is the disc to use.      AUDIO: 3/5    5.1 (which is the average these days), but nothing stands out. There's no real loud action, but nothing falters. The effects sound nice, and the music is decent, but, overall, Jumper's audio is completely middle of the road.      REPLAY: 1/5    If you watch movies with friends to go all MST3K style, this one has much higher replay. Alone, however, you'll watch it once then likely forget about it. Unless, of course, you want to marvel at the technical achievements on your HDTV.      EXTRAS: 3.5/5    The extras you'd expect from a big budget film. The most memorable is a look into the adaptation process, and that will hopefully lead more people to the book (and other books in the future!).      OVERALL: 3.5/5    As a movie itself, Jumper is probably only a 1.5 or a 2. With the Blu-Ray presentation, video, and others, however, it's a much better BRD than it is a movie. It's spectacular looking which makes the haphazard plot and shoddy acting bearable, and that's saying a lot for how nice the movie looks. If you have an HDTV, you may want to at least rent this just to see how nice it looks. Whether or not you buy, however, depends on your tolerance of mindless, poorly structured action movies. Basically, 80s action fans will dig it.
B0026NWBY2|1.0|The only song on this complitation that is worthwile is \\"I Don't Want To Do It\\" as it was a one off for the Porky's Revenge soundtrack CD.  Everything else is available.
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|THE SEASON    A lot of TV shows suffered from the writer's strike last season. Some, like Scrubs, had awful shortened seasons that seemingly cried out, \\"I give up!\\" Others, like Lost, went with the flow, and managed to deliver not only what fans expected (even if it was slightly different than originally planned), but some of the best work yet in the franchise.    Before the fourth season of Lost began, it was announced that the show would end after six seasons, with a definitive ending. (Or so they claim!) This timetable put the entire series of Lost into a scheduled progression, which the strike threw off. The result? Lost lost several episodes in the fourth season, but the talent of the writing staff managed to put out a slightly shortened season that still hit all the major points needed for the show to progress, even if we did lose out on some extra character progression and events.    The fourth season of Lost was big for more than being the first filmed with a set-in-stone finale in sight. At the end of season 3, Jack has a flash-forward, going against the previous structure (and identity) of the show. This continues in season 4, as characters no longer flash-back to their past and what they did before they got to the island, but flash-forward to (in some cases) life after the island.    This may seem like a cop-out in showing who will make it off and soliciting fan feedback, but in reality it actually greatly changed things. Why? Because some people don't make it off the island. Now, the story of Lost isn't the same ol' \\"How do they got off the island? Do they get off the island?\\" routine from the last three years, but instead, \\"Why does so-and-so not make it?\\" Do they stay around? Do they die? Does the group split even further, resulting in some escaping while they leave others behind? Suddenly, Lost regains a whole lot of depth that went missing after the relatively tame second year.    The story itself picks up right where season 3 left off, with the gangmaking contact freight ship crew just offshore, and a helicopter sent to pick them up. Obviously, things don't go according to plan as the freighters have their own agenda.    The usual twists and turns (and new character introductions) that fans expect from the series are in full force in season 4. Even though the post-strike episodes feel a bit more rushed and more compacted with events than the pre-strike ones, they still feel like Lost and manage to pacify fans, which is something many shows couldn't do in the WGA strike period. My only complaint about the season is that, compared to the previous three, the finale isn't nearly as big of a revelation. Then again, maybe that's part of a new direction for Lost, too.         THE BLU-RAY DISC      Lost Season 4 is called \\"the expanded experience\\" on the case, even though it's basically exactly what you saw on TV. That's not the only puzzling feature of the package, either. One of the Blu-ray specific features, SeasonPlay, allows you to keep track of where you are in the season and go directly back to that point. (Since, you know, Blu-rays don't save virtual bookmarks like DVDs.) Unfortunately, it rarely seemed to work as-intended. Another puzzling item is the episode selection menu. Pick that, and it asks you to select which disc you have in. But... shouldn't it be able to tell? The best part is if you accidentally pick the wrong one, it tells you to insert the right disc. Odd.    Those issues aside, Lost season 4 on Blu-ray is fantastic, and a great example for TV show releases in the future. Presented in 1080p instead of the HD broadcast's 720p quality, Lost on Blu-ray is noticeably better than Lost on TV; even on the HD channels. Colors are bright, the jungles of Hawaii (err-the \\"island\\") look fantastic, and the blacks are deep and foreboding. The show also offers one of those awesome-but-oh-so-rare 3D-like effects during the jungle scenes, where the picture is so clear you almost feel like you're there.    If Ihave one complaint, it's that the transfer may be too clear. Plenty of times, you can see makeup and such on the faces of the actors due to the high clarity. On one hand, it's a testament to the quality of the transfer. On the other, nothing takes you out of the moment and scene faster than noticing Jack has some foundation on his cheek.    The PCM 5.1 audio is also a great improvement over broadcast quality. Which is impressive, considering the broadcast quality of Lost's audio is already above just about all TV Blu-ray releases. Presented with full surround and in several languages, the score, ambient sounds of the island, and action of the occasional action break are very clear, bump quite well, and will please even the most hardcore of audiophiles.    The extra's list, like the previous seasons, is full of hours of goodies. Audio commentary on several episodes, a witty 8:15 recap of the previous Lost seasons, Lost on Location, Lost in Hawaii, the Right to Bear Arms, and the regular bloopers, outtakes, and deleted scenes make the bulk of the featurrettes list.    Exclusive to the Blu-ray version are SeasonPlay, which I've already mentioned, excerpts from a live performance of the fantastic Lost score by the Honolulu Symphony Pops Orchestra, and, my favorite feature, Course of the Future. Course of the Future combines the flash-forwards from season 4, and makes them-effectively-one future episode. While on the standard DVD release, on Blu-ray fans can follow specific characters, finding out what (so far) will happen with some of their favorites. Combined all of the flash forwards fill up an entire episode's timeslot, so it's quite an entertaining watch. Footage you've already seen? Sure. But fun to watch again without any switching back-and-forth between time periods? You bet.       FINAL WORD    Lost Season 4 on Blu-ray is, as I've already said, a pinnacle and shining example for TV on Blu-ray. The show's producers know how to film for the format, and it shows. An awesome video and audio transfer, some nice Easter eggs, and more make up the best Lost season 4 package available. While I would have loved to see more Blu-ray specific features, just having all the extras from the DVD in high-def format is enough of a bonus.    If you're a fan of Lost, buy this season on Blu-ray. And, if you're new to the series, season 4 is perfectly able to serve as a starting point thanks to the new flash-forward dynamic. So if your friend/loved one is watching it, feel free to jump in. Just expect to be hooked on the show like most of America, and join the long list with those of us asking for a Blu-ray release of the first two seasons to add to our collection.       The Show: 5/5  The Disc: 4.5/5  Overall: 5/5
B000PY52EU|5.0|A very hot, steamy video. Very good acting and a hot, humid atmosphere. Well worth watching. A keeper. The music is great, and Ricci and Jackson do a great acting job.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|There Will Be Blood was one of the more surprising movies of last year. What initially struck me as a boring, pointless film thats only saving grace was Daniel Day-Lewis playing a character he already played later turned into one of my favorite movies. It's something you need to watch more than once to appreciate, as all of the magnificence of the movie comes in the form of all the little, unheralded aspects.    The movie tells the tale of an oil man named Daniel Plainview in early 20th century America as he thirsts for more money and power, received in the form of controlling oil. There are many characters in the film who are important to the work as a whole, but the entire movie is very clearly placed in the (obviously) capable hands of Daniel Day-Lewis.    Over the course of the American epic, Plainview meets and loses people, finds and loses things, and ultimately begins to question the very essence of humanity. No single moment in the film stands out as the pinnacle of Plainview's realization; rather the entire movie slowly works in a crescendo until you understand what he's seeing and going through.    The main conflict comes in the form of Plainview and a holy man named Eli. Eli's twin brother sells Plainview the location of an oil rich area of California, and Eli convinces the town and church to allow Plainview to dig on the condition that he donates a portion to the church. (But are his motives truly that honorable? You'll have to watch and see.) The two continue to fight as Plainview refuses to pay, and it leads to one of the best confrontations between two characters I've seen in quite a while.    The last third of the movie does struggle at times, but in my mind the ending portion is much, much better than what No Country left us with. Some will say There Will be Blood has no real ending and cops out, and to them I say: watch the movie again. Buy it on DVD, pay attention to the characters and their body language, and pay special attention to Plainview through the course of the movie. The end may not be the greatest end ever, but it is there, and the slow breakdown of Plainview from a giant among men to an emotionally crippled, instable, lonely man is brilliant to watch.      CONTENT: 5/5    There Will Be Blood was my choice for the best (American) movie of 2007, and after my fourth time watching it it still is. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of the decade as Daniel Plainview, and even if the rest of the film hadn't been this fantastic, it would still be a movie worth watching and owning just to see him do his thing. Amazingly, we get a movie that supports Day-Lewis in his larger than life role, and which was completely robbed by the Coens at the Oscars.      VIDEO: 4/5    You get the widescreen presentation of the film enhanced for 16:9 TVs, and there's almost no color loss from the theater. While it would have been awesome to have in HD, it looks great for a standard DVD. Blacks are dark, and there's no real issues with darker scenes on tube TVs.      AUDIO: 3.5/5    The surround presentation could have been used to a greater extent, but it still sounds good. With English, French and Spanish 5.1 support, you'll be hard-pressed to find someone who can't appreciate the movie. Of course, hearing Daniel Plainview in French isn't quite the same, but still.      REPLAY: 4/5    Is it long? You bet. Can you watch it again? Definitely. The sign of a truly great picture is that you can view it repeatedly, and There Will Be Blood passes that test. The little interactions and often unseen things which pass between characters are picked up upon in succeeding viewings, and Daniel Plainview is amazing every time.       EXTRAS: 3/5    Sadly, the second disc doesn't offer that much with There Will Be Blood. I was hoping for more given the nature of the film--and what we get is solid--but there's just not enough. There's a short historical documentary, \\"The Story of Petroleum,\\" which is the meat and potatoes of the extras,but aside from that nice little view into America's past, the disc is lacking. There's no commentary from Paul Thomas Anderson--or anything including him in the special features--and that strikes me as incredibly odd. There is a nice bit which shows (briefly) how Day-Lewis created the Plainview persona over time, but again, too little for the epic they're supposed to supplement.       OVERALL: 4.5/5    Is the special edition a little weak? Yup. Is the case a little odd? Yup. (It's a cardboard sleeve case, in case you were wondering.) Still, There Will Be Blood is one of the best movies of the century, and easily the best of 2007. Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of the most memorable performances in movie history, and the rest of the movie is much better than you initially think. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up so you don't miss out. If you have seen it and thought it was overrated, rent the DVD, give it a re-watch, and then make your conclusion. There Will Be Blood is an American epic in every sense of the word, and Paul Thomas Anderson seemingly did the impossible by outdoing himself.
B000PAAH3K|2.0|I got the book because of the number of reviews. I started reading it and I didn't get the first part so I continue until I got to the middle. Nothing special. Just a lot of research from the author but nothing I can really take and use. It was a waste of my money and time. I don't know if I need to get to the end to really understand the value of the book but currently in the middle of it I am bored and I don't want to continue. So I decided to stop and got another book. I hope I am wrong and I hope there is something else that I am missing. Maybe I will give it another try later this year but currently I am very disappointed with this book.
B000V86OKG|5.0|When I first heard about Dexter, I had no idea what to make of it. A show about a killer who works with the police killing killers for killing? That people liked? Sounded like a complete Hot Topic crowd pleaser. Then, I watched season one. And season two. Twice. Suffice it to say, Dexter is now my favorite non-Supernatural show on television, and possibly one of the greatest shows in recent memory.    No small order when you look at other recent mega-hits.    The show centers around the titular Dexter Morgan, played brilliantly by Michael C. Hall. The first season found Dexter tracking (and ultimately killing) the infamous Ice Truck Killer, so what happens from there? Thankfully, rather than approach a Killer of the Year type progression, the creators instead decided to evolve Dexter in season 2. The season begins with someone locating Dexter's dumping ground, putting the whole country into panic over finding the \\"Bay Harbor Butcher.\\" The FBI dispatches an agent named Lundy (who is the L to Dexter's Kira) and the game is on.    Unlike the first season, season 2 is a lot more cerebral in nature and we're treated to Dexter learning more about who he is, and why he does what he does. This is in no small part thanks to one of his new acquaintances, Lila, a former meth addict from England. Lila helps Dexter understand the dark within him, and watching his facial expressions and actions as he begins to realize he can control his own destiny and make his own rules shows why Michael C. Hall is one of the top actors on television today.    Despite the fantastic, timeless performance of Hall and his supporting cast, the true star of Dexter is the writing. It's rare to see this much writing talent on a TV show, let alone this much talent remaining this consistent. I would argue that in recent television, only the middle portions of The Office come close in terms of writing, but unlike that show Dexter grows more gripping and entertaining as the seasons progress.    It's easy to tell when watching the show that the entire cast-from top to bottom-cares greatly about delivering a perfect product, which is something you sadly don't see too often these days. From no cliff-hangers to constant grittiness and realism in lieu of product placement and nods to other properties, Dexter is a show for people who like television, a good story, or seeing fantastic acting. If there's one downside to this season two release, it's that the studio doesn't quite show as much enthusiasm as the crew. Rather than features fans care about, we're left instead with episodes from other Showtime originals (two of which are from the second seasons of shows, making them pointless for non-fans). It's a travesty we don't have many of the features fans asked for, but don't let that keep you from getting the set, because the show itself more than makes up for it.    For those who watched engrossed as Dexter tracked down the Ice Truck Killer in season one, purchasing season two is a no-brainer. It's better in every way, and shows that there's really no predicting how great this series will turn out. For those who haven't watched Dexter yet, do yourself a favor: ignore any hesitancies, and go buy seasons one and two so you can catch up before season three starts later this month.    Years from now, people will be comparing Dexter to other classic shows like The Wire, The Sopranos, and 24. Why not get in early?
B00003CXAA|2.0|I know this series is in high regard for being the greatest gangster film of all-time, so I decided to check it out myself. Originally it was WAY too long for me to even want to see, but I was curious so one afternoon I sat through all of these films. That's 8 hours I'll never get back! I could've been doing something productive like playing World Of Warcraft instead. The films dragged on WAY too long and overstayed their welcome by about an hour each. There wasn't enough violence to make this a worthwhile gangster flick. Also, it was annoying when they spoke in Italian. They should've dubbed the voices instead. No one wants to read subtitles! How inconvenient. Finally, I'm giving this 2 stars because the third one was the only watchable one. Sequels made 20 years later are the bomb!<br /><br />See the new Johnny Depp movie \\"Public Enemies\\" or \\"Get Carter\\", \\"Be Cool\\" or \\"Dick Tracy\\" for real gangster films!
B0010ZR160|3.0|Gone Baby Gone is the story of private investigators Patrick (Casey Affleck) and Angie (Michelle Monaghan), and Patrick's journey to learn about his own sense of right and wrong on the mean streets of Boston.    The directorial debut for Ben Affleck, the film stars his younger brother Casey, as well as Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan, and Ed Harris. (Don't believe the cover--Morgan Freeman plays a limited role.) One day while watching the news in bed, the two PI's/lovers learn of a local girl in Boston being kidnapped, and watch as the mother (Amy Ryan) and her relatives plead for her return.    The following day, the missing girl's uncle and aunt come to the pair, asking for their assistance in tracking down what could have happened to their niece, as Patrick has all sorts of street connections the regular police don't have. Despite the protest by Angie (she doesn't want to find a little girl dead in a dumpster), Patrick accepts the task, and the two join detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) in trying to solve the case.    From there it's a series of twists and turns, false leads and false solutions, ultimately ending in a way that will completely split friends apart if you choose to discuss the final act.    In terms of the actual overall plot, Gone Baby Gone isn't anything too new; it's the little things that add up. Despite the critical success of films such as The Departed and Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone is, in my opinion, the best piece of modern cinema to showcase the tension and issues between cops, criminals, and the neighborhoods they co-exist in.    Ben Affleck does a surprising job in directing the film (guess we know where that duo's talent came from), and every scene seems to be filmed with care to the details, but it's never so overblown that it becomes pretentious. It's hard to judge a new director based on one film, but I think it's safe to say that Ben has a promising directorial career ahead of him if he decides he likesstaying behind the camera more than standing in front of it.    If I have one complaint about the film, it's that at times it becomes too preachy and too over-the-head-with-a-hammer obvious in what it's trying to accomplish. There are parts where a moral dilemna is faced by Patrick or the police with both sides being presented, but the filming and acting makes it very clear who it is we SHOULD be rooting for.    My only other complaint is the sticker on the front of the DVD case which was hyping the new eye-opening extended ending. In reality, the extended ending is the theatrical ending with another sentence of dialog spoken by Patrick as the film closes. It does little to create any new realizations, and anyone with common sense can tell that what he says is what he was thinking all along.    Still, Gone Baby Gone is a solid first effort by Affleck, and features a great cast of supporting actors you've never heard or seen before amidst film giants such as Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman. For those who like cop thrillers, Gone Baby Gone is a good movie that will likely be an enjoyable night in. If you didn't like The Departed or those ilk, though, this will do nothing to change that.      CONTENT - 3.5/5    The movie itself is solid enough, but I just can't help but shake the feeling that I only like it because I'm supposed to. It's enjoyable, really, but it's nothing that will be remembered when I look back months from now at my favorite movies I've watched this year. I can tell you one thing, though: years from now, college students will cite this as one of their favorites along with Donnie Darko.      VIDEO - 4/5    It's amazing how well they managed to fade colors and make them appear washed-out on a standard DVD disc. The entire film has the look of it like it's filmed on a low budget camera or in the 70s/80s, but it's pulled off so well that it becomes an addition to the narrative, not a deterrent.      AUDIO - 3/5    There's little use of surround in a film centered around dialog, but when there's background noises on the streets, they're well done. Subtract a point if you could never stand Boston accents.      EXTRAS - 3/5    There are two main extras: Going Home, and Capturing Authenticity. Going Home is a 20-odd minute set of talking head interviews and anecdotes with the people involved in shooting the film, as well as the author of the book. Decent enough, but for the most part it's pretty boring. Capturing Authenticity deals with the use of authentic city people in the movie, as well as the attempt to make it as authentic as possible. Solid enough, but I can't help but wish for a more fleshed out look. As for the deleted scenes... Well, I already told you my thoughts about the \\"thought provoking\\" extended ending.      REPLAY - 3.5/5    If you've seen it once, you'll never fall for the twists and revelations again. It is, however, a good film to watch with friends to spark some conversation. It's also a good way to tell if your friends are pro- or anti-kidnapping. Keep an eye on Kurt.      OVERALL - 3.5/5    Gone Baby Gone is a very solid debut for Director Ben Affleck, and overall an above average piece of cinema. While I don't agree with the widespread sentiment that it's one of the most thought provoking films of our generation, it is a good movie worth a watch. Possibly not one to purchase, but a rental shouldn't hurt at all.
0307269981|5.0|Steig Larsson was a master storyteller, and we in the US are now just becoming familiar with his incredible talent.  After being gripped by the The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (critical to read before this book), I anxiously waited for the US release of The Girl Who Played with Fire.  This latest allows the reader to get to know the mysterious Lisbeth Salander (from Dragon Tattoo) even better by revealing more of her past that shapes her unique character.  Larsson is a master at creating complex plots, developing characters and making the reader shift gears and perceptions, willingly.  Both books were almost impossible to put down, and seem to soar to top priority on the 'to do' list.  Absolutely riveting!  I understand that the third book (Hornet's Nest) in this Millenium series won't be out until next year... I'm already drumming my fingers in anticipation to see what we learn about Lisbeth next.  But, it is with great sadness that this incredible author's life was cut short, so we'll be sure to savor the last morsels when they are released next year.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Should I need to explain how important Sleeping Beauty is as an animated film, or what it's about? Probably not. Sadly, the movie gets passed over in favor of its more appealing Disney brethren, and few of today's generation (especially males) have seen it. Heard of it? Sure. It's a classic, after all. With this latest DVD release, Disney is hoping to provide the children, teens, and adults of today with another reminder of one of its most forgotten-but most memorable-classics.    First hitting theaters in 1959 after nearly a decade of work during the last ten years of Walt Disney's life, Sleeping Beauty was a different looking animated movie, and the first animated feature to be completed in a super-wide scope for theaters. I bet you didn't know Sleeping Beauty was the first movie to be both presented in Technirama widescreen format and shot in 70mm. (A fact which comes across splendidly in this new remastering.)    While the technology behind it may have been breaking ground, the story of Sleeping Beauty ultimately is just more of the \\"same ol' Disney!\\" thing. Taking one part Grimm's fairy tale, and one part Disney rewrite, Sleeping Beauty, as you likely know, revolves around a princess named Aurora, who is cursed at her christening by the evil witch Maleficent to die before she turns 16. Rather than let the young girl grow up to die, three fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather raise the girl under the alias Briar Rose in the woods.    I bet you could guess what happens next even if you've never seen it. Basically, Aurora is discovered by a charming prince with a white steed, and the evil pet bird of Maleficent. Evil spell, sleep, wake up with a kiss, fight a dragon-you know the rest.    The movie is a classic, you get that. What really makes this Platinum re-release of the DVD shine (remember it was released briefly in 2003 in a then-Special Edition) is the brilliant restoration and upgrade job they did with the art. When the 2003 version came out, I was amazed they were releasing Sleepin gBEauty in a 2.55:1 image; this release goes beyond that. Even if you've seen Sleeping Beauty dozens of times, this is like watching the movie anew. You'll see new things on the edges of the screen which add to scenes, and you'll see more detail of the brillian tartowkr. In short, they took an archaic release, upgraded it once, then kicked it up a notch and did it again.    The color palettes were also edited for better clarity and crispness. Overall, I like the changes and modernizing of the colors with the digital enhancement. There are some instances where the new changes don't even remotely resemble the original (such as when Aurora sees the green flames of the spinning wheel). In the newly colored scene, there's really no green ambient lighting at all until she's up against the fire. It's one of the few questionable changes, but overall the re-coloring is splendid and combined with the wider image, it's a visual treat.    Not only is the video improved, but the audio is as well. 5.1 sound, better upgraded clarity, and to top it all off original theatrical audio for those who refuse to watch classic releases tampered with.    If the better audio and video weren't enough, the extras trump what we got in the 2003 edition. Commentary tracks, historical documentaries on several of the minds behind individual aspects of the art/story, an alternate storyboard opening, deleted songs, a virtual tour of Sleeping Beauty's castle, and a 45 minute Making Of featurette highlight the brand new additions to the DVD. Along with those new additions, the Platinum Edition also features the best leftovers from the Special Edition, including storyboard sequences, live-action references, art galleries, trailer galleries, and a feature on four Disney artists crafting a tree.    Unlike many Disney re-re-releases, Sleeping Beauty: Platinum Edition is a grand slam. With an upgraded video transfer, much improved audio tracks, and a plethora of new and classic features, this is by far the best version of Sleeping Beauty ever released. Whether you picked up the 2003 edition or not, if you're a fan of Disney's classic movies, this is a must-buy. If you're on the fence, pick it up and hold on to it, because once it goes out of print and \\"re-enters the Vault\\" who knows how long it will be until you get a second chance.
B00169N0BK|3.0|I would give this a 5 star review because it works GREAT.<br /><br />But, I cannot get it to work on paper smaller than 8x10. It will not print the full test pattern on a 5x7 paper.<br /><br />Other than that, it is easy to use and does the job very well.<br /><br />But, I am bothered by this limitation. It looks like I will have to buy 8x10 paper of the exact same type to make a profile for a 5x7. It seems like you would want the profile to be very specific for each box of paper.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|What do you get when you combine state of the art CGI, some of the best actors in Hollywood, and animals performing kung fu? One of the year's best movies. Kung Fu Panda was widely loved by critics and fans during its theatrical release, and for good reason.    The movie centers around Po the panda, and his journey of self discovery. Po (Jack Black) is the (adopted) son of a noodle maker (played by the legendary James Hong), and his father wants nothing more than for Po to follow in the family footsteps of running the noodle shop. Unfortunately, Po has dreams of more kung fu-y things; his idols aren't chefs and cooks, but the legendary Furious Five.    When he hears that kung fu teacher Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) is going to hold trials to find out which of the Furious Five are the Dragon Warrior who is destined to save the village from the evil Tai Lung, Po drops everything, disrespects his father's wishes, and sneaks off to witness the trials. After a series of unfortunate events culminating in a firework powered rocket chair, Po becomes crowned the Dragon Warrior, and begins to learn kung fu in order to fulfill his destiny.    While a fairly cliché tale at its core, Kung Fu Panda nevertheless delights for a multitude of reasons. Whether it's the humorous dialog, the masterful voice acting by the stars (including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, David Cross, Lucy Liu, and Seth Rogen), or the ultimate lesson that anyone can achieve anything if they try hard enough, it's impossible not to love the movie. Not since Shrek has a non-Pixar animated film been this magnificent, and not since the Disney films of the early 90s has an animated movie managed to not only entertain children and adults, but also teach important lessons that are valuable to people of all ages, backgrounds, and lifestyles.     Visually and audibly, Kung Fu Panda is far superior on Blu-Ray than DVD, but unlike many modern movies the studio didn't seem to hold back from the traditional DVD release, and thepicture looks slightly better than Pixar's Ratatouille and Cars.    To reward DVD purchasers, the DVD comes packed with a special additional 30 minute feature revolving around the Furious Five. In this extra take, Po and Shifu return to the martial arts temple in order to train a group of young rabbits. In over his head, Po resorts to teaching them the five moralities of kung fu by explaining how each of the Furious Five (Crane, Monkey, Viper, Tigress, and Mantis) came to be who they were. Unlike the movie, The Secrets of the Furious Five is created with watercolor inspired Asian art, much like the film's opening credits.    Unfortunately, only David Cross reprises his role from the movie for the Furious Five. (Black and Hoffman both return as Po and Shifu, though.) The other four are noticeably absent, although Monkey's is handled quite brilliantly with Jaycee Chan (Jackie Chan's son) playing him. Who better to play a young version of Jackie Chan's character than Jackie's own son? It's disappointing to not get his voice back for more, but it's a smart decision that I felt paid off.    Outside of the extra separate disc feature, the features packed on the Kung Fu Panda disc itself are entertaining enough, but nothing stands out as extraordinary. The thirteen minute \\"Meet the Cast\\" feature is the most worthwhile of the bunch, as it shows a lot of the stars on the set and gets their take on what it's like to record voices in such an unusual picture. (Fun fact: I didn't notice Seth Rogen was Mantis until I watched this after the movie. Dude's in EVERYTHING these days!)    Despite the lack of meaningful extras other than the Secrets of the Furious Five and Meet the Cast, Kung Fu Panda is still a must-own on whatever format you're capable of playing. If you own a blu-ray player, buy it on BR. If you own a DVD player, buy it on DVD. It's a family movie that truly is fun for the whole family - even if your family has no one under the age of 20. Buy it, watch it, love it,and be reminded of the time when people other than Pixar made classic animated films.

B001H5X7KC|5.0|THE MOVIE    Tropic Thunder amazed audiences when it came out earlier this year. What originally looked to be a highly entertaining, if not stupid, comedy turned out to be a highly entertaining, action-packed comedy that lampoons not only war movies, but also a host of Hollywood clichés and personalities.    The film revolves around three fading actors-the award winner (Robert Downey, Jr.), the action star (Ben Stiller), and the comedian with a declining quality of films (Jack Black). Joining them is the up-and-coming rap superstar with a number of licensed products (Brandon Jackson). They're brought together when director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) decides to make an epic, big-budget war film. Unfortunately for him, the stars don't give a rat's ass about the production, and after only weeks of shooting the film is already way behind schedule, and way above budget.    Cue the Vietnam vet who wrote the book the in-movie movie is based upon, who suggests that to make it authentic, they film in the Vietnam jungles where soldiers once fought. Thinking the idea brilliant, Cockburn flies them out and begins trying to film guerilla style, with fake traps, actors, and events scripted unbeknownst to the actors in order to get realistic and lifelike reactions. Unfortunately, things go horribly wrong when the four actors find themselves not in the middle of the movie, but in the middle of a real warzone, with real Vietnamese drug lords hunting them down in order to kill the \\"American troops.\\"    The movie works on a number of levels. On one hand, it's brilliant as an over-the-top comedic action title. Stiller and his crew worked on the script for nearly a decade, and it shows through both the dialog, action, and referential treatment of Hollywood throughout. Tom Cruise, in the most brilliant performance he's given in years, plays an aging, balding, overweight film exec who cares only about the money and not the people in the movies. Meanwhile, the four stars, their agents, the director, the author, the sound guy, and many other cameo appearances parody any number of Hollywood ideas and personalities. Viewed as either a satire of war films, or as a satire of Hollywood, Tropic Thunder delivers on both levels with A-list performances, memorable scenes, and lots of fun action.    Movie Score: 4/5       THE DISC    The Blu-ray transfer of the film is, in one word, incredible. Presented in 1080p and an AVC-encoded package, the colors are vibrant, blacks are great, and the action on screen is bright and pops realistically. From textures of clothing and plants to mottled, grimy skin, the details are explicitly clear in the film; much more so than in theaters. It's a great film visually, and further testament to Paramount's ongoing claim as the best publisher of Blu-ray titles.    The TrueHD audio is no different. While there's little in terms of subtlety and cleanness throughout the film, the action is very clear, the bass is booming, and the ambiance of the jungle comes through as if you're there. Both visually and audibly, Tropic Thunder on Blu-Ray is reference quality that will impress any guests.    Unfortunately, while the special features are entertaining, there's nothing unique to the Blu-ray version-save the need to access BD-Live to watch two of them. The features list is a carbon copy of the DVD release, and while the extras are presented in high-def, it would have been nice to get some BR-exclusives.    There's the usual commentaries, deleted scenes, and production features. The most entertaining extras are easily the Rain of Madness mockumentary, which is a parody of the Hearts of Darkness documentary from Apocalypse Now, and Full Mags, which features alternate improvisations from the set by the crew. Rain of Madness is hilarious, and at 30 minutes is quite beefy for what it is. If you enjoy documentaries or have even watched one, it's a must-see because you'll be laughing your ass off.    In the end, Tropic Thunder on Blu-ray is a must-buy for fans of comedy, action, or satire. It's a wonderfully biting and intelligent movie filled with plenty of explosive action, and presented with one of the cleanest video and audio transfers out yet. Buy it, watch it, love it, watch it again-just don't skip it.    Disc Score: 5/5

B001P9KR94|4.0|THE MOVIE    The story of Slumdog Millionaire is, oddly enough, something you could easily see becoming a movie. A little heralded, straight-to-DVD movie; an executive taking a chance by putting it out in theaters; that same film dominating the Academy Awards, and becoming one of the best films of the year, making a star of its young leading actor. Sounds Hollywood, doesn't it?    It's odd for a movie to become so inexplicably popular, but Slumdog did it. While I did (and do) love the movie -- and consider it one of the best films of 2008 -- I have to step out on a limb here and state, on the record, that I do think the movie is overrated. Good? Yes. Great? Close. The best movie of 2008? Not quite.    Still, Slumdog is a fantastic movie the first time you experience it.    The story revolves around Jamal Malik, a young man from the slums of Mumbai, suddenly finding himself in the hot seat on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Inexplicably, Jamal seems to know the answers to every question. Accused of cheating, he's taken to a secure location, where the police \\"interview\\" him to get a confession. Of course, it turns out Jamal isn't cheating; rather, the answers to the questions come from his own life experiences. And what a life this young slumdog has led!    The film plays artfully between past and present. In one moment, you'll witness Jamal being \\"questioned,\\" and in the next you'll witness a much younger Jamil having to find a way to survive in the world, as many poor orphans (and non-orphans) are forced to do in India's slums. Along for the ride are Jamal's older brother, Salim, and the girl he knew since childhood, Latika. Starting out as homeless, penniless, hopeless orphans, the seesawing chronological tale shows the ways life can treat a young slumdog, and Jamal and Salim play perfect foils to one another; Jamal is the boy who desires to escape and avoid a life of crime in favor of moderate living, while Salim is slowly enticed by illegal workings and the gangster lifestyle.    As the film progresses, director Danny Boyle (yes, the same guy from the zombie flicks) takes us to places in India we may have seen in books, but that we've never seen before. Aside from the well weaved story, Slumdog's true charm comes from the feeling it exudes. On one hand a familiar world we can understand; on the other something so different that it may shock or disgust more sheltered viewers.    Ultimately, Slumdog is one of those \\"feel good\\" movies that, at the end, makes you smile. Is the journey always happy? No. But, as I'm sure you'll be able to ascertain, the ending certainly leaves off on an overall happy note. There are a few problems with the narrative here and there, but overall, the story is solid, it leaves you feeling good, and there are only minor issues. The biggest issue, perhaps, is that once you've seen it, you can never see it the same way again. Some movies get better with repeat viewings -- some stay roughly the same. Slumdog Millionaire, however, is markedly lessened with each viewing. Maybe it's because, after seeing it, the strange and unfamiliar sights and culture aren't so strange and unfamiliar anymore?         THE DISC      - Audio and Video -     One of Danny Boyle's signatures is using various types of cameras and films when shooting, resulting in scenes that look entirely unique to the rest of the movie. That strategy is employed in full force in Slumdog Millionaire, and never has it looked so good. The transfer to Blu-ray is spectacular, and near-reference quality. Colors are vivid, blacks are deep, and certain scenes look incredibly realistic. The only problem I noticed was, in some scenes, grain seemed to be a bit more present, and less an artistic use and more a technical limitation. There's also a problem with bloom in some scenes, but nothing too worrying.    Those two issues are minor, and on the whole the video of Slumdog Millionaire on Blu-ray is as close to reference quality as you can get. It just misses the boat, but it's definitely one of the best looking films to come out so far this year.    If the video is near-reference, the audio is above and beyond reference quality. I knew the movie (and soundtrack) sounded good when I saw it in theaters, but who knew it could sound better in my living room! Presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround, the audio is easily the best part of this release. Surrounds are employed to a great extent, really capturing the feel of urban slums. If it has one drawback, it's that it can be too loud -- too overbearing -- at times. With all of the little sounds going on in every scene, it's easy to want to turn it up to fully hear the atmosphere. But a minute later, the bass will kick in, or some foreground sound will increase, and suddenly you'll find yourself fumbling with the remote so you don't agitate your neighbor. (Although, if you live in a city maybe you can convince them the noise is coming from outside...)       - Extras -    The extras include the fare you'd expect with a release like this, but little of what you'd hope to see. To start off, there's the mandatory commentaries, the main one being by Danny Boyle and Slumdog star Dev Patel. Boyle goes on and on about the making of the movie and generally covers everything with a thick layer of enthusiasm, but Patel only offers a few real interesting tidbits, likely since he's not used to this sort of thing yet.    Next you have the deleted (and extended) scenes. A majority of the running time is spent extending scenes currently in the movie, but there are some worthy deleted ones that should be watched, including more fleshing out of Jamal and Salim's teenage years. Nothing that will alter how you view the picture, but worth watching for fans and non-fans alike.    Then, there's my favorite, \\"Slumdog Dreams,\\" which is the \\"making of\\" of Slumdog Millionaire. It gives an interesting look at some of the challenges a Western crew faced filming in Mumbai, aswell as some of the unexpected problems that arose. Not too long (at a little over 20 minutes), but entertaining and informative.    In a move that may surprise many people, Slumdog Millionaire actually has Blu-ray exclusive features! One of them (\\"from script to screen\\") is short, clcoking in at about 5 minutes, but the other is substantially longer. Unfortunately, it's a very specific piece for a very specific audience. Titled \\"Manjha,\\" the short black and white film (about 40 minutes running time) follows an actual slumdog through the streets of Mumbai, as he struggles to survive along with his baby sister. A fantastic story and one that must be told... But compared to the movie, a little -- make that a lot -- dark. If Slumdog made you happy and romanticize slums, then this will bring you back to earth.       - Verdict -    Slumdog Millionaire may not have been my favorite movie of 2008, but it's still a fantastic film. Sadly, there aren't as many extras for a Best Picture winner as I'd hope, but maybe we'll get the No Country treatment and see a special edition down the line. Until then, if you haven't seen Slumdog yet, this is by far the best way to do so. The film looks gorgeous, sounds bloody fantastic, and is a very inviting tale with enough character development to satisfy even the most jaded of critics. If you already saw it in theaters and were hoping for a few hours of extra material, I'm sad to say you'll have to keep waiting. In the meantime, still give picking this one up a thought. It may not have been my Best Picture for 2008, but so far it's easily the Best Blu of 2009. (So far.)      Movie Score: 4 / 5  Disc Score: 4 / 5  Overall Score: 4 / 5
B0006L16N8|5.0|Definitely a must buy for anyone interested in Coldplay or a Coldplay fan. It is also very different from their newest album, Viva La Vida, so don't expect the same type of feelings with this album. However, still a great buy!
B00275EGTW|3.0|As many other reviews have already pointed out, Moon is the kind of beautiful, intelligent, and intense film that redeems the reputation of the science fiction genre in an age when mindless summer blockbusters garnering all the public's attention claim membership in the same category.  The film pays loving tribute to several great science fiction pieces that have come before it, perhaps most prominently including Tarkovsky's [[ASIN:B00006L92F Solaris]] and Kubrick's [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey]], yet it consciously resists the urge to follow in their footsteps, even using familiar plot elements from these films as red herrings.<br /><br />Indeed, Moon takes its own path into the psychological and technological unknown, serving up a slow-paced, rich character study of a man on the brink.  And, while the sets and models are convincing and deliver everything that the story requires of them, director Duncan Jones resists the urge to indulge in gratuitous special effects and action sequences.  For most of the film, Moon is exactly what tasteful science fiction should strive to be: high production value, but never at the cost of the idea; never with the sole intent of showing off.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after a few less than thrilling revelations a little more than halfway into the film, a threat is determined, a countdown is established, and what was once an intense study of the mind and soul bumbles into a simple plot device.  While there are no over the top action sequences, the clock is ticking, and there's little time left to think and consider.  As the film kicks into its final act and the script lays its final cards on the table (which I will not spoil in this review), we find the surprise revelation we've been waiting for to be nothing more than a confirmation of what we'd already been mostly told.  As my family and I left the theater, we shared the surprise revelations that we had expected and hoped to see in the final act, all of which were far more imaginative than what actually happened.  The film could have done a lot more to provide shock and dramatic impact at this point.<br /><br />Worst of all, though, the film ultimately fails to leave us with anything to consider.  The plot is resolved too easily with no unanswered questions and no psychological, existential, nor sociological parallels to be considered.  Any such issues raised early in the film are abandoned partway through, and while the film is suspiciously littered with biblical names and references, there is no apparent unifying theme that helps us to organize and make sense of them.  Protagonist Sam Bell shares some characteristics in common with the prophet Samuel, but why is his daughter named Eve?  Why are the four harvesters named after the gospels, and what is the significance of the fact that Luke is the one that is offline throughout the film?  Why does the number 3 (likely referring to the holy trinity) occur an inordinate amount of times throughout the film?  I've pieced together my own theory about this, in which Sam functions as all three parts of the holy trinity and as the savior of his own people (this statement won't make any sense unless you see the film), but I feel as though I am grasping at straws.  Jones does not leave us enough clues to draw any definitive ideas from this other than the fact that a biblical level of interpretation is intended.  Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />In the end, Moon is a strong science fiction piece, but it falls just short of achieving a meaningful and artistic purpose like the great films it homages.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|After renting the Pinocchio 70th Anniversary edition, I came to Amazon to purchase my own copy. I was extremely saddened when I read Jon Olivan's dire revue (the very first review and supposedly the most helpful):     \\"BEWARE PURISTS--this Digitally Restored version TAMPERED WITH ORIGINAL ARTWORK'S COLOR PALETTE!!!\\"    So I purchased the Limited Issue instead (used) from Amazon, because I wanted to see it as close to how Walt envisioned it as I could find. After watching it, I could hardly believe how bad the transfer was compared to the 70th Anniversary edition. The colors were dull and the detail was gone and there were scratches and other artifacts. I then bought the 70th Anniversary edition. It is far superior.     Here is a web page which shows side-by-side comparisons of a frame from the cage scene mentioned in the review:    [...]    I also do not believe the 70th Anniversary edition is the \\"Thomas Kinkade-ing\\" of Pinocchio as another reviewer wrote. And it is NOT garish-it has lots of subtle shading. I am not a fan of Thomas Kinkade. I am a fan of all things Disney, and this version is spectacular. It is the very essence of Disney. You will be charmed from the first moment it starts.    Don't let some 'expert' discourage you from getting this DVD. It's too bad his review is all the way at the top. By the way, Pinocchio was locked in Stromboli's birdcage and not Geppetto's birdcage as the 'expert' wrote.     If you don't own the 70th Anniversary edition, get it while you can. It is a masterpiece.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|This movie was incredible! I rented it at the Redbox machine for a buck just to watch something and had to go buy the blu ray. It is really stunning in hi def. The opening scene is great and so are many other of the racing scenes. Very good stuff. I have no idea why anybody would give this a bad review. It had a decent plot but anybody watching this is expecting to see high paced intense action and this delivers that big time!

B001DHXT6G|4.0|I grew up watching the original series on NBC, and while I am all in favour of nostalgia, I have to say I love the remastering and new digital effects on these DVDs.  Planet surfaces now have textures when seen from space, the colours are no longer washed out, and the images are sharper and crisper.  The argument can and has been made that this is the way Star Trek would have looked had Gene Roddenberry had the technology available to him back in 1966.  My biggest complaint in that the default subtitles on many of the episodes changes from None to Spanish for no apparent reason.  The first episode or two on each disk will not have any subtitles, then for no reason, the next one or two will have Spanish subtitles.  So you have to exit the episode, go back to the main menu, select \\"None\\" in the subtitles menu, and then go back to the episode.  Worse, there is no indication of when this is going to happen, and selecting \\"None\\" when you first load the disk has no effect on later episodes on the disk.  To me this is far more of a \\"deal breaker\\" than the new digital effects. Also, as others have noted, the first season disks have the now defunct HD-DVD episodes on the \\"A\\" side of the disk, while the other two seasons have them on the \\"B\\" side.  It's a petty gripe, but if you don't realise this, and try to play the first season without flipping the disks over first, the disks won't load and you might mistakenly believe you received faulty disks.
0307266303|5.0|I just finished Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World has Never Seen on my recent West Coast road trip. I listened to the audio download version and stayed riveted to the story whenever I could get a spare moment with my iPod. The author Christopher McDougall begins with the question most runners ask themselves at some point. If running is so good for me why does something always hurt? Not just muscle stiffness from tough work outs, but genuine overuse injuries from the low back down to the heels. While exploration of associations between over-engineered running shoes and the explosion of running injuries the past 4 decades was provocative, McDougall primarily derives the answer to his question from his interactions with the Tarahumara Indians and a group of oddball American ultra-marathoners.<br /><br />The Tarahumara are a mysterious people from the rugged and largely inaccessible Copper Canyons of Mexico whose ancient culture revolves around a love of running, and not just foot races through the village, but extraordinary runs of unfathomable distances for young and old alike. Yet, as intriguing as the Tarahmara and the eccentric American ultra-runners (shoed and barefoot) were in this book the sections I enjoyed most involved the discussions of evidence accumulated by a small group of scientists indicating that humans were designed to run long distances. This unique ability within the animal kingdom may explain how our species survived and thrived before developing tools despite being slow and relatively underdeveloped in terms of musculature. This has been, and may still be, the minority opinion when it comes to the origins of human locomotion, with walking being the favored explanation for our upright posture. Nevertheless, the evidence for long distance running as the means by which humans out competed their pre-historical counterparts is persuasive and is based on evidence obtained from multiple fields including comparative anatomy, paleontology, anthropology, biomechanics and exercise physiology.<br /><br />Considering that many people have not run for years or even decades is it any wonder why humans are now wracked with a variety of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure and depression? We have increasingly separated ourselves from our genetic blueprint. We were designed to run.omy, paleontology, anthropology, biomechanics and exercise physiology.

B002I9ZMWC|5.0|When it comes to Kindle publications, a review of the readability of the text really is much more critical than of the work itself. There are plenty of reviews of this book out there. But Kindle versions of any classic work are a dime a dozen, and they vary greatly.    This version (Candlelight Press or publications or whatever it is) looks fine. Nothing special, nothing fantastic, but it gets the job done, the formatting is fine, and it's a buck.    The end.
B000YRY8BG|3.0|To me the BBC's State of Play was actually two different movies, alas with the parts not matching. It says in the commentary that the first victim's killer was changed halfway through filming by the writer, something no one else here seems to mention, and to me that was only being too clever by half. Not being able to give away the plot, I can only say here that events occurred in the first half of the movie that were never answered in the second half, and that the ultimate 'killer's' motivation was totally unclear in light of previous events, and hardly cleared up in the ending. Still, I do have to give the movie 3 stars for some taut directing and excellent performances, especially by the wonderful Bill Nighy as the newspaper editor. (Although, not to denigrate the performance of the actor who played the antagonist Stephen Collin, he was forced to present us with a character of such raw emotion and physical temper that to believe he was such a successful politician that he being groomed for a cabinet post is fairly laughable.) In any event, in a thriller the script should always come first, and it was here that the movie was at least for me unnecessarily contrived and fatally flawed. The writer and others involved should have kept to the original script - though not overly original it probably would've made far better overall sense.
B0019LY5I2|4.0|To be fair, I've two conflicting viewpoints on this film. One is that of the adult filmgoer who's seen more than his fair share of cinema and can look at this film as nothing more than another summer action film. The other viewpoint is that of the nine-year-old boy who had a room full of G.I. Joe toys and watched the cartoon show everyday after school back in the 80s. I'll give reviews for both viewpoints.    *For the non-Joe fans:  If you're not a fan or have no prior knowledge of the 1980s G.I. Joe franchise, chances are this is a movie you can skip in the theaters. A few great action sequences aside, it'll likely be a film that has more cons than pros for you.  If you're going into this film for just a straight up good action flick you'll likely be disappointed with the horrible acting, spastic editing, overly clichéd moments, and mediocre directing. A \\"C\\" grade (2 ½ star) film at best.     *For the Joe Fans:  As a longtime fan I walked out of G.I. Joe feeling like the film had some really great parts, but as a whole it didn't reach its potential. The main element that turned me off as a long time Joe fan was the way Storm Shadow & Snake Eyes were handled. They had what I'm sure were pretty spectacular sword fights, but I couldn't tell because of all the ridiculous close ups and jump cuts! Plus the two brief flashbacks handling their history together were just plain awful.    Surprisingly the Baroness character turned out to be the most interesting part of the film. She was a much more fully realized character than her animated counterpart and she was perhaps the most sympathetic and well rounded character in the entire film. I thought the plot of the film was actually pretty good. They made a really plausible prequel for the 80s cartoon show. Well, as plausible as one can get for an 80s cartoon show. As the title implies, this film is all about how Cobra is formed. And it does a fairly decent job of explaining why so many capable people followed the weak and almost inept leader of Cobra in the cartoon show as well as how the iconic characters of Destro, Zartan, Baroness, Storm Shadow, Dr. Mindbender, and Cobra Commander all came together. Also for fanboys wondering about the absent Cobra logo, towards the very end of the film we get a brief underwater glimpse of it.     Speaking of the ending, this will likely be a BIG controversy for Joe fans and geeks in general. I won't go into spoiler territory here, but I will say it's basically a combination of the endings of Star Wars Episodes I & IV. No, seriously. My friends and I were having a blast pointing out all the \\"lifted\\" shots and similar moments between the films. Personally I thought it was fun and meant to be kind of obvious (because it really is obvious), a geeky bit of cross-pollinating cinema if you will. However, I can understand how some fans will take this as a \\"rip-off\\" and be angered they paid to see G.I. Joe movie but got a bootlegged version of a Star Wars ending instead.    The film was obviously set up as the first in a franchise and there is room for improvement as they add some more classic Joe characters and hopefully get a better director to helm the franchise. The 80s nostalgia driven fan in me gives this flawed yet fun attempt at realizing a beloved childhood cartoon as live-action cinema a grade of B+ (3 ½ stars).

B000002UVX|5.0|Power of Soul, and Message to Love have some truly great guitar work. This band, an attempt on Hendrix part to move in a new direction, had some great elements. Frankly, I wonder of Buddy Miles was right for the band. But Billy Cox was perfect for Hendrix.<br /><br />Now, I must address Machine Gun. The first time I heard it, it scared me to death. I knew Hendrix' music, and what he was capable of doing. But the sheer instensity of this song was almost unendurable. I've met people who were in Viet Nam, and other wars. They all told me that Hendrix nailed it: took the sound and emotional / visceral experience (no pun intended) of a war zone, and transformed it into music.<br /><br />I also know some people who were at this concert. One of them was on acid, and said that during Machine Gun, it actually felt like machine gun bullets hitting him. Another person, who was not on acid during the concert, said the exact same thing! Hendrix was a master at creating a musical vibe in any place he played - and no state of consciousness, high or sober - could stand against what he was conjuring.

0765348276|4.0|I was pleased to finally read this prequel to \\"The Ghost Brigades\\" which I read last year.<br /><br />Like \\"The Ghost Brigades\\" I found \\"Old Man's War\\" to be a fairly simple story that explores a world where it is really possible to get a second (and a third and a forth..) chance to live your life.<br /><br />Set in a future where the human race is competing with myriad other alien races for substantially the same resources, the humans recruit their soldiers from Earth's seventy year olds and give them new and improved bodies to get the best kind of soldier: One that is physically superb and has the grounding and experience to understand what's at stake and a stake in the future that they are helping to protect (they pretty much all have children and grandchildren that they want to see survive into the future).<br /><br />Told exclusively from the point of view of the protagonist,  you will not get lost or confused as to what is going on. Nor is there any need to try to interpret different story threads to try to divine future confluences as you do with the more complex stories told by Peter F. Hamilton or Frank Herbert.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable, easy read that IMHO speaks to issues that it is absolutely possible that the human race may face one day.
B001OQCV9M|3.0|Food is love. Food fills you, contains its share of substitute ingredients, or can be one itself.<br /><br />Iconic chef/author/TV star Julia Child learned French cooking in Paris because, in her words, it was \\"something to do because I needed something to do\\" in France's uncertain days after WWII. Young wife Julie Powell learned Julia Child's French recipes and cooked each, blogging her efforts. This would help her rise above domineering mom, friends, and cubicle job in New York post-9/11.<br /><br />Nora Ephron thus cooked up \\"Julie and Julia\\" not only from Ms. Child's biography and Ms. Powell's respective books but from her recipe of notorious \\"chick flick\\" hits directed and/or written with Rob Reiner (\\"Sleepless In Seattle,\\" \\"You've Got Mail.\\") In each, lovers bond gradually from a distance through a commonly loved film, a new technology or, in this case, admiration for delicious food and a need for self-expression. But this distance is time, this love bonding not only husbands and wives but a student for her mentor and mentor's textbook.<br /><br />Helped by Meryl Streep's dead-on impersonation, Ephron skillfully chronicles Ms. Child's early, gawky attempts to find her voice and vocation in sepia-toned, post-WWII Paris. Her beloved husband Paul (a dignified, doting Stanley Tucci) helps win WWII with his intelligence efforts, then is grilled mercilessly in the early 50's Cold War/McCarthy-era.  Gradually, Ms. Child not only becomes an expert French chef through perseverance and competitiveness (an amusing, tear-inducing scene with a chopped onion mountain), but gains relationships and business sense to see \\"Mastering The Art of French Cooking\\" fulfill her husband's promise as a book to change the world.<br /><br />Ms.Child's book changed the life of Julie Powell (a perky, enticing Amy Adams). She attempts to fulfill her novelist promise as a thirtysomething by recording her efforts to make all Ms. Child's recipes. This leads to complications humorous, if expected (battles cooking eggs and containing live lobsters, cleverly adapting a Talking Heads classic) as well as a brief, incongruent conflict with her otherwise supportive husband (Chris Mussina) which ends half-baked after starting as overdone as her attempt at Child's boeuf bourguignon.<br /><br />\\"Julie and Julia\\" has sweet, occasionally savory moments: Ms. Child's heartbreak over her infertility, Ms. Powell's frustration and tears over being stood up by one important dinner guest and having her efforts frowned on by her idol. It also has Ms. Powell's admiration of Ms. Child boil over, especially near film's end. But overall, in a summer dominated by adolescent toys, games, and books becoming cookie-cutter films, \\"Julie and Julia\\" is a light, sweet, atmospheric grown-up treat.taining live lobsters, cleverly adapting a Talking Heads classic) as well as a brief, incongruent conflict with her otherwise supportive husband (Chris Mussina) which ends half-baked after starting as overdone as her attempt at Child's boeuf bourguignon.    \\"Julie and Julia\\" has sweet, occasionally savory moments: Ms. Child's heartbreak over her infertility, Ms. Powell's frustration and tears over being stood up by one important dinner guest and having her efforts frowned on by her idol.

B0000029LG|5.0|I never purchase this CD until after he passed away.  My absolute loss!  The only positive of this fact is the music on it is brand new to me.<br /><br />This is a fantastic piece of work, almost completely composed by MJ himself.  Up until this time Off the Wall had always been my favorite MJ album.<br /><br />Disc one needs no review.<br /><br />Make no mistake as previously posted by many, Disc 2 is a very angry CD.  From Scream to They Don't Care About Us, Tabloid Junkie, D.S., Money, Come Together (this was recorded in 1987 I believe), 2Bad, and Earth Song all scream at you about something.  It is amazingly personal and makes you feel his pain.<br /><br />Of the 'hard' songs I have to say 'Earth Song' (one of his best ever), and 'They Don't Care About Us' stand out.  'Scream' also grows on you after multiple listens.<br /><br />Of the slower songs, without a doubt 'Stranger in Moscow' is my favorite.  Not only do I feel it is the best song on the CD, I feel it is one of his best ever!<br /><br />'Little Susie' is musically beautiful, sounds like a movie score.<br /><br />'Childhood' is a little over the top for me.<br /><br />'History' is epic, just a great song from beginning to end.  It also was remixed for the 'Blood on the Dance Floor' CD and I still can not decide which version I prefer.<br /><br />'You are Not Alone' is wonderful pop ballad, but not one of my favorites.  I think the video influences my decision though.<br /><br />The CD's final song 'Smile' is well done and very sad.  You can almost hear MJ break down on the record.  I never knew this was his favorite song until his memorial service.<br /><br />This is definitely desert island worthy!

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Pixar does it again! They deliver a wonderful movie in every way for audiences of all ages! I had the pleasure of taking my oldest daughter to see this (her first time seeing a movie in the theater), and seeing her facial expressions was priceless. This adorable story is one of the funniest Pixar films I've seen, about an old man who just lost his adventurous wife (in what, I may add, is one of the saddest Pixar montage scenes ever made). In order to fulfill his promise to her, and avoid submission to an \\"old folks home,\\" Carl Fredricksen uses about a thousand or so balloons and takes off for South America where he will retire to live out the rest of his days at Paradise Falls -- the place his wife so desperately wanted to go before her death. Along the way, though, he is joined by Cub Scout Russell, the very depiction of youth that Carl both envies and at times despises. Along the way they befriend a rare bird, come across \\"talking\\" dogs and run into their nemesis --  Carl's childhood hero, Charles Muntz -- who's been trying to kidnap the bird and hence thwart their mission.<br /><br />As usual, Pixar throws in so many slight \\"Easter Eggs\\" story lines that it would take more than just one viewing to pick up on all of them. One example of an \\"Easter egg\\" storyline plot is the fact that when Carl and Russell first meet, Russell, reading from his Cub Scout guide, asks Carl if he can help him cross the street, cross his lawn, cross anything -- anything so he can get his final badge of helping an senior citizen. Of course, most viewers will/should pick up that Russell helps Carl do another sort of \\"crossing\\" by near movie's end. It's a theme that's central to Carl's character and storyline: crossing his heart. Keeping that promise that's so important to those closest to us in life. And what results is one of the sweetest, most touching endings to a Pixar movie. Of course, this comes from a guy who teared up when first watching the ending of [[ASIN:B00005JKDR Monsters, Inc. (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], when Sully pops that final splinter into the door, steps through and hears Boo's voice, \\"Kitty!\\" Oh. &lt;sniff> Oh, man. &lt;sniff, sniff><br /><br />Now that I'm a father, those emotions and little cute moments in most of Pixar's movies appeals to me, and touches me, much more than it did before parenthood (although it was still good back then too). \\"Up\\" is one of my favorite movies of the year so far; I'll continue to entrust Pixar with the quality they produce.-Disc Collector's Edition)]], when Sully pops that final splinter into the door, steps through and hears Boo's voice, \\"Kitty!\\" Oh. <sniff> Oh, man. <sniff, sniff>    Now that I'm a father, those emotions and little cute moments in most of Pixar's movies appeals to me, and touches me, much more than it did before parenthood (although it was still good back then too). \\"Up\\" is one of my favorite movies of the year so far; I'll continue to entrust Pixar with the quality they produce.

B002BFBAWO|3.0|As someone who once worked at an amusement park, I knew I had to see this! But ... sadly, this is definitely a Hollywood version of a teenager, amusement park flick. It's got the not-so-attractive guy -- who would never realistically have a chance with two girls -- getting two girls who look like Kristen Stewart and Margarita Levieva. I don't care how cool this guy is supposed to be, no girls like these two would bat an eye at him. However, that usually doesn't faze me as that seems to be the theme to Judd Apatow-produced comedies nowadays. Director Greg Mottola, who also wrote this, showed real flair when directing [[ASIN:B000WZEZG8 Superbad - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], but for all its great comedic cast and plot, \\"Adventureland\\" isn't anything spectacular.<br /><br />I will say that the stand-outs in this film are Martin Starr ([[ASIN:B0001EQHXO Freaks and Geeks - The Complete Series]], [[ASIN:B000TZJBQ0 Knocked Up - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], \\"Superbad\\"), who is brilliant in just about everything he does; Bill Hader, who can not only pull off his own brand of geeky-type humor but also great hard@$$ scenes (see the baseball bat scene and how effortlessly he transitions); the background characters who bring spice to an otherwise mediocre script, such as Tommy Frigo (Matt Bush), Munch (Barret Hackney), and Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva), because these type of characters are - much like in real life - the ones you remember and laugh about; and the spectacular soundtrack!!! If you are a fan of 1980s alternative such as The Replacements, The Velvet Underground, The New York Dolls, Husker Du, The Cure, Lou Reed and Nick Lowe, and 1980s pop such as INXS, David Bowie, Crowded House, Whitesnake, Judas Priest, and, yes, Falco (\\"DO THEY HAVE TO KEEP PLAYING THIS SONG!?\\"), then you'll be racing to find the soundtrack, which sadly is only available as a MP3 download.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds and SNL's Kristen Wiig are poorly underused in the film, although Wiig is still hilarious; I have a feeling her hit is gonna be in the Drew Barrymore-directed roller derby dramedy \\"Whip It.\\" This film had a lot of promise but I don't fall for Kristen Stewart's method of acting which is basically always looking uncomfortable.

B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Walt Disney has done better animated films in the past. This one is rather average. But it is important because it shows a radical change in the targeted audience. The concept of family audience has completely changed. The kids are no longer accompanied by their parents but by their grand-parents. So the film targets these grand-parents as a potential audience and is built on two main characters, the child and the senior citizen. The whole film is based on this crossing over three generations. Then the film is also aiming at a younger audience that is living in decomposed more than recomposed families and the child is thus living with his father and another woman than his mother, and he is systematically betrayed, in spite of what he mat say, by his father. The boy scouts are shown as particularly father-centered if not male-chauvinistic by not allowing a boy to be supported by another person than his father when receiving medals in some ritual ceremony, the father or another fatherly man, but not the mother. A very long tradition with Walt Disney: their support of the family structure like with Ebenezer Scrooge in the famous Christmas Carol, or of course Snow White and Cinderella. Fathers are not particularly enhanced and step mothers are frankly demonized. The animals of the film are not essential, just some kind of mirror in which children will be able to recognize their phantasms and dreams. But this film is absolutely Anglo-Saxon and based on a myth from this culture and this culture only, or nearly, and particularly the English branch of that myth and culture, the Lost World of Conan Doyle, the belief in the existence of a pocket or virginal nature surviving behind un-crossable mountains that can only be reached by air with a blimp or a flying house. It is thus normal to have some paradise cataract and a bird of paradise, a giant one mind you, and of course this bird will have three chicks, a trinity that is there to sanctify this virginal world, this garden of Eden. At a time when Jules Verne was looking for adventures that contained a great quantity of danger, Conan Doyle was dreaming of the rediscovery of the garden of Eden. Charles Muntz has little to do with Captain Nemo. In fact he has no humanity at all, not even the good sense to forget about, and forgive, the dumbness of human beings. He is ready to kill a child and destroy a bird of paradise and doom its - her actually - chicks to perdition for his own vanity. It is these particularities that make the film interesting, but it does not have the finesse and the subtlety of Ratatouille. The allusions to American culture are numerous but it would be fastidious to give them all, like the small house surrounded by high rise buildings (Death of a Salesman). These allusions are aimed at the adult and elderly audience of course. But I can't resist asking one final question: is the Shady Oaks retirement home covering some shady business or some shaky eugenic mentality concerning the elderly?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDf Eden.

B00204AA0O|5.0|I read many reviews before actually listening to the album, which got me to think it's going to be a completely commercialized and soul-less piece. But after listening to it probably 20 times over the past 2 days (I just can't stop listening to it) I think it's an excellent album, complete with creative and insightful lyrics, beautiful vocals and melodies. It might be less raw than her previous work (which she had single handedly produced) but that's just natural. People often expect artists to produce the same product they love over and over and get disappointed when they move on. Only thing is, the artists that do survive trend changes actually flow with them (e.g., Joni Mitchell, Madonna among others).

B000ZEE3I6|1.0|Unless you're an ardent follower of Harry Potter this movie is definitely not for the novice. To me what makes Harry Potter enjoyable is its sense of wonder. This movie has none of that. I admit I've never read the books but I did like the earlier movies. I think this movie could have really been edited down. Do we really have to wait 2 more movies before we get to Voldermort? I don't care any more.
B001HN69AE|1.0|I'm sorry to say this, but Not even the awesome power of Blu-ray can help this picture, this movie is beyond terrible, you will not believe how bad this movie really is. I'm not reviewing the blu-ray features because, If a movie sucks so bad why the hell would you (or I) want to watch the special features?      First off, the Main Story is severely butchered to the point where everything unrecognizable to the original. The story is told very hasty and they don't bother to explain anything, and The've also rip off ideas from other great films... Dragon ball is known for great edge of your seat fighting Anime sequences, but in this movie There aren't any good fighting scenes AT ALL! None, Zero.      Second: There are absolutely NO character development in this movie at all, Bulma comes out of Nowhere holding a gun and says: they've stolen the dragonballs can you help? And Goku helps her, for no apparent reason. they team up and find master roshi, who likes to talk while he waves his hands, for no apparent reason!?.     Third: In the Anime and Manga, the main character Goku is supposed to be a happy, fun, cheerful, energetic character that only gets mad when bad people are doing bad things. In this movie goku is nothing but a stupid teenage kid who can't get a girlfriend, ride his bike to school and spends half of the movie feeling sorry for himself. (Lame!) And The DIALONG IN THIS FILM IS THE WORST I'VE EVER HEARD!     Fourth: For unknown reasons, one of the main character, Krillin does not appear in this movie (and I don't know why?). And for more unknown CRAPtacular reasons They used The Kamehame wave, (which is suppose to be a destructive beam technique) TO revive Goku as he lays on the ground because he's about to die, over a small idiotic gun shot wound. (I'm not even afraid to spill anything for you because your not gonna go see this)     Fifth: The ending battle between Goku and Picollo is SO retarded!, Goku throws a big Kamahame wave (which looks totally fake)and all you see is bright lights, They don't even show when piccolo gets hit!!! It's with out a doubt the Stupidest looking, CRAPtacular actions sequence I've ever seen in a action film!     Sixth: The only relation this movie has to the original dragon ball is the Dragonballs themselves THAT'S IT! this movie should have been called The Passion, because it was 90 minutes of pure torture. This is purely Hollywood's best at Film Raping.     Seventh: if you're a FAN of Dragonball, and even if you Not a fan of Dragonball, this movie is mediocre and disappointing from the beginning to end, It's Not entertaining, there's bad acting, the costumes in this movie looks like they found them laying around in back of a trashed Halloween store. I love the original Dragonball so, if you're a fan of the original you must stay away from this!..... This film easily makes my top ten list of the worst films I have ever seen... so,  OVERALL!  AVOID THIS FILM...PERIOD!
B001GCUNWG|5.0|Took my nephew to see it and he loved it. I thought it was hilarious as well. Why can't some of you people just enjoy the movie for its entertainment? Is there a need to pick everything apart? Wahhh waahhh just another sequel to make more money. Ok? Who cares. I thought the dinosaurs were extinct in the first one. Again who cares!! Enjoy the freakin movie!

031606792X|3.0|This book had the potential to be so much more. I did thoroughly enjoy it, but I find myself drifting and not being totally sucked in by the end...I just wanted it to end.  First of all....I enjoyed the beginning right up until the pregnancy part started. After that, it become weird and Bella and Edward no longer connected for me anymore. Then Bella was turned and that was just awful.  Then the whole child which I think was stupid and then Jacob...it was just all weird and out of character and completely unexpected from there....  The build-up to the ending was interesting in the beginning ...especially with getting the fake Id's. Then the whole storyline plummeted into boring and ho-hum..  I'm disappointed, I expected a lot more.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a very enjoyable sci-fi adventure movie.  Set in 1939 New York, the basic plot revolves around the mysterious disappearance of a group of scientists that coincide with giant robot attacks on major cities across the world.  The prime suspect in these events is a Dr. Totenkopf (German for death's head and symbolized by a skull and crossbones).  Trying to get to the bottom of the plot is Joseph \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan (Jude Law) and reporter Polly Perkins (Gwenyth Paltrow).  Their journey takes them around the globe as they unravel mystery piece by piece until Totenkopf's plot reaches its climax at the end of the movie.  Along the way, they are assisted by Sky Captain's weapons specialist, Dax (Giovanni Ribisi) and Captain Francesca \\"Franky\\" Cook (Angelina Jolie).<br /><br />The plot movies along at a good pace after the opening sequence.  Law and Paltrow have good chemistry, but one would expect that as they have worked together previously.  Their banter back and forth is reminiscent of that of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fischer in the Star Wars movies.  Paltrow's Polly also has some Lois Lane qualities as she never forgets that she is after the story.  She also plays the Jimmy Olsen part as photographer, and she has trouble keeping up with her camera and film.  Law's Sky Captain comes off as the typical rogue hero character.  He is a vigilante in the vain of Batman; however, he is called by a special radio signal rather than the visual \\"bat signal\\".<br /><br />The visual effects of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow are likely to be polarizing.  The film was shot entirely on blue screen sets with all of the background filled in by digital artists and finished with an antique style.  It gives the movie somewhat of a whimsical tone and sets it apart as not of this world.  Viewers can gain a larger appreciation of how the film was put together through the special features \\"Brave New World I\\" and \\"Brave New World II\\".  These also give the story of how the movie came to be, and it seems writer/director Kerry Conran's 15 minutes of fame as the movie did not cover its budget.  However, the finances should not diminish what they accomplished.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is very enjoyable.  It is one that boys/men of all ages will like.  The special features are interesting and enrich the viewer's appreciation of the film that they have seen.<br /><br />Overall:  B+f how the movie came to be, and it seems writer/director Kerry Conran's 15 minutes of fame as the movie did not cover its budget.

B002BX4VEK|5.0|The significance of the recordings that Elvis Presley made in his hometown with legendary producer Chips Moman during the first two months of 1969 can never be overstated.  Given the often mediocre films he spent making at the almost dictatorial command of his manager the Colonel, and the even worse songs from those films that he was forced to sing, for much of the 1960s, he clearly had a lot on his plate that he wanted to get out there.  The NBC-TV special of December 1968, where he got back to his roots, was the key to his resurrection as the King.  And by returning to his proving grounds, to a producer whose American Studios was responsible for dozens of blue-eyed soul hits during the second half of the decade, he took recording seriously again, putting out arguably the best music of his entire life.    This Legacy Edition, in truth, is a 2-CD set that combines FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS (released in June 1969) with the underrated 1970 album BACK IN MEMPHIS (originally the second LP of the 2-LP late 1969 release FROM MEMPHIS TO VEGAS/FROM VEGAS TO MEMPHIS), along with four outtakes, and the mono releases of the classic hit singles (\\"In The Ghetto\\"; \\"Suspicious Minds\\"; \\"Don't Cry Daddy\\"; \\"Kentucky Rain\\") and B-sides (\\"Any Day Now\\"; \\"The Fair's Moving On\\"; \\"You'll Think Of Me\\"; \\"Rubberneckin'\\"; \\"My Little Friend\\"; \\"Mama Liked The Roses\\") that came from the sessions.  There is a certain melancholia in the knowledge that the success of both of the original albums was not enough to prevent a very savage conflict between the Colonel and the headstrong Moman that resulted in Elvis never returning to American Studios after these sessions.  Even so, the power and the energy that developed between Moman, Presley, and the American session crew is consistent in both recordings--and not just on the hits, either.  The portentous \\"Long Black Limousine\\", the tragic despair of \\"Without Love\\", and the down-low blues/funk of \\"Stranger In My Home Town\\" (where Elvis and the musicians areclearly having the time of their lives) show that Elvis was much, much more than a mere hit-making machine, but capable of making albums that showed off his love for American roots music, whether it was pop, gospel, R&B, country, or straight-forward rock and roll.    The sheer fact of history is that, while those of today's generation of radio listeners may deem the recently departed Michael Jackson as the King of Pop, Elvis was, and always will be, the true King.  And in this 2-CD collection of those two months spent on his own home ground, we see that greatness that lives on beyond his tragic demise on August 16, 1977.  If you're a true music lover, you really shouldn't miss this for anything.
B001RTP3Z0|1.0|The music is superb.  The video is horrible.  The video quality of the 4:3 aspect image is on par with a VHS tape that has been copied multiple times.  Shame on SONY.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|The first time I watched this movie I didn't know how I felt about it.  So the next day I watched it again, and walked away really loving it.  The special effects are cool, and it is not like any other superhero movie out there.  I think this is why I needed to watch it a second time.  The movie is extremely graphic both in violence and sexual content.  The movie is done in dark overtones, which tells you up front what kind of movie it will be.  Though I must say for the most part I think it worked for the movie, because as I said it is not like any other superhero movie out there.  The characters are flawed, and besides Dr. Manhattan they do not have any superpowers.  These are normal men and women dressing up in costumes and saving the day.    For me the best acting of this movie came from Carla Gugino, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan; these two were incredible in their roles.  I have been of fan of both actors for along time.  They seem to have the ability to play almost anything and they really brought these characters to life.  Jackie Earle Haley was another stand out actor for me.  Every scene he was in was amazing.  Patrick Wilson and Malin Akerman were also very good in their roles.  The chemistry between them really helped their characters.  Because of this movie I will never look at another superhero movie the same way again.    The only thing I can say bad about this movie is one thing.  Dr. Manhattan really should have worn pants or something at all times.  But like I said this movie is not for the weak of heart or those who blush easily.
1416550534|1.0|I kept hoping for more, but never got it. It was a struggle to finish and I was able to predict almost all of the plot.
B00260HH3K|5.0|I gave this movie five stars because I loved almost everything about it.  Now this movie has got mixed reviews and the reason is because it was several things before being put on the silver screen.  When you take something like a comic, cartoon and/or a videogame you can't put all that is great about it into the movie.  Many times because it is impossible for whatever reason.  Putting that aside the movie was great, and the effects were awesome.  James Marster and Chow Yun-Fat are two of the best actors because they can do just about any role.  They played their characters perfectly as did Justin Chatwin and Emmy Rossum.  This was the perfect coming of age story, about a teenager finding out who he is and deciding his destiny.  Is he only what he was born to be or can he be something greater--better.   The only issue I have with this movie was the romance between Goku and Chi Chi, because for me it seemed forced.  Not because the two actors did not have chemistry they did, I just thought it was a little rushed.  Like it was only put in there because they felt he needed to have a love interest.  I think that if people give this movie a chance and watch it for what it is supposes to be (entertainment) they will enjoy it.
0452295548|4.0|Neuropsychology sounds fascinating .  If we all had this level of understanding of the brain and a mother as devoted as Jill's, it may be possible to achieve her level of recovery .  Maybe if there were more neurologists and other specialists in this field as dedicated who became involved with patients at this level, some of the resulting impairment of a stroke could be reversed.  Hopefully many in her profession have the same level of knowledge, devotion and the dedication to go the extra mile for their patients.  It may not be a bad idea to give your own doctor a copy of the book next Christmas!

0312370849|1.0|I, too, was interested in the history of the French round up of their Jewish population.  That part of the book was done very effectively.  I had a real problem with the present day characters.  For one thing, the grandmother Mame was supposed to have Alzheimer's. I don't know what kind of Alzheimer's she had, but it is one I have not seen. For her memories to have been realistic, Mame would have to have been in the very beginning stages of the disease, so why was she put in a Home?    Also, the 11 year old daughter Zoe was the wisest kid I have yet to meet.  She was way ahead of her mother Julia.  And speaking of Julia, what was this obsession with the past?  The smartest kid ever, Zoe, told her mother to get over it and get on with life.    I finished the book, but would not recommend it.  Too many people marinating in a past over which, sadly, they have no control.  Yes, seeking out the family of one of the Jews rounded up was a wonderful gesture, but why did it need to consume the seekers lives?  It just did not add up for me.

0316017922|5.0|Gladwell persists in using the term outlier for what really boils down to analysis of success.  The real outliers, given his thesis, would be people who actually did achieve success without being in the right place and the right time with luck and connections.  I realize that is being picky, but it is sort of important to realize that Gladwell is not a scientist, and is not quite as logical and rigorous as he tries to appear.  That said, this is a fantastic book.  There are some very strong and important influences on us that have been raised and brought up in the United States,  immersed in the mythology of the self-made man, the rugged individualist, bootstrap pulling and all that, and Gladwell takes aim and deflates the \\"balloon\\"  of this mythology very well, very logically, very rigourously, if not scientifically, and very entertainingly.  The real import of the ideas in this book are just starting to be perceived, let alone understood, and I suspect it will be decades or centuries before the  ideas here will have any political effect on life on planet Earth or in the good old US of A.  When you understand the consequences and implications of these ideas so well presented by Gladwell it is clear that human potential of all kinds,  maybe the majority of human potential in the world is going to waste propping up the egos of those who were lucky.  I really do not mean to take away from most of the successful, lucky, or talented people, but the system that we all live under is built on a  bedrock of distortion untruth and force holds it all together.  Gladwell does not go this far in his book, he merely talks about some of the reasons  that are not visible or apparent why some people become so successful while others do not or just miss out.    I would hope that Gladwell at some point might extrapolate these ideas in the political and economic fields, but Outliers, despite it's oxymoronic  title is a very enlightening book that can and will change your thinking if you are open minded and subject to being enlightened.  That is a rare and  important quality that I look for in a book, and Gladwell is a master at this.  As always one has to be critical when reading these kinds of books, I  do not buy into everything Gladwell says, but for provoking thought and exercising one's mind, Gladwell, and this book in particular are useful.    What else can one ask for in a book but to expose the reader to new ways to see the world, that is why I rate Gladwell's \\"Outliers\\" 5/5.

The term \\"Jerk wad\\" is not something that young kids need to hear. Let alone the old burlesque dancers bobbing around in nothing but pasties and ginormus breasts!! It's definatly a disturbing story...to say the least! VERY VERY creepy for kids! I think it should have been rated PG-13!!

B000O59AFW|4.0|Having seen other blu ray reviews of this film, I actually decided to replace my original SD version with the blu ray one. I am very highly pleased; the blu ray transfer is very well done and a worthy addition to any BR collection.  Unlike many other reviewers, I enjoy this movie tremendously.  Sure its tom cruise and all of his scientology sillyness, but like it or not, he's pretty effective in these types of roles.  Anyway, good BR, great video and great audio.  Definitely worth an upgrade if you enjoy this movie anyway.

1400082773|5.0|I like to carry a paperback or magazines while traveling and I had been carrying - and slowly inching my way through - President Barak Obama's bestseller \\"Dreams from My Father\\"  for the past few weeks.  The book was in my list of must-read since Obama burst into national and international fame during the democratic primaries a couple of years ago, beating Hillary Clinton in a neck-to-neck race. Like many of my fellow Indian Americans and other cheerleaders of globalization, I have been in awe of the Obama phenomena for a while. It has been over six months since he was sworn in as the president of America, ushered in with much hope for change. And some, at least in the media seem to be getting over the initial euphoria, the honeymoon phase that newly elected leaders are generally accorded. This, I thought was the perfect time to squeeze some Mojo and finish the book.    I was fascinated by Obama's candid narrative of his eclectic upbringing and most importantly the way in which he shares intimate details of the discovery of his father's background.     The early chapters focus on his Origins, a bit about his upbringing in Indonesia, life with his grandparents in Hawaii, getting into the prestigious Punahou school, getting into Harvard; and a young Harvard graduate inspired to work in the projects in Chicago. The second half of the book is on Obama's journey to Keyna to discover his \\"Roots,\\" perhaps a personification of the urge that Blacks in America, and immigrants everywhere have in attempting to discover their backgrounds while trying to reconcile the reality of their present.  Obama's honest description of the skeletons that he discovers in his father's past, though a bit jarring to my middle-class-Indian-upbringing, makes one reflect on aspects of human relationships.     Now over to reading The Audacity of Hope!

B001TOD92C|5.0|Great movie.  If it hadn't been for a respected friend that lent it to me, I wouldn't have thought twice about seeing a movie about a pro wrestler.  I've come to appreciate stuff Rourke has done in his later years, but I'll pass on a lot of his earlier stuff.  So it was with some surprise that I watched this subject go from that of laughable joke to serious art.  It's the behind the scenes look at wrestling which make the film so interesting in fact.  Not to mention Rourke himself and the very credible world of make believe (wrestling..) that we're thrown into.  It's that world of make-believe coming up against reality when the star realizes he's getting too old to work in the only field he knows and loves (one-trick pony) - art mirroring life?  Maybe.  5 stars anyway.
B000301YY8|5.0|A very good debut album. Yes, he sings like a girl, even he says so but there is something about his voice that is easy to listen to and you do not get tired of it. All the songs are good. Not a clunker in the bunch. Great to see real music being made.

I know some of his more recent films like \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" were more well rounded, but I was already too turned off by the gratuitous violence of his earlier films; but he always was, and is, his own man.<br />But shockingly to me, Gran Torino brought Clint, and his career, to a much more conciliatory, and ironically peaceful. higher ground through his enlightening encounter with Hmong culture.<br /><br />Prior to seeing GT, I had read a book on the Hmong culture, Anne Fadiman's \\"The Spirit Catches You and You all Fall down.\\"  They had been an independent ethnic thorn in the side to the Han Chinese dynasties for centuries, before being forced to migrate to the highlands of Laos. During the Vietnam War they were offered various trinkets by the US military invaders to aid them in that awful war. Well,(General) Westmoreland and his cronies, as they often did with their imperialist insensitive inhumanity, did not keep their word and the Hmongs were bombed out of the Laotian highland home- they had always been mountain people. Well to make a long and gruesome story short, these proud people were exiled to the total alien, via squalid refugee camps, American Culture. One family ended up as neighbors of the aged Dirty Harry like character played by Eastwood in a bombed out Detroit, which was symbolically not all that dissimilar to the war ravaged Laos the Huongs were forced to leave.<br /><br />We initially see the Eastwood character (Walt Kowalski, Kowalski was the name of the pre-eminent \\"wrastler.\\" Killer Kowalsi, of the 1950's) left alone with his only contact being with his vulturistic, superficial children, and his memories of Korea and his recently deceased wife. Then the \\"gooks\\" (the Hmongs) moved next store. Initially Kawalski sees his Hmong neighbors as another assault on the world  of his past, when Detroit, Ford and GM were great. However, we slowly start to see similarities between Kowalski and his Hmong neighbors, who both were exiles from an earlier more triumphant  time, and both were trying to hang on to their crumbling cultural identities. At first, Kowalski, in his usual hard ass (Eastwood) fashion rejects the friendly overtures of his neighbors, but soon he succumbs to their charm, honesty, innocence and authenticity. He becomes a protector and mentor to his neighbors and their children- particularly against the Hmong male gangs that were destroying their American born son. These conflicts were interspersed with moments of humor (e.g.,the thank you party for his protecting them). The transition comes full circle in the final scene when Kowalski doesn't \\"bring his guns to town,\\" with his hardened heart being opened by his encounters with his proud and humble neighbors. It certainly did, as Dirty Harry once said, \\"make my day.\\"<br /><br />This film can be viewed on many levels. It is a story of a man accepting change and diversity at an age when most people would prefer to dwell on their memories. On a more profound level, Gran Torino suggests the possibility of global unification, or at least respect, of diverse cultures and an unconditional acceptance of \\"the other,\\" no matter how different they seem on the surface. This was definitely the movie of the year. Moreover, in my opinion, this is Eastwood's most socially conscious and finest film; as Elvis Costello once sang, and this could have been part of the soundtrack ,\\"What's so funny bout peace, love, and understanding?\\"when Detroit, Ford and GM were great.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|This flash is everything and then some.  Do not believe the reviews that complain about the thermal shutdown.  It must be a battery issue.  I put new Energizer Advanced Lithium batteries in there and have shot about 3000 pictures on it so far, including 531 action pictures today in the time frame of 30 minutes.  Not once did I have a shutdown, however, the batteries are almost dead.  I also have not done a firmware update or anything.  So I don't know if it's an early adopter issue (since I just got this a month ago) or a battery issue, but not complaints here.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This first season of True Blood was a joy to watch.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed it wholeheartedly.  This show is a great ride.  We had never seen the show until we bought the DVD.  Now we can't wait to see more from season two!
B001CD6FKI|4.0|I gave this as a gift to my godson and his brother (4 and 7) as part of their birthday present. I had previously given them the Speed Racer cartoons I grew up with to introduce them to the original stories.    I didn't get to watch it with them but their reviews of it when asked were simultaneous \\"awesome\\"s.
B0017YDPI2|4.0|As much as I love the show and would naturally give it top marks, the blu-ray menu is buggered. You cannot select individual episodes, and the menu button will only take you into the extras menu, with no way to go elsewhere other than back to the episode it thinks you're watching. You want episode six on disc one, fast forward and skip through the first five. Yes, it really is that bad!    I pre-ordered mine, maybe early sets were screwed up and later runs were fixed? If anyone has them on blu-ray and they have proper access to the episodes, please shout and let me know Warner have fixed their mistake. Hopefully I'd be able to get them to swap these duff ones for what the product should have been, and then give this product the five stars the show deserves.    As for this season itself, it's excellent. Good script, acting and themes, plus the duo's humor, make this one hell of a show.    UPDATE: After looking around online I've discovered that perhaps the menu isn't broken, but someone took the brain-dead decision to not implement episode selection from the main menu. However, when you have an episode playing, selecting the pop-up menu will let you jump to another episode. I'd bump the star rating up to 3 with this information, but review editing doesn't currently allow for a change :(    Roll on season 5!
B000002HH2|5.0|In the 1990s, after being weaned in Melbourne's ultraconservative suburbs on the commercial music of the eighties, I began to be frustrated by the loud, thrashy noise of terrible alternative bands like [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nirvana]], [[ASIN:B000002B86 Silverchair]], and worst of all [[ASIN:B0018PJESU the Presidents of the United States of America]]. Australia's middle 1990s charts also contained equally dreadful techno bands like [[ASIN:B000002HJF Corona]], [[ASIN:B000002VOY the Real McCoy]] JX and [[ASIN:B00006JRZ1 the Outhere Brothers]] who were making it difficult for me to know where to turn except to old favourites from the eighties that I had not heard since leaving Ashwood in 1989.<br /><br />In my youth, living in a place where political incorrectness is a completely unspoken way of life and people listen only to music that will not hurt them emotionally, I did not read - or have much opportunity to read - music reviews. Only in my last year of school when I was beginning to be annoyed by the music on both commercial and noncommercial radio did I read music criticism for the first time. One of the first reviews I recall reading was of Bjork's second solo album, \\"Post\\", which was rated by The Age's \\"EG\\" as one of the best albums of 1995, by which time it had already become her most commercially successful album on the Australian charts, eventually reaching the Top Ten a second time after the success of \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\". At the time, I had heard \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" on the radio frequently and utterly detested it, thinking it the same tuneless noise with which Nirvana and Silverchair were polluting the airwaves and making me turn to \\"easy listening\\" music that my no-nonsense brother was calling \\"terrible\\" and which I soon knew critics to hate.<br /><br />In the following year, I read an increasing amount of music criticism and came to admire preceding eccentric women [[ASIN:B0013FSV6G Kate Bush]] and [[ASIN:B000068QZP Laura Nyro]], and I felt that I should check out Bjork despite my dislike of \\"Post\\" when it came onto the radio in 1995: the descriptions appealed to me much more than what I had heard half a decade before. Finding a cheap copy in a discount store in central Melbourne, I was surprised by what I heard even though I might have unconsciously heard \\"Army of Me\\" on Triple J or Rage. From that day, I realised that I had made a mistake about Bjork. \\"Post\\" was never a noise feast in the same way as Nirvana or Silverchair or Corona: the music is instead dense and fierce yet, like Laura Nyro's \\"Tendaberry\\", extremely catchy. \\"Army of Me\\" is a superb opener with one of the most fierce vocals ever seen in modern music. The power with which Bjork sings, even at a volume that is far from a shout, is wonderful and the simple, even austere music makes her fierce emotional desire even more explicit. Second track and last single \\"Hyperballad\\" is much softer yet its beauty is strange yet so far from the ugliness of the predominant grunge and techno I was exposed to in the 1990s. Rather, the electronics are even melodic and quiet, and on third track \\"The Modern Things\\" Bjork satirises modern life - a theme she would take further particularly on [[ASIN:B00005NG4X Vespertine]].<br /><br />With age, I can even appreciate the hit single \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" for its dramatic dynamics, but more distinctly impressive in the way her voice tightens on \\"Enjoy\\" to create a breakdown like nothing else. The touching, sparkling \\"I Miss You\\" is really intimate and beautiful in a way you would never expect with an electronic act, and the sound on closer \\"Headphones\\" is wonderfully experimental in the truest way. The lyrics of \\"Isobel\\" are an amazing look at the desire for solitude and rhyme in a poetic manner that I did not recognise when first buying the album. The \\"na, na, na\\" outro fits in with the feeling of beautiful solitude perfectly. \\"Cover Me\\", teh second-last and shortest track, is yet another wonderful surprise in which Bjork manages toperfectly integrate a one-note harpsichord into her unique sound without losing anything. The imagination in the few lyrics of \\"Cover Me\\" make it a little known masterpiece even perhaps to Bjork's fans.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Post\\", even if very much an acquired taste, stands out as one of the very best albums of the 1990s. It is more unconventional and even more pasisonate than [[ASIN:B000002HCO Bjork's first solo album]] and in her quest to create more intimate sounds later on she did many wonderful things but never reached the same emotional level.

The story is chilling, romantic, funny and mysterious all at the same time. This is, in my opinion, a book worth reading (and re reading). A plus is the quality of the writing which really gives the book a sophisticated feel making it a really enjoyable read. I think this book is for pretty much for any reader who is willing to get lost in the pages of good story. I must warn you: Once you start reading this book it will be hard to put it down and at the end you might shed a few tears.

I admit when Alice was introduced at the start of the movie.. I was shaking  my head and thought \\"Oh god the screwed it up all ready.  Thinking  who the hell is she? since the character is not in the games.      But aside from that it turned out to be a great movie with  the elements of the game. Alice is a good solid character and reminds me of Angelina Jolie's Lara  Croft  from The Tomb  Rider movies.      The basis of the story was simular with the first games storyline aside from a few slight changes here and there. but All in all it was a exciting  Zombie movie and I  enjoyed it..

B001P06GX4|5.0|This is one of those games that adults like to play as much as the kids so you won't mind playing it over and over again.  Great for pre-schoolers too as they can easily grasp the concept of placing the pieces corner to corner as per the game rules.  When not playing a game, mine also like to just put the colorful pieces on the board.  This is a game I think younger kids can grow into as there are many different levels of complexity to this board game - from playing with the pieces to the competitive strategist.  Who knew such a simple concept for a board game can be so much fun for everyone.

It was his voice she heard calling her name after she escaped out of the window that cold January night. She even testified against him in court. But did he? And if he didn't, why isn't he trying to appeal his prison sentence?<br /><br />It's twenty five years later. Money Libby had in a trust from donations over the years is running out. Mentally and emotionally, she can't handle a job. As a means to get some cash, she agrees to meet with a group of true crime fans called The Kill Club. They are willing to pay her for her time. Their goal is to set her brother free. They believe Libby might have some information to help. Up until now, she's believed her brother was the murderer. After the meeting, she wasn't so sure anymore. She and a member of the club, Lyle, work to uncover clues.<br /><br />To give the reader a multidimensional view of what happened, the story is told from Libby's point of view now, but that of her mother's, Patty Day, and Ben's with a surprise voice close to the end that will bring the story full circle. The way the story flips back and forth is so smooth, so real, and so chilling. This is a work of dark fiction that surpasses the author's previous book, SHARP OBJECTS. A must read for thriller fans.

B00003CX95|4.0|What a great film!  As far as historical war/battle epics go this has surely got to be among the top 5 films ever.  At almost 3 hours long you'd be forgiven having squeaky bum syndrome but this is no ordinary film and I never even noticed the time as I was enthralled!  The sound quality coming in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sounded great on my system and the picture quality was good overall although it could have been better as tiny black spots remained on too many of the frames.  The special features are rather sparse as well although a decent making-of documentary is included in addition to 2 theatrical trailers.  Interesting indeed to see what the Blu-ray version will look like when it eventually comes out.<br /><br />It's hard not to like a film that allows us to root for the massive underdog as he proves that one man can make a difference and all that is needed is courage and desire that eventually overcomes treachery and wanton evil: \\"every man dies, not every man really lives.\\"  Gibson is excellent as Wallace and was a deserving winner of the Best Director Oscar.<br /><br />No film library should be without this great film.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 5 Sep 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not allow me to do this separately, I'll have to append this here: the Sapphire Blu-ray release of this great film is certainly worth the upgrade from the standard dvd format that I reviewed above.  Both the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved and especially the special feature documentaries making this the definitive version of the film to view.  The only thing that would have made this perfect for me is if it was released as a digibook.  Other than that, this blu-ray release is certainly a step up over the dvd and is worthy of the double-dip.<br /><br />Recommended!

A very compelling movie, it deals with the government's ability to monitor citizens' every movement, financial transaction, what they buy and possibly even deduce their thoughts through a \\"super computer\\" program that the British government is attempting to implement. Throw in some shady characters, all with unknown agendas and the threat of a possible biological attack you have several hours of great entertaimnent. Be prepared to sit down and watch this movie from beginning to end because once it grabs your interest you can't wait to see the outcome. Great acting, interesting characters and a well produced DVD make this a very entertaining and worthwhile investment. There are many plot surprises along the way so don't think you have this figured out until the end. One of the best TV dramas I have seen in quite awhile.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I initially begged off seeing \\"Gran Torino\\" as I assumed I got the gist from preview trailers, but you know what happens when you assume, right?  I was expecting the clich&eacute;d Clint Eastwood ending and after seeing \\"Gran Torino\\" was instead quite stunned and surprised, yet I shouldn't have been.  If anything Eastwood has evolved far beyond the \\"Dirty Harry\\" days and if anything has become as much as an artist in front of the lens as behind it.  Thinking of his more recent movies, Eastwood has transcended his earlier on-screen personas and evolved into something far deeper.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is as much character driven as plot driven and Eastwood's character Harvey Kowalski is as much the antithesis of Dirty Harry as he is the antithesis of a vigilante.  A retired autoworker and Korean War Veteran, Kowalski is also a recent widower watching the transition and decline of his Detroit neighborhood where he and his late wife raised their children.  When touching on his somewhat estranged children \\"Gran Torino\\" becomes a vehicle for satire, emphasizing the dislocation and detachment of modern society.  Kowalski feels about as connected to his children and grandchildren as he does to the equally alien Hmong family next door.  Opening with the funeral service for his late wife \\"Gran Torino\\" sets the tableau of dislocation and despair in his neighborhood.  Kowalski's antagonism and dislocation with seemingly everyone is pled out with his neighbors, his children, the parish priest, and his neighborhood.  The feelings of rejection and helplessness pervade the movie: children give up on parents, parents give up on children, neighbors give up on their community and the community crumbles around them.  Without giving the plot away events unfold where Kowalski feels compelled to intervene on behalf of his neighbors and the community reacts in a way that catches Kowalski off-guard.  Slowly Kowalski is pulled closer into the Hmong community as he grapples with his wartime demons and his distant children.  The closer Kowalski gets to the Hmong the more the film builds to its stunning climax, and the climax is unlike anything you'd expect form a Clint Eastwood movie.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the ending, but much like \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" and other recent Eastwood movies your mouth will be hanging open as it is not the ending you would expect.  That's because Eastwood has truly become the cinematic master, defying expectations and here offering up a sharp contrast that made me a fan of his work all over again.  There wasn't as much violence as I expected, and Eastwood totally chews up the scenery with an economy of words that are truly impressive.  His facial expressions communicate more than words ever could.  There is some VERY politically incorrect language presented quite frankly here but it serves a purpose.  I'd questioned how good \\"Gran Torino\\" could be and it is easily one of the best movies of the past year, if not one of Eastwood's best.  It is a fitting coda to every Dirty Harry movie and all of his Spaghetti Westerns rolled into one.

B0019LY5I2|3.0|My wife and I recently made plans to go check out a movie with another couple.  When differences arose on which movie we were to see, \\"G.I. Joe:  The Rise of Cobra\\" became the choice of compromise.  Despite having played with G.I. Joe toys and watching the cartoon series when I was young, I fully planned to wait for this film to hit the DVD shelves before I watched it.  There just wasn't anything too appealing about it based on the previews.<br /><br />Having now viewed it I must say that it was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The plot is rather simple.  In this film, James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston), an arms dealer with a checkered family history, joins forces with a sinister scientist known only as The Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and the duo plan to take over the world by threatening it with nanomite weapons.  These weapons can literally eat through metal (and pretty much everything else).  When a convoy of these weapons, led by two soldiers codenamed Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans), is attacked and the nano-weapons are stolen, the international force known as G.I. Joe is sent to retrieve them.<br /><br />From that point on, the film is basically one CGI-laced battle after another.  Fight sequences go from the Joe headquarters to France to the icy waters of the North Pole.  Hand-to-hand combat, \\"accelerator\\" suits, ninjas, computerized crossbows, etc. all take center stage as the action spills out on the screen.<br /><br />Like many other big-budget action yarns this film suffers in a number of areas.  Heading the list of things that are wrong with this film is Channing Tatum.  He tries to come across as a leader but instead looks more like a lightweight John Cena (WWE).  Tatum ain't no Duke, and his performance here goes to show that his poor delivery in \\"Havoc\\" was no misstep on his part.  Another thing wrong with this film is the fact that it's covered in cheese.  Granted, it's based on a toyline from the 80's, but it would have been nice if the film had been taken a bit more seriously.  Otherwise, the scriptwriters should have gotten rid of some of the strong language and aimed for a more kid-friendly PG rating.<br /><br />I also found that despite the busy nature of the film, it was rather boring at times.  With little character development, it became nothing more than a \\"that explosion was cool, but wait until you see the next one\\" series of CGI sequences.<br /><br />There's plenty that's bad about this film, but there is also quite a bit that is good.  As nothing more than an action film, it works wonders.  The CGI does look excellent and the numerous vehicles and weapons that are used in the film turned out great.<br /><br />Although Tatum was miscast as Duke, the majority of the other characters were given decent representations.  Mired in bad one-liners, Dennis Quaid gives a good performance as Hawk.  Christopher Eccleston is sufficient as McCullen/Destro, but much like Quaid he has to swim his way through bad writing.  Rachel Nichols (Scarlett) gives one of the best performances in the film, and Said Taghmaoui is quite enjoyable as Breaker.  Sienna Miller filled out the Baroness' black suit quite well, but her delivery was only average.<br /><br />Other actors who did quite well were Ray Park as the silent and deadly Snake Eyes, Lee Byung-hun as Snake Eyes' arch enemy, Stormshadow and Arnold Vosloo in a small but sinister role as Zartan.<br /><br />Two actors in particular deserve kudos for their performances in this film.  When I first saw that Marlon Wayans was going to portray Ripcord, I immediately smelled a stinky film.  However, Wayans does surprisingly well as the humorous Ripcord.  Deserving even more praise is Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  Although he wasn't perfect as the Doctor/Cobra Commander, he has shown marked improvement from his \\"Havoc\\" and \\"Ten Things I Hate About You\\" days.  He was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />There are also a few old faces that pop up.  Director Stephen Sommers reached deep into his \\"The Mummy\\" bag and pulled out Vosloo, Brendan Fraser in a cameo role and Kevin J. O'Connor as Dr. Mindbender.  Screen veteran Jonathan Pryce (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" \\"Twelve Monkeys\\") plays the President of the United States.<br /><br />Overall, \\"G.I. Joe:  The Rise of Cobra\\" is a mixed bag of great action sequences and solid individual performances weighed down by a poor choice for a leading man, a dull script and too much focus on the \\"wow\\" factor.  If you like pop, sizzle, and bang in your movies, \\"Joe\\" is an excellent film to check out.

B000V86OKG|5.0|While Season One of \\"Dexter\\" ended in a seemingly neat tidy bundle there were unanswered questions: would Dexter kill again, would the secret of Dexter's past come to light, were Dexter's victims about to start coming to the surface?  Having dispatched the Ice Truck Killer, it would seem Dexter had found some peace, but instead he's as troubled as ever.  Worse still, his nemesis Detective Doakes (played with icy intensity by Erik King) will give him no quarter.  Dexter's problems start surfacing quite quickly and quite literally as the season begins and his problems only compound from there.  The FBI arrives to complicate matters, Dexter's problems with Rita and her ex-husband come to a head, and it seems even Dexter's sister Deb may be turning on him.  The ever-present Detective Doakes looms large and there's a twist: Dexter is in Narcotics Anonymous but he isn't an addict. Or is he?  It's hard to describe much of the season without giving away plot lines and spoiling the stunning season finale.  As before, has Dexter escaped his past cleanly?  Has he left a clue behind that will expose him? Has he continued to commit the perfect crimes or has he slipped up?  Will he kill again?<br /><br />\\"Dexter\\" clearly falls in to the category of public fascination with vigilantism and revenge, whether it's the \\"Death Wish\\" series with Charles Bronson or subway killer Bernard Goetz.  In many respects \\"Dexter\\" pays homage to the psychological thrillers of Hitchock and Poe as it does to the pulp fiction of the 1950s and the \\"Dirty Harry\\" series.  In the process we come to question our own sense of right and wrong, of vengeance and forgiveness.  Are we really like Dexter or are we truly all that different?  \\"Dexter\\" has probably one of the best ensemble casts on television and the writing is first rate.  While not ostensibly a gore-fest, \\"Dexter\\" can be a tad more graphic or violent than some viewers would like.  I've found it to be riveting and compelling viewing for its profoundly revelatory exploration of our deeper darker emotions and beliefs; a journey that may ultimately be more disturbing but also cathartic and revealing.atory exploration of our deeper darker emotions and beliefs; a journey that may ultimately be more disturbing but also cathartic and revealing.
B0028SVXR6|2.0|I was sorely disappointed by this album.  I understand that a band like Mars Volta is going to be creative and explore other genres, but this is such a 180 degree turn from Bedlam that I was just left waiting for the band to rock out during each track.... the only problem is they never do.  It's an average collection of non-memorable slow song meanderings.  I loved their last album so much I bought this one sight unseen.  Never again.  I will definitely listen to all future tracks from M. Volta before purchasing.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Based on Jeff Lindsay's novel \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter,\\" the series follows the on-duty and off-duty exploits of Dexter Morgan (played with gleeful &eacute;lan by Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department.  On the surface that doesn't sound that interesting but there's a twist: Dexter is a secretive serial killer hiding in the plain sight of his job.  But Dexter isn't just any serial killer; he's a killer with a code, killing only other killers who the justice system has let go, presumably to kill again.  Early on we learn of Dexter's modus operadi as he investigates and is drawn to another serial killer: the Ice Truck Killer.  A lethal game of cat and mouse plays out over the season as Dexter learns not only more about the Ice Truck Killer, but about his own past.  Adopted by a policeman who teaches Dexter his code of conduct, views slowly come to understand how Dexter came to be who he is.<br /><br />Without spoiling the plotlines, Dexter spends season one avoiding exposure by the Ice Truck Killer while attempting to catch him before he can kill again.  In the process Dexter catches the attention of the relentless Detective Doakes (played with great intensity by Erik King).  The climactic season finale ends with the d&eacute;nouement of the Ice Truck Killer, but unanswered questions abound: will Dexter get caught, will his past be revealed, and will Dexter kill again?<br />It's rare to root for a serial killer, let alone to empathize with his motivations and actions, and \\"Dexter\\" seeks to explore the darker realms within all viewers: what is truly good and what is truly evil?  Is there a bright-line where killing is warranted?  What masks do we wear?  What do we choose to reveal and to keep hidden?<br /><br />Quite simply \\"Dexter\\" is unlike anything else on television or film.  In some respects \\"Dexter\\" is an homage to Edgar Allen Poe, Alfred Hitchcock and the gothic genre of writing, and in some respects Dexter's closeted-ness draws parallels to other marginalized subcultures.  The ensemble cast is superb, particularly Hall and King, and the writing allows glimpses into the personal lives of the other characters that fleshes them out rather than leaving them as two-dimensional caricatures.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|I initially begged off seeing \\"Gran Torino\\" as I assumed I got the gist from preview trailers, but you know what happens when you assume, right?  I was expecting the clich&eacute;d Clint Eastwood ending and after seeing \\"Gran Torino\\" was instead quite stunned and surprised, yet I shouldn't have been.  If anything Eastwood has evolved far beyond the \\"Dirty Harry\\" days and if anything has become as much as an artist in front of the lens as behind it.  Thinking of his more recent movies, Eastwood has transcended his earlier on-screen personas and evolved into something far deeper.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is as much character driven as plot driven and Eastwood's character Harvey Kowalski is as much the antithesis of Dirty Harry as he is the antithesis of a vigilante.  A retired autoworker and Korean War Veteran, Kowalski is also a recent widower watching the transition and decline of his Detroit neighborhood where he and his late wife raised their children.  When touching on his somewhat estranged children \\"Gran Torino\\" becomes a vehicle for satire, emphasizing the dislocation and detachment of modern society.  Kowalski feels about as connected to his children and grandchildren as he does to the equally alien Hmong family next door.  Opening with the funeral service for his late wife \\"Gran Torino\\" sets the tableau of dislocation and despair in his neighborhood.  Kowalski's antagonism and dislocation with seemingly everyone is pled out with his neighbors, his children, the parish priest, and his neighborhood.  The feelings of rejection and helplessness pervade the movie: children give up on parents, parents give up on children, neighbors give up on their community and the community crumbles around them.  Without giving the plot away events unfold where Kowalski feels compelled to intervene on behalf of his neighbors and the community reacts in a way that catches Kowalski off-guard.  Slowly Kowalski is pulled closer into the Hmong community as he grapples with his wartime demons and his distant children.  The closer Kowalski gets to the Hmong the more the film builds to its stunning climax, and the climax is unlike anything you'd expect form a Clint Eastwood movie.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the ending, but much like \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" and other recent Eastwood movies your mouth will be hanging open as it is not the ending you would expect.  That's because Eastwood has truly become the cinematic master, defying expectations and here offering up a sharp contrast that made me a fan of his work all over again.  There wasn't as much violence as I expected, and Eastwood totally chews up the scenery with an economy of words that are truly impressive.  His facial expressions communicate more than words ever could.  There is some VERY politically incorrect language presented quite frankly here but it serves a purpose.  I'd questioned how good \\"Gran Torino\\" could be and it is easily one of the best movies of the past year, if not one of Eastwood's best.  It is a fitting coda to every Dirty Harry movie and all of his Spaghetti Westerns rolled into one.  I've often thought that Eastwood approaches each film as though it might be his last and never holds anything back.  If \\"Gran Torino\\" were to be his final film it would be hard to imagine going out on a better note!is distant children.

B000002J2D|4.0|Genesis enters there middle era with just Phil, Tony & Mike.  This is a great album - songs, arrangements, etc.  Down and Out starts the album out with a bang.  There is some beautiful music in Snowbound, Undertow and Burning Rope.  Epic progrock in Ballad of Big.  I find a few moments of unneveness, notably in \\"Say It's Alright Joe\\" - not my favorite.  But all in all, this is album is a great effort - one that I keep returning to as the years go by.

B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth have come to be known as a giant in progressive metal.  But, they are also akin to death metal, too, and they do what they do better than anyone else.  There are a lot of bands out there that could learn something about music from this band, that it doesn't have to absolutely annihilate the listener to be enjoyed.  Not even in metal.  One of the main reasons, often overlooked, why Metallica was heralded in the 80s was because they made great solid musically great songs.  They weren't merely thrash.  They built great songs through a sort of concept of instrument play, and they were very interesting.    So it is with the current masters of metal, Opeth.  But, they go a lot further than Metallica ever did.  Opeth builds the tension of a song with grand sweeping gestures of joy and depression. You don't know from one minute to the next if you should cheer or sigh.  The dynamic of the song flow in most Opeth songs is unbelievably emotional and stirring, and when you add to it a sense of real metal power, well it makes the idea invented in Metallica's \\"Fade to Black\\" come alive on an almost orchestral level.  It is simply amazing music.    I have myself held back for two years (the time I've been listening to Opeth) on doing any kind of review of their albums because I wanted to first experience the full Opeth impression before I talked.  Because, you cannot simply describe an Opeth song to someone who's never heard one.  There is literally little else at all like them in all of music, and most of those are pale shades of the real thing. Opeth are every bit to metal music now what Metallica was 23 years ago (as of 2009).  And a lot more.    To the album.  Deliverance is easily Opeth's heaviest work.  It starts powerfully from Wreath and barely lets up all the way through to By the Pain I See in Others.  It has shivering melodies tied in with crushing grooves and it all melts perfectly into a sonic rush of sound that any music fan can utterly enjoy.  Opeth have perfected musical enjoyment for the art of heavy metal.  A Fair Judgement is filled with tremendous melodic buildup to an amazingly heavy and robust finishing riff.  Deliverance is crushing and devastating.  Master's Apprentices opens with one of the most evil metal riffs I've ever heard.    If you are considering buying an Opeth album, as a metal fan, then get this one.  Give yourself time to get used to Opeth.  If you are a fan of great music, all I can say is buy this, and enjoy.  Music lovers will not be disappointed in this album.
B000UBMSB8|2.0|Like many other movies that came out during the 1980s, I only recently watched Blade Runner, for the first time, a few years ago.  I guess that you can say that either I'm extremely naive...or have lived a very 'sheltered' life.<br /><br />Before watching Blade Runner for the first time, I had the impression (based on countless reviews by critics and the general public) that it was one of the most underrated and greatest sci-fi movies of all time.  After having...'somehow' (*cough*) managed to force myself to watch the entire movie, my impression of the intelligence of mankind lowered exponentially -as it has many times in recent years, needless to say.<br /><br />Blade Runner starts out as an eery sci-fi flic showing potential that it may well, indeed, turn out to paint a very original, accurate and ominous portrayal of the future: The futuristically-rendered city-scapes are very well done (even for the present year, 2009, they still don't look very dated), the synthesizer palettes by Vangelis create an ominous atmosphere that goes well with the beginning of the the movie...and some of the first scenes seem to suggest that the movie will be very futuristic and intellectual in a number of ways.  Once the miscast droning dialogue from Harrison Ford (who plays Rick Deckard, a detective who's narrative dialogue is supposed to sound intelligent, but comes across as that of a dumb rogue more befitting of Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark) enters the movie...it goes downhill...very quickly...<br /><br />Rick Deckard's mission is to eliminate \\"replicants.\\"  After the first half hour of the film (the only part of the film that has anything intellectual, thematic, or atmospheric going for it), the entire plot goes downhill very quickly and the remainder of the film focuses on Harrison Ford chasing replicants, being chased by replicants, and fighting replicants.  Instead of being awash with atmosphere, mystery, and futuristic city-renderings, the film is awash with sleazy '80s dance-fight choreography, dark-colored gothic make-up, and gore.  The dialogue and action from this point on is graphic, pointless, and pain-fully redundant...a pointless exercise in futility.  For THIS part of the movie (the majority of the film), Rutger Hauer is WONDERFULLY-CAST (as opposed to \\"mis-cast\\") as the proto-typical sleaze-gore '80s villain -something akin to a SUPER-rebellious Billy Idol...exept with MORE makeup and possessing decent fighting skills.  By the end of the movie, you're wondering why the heck did I spend two hours or so watching this sleaze-schlock nonsense...and what the hell was the purpose of it?<br /><br />How the general public AND critics (look at the PLETHORA of 5-star reviews on this website, alone!) overwhelmingly rate this movie as even \\"marginally-good\\"...much less \\"GREAT\\"...is way beyond me...(or is it \\"below\\" me?).  Is there something about the opening music and city renderings of this film...that creates an atmosphere that 'stays' with them throughout the remainder of the film?  Is it that most people watched Blade Runner when it came out in 1982 (I only saw it for the first time ever recently), times were different, and although the movie is NOW wonderfully-dated and overrated, they still have the same impression of the movie?<br /><br />In my opinion, Blade Runner isn't a \\"terrible\\" movie...but is certainly not good either, and a movie, which I believe can...and should be parodied...or at the very least submitted to Mystery Science Theater (for the take on Harrison Ford's 'dumb-sounding' dialogue narration, or Rutger Hauer's overtly-explicit sleaze antics, among others).

B001G6RB7C|5.0|The previous reviewer railed against the Alan Parsons Project for quoting from Claude Debussy without acknowledging the debt. For centuries, composers have been \\"borrowing\\" from each other to create new music.  Igor Stravinsky was notable in acknowledging he did \\"steal\\" some music from other composers but the art was knowing from whom and when to do the theft.    Copyrighted music does require acknowledgement (and payment) to a composer whose music is incorporated into a new composition. (Remember all the hoopla with rap and hip-hop sampling music of others?) I do not know if Debussy's music is in the public domain or not.  Perhaps the Alan Parsons Project should have made an nod to Debussy apparent in the credits, but should we fault the artist for using this music in a new fashion?  I think not.    When Keith Emerson borrowed from Bartok, there was not one whit of a mention until reissues of the self-titled album.  It was certainly acknowledged for years in trade publications and Keith never said he did not use Bartok.  Does it make the music worse?  Do you find it disturbing that a musician may not be completely original in the composition, yet is original in the use of the themes from another composer?  Do you think it was an intentional rip off?    I think that you enjoyed the album, anyway, is a testament to Alan Parsons ability to produce pleasing and, yes, original music.  Perhaps it was an oversight. But, in no instance should it detract from a great release as this.

0439813786|5.0|This book to me is a pure work of genius!  It is part novel, part graphic novel, and 100% entertaining.  This is one of the best stories I've read, ever.  It is a young adults book, but I have no doubt that this will be a classic along the lines of Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz.  It is a fantastic journey about a young boy left alone in the world(1930's Paris) who discovers truths about himself, the world, and a very old film maker.  What I enjoyed is that the text would end spontaneously and the pictures would pick up the tale and relay events with such detail it was beautiful.  It would then resume back to text without a glance and it worked!  It was a delight to read and I hope all of you pick it up.

6305907145|5.0|Let go of your need for an exact retelling of Austen's novel and you will love this movie.  The flawless acting, directing, whimsical editing and music, settings, etc. are all extraordinary.      At their core, Austen's novels are all \\"cautionary tales that end happily for those who follow the rules [of an ordered world and polite society] and badly for those who don't.\\"   As in the book, the story is centered on Fanny Price, modest, reserved (except with her cousin Edmund) and courageously and steadfastly moral.  Yes, there are some added background stories, \\"moods\\" and character variations in this movie, but it is absolutely true to Austen's core theme.    Consider the added background story of slavery.  In Austen's England, slavery was a highly charged political issue and not universally considered a black and white moral issue.  Today, thank God, it is.   We know that Austen's novels didn't deal with political issues, but in today's world to watch a movie that blithely referred to, and in so doing condoned, Sir Thomas Bertram's business in the West Indies would have been a bit painful (even considering the morals of the period) when we now know that the West Indies were at the heart of the slave trade and rife with many of the most inhumane practices.  So the addition worked for me.  It felt consistent with the theme of condemning what is bad and upholding good.  Not very Austen in subject or mood, but entirely in theme.  What's more, few Austen movies do justice to Austen's wit.  The writing and directing of the last scene - sharing final glimpses of the lives of each of the characters - captured her wit perhaps better than any scene in any other Austen film I can think of.    The acting is uniformly excellent, but there are performances, such as Embeth Davidtz as Mary Crawford and Harold Pinter as Fanny's uncle, that are truly Oscar-worthy.  And there are scenes, such as when Mary Crawford fully reveals her flexible morals and Fanny's judgment is vindicated, that I could watch over and over, they are so perfectly constructed. In short, I love this movie.

B001KVZ6F2|1.0|I hadn't heard a lot about 'Gran Torino' prior to renting it.  I do know that it received some critical acclaim and that neighbors who saw it liked it...but that's not surprising considering it's a Clint Eastwood Joint.  I love Clint, but everyone loved 'Mystic River' and 'Million Dollar Baby' (more like 'Million Dollar Boredom') and I thought those movies were boring as hell.<br /><br />Let me say before I swiftly bash this movie that Clint Eastwood is arguably the greatest of movie stars.  This guy has been in more classics and played some of the terrific characters to ever grace the silver screen.<br /><br />My guess is that this will be his last starring role and maybe that was what he intended when making it.  It doesn't really end the way most Eastwood films end in that he kills just about everyone in his path.  Maybe this is just a metaphor for a 'dying movie star', so to speak.  The way Harry Callahan or Philo Beddoe or Blondie would have handled these situations...well there would be some bodies left behind and/or a lot of people severely beaten left in his dust.  This isn't a bad thing, but the message I got from the ending was that Clint is showing us that he doesn't have to use his guns or fists as he rides off into the sunset as a motion picture actor.<br /><br />'Gran Torino' isn't really much of anything, really.  I can tell you that the script is appallingly bad and the acting by absolutely everyone involved is even worse.<br /><br />It's grumpy old man who hates everyone befriends neighbors he despises because he opens his heart up when they leave flowers and chicken dumplings on his doorstep.  Perhaps those relationships would be more entertaining and believable if ANYONE in that house next door could act a lick or was remotely likable.<br /><br />The first hour and twenty minutes are a complete and total bore and you will be asking whoever is unfortunate enough to suffer through it along with you, \\"What the hell is this movie about?\\"  At least something actually takes place in the last twenty minutes of the thing, but the closure is a major disappointment.<br /><br />I don't know if this is supposed to be about what Rocky Balboa told all of those Soviets in 'Rocky IV' about \\"If I can change and you can change, EVERYBODY can change\\" or what...but it was very, very bland, boring and horribly acted.  It would be a better story if he finally found good in some people upon opening his mind/heart and actually spoke to his children every once in awhile, but that whole scenario is just tossed under the door mat.<br /><br />I hate to think that this could be (and probably is) Clint's final starring role.

B00001ZT6Z|5.0|This album, featuring lead singer Tony Martin (the fifth lead singer, technically sixth, in Sabbath's history) is so underrated it's a sin.  Tony Martin himself is so underrated its a sin.  He's a great singer.  He's definitely the best singer the group has ever had.  To me, he sounds a lot like a toned-down Ronnie James Dio, but more versatile.  Martin was the lead singer of Black Sabbath for ten years, the same amount of time that Ozzy was.  Yet, hardly anybody knows about him.  An argument can be made that the Sabbath lineups from the late '80s through the '90s were basically Tony Iommi solo projects with the name Black Sabbath slapped onto the albums.  On the other hand, you should take these albums at face value.  They are Black Sabbath albums, just with different personnel.<br /><br />This album, along with the other Martin era albums, doesn't sound anything close to what the band's music sounded like when Ozzy Osbourne was the lead singer.  I don't mean that in a negative way.  What I mean is that the music just sounds completely DIFFERENT from previous Sabbath material, but it's still great stuff.  This album's music can be called \\"mystical metal\\" or \\"magical metal\\" or sort of like \\"fantasy metal.\\"  Great lyrics that are really on the dark side, maybe even darker than the Ozzy era.  The song Devil And Daughter is my favorite from this album, along with the title track and When Death Calls.<br /><br />Give Tony Martin his due and listen to this album and the others that came out during his era.  These albums might be a little hard to find due to the fact that the record label is little known IRS Records.  Highly recommended.

0307269981|5.0|In 'The Girl Who Played With Fire', Stieg Larsson's second volume in his 'Millenium Trilogy,  Lisbeth Salander goes off the grid for a year to relax and spend some hard-earned money.  As soon as she's back in Stockholm she is pursued and then becomes pursuer of various bad guys and good guys (some already known to her) wanting to take her down in one way or another.<br /><br />As a couple, Salander and Mikael Blomkvist are no longer an 'item'.  But grisly murders involve both--She is prime suspect with her prints on the murder weapon; he is witness and involved party to the investigation.  A Police Task Force is formed.  It thrashes within itself for clues and solutions, but only makes real progress when aided by Blomkvist and friends of Salander.<br /><br />As promised, Blomkvist keeps a safe distance from Salander.  But good for her he's able to keep close enough to pay back a favor owed from before.<br /><br />The teen prostitution/sex trade angle plays as distracting social statement in an otherwise first-rate suspense story.  After a hundred pages, interest in the teen sex trade victims fades as Salander herself becomes the embodiment of the oppressed and exploited.<br /><br />Larsson artfully employs an economical use of energy on characters. He doesn't waste time on deep characterizations of victims, bad guys, or transient players who do not advance the story line.  He saves his best for Salander, arguably one of the richest characters to emerge in recent literary history.  Whether a hacker-genius or  powerless autistic, she is relentless and always fearless.<br /><br />'The Girl Who Played With Fire' is a much more satisfying thriller than 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo'.  Less kinky but the suspense is drawn out artfully; every bit as engrossing as Larsen's Millenium  Installment #1.
0312356854|5.0|This part of history is fascinating to me and I found this book to be well written and hard to put down. My book club loved it.
0385340575|2.0|Having been VERY DISAPPOINTED with Nothing to Lose and having read the reviews of this book, I anxiously began my 6 hour read and looked forward to a great story.    Well, I cant say I got one.    This was boring, slightly predictable and the elements of what I have come to love about Jack Reacher were not there.    I give it 2 stars because the opening 3-4 chapters were quite good and unexpected. After that, I lost interest and I was expecting to not be able to put it down.     I think I read it so fast because I kept reading WAITING for it to get better so I didnt want to put it down because I hoped the storyline would improve.    I am not sure whats up with Mr. Child and his writing.. Maybe the character needs a break since this is 2 in a row that are pretty disappointing.     Want a good JR novel, START WITH The Enemy then read The Killing Floor and then skip to Without Fail.  I personally dont think Mr. Child will top The Enemy because its so rich in background- we learn about Reacher,  his family and why he is the man he is which is a great lead into Killing Floor.    Maybe #14 will be Mr. Child's lucky number.

B000JIHP88|5.0|This is probably to-date the best item that I have bought for my new baby. My daughter is 7 weeks old and she loves this mobile. She looks up at it and talks to the monkey who is staring down at her. That's a good feature in a mobile, that the toys with faces look down on the baby. This is something that prompted me to choose this mobile as opposed to the one that went with my baby's crib bedding. It's engaging but the leaves that sway up and down are also very lulling. The melodies are soothing and last a long time and if baby is still awake when the music stops, the mobile comes with a remote control so that you can turn it on again. This comes in handy at around 3am. I love this mobile and would recommend it to any new parent.  Update 03/2015 I just had my second child and I pulled this mobile out of storage. It still has the charm. My second baby loves it. The leaves got a bit bent out of shape but over time I was able to reshape them. Love, love, love this mobile.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|I grew when Michael Jackson was the king of the world. He was everywhere and could do no wrong but I was never really a huge fan. After watching this amazing performance however I can now see why he is and always will be `the king of pop' No one can top him when it comes to putting on an incredible show. His expertise and stage presence is simply mesmerising and I must give him props. Plus watching the audience absolutely freak out here is pretty entertaining too.<br /><br />This concert takes place in Bucharest Romania during the Dangerous Tour and at the height of his popularity in 1992. And except for the cheesy clothing and hairstyles (particularly on the back up dancers) you can barely tell that this concert is now almost 20 years old. The dance moves and music still feel fresh and exciting. MJ performs most of his mainstream hits for the better part of 2 hours in such a way that this show feels like a combination of stage musical and rock concert. Complete with outtakes of music videos including McCauley Culkin and Black Panther, glow in the dark skeletons and coffins (Thriller) and absolutely astounding dance routines (of course.) The audience is insane and almost as much fun to watch as the show itself; screaming, crying, passing out and being taken out by security. At one point Jackson attempts to enter the audience and I was actually scared for him thinking they're going to tear him apart. Its amazing stuff, one forgets just how popular he was back in the day.<br /><br />My only gripe would be the sound. Michaels vocals sometimes fade in and out, usually at the beginning of a song even though the back-up singers and crowd always sound fine. There's also a considerable amount of lip-synching although that may have something to do with the werewolf costume or all the musical theatre going on. Other than that as a `non-fan' I can highly recommend watching this concert as you will definitely come away with an appreciation for this performer whether you like him or not. I'm just sorry now that I never got to see him live.<br /><br />Songs included; Main Title, Jam, Wanna be Startin Something, Human Nature, Smooth Criminal, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, She's Out Of My Life, I Want You Back/The Love Save, I'll Be There, Black Or White, Heal The World, and Man In The Mirror.ust sorry now that I never got to see him live.

0553381687|2.0|Typical male-written fantasy. Strange sexual pairings, women as plot devices, and so generic it could have been a very long mad lib.<br /><br />I can't say I had high expectations, but I suppose they just weren't low enough to enjoy A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Points to Martin, however, for getting people to read and buy it.
0312360266|5.0|I really loved these books and I had a hard time putting them down.I can't wait for the next one to come out, I really enjoyed reading them. There was nights I would stay up until 2:00 Am reading and then having to work the next day. That's how good these books are to read. I have told some friends about them and I'm not the only one that loves them. To bad that doesn't happen in really life.
0060578793|5.0|The SAS survival book is probably the best survival book I have ever come across.  I highly recommend everyone getting a copy.    I know a few people who tend to be survival nuts and so I get regular talks on how a family of 4 can generally live nicely off rodents, pets, and local vegetation in a 2 mile radius of their home with nothing more than pocket lint and the clothes off your back.  I'm not that nuts...(and this comes from a guy who took his family camping... for 3 months. FYI- Wife and children loved it.)    I ended up getting this book for one of the guys I know, and stupid me, I started reading it.  Turned out to be probably the best book I have ever seen on the subject.  Very comprehensive.  No single book will tell you everything but this book tells you a lot of what you need to know to survive.  I recommend getting at least one copy for your survival bag.    There will always be more to know about how to live \\"wtshtf\\".  A lot depends on where you live.  The best way to know how to take care of yourself and your family is to get a copy of this book, read it through, and start trying it out where you live.
B0019LY5I2|3.0|This movie was bound to be action packed given that it's a G.I.Joe flick, but, wow!  Maybe I'm a sucker for action-packed movies,but this one really delivers. The favorite characters are there--Rip Cord, Snake Eyes, Duke, Scarlett, Cobra, etc., and the plot is actually believable, if a little over the top. And the graphics are  to die for. Some of the lines are a little plastic (unoriginal), but all in all, this one is worth the ticket.It also leaves plenty of wiggle room for a nice sequel.
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|Before I go off reviewing this anime masterpiece, I'll share my personal history with Ghost in the Shell, which dates back seven years ago.  Back in July of 2002, I had a bug to watch anime that came out of nowhere.  I went to the nearest Blockbuster and gazed at their meager selection of anime and the two VHS tapes that caught my attention the most were Akira (because I heard good buzz from friends) and Ghost in the Shell.  I noticed Ghost in the Shell because the tape box had a naked cyborg woman holding a gun and a \\"mature audiences only\\" sticker on it and my immature 14 year-old brain screamed \\"Violence and nudity?  Yeah!!  This is gonna be awesome!!\\"  I had to have my older brother come with me because I couldn't rent these tapes by myself due to my age at the time and a little bit after midnight on July 17 (when everyone was asleep), I popped this baby in my VCR and I was blown away.  Much to my surprise, this had A LOT more to offer than superficial violence and nudity and I was very pleased with that.  Along with Akira two nights prior, this completely changed my view on the complexity and maturity animation can achieve since I was rather uncultured concerning \\"adult animation\\" since all I watched until then was stuff like South Park and The Ren and Stimpy Show (I'm not saying they're bad, they're all good, just not nearly as sophisticated.).  Needless to say, I was so impressed by both anime titles, at around that time, it was those two that made me want to pursue a career relating to animation.<br /><br />PLOT<br /><br />The plot is that in the year 2029, computers and the internet have taken over everything and cybernetic humans are so complex and powerful, they easily pass off as the real thing.  There have been a spike in reports of cybernetic humans getting \\"ghost hacked\\" by an elite hacker known only as the \\"Puppet Master,\\" Public Security Section 9 are ready to get to the bottom of the whole Puppet Master dilemma.  Major Motoko Kusinagi is a powerful female cyborg and second in command of Section 9 and while investigating the Puppet Master case, she begins to doubt her own \\"human\\" authenticity due to her being a cyborg.<br /><br />COMPLEX, THOUGHT-PROVOKING THEMES<br /><br />This is why I love Ghost in the Shell so much, it's not the type of movie where you can just veg out and  still be able to comprehend the film, you actually have to pay attention to it.  Another thing about GITS that's great is that the focal point of the movie isn't about catching the Puppet Master, but rather about the Major's relationship between her body and her ghost.  One of the most moving scenes involving the Major's dilemma has to be where she's on the riverboat as she stares at various windows of department stores and office buildings as she stares at them, she begins to see herself as the manikins or office employees.  The Major is consumed by angst over the fact that she doesn't know her origins or even if her \\"ghost\\" is an authentic state of consciousness or a collection of artificial memories to feel like such.  I particularly enjoyed the scene were Batou and the Major are on the boat and after the Major goes scuba diving (which she needs flotation devices otherwise she'll sink like a rock) in which the Major says to Batou how that when she surfaces from a dive, she feel like she's becoming a different person.  I especially enjoyed her explaining to him the aspects of personal uniqueness:<br /><br />\\"There are countless ingredients that make up the human body and mind like all of the components that make up me as an individual with my own personality.  Sure, I have a face and voice to distinguish myself from others, but my thoughts and memories are unique only to me and I carry a sense of my own destiny.  Each of those things are just a small part of it, I collect information to use in my own way, all of that blends to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience.  I feel confined, only free to expand myselfwithin boundaries.\\"<br /><br />The Major is also disturbed by the fact that she can't evolve by any natural means since her cyborg body can't grow or change overtime, she's dying to embrace something new, so to speak.  After the cyborg suspected to have the \\"Puppet Master\\" itself inside it is snagged by Section 9, Motoko is dying to \\"ghost dive\\" into it and Batou dismisses the Major's inner struggle about herself and tells her to quit with the angst since she's treated like a normal human and the Major says one of the most memorable lines in the movie:<br /><br />\\"But that's the only thing that makes me feel human, the way I'm treated.\\"<br /><br />When the \\"Puppet Master\\" hacks into Section 9's security system and communicates with Chief Aramaki and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the \\"Puppet Master\\" says a lot of thought-provoking things, but to not spoil everything for you, here's what I think is one of the best:<br /><br />\\"A memory cannot be defined, but it defines mankind.\\"<br /><br />As far as the themes about the meaning of being human, the advances of computers, and with the fusion of man and machine, this is only the tip of the iceberg.  I'll let you watch the movie so you can absorb the other themes I didn't cover.<br /><br />ACTION SCENES<br /><br />While Ghost in the Shell isn't exactly an action anime, the action scenes it does have a rather inventive and cool.  For example, the scene towards the beginning where one of the Puppet Master's \\"ghost hacked\\" pawns tries to fight off the Major and her partners in Section 9, the pawn disguises himself with thermo-optic camouflage to make himself invisible and makes the shootouts more interesting.  The Major and Batou have to use infrared to find the invisible man and snag him.  The Major beats the guy at his own game by disguising herself with similar camouflage and hands his butt to the perpetrator in the process.  Needless to say, the scene towards the end where the Major battles a mecha-tank with only a machine gun is one of the most intense battle scenes I've ever seen in anime.<br /><br />ANIMATION, ARTWORK, AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS<br /><br />Ghost in the Shell is very revolutionary to be one of the first anime titles to incorporate computer graphics into traditional cel animation.  Best of all, the computer graphics are used to enhance the cel animation rather than use it as a crutch.  One of the best examples of this is right before the Major beats the snot out of a ghost-hacked criminal, there's a thermo-optic silhouette of her that zooms in on her head that looks so fantastic and despite that this was made in 1995, it could compete with computerized special effects in today's animated work.  The other special effects, particularly the simplified computer-generated images of the city and of the complex scans of cyborg brains are very, very impressive.  The animation itself is excellent, the characters and other animate objects move very fluidly as if they were real.  And as far as the smoothness of frame rates goes, it easily competes with Akira and the animated films from Studio Ghibli (in other words, as close to perfection as possible).  The artwork of the characters, vehicles, buildings, and everything else are all absolutely fantastic.  The characters have that \\"anime\\" aesthetic to them but at the same time, look much more \\"human\\" than the typical anime character.  The surroundings and high-tech stuff have TONS of detail attached to them.  You can clearly tell that these people didn't cut corners ANYWHERE.  I also love the colors used in Ghost in the Shell as everything seems to have a dark tint to create a feeling of uneasiness and even some fear in the depths of a futuristic Hong Kong.<br /><br />MATURE CONTENT<br /><br />This anime is recommended to viewers that are 17+ years old due to graphic violence and nudity.  I felt that both were used very tastefully as they were only used in scenes when necessary.  Also, contrary to what many of you are thinking about the Major's camouflage suit, she's NOT naked when she engages camouflage mode.  Her camouflage suit is merely the same color of her skin.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />The soundtrack for Ghost in the Shell is outstanding.  Kenji Kawai did an excellent job on his behalf as this really is a big part of the whole GITS experience.  The soundtrack consists mostly of minimalist, dark ambient electronic music intertwined with ethnic Japanese female choirs and even some ethnic percussion.  The soundtrack in general sends chills down my spine, particularly the scene where the Puppet Master is in Section 9's headquarters and is lecturing everyone about his origins.  The music track in that scene has a droning electronic passage accentuated by church bells to create the ultimate form of  \\"doom music.\\"  That music track by itself is unnerving, but when coupled with the dark visuals in that Puppet Master scene, will make anyone clench their whole bodies like a fist in fear.<br /><br />EXTRAS AND FEATURES<br /><br />Since I have the two-disk special edition of Ghost in the Shell, I'll delve into the special features of that edition of the movie.  Overall, I felt pretty pleased with the extras, particularly the Production Report and Digital Works featurettes.  The Production Report is in English and while it gives a somewhat simplified exploration into the production of GITS, it offers neat interviews with cast and production members and even of Masamune Shirow himself, who is depicted as a drawing for the interview since he doesn't like having his actual face shown in the media.  The Digital Works featurette was the best part.  It's in Japanese and give a much more in-depth exploration of how GITS was made.  Before watching the Digital Works segment, I thought the integration of CGI into cel animation wasn't that difficult but boy was I wrong!!  They needed a lot of different software to get GITS done, infact, the warehouse featured towards the end of the movie had to be constructed with CAD software to be done right.  There's even dossiers for the key characters in GITS, and while not really that big of a deal, are a nice addition to the DVD.  My only big gripe with the special edition is that there's no slide show of concept art, storyboards, vehicle designs, production artwork, or anything along those lines.  You'd think that something like Ghost in the Shell that's so involved with visuals would have something like this by default for the fans but sadly that's not the case.  There's also a bunch of trailers for other Manga titles and of promotional trailers for GITS.  There's a multitude of language tracks for this edition of GITS, but honestly, I'm pleased with only watching it in English and Japanese.  There's a dual-sided foldout poster with one side of the promotional image used for Ghost in the Shell while the other side features a nude Motoko floating against a computerized red backdrop with a bunch of wires and tubes attached to her body.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />In terms of anime, Ghost in the Shell is a superb feast for the eyes and the brain.  This anime will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the initial viewing with its intense action and nail-biting intrigue throughout the film and when it's all over, it'll leave you wondering about many, many things about humanity and technology.  I raise my ice-cold shotglass of Stolichnaya vodka to Mamoru Oshii for making such a timeless, excellent anime.  In a time where the words \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"art\\" are thrown around way too much by unseasoned, newer anime fans, Ghost in the Shell is one of the really few titles that truly deserves the title.  If the cyberpunk themes in Ghost in the Shell are your cup of tea, I suggest that you check out [[ASIN:B0009X7600 Armitage III: OVA]] and [[ASIN:B0002J4X3Y A.D.

B001W63DX2|3.0|The behind the scenes footage is priceless for any fan of metal!  Some of the moments are hilarious!  The concert footage is superb and crystal clear quality. If your a fan of them you couldn't ask for anything more than this.       My only complaint is  They did alot of songs I never heard before, and they didn't even do \\"Breaking the Law\\" which was one of their best tunes, I kept thinking well maybe their saving that one for the encore, but they never did it)  But it was still a great show that I would recommend to any metal fan.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I was not bothered by all the crazy fans.  It's fun to watch people's reaction in a live concert.  Someone mentioned about the lip-synched, I think it's not even a tiny problem to complain.  He was singing non stop for more than 2 hours and not mention all the dance routines,  and some of the songs have lead voice, back-up voice, and hee hee... which all normaly done by Michael himself, so he had to either lip synched or sung over a recorded track.  Any one who doesn't like it then try to scream and jump around for an hour (not even sing, just scream), if you are still alive then get in line and sue Michael's estate for lip synched (about 3 1/2 songs out of 18 songs) in live concert.  The only thing I found strange about the concert is there was no Dangerous song and it was a Dangerous tour.  But anyway I still love it and actually (accidently) bought it twice (this DVD and the one in a box set).  This DVD is proven that Michael Jackson is the best entertainer that ever lived.
B001H5X7I4|2.0|Okay, I get it:  TROPIC THUNDER is a parody of all the action/adventure movies; heck, it's a parody of Hollywood (and its greed) itself.  What's really disappointing is the movie hooks the viewer right away with some hilarious theatrical \\"trailers\\" featuring the three main protagonists (Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr.).  And then we're treated to an over-the-top intro of a Vietnam War epic in the making that is a total travesty.  The stars are dysfunctional, the movie is over budget, and the Viet vet novelist who penned the story (Nick Nolte) is nuts.  Hey, I'm on board, I'm laughing, I'm ready to enjoy some serious satire.<br /><br />But once Nolte's character convinces the eccentric director (Steve Coogan) to actually maroon the cast in the jungles of Vietnam (with cameras and rigged explosives placed sporadically in the trees to capture the actors' reactions), and when the ensemble is actually confronted by a gang of drug lords, TROPIC THUNDER dissolves into petty goofiness.  The film meanders and the plot becomes just plain silly, Stiller is woefully nonsensical, and Black's talents are utterly wasted.  I did enjoy Downey's portrayal of an Australian character actor so intent to his craft he actually had his skin pigment darkened to \\"become\\" the African American character he was playing, and for once Jay Baruchel wasn't overly annoying.  But that aside, TROPIC THUNDER had such potential, and then squandered it; not even a supporting cast including Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise can salvage this gobbler.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

0894803123|3.0|I bought this book with the hopes of learning something about ice cream and making flavors as close as possible to my fav ben and jerry varieties.  Sadly, I learned very little from the book that I couldn't have gotten from the manual that came w my kitchen aid attachment.  For my base cream I do not use the recipes from this book as i am not a fan of the raw egg technique - I make a basic creme anglais and flavor it which has worked perfectly for us.  An example of my disappointment would be in the cherry garcia recipe.  Obviously they are not going to give exact recipes, but tricks and tips would be helpful especially when working with fruit.  When you use straight up fruit the water content freezes and you have fruit cubes when you eat the ice cream.  I swear by Americas Test Kitchen and when I made their strawberry ice cream (which was amazing) I used a little vodka in the strawberry mixture and they were the perfect consistency - but there has to be an alcohol free way.  All in all this is a cutesy book that's fun to have in a collection - but definitely not an ice cream bible especially for somewhat experienced cooks.
B000IHSKUM|5.0|These shoes are made with incredible quality.  Even after 3.5 years, the only thing worn out on these shoes was the soles, which had been worn down due to miles of walking.  The stitching and leather were still intact and my husband still plans to use his first pair for yard work.  The toe guards are great for minimizing gravel and wood chips getting stuck under your foot and the cord is great for easy on/off from your foot.  We highly recommend this shoe for hiking and outdoor use.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) presides over a family funeral as the one in charge of the decedent family member's funeral. He is also the straight man for all of these goofy characters who attend it.  Those who attend the funeral are a madcap bunch who promise mirth and mayhem at every turn and usually deliver.  I did not find this rolling on the floor funny as so many did but I enjoyed it.  I thought it was a good night's entertainment on DVD.  As you might expect at a family based funeral, all the typical family repressed hostilities come to the fore.  Every grievance from the past, concern over property and pecking order within the family eventually works itself to the surface to be dealt with farcically anew.  It's taken me a long time to enjoy British comedy.  I now do enjoy it quite  regularly.  However, it may indeed help to be a Brit for this to make it all the way to five stars for a viewer.  For me it was four stars.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B001UW58WW|5.0|I love this CD. I had heard an interview with David Garrett and some of the songs on NPR and decided to try to find it. I thoroughly enjoy it and will purchase more of his CDs in the future.
B0018YIFEK|3.0|I've been a Jodi Picoult reader from the beginning.  I can usually count on a good read about an interesting topic, and this novel doesn't disappoint in that aspect.  That being said, I have never been so angry about a novel's conclusion.  In fact, it made me so hopping mad I threw the paperback on the floor!  I don't need \\"and they all lived happily ever after\\"  but I detested the choices Picoult made in the last 14 pages of this otherwise gripping novel.
B001SGEUNI|2.0|Its what I expected.  A full album with 2 really good songs.  I listened to the CD a couple of times...now I'm done.
0316044695|5.0|If you want to read the most action packed real life military action book you can imagine buy this today. Another reviewer said it best, the first 40 pages or so seem very matter of fact about Seal training. Marcus seems over the top patriotic but determined to be a Seal. I thought that was going to be the focus of the book with a battle thown in.      Then hold on man, after I read the rest of the book I am over the top patriotic and think the Navy Seals are everything good I ever heard about them. This is the story that really tells it like it is.    When I was a kid I used to get adventure military paperbacks. The soldiers fired maching guns from the hip, got blown up and kept fighting, then fought off hoardes of enemy in impossible odds. This true story has all that and a wonderful spirituality and patriotism that is pure and heroic.    This will be a military classic in years to come.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I just received my box set today, it is well worth the wait.  The sound quality of the cds and the visual of the dvd is absolutely outstanding. I would highly recommend it is a true collectors item.  Enjoy.......
B0028K3192|2.0|This is not even in the same galaxy as \\"Now.\\" I am disappointed with this new album, because it lacks a true heart at the center of the music. Yes, the production is cutting edge for the moment, but in ten years, or even five years, this will be considered one of Maxwell's weakest efforts, because the songs themselves are his least memorable. I can't hum ONE single track from this album, after many listens over several weeks now, and I was able to sing several tracks from \\"Now\\" within a day or two of hearing them, because those songs really grab you and stay in your mind. Examples: \\"Cold\\" and \\"Help Somebody\\" are buried under several layers of complex beats and fancy horn riffs. I spent more time trying to lock into the grooves, until I finally realized that the songs themselves were average at best, sounding like Lenny Kravitz repeating himself on a dull day. \\"Stop the World\\" and even the highly rated \\"Pretty Wings\\" sound like Prince on an average day. Overall, I get the feeling that this album is all about the surface production, not the writing, and that is very sad, because Maxwell's previous album, \\"Now,\\" is one of the most well-written and compellingly soulful albums in modern music. The \\"Now\\" album is the opposite of this new effort: \\"Now\\" is a stripped-down album where the production is very simple and stays out of the way, showcasing a very powerful batch of songs that still stand among his strongest. \\"Now\\" is pure Maxwell, a record that no one else could have made but him alone. This new album basically sounds like a half-hearted Prince and Lenny Kravitz imitation. I don't hear the real Maxwell in this music.    Bottom line: \\"Now\\" remains a masterpiece, and still sounds timeless and soulful today. Play that album again, and you will again be completely mesmerized by its soul and beauty. The songs still touch the heart. After eight years, I'm still waiting for the real Maxwell to reappear. This new album sounds slick on the surface, but lacks the real substance. It is hollow at the core. A year or two from now, people will forget this record. And for an artist like Maxwell who wrote songs like \\"Lifetime\\" or \\"Symptom Unknown\\" or \\"For Lovers Only,\\" it is truly a shame to say that.
B0026RHR6K|1.0|THIS REVIEW PERTAINS TO THE DVD RELEASE ONLY -     The show, as covered quite extensively, is a phenomenal drama that truly touches on humanity's reaction to virtual extermination in a sci-fi setting.  I highly recommend the TV show.    However, the packaging for this release is abyssmal at best.  Everything that you have already read, from the stacked configuration of the discs that make them difficult to remove to the fact that the discs are free to slide around at will are true.  I ordered one set from Amazon and, to Amazon's credit, it was protected well in its shipping container.  However, the discs were free to slide within Universal's poorly packaged product resulting in several, BADLY scratched discs.    Amazon was happy to oblige with a replacement.  Once again, Amazon did a superb job in ensuring that the product was well protected.  Once again, however, Universal's poor packaging resulted in several scratched discs and one of the cardboard containers had somehow managed to get squashed despite the pristine condition of the box that it arrived in.    Fed up, I asked for a refund and Amazon did not disappoint.  I decided just to get the individual seasons and the extra $20 I paid was well worth getting the entire show in flawless condition.  I highly recommend spending the extra money to buy the individual seasons because this particular packaging, as cool as the concept was, was not remotely practical.  Any DVD packaging that requires the owner to SLIDE their discs out of glossy cardboarding should be rejected immediately.  There are far better ways to package something like this and this CUBE is not one of them.  Shame on Universal for trying to cash in on a superb show with the cheapest, most frustrating packaging ever.  I know that I'm not alone on this given the other packaging complaints that I've seen.

B00005K3NR|4.0|i was very happy with my purchase. i received this item very fast and no problems. i am very satisfied.
1400032717|4.0|This was a very fast read and I really enjoyed it. This is a story about a 15 year old autistic boy who finds his neighbors dog dead in the middle of this night. He takes it upon himself to solve the mystery of who killed the dog and ends up solving a much bigger unanticipated mystery in addition. This is a heart warming story of the challenges austic people face and a rare insight into their world and way of thinking. What may seem totally irrational to the naked eye is likely in fact very logical to them. The language is so basic and thoroughly explained that in the beginning I thought I should be reading this with my 10 year old daughter. There are many complicated things that are explained so clearly and thoroughly, that I thought it might be a good book for her. However, as the story progressed, some of the topics got a lot more mature and I began to rethink that idea - maybe in a few years. There were many parts where I found myself chuckling at the way he looks at things. Most adults are so adept at putting spin on things, and so concerned about being politically correct and/or funny, that they don't even think about the things they say. To have someone take the ordinary things we say and make you look at them differently was a very charming side-effect of this story. I recommend this book for anyone over 15 simply for the fact that it's a quick and easy read that will have the wonderful affect of helping you see into the often hard to understand world of an autistic person and possibly be a little more compassionate when you interact with one.
B001KVZ6G6|1.0|Up is another one of Pixar's excellent digital films. The story was delightful and as always well written but for a single disc blu-ray movie $41.99 is extremely overpriced and down right pretentious. Good luck getting me to pay that price for this or any other single disc movie for that matter.
0385341008|5.0|This is a great book! The entire story is told through letters written back and forth among various people. I wasn't expecting that, so it took me a little while to get used to the style, but it didn't take long at all to get into the story.<br /><br />The story is about a writer who is looking for the next subject of her book. While she is working on this, she receives a letter from a man who has a copy of a book she once gave away (Selected Essays of Charles Lamb) that still has her name and address inside the cover. He writes her because he really liked the book and is wondering if she might know if how he can get a hold of more of his writings. He can't find them himself because WWII has just ended and he is on an island in the English Channel. He reveals in his letter that he found this book through his book club The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society which spurs a conversation between the two regarding the strange name of the book club and how the club came into being in the first place. Over the course of the story we get to know various members of the club and how the war affected them all.<br /><br />I love how this story told itself through letters. This is a wonderfully written book with a beautiful story and a unique way of telling it. I will definitely recommend this to others and will probably read it again myself someday.
B0000714B5|5.0|I am a long time seeker of Truth and Siddartha delivers an excellent example of Life's ultimate quest culminating in profound understanding. Those who gave this movie 1-4 stars, simply aren't ready to understand what this movie contains.  It hits the bulls-eye on every level and is quite capable of introducing the viewer to the deepest and most profound Truths of life. It is not the movies fault if the viewer is incapable of appreciating those Truths. For those who have the maturity in knowing the basic underlying realities of life and the deeper laws which guide it, this movie will not disappoint. I suggest that you watch this movie at least once a year and if you are growing mentally, emotionally  and spiritually, you will see that this movie reveals more and more to you over the years...such is it's depth and deliverance of eternal Truth. I collect DVDs that give inspiration, insight, courage, humor and appreciation of life and this movie ranks at the top of that collection. Some of those movies are: \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\", \\"Milarepa\\", \\"Never Cry Wolf\\", \\"Outsourced\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\" Pale Rider\\",\\" Flywheel\\", \\"Fireproof\\", \\"Facing The Giants\\", \\"Treasure of the Sierra Madrea\\",\\" Whale Rider\\",\\"Ghost Busters\\", \\"Modern Times\\", \\"The Great Dictator\\", \\"Amer. Graffiti\\",\\"The Gold Rush\\",\\"Far And Away\\", \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", \\"Hamlet\\", \\"Man of La Mancha\\", and many others. I highly recommend Siddartha even if it takes awhile for one to fully appreciate it's depth, I tell you, it's really everything you need to know about life - the rest is simply realizing it by practicing the understandings/truths/wisdom, offered.
0446615641|4.0|A most interesting piece of fiction that every reader will enjoy. The work contains different suprises at every turn of the page. I would strongly suggest the reader get a copy of the \\"Camel Club\\" first by the same author before reading this work. The characters are vivid, the action exciting, and the ending somewhat unexpected.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I purchased this DVD from Amazon.com several months ago. I should really preface the following review with my stats:    Age: 24 (23 when I began this routine)  Height: 5'5''  Weight: 110 lbs  Work-out level: Advanced     I had read several reviews that said this workout was a killer for knees, but I discredited them because of my excellent condition and the rave reviews that outweighed them. I LOVED this workout for about a month, and then I noticed that I had extreme knee issues after using it. I stopped and cut back to determine whether or not this DVD was the cause, sure enough, I always experienced severe pain after the routine... even after replacing this workout for an entire month, the next time I used it my knee started giving out again. I wasn't idle during the time I wasn't using this DVD (I have several others, including the shape ultimate bikini body workout, which is excellent), so I'm sure that it was only this DVD which caused the issues. If you even THINK it's possible that your knees could be damaged, go elsewhere. It just isn't worth it when there are so many other effective products to choose from.    Also, as with most DVDs, the workout is about 27 minutes, not 20.     Good luck!
0446615625|4.0|A most interesting piece of work. The author has created a real page turner that will keep you spellbound right to the very last page. The story is well laid out and gives the reader the opportunity to pick a personal hero as the story unfolds. This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a well written creative fictional work that has a splash of mystery woven into it as well.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|This movie was a showcase for Steve McQueen's talents and flair for fashion and fast living: gliding, polo playing, dune buggy racing along a deserted beach (except for unseeen camera and film crew), some activities cherished by the rich and famous.  While it is dated in the dress styles (Faye in her Chanel and Courrege-inspired boots and outfits), and 60's vehicles, it is still a cinematic foray into photographic procedure, subtley exciting drama with a twist of humor, mouthwatering sensual interchanges between two screen icons, and an opportunity for McQueen memorabilia chasers.  If you liked Steve, (who didn't admire his style, grace, and charmed life), this is one film your collection shouldn't be without, just because it is the quinessential Steve McQueen -- action hero, winner in the end, ultimate scoundrel, and yet so thoroughly likeable.

1400064287|4.0|An American conglomerate with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue may hire a big shot Manhattan firm to handle marketing ideas. But for the local baker looking to increase his presence, the businessman trying to give a sales presentation or just the mother trying to instill morals in her child, there is Made to Stick, a hand-holding primer on effective messaging. Written by trendy west-coast consultant-brothers Chip and Dan Heath, the book offers us no cutting edge consumer psychology or advanced literature on human memory recall. In fact examples are doled out in highly entertaining bits of anecdotes and stories, void of the numerology typical of modern marketing professionals. The advice is simplistic and save for a few gems, unsurprising. No doubt, the Manhattan firm would provide more effective ideas than anything that can be gleaned from the book's cookie-cutter procedures. Nevertheless, Made to Stick delivers on its central promise, both implied and explicit - it's easy for the businessman and even applicable to the parent.    The book couldn't be more simplistic and un-academic. Most of you think the previous sentence has a negative intonation. Made to Stick's ease of usefulness may have you reconsider. The common person with common problems has never been aided by today's obtuse academic musings on originally simplistic and common fields such as accounting or leadership. Effective messaging is another of those fields. The Heath brothers keep you at bay from today's theoretical categorization of market types, conceptualization of ideas from other sciences, or advanced computerization and model building. Instead, they offer only one acronym- SUCCESs- whose letters represent only six common attributes of an effective (\\"sticky\\") message. It's self-validating in fact, since simplicity is the first of those attributes. To be simple, the authors recommend finding a singular essence and explaining it in terms and images already familiar to everyone. To be unexpected, the reader has to break a pattern and leave out a smidge of information to promote curiosity. To be concrete, we have to bring people in with representations they can easily picture. And likewise, the brothers explain, we can be credible and emotional. The ease of explanation is taken to another level as the authors invent lucid ways of assessing an attribute, for example their so-called Sinatra Test, named for the famous musician's line on New York: \\"If you can make it here you can make it anywhere.\\"     That said, it's easy to lay out attributes matter-of-factly and get lost in methodology, reverting to the sins of academia. To apply methodology is the ultimate matter at hand. Luckily, this is the facet where Made to Stick shines brightest. The book is chockfull of intriguing real life examples in a style reminiscent of chicken-soup-for-the-soul. For example, the section on emotionality tells us the ways others have stretched associations of honorable words and appealed to self-pride or personal identity. Often times the anecdotes not only illustrate applications, but are either inspirational, such as scientists inflicting danger upon themselves to prove their point in an uphill battle for credibility, or fascinating, such as the eccentric employee training methods of an upscale clothier demonstrating unexpectedness. Ultimately, the applications range from billion dollar airliners to a single suburban math teacher attempting to explain the importance of Algebra. But to take it to the final step, to champion complete translucency, the authors shove their applications into a Petri dish and assess different renditions of the same example for the six attributes. The so-called \\"clinics\\" are in every section and by this, with a copy of Made to Stick, even the most unsophisticated beginner is set for effective messaging.
B000005H63|3.0|3 1/2    Jazz piano's tiniest terror struck effectively several times before an untimely death, here putting in a fine display of uptempo stimulus and Evan's-esque balladry, if not tearing down the studio walls with originality.
0452295548|5.0|I haven't yet read this book, but it is on the top of my list. I have only seen a video excerpt of the book on Amazon and I started to cry.     Also being a woman in my 30's and had suffered a stroke 2yrs ago (I'm now 100% as of last year) I have to say that for anyone who has had a stroke or know of anyone who has suffered, the Author, Dr. Taylor described this beautifully and eloquently well. She described it to the tee of how it felt! I honestly thought I was the only one who had this happen to me, I had just given birth to a beautiful healthy baby girl and then the stroke happened. I felt it all over again just hearing her speak.     What's also very powerful & interesting is the fact that I could feel the stroke happening to me twice in one day. My recovery time was not long at all due to the fact that I'm a Fitness Instructor. I did lose the right side of my body, right leg and right arm, thankfully my speech wasn't lost, only for 2mins each time this happened to me. I know this book teaches us to use our brain, we all do whether we know it or not, it's just whether you choose to! But it also teaches us how are brain heals itself. For anyone who might be around when someone happens to go through this, it's a devastating thing in their lives at that moment, be patient, they may not be able to speak, it's all slurred, you need to act fast. I'm reminded everyday how valuable life is just by looking at my daughter. I'm happy to say that I had someone here when this happened to me and it saved me. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. I can't wait to read it. Kudos to the Author well done.
1433503794|4.0|Since the quality and scholarly nature of both the English Standard Version itself and the Study Bible in particular have been addressed at great length and more thoroughly than I myself could, this review will address primarily the physical product received.  I really think this product deserves 4.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't offer that option.  As a caveat to this review, you should know that this is the first imitation leather-bound Bible I have owned (though I have briefly experienced others from time to time), that I am 23 years old and my vision is corrected to 20/20 with contact lenses.<br /><br />MY ONE COMMENT ON THE TEXT: Depending on one's view of the subject of origins, on might find issue with laxity and freedom with which the accounts of the events of Genesis 1-11 are treated in the notes.  In the Introduction to Genesis and the notes it is directly stated several times and implied more often that those who hold to such views as the day-age theory, the analogical days theory, the literary framework theory and the gap theory are as faithful to the text as those who hold to literal interpretation of the creation account (those who believe in a literal, six-day, young-earth creation).  Similarly, they suggest that one cannot rightly conclude from the Genesis account that flood of Noah's day covered the whole earth or that it can explain the geological formations (\\"the strata, the fossils, the deformation, and so on.\\") observed today.  These remarks seem to contradict an assertion earlier in the article that the framework/literary style of the book clear shows that it was intended to describe and report actual, historical events.<br /><br />THE BOOK:<br /><br />Cover - (5/5).  The cover is soft and pliable, is fairly smooth and feels very heavy-duty (durable).  The connection to the binding has sturdy feel to it, but is flexible enough to make the Bible very easy to keep open both in the lap and on a table or other hard surface.<br /><br />Binding - (5/5).  When I first opened it, the binding felt a bit stiff (as in, difficult to open or keep open).  However, upon leaving open for about an hour, and several times opening and closing, it is now quite comfortable.  It does tend to \\"pull closed\\" somewhat in the first few or the last few pages, but a very light touch is sufficient to keep this in check.  As another reviewer mentioned the pages do seem to have some awkward, transverse wrinkles in the \\"gutter\\" right next to the binding (that is, the \\"ripple\\" pattern of the wrinkles goes from the bottom of the page to the top, but it's sideways span out of the center of the spread is very small).  However, as this did not affect my use of the Bible, I didn't take anything off its rating.<br /><br />Pages - (4/5).  The pages are somewhat sticky on the edges, making it at times difficult to turn the page.  This, however, I suspect will diminish with use.  The Bible lost a point in the pages rating because of text blurring.  As mentioned by another reviewer, there is a section in the Bible (pages 129-192 in my Bible, or about Gen. 46-Ex. 29) where the text appears to have a shadow offset from it causing a blurred appearance.  I chose not to attempt to exchange because the text is still quite readable to me, and it is a fairly small section of the Bible.  However, it may cause more trouble for others (like my mom, who said it was irritating and distracted her from what she was reading).<br /><br />SUMMERY: I heartily recommend this product.  It has a sturdier, more elegant feel than the hardback, and will probably last longer.  So if you can deal with some laxity of interpretation in the notes and are willing to deal with some blurred text or are willing/able to do exchanges until you get one without it, I think you will be pleased and satisfied with the result.  If you have specific questions, I will try to reply to them here (I am a student, so my time is limited).  I will also attempt to upload pictures of the blurred text and wrinkles as customer images on Amazon.d wrinkles as customer images on Amazon.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I wanted to get a better set of headphones for my ipod. I Started with Bose and though they sounded nice the reviews said they break easily. I tried a pair at Target. Then went and checked out the Senheiser. I didn't want an extra long jack, having to use the adaptor to take the jack from standard to ipod size. So I checked out the Sony 7506 set. I checked the majority of the reviews were all favorable. So I placed the order. I received them in about three days. Good Job Amazon. As far as the headphones go. At first they seemed a little warm, but that soon passed. I was really inpressed with the sound quality. The highs and the base are clear and crisp. You can distinguish the different instruments playing. I listen to a lot of New Age and World Music. These phones are made well and are comfortable to wear. They do cancel out a lot of outside noine. I'm looking forward to many years of enjoyment.I'm very happy with my purchase.

B0019LY5I2|4.0|Very similar to Transformers 2, GI Joe is an action packed movie almost from beginning to end. Great special effects, fight scenes, and great action. Just like Transformers 2 the story was a little weak. The script seemed to be poorly written as well as very average at best acting. GI Joe was impressive to me because unlike Transformers 2 it had very few if any vulgar words in the movie. So in that aspect it makes it ok for smaller children that like GI Joe to go see and enjoy the movie. All in all the movie wasn't perfect but the sequels to come only leave room for the future movies to get better.
006091307X|5.0|... did Pynchon deliberately leave out the line, or more precisely, the line segment that connects the circle with the triangle?  Taken together, the three geometric elements (or is it four, to lapse into a Pynchonian mindset, or is that progress into...) form a muted horn, and is the symbol for Tristero, the alternate mail system that has been in competition, for centuries, with the establishment systems of Thurn and Taxis, of the Holy Roman Empire, through Wells Fargo, and the U. S. Postal system.<br /><br />This is Thomas Pynchon's second novel, written in 1966. It is a thin work, perhaps a \\"pot-boiler\\" to keep him going, written between his first, and my favorite work, \\"V,\\" in 1963, and his magnum opus, \\"Gravity's Rainbow,\\" written in 1973. I've read them all, each not that long after publication, and decided it is time to re-visit them. Not even 150 pages, it is immensely rich, in the Pynchon style, combining obscure historical events, unlikely chance happenings, fragments of scientific history/theories, sexual romps, puns and song lyrics, always the more than a hint of \\"the orbiting ecstasy of true paranoia,\\" the fear of the other, the teasing of conspiracy theories, and a character in quest of the truth(s). It is his most \\"accessible work,\\" and therefore recommended to the first-time Pynchon reader.<br /><br />The central character is Oedipa Maas, who had once been a mistress of the immensely rich Pierce Inverarity, and now has been named as executor of his estate. In the process, she repeatedly encounters signs and clues to the Tristero Empire. But is it all an elaborate hoax, she wonders, towards the end of the book? Pynchon is brilliant, and weaves actual historical events, and his complete fabrications, seamlessly. Where does the reality end, and the fantasy begin?  For example, he includes the real events of submarines trying to circumvent the steel curtain dropped in the Dardanelles during World War I with the fictional account of a fight between Confederate boats and the Russian navy during the American Civil War, which gave rise to the Peter Pinguid Society, a spoof on the John Birch Society. He weaves \\"Maxwell's Demon\\" into his novel, like perhaps no one else has; the hypothetical intellectual construction of James Clerk Maxwell, the physicist who formulated the laws of Thermodynamics. Caprice and whimsy are a constant in a Pynchon novel, a Plank's constant if you will, consider: \\"If miracles were....intrusions into this world from another, a kiss of cosmic pool balls...\\"  Later he draws parallels between the DT's of an alcoholic, and the dt's of calculus. He postulates that the entire French revolution may have been caused by the Tristero, so that it could issue the Proclamation of the 9th Frimaire, An III, ratifying the end of the Thurn and Taxis postal monopoly in France and the Lowlands.<br /><br />Amidst such caprice, he embeds some wonderful zingers. Concerning a possible postal misprint from the US government, Maas's lawyer, Metzger says: \\"So they make misprints...let them. As long as they're careful about not pressing the wrong button, you know?\\" Or on the true need for the Tristero: \\"...onto a network by which X number of Americans are truly communicating whilst reserving their lies, recitations of routine, arid betrayals of spiritual poverty, for the official government delivery system...\\"<br />The second time around, and the years of accumulated knowledge, plus Google, make Pynchon even more enjoyable, though the speculation of how much you \\"get\\" the author is still probably no higher than an 80%.

B000OVLBFS|5.0|A keen sense of drama, humor, timing and courage- all wrapped up in an aging Selleck. The mix of booze, despair, and the fight for his brand of honor is done to perfection.  Parker's writing is genius and so is the script for this movie.  Every actor is worth watching...but, Selleck is riveting in his complexity. As Jesse Stone, his flaws captivate.  One more trouncing of the bad guys-Jesse style-makes our hearts glad.

1402568851|5.0|Christopher, who has autism is the narrator of this fictionalized book. The book begins with a neighbor's dog, named Wellington, being killed. Christopher decides to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington.<br /><br />I listened to the audiotape of the book because it was a selection for our book club and all print copies were out of the library. It seemed like such a weird title and premise for a book that I did not want to waste the money if it was not good.<br /><br />The narrator for this audiobook, Jeff Woodman, was awesome. You really felt like the author (as Christopher) was telling the story. I really think hearing the story vs reading the story was beneficial in many ways. When he starts talking about colors and how they affect whether it will be a good or bad day; when he describes his rationale and views on life, school, honesty; all these things have a powerful impact when you hear \\"Christopher\\" talk about them. You realize he is a genius in \\"maths\\", trapped in a mind that is restricted in some ways and totally, perfectly clear in others. Listening to Christopher speak, you have a better understanding of his logic. The revelations he discovers when he is trying to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington also bring about chaos, distrust and disorder in his well=structured life.<br /><br />His view of the world, his honesty and naivete' all come out in the voice of the story. Mr. Woodman's voice was perfect and Christopher was magically transformed for me. I definitely finished this audiobook with a different perspective about those with high functioning autism/Asperger's affects the individual, the family and those around them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for bringing an enlightening view to a topic that is rarely discussed.
B000WQKSJ0|5.0|I don't understand what the deal is with trying to 'fix' things that don't need any fixing. The First Edition of 'The Killing Joke' has far better coloring than the Deluxe Edition released last year. I'm glad I could find it at a decent price in Amazon because I'm sure in the years to come, its price will go up (not that I would want to sell it). Alan Moore is a genius, the story is excellent and clearly they used many of the ideas in this comic in the \\"Dark Knight\\" film. The only complain I could possibly have is that it is too short.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead<br />OK Computer; 1997<br />Capitol Records<br /><br />My Rating: 96/100<br /><br />All things considered, THE BENDS was essentially an outstanding mope-rock record. I've already expressed my deep appreciation for what the band did there, but looking back, it was OK COMPUTER that made me (and many other music geeks) believers. When it all comes down to it, there are records that better describe what it was like to be alive in the late-1990's, but none that speak so profoundly as OK COMPUTER. With acts left and right embracing their inner electronic selves, OKC was the album that injected it all with a healthy dose of skepticism and irony. Note well: OKC is also the lone CLASSIC record from that era and genre. Still, it's not that OK COMPUTER is preachy at all. On the contrary, Yorke and company masterfully paint twelve pictures of what it means to be living in a time such as this. When Yorke howls \\"Pull me out of the air crash/Pull me out of the wreck/Cuz I'm your superhero\\" he seems to foreshadow our present turmoil, sprung upon the world just four years later. Maybe that's because, while their Brit-rock counterparts were busy boozing it up and swapping headlines in the tabloids, this was a band with an eye the world around them. Overall, OK COMPUTER is a harrowing listen and experience, from the opening riffs of \\"Airbag\\" to the extraterrestrialisms of \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien,\\" right on through nine tracks that, though diverse in style, are thematically linked. Though it is forever anchored in the late 90's, in light of Yorke's closing plea to \\"slow down,\\" OK COMPUTER becomes a truly timeless record. Go on - sit back and shudder.<br /><br />TRACKS:<br /><br />1. Airbag (5/5)<br />2. Paranoid Android (5/5)<br />3. Subterranean Homesick Alien (5/5)<br />4. Exit Music (for a Film) (5/5)<br />5.

B000AWYOGE|4.0|Dark Water, the first English language movie directed by Brazilian Walter Salles (Central Station, Motorcycle Diaries) is a very good movie. This is the type of intelligent non-slasher horror films that I enjoy. Its power is not in showing gore and roaring monsters but in the creating the atmosphere of unbearable tension and in making the very familiar everyday things and situations ominous, gloomy, and ready to hurt. Dark Water is also about very real and sympathetic characters, a young single mother and her little girl, and the bond and love between them. It is about real monsters of abuse, negligence, and criminal indifference that could and would affect a child's future life and lead to the tragic event at some point. I did not see the original Japanese movie of which Dark Water is a remake but I found this remake set in the creepiest apartment building on the Roosevelt Island, NY imaginable, a very underrated, good on its own merits and certainly worth watching drama/psychological thriller with the elements of supernatural thriller. Acting is first class. Jennifer Connelly in a truly heartbreaking performance as a recently divorced woman trying to move on together with her little daughter deserves a special mention and respect. John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, Pete Postlethwait, and Dougray Scott all made their characters interesting and memorable. It was nice to see Camryn Manheim in a small cameo. Two young girls also were very good. The camera work by Alfonso Beato, who more recently shot the award winning films \\"All About My Mother\\" (1999) \\"Ghost World\\" (2001), \\"The Queen\\" (2006), and \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" is amazing. The apartment where Dahlia and Cecil moved, had a strong and scary personality, and could be consider another very important film's character. If I add that the original music to the film was written by Angelo Badalamenti, the usual David Lynch's collaborator, you'd have a good idea of the surreal dark atmosphere of the film. I recommend it but do not expect a pure horror flick. Dark Water is deeper than that.<br /><br />3.5-4.0 of 5ut do not expect a pure horror flick. Dark Water is deeper than that.    3.5-4.0 of 5

B000YABIQ6|5.0|I recently watched clips of Mad Men on Hulu.  I found it very interesting and when Amazon had a sale, I bought Season 1.  I have now just finished a marathon session of watching Season 1, and this show blew me away!!  I only intended to watch a couple of episodes, but got so caught up in it, that I spent the entire day watching all 13 episodes.  I don't know how true the show is to Madison Avenue, but there is no political correctness here--the attitudes expressed on the show, while totally unacceptable today, all feel true and believable for the setting and time period.  It was shocking to see a pregnant woman drinking and smoking (because they did that then) and other things shown on the show.  I'm glad that most of those things are not done today, but know that people did act that way then.  The direction, sets, crisp dialogue, and depth of talent of the ensemble cast, most of whom I was unfamiliar with, are all incredible.  The only casting quibble I had was with the actor who portrayed the much younger \\"little\\" brother of Don Draper, who just looked and felt wrong to me.  He looked as old or older than Don.  The other supporting cast members, were great.      My favorites are gorgeous Jon Hamm of course, along with January Jones, and Elizabeth Moss.  This is truly a great show.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|The ground breaking graphic novel now makes its way to the big screen.  And it's clear only the big screen can cope with this project...  It's certainly a surprisingly bold and original mixture of adult themed drama and superhero milieu to come from a modern day risk-averse Hollywood - but does it work?<br />Creating a complex alternate timeline set in the mid 80's, where superheroes exist and Nixon is still in power having won Vietnam, we are presented with a world where the cold war is leading inexorably to doomsday and the American dream has soured.  The Minutemen, a group of vigilantes originally formed in the 40's, who donned costumes and kept superfit to deal with crime, have been disbanded as their methods are called into question.  Now one of their number, the Comedian, has been slain, and gradually the remaining Minutemen must start talking together and rediscover old alliances to save the world as it teeters on the edge of extermination.  Of course, that's only the barest bones of what is going on.  What actually IS going on and what it all means will doubtless be the topic of many fevered post movie discussions.. whether you love it or loathe it, you'll almost certainly be talking about it - and is that not what the best directors really want?<br />The movie is full of conflicted characters with authentically grimy backstories and motivations... in juxtaposition with the graphic novel stylisations and God-complexes.  For the most part the costumed heroes are only too human - not just noble heroic human, but flawed with an ugly side human.  Did Batman appeal for having a hero who had no superpower, and bruised and bled after fights..?  Well, maybe this will appeal.  On the other hand, the God complex issue comes to the fore with Dr. Manhatten - an ordinary man exposed to a freak accident which gave him superhuman powers to defy time and manipulate matter.  Fascinatingly, as the other characters portray human foibles and issues, this character through his dissociation with our reality make him no less human in terms of being able to be manipulated, while on the other hand his abilities seem to serve to show the uniqueness of the human condition as he fails to understand the motivations of others.  And in short order, a few other things have to be mentioned - the acting is surprisingly good, the violence is surprisingly graphic in places, and the soundtrack is wonderfully eclectic.<br />In short, we have a very rare beast, a special effects driven blockbuster which has imagination and above all - brains.  Your view of this movie may well hinge on your familiarity with the original source material, but whether you have read the graphic novel or not, this is well worth your time, even if it clocks in at a way too long 2hrs 42 minutes.. in fact you may find you have to watch it again just to decide if you like it or not...
1591391105|3.0|The overall thrust of the book operates on an important but easily overlooked truism: you must focus on accelerating your learning & decision-making to get off on the right foot and dictate the course of your success during that critical honeymoon phase at the start of a new position. Sounds smart. And the exercises starting off seemed like they'd point you in the right direction, identifying your strengths & weaknesses in tackling this goal. But I just couldn't get going with it. I got bogged down & exhausted with the jargon and buzzwords and business speak. Maybe this is why I'll never truly succeed in business. Business books are just too dry and, well, business-y, to keep me reading.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I saw the film initially on Amazon Video on Demand. Subsequently, I saw the film with the original English theatrical subtitles on Netflix. The current Netflix streaming option is in HD and also features subtitles for the notes written in Swedish that occur in the film. I have also read the book and I prefer the movie to the book. I would have to say that some of the negative reviews here are simply by immature posters who don't really understand cinema.   Yes, this is an example of good cinema - the art of making a motion picture - and that encompasses many things including the film script, the acting, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the direction, etc. Some of the camera shots in this film are just incredible.   If you appreciate good cinema and really understand all that goes into it then you must see this film. It does pay to watch the film multiple times to catch all the wonderful craft put into it. Each viewing has only made me appreciate the film that much more.
B001PJ7TUE|3.0|When Prodigy broke out with \\"Fat of the Land,\\" I was hooked.  Every song on that album had a cohesive direction.  It was dark, it was throbbing, it was kinky, it had feeling.  \\"Invaders Must Die\\" doesn't have the intimate appeal of the former, and that is disheartening.  Many will argue that they're attempting a new direction, but I don't believe they should.  There's a reason they reached an international audience...they presented something that many wanted to hear.  Instead of branching off, they should have expanded on what worked.      The new album isn't bad, and is definitely a step up from their last.  They just need to get back to their roots and create something more sinister and controversial.  No single from this album will replace \\"Smack My Bitch Up.\\"

Our hero, Duke, is protecting a shipment of the most advanced warheads when his convoy is ambushed by an unknown unit with advanced weapons and superior information, led by a woman he knows.  The ambushers get away after G.I. Joe rescues the remnants of the convoy.  Duke and his teammate Ripcord sign on with G.I. Joe and go after the organization that ambushed them.<br /><br />First rate comic book fun.  Lots of explosions and gunfights, and larger than life heros.  What made it unexpectedly good were the backstories and histories of the Joe team members and their adversaries.  Duke and his ex-wife, the family history of the villain behind the ambush, the evil scientist behind the advanced warhead and others have a web of relationships that provide a depth that you don't normally expect in this sort of fluff.<br /><br />On the other hand, the laws of Newtonian physics were clearly suspended for the duration.<br /><br />Although it was a complete story, none of the key characters died, and the stage is set for sequel.  I'll be looking forward to it, especially to seeing where Lady J and Ripcord end up.<br /><br />Great fun with some unexpected layers!<br /><br />E. M. Van Court
0545128285|5.0|It's no secret to anyone that knows me that I love Harry Potter and fairy tales. In fact, my undergraduate thesis focused on A Thousand and One Nights while my graduate thesis touched upon J.K. Rowling's success as a literary celebrity. So being able to read The Tales of Beedle the Bard was more than a pleasure because it combined two of my favorite literary genres (yes, Harry Potter gets his own genre.)<br /><br />The book itself is split up between five stories, complete with commentary from Albus Dumbledore and the occasional added note from J.K. Rowling in case clarification was needed for Muggle readers unfamiliar with the wizarding community. Each story has a moral at its core, like Aesop's Fables, though some stood out more than others. Dumbledore's commentaries often provide insight, while incorporating history about the witchhunts and revision of fairy tales to become more child-friendly and less violent. From a historical perspective, I was so pleased Rowling included those aspects to give the book a bit more of a foundation.<br /><br />For me, there were three stories that stood out of the five: \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune,\\" \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart,\\" and \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers.\\"<br /><br />In the preface, Rowling comments that the female heroines in Beedle the Bard are far more assertive and independent than their muggle counterparts. Asha, Altheda and Amata, the heroines of \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\\" most certainly are, yet they share the same sense compassion as other female fairy tale heroines. I loved the story for its simplicity and its emphasis on the biggies of life: health, wealth (or at least comfortable wealth), and love. I loved that in their quest to reach the fountain, they ultimately give the honor to the luckless knight who accidentally got pulled through the wall with them. The fountain itself is revealed to have no powers at all in the end, indicating a subtle commentary on the intrinsic strength of women. Both feminist and a fairy tale, I am with the many wizards who found this story to be a favorite.<br /><br />\\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\" resounded with me because of its clever way of positing the love clause: that love inevitably leads to pain, whether physical, emotional, or mental. The titular character of \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\" has locked his heart away, so as to never feel the same emotions to which he sees the people around him surrendering. As anyone who has ever read the Harry Potter series knows, it's all about love. So to have a story that has an unhappy ending due to the overwhelming desires of love was especially intriguing, as it seems to contradict Dumbledore's repeated mantra of the importance of love.<br /><br />Likewise, Dumbledore's immediate commentary is perhaps the weakest of all his commentaries, elaborating on what it means to be without a heart in a somewhat vague way. Ultimately, Dumbledore ends up talking about how the term \\"Hairy Heart\\" has become an idiom commonly used in Wizarding language, without ever really getting to the point of why losing and finding one's heart can be so damaging. Indeed, the tragic ending of this story is far more reminiscent of traditional fairy tales due to its unhappy ending than the lighter stories given over to most tales in the 19th century and later.<br /><br />Finally, the story that made The Tales of Beedle the Bard famous: \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers.\\" This seminal story is at the core of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and is the same as the one told in the book. However the commentary is much more important. Dumbledore alludes to another tale, \\"Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling Stump,\\" in which it is uncovered that magic cannot raise the dead, a hint at his own efforts to bring his family back. It is in this last commentary that we see the more serious side of Dumbledore, more ready for analyzation than Rita Skeeter's biography of him as presented in the Deathly Hallows. I also loved what it suggestsabout Harry in his choice to put together his wand again, rather than to use the elder wand which had a history of death and destruction, as elaborated by Dumbledore in his commentary. Without being obvious, the Tales of Beedle the Bard are far more telling about the history of wizardry, Harry Potter, and Albus Dumbledore than even the books are at times.<br /><br />There were only a few moments where I was taken out of my literary reverie: the first is when Dumbledore refers to himself as a brilliant wizard in a note within the first commentary. It felt somewhat inauthentic based on the Dumbledore we met from the series who was careful not to flaunt his talents in a Lockhart-type way. Secondly, there is a moment where Rowling indicates she has been in touch with McGonagall. It made me question as to what sort of role Rowling is supposed to portray in this book, as opposed to the seven Harry Potter books, where she has a strict wall between her and the characters - she is the author and the characters are just that. While it may have been an attempt to demonstrate a more playful side on Rowling's behalf, it took me out of the book and gave me a moment of pause.<br /><br />It goes without saying that I loved this book, for all its details that I would have never gotten from any of the Harry Potter books, and also for its revisioning of fairy tales, making them simultaneously more modern and traditional at the same time. Definitely a book I will return to time and time again, whenever I reread the series (which I do at least once a year.)nd again, rather than to use the elder wand which had a history of death and destruction, as elaborated by Dumbledore in his commentary.

B0026J8LHM|3.0|I became a DT fan after playing \\"Panic Attack\\" on Rock Band 2 (and later on a real guitar), which is by far my favorite song of theirs. First off, to say that these artists have talent is an absolute understatement. These guys (Petrucci and Portnoy in particular) have got to be the most talented musicians in the biz. Petrucci, is an amazingly fast player, that will make Yngwie Malmsteen and Heraman Li cry foul. His arpeggios just plain blew my mind. Portnoy on the other hand, is by far the most talented musician ever. Not only does he have speed, rythym, and accuracy, but he is doing it all on a 50+ piece drum set with like 12 bass drums. This guy is just amazing.  Sadly, this album is held back by just plain awful singing. I was excited when I saw that Petrucci and Portnoy wrote the lyrics (while LeBrie does nothing, as always) but sadly, I found myself skipping to the solos.  I was also looking forward to listening to \\"The Best of Times\\" as it was a tribute to the late, Howard Portnoy. But I just skipped over that song all together (awesome intro though).  All in all, not a bad album, but I just can't stand the lyrics.  DT still rocks in my book, but this album will not be joining my playlist anytime soon.

When I finally did see it, I was taken back by how the story related to my life and I believe it will do the same for most people. It seemed for some time that movie makers were not coming up with original stories, but this is definitely original. Plus, it hits you in so many ways......enjoy!

B0000683DH|5.0|If Star Trek: The Motion Picture was the Star Trek film based more on the original TV series philosophical side, then the second would, perhaps, be considered the Star Trek film more in line with the action oriented side of the series. Yet while seeming to be action based, Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan would also have some of the series most dramatic moments as well. The result of this, in the hands of director Nicholas Meyer would be the best of the Star Trek films.<br /><br />To begin with the acting is pretty solid. The performances from the original series cast members are all well done especially int he cases of William Shatner, Loenard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. In particular Shatner and Nimor get some fantastic scenes together including one of the best staged and moving farewell death scenes in film history (even if it is only temporary). Also of special mention is the performance of James Doohan whose performance gets some additional (and excellent) material in the director's edition DVD version. Plus there are also good performances from other cast members including Kirstie Alley in her film debut and Bibi Besch amongst others. Then there is the villain...<br /><br />Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan, in my opinion anyway, is one of the all time great film villain performances. While Montalban had made quite an impact with the character int he original 1967 TV episode that performance was just the tip of what this film would reveal to the character. It's a layered performance with echoes, both in writing and in performance, to characters like King Lear and Capatin Ahab as Khan is revealed to be more then a genetically engineered superman in exile but a man driven to vengeance at any cost (hence the title). Khan's face-off's with Kirk are pieces of acting that focus your attention onto him which is even more incredible considering that the two characters (and presumably the actors as well) never come face to face int he film but spend the entire film facing off against each other via screens and communicators. It speaks to the power of a performance when despite that fact, the villain comes across as a real and imposing threat to the film's other characters.<br /><br />The film's special effects also remain top notch. This film remains a prime example of the power of pre-CGI visual effects not only with ships in flight but with the still visually striking battle sequences and things like the Mutara Nebula sequence and the formation of the Genesis Planet. The film also makes nice reuses of some of the effects footage from the first Star Trek film as well which, for once in a case of footage reuse, doesn't make the film look cheap at all. All in all it's rather impressive material coming out of a film that is fast approaching its third decade of existence.<br /><br />If the success of this film can really be credited to any single person it would be Nicholas Meyer. Despite Jack B. Sowards and executive producer Harve Bennett being credited as the writers of Star Trek II it was Meyer who did the (uncredited) massive re-write that brought together the film as it is. Whiel the script is firm in placing the film into being a science fiction action film, the film also a philosophical side as well. yet unlike its predecessor, the second Star Trek film is philosophical not about what's out there but about the human condition as it covers (without hopefully sounding clich&eacute;) the full range of the human condition including the emotional need for revenge, youth, knowledge vs experience, aging, morality, regrets and, most famously, death. Perhpaos the greatest example of this is the films use of the opening and closing liens from Dickens A Tale Of Two Cities as effective bookends to the film. Meyer also makes use of the film's rather limited budget to effectively create a vision of life in the 23rd century and the result is that this film, perhaps more then any other of the Star Trek film, seems to occupy a real worldthanks to Meyer's direction of people ranging from cinematographer Gayne Rescher to costume designer Robert Fletcher and the set designs of Joseph R. Jennings. Meyer proves that it is story, not just good effects, that makes good science fiction work.<br /><br />There is also the film's score. Then newcomer James Horner faced quite a challenge in trying to create a score that followed on from Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Yet Horner proved up to the task with pieces such as his main title music, the theme of the Enterprising leaving space dock (which reused the same footage that Goldsmith had scored to in Star Trek: The Motion Picture), the battle in the Mutara Nebula and the film's emotional finale. Whiel ti may lack the sound of the size of orchestra that Goldsmtih had Horner's score still has the power to add great emotion and tension to any scene it accompany. Indoing so, Horner kicked off a career that continues to this very day.<br /><br />Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan is the best of the Star Trek films. Why you may ask?

0786838655|5.0|I'm 30+ years old and love the Harry Potter series.  Since the end of that wonderful series, I've been reading \\"children fiction\\" in search of another entertaining series but most have ended in disappointment.      I'm glad to say however that Percy Jackson and the Olympians series is quite entertaining.  Its not quite as good as Harry Potter in terms of the writing but the ideas in them are original.   Another plus is that its no where as long as the Potter books so this is definitely a 1-2 day read without giving up sleep time.      In this first book where Rick explains his universe, essentially the greek gods still exist, they never went anywhere.  And as a result, there are 1/2 breeds or demigods roaming the world.  The down side is that these demigods tend not to see beyond their 13th birthday because monsters hunt them.  And with that the stage is set for Percy Jackson.    I've only read the first book so far and loved it.  I can't vouch for the entire series, but I'm definitely a fan as of now and have already ordered the next 5 books.  Its always fun when you find a series that engages you, and even better when you get in late and don't have to wait a year for the next book.

Would recommend the book or CD to every married couple, and person's that plan to marry some day. Wish I had this 30 years ago.

B0000640VO|1.0|She's not cute, any twenty-something girl that would act in this way is clearly psychotic.  I suppose we, the audience, are supposed to think she is an adorable, free-spirit type...but she's just completely insane, and should be thrown into prison.    Some of the rapid-fire comic bits were a bit funny...but VERY few.  I never for a second cared about where the plot (haha...plot) was going, or about any of the \\"kooky\\" characters.  I couldn't bring myself to watch this until the end.  That's my definition of a one-star film.
0385339682|5.0|I am an unabashed Grisham fan and think I have read about everything he's written.  I simply loved some of his books and I merely liked others.  There's always something special about his legal themed stories but some of the ones that I loved most were not legal at all:  \\"The Painted House\\",\\"Skipping Christmas\\" for example (which two were also favorites of my husband).  But \\"The Last Juror\\" was a standout special book for me.  The legal/lawyer theme is just an embedded part of the story while the principal theme is the unfolding development of Willie's character and the friendships he makes in the town, especially the lovely relationship between Willie and Miss Callie.  But all the characters are so finely drawn that you really get to know them and care about them or are at least interested in their fates.  Willie, warts and all, is one of my all time favorite Grisham characters as is the unique Miss Callie.  I won't go into the story line.  Others have done that quite well.  I'll just say that this is a book for all ages who like a good story.  My very elderly parents lived the last 3 years of their lives with me and I would read to them for about an hour every afternoon.  It was a time of companionship and enjoyment for us all.  During that time we covered many books and one of them was \\"The Last Juror.\\"  They were enthralled from the first to the last word.  My Mother paid the book the ultimate compliment for any story when she said, \\"Oh, I hate for it to end.  I want to hear more about Willie.\\"
0061122416|5.0|Every once in a while you can read a book that helps you grow as a person while at the same time being an enjoyable read, a fictional book. It makes finding the \\"self-help\\" a fun process, and offers a lot of enjoyable reflection and thinking topics. There is also a nice feeling that comes with this book, you feel nice reading it and after. It gets things going inside somehow. I think the message of the story, even though I suspect I might not \\"get it\\" fully, is very meaningful and had an impact on me. It seems that most people I talk to have read this book, but if you are one that has not and is considering it, I would say for sure read it! It is special. If you are on the self-help journey, the personal discovery and wellness journey also, take a try with [[ASIN:097430770X Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness]], which transformed my life and was one of the most powerful yet simple books I have ever read and used.
0887307280|5.0|This book is one of the most helpful small business books I've come across.  I've just started a business and this book has given me a good map of the road bumps I was about to run across at full speed.  I recommend this for anyone who has their own business or anyone who is even thinking about starting a business.  It is consise, easy to read, and it really spoke to me; I felt as if they were writing about my situation.  Buy it, you won't regret it.

B00280LYHS|5.0|i love this book it has everything action,humor and adventure i hope they make another book
0393061310|1.0|I bought this book as it was recommended by the Economist which is one of the few sources I trust for book reviews.  I was pretty disappointed.  The first thing the author does is go overboard to establish is liberal and open minded bona fides, doing this by assuring the reading audience hes going to base his finding on reasoned and balanced treatment; devoid of racial bias or supposition.  He then sets up classic straw man arguments promising his theories are more advanced then those numerous evolutionary psychologists and evil anthropologists that dare to foolishly use race as a criteria for judging human societal development.  Diamond, then guiltily, bemoaning these ills and the numerous bogeyman that fill academia (preaching racial differences as if anyone looking to retain their career or University job would dear, i.e \\"The Bell Curve\\").      After all this and more pretense Diamond then goes on to say he finds primitive tribesman more intelligent on average then whites.  Its hard at this point to determine which is more ridiculous: that the author just spent 20 pages bemoaning the insufferable inference that some racist fools may make against racial intelligence difference and its relation to societal development and then the author hypocritically doing exactly that himself.  Or Diamonds specious and vapid analysis of why the primitive island natives are smarter then western whites.  Appearantly inteligence counts for nothing in evolutionary biology in developed western societes compared to primitive ones, and putatively it takes more brain power to survive dieases in a primitive culture then a developed one.  O'Really?  I wouldnt be adversie to his premise if it wasnt based on the most feeble of analysis.  He also throws out the old lib standard country natural resource argument which I thought was beyond mentioning since they have been so thoroughly discredited.    All this nonsense occured within the first 30 pages which proved two things for me:     1.  The author is a huge liberal with the typical white guilty conscious and any analysis will be the poisoned pathological fruit of his inner guilt.  2.  Diamonds analysis skills are suspect even if you accepted his premise.    Given these two points the statistical chance of this book being worth finishing when I had a full list of more thoughtful and well reasoned reads was greatly diminished.  I decided to shelf Diamonds book.  I have heard he has authored a even more biased and poorly reasoned environmental book which im sure blames white people for all the worlds ills but I'm not buying that one after wasting my time on this juvenile and silly book.
0553260111|3.0|The movie version is known for its lightning paced action and the novel version couldn't be further from the truth.  Its not bad but there was at times information overload and the repetition in Bourne's inner monologue became tiresome.  Ludlum's ideas here are really good but the execution lacked at times.  I rarely like a movie better than the book its based but that's not thte case here.
0545123267|1.0|I didn't really like this book at all. I thought that the initial premise held some promise - trying to re-write [[ASIN:0316038385 Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)]] with more of an emphasis on werewolves as the romantic leads... but the changes made to the traditional werewolf myth fell flat. There was a scene with dogs that was utterly stupid - and it was obvious that this book was not researched enough. And the ending was just completely lame. There are MUCH better werewolf stories out there, for both teens and adults. I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone, particularly not teens. Parents will also be disappointed at just how ludicrously painted the heroine's family life is portrayed.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|This is one of those movies where I'm not sure I'm glad if I watched it or not..  At one point I almost turned it off because of the horrifying things they do to the children in the movie.  I did think there was a beautiful story within the plot that was quite touching.  I can see what all the hype was about.  But if I had known the horrors that lied within, I probably wouldn't have watched it at all.  I knew it would be about gritty street life in India.  But I guess I just wasn't prepared for the graphic things that happened to the children.  I am seriously haunted by some of those images & it greatly disturbed & saddened me.  So if you decide to watch - just be prepared for that.
B0000029LG|3.0|Arrived quickly, however, there was bad packaging- the cd case ended up being cracked and there was a huge scratch on the CD- it works ok, but maybe needs some bubble wrap or something...

B001PU8N0I|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie overall. The two main characters are impeccable in their conduct and character, and draw you into their lives, struggles and joys. This movie contains a variety of personalities from the very evil, to the silly and shallow. I was NOT at all pleased that they threw in a homosexual inuendo which somehow the movie industry feels they must do these days in order to be \\"politically correct.\\" I made sure to skip those parts when viewing this movie with friends and family, and unfortunately that side of the movie causes me to give it only a four star rating instead of a five. Also, there is some language in there as well. Overall, the story is very good and the acting is superb.
1594488916|4.0|It's fitting that Allison Hoover Bartlett name-drops \\"The Orchid Thief\\" as a favorite book of hers, because I kept thinking of the film \\"Adaptation\\" while reading \\"The Man Who Loved Books Too Much.\\" There are many times over the course of this story where the book seems to be about the writing/research of the book. Bartlett becomes so involved in the stories she is relaying to the reader that she worries that she might become some sort of accessory or liability.    The gist of it; a man named John Gilkey becomes a notorious thief of rare books. The fact that he doesn't steal for profit makes him difficult to catch, but rare book dealer Ken Sanders is determined to nail him. Gilkey just wants to build an impressive library and sees no ethical problems with what he is doing. But more than just a crime story, \\"The Man Who Loved Books Too Much\\" gently sets you down into the dizzying world of antique books; why people collect them, how much they are worth, where people go to get them, what types of things they look for in first editions, how few people actually read these books - I think it proves to be just an interesting as any other hobby. Maybe even more so. Collecting antique books is not a hobby of mine, but I sure did enjoy reading about it.    But this story feels inconclusive, like a raft just sort of nudged into a lake with no defining climax. Bartlett admits this herself at the very end, making a remark about how this story of John Gilkey is continuing to this day. But it still feels like an unsatisfying finish, a half-story.    Another thing you have to get used to, and I mentioned this earlier, is Bartlett's account of herself as she was making her way through this story. If you like to have your narrator 100% aloof and detached, \\"The Man Who Loved Books Too Much\\" will be rough sledding for you. It sorta upholds the theory that you can never truly observe something without altering it.    Aside from my two minor complaints, I really enjoyed this book. It wasjust over too soon. And that's saying something from me, being a slow reader.
B001UV4XL0|4.0|\\"I'm just difficult to kill, I guess...\\" - as soon as one of the main characters of The Perfect Getaway utters these words, you KNOW someone will try to prove him wrong. And they DO (try ;o) ). The story seems simple at first: a couple is honeymooning in Hawaii, while news spreads thru the Islands of a brutal murder of another honeymooning couple. The suspected murderers, a man and a woman, are still at large, but likely have not left Hawaii. As our city-dwellers hike thru the Park, alone and out of their element, can they trust the strangers with whom inevitably they cross paths? (OF COURSE, NOT!) And that's when an interesting twist takes this story from predictable to... well... no spoilers here! ;o)<br /><br />I did not have high hopes for this flick...I went to see it mainly because I have a secret crush on Milla Jovovich (if I were a lesbian, Milla and Mariska Hargitay from Law and Order would be my dream dates  ;-P...). Was the film perfect? No. Nonetheless, to my utmost surprise, I enjoyed this thriller far more then I did many supposed \\"blockbusters\\" this summer. It had some laughs, but was also quite unnerving, tense, and creepy with a light sprinkling of gore: everything a good thriller should have on offer. There were signs from the audience that I was not alone in my enjoyment. However, the film did develop its creep factor slowly. The story needed time before it graduated from \\"fluff\\" to \\"nail biter\\". In the end, the super plot twist more then made up for the wait!<br /><br />Two names are worth mentioning (in addition to Jovovich): it was the first time I saw Steve Zahn competently playing a complex \\"grown up\\" character, a role totally different from the usual \\"doofus\\" types he seems to favour. Also, Timothy Olyphant surprised me with his performance. His acting skills often leave a lot to desire. Not here. He was PERFECT as the perennially confident and \\"difficult to kill\\" owner of a metal plate in his head...
B0019OP0GU|4.0|I actually ordered 'ballet shoes' because I recognized two of the actresses.   I had hoped the story would be at least 'fair', I was pleasantly surprised!  I actually enjoyed the movie. I was caring about the characters; all of them,  not just the three girls. I was waiting and holding by breath as they were   waiting for news. I saw a family there and I was concerned for them. Wonderful!    Many likable characters in addition to the three girls shown on the cover.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you're thinking about buying this, then you probably should.  If you weren't thinking about buying this, then you should buy it anyways, because it's awesome.  Joss Whedon has brought together an amazing cast, including, but not limited to, Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, and Felicia Day.  And it's really nice to have Dr. Horrible on hand and playable on a large screen TV.
B0028T6XXY|2.0|This is a backstage. Good backstage, good news about him. But I believe Michael Bublé should inform his fans that this is not the full show, not if a thirds (or a fourth) of the show.  I think Michael Bublé is very good to let this happens and disappoint his fans.  Anyway - I knew all about it when I bought the DVD.   I thought that maybe, the other comments were too harsh on this DVD, but they weren't.  - I am still waiting for a GREAT DVD. This is not the one yet.
B0018YIFEK|3.0|I ran the gamut of emotions with this book. First, I was so depressed I thought I would stop reading it, then I was so hooked on it, I couldn't put it down and at the end, I was disappointed because everything seemed to wrap up so nicely, almost like the author ran out of time and just quickly wrapped it up and sent it off to her editor. The book caused me to look inside myself as to what I would do in this situation and I loved the fact that it really had no right or wrong answer to the issue raised. All in all, it was a very interesting book.

B001JNNDGA|4.0|In the last 20 years, which is the time I have followed the film industry closely, no other film has been more polarizing than Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. People either find this film a masterpiece or completely hate it and dismiss it as an ultra-violent snuff film with no merit. It seems that people's opinions are based on where they stand religously and I can certainly understand that. So I'm not going to add fuel to the fire. I'm simply going to talk about the technical merits of the film and the historical aspects that are covered in this movie. Also I will talk about the transfer to Blu-Ray since this is the film's debut in High Definition.<br /><br />The Passion is without a doubt, a showcase of Mel Gibson's filmaking know-how. He has certainly mastered the art of epic filmaking. Every frame, every scene, is beautifuly concieved. The pacing is pretty flawless and given the fact that the film is mostly spoken in a dead language, it is incredibly easy to follow and understand. A lot of hype surrounded the fact that the film would be done in the now defunct toungue as well as latin but in the end it doesn't matter. This is a visual feast. The subtitles simply confirm that you are understanding the scene at hand. In this film, the visuals and the incrdible score do most of the talking.<br /><br />Historically, the film is pretty accurate. I'm not talking about the Biblical aspects of the film (in that respect, some liberties were taken regarding what is written in the gospels). Whether you believe in the Bible or not is a very personal thing. I'm talking about how the time of 30 AD is portrayed and how the romans dealt with prisioners in that time. The rawness and brutality of the era is very well captured. Whether we can bear watching or not, whether we believe it is too violent for film or not, the fact is that this is how the romans tortured and crucified prisioners in the first century AD. It is brutal and raw. Whether showing that has any cinematic merit, I leave to the viewer.<br /><br />When first popping this BD on my player I got worried. The opening scene in the garden of Getsemani is, by HD standards, horrible. I don't know if it was the \\"day for night\\" effect that was used or the colors or what but this scene simply did not transfer well to HD. It is very grainy, lacks sharpness and the colors are subdued. I was about to think I had wasted my money when the scene ended and then all changed. After we leave the Garden and head to the other scenes in the film, the film comes to life in HD. Rich, beautiful colors, awsome blacks and great contrast. The textures come out clean and clear right down to the fabric in clothing. The slow-motion scenes (and there are a lot of them in this film)come to life on Blu-Ray. Overall an awsome transfer and one that showcases what High Definition is all about.<br /><br />Very Hard to review this film but if you pass by the religious controversy that surrounds this film, there is a lot here for the fan of filmaking and now for the fan of HD.to the viewer.

B001ECE6C6|5.0|I was expecting very little based on some of the reviews here, but this is first rate all around.  I've learned to expect good stuff from Metheny, but I can't get over how great this is. I don't understand those who say this isn't a real Metheny album. Does he need to be the only musician involved for this to be legit? That would cut out all but a few of his works. This is beautiful stuff. His own tunes all sound not just fresh but downright enchanting in these arrangements.  I was surprised to realize, though, that one of my favorites, \\"Black Words\\", was written not by Pat but by Jopek! This whole thing is a treat.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|If you got your hands on the recently-released DVD set of MTV'S The State, you've probably seen the teaser already.

My guess as to why it's taken this long is because of all the music.  The only original song was the theme song by Splendora \\"You're Standing On My Neck\\" and the rest were contributed by bands.  It usually takes a while to get the green light to use all that music.  Figured I'd give you all the heads up.  Stay tuned...

1416955070|4.0|Please let me state that I have never read any of the books that many people say the author copied from, therefore, I can't really comment on that factor of the book.  That being said, I believe this book is worth the read.  My best friend and I had just finished the Twilight series (a series that suprised me by being so enjoyable), and we were both going through some 'withdrawels' that often happen after a fun read.  I picked up City of Bones, and while it didn't grip me as much as the Twilight series, it did keep me entertained and I finished it in a couple of days.  It is no great piece of literature and it doesn't have the most original plot line.  But it is fun and provides and escape from every day life.  If that's what you are looking for, I'd say it is worth the time/money.

When Alcest's album arrived to me, I understand that this is not the same style as Austere, Alcest reflects the purity and the sadness inside the mind of a man.    It can guide you through the desolated paths of life, all across the pain and then set you free with a peaceful smile.    That is Alcest, the pure decadence of the insignificance of being alive.    NECROSADIK!

B0019LY5I2|5.0|I saw G.I. Joe Rise of Cobra earlier today and I have to admit I liked it far more than I thought I would. Duke Hauser (Channing Tatum), and General Hawk (Dennis Quaid) lead the Joes against the evil forces known as Cobra. Cobra wants to use nano technology to control the world, and only a special team like G.I. Joe can stop the Cobra organization to prevent them from destroying our world. From the moment this movie started to the very end it was action packed galore. Many people may be put off by the non stop action, but I found it a great escape and pure entertainment movie fun. If you like to go to the movies to watch a great action packed movie with no special message other than to entertain you than you will enjoy G.I. Joe.

Ariely's insights and arguments are shallow at best. take for example his analysis of \\"free\\". ariely argues that \\"free\\" has a hypnotic effect on people such that makes us make irrational decisions that do not maximize outcomes for ourselves. as evidence, he points to an experiment he performed in a mall where he gave people a choice of getting a $10 amazon gift certificate for free or paying $7 for a $20 gift certificate. he found that most people took the free card. amazing! or is it?    he argues that people should have taken the $20 gift card because it would give them a net benefit of $13 which is greater than the $10 the majority chose to receive for free. this is his evidence that the word or offer of \\"free\\" causes people to act irrationally.    ariely chooses to ignore a simple risk and potential cost that any rational person would have to take into account. what if the $20 gift card you paid $7 for was fake? given that potential outcome, wouldn't you choose to take the $10 free over the potential of being duped and losing $7?    the rest of the book is irritating shallow or semi-enlightening at best. i must admit that i found his analysis of \\"relativity\\" interesting. it's particularly germane to existence of any positive reviews afforded to this book. the other books on the bookshelves of people that gave this book a positive review must be utter crap...thus this predictably irrational must have seemed like a gem!    act rationally - take the $20 you'd spend on this book and take a buddy out to lunch instead!

B001TODCII|4.0|Taken / B001TODCII<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I think it's probably safe to say that no one is going to be terribly surprised or thought-provoked by \\"Taken\\". The movie is straightforward and simple, almost quaintly so in an era where we've come to expect every movie to have a dramatic twist ending in which it turns out that an ancillary character (the best friend? the aging husband? the bitter wife?) was the actual mastermind behind everything. \\"Taken\\" has no such twists, partly because they've become a bit overdone in the movie industry, but mostly because such a twist would have undermined Neeson's hard-earned 'I told you so' as well as the (probably unintentional) movie subtext that pretty young women should never leave their fathers' homes - or for that matter the motherland.<br /><br />Indeed, it's difficult to say how much of the movie is meant to be a searing attack on women... Neeson's ex-wife palatably drips evil and malice, and his darling daughter is almost a caricature of the stereotypical spoiled brat - throwing a temper tantrum that would shame a three-year-old when Daddy doesn't instantly sign off on an exotic European getaway. When the daughter and girlfriend are kidnapped into white slavery for being imprudent enough to flirt with an attractive stranger on a busy street in a foreign country, the sexually active girl dies almost immediately and is never mentioned again in the film. Neeson's daughter, on the other hand, is a pure-as-the-driven-snow virgin, allowing him a crucial extra few hours to try to save her as she is shuttled off to the expensive and exclusive 'virgin auction'. Although I'm probably reading WAY too much into the movie with all this subtext - after all, this is supposed to be a fun, mindless shoot-em-up, not a dissertation on the evils of society.<br /><br />All tongue-in-cheek aside, \\"Taken\\" is a fine action movie if you're just looking for people to get blown up, shot, and run over by cars. Quite a few of the characters fail to act sensibly (like the slave-trader who is uncooperative for no reason at all except as a method to work in a torture scene), and some of the action feels a bit too pretentious - like a deliberate attempt to push the envelope. For example, when Neeson shots innocent people in order to get their loved ones to cooperate - the action doesn't make sense and simply doesn't fit the character, but we're out to push buttons here, not build a believable storyline. I recommend \\"Taken\\" for a fun, mindless action movie to pass the time, but I wouldn't waste too much time trying to find sense in it - this is a spectacle movie, not a philosophical one.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollave-trader who is uncooperative for no reason at all except as a method to work in a torture scene), and some of the action feels a bit too pretentious - like a deliberate attempt to push the envelope.

3257229534|5.0|Having read 'Der Vorleser' both in German and in English, my full review has been posted for the English version, which is an excellent translation from the original.  [[ASIN:0307473465 The Reader (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage International)]].<br /><br />Schlink's German language is very suited to the harsh realities that the novel explores: dry and sparse and unemotional. In some ways it even increases the intensity of the emotional drama that the protagonist experiences. Michael, while not refuting guilt, shame, and atonement, is being led to examine and dissect the complexity of inter-generational conflicts brought out by the recent past in the context of his personal experiences. Schlink shows him grappling with the fundamental problem of the relationships between these two generations. It has meaning far beyond that time and the German context. [Friederike Knabe]
B002CMLIJ6|4.0|As a female fan I thoroughly enjoy the actions parts. You could tell that's where the money, and attention by the part of writers, director and producers (yes you, Jackman) went. I'll definitely get the DVD as many female fans are--for the Eye Candy! I love that Jackman is not so full of himself and that his first solo X-men flick--he spread the hottness around. I don't know if he did this because, he feels more comfortable in a group ensemble; or because he just rather give another actor a hand up. Nevertheless, in this movie you get to see more characters and a lot, A LOT of Fine Men.     LADIES TAKE NOTE:   Ryan Reynolds stands out as Deadpool--so much that a spin-off is in the works. His typical smarta$$ mouth comedy makes his one liners really zing. And the man can swing a pair of swords, and look bada$$ doing so.     Also, a lesser known Korean American actor/model Daniel Henney as weapons expert Agent Zero, makes his first appearance on a US movie. He's mostly known for Korean TV, Cinema and modeling. Yet in this flick, his supermodel looks work in his favor as he brings an icey sharp demeanor that make him one to take note of--and makes fans like me pray for a Agent Zero spin-off. His action sequence at the beginning of the film left me wanting more.     Friday Night Lights star Taylor Kitsch as Gambit was a big crowd pleaser in Comic Con, and he delivers on the big screen. This one might also have a spin-off in the future. The ladies sure love him and the guys seemed pleased with his deliver of the gambler as well.     Howevery I agree completely with other reviews. The plot was weak, and they didn't explain much about Logan's past (which was the purpose of the movie). We kind get a glimpse and quick run through and the rest is all BOOM! BAM! POW! All in all the movie was worth my money. I got a great night out with friends and a lot to drool over for. Thank you Jackman for all that nakedness! *shivers* I am totally still hoping this movie does well on DVDrelease. Cuz Jackman's such a good guy that he deserves it.       I hope in the upcoming spin-offs they do focus a bit more on the plot. Just a wee more than they did on this one. Cuz altho they might have felt the male comic geeks would love all the BOOM! BAM! POW! actions stuff, and female geeks would love all the nakedness and sexy...Sexy Men, we'd also would like a better story line to bring it all together. I think that's what made the X-men flicks work and do so well, so I hope they go back to that blueprint in future installments.
0060557818|3.0|Gaiman (re)writes the Heroes journey.  Like Luke Skywalker's tale, Richard Mayhew too must grow up and become the Hero.  He too loses his first guide (OB1), picks up new band of rabble rousers (Han, Chewie, the droids) bent on protecting the royal lady (Leia) and must decend into a Labrynth (cave) where he must slay the Beast (himself/vader/fear) before facing off against the big Evil (Palpatine/Vader) before helping the girl save the day and become knighted in the process.    But Richard lives in 21st century London Above.  He's a number cruncher who, in helping a wounded \\"street urchin\\" finds that no one knows him, his apartment is rented while he's still in it, his bank fails to recognize his PIN and no one can see him...except those from London Below.  In pockets of time, those who have slipped through the cracks of society live under London in a completely different world.  There, the rats rule, rat-speakers translate, various kinds of people exist for indeterminate amounts of time, and many have unique abilities.  And here, he befriends the \\"street urchin\\", the Lady Door on her quest to find out who killed her entire family and why.  Will he find his way back to London Above?  Will he go back?  Will he stay?      I found Richard oddly like Arthur Dent from the Hitchhiker's Guide...reacting rather blandly to such oddity and unusual occurrences. The pace of the book was slow to warm up, the assassins way too comical, and oddly unfulfilling where Door and Richard left things...to possibly be picked back up.  I think Gaiman, so used to leaving much on the panel and the art to convey, didn't really grasp the characters or story as he fully could have.
B00008G9JM|4.0|A Passion Play - (1973) 2 Tracks (45:08)  *** ½ Stars<br /><br />This follow-up to Jethro Tull's Thick As A Brick certainly has its moments, but sounds a little bit cobbled together in my opinion.  It just may simply be a case of too much too soon after the success of TAAB that Ian Anderson thought \\"Well, surprisingly it worked once, so let's just try it again.\\"  I much prefer the edited version of the main track that is found on numerous greatest hits packages of JT.  Now, I will admit, I have only listened to this a few times, and I know some great pieces of Art have to soak in for awhile for the individual to truly appreciate it, but I don't think I'm ever going to be saying this particular Tull album is great.  Another reviewer stated that people seemed to either \\"love it, or hate it\\".  I don't hate it, but I just don't \\"get it\\".  Only recommended to completists that want all of Jethro Tull's albums.<br /><br />This digitally remastered version includes an \\"enhanced\\" bonus track, the video of The Hare Who Lost his Spectacles along with a theater progamme.
B0018KW3XS|5.0|Last night we saw the complete Ballet in wide screen and color.  It was shot in Paris where the company was on tour.  As an extra there was an interview - primarily with Alicia Alonso - and some clips of her dancing earlier in her life.  And the performance of the Cuban Ballet is great! 6 stars were it possible.

0316017922|5.0|\\"I am ashamed to say that I am one of the few Americans to beg the question, \\"Who is Malcolm Gladwell?\\" With a cult following on hand (which is the main reason the book was recommended to me,) Malcom Gladwell's series of books on success, achievement and life have been New York Times Bestsellers for good reasons.    Outliers helps anyone from any background understand what makes a successful person. Although it is a reiteration of many things your parents may have or have not said, Gladwell creates a prose with scientific evidence on success. The evidence shows instances of controllable and uncontrollable variables that helped successes like Bill Gates and Hockey players born at a certain time.    Everyone has an advantage even if they believe they are disadvantaged; this is something every college student should hear --- minority or not. The bare-boned advice in this book is a great motivator for anyone to cultivate and assess their assets for success.\\"

B0002GTWYW|3.0|Widely heralded as a classic, this would've been a great album had it stopped at about 10 songs. I like about 10 songs, most of which are still forgettable...<br /><br />I really don't see the hype though, lyrically its cool, but musically it sucks... There is really no variety, it all deals with the same subject matter, killing people, selling drugs and club songs... Everyday Struggles works as a breath of fresh air and Suicidal Thoughts is nice to... but the large majority is about, as I said, killing, drugs and club songs... I doubt the majority of the album would appeal to anyone other than the hardcore rap fan....<br /><br />I'm not hating on Biggie, I think he is one of the best rappers as far as skill is concerned, but this album is not as good as people claim... This album and Biggie are quite possibly the most overrated rapper and album in hiphop history...
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Received the DVD before the projected date. Purchased a used disc and was in fine condition. This is one of Clint's best movies ever. Funny and tearful and a good coming of age story. Everybody that has seen this movie has something positive to say about it. Great movie.
B000002J09|4.0|I'd like to start this review by quoting one of the naysayers:    \\"Led Zeppelin is for only the shallow ears. Most serious music fans and critics disregard Zep\\"    I'm getting a bit tired of this attitude, not just in regard to Zeppelin, but with all aspects of music criticism. The idea that Led Zeppelin are artistically and culturally worthless because 'serious' fans/critics (whoever THEY are) have decided it should be so is laughable. What exactly is a 'serious' music fan? Someone who loves to listen to the music that gives them pleasure, who tries to further their appreciation of it wherever possible? Or someone who only takes pleasure in obscurity for it's own sake and enjoys sneering at us sheep-like masses with our harmless appreciation of The Riff? I suspect the latter. Let's face it: music attracts more snobbery and elitism than any other subject (wine included). And words like the above are all too tiresomely common. It seems its not acceptable to like something and be done with. No, it has to descend into a superiority contest where the line of argument is 'I don't like this and I'm obviously very intelligent. You do, ergo you must be stupid'. It's the sort of tedious, specious logic that ends up constantly defining rock 'n roll as primitive and inferior, while chin-stroking experimental jazz and 4 hour ambient wankathons assume the status of a spiritual quest. No-one likes to be told by some self-styled 'expert' that they only enjoy something because they are too simple to know any better.    Zeppelin are one of the most well established, well respected and successful rock acts of all time. They have influenced generations of musicians and bands. They have sold millions upon millions of records. They can still sell out a massive arena if they want to. Before you trot out the argument that the opinion of the majority is no gaurantee of quality, how many other bands still have the same massive following some 40 years on? And not just with their original fanbase, but with those who weren't even born until after they split?    Led Zeppelin 4 may not be their best record. It's a matter of opinion. I actually prefer 'Physical Graffiti'. But its a damn fine rock album.     If you don't get it, then that's fine. We don't all have to like the same things. But it's an act of supreme arrogance to assume that you don't like it because you're smarter than everyone else. Who exactly are you trying to convince? Rock music may not always be the most cerebral, but it appeals to an area of the human spirit that is just as vital, and just as important.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Game is addicting and fun.  It is not to difficult to learn, and you must change your strategy every time you play.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|If you like old-fashioned (1940s-50s) epic movies then kick back on the sofa and enjoy the morning, afternoon or evening with Australia.  This movie is long and ambitious.  A lot of it is cornball but it works for this retro-movie.  It is a big drama and suspenseful at times.  Very sentimental, I did tear up a couple times.  The cinematography is often gorgeous.  I thought Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman had plenty of chemistry.  And the Aboriginal boy is a doll!  Effective villains, well played by the actors.  I paid $9 and it's worth that.  I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars.  May watch it again and amend.
B000000HHE|4.0|Gee...I don't subscribe to the idea that the good old days are better (or worse) musically than now, but,  I dunno, De La Soul's \\"3 Feet High and Rising,\\" (along with records like the Stone Roses album) sometimes make me think that 1989 was some sort of high watermark for popular music.     Calling a record a 'classic' or 'landmark' loads on a lot in the way of expectation, but this album can easily carry it off.   It doesn't need stuffy admiration or solemn praise.   It's fun. It just is.     Originally I had the vinyl with the tricky cover that didn't wear so well.  From Amazon I got the anniversary version of the CD with the bonus disc and I'm glad I have it.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|When I bought this cd, my intention was to check it out. I listen to it a couple of times and thought the music was pretty cool.

0553582445|5.0|FitzChivalry is a beautifully developed character, of course, but The Fool has to be one of my favorites of all time.   Part Legolas, part Groucho Marx, the shenanigans he pulled to extricate himself and his friends from a long series of dinner parties at a boring country weekend had me screaming laughing, which is not something I ever expected from a fantasy novel.  The book is funny, suspenseful and sad in equal measure.  I just loved it and am looking forward to reading the other two.  Robin rocks!
B000FC11A6|4.0|I started reading Neal Stephenson with Snowcrash - probably the best possible place to start reading Neal Stephenson. Cryptonomicon was the second book of his I read, and it startled me not only with it's not only with its writing, but its absolute departure from Snowcrash. Aside from a technological arc its about as different from SC as you can get; that was Cyberpunk, this is more like Historical Fiction blended technological.<br /><br />The book alternates between three plotlines, neither of which seem to have any particular direction in mind. The first is centered around young Bobby Shaftoe, a WWII marine, and his unabashed traipsings around the world. The second involves a naval cryptographer, Lawrence Waterhouse and his similar travels all over the place at about the same time. The third involves Lawrence's grandson, Randy Waterhouse, as he spends most of the book (with this portion of the plotline set in the late 90's) navigating a corporate and legal labyrinthe involved with setting up a data haven in the Philliphines. Towards the end of the book the book somewhat abruptly shifts to him conducting a search for a big pile of gold.<br /><br />Honestly, I liked the book, Stephenson lends himself to interesting character development (Bobby Shaftoe certainly is), but he rambles his way through the book flying off to parts unknown to make minor points. At one point he spent 2 or 3 pages, discussing a wisdom tooth removal to make a minor metaphor for a character. Other times, he discusses highly technical topics, involving encryption or hacking which may confuse some people.<br /><br />None of the plots seemed to go in any particular direction. I kept looking for a goal or an objective to any of the plotlines, something interesting, but it really lacked. It was sort of like a guy following each of the main characters around with a notepad and then writing a book out of the notes. I got up, read emails, went to a business meeting, met someone interesting, had drinks at the bar, etc. The book is around 1100 pages, so props be to you, if you can take all of that.ook is around 1100 pages, so props be to you, if you can take all of that.

1933771690|5.0|This is a brave new book.  For me, it exhibits the same courage as the 2006 [[ASIN:1416542744 The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief]].<br /><br />In the August '09 issue of Discover Magazine, Roger Penrose participated in an interview in which he states that physics has been looking in the wrong corners.  He believes some of the newer theories may not be valid and calls for a new way of thinking.  That's how I recall the article anyway.<br /><br />The same week I read this magazine, Amazon delivers Biocentrism to my doorstep.  While Lanza and Berman may not be kindred spirits with Penrose, they most certainly attend the same family reunion.  That is, I believe Biocentrism addresses a large part of the problems espoused by Penrose.<br /><br />This book sets forth a new look at the universe.  Lanza and Berman contend that our current theories of the physical world simply don't work.  Instead of placing life as an accidental by-product, the authors place life at the apex of universal existence and purpose.  It is a very thrilling and disturbing read.  And I also could use the adjectives, compelling and relevant as the arena of physics seems to be moving in a direction of silliness (multiverse, string theory, etc.) that can possibly never be proved.<br /><br />While the proposals made in Biocentrism seem radical and counter-intuitive at first, a bit of reflection will soon make the images clearer and place us on the pathway to a better and more commonsensical mindset.<br /><br />You may also enjoy [[ASIN:1594488770 Fingerprints of God: The Search for the Science of Spirituality]], [[ASIN:0671797182 The Mind of God: The Scientific Basis for a Rational World]], [[ASIN:0547053584 The Goldilocks Enigma: Why Is the Universe Just Right for Life?]], [[ASIN:0465036732 Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape The Universe]] and [[ASIN:0387988653 The Conscious Universe: Parts and Wholes in Physical Reality]]<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.<br /><br />Michael L.

0545123267|4.0|For anyone who loves supernatural young adult novels, Shiver will give you chills. This book was so well written, and had such complete and lovable characters. I love the way Maggie Stiefvater switches the narrative between Grace's point of view and Sam's, each with a unique voice and set of emotions. The writing really is beautiful and subtle, yet powerful enough to stick with you.<br /><br />Here is an example, from Chapter 13 - Sam<br /><br />I was a wolf, but I wasn't Sam yet, either.<br />I was a leaking womb bulging with the promise of conscious thoughts; the frozen woods far behind me, the girl on the tire swing, the sound of fingers on metal strings. The future and the past, both the same, snow and then summer and then snow again.<br />A shattered spider's web of many colors, cracked in ice, immeasurably sad.<br />\\"Sam,\\" the girl said. \\"Sam.\\"<br />She was past present future. I wanted to answer, but I was broken.<br /><br />It gives me chills just reading those lines again. Before picking this book up, I was told that it was better than Twilight, so my expectations were high. Considering that Shiver is about a werewolf and the girl he loves, I was afraid that I would find myself comparing the two books. Without a doubt, there is no comparison. Shiver is completely unique - from the legend of the werewolves all the way to the tender love story between Sam and Grace. The secondary characters were especially powerful. The friends and family surrounding the two main characters were not simply a vehicle in which to get the two lovers together, but they had their own stories, their own motivations, and their own importance in the overall story.<br /><br />A part of me wants to say that the book ended too abruptly, but another part of me believes that I simply didn't want it to end at all. Shiver is one of those books that I will pass around to my friends, and my friends' teenage daughters.<br /><br />Speaking of those teenage daughters, I want to say this book is appropriately young adult. There is a love story, and there is definitely chemistry between Sam and Grace, but it often is achieved with the simple touch of a hand. There is kissing and one love scene, but I feel Stiefvater kept it PG-13.<br /><br />Movie Potential? Definitely.

0307588335|4.0|I read the good and the bad reviews of this book and found both, in my option, to be true.      McDonald speaks of his journey to the trading floor at Lehman and his experiences there.  He grants us one man's perspective of those tulmultuous months before Lehman's colapse.  This is the book's strength.  He puts us there, in his shoes, tell us what he experienced.  I knew nothing about the world of the trading floor, now I at least have the beginnings of an understand. It makes it worth reading (I listened to it driving on a long trip).      I wish, however, the book had more to say about his personal life during his time at Lehman.  Especially after giving a detailed account of his early years.  A single line mentioned a failed marriage.  Twice a girl friend was brought up.  He took a gambling trip with a trading floor buddy of his.  Was trading Lehman his whole life as the book seems to indicate?  If so, I do hope he has found  other interests since he left Lehman.    The book might had earned a fifth star in my rating had he ended he book when he left Lehman.  From that point on the book tried to explain what happend in the executive offices on Lehman 31st floor.  He had had little informaion he could contribute to any source, even an unnamed one.  He nearly lost that forth star by ranting against the former CEO and president of Lehman.  Clearly working at Lehman was more than just a job to him, and his feelings towards those who brought her down was understandable.  They may even be justified and true.  They were not,however, well presented.  The explainations Lehman's final death throes were cut and dry, and not well don at all.    Will there be better books out there for the layman the the MBA to understand what happened?  Yes.  But this one is readable and accessable.  One could do a lot worse as a start.
