B003L20IFQ|4.0|I loved the movie. The story was done very well, and Ryan Reynolds does surprisingly well. It was the ending that got me. I can take a character dying. I just didn't like all the unanswered questions. His family, where he really was, who put him there. Just so more specific details--conflicts that were introduced and never addressed.<br /><br />I mean, the ending, I say it wasn't good, but in a way it was. The way they tease you is brilliant. That part I love. Its the questions left unanswered that annoyed me. Still, worth watching!
B0094OLFUW|3.0|I'm not going to use the word Disappointed because I really didn't know what to expect from this album. I Was hoping that their music would progress from the last album...but I was very let down after listening to this Album..If your a fan of there music in general I think you expected more from this album. This album is very boring....Very repetitive with the same sound/melody. The album sounds like one boring sad song with only a few songs actually standing out. The production was not nearly as impressive as the first album. I believed they played it safe on this album, and by doing that they left out any originality. No new concepts, they didn't even develop off of there own style, it sounds like a totally different group.Starts off pretty well but gets worst as it goes on.... I do not plan to keep this album in my iTunes....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this game because its not only one game it's a bunch of great games and a lot of fun.
B00138H876|5.0|Lots of crying the blues. I enjoyed the change that this album showed a different side of Dylan. I would recommend this album to all my friends and friends. His hurt at his marriage breaking up is clear one can feel the hurt.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|All war is hell.  The Marines in the South Pacific during WWII were issued the mother of all feces sandwiches supreme. If Liberty in Melborne was considered heaven; then, a warm can of peaches was unobtainium, a letter from home was and forever shall be--Salvation itself.
0439023491|5.0|OMG! What to say about this book? So much happens that I didn't expect, as I'm sure other readers didn't as well.<br /><br />\\"It must be very fragile if a handful of berries can bring it down\\" says Katniss to President Snow, (pg 22). And I thought `did she actually say that to the president? No, she didn't'; but she SO did! Go KATNISS! That was one of my favorite parts of the beginning. It was hard to put the book down and stop reading.<br /><br />So back to The Games previous victors goes, when they thought they were safe from EVER having to be in the Games again. The 75th Hunger Games is special, and the Capitol doesn't want anyone to forget \\"that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol\\". A male & female from previous victor Districts are chosen to once again battle `til the end in the Hunger Games. Groups of allies are formed and they help each other out, though they know only one has to survive. Katniss & Peeta are both trying to make sure the other is the final victor, and this kept me thinking which of them two cares more for the other. I'm not gonna say `love' the other because well, thought Peeta did profess his love for Katnis, she feels kind of being pulled in two directions - one leading toward Peeta, and the other towards home, to Gale. So, I'll just say they care for each other. They say in every relationship there is one who loves more than the other, and as hard as it may be to say, I think in their relationship we all know it's..... Well, Im not gonna say it! LOL.<br /><br />The ending was quiet shocking! I didn't expect it to be like that, but Im glad it did. I can't wait to find out what happens next? Here I go! =)
B00932A2MC|4.0|Movie was good ,lots of action,it seems like it was the navy version of Battle of L.A. with the Marines ,and the ending was the same like all the other movies that had that old battle ship in it ,like Steven Segal where all the old men refight WWII and save the world.
0439023513|5.0|WOW!! Last book of the Hunger Games...and I was hesitant to finish - afraid of what I might find at the end of the tunnel (lol), but I made it through. Here goes my review.<br /><br />So, Katniss is trying to adjust to living on District 13; they come to see Peeta's alive but what he says to the camera and the people of Panem makes him look like a traitor to his friends & fellow tributes who were trying to save him. Kat (I will call her Kat for short here), decides to take a stand and be what they want her to be: the symbol/leader of 13 by agreeing to be their \\"Mockingjay\\" but not without a few demands - her main concern is pardoning Peeta & keeping him from any harm, along with all other victors from the Games. I like this part she tells Plutarch: \\"The tributes were necessary to the games too. Until they weren't. And then we were very disposable-right Plutarch?\\" Pg 130. You can see her strong character coming through in what she says soemtimes. Kat is very strong and we've all come to see that throughout the books; she has grown from the girl who volunteered for her little sister, to the strong soldier we come to know in the Mockinjay. Here is another quote I loved: \\"I knew you'd kiss me.\\" \\"How?\\" \\"Because I'm in pain. That's the only way to get your attention. Dont worry Katniss. It'll pass.\\" (I forgot what page this is in)Wow...I felt Gale's pain & how much he cares for Katniss here.<br /><br />So we move on.... Peeta's being held captive & tortured by the people in the Capitol, & a team is sent out to rescue him, one of which is Gale. However when they do get him back the see he isn't the same Peeta who loves Kat, and who kept her safe in the Hunger Games; he's been messed up in the head by what was doen to him in the Capitol. He tried to strangle Kat, and seems to have been brainwashed into thinking she's evil somehow. So while they set a team of specialists try to help Peeta recover back to his old self, thou they dont think he'll ever recover 100%. Kat decides to leave District 13, away for a while, since it's too painful to see him like that & goes to another district to try & assist others in the rebel cause; anything to NOT think of him. So the districts have come to an agreement to charge & overthrow capitol; Kat tried to shut Peeta out of her heart, but she doesnt completely - She doesnt give up on him though...she cant. A group of Victors is set out along with the camara crew and trek thru towards the Capitol, but seems as if they were back in the games; with mutts & poison gas being thwarted at them on their way. They do make it but they lose some comrades along the journey. I was sad to see certain individual go...not saying who. I will say this I wasn't expecting this one MAJOR thing that happened once they reach the president's mansion. I kept reading hoping that Kat had gone delusional from some invicible gas or something because I just didnt wanna belive THAT happened. It was HEARTBREAKING to say the least. So, towards the end...I was in tears!! & by such a small thing too! (I wont give it away for those who've yet to read this one). I absolutely LOVED these books, I dont know how else to express it! I always felt like I had to keep reading to find out what's next & to not leave 'em hanging; though i tried to prolong finishing it for as long as I could, but couldnt keep it up long. And once again, I have to say a HUGE THANK YOU!! to Yianna for this great gift! I will end with this quote, which I think it's my favorite, among others, but...*sighs*: \\"You love me. Real or not real?\\" - \\"Real\\". And...curtain!

0525478817|5.0|Wisdom, incredible insight, humor, sex, deep sympathy, skill, concern with a capital C: this author 'wrote' all those things. Hazel and Augustus live with me..I can't say when this has happened before ...but I am glad it has,now.  They are great kids.<br /><br />NO.. way this book shd.just be listed in YA.. It is a book for the ages...all ages that is over about ten.
B005UKJX4E|4.0|This is one of those films where you can't meet it where it's at.<br />The film needs to meet you where you're at, and if it does...<br />If it touches your experiences, your emotions, your pain, your significance, your unity with the cosmos, than it's a therapeutic experience. Sometimes no words a fellow human speaks can sooth your soul, and sometimes you're tired of turning to books. This film met me where I was, and it gave me something to move forward with based on my own experiences with human nature, existentialism, and things I value.<br /><br />I didn't leave the film with answers, and neither am I looking for answers. But I left the film feeling acknowledged, that I wasn't alone in my experience of nature verses grace, or love, or personal significance, what is fair or what is right. Someone on screen expressed emotions that I am all too familiar with, but keep hidden from others. Thank you.<br /><br />I give this film 4 stars because although it has significance to me, I don't think it's something that should be rated. I am not going to recommend this film to any of my friends, I know that they will not enjoy it. All I know is that it's a good thing for me, and I am glad that I own it. Sometimes I can stargaze from dusk to dawn, sometimes I only last a few seconds. Same scenario.
B002MW50KO|5.0|This has got to be one of the most honest, well done and weirdest Christmas albums I own.  It Must Be Santa is great and makes you want to sing along.  Bob's voice is getting older, but that suits the material well.  He's very sincere in his approach, and I like the Hawaiian element of Christmas Island too.  Again, lots of Bob at the piano by the fireplace here, with white candles lit and sung well.  Good choice of material and again, recalls a style of holiday record not normally done.  Well done Bob and thank you for this gift of music and mirth!
1451648537|5.0|This book was fantastic.  I hate reading, I am usually bored quickly and never finish.  However, this book was awesome.  I could not put it down easily and when I did I could not wait to get back on it.  The only problem was that I ignored my wife and kids for a few days while I was addicted to reading it.
B0000C8AW7|5.0|I recall buying this CD on the day it came out, right as Borders was closing early for the day for obvious reasons.  This was my link back to sanity and something tangible that I could identify with....go figure it was a Bob Dylan album, but still...it did the trick.  This is a fun record, Bob and his band having fun and laying it down solid with a look forward and a look to the past, but done well.  Great bluesish, country swing playing on the uptempo pieces with Bob sitting at the keys a lot, ...it is subtle, but the piano surfaces here and there.  I found a certain irony with one of the songs having a strong echo of Eddy Duchin & His Orchestra's recording of Snuggled on Your Shoulder's arrangement, but it suits the pedigrees and since not many others would notice it, who cares?  It is an echo to an earlier time that Bob draws inspiration from and that America has left behind without really recognizing the richness of what was created in that era.  I digress...the songs are solid, some have a sense of humor to them and Bob's singing carries it through and well.  Very good and strong...not to mention loud....this CD carries a sonic punch that can blast if you aren't expecting it...and that's a good thing.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This movie takes a very unique look at the cultural and linguistic barriers that exist in our world. I really enjoyed the way Babel incorporates stories from families living in different parts of the world and ties them together. Not quite a five star for me, but still very interesting.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Picking up seamlessly from Love and Theft, Modern Times (a title with its own sense of irony...wonder if he watching Chaplin's movie when thinking it up...), this album rocks.  Thunder on the Mountain has an infectious chugging romp that also applies to several other tracks....old, but new, and refreshed in being in the present without being of the present.  Great gentle ballads, some charming, some dark, but quintessentially still Dylan.  He uses his voice to great effect on the quieter work and the piano is becoming more prominent...I wonder if Bob will do an all-piano record some day....who knows?  very good and in keeping with the high standard in place.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was great! I highly recommend it! It really gave you passion for the characters and really made me think.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I can't deny that Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children boasts a really fascinating hook; by incorporating strange and unusual vintage photographs into the book and the story, first-time author Ransom Riggs creates an odd blending of fantasy and \\"reality\\" of sorts. And there's no denying that the pictures are compellingly odd and even somewhat unsettling, even without the context of the story around them. But in the end, without those photographs, Peregrine is a fairly generic YA adventure story, one that does a lot less with its premise than you would hope. The book is strongest in its earliest chapters, as the reader attempts to investigate the mystery of these photos along with the protagonist, and questions whether they're plunging into a land of mystery or chasing a made-up story spun by a master raconteur. Unfortunately, the answer to all of that ends up being a lot less interesting than the mystery, especially since it involves just another variation on an X-Men style team of unusual powers and odd children. The book attempts to overcome this by developing a bit of a mythology as it goes along, but it's never a particularly compelling or original one, and by the end it devolves into something I never expected: a book that's really pretty generic, complete with the now-obligatory setup for a trilogy of tales. I had high hopes for Peregrine, and in the early going I thought I'd found a compelling look at the way we use mysteries and myths to make sense of the horrors of our own world, or a fascinating peek into a world of oddities and misfits. Instead, it's just another bland YA adventure book, one that doesn't have much to recommend it beyond an interesting hook that never functions as more than a gimmick.
0786852550|5.0|This is a very fine trilogy, written for young adults I suppose, but suitable for all ages. I found the characters engaging, the plot entertaining, and the ending {to the trilogy} a pleasant surprize, rather than predictable. Harry Potter became boring, for me, after awhile. I finished this set with regret, wishing for more. Martha Wells, and now Jonathan Stroud, are of the limited number of authors able to create, for me, characters and plot that smack of reality in a fantastical world.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|From start to finish, the album just captivates you from track to track. The music is just as epic as the music he makes with Two Steps From Hell. Definitely a must buy for epic music fans.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|So the world is awash in sound bites cell phones iTunes etc.  and Mr. Dylan is an old dude who sparkled like a flame throwing out genius diamonds over the years.  He lost me with his god stuff and then with his cowboy boots and rock and roll revue stuff with that honky tonk bluesy 4bar boogie stuff wrapped around his husky armadillo voice I fell for it.  Sometimes.<br /><br />I love this album.  What a dumb irreverent topic for a title song.  But what I did was shut everything off, purchased the 5 dollar mp3s and sat in a hotel room in Wichita Kansas on a business trip and listened to it in my underwear all the way through on my iPad.<br /><br />Few artists I will do this for.  Not Springsteen.  Not the new mumford and sons.  I just relished in the power of rock and roll's Renoir or Jackson Pollock, which ever.  Or both.<br /><br />Bob is the man.<br /><br />It's as simple as that.  To create such a genius album in the twilight of such a career?  Please.  Everyone find a hotel room in Wichita, Kansas, shut everything off, and listen to this  album.  In your underwear..

The details, the blu-ray, everything arrived in top condition. Thank you very much for this incredible product. It arrived safely all the way to Brazil.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I enjoyed watching this show from the beginning, there was no lag as far as getting our characters introduced. Awesome show, can't wait for season 2.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I read this book on my kindle fire. At first I was a little skeptical of how great the experience would be. I have to say the story was very good and the art was amazing. I really liked the black and white pictures and felt that it added to the overall experience greatly. The way the art is done makes the story feel a lot grittier and dark. The story is very well done, I found the book very hard to put down.<br /><br />The overall format of the book on the kindle was good. I did like the continuity of the book from one to the next it flowed great, and did not feel like a break in the story when transitioning from one to the other. The pop out tile feature while reading allowed me to see things in a greater detail and made the pictures much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of great stories will love this book, if zombies are not your thing you should still give it a try. The story evolves around the main characters not the zombies. It become more of a tale of survival after the fact. Robert Kirkman said that he wanted to capture what happens after the movie ends. He wanted to look into the human condition and experiment with unimaginable circumstances. I feel that he nailed it right on the head. This book is amazing and I cannot wait to read the rest of the series.<br /><br />If I could I would give the book over five stars, a definite must read for veteran comic readers and first timers.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Nice change from the typical puzzle games.  Nice graphics and pleasant background music.  I wish there were more levels.  Highly recommended.

I tossed it on a table one day and it made a loud bang but nothing was wrong with the Kindle.  I would buy another one if needed and would let others know how good it is.
0525953728|1.0|The author betrayed his colleagues, his profession, and his oath.  I can only imagine his motivation was a quick buck.<br />He's done a dishonor to the Navy SEALs.<br />Shameful.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is an excellent presentation of preparing your E-book for Kindle publication.  It is best read BEFORE one begins Word Processing the book.  However, value is not at all lost, even if this book is read after the book is written.  Original mistakes in Formatting can be adjusted for.<br /><br />This is a thorough presentation.  In fact, it has alerted me to the necessity of obtaining professional help for Formatting, Cover choice,etc.  High Value for this alone.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  5 Stars.

B005LCECU6|5.0|John Rutsey (RIP) was a very good drummer. When I first picked up the second Rush album, \\"Fly by Night,\\" I noticed a couple things. The album actually had cover art, an owl looking menacing graced the cover. My first thought was that this meant the band had moved to a softer direction, probably on company orders. On the back cover, I discovered that Rutsey had been replaced by some guy named Neil Peart. My thinking went something like this...commercially appealing front cover, early personnel changes, they dumped a very good drummer for an unknown, sophmore slump, this album is going to suck but I'll give it a shot. I put it on as background music to study calculus. I didn't even make it to my chair before I recognized how amazing this new drummer was. I turned my chair around to actually listen to the first track, \\"Anthem.\\" Outstanding...but they always put their best song first. Surely they can't keep it up. By the conclusion of \\"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\\" on the first side, I was a beleiver. Neil Peart jumped ahead of Keith Moon as my favorite drummer. But how could this guy develop such a powerful and truly unique style of drumming and materialize out of nowhere? Can Peart drum this well live or is he just a quirk of the studio?<br /><br />Well, he could drum live and this CD reflects that. I'm wondering how it must have felt to see Rush when this CD was recorded. Concert attendees were familiar with their hit, \\"Working Man,\\" and maybe even the rest of the first album. Behind the drumkit and not near the stage, many folks probably thought it was Rutsey. Can you imagine seeing Neil Peart during an early performance not knowing what a legend he would become?<br /><br />This CD is a magical performance, especially if you imagine seeing the show. For a bootleg, the recording is superb. Heck, I've heard many official releases that didn't sound this good. As a document of early Rush, this is an amazing find. I'd say it's a must even for the casual Rush fan.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Really follows much of the book...very good to visually catch what I imagine while I read! I just devoured the series as a purchase because I was out of the country when released and so I had to wait for the DVDs.
0743454537|4.0|My Sisters Keeper is a really awesome book, but its very dramatic. This story is about the Fitzgerald's who find out their two year old daughter has cancer. Kate needs a donor but her brother is not a match.<br />So they decide to have another child so that Kate can live. They have the genes set up to where the baby will match Kate's.<br />Thirteen years go by of Anna and Kate being in and out of the hospital. None of the things Anna has donated has been major yet.<br />But when Kate's kidneys start to fail her, Anna once again is expected to donate. But this time Anna is tired of donating.<br />I really like all the characters in the book because they all have a way of looking at things I would recommend this book. But you have to be able to read sad things so this book is probably not for young readers. My favorite part is when you finally get to hear Kate's side of the story. But the ending is also my least favorite part because it has a tragic ending. Read the book to find out more. Will Kate end up living?<br /><br />Written by Taylor County Middle School student Chloe
0307341550|4.0|A riveting tale of murder in small-town Missouri and the perverse, often evil characters who live there, \\"Sharp Objects\\" was masterfully written and is difficult to put down. A fast-paced, hard-boiled look at the darker side of small-town America. I would have given the book five stars, but had trouble accepting some of the unlikely scenarios behind the crimes. Beyond that minor detail, though, it is a phenomenal, well-written story.
B000M341RI|4.0|Received the DVD promptly and with no shipping problems.  I was replacing the original VHS tape format, and had not watched the movie since about the time of release quite a while ago.  I laughed so much and remembered why I enjoyed the movie in the first place.  Very enjoyable!!  I must admit that I haven't taken the time to watch the bonus disc, but look forward to doing so in the very near future.
0156027321|4.0|Winner of the prestigious Booker Award, \\"Life of Pi\\" is a wonderful adventure that holds your attention from the first page through the last.

B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book and read it every couple years, now I have it at my fingertips, with the kindle app.
0439023521|5.0|One of the few modern YA novels that lives up to the hype. A very good post-holocaust dyastopian story reminiscent of Lord of the Flies and some 50's SF short stories that were anthologized in the Orbit annuals. Harrowing and engaging.
B000ZOSMTW|3.0|The product itself was excellent which contained great songs with great compositions.  The band is awesome but it would have been better if the product was available in an HD version.  The video seemed a little fuzzy after being used to watching TV in high definition.  Other than that it was great!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I am a person who likes youtube a lot. so naturally, when I got my kindle fire, I watched it on this since I could take it anywhere in the house. well, I got pissed off from the words being so small and the inability to change the quality. that's where tubemate comes in. I can use a youtube optimized to fit the size of my kindle fire. also, not only does it allow you to change quality, but it allows you to choose a preview option which lowers the audio and video quality if you just want to skim through a video. also, I can download 4-5 videos on the go if I know it will be a long trip. I'm not saying that you HAVE to get this, but it would be cool to check out and see what it's like.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|City of Ashes is a great story.  I've never been much of a reader but I can't wait to get home from work to find out what's coming up next for the characters.  This book has comedy, flirting, suspense and at times horror.  Not sure if we need to have all the gory descriptions of each monster but I can certainly visualize what's going on. I would definately recommend this book.
0062059882|3.0|The premise of this novel sounded intriguing enough to purchase this book - something I rarely can afford.  But - the ideas - and there are many - don't add up to a whole novel. Perhaps a few novels, if given more substance and time. I wanted very much to be immersed in an epic adventure, but it often felt uneven - short stories cobbled together in the midst of a promising tale. Some of it was very absorbing. Yet, I couldn't quite suspend disbelief for long enough.
B007VT6QSI|3.0|I haven't actually purchased this album nor do I plan to; However, I was curious to see if/how much Bieber had matured along with his voice. So while I was bored and doing some work on the computer I listened to his album on YouTube. Has his voiced matured vocally? For the most part, yes it has. Is the album more mature sounding? Yep, it is. Yet, this album still is no where near the worth $16. Before you Beiber fans get your feathers ruffled I'm not bashing him. He's a decent singer and I know he is an easy target to pick at, that is NOT what I am doing here I am just reviewing his music.<br /><br />\\"Long as You Love Me\\" and \\"Beauty and A Beat\\" are about the two best songs on the album. \\"Boyfriend,\\" and \\"All Around the World\\" are also catchy additions. Almost all of the remaining songs on the album fall into the mediocre to bad categories for various reasons.<br /><br />The absolute worst song for me on the album is \\"Thought of You.\\" I'm sorry but no man trying to present himself as mature and sexy should attempt to hit high notes (in a chorus no less!!) that make him sound like he just got kicked in the balls. I am not saying he is the only teen male pop singer to do this (Justin Timberlake, Jesse McCartney) but in my opinion it sounds terrible! Don't do it guys!!<br /><br />Maria is a song about that psycho chick who claimed Justin was the father of her baby. While I understand his need to vent somehow and music is his forte it wasn't very classy. He should make more mature decisions if he wants people to view him as a more mature artist. A mature artist would write a song that subtly expresses his feelings, not blatantly singing and naming a song after the person. Does everyone know Taylor Swift sings about guys who did her wrong? Yep! Is she naming songs after them? Nope. What message is Justin sending to young girls by naming a song after Maria? Hey claim Justin is your baby daddy and he'll write a song about you too!! Really? Nothing mature about this.<br /><br />On the flip side \\"Catching Feelings\\" and \\"Die in Your Arms\\" sound like Boys 2 Men and the 70's had a love child. Seriously, these songs are just way too mature for Justin to sing. Maybe when he turns about 40 they will be a nice fit. You can hear it lyrically, Justin just hasn't lived and experienced life enough to pull these songs off convincingly. Because of this the songs are dead boring to listen to and Justin sounds dead bored singing them.<br /><br />The majority (not all) of the rest of the songs on the album are syrupy pop ballads whose sole purpose is to make girls under the age of 18 swoon and mediocre filler songs. While some people may be partial to one or two of the rest of these songs, for most listeners there is nothing here to write home about.<br /><br />My biggest issue is that this album is a mixed bag. Now that can be a good thing if it's done correctly but in Believe's case it's not. I could just picture about 20 different people pulling Justin in about 20 different directions. This album seems to be a disorganized mix of pop, R&B, & rap. While I understand Justin is young and still trying to find himself as an artist there aren't any songs that serve as a middle ground transition song between his switches (if that makes sense). If you listen to the album all the way though you'll get a better idea of what I mean. It seems to jump from a pop sound to an R&B and then back to pop in a \\"that just came outta left field kinda way.\\" Musically, the songs are ordered awkwardly and in general are just not organized into a smooth and natural transition that one comes to expect from a seasoned artist.<br /><br />Would I recommend this album to you? No, not unless you are a die hard Bieber fan or have listened to the album somewhere else before you purchase it. I think the majority of people will do what I plan on doing which is buy 2 or 3 of the top songs on the album and save the rest of your hard earned cash for something that is a more of a complete package. Is this album horrible? No, of course not. Justin has a lot of potential and over time he will hopefully develop into a well respected and seasoned adult artist. Unfortunately, his first attempt is mainly a flop. This is mostly because he is just trying way too hard to be this new and improved adult Bieber. You don't jump from one side of the ocean to the other. You need to sail across it. Bieber tried to leap over the ocean, but fell into it instead. He's still afloat and hasn't sunk yet. He needs to swim back to shore, slow down, and sail across. The journey to becoming a man isn't something that happens overnight. Nor is the journey to becoming a great artist.

B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I've read everything by Jane Austen, even her juvenalia, and *Persuasion* is my favorite. It's one of her shortest. It was published posthumously, and I think that she meant to flesh it out or add subplots, like her other books.<br /><br />As it stands, it's a wonderful work. *Emma* is supposed to be Austen's masterpiece, but I think *Persuasion* is a more mature work and, probably, more personal. The main character Anne Eliot is Austen's best character: mature, responsible, intelligent, and more wise than witty. She was persuaded to not marry for love when she was young, but to wait for a chance at a wealthier man. That chance never came, and now Anne is past her bloom, probably unmarriageable, and her inane father and sister are shoveling the family's little remaining money out of the coffers as fast as they possibly can. Anne gets a second chance with the man she loves, a chance that Jane may not have had.<br /><br />It's beautifully, and poignantly, told.<br /><br />I love Jane Austen. I tend to love writers and read everything that an author has written, and Jane was the first author who I fell in love with.<br /><br />V.
0525953728|5.0|I thoughly enjoyed this book.  It showed the less often discussed part of war (and life) - that missions rarely go as planned and it is the perseverance of very special people that create sucessful outcomes.  After reading this book, I now realize that their sacrifice is even greater than I had anticipated.  This is much more than a book about the UBL mission.

B008Y1RTUG|1.0|This is a very slow paced film where very little happens for long long long stretches. The brief battle scenes are completely uninspired and no different from a thousand other films, and it is chock full of 3rd-grade level Disneyesque animated creatures which might entertain a child. Fact is, a lot of these Disney creatures seem to be just thrown into the film extemporaneously as a substitute for an actual plot and as a filler for the long periods where nothing happens; or perhaps they were tossed in just in case there were some three year olds in the audience. A lot of the \\"special effects\\" bordered on the ridiculous or inane, such as when the \\"mirror mirror on the wall\\" uses the \\"liquid metal\\" imagery from Terminator 2, to create a liquid metal man which stands before the queen to tell her she is beautiful. Totally ridiculous--so much could have been done with a magic mirror, but this director has a liquid metal man pour out of it. LOL--ridiculous. In addition to having almost no plot, this film suffers from really bad acting. Whereas Charlize Theron is a total A+ babe and an excellent actress, Kristen Stewart has almost no acting ability, and her facial expression never changes. Fact, is, Kristen Stewart has a very masculine face and looks like an unpleasant worn-out street strumpet, a harridan, and somewhat of an evil hag, at age 20 or whatever she. My opinion, she is rather ugly and it is painful to watch a movie starring an unpleasant mannish young woman who can't act, can't smile, and has no charm or personality when at the same time we're supposed to believe she is playing the part of an innocent angelic beautiful princess. If she had pulled out a bottle of whiskey to take a slug, or stopped to shoot up some heroin while hiding in the woods it would not have been out of character given her persona. This is simply a very boring movie with a lot of bad acting and a very dull plot.
0143119680|2.0|Based on a too-quick scan of the description in the book review, I thought this might be similar to A.S. Byatt's Possession, which I loved.  Instead it is much closer to Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey.  Especially excruciating in the audio version.  Unless you loved Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey, skip this.  Trust me.

When I heard it was going to be released in 3D, I pre ordered it immediately with Amazon. I just received my copy yesterday and watched it right away...The picture quality combined with the 3D effects have made this movie absolutely astonishing...can't wait to watch it again!!!
B002AS463W|1.0|I saw this movie about 20 years ago. Recently some friends and I were talking about 50 Shades of Grey and I thought about this movie so I said \\"Let's get it and watch it.\\"  I had forgotten a great deal about the movie.  I just remembered it being explicit and thought it would be interesting to compare it with 50 Shades of Grey.  Bad mistake.  It is terrible.  The lead male character and the plot is so demeaning to women.  I hate that I wasted $3 to purchase it.  I threw it away.

B008CP6RWU|5.0|First off, since its release last spring, Journey is and has been, by far, the best game I've played all year (I highly doubt Halo 4 will be able to change my mind about that).  In fact, it's one of the Top 3 gaming experiences IN MY LIFE.  It is, in short, an amazing achievement in gaming and art in general, a moving experience that lives on well past this relatively short game has been completed.  Its simplicity and haunting sense of loneliness is something that is incomparable nowadays.  This IS what gaming should be about.  Don't get me wrong, I love series like God of War, Uncharted and Halo, but Journey stands all on its own.  thatgamecompany's two other jewels (Flower and Flow) are equally mesmerizing and unique, albeit nothing quite grabs at the heartstrings like Journey.  Overall, if you didn't get the game on the Playstation Network, THIS IS A MUST.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it so much fun ideally enjoy this game and it is easy to follow the rule I enjoy the mystery of the game two thumps up
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I can't believe that the game actually expects you to pay real money in order to play.  At first I thought there had to be a way to get cash, without having to actually purchase it, like maybe if you waited, or perhaps once you got a certain amount of coins they would turn into cash... but no.  There is absolutely no way to get cash unless you buy it.  How ridiculous.  I spent quite a bit of money on the game in the beginning, because I really wanted to build up my town until I stopped myself and thought, \\"What the heck am I doing?\\" This is crazy!  I even bought energy once thinking that if I bought energy that it would increase the energy stores, but no. It didn't increase the capacity for energy at all it only bought the 15 energy one time and once it ran out that was it.  9.99 for five mintues of game play.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  I'll keep it on my kindle fire because it is fun, but I refuse to spend any more actual money on it.  If there is something I can't do unless I have \\"cash\\" then, oh well...

0439023521|5.0|As a writer, I am sometimes brutally critical of others work. Not a keen reader of others works. However the Hunger Games both as a book and now on DVD, is one of the most thought provoking and HONEST works I have had the pleasure to read and WATCH as a movie.<br />I was impressed by the directors' work. The characters, the production and the book in itself are as close to how future wise WE WILL BE as a HUMAN race.<br />I've read some critics reviews re the book. We are by our nature a cruel and sometimes brutally savage race of beings. Suzanne captures the essence of that brutality and if Katniss appears a little cold and indifferent then lets not be critical of her attitude in that sense. Why should she NOT feel, be aware of the savage cruelty of those who purport to be kind? To be caring ? When she knows and no doubt fears, the terrible realization that what she dreaded has come to fruition.<br />If she has to kill to survive? To win at all costs ? Who we ask put her there in the first place, WHO decided her course of action, her chosen path ? The reality show? Lets face it, reviewers should stop bleating about the scenario being anything but plausible. We only have to take a look at the current reality situation to understand the truth on that !<br />The Arena has long featured in human activities from the Romans to the Greeks and across the centuries in one form or another. For true honest SPORT or for savage games, brutal consequences in the hunt to the death.<br />Love the book, loved the movie and due credit to Suzanne for her brilliant work, read the book as it is not how YOU want to perceive it as anything but HONEST. Savage, cruel and indifferent, just like us as so called HUMAN beings, sometimes sad to see that that is so close to the word HUMANITY. We are often anything BUT !
B007T99ENE|5.0|An intriguing story set in the intrigues of post War Britain, the Cold War, the secret doings of MI5, MI6 and the CIA.  Wonderful narrative, which includes writings by Tom Haley, a writer recruited unknowingly  by the beautiful Serena Frome into a complex scheme involving writers being paid to allow their ongoing creativity to flourish - as long as they toe the party line.  McEwan evokes the era superbly, the differences between the old and new univerisits, the conservatives and the 'hippy\\" generation, the Pill and sexual freedom, the trade union movement and the uncertaintly of the IRA.  And what a final twist!

B007M45PMU|4.0|I looked for this album after a customer at the restaurant I work at played the lumineers on his ipod over the speaker system. I was intrigued and saved a note in my cell phone to make sure I looked them up. After listening to some of the songs I took the leap of faith and bought the whole album. I havent regretted it at all, this is a refreshing folk rock album that has gotten me dancing (sober), singing along (drunkenly), and generally picked my day up whenever i listen.<br />The lyrics are not pointless drivel or repetitious nonsense, the instruments are above average with interesting drum lines, and the singing balanced with occasional harmonies.<br />I recommend the purchase, you won't regret it.<br />If you remain uncertain then you should listen to Flowers in Your Hair + Submarines to dance, Classy Girls + Ho Hey for drunken singing, and Flapper Girl + Dead Sea to hear a slower side.<br />ENJOY
B002V9PEU4|5.0|Ok first off, yes its one of those movies where theres a little kid tagging along and he's kind of the \\"told ya so\\" type, but this movie is classic, there are random cameos in this flick that make you say \\"Oh ****!

It was even more funny to me since i had just finished watching \\"The Witness\\" right before i watched this and they made a reference to that film too. Good flick.

0345529057|3.0|...of this lot of volumes anyway. Having seen a few episodes of the HBO series, I thought I'd give these a try.<br /><br />First of all, full marks to Mr. Martin for a prodigious imagination, bringing into existence this world and its peoples and races in all its detail. Mr. Martin clearly loves his imaginary world and has vested much TLC in its creation. However, for this particular reader, there's far, far too much detail - pretty early on, I started getting lost in the various families and in remembering who was who, and I was never really sufficiently interested to refer to the lists at the back of the book. Moreover, as the story went on (and on, and on...), the pace noticeably dropped, and by book 4 I was starting to skim over masses of detail, trying to follow only the main story thread. There are some genuinely interesting characters, both good and bad, but they tend to get lost in this welter of detail. Even worse, one of the best, Tyrion, is actually completely missing in book 4. There are oases there, but there's an awful lot of desert in between them. So I plugged on across the desert, partially to see what happened to the interesting characters (Daenerys, Arya, Sansa, Jaime, Cersei, Tyrion (where'd he go?)), but also partially out of a sense of duty, to finish what I'd started.<br /><br />So, will I get Book 5? Probably, again just to finish what I started (What? TWO more books after that???? (Gulp!))<br /><br />Oh yes, there's another struggle too - to get them back into that nice slip case! Because they're big, thick paperbacks, which spread with being held open, it's a major effort to get them back, and my case started to split. Perhaps the publisher should have allowed for this.
B008ANFRGQ|4.0|I have often felt as though Vai albums were almost too much,-preferring to watch the DVD's instead. His last two DVD's were just ridiculous (great) I really think this music should be mixed in 5.1 because it is almost too dense for the stereo field at times. This is state of the art guitar playing..modern, quirky, intricate, and intense.<br />Steve Vai is just immense. What more needs to be said? The guy who wrote the review calling this album \\"boring\\" just baffles me. How can playing like this be boring? boring compared to what or whom? This is a strong album. Reminds me of an extension of \\"Passion & Warfare\\" There are some Zappa-like moments as always and a really twisted old yet new blues tune.<br />The solos on \\"Moon and I\\" are...absurdly awesome. I paid $13.00 for the actual CD. A worthy purchase.
1476712042|5.0|What a truly amazing story! It gripped my heartstrings from the start to the very end!<br /><br />Jamie McGuire tells the story of Abby, the good girl, and Travis, the bad boy, and their intense roller-coaster ride romance that had me totally captivated. The chemistry, passion and unconditional love they had for each other had me addicted to this novel and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I enjoyed each and every character and look forward to reading about them again.<br /><br />Would I read this book again? Absolutely!
1416550534|4.0|This is the first book of Morton's I've read, and I loved it. In some ways, it reminded me of Ian McEwan's Atonement which deals with the injustice of the English class system and the tragic consequences of an unforgivable lie. In this case, it's a white lie that seems harmless. The tragic hero in both novels is even named Robbie!<br /><br />Some reviewers have said they wanted the story to include more about Grace and her later career and romance. That would have been interesting, but this is a story about secrets and lies and the danger of lying or misleading because, ultimately, we are powerless to control the consequences of our deceit.<br /><br />I was moved by Grace's story and I too teared up at the ending, which I thought was poignant without being overly sentimental. Yes, there are some plot developments that you can see coming and others that feel a bit contrived, but for me the book was so well written I didn't mind.<br /><br />And, yes, the story is sad...but beautiful.

1439153663|4.0|In her novel, \\"The Kitchen House,\\" Kathleen Grissom interjects much heart into the people interconnections between orphaned Lavinia and her adopted family of black slaves, even if some of its players rely upon cartoon-ish stereotypes and the plot revolves around a progression of grim realities that are so dire they crush all hope and blight even the reader with a tsunami's brute force and determined inundation that feels sour and overdone. The audience's despair is punctuated by the fact that the historical point in time doesn't always reflect the early 19th century setting or its early New Nation flavor.  In fact, the voices of the two women who narrate \\"The Kitchen House,\\" know little about the world outside their Virginia tobacco plantation and quite frankly, I doubt they care very much.  Perhaps in  terms of the actual events of the story, whose universe incorporates a small microcosm outside the larger world, this is normal and natural--recently during Hurricane Isaac, this reviewer lost power and satellite television--if it weren't for the car radio, there would have been no exposure to the goings-on outside this small sphere of influence.  More importantly, personal troubles, in a way, insulate and anesthetize one from the larger catastrophes of the bigger environment. Nevertheless, Grissom may concentrate on her crafted mini-planet as her women live it, but the multitude of tragedies weighs the work down and spirals it into the realm of disbelief.<br /><br />Grissom crafting of a post-Revolutionary war atmosphere suffers from the needs of the story.  I greatly doubt that any immigrant Irish girl who has lost her parents and is set to work in the kitchen of a plantation would ever be able to consort with the likes of the plantation owner's wife's family as she grows into young adulthood.  Although this contrivance suits the storyline well, from a realistic standpoint, it falls short and suspends belief.  Lavinia's eventual blossoming into the status of \\"lady\\" after scrubbing out the kitchen sink seems far-fetched indeed.<br /><br />Add to that the prescience of any reader already familiar with the usual dramatic slavery themes.  As soon as predictable and formulaic \\"Southern Plantation Event A\\" occurs (e.g. an unjustly treated slave breaks curfew), the savvy reader immediately anticipates B: burning crosses, C: whippings, D: lynchings, E: sell-offs or the separation of families and F: all sorts of other inhuman cruelty just because it is what it is. Grissom doesn't let up on this diabolical aspect of slave life or the stupidity of a system that sadly and freely discounts the worth of human life.  There are so many `uh-oh\\" and \\"oh-no\\" moments designed to depict the helplessness of the Papa George/Mama Mae family that the reader quickly relinquishes any possibility of any sort of a happy ending where the protagonists do more than still breath on the last page. As Grissom jam-packs as many of slavery's defects and their corresponding effects on her characters' lives as she possibly can, she ratchets up the terror, disappointment and misery to a point where the reader will roll his/her eyes in deference and beg for mercy--or at least a shorter termed horsewhipping. (Just kidding!)<br /><br />She relies on characters like the arch-villain Rankin, who puts the two into two-dimensional--a drunken scoundrel who uses the slaves for quick relief and whose agenda is only to keep the blacks in line with the same relentless anger of the archetypical Simon Legree of [[ASIN:0486440281 Uncle Tom's Cabin (Dover Thrift Editions)]].  Her Captain Pike--the owner of the plantation can accrue a fortune, run the plantation and his ships, but cannot seem to get his house in order or see that his son needs protection. Mr. Waters is the pedophile tutor responsible for upsetting the otherwise idyllic lives of the Twelve Oaks' children and Marshall, Captain Pike's hapless son who epitomizes the deteriorating standard has no solid purpose other than to run his family's holdings into the ground.  Because her whites (with the exception of church-going Will Stevens) support the system of slavery, Grissom portrays them as weak, corrupt, enraged, power-crazed and ultimately doomed.<br /><br />On the other hand, all her black characters seem outwardly benignly subservient.  However, when it comes to taking care of business, where the whites fail--doping themselves with either laudanum, liqueur or an unconscious acquiescence to \\"the way things are\\" whenever times get rough, the blacks reach down into steel cores, maneuvering events and people to ensure a troubled yet familiar status quo.<br /><br />It is in this respect that Grissom achieves a narrative that although pockmarked with one tragedy after another, still compels the reader to discover what does eventually happen.  She endows the first portion of her story, when Lavinia is a child with much more detail.  With a sure command of her characters' interrelationships, she reveals the plantation's ugly underbelly and the ensuing sorrow, rage and frustration that such an insular system brings to all effected.<br /><br />Of the two narrators, Belle seems to have more authenticity.  Her comments regarding her love of Ben and her wary relationship with Lucy are fraught with good humor and sting with the bittersweetness of making due.  As the story draws to a close, her voice sings out with more strength; her monologues lengthen as her basic nobility reaffirms itself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Grissom takes an opposite tack with her other main character and narrator, Lavinia.  Her actions in the final third of the novel seem weak and unsubstantiated.  As a child, Lavinia shows understanding and perseverance; she stands tall for Marshall when he needs her and mothers little Sukey without blinking an eye.  Her subsequent weakness and penchant for drugs seems only a deus ex machina that ensures the safe passage of the remaining players in the denouement after the climatic fire scene.<br /><br />From a wider scope, Grissom underlines the limitations of each of her character categories.  Miss Martha, the Captain's wife is so bored and warped by her ill-conceived idea regarding her husband's relationship with Belle that she fizzles away her precious time by dosing herself with opiates.  The Captain knows what he must and should do yet, he falters indecisively when it comes to insuring Belle a good future.  His failure to recognize Marshall's tormentor or the malicious cruelty of Rankin pigeonholes him as a product of his own need to keep his plantation afloat at the expense of others.  Ben, Mama Mae, Belle, Lucy, Uncle, Papa George, Ida, Beattie and Fanny work around their inferior status, finding small meager happiness by whatever means works, being fully aware that joy and security is an ephemeral variable. Lavinia equates contentment with the warmth of her iconoclastic memories.  When reality doesn't facilitate her expectations, she, too, falls short--jumping to immature conclusions, deciding that she can fix the unfixable and knuckling under when reality finally hits.  Marshall fritters away his fortune for the sake of fostering anger ignited and fueled by the maliciousness of others.  Grissom seems to be commenting on the inability of people in general to find contentment even in an idyllic place.  For the bored Miss Marthas of the world, there is laudanum to dull the pain of ineptitude and ennui.  For the idealistic that crash after reality hits, drugs exist to numb the pain.  For the ill-equipped successors of family businesses there is violent sex with the slaves and brain-quieting alcohol.  In the character of Meg, Grissom writes in the only personage that seems at rest--she has her botany and unconventionally refuses to fall in with the rest who conform through marriage and ultimate subservience.  The others have little control, distorting the very concept of what it means to be free or owned.<br /><br />I listened to the audio book version of this novel performed wonderfully by Orlagh Cassidy (Lavinia) and Bahni Turpin (Belle). Orlagh as Lavinia speaks with a brogue as a child and lightens this as she grows older.  Bahni Turpin endows local color and personality to the character of Belle.  All in all, the story in this format kept me well entertained.<br /><br />Bottom line?  If you enjoy pre-Civil War stories set on a Southern plantation and are prepared for the cruelty rained down upon the slaves by unjust overseers and clueless masters, you might enjoy Kathleen Grissom's \\"The Kitchen House.\\"  Be prepared for some situations that will suspend your belief.  Be forewarned that a \\"happy ending\\" for this tale just means that most of the characters are still alive by the final page.  Grissom may be setting up to write a sequel, which if I can listen on audio while exercising or driving, why not?  Recommended with some caveats.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"c fire scene.<br /><br />From a wider scope, Grissom underlines the limitations of each of her character categories.  Miss Martha, the Captain's wife is so bored and warped by her ill-conceived idea regarding her husband's relationship with Belle that she fizzles away her precious time by dosing herself with opiates.  The Captain knows what he must and should do yet, he falters indecisively when it comes to insuring Belle a good future.  His failure to recognize Marshall's tormentor or the malicious cruelty of Rankin pigeonholes him as a product of his own need to keep his plantation afloat at the expense of others.  Ben, Mama Mae, Belle, Lucy, Uncle, Papa George, Ida, Beattie and Fanny work around their inferior status, finding small meager happiness by whatever means works, being fully aware that joy and security is an ephemeral variable. Lavinia equates contentment with the warmth of her iconoclastic memories.  When reality doesn't facilitate her expectations, she, too, falls short--jumping to immature conclusions, deciding that she can fix the unfixable and knuckling under when reality finally hits.  Marshall fritters away his fortune for the sake of fostering anger ignited and fueled by the maliciousness of others.  Grissom seems to be commenting on the inability of people in general to find contentment even in an idyllic place.  For the bored Miss Marthas of the world, there is laudanum to dull the pain of ineptitude and ennui.  For the idealistic that crash after reality hits, drugs exist to numb the pain.  For the ill-equipped successors of family businesses there is violent sex with the slaves and brain-quieting alcohol.  In the character of Meg, Grissom writes in the only personage that seems at rest--she has her botany and unconventionally refuses to fall in with the rest who conform through marriage and ultimate subservience.  The others have little control, distorting the very concept of what it means to be free or owned.<br /><br />I listened to the audio book version of this novel performed wonderfully by Orlagh Cassidy (Lavinia) and Bahni Turpin (Belle). Orlagh as Lavinia speaks with a brogue as a child and lightens this as she grows older.  Bahni Turpin endows local color and personality to the character of Belle.  All in all, the story in this format kept me well entertained.<br /><br />Bottom line?

B0084IG8TM|4.0|In a spoof of Saturday Night Live, Sophie Vergara played a reporter capturing the hunger games in a sketch. It was hilarious but I had to put it in there somewhere. The story is a compelling one about a grim futuristic society where the former United States has been demolished and broken into 12 districts and a capitol. Every year, a boy and girl from each district is brought to the Capitol for training and to be launched literally into the hunger games where kids kill other kids.<br /><br />The premise might come across as bizarre but the film does a faithful job in capturing Suzanne Collins's novel. Jennifer Lawrence deserves her second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in her performance as Catniss Everdeen, a teenager who takes her younger sister's place in the games. The younger cast members who play the 24 all do a fantastic job in believable life and death performances.<br /><br />I bought this DVD 2 pack which includes several extra features like the background of the popularity regarding the trilogy, the making, the message from the Rose Garden, etc. which is worth having. Since the novel is taught in schools, the DVD will be helpful in the classroom as a teaching tool in bringing the story to life. It's a disturbing tale but is worth learning about war, famine, droughts, and society overall.<br /><br />I have to say that I was a bit disturbed by the outfits, costumes, make-up and hair of the Capitol denizens who seem bizarre and detached from the yearly grisly event.<br /><br />If I am disappointed, it's because we don't get to hear from the author, Suzanne Collins about her classic trilogy. Usually most authors are deceased but she is alive and well and would have loved to hear and see her in an interview about the book.
0525953728|5.0|From the first page to the last, I was glued to this excellent narrative on life in the elite SEALS.  It offered graphic accounts of training and operational life.  I did not find any sort of classified information that could possibly be used against DEVGRU or any other elite commando units.  The only thing the author may have done is compromise the \\"silent warrior\\" oath that SEALS claim to profess.  The story of the operation killing OBL, told by a SEAL in the unit cleared up all the false media accounts.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Mr. Ryan has a gift for storytelling and Blood Song is a well-written, engaging, and intelligent fantasy.<br /><br />Enticing threads of mystery flow through the book and, unlike many other works in the genre, it is often difficult to predict what is going to happen next.<br /><br />The book is also satisfyingly large, but never drags.  Frankly it is packed with a lot of material.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Brandon Sanderson, Brent Weeks, or Patrick Rothfuss then you will find much to like in Blood Song and will want to follow this author.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
0385342039|5.0|I have kept meaning to read Sophie Kinsella's books ... and finally I started this past summer. So far, I've read 7, the latest was Twenties Girl and it such a sweet story. I'm not giving away any details (I hate that when I read reviews). I'll just say that I loved it ... in fact I just finished it now, it was a page turner, so much so that I finished the book in two days. Ms. Kinsella seems to have a way of developing characters that I fall in love with. I can't wait to read the few other books I have left on my list to read of hers, if they are anything like this one then I'm in for a treat.

B0098VYCCE|2.0|A successful fantasy requires more than special effects, action, dwarves, white horses, evil villains and pretty women. I felt like the director really wanted this to be comparable to Lord of the Rings.  It's so very much not.  Without a good screenplay, the remaining elements are merely window dressing.  This story was sloppy, flat, predictable, and tedious.  The dramatic pans, sweeping landscapes and musical score couldn't prop up what simply wasn't there.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculated the numbers are large. they have all the symbols you need for everyday math and would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for the perfect math machine on their tablet :)
B008MG1E4A|1.0|The author gets called a hero in some circles but then writes this cash grab of a book which would be ok except that it is unbelievably boring. You get to listen to Matt Bissonnette (aka Mark Owen) tell you about all his boring exploits and how he wanted to be a SEAL since he was a boy and what a snoozefest it is. The interesting Bin Laden raid details have already been disclosed in the media through Bissonnette's interviews. I'm not saying the SEAL's work is not heroic but I'm not sure Bissonnette's tell-all is in any way honorable. And that wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so boring.<br /><br />I'm very sorry I wasted money and time on this book. Do yourself a favor and read something good.

B000FBFN1U|1.0|Not worth the purchase.  Plot wanders all over and loses some of the most interesting characters.  Too many battles and too little progress in the story lines.
1451637500|4.0|The latest long-awaited episode in the Mile Vorkosigan saga takes place on a world where the business of cryo-preservation has hit the planetary economy rather oddly.<br /><br />Now one of the cryo-preservation companies wants to set up shop on Escobar, but some influential people are smelling a rat. Miles has a morbid interest in this technology for reasons that have to do with past plots and has been tasked by the Emperor to look into things.<br /><br />The story starts mise-en-scene and much is told in flashback, a style that may or may not be to one's taste. I find myself having less tolerance for it as I get older, but I didn't have much reading time to wait before everything caught up.<br /><br />I devoured the book in two days, putting off other important stuff to do so. The content is of the usual Bujold standard, pacing-wise, and assuming you like the other Miles stories this one will catch you up and sweep you along for the most part just as those others have done. I did find that some of the crucial plot resolution steps took place off stage right, being presented rather glibly as fait-accompli by secondary characters, and for that I drop a star.<br /><br />I believe there's also a rather heavy-handed metaphor buried in here, but it has been delivered years too late to be judged insightful I'm afraid.<br /><br />Not the best of these stories by any means. That honor goes in my opinion to Cetaganda.<br /><br />Still highly recommended.
B000AXWV40|4.0|I'm going to dissent from popular opinion and say the song \\"Maggot Brain\\" isn't this album's highlight. For anyone who doesn't know, it's essentially a 10-minute guitar solo played over relaxed guitar arpeggios. There's some nice playing by Eddie Hazel, who's especially good at manipulating distortion to generate these amazing growling guitar tones. However, it's all rather long, sleepy, and sparse in musical ideas, especially for an opening track. The closing song, \\"Wars of Armageddon\\" is another massive 10 minute track, a somewhat repetitive funk jam made interesting by crazy sound effects.<br /><br />To me, what's really fantastic about this album is the five tracks in the middle. The two best are \\"Can You Get To That\\" and \\"You And Your Folks\\". \\"Can You Get To That\\" is a soul song featuring a majestically laid-back guitar intro and gorgeously harmonized vocals. \\"You And Your Folks\\" has an absolutely demonic groove built on phased drums, keyboards, and catchy \\"yeah yeah yeah\\" chants. \\"Hit It And Quit It\\" and \\"Super Stupid\\" are both great straight-forward rock songs, and \\"Back In Our Minds\\" is minor track but delightfully weird.<br /><br />These five songs, spanning about 17 minutes, are certainly the torso of a five-star album. Even the first and last tracks are interesting songs and by no means bad. It's just that to me, they make it feel like Funkadelic got revved up 10 minutes late and started winding down 10 minutes early.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|Does what it's supposed to do, which helps to manage battery life. We're supposed to let batteries run down once a month or so, and now I know when that'll be best done. Very handy with Audible's books because they run the battery down faster than surfing. Keep up good work.
B007STBUIW|5.0|The new blu-ray release of Jaws is spectacular!  The extras included on the discs are informative and fun.  But the restored version of the film itself is stunning! Colors pop off the screen, everything is sharp, focused, and brilliant.  Highly recommend this blu-ray for any fan of cinema.
0756405890|5.0|If one only has time for one book, this is the book. In fact, jumping the gun slightly, make that two, \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" is a must-read as well.<br /><br />I have been reading fantasy since young. My favourite genre. Can't remember how I first stumbled on this book, but I count it a miracle. This book is simply amazing. Not to disparage other authors, but this is a standout debut work from Patrick Rothfuss which has no comparisons. Like his main protagonist, Kvothe, it goes straight to the top of the class.<br /><br />The plot is engaging and well-crafted, with both comedy and tragedy. There are the mysterious villains, the Chandrian, and the protaganist's quest to find out more about them to move on with his life. The characters are believable and fleshed out nicely. The main protaganist is an anti-hero, and supporting characters have such depth even though they play seemingly minimal parts (the book is written as a first person narrative). On top of all these outstanding elements in the book (quite common to good books), the most stupendous part is the way the entire book is written and the words used by the author; the whole book flows in such a natural way that it immerses itself into the reader's very soul. I can try to describe it by giving an analogy. The intense plot, the flavourful characters and so on are like ingredients in a good soup. What causes this soup to really taste great, however, is the special way the chef cooks it. Once one tastes a great soup, one can feel it not just down to one's stomach, but all the way down to one's marrow. And this book is this magical elixir.<br /><br />I must admit that no analogy and no reviews can give this book its due justice. Read this book even if you don't have the time. In fact, don't just even read it once. Read it thrice; read it seven times. You will never get sick of it.<br /><br />P.S. Can't wait for Day Three.
B005LAII62|4.0|beautiful movie.  THIS is how you keep stop motion alive.  unbelievable,  check out the making of video's on the official site, really awesome.<br /><br />great 'acting', lighting , really attractive character designs,  and the sets were really nice.  the art of book will be on the christmas list.<br /><br /> the homosexuality thing, i think the problem some have are that most parents want to address sexuality on their own terms and in this case it was a bit of a surprise.  if you don't want to get into that with your kids, maybe pass on it,  if you don't care, you will probably really enjoy the film.<br /><br />overall it's a fantastic product, (neil steals the show) if you're an artist, you have to see this.  it's a great artistic achievement.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Make no qualms about it. Dylan exudes confidence, charisma and the ultimate state of being. Does he care what the critic's or what you or I think.... no. Dylan does Dylan and if you don't like it he doesn't give two spits's one way or another. See Dylan live and see the badness ooze and drip from him. Mr. Sexton has come back and whipped the band into shape. You can see the band not only taking cues from Dylan but looking to Charlie as well. Charlie has an uncannily ability to take what Bob is serving up and deliver it properly.<br /><br />1, 2 star reviews, keep coming, if you don't get it that is fine with me and more importantly to Mr Zimmerman.

B007SGM084|1.0|The Trilogy is basically a porn movie wrapped in a vague manner to give the appearance of being suitable for young adults and children.

I just liked the reviews I read<br />about it and it did not disappoint!  I have a limited time to read but I put it on my Kindle and I read every available moment.  I was sad to come to the end because I felt invested in the characters.  I would recommend it to anyone who would enjoy a gripping story about a family in crisis.

1416955070|4.0|I feel like the last person in the world to have read this book! But I'm definitely glad I found it because I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />For a long time I was kind of iffy about the whole vampires and werewolves thing. I just wasn't able to get into it for some reason. I always thought it was a little farfetched, lame, and not done very well. But I think this book is really starting to change that for me. I really liked how all the mythical creatures were portrayed and everything just seemed to work really well.<br /><br />There were a lot of ideas similar to stories like Harry Potter and Star Wars that made me really enjoy City of Bones.. not in a bad \\"copied\\" kind of way, but in a really general enjoyable way. Like looking at Harry Potter, there are a lot of similarities between Death Eaters and the Circle, the whole pure blood vs mixed/half blood thing, and so on.<br /><br />The one thing I wasn't crazy about was the love triangle. In general I'm not fond of love triangles, but more than that, I just didn't feel like I ever got invested in the relationships. I didn't love Jace or Simon. In fact, sometimes I was really annoyed at both of them. Like there were times when Jace just acted like a girl throwing a tantrum or something, with the way he just ignored everything and stuck to his own interpretation. Then, at the end, he literally seemed like a brainwashed moron. Although I had my issues with him, he always seemed like such a strong and independent character, which I admired. But I felt like at the end, all of that changed and he was a bit of a pushover (though he did make a bit of a comeback).<br /><br />I definitely did love all the twists and turns. Things got super juicy towards the end when we started learning about the past and the events that occurred before, during, and after the uprising. I loved all the different `interpretations' of what happened and I loved not knowing who was telling the real story. As soon as I decided one story was true, I was eating my words.<br /><br />I'll try to avoid spoilers here, but I did feel like the story ended a bit too soon. It wasn't really a cliffhanger, but it was more like a small annoyance that made me think, \\"What? It ended?\\" Things didn't fully get wrapped up with Clary's mother, but it wasn't really huge enough to be a proper cliffhanger. It was just... annoying.<br /><br />But despite that, I definitely enjoyed City of Bones overall and I'm really looking forward to reading the next book, City of Ashes!as eating my words.<br /><br />I'll try to avoid spoilers here, but I did feel like the story ended a bit too soon.

B0079R8KO0|5.0|I've had my Marware Vibe cover for a few weeks now and I've been very happy with it.  It's sturdy, well-constructed, and attractive.  Although I don't use the case as a stand/support for my Kindle very often, I like having that as an option.  The cover protects the Kindle screen and unlike some other designs has not caused any scratches because there's no inner seam to rub against the screen.  I love the way the Kindle snaps into the case rather than relying on corner straps to hold it in, and the closure strap allows secure closure but also ease in removing it.  Initially I wanted to get a leather case but after looking at several online and reading many reviews, I opted for this case instead.  I haven't been disappointed by the appearance or the quality.
0545123275|4.0|I whipped through this book practically in one sitting! It was actually two sittings, but only because I got interrupted by mundane life necessities.. like dinner.. who needs that, anyway?<br /><br />I had a few gripes, which I'll explain in a minute, but overall I loved this book. The romance, the fantasy, the wolves, and especially the whole star-crossed lovers thing -- totally up my alley. Sam and Grace really give a whole new meaning to the term \\"summer fling.\\"<br /><br />There were definitely a lot of ways I was able to relate to the main character, Grace. The way she just feels like she belongs somewhere, her connection to nature, her obsession (that even annoys her friends a bit), and the way that she just doesn't quite fit in amongst her peers when they're criticizing the wolves or even calling for them to be killed. She's introverted, but mostly because she makes herself that way (rather than because she can't help it).<br /><br />One thing that bothered me was the lack of a \\"falling in love phase\\" for Sam and Grace. Their whole relationship moved so quickly. When I'm reading books with romance, I love reading about the `chase' and the periods of uncertainty (\\"does he like me?\\"). I feel like Shiver just jumped right into Sam and Grace already being connected, already in love, already knowing how the other person feels, and even kissing during their first real meeting. But I guess that was kind of the point. They had already spent years watching each other and that was supposed to be their `falling in love phase.' But I don't know -- it just wasn't my thing, I guess.<br /><br />But once I got over the annoyance of that, I loved their relationship. I loved that they weren't just in love -- they were best friends. They teased each other, laughed, shared secrets, and shared silence.<br /><br />Overall this was an enjoyable, quick read!  It's not the most knee-weakening romance in the world, but still a good book.
0425263908|5.0|I read Fifty Shades and loved it and was looking for something similar. Bared to You was definitely the best choice. I can't wait for the second book in the trilogy to come out in a few weeks. If you enjoyed Fifty Shades you'll love this, if you thought Fifty Shades was a little to raunchy you will like this better.Highly recommend.
0062112430|5.0|I don't know why the heck I put off reading this book as long as I did. It's been on my desk for like a month and I guess I was intimidated by the size of it (nearly 450 pages!) and the hype. I didn't want to be disappointed. Well I'm super happy to say that I wasn't! This book is totally worth the hype!<br /><br />When the story starts out, Lena is basically one of society's clones. She believes love--the deliria-- is a disease. She can't wait to get the cure. She's excited and eager. She believes that the government and random house raids are all there for her protection. She's totally wrong.<br /><br />Normally I get frustrated when there's a naive \\"buy into what society tells you\\" kind of girl in a book. While I didn't love it in Delirium, at least I understood it. Lena didn't know any better. She grew up being taught that love is a horrible life-ruining thing that needs to be cured. I couldn't really blame her for believing what she was taught. And she does slowly start to come out of her shell and actually see the real world around her, and start dipping her toes into the world of love!<br /><br />I loved how even though Delirium is a futuristic dystopian book, there were so many parts that felt exactly like life today. I mean they still had school, graduation, sleepovers, and other than the whole deliria thing society felt pretty similar. I could totally relate to Lena and her best friend. They did everything together and supported each other, but there were also times when they started finding differences between themselves and drifting apart. It felt like a very realistic relationship!<br /><br />And ohmygod the romance. OH MY GOD! It's forbidden, it's awesome, it's sexy, there's kissing, and then there's more kissing, and late-night-beach outings, and oh my god THE KISSING!!!! I absolutely loved Alex and Lena. Their relationship was so pure and so... I don't know. SQUEE!! I like how there were no stupid petty arguments. At one point I thought I saw one coming on, but I was pleasantly surprised to see it not turn into an argument at all. I hate it in books when the girl is doing something with a different guy that looks bad from the outside, but really there's a perfectly reasonable explanation. But then the other main male just gets pissed off and doesn't listen to her explanation so it all gets blown out of proportion and it's just stupid and petty. There was none of that in Delirium! Alex was totally reasonable and understanding and awesome! And I loved how he was always open, honest, and patient with Lena. Their relationship was just so yummy!!!<br /><br />I enjoyed the first 350 pages, but it was really the last 100 that had me screaming for absolute joy and loving this book with every fiber of my being! Towards the end things get totally intensified!  You will not be able to put the book down!<br /><br />I loved how I was never able to guess the ending. There were so many endings that would have made sense that I could never pinpoint what it was going to be. Would Lena get the cure but somehow be resistent to it like her mom was? Would Lena try to take down the government? Would she run away? Would she go into hiding? And how would Alex tie in? Would the ending be happy or sad? I had no idea! And I loved how there were a few things that hit me out of nowhere. Maybe in hindsight they totally make sense and might even be kind of obvious, but in the moment I totally didn't even consider them so it was full of surprises!ing on, but I was pleasantly surprised to see it not turn into an argument at all.

Their relationship was just so yummy!!!<br /><br />I enjoyed the first 350 pages, but it was really the last 100 that had me screaming for absolute joy and loving this book with every fiber of my being! Towards the end things get totally intensified!  You will not be able to put the book down!<br /><br />I loved how I was never able to guess the ending. There were so many endings that would have made sense that I could never pinpoint what it was going to be. Would Lena get the cure but somehow be resistent to it like her mom was? Would Lena try to take down the government? Would she run away? Would she go into hiding? And how would Alex tie in? Would the ending be happy or sad? I had no idea! And I loved how there were a few things that hit me out of nowhere. Maybe in hindsight they totally make sense and might even be kind of obvious, but in the moment I totally didn't even consider them so it was full of surprises!

B004P1JEWU|5.0|Another brilliant book in George R.R. Martin's hugely entertaining and successful A Song of Ice & Fire saga.<br />I had avoided the fantasy genre for many years, after overdosing on Marion Zimmer Bradly when a teen and not wanting to repeat the experience.<br />For me, this is on a par with Tolkien's Lord of the Ring saga or maybe even better.

B005KELQEU|5.0|My son bought me a Nextbook (must be an off brand) at a discount store, were things that are out dated go to get sold. It got me hooked with all the apps you can get, but it must have been an older model because I had all kinds of trouble with it, so I decided to buy another device. What to buy, The Kindle Fire I was told to stay away from, the Samsung was good or Google Nexus 7 was the best, with its quad core? I bought the Samsung and had more problems with it, not that it was bad but it had all these features and apps that you have to log in and create accounts to operate everything on it. It drove me crazy. I returned it and bought the Kindle. I found out I didn't need something that does 100 things like a smart phone or IPad. I don't need to watch tv, stream viedos, down load music, tweet, surf the net play games or face book and many other functions. I just need something simple and easy to read my books. So I bought the Kindle, can't get any better than this. Create and Amazon account (very simple), put a couple gift cards in it (so you don't have to worry about your credit card) and shop for books. Hit the one stop shop button and it down loads via your internet router in seconds. Can't say enough, the quality is great, the cost is inexpensive, stores tons of books, should I keep going? If you want something without a lot of bells and whistles buy a kindle. Besides, after reading a book I have a life to get back too, and it dosen't involve a device in my hand 24/7. The kindle is great for what its made for, can't say any more than that. I got carried away about the kindle. I purchase the Belkin case after going to ever store that sells covers. $40, $50 and more for a case, really? I bought nthe Belkinh from Amazon.com. inexpensive and very nice. Hard to explain it's make up but for whats out there and the cost, you can't go wrong.<br />I didn't need a device with bells and whistles, just something nice and simple. Then a nice simple cover to protect the reader.
B005J4TLN4|3.0|There's going to be some comparisons to \\"E.T.\\" (small aliens in an urban setting with kids riding bikes) that make some sense at one level but the comparisons will be greatly misleading.  This \\"R\\" rated alien infestation (it has a very small and temporal scope so \\"invasion\\" doesn't quite fit) flick makes use of some striking visuals (pitch black man-apes with big mouths that glow like neon blue Colgate toothpaste) and is a slice of modern life around an upscale tenement housing project (nicknamed \\"the block\\") that focuses on a group of young hoodlums with (to our American ears) thick British accents that are hard to decipher much of the time.  The main characters, the young thugs, aren't endearing at all; practically no one in the movie is with the exception of the sympathetic nurse that gets robbed by them early on and then needs to stick with them to stay alive.  Quirky but fairly one-dimensional characters abound and by movies end life goes on as usual so it feels like nothing terribly significant has happened.  You'll probably have some fun along the way but just know that this is mainly \\"R\\" for the rampant F-bombs dropped by the terrible teens and it doesn't come close to having the heart of \\"E.T.\\".  I would suggest it as a cheap rental only.

B004ZJZQBK|4.0|Reasons to see this movie?<br /><br />Morgan Freeman delivering obfuscating speeches to James McAvoy to get him to off someone who is not whom McAvoy thinks he is.  (See there?  I obfuscated a bit myself!)<br />Angelina Jolie showing off some slick assassin moves.<br />Bending bullets (the shot trajectories actually).<br />Slick slo-mo sick and bloody violence.<br />The transformation of a flacid boy into a take-charge avenger.<br />A great bag of extras including: motion comics from the original \\"Wanted\\" series; visual effects execution scenes; assassin profiles; more.<br />An edgy, well-developed storyline that though it's mostly a \\"been there, done that\\" thing it does it with style!
1451696191|4.0|What am I supposed to say about this book? It's classic, it's obviously great, and lots of people who are far more eloquent than I am have reviewed it far better than I ever will. That said, a few of my thoughts...<br /><br />1. I liked how it was written in letters, even though it was mostly stream of conscious the writing was still lively and dynamic. However, I did think the simple sentence structure and general naivety were a bit too young for a 15 year-old and then 16 year-old character who is apparently extremely intelligent.<br /><br />2. It's a personal preference, but I like books where there's a problem or issue or mystery or just thing that's happening and is ultimately resolved. This is just a year in Charlie's life, which I found to be interesting, but I tend to prefer a book has a mission, so to speak.<br /><br />3. No spoilers, but I couldn't believe how this big thing was just revealed at the end and then the book pretty much ended. I had to go back and re-read it a few times to make sure that's really what I had read.<br /><br />Those are my few thoughts. I definitely think if you're a fan of YA literature this is a must read.

Over And Over, Farmer John, Mansion On The Hill, not too much here is filler. In context, with the era in which this album was released, it's safe to say this hasn't aged at all while 99% of the stuff that was  popular back in 1990 sounds so dated now.
B001L62REY|5.0|The Last of the Mohicans is one of my top 5 all time favorites.  The opening scene is a hunting chase through the forest that immediately draws you into the 1700's where the story was set.  This is a fast paced romantic/action story that ends in a climatic cliff-top battle.  The mountain scenery is spectacular.  Daniel Day Lewis leads a superb cast in what I felt was director Michael Mann's best film.<br /><br />-Bill Baggett
B001CTDH76|5.0|This is one of my favourite shows of the last couple of years. Love the show, love the characters, love the mix of humour and dark. Some shows take a while to get their feet. This one came out of the gates with everyone fully realized and in character. If you haven't, watch it.
B004LP3AYI|2.0|This has been one of my favorite epic stories since I first began to love reading. Terry Goodkind masterfully makes his characters as real to the reader as if he were speaking with them. It is impossibly easy to become invested in their every success and cry for them when they suffer. Also, the settings are beautifully depicted.<br /><br />The problem here is that when this book went from print to this Kindle version, no one seemed to notice all the typos. And I don't just mean one or two, that anyone can ignore in good grace.<br /><br />I cannot believe this has been made available to purchase. \\"Than\\" is without fail ALWAYS spelled as \\"that\\" and I don't know if you know this, but it makes a big difference in the meaning of a sentence when that is mispelled. Like I said, once or twice? No big deal. Once you are used to it, it just becomes incredibly irritating. Not to mention frequent mispellings of many other wrods (like that) and blatant ommisions of words that are rather important for context. Or putting the one more \\"the\\" in the sentence that necessary.<br /><br />Conclusion? Read it--absolutely! If you liked Wizard's First Rule, you are bound to like this sequel. But for the sake of your enjoyment, buy a secondhand paperback instead. Don't waste your valuable money on this. On the other hand, if you have prime and can borrow it for free, why worry?
0393338827|5.0|The Big Short is proof that we never learn our lessons, particularly where money is concerned. As he did with Liar's Poker, Michael Lewis takes us inside the financial industry and lays out how we ended up in the mess we're still facing.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I usually go into DC movie translations with the little to no expectations of matching their source material. That being said, if you never read Dark Knight Returns, you may be fortunate enough to enjoy this movie as much as I did. It was much better than most of their offerings, and I feel as though the average joe and new fans alike will enjoy another telling of The Batman, even if it's only to hold them over until they can buy the live action movie from the Nolanverse.<br /><br />In short: I think they set a nice tone throughout, the voice acting is solid, and the soundtrack has a nice edge that helps to add tension to the movie.<br /><br />Anyway, Bats is old. It's several years into the future and a gang of mutants have taken over the city. After much thought and several nightmares, Bruce Wayne decides to put the cowl back on, and go after these criminals. He takes a side step to handle a plastic surgery \\"fixed\\" Harvey Dent then takes on the mutants leader one on one. He also awakens an old nemesis in the process and sets the movie up for its sequel. I know die hard's will probably shrug their shoulders and turn up their noses to this, but I for one am more than happy getting as much Batman as I can. But like I said, I think the average and newer fans will enjoy this just as much as a junkie like me.

What I got was a gripping, revealing, sometimes heart-rending memoir that was so enthralling,i read it in one sitting.  What comes across strikingly is that Seal Team 6 members believe in the USA and will do whatever is required to ensure the security of this country.  Impressive, humbling, and unforgettable.

B002ZG980U|2.0|I couldn't finish this. I was overwhelmed by the tedium, the constant shifting back and forth between reality and dream. After awhile, I no longer cared who was dreaming and who wasn't. The old dream within a dream is a dreadful cliche, a staple of old TV shows like the \\"Twilight Zone.\\" The plot, some mumbo-jumbo about a corporate takeover, gets lost amid the CGI and the constantly throbbing and annoying soundtrack. This is one of Leo DiCaprio's lesser efforts. The script is weak and the acting is nothing special. It's all special effects, and the tale is one you won't want to remember. Skip without fear.

B000L43QJ2|5.0|This is a fascinating rendition of Swan Lake.  The corps was very impressive.  I am a big fan of Letestu even in this role.  Others have said that they found her too cold.  I thought her performance was very moving and as Odette she brought out the pathos and sorrow of her plight.  This emphasis fits Nureyev's story because in the end she does not end dying with Sigfried.  Her Odile was quite manipulative and evil, sometimes even sassy.  Overall, I would recommend wholeheartedly.  It is a very solid presentation of Swan Lake.

0307577589|4.0|The novel's main plot is fairly straight forward: a recently shamed political/ financial reporter (Mikael Blomkvist) is hired by the elderly head of the Vanger family (a billionaire industrialist family) to investigate the disappearance and possible murder of his niece 36 years ago. The circumstances surrounding the disappearance is presented as a \\"locked room\\" mystery - meaning that the environment in which the incident happened was closed to the outside world, limiting the suspects to only a few people.<br /><br />Surrounding main plot line is another one concerning the novel's namesake, Lisbeth Salanders. This gal is a social misfit who works as a security consult / private investigator while hiding a life of troubles. Larsson starts off by introducing and developing both players (Mikael and Lisbeth) and plot lines separately before intertwining them into one overarching story.<br /><br />Not wanting to give away too much details, I am going to shift gears here and briefly mention some of the more impactful concepts Larsson deals with in the novel. Earlier I mention that the book deals with acts of violence against women, and that is certainly true. A lot of the material in the book deals with this topic and how people deal with this violence - both men and women.<br /><br />One of the characters, for example, deals with this violence by taking revenge in their hands and dealing out violence in return. Part of this eye-for-an-eye mentally mostly likely comes from Larsson's own childhood when he witnessed a gang rape of a young lady and was powerless to do anything. As such, I can see why some of his characters seek this revenge - both for themselves and for others. Yet, on the other hand, I, as a follower of Jesus, can't help but remember the words of my King who says that revenge is His (Romans 12:19).  Violence begets violence; lack of trust begets lack of trust - a fact that in some ways is bore out in this book (abet subtly as this is not a theme of the book...it more of an observation on the essence of the characters)<br /><br />Another theme that Larsson does explore is one of ethics. What do you do if you are confronted with two evils and not good solutions? How do you choose a way forward in life when in doing so will cause pain at some level? Yet, a decision as to be made and, yes, the lack of a decision is still a decision....<br /><br />Larsson also does a great job at exploring the lives of those who are living under society's radar. Those folks whom society has deemed unfit or worse... How do they live? What are their motivations, pains, happiness, etc.?<br /><br />In a lot of ways this last theme was one of the hardest for me as my heart broke for those who had no one to trust...they were quite literally all alone in a sea of humanity. They don't even trust the official authorities that we in middle class USA take for granted (i.e. the police, justice system, etc.)...  Folks who are supposed to take care of them don't; instead they abuse their power and rape them (literally and figuratively) for their own pleasure.<br /><br />In ending, \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" by Stieg Larsson is a powerful book that keeps you engaged and has an amazing twist at the end. However, it is also a very intense and emotional book that may not be for everyone. In fact some of you will most likely throw the book across the table as Larsson does not retreat for descriptive vocabulary at the pains experienced by women every second across the planet.<br /><br />Yeah...it is not a `light' read. But it does bring up things, real life things, that are worth thinking about...it more of an observation on the essence of the characters)<br /><br />Another theme that Larsson does explore is one of ethics.

Normally I am very satisfied at the end, even when the dreaded villian shows he will return some day.  However, The Long Walk is much like Cell in that you are waiting for the conclusion or ENDING and it just doesn't come.  To say that both these books leave you wanting more is a HUGE understatement.  It makes you angry you ever started reading it.  I felt jipped.  I have many other books I could have spent my time on rather than one that was such a disappointment.<br />Don't give up on SK because of a few duds.  He is a mastermind and has MANY really awesome books!!!

A few customers will do the same. You always have to look at both the message and the details to get the facts and truth. There are minor mistakes and researchers, editors and publishers are not all perfect. We all wish they would try harder. I had one bad experience and one good with my latest book. Anyhow this is an extremely honorable American warrior and citizen who served our country in a position most cannot imagine. Both books were excellent reads that provided true insight.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|This was a fantastic book. I am currently teaching 8th Grade and I look forward to hearing my students reactions to the book. I would not recommend this book for students under 13 y/o however due to some sensitive content that is contained in the text. Most of the book could be considered PG-13 although once you get toward the end there are a couple of chapters that do contain come racier material. This book was a definite page turner addressing some very important issues when it comes to bullying and the consequences that can result from it. I feel that most teens will be able to relate to this book on one level or another since it does touch on so many different issues that they will face as they go through high school.

The Boys have done it again, these B sides are no different. \\"A Certain 'Je ne sais quoi' should/could have been on the album (Elysium) for all the fans crying the album is too slow.  It's classic DISCO PSB energy still going strong.  \\"The Way Through The Woods\\" sounds like it could be INTROSPECTIVE era.  \\"I Started A Joke\\" is an already great Gibb classic from our past, this one done in PSB style, maybe even more haunting than the original, not better but haunting.

B0098VYCCE|2.0|I just want to start off by saying that I wanted to like this movie. I really did. However, this film is depressingly skin deep.<br /><br />The good. The camerawork is absolutely stunning, the special effects as well. Your eyes tell you that there is a marvelous film before you, but that is as far as it goes. I have to say, before I start the bashing, that Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth try their absolute hardest making something out of the lines that they are given. Their performances were touching (Theron more so than the rest) and they at least gave some substance to it.  Hemsworth carried most of the film when Theron wasn't in the picture. If it were just a story between the two of them, even with the horrible lines that they were given, it would have been at least a four star film.<br /><br />Now for the bad, and when I say bad, I mean terrible. I never had much of an opinion about Kristen Stewart before this movie. I steadfastly stayed away from Twilight so I thought I had a pretty clean slate to judge going into this. Stewart, who plays Snow White, has been locked in a tower for years only to escape right before the Queen (Theron), who killed her father the King, kills her and takes her heart. Needless to say, after somehow finding this out in a slightly perverted scene, Snow White runs away. Then she runs away again after she loses her magic pony (actually, she abandons him). Then the Huntsman joins in and he runs away with her too. At some point there's a Troll for all of 30 seconds, then scarred women for another minute or so. At about the 1 hour mark we finally meet the dwarves.  Throughout all of this, we maybe get 10 mumbled lines from Stewart. I can't say that this is entirely her fault. It is the writing that is terrible. But then we get to the acting. I swear, every single time Hemsworth spoke to Stewart you could see the pleading in his eyes. It's as if he were trying to say, \\"Please, give me some sort of emotion to go on!!\\" Alas, Stewart juststares back at him and breathes. Literally.  This is the Snow White we get. A breathing, slightly constipated looking girl who squints off into the distance looking slightly befuddled.  You can almost tell that the director is obsessed with Stewart from all of the closeups you get of her. I mean after about the 20th time I get it. She's beautiful. Now show me something MORE. I mean, Snow White, you were LOCKED AWAY in a TOWER for YEARS after witnessing the DEATH of your FATHER and the FALL of your KINGDOM. Any human being would have had some sort of melt down, but all we get is Stewart, looking beautiful.  Hasn't anyone told these people that looks can only get you so far?<br /><br />It was the wooden lead that sealed it for me. No matter how good the surrounding cast, you need a great lead to carry such a heavy weight of a film. Oh, and let's not forget to mention the patch work editing and dead dialogue that made it even worse. I was literally writhing in pain and hitting my forehead with my fist by the time it ended. Truly, it was pure agony to sit through for anyone who likes backstory and acting.<br /><br />If you want to watch a visually stunning film, this is the movie for you. Before you go watch it though, I strongly suggest that you just mute out the scenes with Stewart, which is most of the film. After all, wasn't it only visual beauty that the director was trying to portray?<br /><br />The fairest of them all truly is only skin deep.

0425263908|4.0|I don't want to bash this book or the other very popular one. The books are similar but the Authors writing style and details are not. The sex that Gid and Eva have are so much better than 50..... Their love for each other is confusing and crazy just like 50. I though about the characters when I was washing the dishes or on my way to work. That says a lot in my book.<br /><br />I really like Bared to You and pre-ordered her follow up. She deserves respect for writing this book. It flowed well.<br /><br />B&N places her book right next to 50 and when I asked Customer Service what should I read after 50 she pointed to Bared to You.

B004PVKFR8|5.0|There is nothing bad to say about AWOLNATION. This album is amazing. An edgy and melodious creation that produces what mainstream music has been lacking for years. I have seen some comments referencing the random tidbits that are included on the album, such as track two 'Some sort of creature'. I really think these tidbits reflect on the fact that AWOLNATION understands their fan base who want something personal from this band. The group definitely gives that personal touch on the album. I can feel the emotion coming from each song, and am left feeling AWOLNATION in my blood. I saw them in concert recently and it was more than I could ever have imagined.

B006AZZPCM|1.0|I got this app a long time ago, but I deleted it due to porn ads. I got it again and saw it had got rid of the ads. I was very pleased with that and the performance of the app, but now it won't download or even play a video! Until it gets fixed I have to rate it one star.
B005FISBTO|3.0|Got this product from Amazon within 2 days of ordering.  Great season, lots of twists and turns as always.  Such a wonderful show I would almost sign up for Showtime, but if I manage to stay away from spoilers I can wait until latest season comes out on DVD.
B0088TG252|4.0|Great acting and enjoyable action sequences without going over the top with the violence. However, there at times that it seems to drag between the excitement. No special surprises by time you get to the end of the movie as you feel like it gets to exactly where it was playing up to the entire time.  Still, an enjoyable rent but not 5 star worthy.

0375703861|1.0|I got this book because I liked Zadie Smith's On Beauty. I was excited to read all the gushing blurbs at the back of the book. I started reading the book with earnest enthusiasm but sadly, not even that is enough to get me through all 542 pages. I gave up by page 250. I have no desire whatsoever to know what happened to any of the characters. Smith's writing was difficult to read. I couldn't get into the story or the characters and it felt like she was dragging her feet with her writing. The narrative was not one tiny bit compelling. I'm so disappointed with this book.

1401207529|5.0|Frank Miller re-imagines Batman's origin in this book so well, DC decided to recognize it as official canon. That of course means this is now Batman's definitive origin. A great thing about this is that Miller focuses a lot more on the importance of the story. I love Dark Knight Returns but he often focuses on adding extra grit and portrays Batman as a sadist and more of an anti-Hero than a hero. This is great for DKR, as an Elseworlds story and answering the question: What if Batman retired? In Year One however, we want to see how a young boy born into enormous wealth becomes a man of virtue seeking to bring Justice to a corrupt and crime addled metropolis (not to be confused with Metropolis). Miller gives us just that. People knock the art style, and some call it dated. Well first this was done 24 years ago. Second, this simple art is just what we need. Batman is not supposed to have some fancy well-detailed costume. He doesn't even know he'll become Batman precisely until the end of the first chapter. Billionaire yes, but these are his sort of humble beginnings, as you can see when reading this book, he also doesn't happen to take down 20 men without taking a scratch. He engages in full on brawls and sometimes he barely makes it out. It's precisely that dynamic that sets this book apart and makes it great.
B008AWBQGW|4.0|Seem's like an OK effort not far removed from the previous release, God N Gun's, similar guitar rifs, predicable lyrics, still down home rockin after all these years is impressive no matter what. Overall I still turn it up, roll down the windows and try to introduce the youth at the traffic lights what good music sounds like. Keep on goin LS.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I didn't even want to see this film because a. I'm not a country fan b. I'm not a Johnny Cash fan and c. I don't usually enjoy films about married people who cheat on their spouses( i.e. Bridges of Madison County).  All I can say after seeing this extraordinary film, is thank God I did!  It's a remarkable love story about flawed but totally likable individuals. Joaquin Phoenix is a revelation in this film. He IS the man in black and he's so raw and vulnerable that it's as if Johnny Cash was reborn in him. Why he didn't get an Oscar for this performance is beyond me. It's not just a good film; it's in my top 10 of all time.
0802798225|3.0|Perfect Chemistry by Simone Elkeles, was a real mixed bag for me. It has great reviews all over the place, the ever popular young adult romance characters-two beautiful people from different sides of the tracts bridging the gap of teenage social cliques who in the end really \\"get each\\" even though no one understands, all in a modern day setting we can supposedly relate to. But, I fluctuated between being skeptical and captivated through out the entire book. There was just something missing for me as I read, making this book fall short of great. Don't get me wrong, it was a fun read and I am most defiantly interested in the next two in the series-they are just not on the top of my TBR pile. Somewhere around the middle the writing got a little \\"eye-rolly\\" and the end was way over the top even for me. I mean, I love my YA romance novels smothered in cheese-but yeesh-it could have been toned down a notch so it wasn't literally dripping off of the pages.<br /><br />I really did like the main characters and enjoyed their backstory explaining why they are who they are AND I felt the side characters helped to add to the realism of the teen social world. The writing didn't totally miss the mark.  I felt the nervousness, anxiety, comedy, awkwardness and joy in most of the scenes and (of course as you already know if you have read any of my previous reviews) I love the character perspective switch when telling a story.  All in all, I liked, I just didn't love it.

Whether you're a barrister, solicitor, accountant or company secretary, or in any way professionally involved in the taxation process you will need the latest edition of this familiar, authoritative and ever-reliable two-volume work of reference, especially as this new edition contains a significant amount of new material.  Also note that it is endorsed by The Chartered Institute of Taxation!<br /><br />This edition incorporates all relevant provisions of the current Finance Act (passed on 17 July 2012) reproduced in full and it therefore contains texts as they applied at July 2012, with coverage of value added tax, stamp taxes, insurance premium tax, landfill tax, aggregates levy and climate change levy.<br /><br />The text of the legislation is set out as it applies for the current tax year.  Any amendments stated to come into effect on a specified date after the end of that year are not included. For other key areas of taxation, including income tax, NI contributions and so forth, you'll need to refer to this Handbook's companion volume, the Yellow Tax Handbook, also from Tolley's.<br /><br />Bearing in mind that this is a massive and meticulously detailed, work, it is nonetheless relatively easy for the practitioner to look things up.  Each of the taxes covered are arranged in separate sections, with each section arranged in the same order, namely:  UK statutes... statutory instruments...  EC legislation for VAT...  extra statutory concessions... statements of practice... and VAT Notices with the force of law, as well as selected press releases (published by HMRC and extracts from Hansard).<br /><br />There's an Index of Words and Phrases at the end of each section and another useful feature as you're pouring through the text, is the item reference printed in bold type in the outside top corner of each page.  Also very useful indeed is the almost 50-page VAT Index at the back of Volume I which is an interesting read in itself.  There are newsletter articles as well.<br /><br />Together with its companion Yellow Tax Handbook 2012-13, this edition of Tolley's Orange Tax Handbook 2012-13 is exactly what you as a tax specialist need in your library.<br /><br />The publication date is cited as at July 2012.  Note further that expert commentary on the legislation covered in the Orange Tax Handbook is provided in the Moore Stephens Orange Tax Guide 2012-13, also available from LexisNexis.br />There's an Index of Words and Phrases at the end of each section and another useful feature as you're pouring through the text, is the item reference printed in bold type in the outside top corner of each page.

B006LSZECO|2.0|This book opened with details that lead the reader to a real page turner.  The author's use of description had a very contemporary and realistic feel. Unfortunately, like so many books these days, the author had to wrap it up somewhere and seemed anxious to do so by just letting the characters go wacko.
0199751110|5.0|PROTECTING IP RIGHTS STATESIDE WITH RESPECT TO GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Fundamentally, it's innovation which keeps markets and economies moving. Britain and America, especially America are the prime examples of that! As the four expert authors of this insightful book, now in a second edition, point out: `cutting edge technology is a driving force behind America's sustained economic growth;' despite cyclical or systemic fluctuations in that nation's economic health, we would venture to add.<br /><br />Enter the almost symbiotic relationship between the public and private sectors in the United States discussed in detail in this book on intellectual property rights.  From 2006, for example, the US Government was and no doubt still is `the world's largest consumer of goods and services; the aggregate spending of the 50 States not far behind.'<br /><br />If one could simplify this ongoing private-public sector relationship, it would be to point out that the US Government has a continuing need for the research, the technologies and the products and services initiated and produced by the private sector. The authors cite the DoD (Department of Defense), the Department of Energy (DoE) and NASA as examples of research-intensive government agencies which in their words, `have started to rely on the private sector to provide the latest and greatest available technologies.'<br /><br />All this of course impacts on procurement process in general and on government contracts in particular.  The book, therefore, as the publishers have put it, has embarked on `a comprehensive appraisal of the intellectual property implications of state and federal procurement programs in the United States'<br /><br />Now in a new second edition from OUP, the book provides a wealth of updated examination and analysis of the rules and strategies for handling government use of private sector IP rights - and sometimes their misuse. New developments that have emerged over the last three years (since the first edition was published) are included.<br /><br />Yes, the book is American, but the issues and problems it raises in the arena of protecting and enforcing clients' intellectual property rights are applicable globally, particularly to mixed economies like that of the UK.<br /><br />More or less half the book concentrates on issues relating to federal procurement practices and the like.  The latter half, in a lengthy and final chapter, deals individually with each on the 50 states in turn, from Alabama and Alaska to Virginia, Washington and the District of Columbia, covering such areas as intellectual property laws, procurement laws, technology transfer and sovereign immunity waivers.<br /><br />With some 20 pages of cases and a detailed index at the back, this copiously footnoted work of scholarship should be required reading for American IP lawyers, not to mention UK practitioners.<br /><br />And it is for all advisers requiring not only solid information and informed commentary, but a transatlantic perspective on those intellectual property issues which straddle the public and private sectors.

1451627297|3.0|I love Stephen King, and anything he writes, with a few notable exceptions, is worth reading. I found parts of this book to have that old Stephen King juice, but other parts to have a sodden, lacking feel to them. The time travel part most of all, which is a problem for a book about time travel.<br /><br />It seems inconceivable to me that after discussing the butterfly effect, that anyone would think saving JFK from assassination would make the world a better place. That certain things would follow after other certain things. That is a naive view of history and human nature.<br /><br />I won't give away more of the plot, but I will say I had a nice emotional punch at the end, which shows the master can still work magic. I just think there is less of it here.

0061914177|3.0|I heard many good things about Gary Vaynerchuk and when I did finally get my hands on Crush It I was looking forward to learning more about how Gary built his empire.<br /><br />Gary has put together a book with advice that sounds great from a stage but is hardly something you would want to put into action.<br /><br />Including, \\"What kind of business did you plan on starting, a mediocre one or one that's kick-ass? You know the answer.\\"<br /><br />Or, \\"It's never a bad time to start a business unless you are starting a mediocre business\\"<br /><br />Or this recommendation, \\"Do what makes you happy, keep it simple, do the research, work hard, look ahead.\\"<br /><br />Gary tells us how he got his start in business selling baseball cards and realized that he had chosen the wrong cards to get his business started. So he \\"adjusted, repricing every card...for less than anyone else was selling them.\\" Gary says that he learned one of his first lessons in business---scarcity breeds desire. Unfortunately the law of scarcity is when something wanted is in limited availability, not a cheap price. Maybe Gary meant the Least Cost Rule of Economics, all things being equal and actors rational, the actor will chose the lowest cost.<br /><br />The best advice Gary gave was, \\"My secret to success is just one guy's way of doing things...but don't do things my way\\" I agree.<br /><br />Clearly I am not the target audience for this book<br /><br />I am not questioning Gary's success or his ability to give exciting and motivational speeches, he is very engaging. However, I am not sure this book is anything more than a motivational speech and personally I would rather hear Gary speak than have read the book.
B007TR1R1I|3.0|Rachel Weisz gives one of her best performances as the emotionally desperate Hester Collyer.  The film has an unusual look to it, shot mostly in low light situations.  Attesting to the director's (Terence Davies) goal of giving it a feeling of memories of earlier events.  To me it looked artificial and fuzzy on my display.<br /><br />The story can pretty much be summed up in a line from Hester's lover Freddie Page (Tom Hiddleston).  During an argument, he tells her something to the effect, \\"you married the first man you met and fell in love with the first man that flirted with you.\\"  He was referring to himself in the second case.  Hester, a beautiful, properly raised woman of strict upbringing does marry an older unattractive and mother-dominated judge (Simon Russell Beale).  She has wealth, privilege, prestige and a title.  But she hates the mother who sneers at her and she never loved Sir William.<br /><br />She meets a decorated R.A.F. pilot who fawns, flirts and well...shows her a physical attention she never experienced before.  Hester loves him passionately and wants a divorce.  Freddie loves her too.  Well at least when it's convenient.  He likes to flirt, remember?  He likes to pub crawl and he likes his freedom.  Even when Sir William refuses to divorce, Hester moves in with Freddie.  It's a struggle for both, leading to Hester's wish to die.  Weisz gives a full range of emotion as a naïve, inexperienced woman who strives for the full pleasure of love.  Alas, the film is about as dull as Sir William.<br /><br />As noted earlier the film has a hazy look throughout using washed out tints of brown most often.  The transfer is in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is a fine DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 that mixes well including numerous songs of the era and some classical works.  No complaints there.
B008RV5K5E|3.0|Ok so this is the plot and story line of TDKR, but it does not have the power of the graphic novel. I recall reading TDKR in the 80s and it redefined Batman, telling a story that is both political and fantastical. By talking away the inner monologue, we do not get inside the old man that Bruce has become, nor do we feel the menacing on coming storm that the mutants are.<br /><br />Miller pushed the Batman myth and it was almost as if Batman pushed back, not wanting to become the character Miller was creating and between this push we got to read a remarkable story.<br /><br />And here is where the animated version falls flat, we must not push beyond what DC/Warner are doing with Batman now. So we get a watered down version of TDKR. I cannot wait to see how the SM moment of Cat Women dress as Wonder Women bound up by the Joker plays out.
B0002HYC8C|5.0|I bought this more for myself than for my three children! I've been eying it up for awhile, especially since it has been discontinued. I'm glad that I did purchase it. It's a lovely large size and was easier to put together than I expected. The top part of the boat does come off, but it's still sturdy and doesn't fall to pieces.<br /><br />My 7 year old and 4 year old enjoy playing with the ark. Even my 1 year old reaches for it and grabs at the animals. (He has the 123 version, but I think he likes this one better!) My kids would have enjoyed some Bible times children to go on the ark - which I know isn't Biblically accurate, but they still would have enjoyed it. Instead they added a couple of other Playmobil kids to the family. My kids also don't like the giraffes, as they don't fit as easily as the other animals do! We tested it in the bath tub and it does float nicely. My son's favourite part was the pulley - but then he lost the hook & rope.<br /><br />Overall, another great product from the Playmobil line.
B006JSXYPA|3.0|Read so many reviews about how funderful the 3DBR was and had to make a purchase. Ran home like Charlie from Willy Wonka with the golden ticket. Ploppled in the disc and after having seen the menu, just knew it had been a good buy. After having watched it at least 3 times on a 51'inch 3D tele (not bragging, just want to give folks an idea of what the movie was shown on) must say that it was \\"just okay.\\" Yes there are 3D scenes but nothing more than watching a 2D conversion of Sleepy Hollow w/JDepp DVD. There weren't any wow moments. Overall IMO it was \\"just okay.\\" Watched Titanic 3D several times this week and to me, is what 3D should be. of course your entertainment value my vary...

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I have been a great fan of the Jack Reacher novels over the years. They have always been dependably good reads, although they had become a bit formulaic. Lee Child has tried to vary his successful formula for Reacher here, but sadly hasn't nailed it. I found the dialogue to be quite unambitious and the characterisation simplistic. Found it a bit silly, for example, how Jack's relationship with the FBI agent, Sorenson develops.<br />Sorry, just lacked credibility on many levels for me, and I had been looking forward to this new book coming out. Disappointed!

B000002IKR|5.0|Legacy is an awesome metal album and less polished than their later discography. They start off great as a new band and I think it's better than the debuts of most thrash metal bands. Lots of great songwriting, even though I find part of the lyrics dated. Chuck Billy is a talented singer and has a good vocal range, does some great screaming throughout but can also sing well. Drumming is good and very fast-paced, along with audible bass. Guitar riffs and solos are excellent, some of the best guitar in thrash metal. However, I don't think it's the best offering from Testament since the band grew and matured a lot on their next 2 releases. Legacy is still one of their top 5 best though and is essential to Testament fans or anyone that likes metal in general. My standout tracks are The Haunting, Over The Wall, First Strike Is Deadly and Apocalyptic City.

B0013WJGJ0|5.0|1989 film is easily the best Batman film of all time and one of my favorite movies. Michael Keaton was the best Batman and Jack Nicholson does an excellent role as The Joker. Heath Ledger did just as good of a role, maybe even better but I prefer the direction of Nicholson. He did a good job as being a villain but still being crazy and having a sense of humor. Also Tim Burton did a great job directing and producing it. The genre and atmosphere was influenced a lot by him. The campiness of the '60s film and series is gone and there's a much darker edge to it. It's almost a prequel about Batman and The Joker, it starts with Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) as a child witnessing his parents killed by a criminal. He vows to avenge their deaths in a lifelong battle against crime while concealing his secret identity. Later on in the film it shows the origin of The Joker. Jack Napier is sent to raid the Axis Chemicals factory. Batman arrives and takes out Napier's henchmen. Napier shoots at Batman, who deflects the bullet with his metal-reinforced gauntlet and sends it back in Napier's face. Napier falls into a vat of chemicals which almost killed him but just disfigured his face and eventually becomes The Joker.

B000002P6R|5.0|Face Dances is one of the most underrated albums in music. I'm a big fan of The Who throughout their '60s and '70s discography but they didn't go downhill one bit in the '80s. However they did change direction a bit and it was after their drummer Keith Moon died in 1978 and was replaced by Kenny Jones. Face Dances is a bit different and it has more '80s new wave in it, rather than just rock. Sure it's not as good as their classics such as Tommy, Who's Next, Quarophenia and Who Are You but that doesn't mean it's a bad album. It includes their '81 hit \\"You Better You Bet\\" and lots of other underrated gems. Did You Steal My Money is one of my favorite Who songs.

B0098VXE50|4.0|I have really wanted to see this, but it received so many negative reviews from my friends that I waited until now to see it.  I was very impressed with the religious symbolism and the use of imagry to portray the moral dualism between the queen and snow white.  The musical score was also amazing.  When Snow White defeated The Queen, I was taken for a moment by the beauty of the orchestra playing the \\"background\\" music.  I enjoyed the film very much, and I will watch it again so I can see if I can pick up more hidden easter eggs of symbolism.  As far as the acting went, I think that Charlize Theron's rendition of the queen was superb.  The rest of the cast was also very impressive.  I am not a big fan of Kristen Stewart.  However, I think that the director did a good job of giving us the best of her acting abilities, and it also seemed like she had very few lines for a main character.  I am only giving this movie four stars, because I can't give it four and a half.  I would say to watch this movie if you feel like watching a movie that will make you think, but still keep you blissfully far away from the realities of our modern world.  If you are looking to watch a great action movie, the plot may seem to drag a bit and the action is not extremely action packed.  However, if you are looking for visually stimulating movie that is rife with symbolism, you will not be dissapointed.

B0076XIS4O|5.0|If you had asked me a few months ago if I liked pop-sounding electronica with copious amounts of samples and higher-pitched/baby-voiced vocals, I might have laughed and exclaimed, \\"Hell no!\\" But Grimes is proof that it is always better to remain open in life so you don't miss out for the simple fact of self-limiting rigidity, because her music is nourishing, inspiring and makes me dance and feel happy.<br /><br />I found Grimes one day on accident during an Odyssey through YouTube in a video of her performing at SXSW. Her presence, fearlessness in creativity and self-expression are beautiful and an inspiration.<br /><br />This album is wonderful! I highly recommend it...even to people who wouldn't normally listen to this kind of music!
0061692042|5.0|A calm and reasoned voice enraptures the reader in the telling of an odd tale of unfulfilled aspirations, morality and survival. Dell Parsons provides a wise narrator's confessional  of his life as a 15 year old living through a hellish event that would shape his and others lives forever. He and his twin sister Berner become the ultimate victims of a crime their parents commit. The crime is so botched and unprofessional that we are left to wonder. What could have been the motivation? Was any rational thought given to its consequences?<br /><br />Dell's father, Bev Parsons, is a stubborn, lost soul cut off from better times and a recently-ended military career in 1960. Bev's like a fish out of water, scheming a way to get ahead in a world with a different set of morals and purpose. He's a can-do guy who thinks he can figure a way to make it on his own, in spite of the fact that he and his family have lived the Army life, until now. The cost of that paternal support has been a nomadic existence between bases, where the family never learned to set roots. Not that they wanted to anyway. There's a palpable distrust of people outside their family and an anti-social feeling throughout the book.<br /><br />The Parsons could be anybody's quiet next door neighbor, perhaps a little odd, but mostly average folks that keep to themselves. Mid-life pressures seem to have arisen for a husband in a predicament of finding a new career and his submissive wife, Neeva, a college-educated Jewish girl lost on the prairie. She longs for what could have been, if she didn't get pregnant and succumb to Bev's charms. Dell and Berner are the good product of their relationship but end up becoming castaways. Other than their introversion, their oddities are not particularly striking for a couple of adolescents.<br /><br />Ford will probably be remembered for the exceptional opening two sentences of the book that foretells the two main events that happen to Dell. This telegraphing what is to happen becomes an effective device used on other pages too.<br /><br />  \\"First, let me tell you about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later.\\"<br /><br />The failed bank robbery tears apart the family and the murder afterwards actually results in bringing Dell back to normality - albeit in a different country. The book contains an unforgettable tapestry of characters and vivid atmosphere woven into a morality tale.<br /><br />The crimes his parents commit cause him to escape from the juvenile authorities to Canada.  His exile is arranged for him as he becomes a reluctant illegal immigrant refugee in a wild country with strange characters. Canada is to become the final destination for Dell. It's an accepting place where he can finally set roots even though its only 125 miles away from his last home in Great Falls, Montana.<br /><br />There's a theme that resonates throughout about what happens when we \\"cross the line\\". There are times we find ourselves at a precipice. Do we jump? Do we cross? Do we cheat? Do we steal? Would we kill? It's easy to say \\"I'd never do that!\\" But, Ford's point is there's a time when the right brew of people and circumstances allow the improbable to happen, despite possible tragic consequences. Once we cross that line we are irretrievably changed. There's no going back. Wisely, Ford does not spend much time rationalizing all this but leaves the reader to ponder on their own.<br /><br />In the end, Neeva, by all accounts is a loving mother. She leaves behind her writings from prison which try to make sense of her fate. She seems to absorb her fate and blame in titling her notebook writings, \\"The Chronicle of a Meek Person\\". She says in it \\"\\"You are only good if you can do bad and decide not to.\\" It begs the question as to whether she is was responsible for her actions or a victim of her limits - something she just didn't have the strength to overcome. Another deep philosophical question for the reader toponder.<br /><br />There's a pull to believe that the forces of nature and circumstance are controlling one's destiny, especially when a catastrophe befalls us.  We can't undo what's been done, even when it involves family. It's basically an optimistic viewpoint.  Even if you are a victim of circumstances, or even bad decisions, you still have a life to live and create for yourself. \\"You have a life and you need to fill it.\\"<br /><br />Dell tells of how he filled his life. His father, Bev, tried to fill his life with a delusional dream but filled his in prison. Neela fills hers as a prisoner of her personal life and then of the state, until she could not take it anymore. And Berner, never learns how to fill hers.<br /><br />There's a sense of Fitzgerald, Conrad and Salinger in the way this story is written and told by the narrator. Yet, mostly it's a unique conversation coming from a 60+ year old English teacher who is mostly speaking as a 15 year old. Perhaps Dell grew to be like his mother in the end. His book is a chronicle of events, much like she probably wrote as therapy in prison. It's straightforward, full of personal wisdom and, most of all, tries to make sense of a life lived but not chosen. The difference is that Dell could accept the world as it was, be was always willing to give up something and move on.ponder.<br /><br />There's a pull to believe that the forces of nature and circumstance are controlling one's destiny, especially when a catastrophe befalls us.

I concluded the book feeling a loose resolve. I can see why people would be frustrated but similarly, I think the book had to end the way it did, and I'm okay with it. What really drew me into the book is the way it is written. I think the language and style is catchy, and though a twisted reality, I loved the dark humor.

0525953728|5.0|I read this book in less then two weeks, it usually takes me about three months to be able to finish a book. I could not put this down. I'm no Navy Seal, I'm no ex-miltary or even fan of American politics of war. I'm a 27 year old woman who took a chance reading this book. It was fabulous! Easy to understand (besides some of the military jargon) which Owen usually explains. The first 170 pages are not about OBL (Osama Bin-Laden) as Owen refers to him. The first couple hundred pages are about Owen's experience being a Navy Seal and all the other missions that lead to the greatest killing of modern american history. Though these pages were interesting to say the least, the book got really good when Ownen explained the Bin-Laden mission. It was surreal to hear the first hand account of what really happened. Movies, media and ESPECIALLY!!! Washington DC exaggerate the truth and spin it into a glorified climatic mission. This was not the case. Though some of the things Owen explained were interesting to hear, like one of his teammates sitting on Osama's body in the helicopter because there was not room. I'll let you read the book and make the assumptions of the current political system and how cherished our Navy Seals and military in general are to this country. This is a must read.

B0080GUX2Q|4.0|This was certainly a lot more enjoyable to read than most self-help books.<br />I actually liked reading it which is a lot more than you say for the usual change your life, awaken the fear within, visualise success and ask the universe type books.<br /><br />The writing style is quite informal and discursive and despite the modesty of the author it is certainly a lot more rigorous and useful than the usual stuff from the snake oil salesmen. He recognises that what seems to work for him might not work for everyone.<br /><br />It probably isn't an essential read if you do always look at his column in the Guardian though obviously in this book he gives each subject a more in depth treatment.

It's also a well-balanced read with good pacing, character development, and action.  You can definitely feel the Twin Peaks influence, but Pines is by no means a TP clone.<br /><br />I can thank/blame Mr Crouch for more than a few nights of insomnia, as I was usually too wound-up after reading Pines.

B007VYQ9G2|4.0|First, in reference to the chimps attacking monkeys for food and each other for territory not being appropriate for children those critics must have spent their entire lives in concrete, asphalt and glass while only experiencing nature in parks and zoos. Any child raised on a farm, ranch, or in the developing/undeveloped rest of Earth has seen much \\"worse\\" (aka reality). Even the parts shown were heavily edited so that compared to other documentaries showing the same encounters, it was very tame.<br />Second, the film crew must have \\"tough skin\\" both literally and figuratively to survive the insects, rain, mud, animals and every other imaginable extreme discomfort to slog daily through those jungles for a year+ and for at times 20 seconds worth of useable film for that day's effort. I bow to you film crew. Didn't they think of bringing insect repellent netting for clothing either during or between times when they trekking in heavy forest?<br />Third, the decades of preparation and the years of filming/editing etc. was an amazing accomplishment.<br />Fourth, the storytelling part was a double edged sword in that it was engaging for the human interpretation and presentation of chimp life, but also seemed too anthropomorphizing under guidelines for a strict academic style doc. If you can look past that last part and just relate to the storytelling as a human to chimp interpretation then I find no fault in this exceptional filming.<br />Fifth, if after viewing this film the shared commonalities between chimps and humans is not apparent then some \\"soul\\" searching is in order.

B0056BMK6K|3.0|I think John Locke has some insightful information. And as he warns, if his books don't \\"strike a subtle chord, you're probably not part of [his] target audience.\\" So for those of you who are writing reviews to bash him, I'm curious why you're spending so much time recklessly scrutinizing his work when he is probably selling more books than you and probably didn't have your interests in mind writing this book in the first place.<br /><br />I must admit though...the one thing that bothered me was the fact that the entire first part of the book (and sporadically throughout) was keenly written to promote all of his other books to the reader. Whether subliminally received or as blatant as a smack in the face, it was quite apparent to me that Locke was not completely genuine about writing a book that solely focused on how to sell \\"1 Million eBooks.\\" Instead I learned all about his characters, books, and website...which I don't much care about.<br /><br />With that being said, he DOES offer some interesting tactics on how to promote your books and ideas via social websites and blog posts. But there is no nitty gritty uncovered secret...more of a lot of self promotion. On the positive side, it was a very quick read and I'm hoping to apply some ideas to my own marketing plan to sell the new philosophical book [[ASIN:B0093858UC Humantics]].

B005LAII6M|5.0|Resident Evil Retribution 3D Review: Even better 3D than RE: Afterlife<br /><br />Resident Evil doesn't cater to non-action fans, and Resident Evil Retribution proves this point with it's non-stop action onslaught from the opening credits to the ending.<br /><br />STEREO 3D:<br />The 3D in Resident Evil Retribution delivers in spades, being filmed in three dimensions with on the set 3D camera rigs, we get a consistency of powerfully layered visuals, with clear stereo 3D distance between the objects onscreen. There are also plenty of pop outs to flinch away from as bullets and blades fly out of the screen to great effect. This is one of the best 3D movies you can get as Anderson shows he's not only a master of action movies, but stereo 3D scene composition. So if you're looking for another demo worthy 3D disc, look no further than Resident Evil Retribution, boosting the 3D up even more than Resident Evil Afterlife 3D. Exceptional 3D.<br /><br />STORY:<br />This movie plays with your head sort of like Inception did, never letting you really know what's going on till about midway when Alice is finally let in on the reality of the situation. A bit jarring at first, but very unique for a RE Film. That aside, the story is fairly basic, from point A to B with some side stories thrown in for good measure. Finally, this fifth RE movie does a nice job paying tribute to the previous RE films in many ways as you'll see.<br /><br />ACTION:<br />If you know the Resident Evil series, you'll know there's usually a heavy emphasis on full on action. Retribution lives up to the term \\"Roller Coaster\\" by providing nearly non-stop action, literally. Just when Alice (Milla Jovovich) finishes on action scene, another enemy shows up and attacks, leaving little room for story development in between. So think of it as a total @ss kicking action movie made for your entertainment along the lines of The Expendables 2 and you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />The action sequences are incredible in terms of martial arts choreography (especially the opening attack on Alice in the white halls = amazing mix of roundhouse kicks, flipping, tossing, locking, cracking heads, chain flicking and shooting).<br />Then there's guns blazing every few seconds, Zombie attacks in the Suburbs, Las Plagas \\"Smart shooting zombies from the RE 4 game\\" confrontations in Moscow, fast speed car chases, stalking Licker monsters, giant butcher Axe Men attacks in the city, and an ending arctic fight scene that goes on for a glorious five minutes at least. All done with explosions, special FX and splattering blood better than before. Incredible action.<br /><br />ACTING:<br />Milla Jovovich (Aice) and a number of returning members including Michelle Rodriguez (Rain) deliver their lines with a relaxed believability that comes off as genuine. The roles of Ada Wong and Jill Valentine however, are a bit robotic, perhaps intentionally but still mildly distracting, as they were/are under the control of Umbrella. Leon makes an appearance, but again, some of the delivery of his lines could have been more natural. Otherwise, well done.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK: TomandAndy return from Resident Evil Afterlife and compose another great industrial electronic film score that rocks and beats along with the action. Excellent and worth a purchase for the soundtrack again.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />If you're a Resident Evil Fan of any of the films, this is highly recommended. One of most visceral, guns blazing action movies I've ever seen, despite the basic plot. Paul WS Anderson keeps getting better at delivering stylized, action packed movies.<br /><br />MOVIE: 9/10 Wow. Incredible example of an all out action movie.<br />STORY: 7/10 Very basic Point A to B with some side stories added<br />ACTION: 10/10. Amazing and beautifully composed. Movie is 80% slick action.<br />SPECIAL FX: 9/10. Great monsters, explosions, fx, but zombies are mostly fresh.<br />STEREO 3D: 9/10. It doesn't get much better. Most shots shinefor 3D.<br /><br />OVERALL: 9/10. If you love action and powerful 3D, don't pass it up.for 3D.<br /><br />OVERALL: 9/10. If you love action and powerful 3D, don't pass it up.

I would also like to see diagrams in the book showing the schematics of a silo, the descriptors are there, but need back up.

The movie had sexual references/innuendos that were not necessary to the movie's story line and that, I feel, were unnecessary at all.

It's probably not worthy of 4 stars but because it did its job in keeping my attention focused on the storyline, I'm impressed... for the most part.<br /><br />While the reviewers below are correct that it IS a very confusing movie, let me try to describe the key elements that I was able to grasp.  A young girl escapes from a cult that apparently keeps young women locked up, and it seems several men rape these women whenever they choose.  Now this one particular scene in the very beginning is pretty disappointing because of how it avoids bringing attention to the severity of the way the girl escapes.  In other words it should have been seen as a really big deal but instead the girl escapes to a restaurant, grabs something to eat, and apparently one of the cult members comes inside and demands that she returns to him (them) while she's sitting at a table.  Not really sure who that guy was.  Again, the storyline is confusing, but he didn't seem demanding enough and actually let the girl continue her escape plan.<br /><br />She then calls her sister on the phone (more like her mother given the age difference) and her sister allows the poor girl to live with her and her family.  Of course a big plothole here is that nobody seemed really concerned that this girl was apparently lost for 2 years and rather shockingly nobody felt the need to question where she was or what exactly happened.  Even when these questions were brought up, they were never addressed in a satisfying manner.  Of course the girl should have come right out and TOLD her sister that she was raped but... she held back.  Why, well, that's up for speculation I suppose.  Maybe she was too embarrassed or maybe she was trying to block out the horrible events.  Hey, she never really felt close to her sister, so perhaps she wasn't comfortable revealing such shocking news to her own sister.<br /><br />The story is definitely a slow-moving one, and the eerie silence that occupies the background is a continuous theme.  Another aspect that's confusing pertaining to the storyline is that, gradually, more girls are brought to the home.  Apparently it's a safe haven for kidnapped girls.  However none of the girls get the attention that Marcy May (or whatever her name is) does.  With all these faults, I really should lower my rating to a 3 but I just can't.  I was curious how the story would unravel and entertained overall.<br /><br />Anyway the girl being raped so many times apparently meant she learned to think such sexual activity is normal so, in one example, she walk into her sisters bedroom while she's having sex with her husband and thought it was perfectly normal.  Of course the sister gets angry when she realizes Marcy is lying on her bed and resting her head *while* the sister is going at it with her husband.  Strange storytelling.<br /><br />I really didn't understand the ending at all, or for that matter, the few events that led up to it.  Without spoiling what happens, let's just say there must have been a connection of sorts that I didn't realize.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad film but sort of lacking in the excitement category.  Maybe you'll understand it better than I did.
B00899DR40|5.0|The album itself is just so amazing. Justin Bieber really is great. The process was pretty simple to-that is the process of actually downloading the album. It downloads automatically to your iTunes and once you make a playlist, you can burn it to a CD yourself.
B001R60ESE|5.0|A must-buy for jazz music fans!Excellent audio and video quality!All the musicians enjoyed the perfomance,and showed their passion,it made me like sitting at the concert.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|After at least a dozen attempts, nothing downloaded. Only 0 Kb files without content. I'll try one of the many other options out there.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Awesome music. Goes really well with the game. A nice challenge for the brain. Very well made and executed. Hopefully I don't run out of levels too quickly.
B008IYOEZM|3.0|Seriously...the first 5 seasons were outstanding,  but this was was a confused mess with a lot of really bad elements that made no sense. The religious nonsense with Brother Sam that ultimately went nowhere, and the horrible squicky disgusting idea of Deb being in love with Dexter...Shark Jumping territory right there.<br /><br />Maybe they should have ended it with the 5th season...because if season 7 doesn't retcon most of what happened here, I don't see the show being able to redeem itself.

0525953728|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It's a collection of stories in rough sequential order from one of the most elite operators in the business, culminating with the Bin Laden raid.<br /><br />The narrative is very first-person, in the sense that you're rarely, if ever treated to a big-picture overview. It's more about how the author felt during his experiences. The weight of his load up a hill, the rising panic when his helicopter starts to falter. There's no flowery prose, just earnest descriptions that humanize a group of individuals more often portrayed as the progeny of Rambo and Robocop. They get tired. They miss. They're not immune to the allure of creature comforts (to the extent a hammock in the cargo bay might be considered one).<br /><br />And they have families, though these are often terribly shorted. Working at this level requires a commitment to train mind and body almost constantly. Everything else, the author says, takes a distant second. But this is not all self-sacrifice. The dirty secret of the SEAL community, he continues, is that they really enjoy their work.<br /><br />All of this is exciting to read. This book is very much a page-turner; I started and finished it on the same day. It's also a bit short. Most books of this format interweave action with history, alternating between adrenaline and perspective. This author doesn't. Save for a short aside on SEAL history, it's almost all ride. Or put another way, all wheat, no chaff.<br /><br />As with another reviewer, I was surprised just how much went wrong on the Bin Laden excursion, even with the most conscientious preparation. The SEAL modus operandi is to maximize unfairness. The ideal raid would catch their targets sleeping in underpants. Things get very precarious very quickly when efforts at surprise go awry. And yet, here, not one of the 20-odd boots on the ground was seriously injured. The most significant negative consequence was the incomplete destruction of a tail rotor. You really can't ask for a more sterling outcome.<br /><br />There are some political comments toward the end that some may take issue with, but frankly, for what these men contribute, they're entitled to whatever views they like. There's no grandstanding here. Nor is there overly revealing or otherwise untoward information. My feeling at the end was just relief that the special forces community is on our side. This book will almost certainly become a recruiting tool, not unlike the one that brought the author to the SEALs in the first place.more sterling outcome.<br /><br />There are some political comments toward the end that some may take issue with, but frankly, for what these men contribute, they're entitled to whatever views they like.

0307454568|3.0|Dichotomous Read<br /><br />I had read \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\"  and decided to read \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  I think Lisbeth Salander is one of the most exciting and intriguing fictional characters ever invented. Tough, antisocial, brilliant, devious, manipulative, these are all adjectives that could be used to describe her. When Stieg Larsson is writing about her, the book is exciting. When she is absent and Larsson is doing the back story it is boring. The opening is intense; Lisbeth is in the emergency room of a hospital having been shot in the head. The opening tenth of the book is about her. Will she survive and is there brain damage? Will she still possess her photographic memory? Then from this exciting beginning until the reader reaches beyond the two thirds point of the book Larsson builds his back story. It involves criminal activities of a secret group within the Swedish Intelligence Agency. They are intertwined with Lisbeth Salander but the pace is plodding. There are many characters introduced that are never fully fleshed out. Also there is a subplot involving Berger, Blomkvist's love interest, who leaves Millennium for another magazine. This subplot does nothing to advance the story line and is inconsequential. Blomkvist is the journalist who is trying to help and defend Lisbeth Salander. I almost quit reading the book, but plowed my way through this section. The last thirty percent becomes exciting again since all the disparate threads are pulled together and there is intense action. If this book could be tightened and shortened, it would be an excellent read, however, as it is, it takes some perseverance to finish.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This show rocks!  Much cooler than the Sapranos because they ride Harleys!!<br /><br />Can't wait for season five.  Excellent casting cameos too.
B000I0QLZU|3.0|I watched it in hindi? I think so didn't understand a word. Lots of action. I enjoyed it, but added my own soundtrack, so not sure what the original movie is like. Angelina Jolie looked good - and the did the butt kicking, borderline psychopath Lara Croft very well I thought.<br />I eat men for breakfast. And laugh.<br />She's got the whole sexy, booby thing downpat, but still quite likeable as a character. I will fry your testicles, with onions and sauce. And you will like it.<br />I haven't seen the second one but I'm looking forward to it. Treasure hunt, monsters - adventure/fantasy. Strong, female lead. What's not to like.<br />Daniel Craig plays her love interest, and does it really well (from the looks of it.) Tragic and loveable.
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|I remember seeing this concert when it happened and in playing guitar myself, I naturally have found myself listening to Clapton and enjoying every note and rift of a genius. It got me thinking about this concert and I searched in Amazon and sure enough it was here. Clapton at his natural best. Back to the roots and shows just how comfortable he is with his own musical talent. The guitar is such an extension of Eric himself. What a pleasure to be able to hear this all again.
B003UYUR10|4.0|I love this movie. So much fun and great actors and storyline. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the perfect role as a cheeky, clever but still fallable hero who falls for the princess of a neighboring kingdom. Great special effects and very entertaining. I always thought 'Aladdin' was pretty lame, but this is several levels up and much more interesting. Not quite perfect, but very good.<br />The female lead is anything but a helpless bimbo, which is refreshing, and gives Jakes character a decent run for his money.<br />The sparring between the two is very entertaining.
B007RTAR64|5.0|This is what my niece, 11 years old, said about her doll.  I love this Katniss Barbie doll! She is very durable and fun. Her jacket can come off and her mocking jay pin is on the front. Her boots, pants and shirt can come on and off too. Her arms and legs can bend, and her arrows can come out of the quiver.  She is the best Barbie that you can get!  Anyone who likes the Hunger Games should get her!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is an excellent story that definitely leaves you wanting to read more, more, more. Hugh is an excellent story teller, his characters are believable, and some of the situations literally leave you gasping for that last little breath of air before you actually break the surface and finally fill your lungs with oily dank air.<br /><br />Thank you Hugh, I can't wait to read more, especially about silo 40!

B007V80WUC|4.0|Their latest release has a more \\"cleaner\\" and more melodic sound to it, which may or may not appeal to everyone.  My favorite track on the album is \\"I Am\\", which is just down right beautiful, both musically and vocally.  Nicely done, guys.
B00881VLCE|1.0|constantly freezes.  very frustrating and annoying. every few minutes.  sometimes it comes back pretty quickly but most of the time you have to cancel the game.

B005HEXQN2|4.0|I wish in the Voyager series Chakotay's character was more developed. He's supposed to be a foil to Janeway's character, but I think because of the feminist appeal to have a very authoritative female captain they made his character to be a soft-masculine support to her. I wish they would have given him a little bit more punch. I believe they made him Seven's romantic interest because he was really the only option and because he's in the possible position of \\"father\\" to the crew members to Janeway's obvious mothering. But he isn't a strong character, as in he's not willful. he always bends to Janeway and follows her no matter what. For the most part I had no problem with this, However, as a romantic interest for Seven, that kind of stable but passionless support did not make well for good chemistry in regards to a romantic relationship. It's sad though, they really could have pulled it if they just pumped up Chakotay's character more. Have Janeway as the captain, and then have Chakotay and Seven continuously being shoved together in different scenarios. The idea of them coming together in the first place is that they're both on the same level in regards to Janeway. Her closest and most responsive children. They're two characters who are brought closer to themselves because of the time they spend with the captain,the time they are forced to spend with her.<br /><br />You can tell the show is written predominantly by men. In a lot of the relationships on the ship, the emotional dynamics are missing, especially here. They could have done so much. The chemistry could have been off the charts, but instead of having seven of nines relationships being natural they seemed made up and contrived. She just decided she liked Chakotay and viola! the last episode they end up getting together. The writers just decided to make her more human in the last season. Meanwhile they really could have been doing it the whole time. Easily could have had them both realizing how much they carefor the other, making it deep and heartfelt. Something very human and very anti borg.<br /><br />It also would have been fun to see Seven in the future. possibly hanging out with B'elenna's daughter. It's a bummer she was dead in this timeline. Seven and Torres were like sisters or should have been. Torres being the older one of course. It's Too bad they really could have richened up the character relationships, made them something worth watching.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Cant stop playing, wont stop playing. Graphics are awesome. It always the games with such simple gameplay that make it to the top.
B00723NWJE|5.0|This is a mellow, dark Norah album with a lot of passion - vocally, instrumentally & lyrically. Some seem to think it is too slow and/or different from her earlier material, but it's just another chapter in this young artist's impressive body of work. I really like the album and it's production and think it's one of her best...certainly worth the price of admission. Like most music, you have to be in the right mood to enjoy it, so listen to it when you're in an introspective mood and have the time to really listen to the nuances - not when looking for \\"up\\" background music for a pool party.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|Just ok - crude humor, is it getting a little old? Predictable, overdone.  I'm running out of words to describe this movie.  See if it you're bored.

B005SCSL56|5.0|wow what a wonderful book. i loved it. i am a 54 year old and still was enthralled with the story. i cant wait for grandbabies so i can read it to them. i do hope that chris will be writing more great stories.
B00514HDNW|3.0|This book moves about as fast as any 300+ page book I've ever read. That's the good part. It jumps right into the story with Neville isolated in a last-man-on-earth setting, able only to go outside during the day as factions of \\"living\\" and \\"dead\\" vampires prowl the night. There really are hardly any dull parts. There's one short chapter just of his thoughts that doesn't do much, but that's about the only slow part. And the book introduces a good amount of mystery as Neville tries to sort through the false parts of vampire legend versus the bacterial infection in the blood causing his current plight.<br /><br />There is a bit of stereotypically false \\"religion is just superstitious\\" theme in the book, whereas science is generally the only place he can turn for answers. There's a poke at the European Catholic Church for spreading the rumor that a cross can deter vampires when in the reality of the I Am Legend universe, only Christians who were turned into vampires are affected by crosses because of remaining psychological factors. Neville does pray in a moment of desperation in the story, but the incident is fairly isolated and is not a point of focus.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the whole theme of Neville seeking to find a rational, medical explanation for everything is that the author throws in an unexplained \\"deus ex machina\\" ending that changes the story such that he can proceed with his ironic ending that otherwise wouldn't work. But it seemed so forced, so contrived, and it leaves the reader unsatisfied with regard to the character's goal and one of the themes of the book, that the clues presented throughout the book actually pointed to some explanation.
B0086700CM|4.0|and addictive! I stumbled on this while looking for new games to play and I love it! I play on my Kindle Fire and sometimes the game won't recognize my swipes but all in all a very fun game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The sample of Fifty Shades of Grey that I read before buying gave no indication at all of what the book was all about.  Had I known the content, I would not have purchased.  I consider it literary pornography.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Buttons are large enough for even the largest fingers.  I have started using this instead of the small hand calculator that I used to use for basic functions.  Great when reconciling bank statements or when needing a quick calculation.
B0053O89JM|2.0|What a disappointment!  Season Eight makes you want to go back to Season Seven and rewrite the final episode so that House perishes when he crashes into Cuddy's house.  The writing is terrible, the charactors undeveloped and the acting below par.  It almost seems like the writers had a contest with the casting director to see who could do the worst job by creating a terrible charactor (Dr. Park) and filling the role with an awful actress (Charlyne Yi).  They should have quit producing this series while they were ahead.
B005OCHOZS|3.0|The book starts quite slowly with a lot of detail about the author's childhood. Although it does provide some context for the rest of the story, I found it a bit too \\"soppy\\" for a book that I would have like to be more about running. Scott Jurek is cleary an amazing athlete and I loved reading about his training and races, especially all the other quirky characters he meets along the way. The book ends rather abrubtly just as it startg gaining momentum. Most disappointing of all is that he doesn't complete the story of the Badwater 135 mile race, as this is where the book starts - very dramatically so, so the reader doesn't know how the race ended.<br /><br />Worth read just to learn about an amazing athlete, but for a good read about the subject of ultramarathons, Born to Run is a much better choice.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Im so happy. Its a good app.  Not giving it 5 stars because it runs a little slow sometimes. - word word  
B0080BFVPU|5.0|For some strange reason, this very entertaining and enjoyable film slipped under the radar and did not receive the praise it deserves.<br />It is a delightful dark comedy that has inspired numerous short stories and other films.  The music and photography in the film are<br />terrific, and the acting absolutely delightful and memorable.  For anyone who likes snappy dialogue, good acting, and humorous moments,<br />this film is a must see.
B00479SVBU|2.0|Worked out of the box, easy to control, but there was a significant level of digital noise from the decoding circuitry; I'd estimate ~30dB s/n versus max volume.  Not acceptable.<br /><br />Edit:  Opened 2nd unit purchased; noise emitted was the same, and the display didn't work.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|There's an awful snoozefest in the middle where she's not in the movie.  She is the only reason to watch the movie.  They should have given her more screentime because she's beautiful,has great screen presence, and is a great actress.

B004J4WN0I|5.0|\\"The first time I picked up this series, I was waiting for the next Dresden book and I saw that a lot of Dresden fans were also reading this, so I thought I would check it out. I was pleasantly surprised! I can see where the similarities to Dresden are but, if I may let my inner geek show for a moment, Harry tries to be Lawful Good but usually is more Chaotic Good. Atticus on the other hand is Chaotic Neutral and doesn't really feel the need to justify his actions. It's not that he's a callous bastard or anything, he's generally a pleasant fellow, he just doesn't worry much about collateral damage and doesn't berate himself over not saving stupid people who get themselves killed. If you're dumb enough to offend an angry deity, it's your problem not his. He's not a hero, just your average REALLY old Druid. He wants to live his life, hang out with his very cool dog and enjoy the occasional meal of fish and chips or a good whiskey. Unfortunately for him, a lot of supernatural baddies have it in for him and as a result magical madcap and mayhem ensues. Not being forced to follow the rules of modern morality, or any other rules for that matter, gives Atticus the freedom to do things that I think a lot of people wish they could, but it also brings a lot more trouble his way. I don't foresee many quiet days in this Druid's future and I'm looking forward to enjoying every chaotic moment of it.\\"
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is an incredible game with a ton of content. The developers have done a great job making this game easy to get into, but it is still very challenging. There are 3 difficulty modes and I'm about 2/3rds of the way through the easiest and am definitely challenged. My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be a suspend feature where you can save in the middle of the course. It would be a beret mobile game with that feature.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I found this movie awhile back and my family and I absolutly loved it.  I was really surprised to find that none of my other friends had even heard of it.  I make everyone watch this movie!  It is so funny and original.  Love the actors and the plot.  most definitly 5 stars.
031620157X|5.0|This is a great book for any reader at about the age of 11. This book entertains you and it has so many of the fairy tale characters we know and love(Snow White,Cinderella) and the ones we actually dont like (Big Bad wolf,Evil Queen). Definetly recommended. May be a few innapropriate words if you are reading to a child but its possible to skip them

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really good at letting you know how much battery you have left. I put it in my notification bar so I know how much battery I have left. It's also good at telling you how long you can be on a certain app before your battery runs out. For example, it tells you how long you can be on the web. I recommend to anyone that wants to be sure on how long they can be on their kindle before it dies on them.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Very disappointed, these books are becoming too predictable, the description in minute detail of every situation gets boaring.<br />If this main character is to become more believable the author needs to make him more vunerable.

B005LAIHSQ|2.0|DVD disk plays OK, but the Blu-Ray disk is less than perfect even though the sleeve boasts \\"perfect Hi-Def picture. Perfect Hi-Deb sound?. Maybe they just tried to load too much on it. It claims to have numerous bonus features, but getting them to play is more than tricky. I did try other Blu-Ray disks in my collection and they played just fine.<br />I think in the rush to get a copy with all of the supposedly alluring extras, Universal put out a defective product. Gave it two stars only because I can play the DVD even though I paid for and looked forward to the Blu-Ray copy. Wonder if I can return it? What do you say, Amazon?

1401322786|5.0|As soon as I started reading I heard my own words echo \\"please not yet\\". As with all of your books, I was taken back in time, reliving my own memories. Those words at their most meaningful moment were spoken before my Dad passed of cancer. While reading I was in continual awareness of every aspect of my life. I was in awe of how many times I recalled saying \\"just not enough hours in a day\\". I had never once, thought about a time when hours weren't counted. I was astonished at myself for never considering there were days when the clock wasn't ticking, telling us to hurry up, or begging life to slow down. Mr. Albom, you always find a way to pull from me things that are stirring inside. I'm always so connected to your words. It is as if they have been written just for me. Once again I hold onto a written treasure that has taught me an invaluable lesson in life. Even though the pages of the book are closed, they will continue to be opened in my heart to remind me \\"It is never too late or too soon, it is when it is supposed to be\\". Thank you for your continued inspiration and glimmer of hope.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|From a somewhat literary snob (if it was a book, it shouldn't be a movie), I fell in love with this from the pilot.  NOT a Lost fan, but these writers, probably with the help of some research assistants, have provided us with sequels/prequels to most of the well-known fairy tales, and a number of the obscure.  And while it seems as if the whole thing centers around Snow White, this goes much deeper.  There isn't any \\"glossing over\\" the gritty parts, they stay fairly true to the original tales in terms of starting point, and they take off from there.  This is the Love Child of Twin Peaks and Northern Exposure - without the Log Lady.  Can't wait for the second season!!!

B00746O3X8|4.0|The Opteka harness worked great for my purposes. The chest harness kept my DSLR in place while I used hiking poles in both hands. The safety strap IS important, as I was also wearing a waist pack and bending (e.g., to sit) sometimes dislodged the camera from the harness.<br /><br />I had less success with the holster for the second DSLR, but I can't fault the Opteka for that - I wanted to carry a second camera with a 70-300 zoom lens in that position, and the lens tended to extend (a common problem). It was OK for short distances, but not for extended use.<br /><br />All in all, it was $45 well spent for what I needed.

1401324649|5.0|Allan Karlsson firmly believes that \\"When life has gone into overtime it's easy to take liberties.\\"  So when he crawls out the window of his nursing home, just minutes before his 100th birthday party, sparking a manhunt and a cascading chain of events, he takes it all in stride.  Allan first makes his way to the bus station, where he buys a ticket to as far away as he can get for a 50 crown note.  A young man asks Allan to watch his suitcase while he takes a dump, and Allan impulsively decides to board his bus with the young man's suitcase, leaving the angry young man behind.<br /><br />It turns out the young man is part of a criminal gang (albeit a small, bumbling one) and the suitcase is full of cash.  As Allan traverses the Swedish countryside, with law enforcement and a criminal gang on his tail, he proceeds more or less obliviously, in search of a good meal and a drink of vodka.  As the story unfolds, Jonasson takes us on a series of flashbacks, telling Allan's life story.  In his century of life, his pursuit of vodka and a good meal took him from Sweden, across Europe, Asia, and the U.S.  Along the way, he dined with presidents and other key figures, crossed the Himalayas on foot, and aided in the development of the atomic bomb.<br /><br />Allan's simple, common-sense approach to life and Jonasson's wry observations make the book.  For example, on the \\"fantastic wealth\\" oil provided for England and Iran.  The wealth went to \\"mainly England, if the truth be told, but that was only fair because Iran's sole contribution to the project was cheap labor--and of course the oil itself.\\"  Then there was the time Brezhnev \\"thought that Afghanistan needed his help.  So he sent his elite troops into the country, and they happened to kill the sitting president, so that Brezhnev had no choice but to appoint his own.\\"  Then there was the Anglican priest who tried to convince some Iranian communists to adopt Anglicanism so that \\"Anglicanism would become the state religion in Iran the day the communists took over.\\"  He did try to pray about his work in Iran: \\"But God answered with silence.  He did that sometimes, and Father Ferguson always interpreted it to mean that he should think for himself.  Admittedly, it didn't always work out well when the pastor thought for himself, but you couldn't just give up.\\" I can relate to that!<br /><br />The 100-Year-Old-Man is a fun read, with understated humor and a convoluted story line.  This is the kind of book that Dave Barry's Lunatics was trying to be.  I was reminded more of Jaroslav Hasek's The Good Soldier Svejk.  I only wish Peter Sellers were alive to play Allan in the movie version!  It's been a best seller in Sweden since its publication in 2009, and is now available in English in the U.S.<br /><br />Thanks to Edelweis and the publisher for the complimentary electronic review copy!Iran the day the communists took over.\\"  He did try to pray about his work in Iran: \\"But God answered with silence.

B005LAIIRQ|3.0|not what i thought movie would be.  a little disappointed in content of story line.<br />sometimes a little hard to see action, screen too dark
1612183956|1.0|With due respect to the other reviewers, this definitely may NOT be the book for you.  Presents as a crime thriller, but doesn't pass muster as credible in that genre, then turns into poorly written futuristic, hard to follow, macho fantasy.

This movie was easy to write off even as it was unfolding on the screen.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the whole plot device centering around a bracelet? Lame.

This book should be tied  to the back of a car and drug, the proceed to be utilized as toilet paper before doing justice to humanity and burning every copy off the face of the earth.

This is the kind of thing that is a prime example of the deterioration of our society as a whole, and way to teach our daughters to be compliant iittle scapegoats and accept spousal abuse for the notion of a romantic fairytale.

B001A4LYN2|5.0|This movie is truly amazing, but not for the faint of heart.<br />For me it is best encapsulated by its culminating metaphor:<br />Misanthropy and violence sucked greedily through a straw.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />A lot of the other positive reviews cover the specifics of this disc, so I won't bother to recapitulate. This is Dylan in full roar. Some don't like the \\"gravel\\" in his voice... well...if you don't dig it, you don't dig it. But it doesn't bother me one little bit -- it's a selling point, in fact -- and it doesn't sound as if it bothers Dylan, either. He is singing to the hilt.<br /><br />The only problem with the record is that some of these songs stick in your brain and you can't get rid of them. I mean, I've been walking around for days with the phrase \\"like the Early Roman Kings...\\" popping up in my mind as an addendum to just about anything someone might say. Same thing with the last two lines of \\"Long and Wasted Years.\\" And the refrain to \\"Roll On, John\\" (what a beautiful song) -- also adhesive.<br /><br />It's kind of pointless, I think, to rank or compare Dylan's records -- they are so different. Like the Early Roman Kings. (damn -- there I go again...) For what it's worth, I've been enjoying this one more than any his records since \\"Love & Theft.\\" But then again, I thought his Christmas record was great. How many artists in any field are prominent for over fifty years and still coming up with stuff this invigorating? Picasso, Duke Ellington... uh... there are others, but the list isn't all that long.<br /><br />Just fantastic.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I need more than 5 stars and a better word than \\"brilliant.\\"<br /><br />This book sucked me in and held me to a point where sometimes it was hard to take, but I still couldn't shake loose of it.  I woke up in the middle of the NIGHT needing to read this book!  And yet, there wasn't a single likable character.  Unbelievable!<br /><br />However, there IS no \\"happily ever after,\\" no resolution that will make you feel good.  Fortunately, I don't need that, just good writing.<br /><br />Ms. Flynn's observation into human nature and the nature of relationships is biting, true, and really painful.  The planning that must have gone into all the plot twists leaves me in awe.<br /><br />I will be thinking about this one for a while.  I look forward to reading her other books, but I think I need to recuperate from this one first!!<br /><br />Bravo, Ms. Flynn!
0525953728|5.0|Earlier this week I finished reading No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden. Despite the uproar from the Department of Defense (DOD) and others, I found the book not - I repeat not - to reveal any secrets or inside information on operations planning of the SEALS or any other branch of service.<br /><br />As for talking out of turn, the SEAL who wrote this book wasn't the first to talk about the mission, nor will he probably be the last. After all, that mission has been used by President Obama as campaign fodder since it occurred. Come to think of it, didn't he even say that \\"I killed Bin Laden...\\"?<br />You see, SEALS and other special ops groups consist of brave American warriors who make our country so safe. They do what we can't or won't do. As a US Navy vet and a citizen, I salute each one and thank them for their sacrifice.<br /><br />When the author was asked, \\"I'm not a SEAL and probably couldn't do it if I tried, but what can I do to help?\\", he replied in his book:<br />  ...Don't just live, but live for a purpose bigger than yourself. Be an asset to your family, community, and country.<br />  ...you can donate your time and money to a veterans' organization that supports wounded warriors...<br /><br />The SEAL writing No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden has already accomplished the first part, IMHO. And, in donating a majority of the proceeds of his book to veterans' organizations that do help our wounded warriors, he will be accomplishing the second part of his answer.<br /><br />No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden is not a one-person book, although it is written from the perspective of the author; instead, it's about the sacrifices made by the true heroes of our country.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find out the true story of how Bin Laden's life ended by reading No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden. Then, follow the author's advice on how you can make your life count. I'm just saying...

B007GCY8FS|1.0|With two our three exceptions the Reacher books have been real page turners for me. I couldn't lay them down. Most of them I have read for the second time already. But this one ...? I don't know. Where's the beef? With all the \\"tricks\\" about the words without an \\"a\\", the landscapes and gas stations in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri ..., it seems that Lee Child was searching for words in order to fill the empty sheets of paper. It took me three days to finish the book, there wasn't any incentive to read. Once the plot was untangled, somewhere in the middle, the only question left was: What will the body count be this time?<br /><br />Okay, things happen. So I will wait one year and give Mr Child another shot with another book; hopefully a better one. Otherwise my only conclusion would be: Neither Jack Reacher is ageless, nor is Mr Child.<br /><br />P.S.: I wasn't aware that there's a movie coming, therefore thanks for the many hints around here. But ... Tom Cruise = Jack Reacher? Jack Reacher = Tom Cruise? Never, ever! Reacher books are not thaaaaaat popular over here (across the pond), so I doubt that this movie will ever see the theaters here. Probably going directly to DVD/Bluray. But that's another point I don't understand. Why making a movie with a one-size-fits-all star, why not a TV show, like they did (for example) with the Walt Longmire stories on AETV? The actors there aren't coming fresh from the tabloids, but they are authentic.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This pocket-sized sharpener is great! It works wonderfully on knifes but I even used it on my machete and it worked well.  The size is great for bringing on hikes and the different sharpening options make it very versatile.  The price is very reasonable as well.  I would highly recommend this little sharpener for any sharpening needs... kitchen knives, outdoor knives, and even thin machetes.  This will probably not work well on axes; may need a sharpening stone for that.
B008BO61BE|5.0|Screaming for Vengeance single-handedly changed my whole orientation towards music. I became a metal fan and album purchaser and tour attendant and Priest was always the anchor band for me each year as I got their album first and learned about a lot of other groups through their connections. I used this album cover when I ran for student council president in high school and when I ran for student government rep in college and won both elections and I pretty much played this in lp form until it degraded completely. Nice to get a new copy and to reminisce with the US Festival footage. When people say what was it about the Priest, one can just give them or play them this footage and you have a sense of it. Not a lot of frills, not much in the way of stage set..just straight ahead blast them. The sing along of You've Got Another Thing Coming with nearly 300,000 participants is one of those moments that can never be duplicated.

No where near the developed plots and scary bad guys that we are accustomed to.  We've had heat, cold, radiation poisoning, child abuse, clever counterfeiting, drugs left over from WWII, and then some...and in this work we have some thin, extremely thin, plot of middle east banking...and it just wasn't developed at all.  a bunch of three ring binders just doesn't get the job done.<br /><br />disappointing!

B000VSYDRM|1.0|Firstly, the movies is quite long, not so much quantitatively, but more in a sense that it is lacking in speech of any sort and goes directly to murderous actions a mere hour into the film without any real explanation of what the purpose of what our wasted two hours was.  Therefore, I would have to not recommend viewing this film, ever.  On a side note, Dustin Hoffman did a wonderful job portraying a washed-up man clinging to his past.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the game. It really makes you think yo solve it. Keeps you're mind going and is never dull. It's almost addicting. Good for problem solving. My three year old grandaughter visited this weekend and she wanted to play the game so I put the game on easy and she had a great time playing the game too. It was easy for even her to learn to play.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I own this blu-ray. Not sure how I got it delivered early from another company but I did and I can tell you that this is the finest Batman film ever made. It is up there with Batman Mast Of The Phantasm.<br /><br />As a life long fan of Frank Millers Graphic Novel I was excited to see this following Batman Year One which also served the source proud.<br /><br />There are a few differences from the source. Most notably, Millers trademark voice over narrative of Batman is gone. In the comic we really got into Bruce's head and Batman's. The good news is that I did not really notice this until I got my novel out after viewing. This does not detract from the great story. Another difference is the scene with the general who supplies the Mutants with weapons. There is an additional scene where Batman confronts the general rather than finding him dead.<br /><br />The film finishes in a perfect place with the fight with the mutant with the incredible line \\"...this is an operating table and I'm the surgeon.\\"<br /><br />The voice talent is top notch. I'm a Kevin Conroy fan but Peter 'Robocop' Weller does a great job and its good to hear and see Batman and he truly belongs in the animated universe. The problem with Nolan's live action films is that they are great crime dramas but everytime Batman is on the screen it is embarrassing. It is a man in a suit with a stupid voice. It never worked for me.<br /><br />This animation however, is a great experience and I cannot wait for part 2.<br /><br />Extras on the blu-ray include a sneak peek at part 2, a couple of episodes from the animated series (Two Face) and a series of trailers.<br /><br />Buy it now.
1451608659|4.0|I think it's great that Dominique felt comfortable to open her life to the public. She doesn't hold back about the emotional and sometimes physical abuse she suffered at home, as well as the problems she faced with coaches in the gym. She's painfully honest and I felt this memoir was a good balance of her early life and her 'public' life (meaning the time when she was best known to the world, probably 95-98). I do wish she had done more on her later life (husband, kids and her comeback).<br /><br />I also think it's great that she casts the spotlight on the way gymnasts are chosen for the Olympics today...it's much different than it was in 96 and maybe not for the better. The idea that a committee decides who goes and who stays (and not an athletes' performances) is questionable and troubling. I think it's great that she exposes some of the problems in the sport while still maintaining her love of it.<br /><br />I did find myself wondering about the 'other side' of the Karolis. Dominique makes it sound like after months of abuse and controlling behavior, they just dropped her without a word and then treated her like a stranger. And this may be true...but I wonder if there was something else that happened. I don't think she's lying, but things have a way of being exaggerated, especially if you feel you're the 'wronged' party.<br /><br />My other issues were minor. The jumps between her life story and the discovery of her sister are jaring sometimes and she tends to repeat herself on occassion.<br /><br />Also, and this might not be something Dominique had any control over, but at the end of her book, in the summary they call her one of the greatest, best-known gymnasts in the world. This is over-blown. Yes she did great things and had a successful career, but she's not one of the greatest. Her claims to fame...youngest to win a national title, youngest to win an Olympic gold medal, part of the first womens team to win team gold. And those are great accomplishments. But she won ONE gold medal at one games. For me, to be one of the greatest, you need to have more hardware (Nadia, Olga, Shannon Miller, Nastia Luikin) or show your dominance in the sport over multiple games (Larissa, Dominique Dawes). But like I said this might not have been anything she had any control over, but it still was odd to me.<br /><br />I wish we had half stars on this, because I'd really like to give this 3 and a half stars.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nicely written memoir of a young women who overcame great odds to become an Olympic champion.

I have a Kindle Fire, and the alarm is plenty loud on 90%.I don't use it for an alarm clock at night, so I wouldn't know how bright the screen is. It doesn't drain my battery in sleep mode that mutch eather. You do have to start up he kindle befor u can turn the alarm off. But if you're really that lazy, you can set the settings so all you need to do to turn thenalarm off is press the power button and shake. I wish it had a stop watch though. I guess not everything is perfect. Besides those few down sides, this is an EXCELLENT app.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|When I first heard about Walter Isaccson's effort to document Steve Jobs life in a biography I knew this was going to be on my must read list.  So much has been written about Jobs that I really looked forward to what I hoped would be a very dispassionate look at the man and the legend.  The writer did so successfully with his biography of Ben Franklin.  Similarly, 'Steve Jobs' does not disappoint.  This book receives here one of my rare 5-star reviews.<br /><br />The early influences of Jobs life - from his adoption to the role his parents played in nurturing a child they felt was special - are well sourced and presented.  There clearly exists a thread that is woven into the principal's fabric of being (self) that if pulled would seemingly unravel so much of what held all the pieces of a disparate personality together.<br /><br />As I read the book over a period of a couple of weeks I was traveling on business listening on my i-Pod, talking and surfing the web on my i-Phone while surrounded by so many others of my 'species' (Jobs wording) similarly engaged with myriad Apple products. This is the essential motivation of Jobs - making life more engaging through 'insanely great' designed products.<br /><br />Genius has its quirks.  Even the cover art of the book is reminiscent of the now famous Jobs unblinking stare.  As others recounted both personal and professional behaviors of the man, my first thought was that Jobs was highly functional while residing at some point in the Asperger's spectrum.  I'm likely wrong but symptomatically there seems to be a correlation.<br /><br />While not particularly philanthropic, it's difficult to overstate the significance Jobs has had on transforming the way in which humanity accesses so much of its daily content.  He and his companies (Apple, Pixar, etc.) reconfigured entire industries (i.e. music, digital animation, etc.) and the mechanisms by which we all consume this array of media.<br /><br />The book provides telling insights by those closest to Jobs both personally and professionally.  The writer certainly felt the pull of time as Jobs approached the end of his life as the book was being written.  'Steve Jobs - The Biography' serves as an epistle of sorts.  From Jobs perspective he acknowledged wanting to have something in writing so his children knew the value of his work - time that took him away from his family.  Too, the irony exists that for such a controlling personality, he chose not to exert any editorial sway over the narrative.by those closest to Jobs both personally and professionally.

0425263908|1.0|It really is a shame that this book is being presented as one that \\"Fans of Fifty Shades would like\\". I heartily disagree. This book is nothing like FSOG. In fact, the entire character of the story (and the characters) is utterly different from that presented in FSOG. But, let's focus on Bared to You as it stands alone....<br />  The characters have virtually no development, and what little development they do have doesn't seem to make sense. Eva is supposed to be some damaged girl who suffered sexual abuse in her youth, yet her rich-girl-about-town, casual-sex mentality does not match that life story at all. She acts and sounds like every scatter brained twenty-something who leads a promiscuous life and then complains about \\"not being valued\\". What kind of value does she want, when the character casually owns to having frequent one-night stands and \\"friends with benefits\\"? In short, Eva is unlikable. Her relationship to sex is base and gross and just as flippant as that of Gideon Cross, yet the reader is supposed to act as if Cross is the one with sex issues. No, no. BOTH of these characters are disgusting.<br />  The language....What can I say. It's nasty, and utterly unnecessary. FSOG became a smash hit without using any vulgar language (save the F word). The in-you-face grossness of the language is not enticing or arousing, it's offensive, like having a bucket of ice water suddenly poured down your back. I cannot for the life of me understand why/how this kind of crap gets published when there must be hundreds of better works available out there.

B001FB5634|5.0|The essence of this film is to highlight the struggle of trying to maintain your humanity under the most extreme dire and bleak scenario, the end of civilization. If you can digest all the disturbing elements of this film and buy into the reality of the father and son's journey...you'll realize that this story is incredibly deep with undertones of love and hope as this family tries to keep \\"the fire\\" burning  within, \\"the fire\\" that is the essence of the human condition, what keeps us from being animals. You'll know what I'm referring to when you watch this film. 5 stars for me, for an excellent book to film adaptation, for flawless acting, for hauntingly beautiful cinematography and for excellent direction. This film will stick with you for a while as it will provoke deep thought...you just can't help but ask yourself what would you do in that situation, especially if you have children. The subject matter is heavy and frightening at times but don't be afraid to watch this excellent film-Highly recommended
B004EPYZSK|2.0|I wanted to like it.  But the system of embedded cliches, uninteresting characters and dopey plot outlines just made it impossible on all levels.  Only Sam Rockwell infuses much-needed oxygen into the story in his sadly small part. You've been warned.
B004LWZW6U|1.0|It tries to be funny- it isn't!<br />It tries to be gory- it's not!<br /><br />As a fan of the last film this was incredibly disappointing.

031620157X|4.0|Completely independently of Chris Colfer's famous name, this is a great classic children's book. By virtue of being classic, that often means that readers need to tolerate a certain degree of cliche, which is true here, but Colfer also uses many original twists to keep this tale fresh. This is a story of twins Alex and Conner Bailey (twins are ever-popular in kids' lit!) and their accidental journey to a fairy tale world when they fall into a book of fairy tales given to them by their Grandma. Colfer shines when describing how important fairy tales are to Alex, and readers will be invested in why she specifically needs that world so badly. In the world Alex and Conner are from, their dad has died and their mom had to move them into a shabbier home in order to make ends meet, so the fairy tale realm is seen as a true escape.<br /><br />However, it's also dangerous, and they quickly realize the necessity of getting back home. The plot revolves around the twins' efforts to collect the items they need for the Wishing Spell, which should help them achieve their goal. Like in the Wizard of Oz, the Wishing Spell proves to be less important towards this end than they first thought, but during their journey, they experience a great deal of the fairy tale world, traveling to kingdoms run by Queen Cinderella, Queen Rapunzel, Queen Red Riding Hood, Queen Sleeping Beauty, and Queen Snow White, along with the Dwarf Forests, the Troll and Goblin Territory, and the Fairy Kingdom. The Happily Ever After Assembly is parallel to the United Nations, helping make laws and settle conflicts.<br /><br />All of the characters are classic archetypes, without the quirks of individual creations like some fantasy novels. They stay pretty true-to-form, with the exception of Queen Red Riding Hood, who is hilariously vain and selfish, and the Evil Queen, whose reason for being evil is eventually explored in depth in a successful passage. While the narrative is fairly predictable, most children will not have read enough fantasy for this to be an issue, and I think that they themselves will enjoy this book. That being said, right from the beginning it was very obvious who wrote the journal that guided them to the Wishing Spell.<br /><br />There were some stretches in terms of plot points - on occasion easier actions were available, yet the characters involved did not take them, or else what they did do seemed unlikely to actually succeed outside of a story. For example, when they're on the lookout for Red Riding Hood's original basket and are shown to the basket room by a handmaiden, they could have just asked the handmaiden which was the original, rather than searching through hundreds of baskets.<br /><br />Colfer's story is excellent at illustrating how different ways of thinking can be useful in real life situations. Conner feels inept within the context of a classroom, but his outside-the-box perspective allows him to cross a stream in the fairy tale world without waiting around to solve the bridge troll's riddle, and he climbs over the wall of a kindgom instead of spending hours looking for the entrance. He thinks quickly on his feet, and this saves them from many a jam. Alex's compassion, intelligence, and knowledge of fairy tales also plays a role in their quest. She is a character many young girls will be able to relate to - ostracized at school for being smart, but very lonely. She considers the fairy tale characters her best friends.<br /><br />Colfer pairs Jack and the Beanstalk with Goldilocks, making a convincing argument since they are both outdoor adventurers. Portraying Queen Red Riding Hood as horribly jealous because she wants to marry Jack is a fun twist that I think kids will get a kick out of, especially during a climactic point when Goldilocks and Red Riding Hood essentially have a catfight. Trollbella was hideously cute and she is another character that will resonate with children.<br /><br />There were a few plot twists towards the endthat I did not see coming (even if in retrospect, I should have), and this bodes well for child readers. The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell is very much in line with classic fantasy and fairy tales from earlier time periods, rather than modern fantasy, so I would recommend this book to children who enjoyed The Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, etc.that I did not see coming (even if in retrospect, I should have), and this bodes well for child readers.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|'The Deathly Hallows - pt 1\\" surpassed \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" as my favourite Harry Potter movie.<br /><br />I know many did not like this movie due to lack of activity, but I disagree.  It's not just \\"the camping movie\\".  Sure it was a bit more understated, but I thought it also showed off better than the other movies how far Radcliffe, Grint and Watson had come as actors.<br /><br />Visually, the movie was stunning. The muted tones were nice. The locations were incredible. Let's face it, the animation for the tale of the Deathly Hallows was frickin' awesome. And yes, there was enough action (c'mon, that run through the forest from the Snatchers, filmed on a zipline was great in the theater) to not make the movie as boring as some people seem to think it was.  I loved the Ministry of Magic scene, though the Malfoy Manor scene seemed darker in print version.<br /><br />I'm not to gripe about some of the minor changes from book to screen - it happened with all of them. Get over it. I liked the tent scene w Harry and Hermione dancing. I think the song choice of Nick Cave's \\"O Children\\" was brilliant.<br /><br />Yes, except for the wedding at the Weasley's, there are not many folks in the movie who aren't Harry, Hermione and Ron. There are no Hogwarts crew, but it works.  It was meant to be a solitary (well, solitary x3) journey and it was.<br /><br />Still. the overall feeling of the movie was isolation, introspection and survival.  The director, location scout and screenwriter covered this nicely - and the actors did a great job of conveying it all.<br /><br />Nothing is resolved in this movie and I think that also irked people.....but the last few movies were like that as well.  Still, it now ranks as the best Harry Potter film in the series - at least for me.
0425263908|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved the 50 shades trilogy, but the constant irritating \\"oh my\\", got on my nerves after awhile.  Sylvia day's writing style is refreshing, she introduces the characters, and keep the suspense and intense sexual nuance riviting throughout the book.  I will definitely be reading this copy a few more times waiting for the next two books to be published, and looking at the first book, it promises to be great reads too.

B0092MKTL2|5.0|This is a very good album. Imagine Dragons has a unique sound, and they put on a really, really fantastic live show. You can really feel their passion for music, both live and on the album.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can say about this album is that 4 or 5 of the songs are from previous EPs. I think they've probably been re-recorded or remastered, but they still sound pretty similar to their original incarnations. If you already own the EPs, then I think it's worth just buying the new songs individually.<br /><br />That being said, every song is a winner. Their hit single \\"It's Time\\" is actually probably my least favorite song on the album, and that's a great song. That's how good this album is.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Excellent book. It was very inspiring to read. I would highly recommend this book. I will check out PCT next time I'm in the Sierras
B005IQZB14|5.0|I read a short review in a magazine about this book and was instantly intrigued. I ordered the book and it sat around for a few days before I could start it. Once I started it I was hooked. Was up late reading, took it to work to read at lunch hour. Any spare moment was spent reading it. I hated for it to end. Great book. Bought one for my mom and my sisters and a friend for her birthday. She too, loved it.
B006H5120E|5.0|Can't wait to watch this movie in 3D.  Please note this copy does not include an Ultraviolet copy (UV).  I hated UV when it first came out with HP7.2 but now that I've discovered VUDU I'm loving it and want all of my movies in this format.  For the price, seems like you should recieve a HD Itunes and UV copy so I'd wait and see if a better version with all the types is released in the near future.<br /><br />Ed

0525953728|5.0|It was hard to put this book down once I started it.  The first half of the book covered the author's experiences in the military prior to the Bin Laden mission.  The second half of the book covered the Bin Laden mission and the after effects.<br /><br />What comes across is a compelling story of heroes and heroism.  The author tells the story in the first person (\\"I\\") to provide his perspective of what happenend, and this puts the reader in a \\"you were there\\" mode.  Unlike some of the other reviews, to me, the humility of the author came through.<br /><br />As he mentions a number of times in the book, he wrote this book to set the story straight.  In the after effects section, he mentions all the stories that were written about the mission, claiming to be the true story, that in fact were totally incorrect.  (And, of course, although he doesn't mention it, I'm sure that he was concerned about Hollywood's version that is coming up.)  Further, you can tell that the author and his fellow Seal colleagues are frustrated with the leaks, for example, less than 24 hours after the mission, the fact that the Navy SEALs pulled it off was leaked to the press.  None of the Seals did this.<br /><br />His story is very powerful, and provides an excellent perspective of the front line against the war on terror.  I highly recommend it for all patriots.

1451627297|4.0|There's nothing like a compelling Stephen King novel-a wild, mesmerizing, roller coaster ride. I used to be a huge fan as a teen and through my twenties. But then he changed-or perhaps I did-it all seemed too weird, too violent, too vulgar. So I stopped reading, and just reminisced of the good ole' books such as The Stand, Misery, The Shining, the excellent short stories such as Shawshank Redemption, The Body,(inspiration for the movie Stand By Me), to name a few. Well, with 11/22/63, the old Steve is back! An incredible, clever story exploring what could happen if you could time travel and change history-in this case stop Lee Harvey Oswald from shooting JFK. A classic King book as much of the action is in small town Maine, and many references to past King books. And a love story, for a change. Fun read, historically thought provoking.

0525953728|5.0|This book is an honest version of a Vince Flynn novel, a great read! And, a great service to the people of the United States. The author serves up truth, even as Leon Panetta and the White House continue to lie about and seek to cover up the events surrounding the death of UBL. It is a gutsy manifesto of a not so glamorous and nearly disastrous event that was made simple and clean by the exceptional skill of those whose job it was to make it happen.<br /><br />Possibly, an unintended result of the book, at least for me, is the truth that once the mission was approved, the notions of \\"Rule of law\\" and \\"All men are equal in the eyes of the law\\" were thrown to the wind. Owen clearly tells us that \\"fire fights in close quarters never end well\\" and even though he mentions the DOD or White House lawyer making it clear it was not an assassination, we are clearly left with the impression that their is going to be no trial for UBL. The author admits that these guys (SEALS) have wanted to get UBL from the day the towers went down, it is what they are trained to do. Is this justice in the eyes of the law? Well, from the book we can see that in no uncertain terms, there was simply no other way.<br /><br />The author also does a good job of giving credit where credit is due. Not only does he credit the team, he gives credit to the woman that tracked down UBL and made the whole operation possible in the first place. Although she obviously didn't work alone, it is a striking contrast to the credit assumed by those of happenstance, we know who they are, who have done so little in comparison and yet hold themselves up in front of the country as having sole responsibility for the demise of UBL.<br /><br />So the value of this book is immense in its truthful way of telling the story. I view it as a must read for all Americans, we will all take away from it what we want to see, but at the end of the day it sheds light on both the lies of our government and the mundane, ordinary task ofridding the world of this criminal, even if at the expense of acting outside the law.<br /><br />I praise Owen for a job well done and a book well written.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Predictable and boring after the first few chapters. The writing is not very good, alot of repetitive phrasing. Don't read it unless you are willing to commit to the sequels as the ending is not very satisfying.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of the Phantom of the Opera (POTO) so I really wanted to love \\"Love Never Dies\\" (LND), the sequal to POTO.  It is a beautiful play without any comparison to POTO.  In a comparison, it still falls short of POTO.  However, since it's cheap to rent/buy this DVD, I still recommend it.<br /><br />REASONS TO SEE LND - 1) The Phantom, Christine and Raoul are more \\"human\\" in LND.  They show more emotions so the audience can relate to them more on a personal level.  Each one of them is flawed but I still wanted all of them to be happy. The Phantom is no longer a cold Angel of Music but a feeling human being who shows his vulnerable side and fights to get back his Christine.  There is more dimension to this Raoul and I was very touched by his parting note to his wife.  Christine is very conflicted between the 2 men who love her.  Each actor portrays these characters perfectly.  2) The child actor who plays Christine's son Gustav adds to the play.  He is pint-sized but what a great voice!  3) The set is beautiful.  Many scenes remind me of Cirque du Soleil.  I was wowed by the crystal obelisks that contain live actors who are dressed up as oddities - a mermaid, a shaman, a 4 legged man, etc.  What eye candy!<br /><br />REASONS I STILL LOVE POTO MORE - 1) The songs in LND never strike a chord with me the way the songs in POTO did.  There is no iconic \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"Music of the Night\\", \\"All I Ask of You\\", or \\"Masquerade\\" songs.  The only two songs that are somewhat memorable are \\"Devil takes the Hindmost\\" and the song that the Phantom composed for Christine for her last performance (I assume it's called \\"Love Never Dies\\").  However, they still do not compare to any of the above songs in POTO in the music or the lyrics. 2) It's not necessarily a bad thing but the costumes in LND is so much more modern that it is hard to believe only 10 years had passed between the two plays.  It seems like a whole century had passed.<br /><br />I think the key reason why LND did not do well in England and Australia is that POTO is still playing and thus it overshadows LND.  When given a choice between the well-established POTO and the newbie LND, most probably went for POTO.  I bet LND would have done MUCH better if POTO were no longer playing.y LND did not do well in England and Australia is that POTO is still playing and thus it overshadows LND.

B005LAIHSG|2.0|Leaving the terrible acting aside, the plot of this movie is horrible. (Kstew's facial expressions had us howling. Especially the one when the huntsman was talking to her, encouraging her or something. She looks at him like he just suddenly started speaking Japanese. It is an epic acting fail.) You could have had the best actors out there, and this would have been a failure. I think whoever was responsible for this movie just couldn't decide what they wanted it to be. Action, angst, madness? It tries all and fails miserably. Seriously, \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" is better than this.<br /><br />**************Spoilers*************<br /><br />My problems with the plot:<br /><br />***Someone needs to read \\"The Top 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord\\" (number 2 can be read as \\"sewer\\" instead of ventilation duct. Number 3 is especially applicable.)*****<br /><br />1. Why is there a nail in the wall of a castle? Anyone?<br /><br />2. She took him out with a scratch to the face. Come on, at least leave him with one less eye. (the whole pedobear thing was really over the top as well. We already know he's evil. don't make it too much) Why do the whole fake-seduction routine anyway? come on, she (the character) should be perfectly innocent at this time. Guile should be beyond her.<br /><br />3. Why tell the dupe he is being duped right at the exact moment when you shouldn't? (see suggested reading above)<br /><br />4. If the dark forest is so dangerous that no one comes out alive, why does EVERYONE come out alive?<br /><br />5. If the movie is supposed to be about \\"inner beauty\\", why do the women have to disfigure themselves? Because the evil queen is crazy, right? but crazy isn't reliable, so this is a logic fail.<br /><br />6. Why are all the queen's henchmen ok with all this? They aren't apparently getting anything out of this, the first time some real work comes around, the first thing she does is outsource it. And she can make minions out of glass, so why does she need henchmen anyway? Why did she need a \\"real\\" army when it's pretty hard to kill a broken piece of glass?<br /><br />7. Apparently her brother wants her as well. Ew[...] too much over-the-top evil. (If my brother ever tried to kiss my neck like that, he would soon be my sister)<br /><br />8. How come Snow White knows how to ride a horse after being locked in a tower most her life? (I'm pretty sure the first horse is a magic fairy horse, but still. And bareback even.) Or dance? Or tame trolls? (or ride in plate? or swing a sword?) And why are there fairies in the tale of Snow White? Weren't the dwarves and her \\"perfection\\" enough to swallow already?<br /><br />9. If she's been locked in a tower most her life, how do all the soldiers know to yell \\"get her\\"? (Get who? never seen her before, is she new? What, I thought the princess was dead?) How come the whole castle knows who she is, but no one else does?<br /><br />10. Why, why, why , WHY the flock would you throw away your shield? WHY?!!!! If you suddenly know how to fight, you do not throw away the best thing to keep other people from using a sword on you!<br /><br />I'm going to stop here, or I will be writing all day!<br /><br />*********End spoilers************<br /><br />I think this movie is a perfect example that all the originality in Hollywood is dead and gone. It's the same garbage over and over, trying to squeeze a buck out of anything that doesn't run away fast enough. Plot holes you could drive a semi through, no research on the way things work (the Grey is a massacre of the natural order), physics has no hold on Hollywood... I can't think of any movies in the past couple of years that made me go \\"Wow, that was flocking AWESOME!\\" that didn't start out as a book or a game first*. (are TV shows done in Hollywood? Walking dead is completely engrossing. I can't get enough. {yes, WD was a comic first, but still. Spectacular acting, perfect cast, etc} Same with \\"Once Upon a Time\\", and \\"Grimm\\". Maybe Hollywood should just give everything over to whoever is responsible for awesome TV shows.)<br /><br />****Edit****<br /><br />*How did I forget \\"Tucker and Dale vs Evil\\"? That is the best original movie I have seen in years. (Avoid if you dislike gore)

B006BAEQB2|4.0|So very interesting to read about Anne, who married Richard III, especially with news of the discovery of his bones below Leicester, England this week. Another of Phillipa Gregory's great, first voice novels about the English royals, written from a woman's point of view. Anne's comments upon her husband Richard's \\"pain in his arm\\" blamed upon a curse by the current queen, makes reference to the severe scoliosis he suffered and was described as 'hunchback' by Shakespeare. Gregory truly makes history accessable and alive to her readers.

030758836X|1.0|i hated this book.  i hated the characters.  i hated the plot.  i hated the ending. i hated the writing style.  it is really rare that i cannot find anything redeeming about a book... this is one of those rare occasions.<br /><br />the characters are unlikeable - actually, that is a kind way of saying the characters that are (sort of) developed in this story are honestly the worst that humankind can offer - a sadistic, psychologically challenged (to put it mildly) woman bent on systematically destroying everyone she encounters (well, i guess everyone who can't be a pawn in her game) and a completely stupid, weak man completely ruled by fear. parents that are completely smarmy, naive, codependent and incompetent.  a police force that is equally dumb, incompetent, and predictable.  and ancillary characters that are hardly believable... because they are so cliche and, well, dumb.  are there that many stupid people concentrated in one place?  in one family? in one person's life?<br /><br />the only reasons i finished it were because (1) i didn't want the book to beat me, and (2) i had an ounce faith that this author would wrap the story up in a way that made sense.<br /><br />instead you get an ending that is honestly as unbelievable as the narrative.  do people in this world really settle for such lame existences?  who in the real world has enough time to be this crazy?  do people typically accept the fact that crazy people should and do rule their lives just because - ho-hum that crazy person is smarter than me?  do people hand over the next generation to psychopaths - because oh well, i am so powerless in all of this?<br /><br />good grief. go sell crazy somewhere else. this is one for the rubbish bin.

034580404X|5.0|I am out from work on medical leave, so decided to buy the 50 Shades Trilogy.  This book is absolutely amazing and once I start reading, I can't put the book down.  It definitely keeps my interest and helps the time pass.  I chose the free shipping option and still received the books within a few days.  The books are in very good shape and am very happy with my purchase.
B000IEXVCC|5.0|It's basically a story of 2 actresses caught in a web of love, murder, insanity and revenge, but in an era of movie twists this one is right at the top.  If you're not into confusing plot twists, skip it, but if you like the challenge of trying to keep up and figure out what's going on, this is the movie for you.  You may want to watch it twice before forming a solid opinion.
B005PK553C|4.0|I am a long time horror fan. I like this series from the \\"gotta see this one\\" straight forward title, through the twists and turns, and onto the hangers that make me want more by the end of each episode. This production has great casting with good acting and directing that does the story line justice. I'm glad I bought it. I'm looking forward to the new season. Amazon's instant viewing system makes enjoying their entertainment products a breeze.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Imperdibile! Come sempre Jack Reacher non delude le aspettative.<br />Immancabile nella vostra libreria che sia cartacea o elettronica (Kindle Version).<br />Ho prenotato in anticipo la copia e, con puntualità, Amazon mi ha recapitato automaticamente sul mio Kindle Fire l'ultimo libro del mio autore preferito nella data di uscita.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Its a great app but its not working like it use to. Please fix soon. I still give it 5 stars hoping it will get fix soon.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Season 4 was great...a lot of excitement and suspense. We couldn't wait to watch the next episode each time one ended.
B00932AA5G|5.0|The interesting thing about this movie is that it follows the book. I never thought they would put in the outhouse scene.  The book is fun.  I have enjoyed reading all of Jo Nesbo's books.  I highly recommend them.  They are amazingly inventive, literate.  The main charater, Harry Hole, is basically a mess at times.  You never know what he is going to do. There are some gruesome scenes, I tend to skip over them pretty fast.  Get the books! They are long, just stick with it.  Hope they make more films.
B00932A2MC|4.0|I figured since this did so poorly at the box office that it was going to be pretty awful. It's not going to win an Oscar but it was pretty fun to watch.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best pieces of post apocalyptic fiction I've ever read.<br /><br />I love this guy like I love PKD; he doesn't treat his readers like they are idiots, he isn't afraid to get a bit dark, and he isn't afraid of leaving a question or two unanswered to give the reader a little food for thought.<br /><br />I have a feeling Mr Howey will soon be making his way toward the top of my favorite authors list. I'd sing more praises but I gotta go, just got 'First Shift' and it is calling my name.<br /><br />Read me..... read meeeeeeeee................
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app for my kindle works great, sometimes it force closes but I can usually go back onto it.
B004UID2LC|1.0|there's something wrong with this app. every time I try to play a video it says:<br /><br />&quot;this video cannot be played outside the official youtube app&quot;<br /><br />3 things:<br /><br />one, it was working fine a few months ago so what happened?<br /><br />Two, what is the official youtube app? I am still wondering what that app is.<br /><br />three, is it a copyright issue? if it is then try to fix this<br /><br />until then, I'm giving this a one star!
B006RXPTNM|5.0|Reviewed as part of an Ethics Course project. Excellent movie with great acting. The content is serious but thought provoking.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good story line but could this girl mutter and mumble anymore?  Still, I have to have all three, just to see if she ever exclaimed, shouted, or insisted.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Wow is one word if I want to describe my feelings after finishing A Dance with Dragons!!  You get to travel with your favorite characters that you love (or love to hate) through remarkable journeys that take your breath away. Your favorite characters dissapoint you (again) with bad decisions. The characters you hated surpise you making you feeling bewildered and confused about them. You meet less recognized characters that now play important roles in the development of the story. You get to know more about different people, exotic places, and cultures; about mysterious Children of Forrest and Giants. ....and much much more. This book is almost magical. I loved it and cannot wait to see what happens in the next book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best app ever,  but beware,  you will be expanding your creativity and opening a whole new world of some of the most mind blowing ideas ever.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I really like this game. I love the fact I can play without a timer. Only problem I find is that while I use the zoom and move the screen around to search the game freaqently reads my shifting as tapping. The story itself is cute and interesting.
B008XG1X18|4.0|For the most part, this app has worked.  Sometimes it shuts off for no reason, but it comes right back up. I'm so happy to finally have this on my Kindle!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I started reading this one at the word of people around me and because I like time travel/alternate history themes so I wanted to see what King would do with one.  The book is interesting and it flows along nicely, but it doesn't seem to flow anywhere in particular.  It's a overly long homage to the world of King's childhood when everything was just better than it is now.  It's a romance novel that has a time travel sub-plot getting in its way.  The book is over 2/3 complete before we even get to the part where Lee Harvey Oswald becomes a part of the story.<br /><br />Had any author but King submitted this book to his editor, it would have been culled by several hundred pages.<br /><br />I didn't hate but book by any means, but by halfway through, I found myself wondering when the character building and back story was going to end and the plot was going to start.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Hollywood dose not make epic movies like this anymore.  This is a magnificent production.  All real...No CGI.  If you are a fan of epic features than this one should be on top of your list.  I can't wait to see it again when it is released at the theaters. I will also buy the Blu-ray and will watch it again and again.  Simply said...see this film...you would not be disappointed.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This was a great app before and I haven't paid much more than $10 on music in the past 5 months because I get most free here. Recently the app was updated and it would keep telling me to check my wifi connection. I'm on a kindle fire just so y'all know. So it won't play any of the videos and I've tried some troubleshooting. If it works, then it works but it's free so no loss if it don't.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is so fun you hafe to get it. you can get anather caricter. you can get thes thags for free.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I'am not normaly a big Stallone fan,but this movie was GREAT! Even my wife liked it. There is some bad language but mostly in one scene. I like the interplay of the characters esp. Stallone and Statham of THE TRANSPORTER. If you like knives,guns,hotrods, cool old planes and motorcycles this is your movie.There are good looking women but no nudity that I can recall. I think I would remember that LOL. This is a movie to have because of all the action actors in it. I will buy Expendables 2 when it comes out on dvd. I've already seen it. It was very very good and it will go in my collection also. THE EXPEDABLES and THE EXPENDABLES 2 are the best movies Ive seen all summer!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This was a great season also just like the others. I recommend it to anyone who has not seen season 4.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app really works. It is soothing and a great sleep aid! It is also useful when on the plane; it helps drown out all the noise.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|The Title is very misleading.  There is nothing Grey about this book. This book it Red hot and steamy.  Mr Grey is strong, straight forward almost but not quite arrogent.  Ana is the magnetic opposit, shy and unexperianced yet she can stand up for herself.  The magnetic pull between them is electric. James bravely wrote a book a topic few would have chosen. The book is so detailed, it leaves very little to the imagination.
1609611543|5.0|This book completely blew my mind. Shocking revelation of the dangers of GMO's. I get diarrhea just thinking about it !!!

B008XG1X18|4.0|I almost always have to open the app twice before it will work. The first time I bring it up, it is a white screen and times out, if I close out and try again it works fine.
B0001MLMKY|1.0|it squeaks, it feels SOOO cheap, and i just scrapped it a little and its all scratched. i feel like a b**** using that watch, i gave it to my sister and it fits perfectly on her.
B006O6EOII|5.0|Purchased for 5 year old who had issues with barbie arm/leg breaks. This doll is terrific as parts that would interfere with little hands being able to independently dress the doll snap off and back on easily. Would not recommend for under 5 year old.
B00846REIS|4.0|Right from the start it reminded me of 50 Shades!! It is still a very good book and I am waiting for the second book to come out on Kindle!!
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Bought this for my Kindle Fire HD that I just received today. Some pros and cons:<br /><br />PROS<br />-- Fits Kindle Fire HD 7\\" perfectly, and is easy to remove and install. Clips hold the device firmly in place.<br />-- Adds minimal bulk or weight to the device. There is barely any gap around the Fire, so you're only adding about a millimeter, on all three dimensions, by adding this cover.<br />-- Has an elastic strap to ensure the cover stays closed. This is a nice feature that my old Kindle Keyboard's lighted case had, and I prefer an elastic closure, if possible.<br />-- Great feel, smooth leather feels great in the hand. Inner liner is fuzzy and will protect the screen well. Love that I can get it in red, for the \\"fire\\" aspect of the Fire HD's name. :)<br />-- Stands up on its own in landscape mode (though see my concern, below).<br /><br />CONS<br />-- Case is really stiff for stand-ups; I'm sure this will work itself out, in time, and I rarely use the stand-up feature anyways.<br />-- Major issue with how you orient the Fire HD - camera-right or camera-left. Depending on orientation, you'll have partial functionality either way.<br /><br />ORIENTATION ISSUE<br />-- The issue is that, basically, you have two installation options:<br /><br />1) Camera-to-the-right: This puts the HDMI/USB on the left, and power/headphone/volume on the bottom. This allows the camera to be \\"up\\" when you stand the unit up in the case and allows for the auto-sleep to work. However, it prohibits the Fire HD from charging or displaying on HDMI when the case is closed or deployed in \\"stand mode,\\" and prohibits use of non-Bluetooth headphones while propped on lap in portrait orientation.<br />2) Camera-to-the-left: This, I believe, is the desired installation option (and is, based on Amazon's case). However, when standing the case up, it results in the camera being on the bottom, and auto-sleep will not work.<br /><br />If you look at the Amazon-branded case, it specifically uses the orientation I, personally, prefer - Camera-to-the-left. They even have special cutouts for the USB and HDMI on the right. So I believe this is the desired installation method. Yet, in this orientation, the Marware case cannot auto-sleep or stand on its own and have the camera on top.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this case for Fire HD 7\\" users. The price is much more reasonable than the stock Amazon-branded case, which I think is absolutely horrifically priced. I fail to understand how Amazon can, in good conscience, sell a technological marvel that is the Fire HD for an obscenely-low $199, and then charge 25% of the cost for a case! All of their cases are like this, which is ridiculous. Maybe they count on it, and make some of the money up on the case? :)<br /><br />---UPDATED 17-Sep-2012---<br />Updated the above due to comments on how the case does, indeed, sleep the unit if you have it in the \\"wrong\\" orientation. Thanks to Leticia for making me double check this! Lowered stars to 4 due to the no-win situation this case presents, though it's still an excellent-feeling case and a good value.rientation I, personally, prefer - Camera-to-the-left.

B0083V2VW8|4.0|Earlier this year I bought, from Amazon UK, the Universal Pictures 2011 Blu-ray of Quadrophenia - which is a genuine full 1080p transfer from film, and with almost exactly the same extra features as for their 2009 \\"2 Disc Special Edition\\" DVD. That Blu-ray provides an amazing amount of extra detail over what the DVD produced, and the audio was noticeably (but slightly) better than the DVD version (which sounded excellent). I was surprised to find a Criterion edition announced several months later, and I ordered it (from Amazon USA) for the several different extra features, and I hoped that the video and audio might even be a touch better.<br /><br />I've compared the two Blu-ray editions in an A-B test, and I believe that the Universal Blu-ray has significantly better detail. For some strange reason The Criterion edition is slightly and annoyingly zoomed, cutting away details which the Universal edition proves were clearly meant to have been seen in the widescreen frame. The Criterion video is much brighter (which is not necessarily an improvement) - and although it is slightly fuzzy, it is definitely more pristine (the Universal has a small number of barely noticeable glitches, which are not visible on the Criterion).<br /><br />I haven't heard the Criterion commentary track yet (director Franc Roddam and cinematographer Brian Tufano), but I certainly enjoyed the Universal one with Franc Roddam and actor Phil Daniels.<br /><br />The audio for both Blu-ray editions is excellent - both for the restored original stereo and for each edition's sometimes starkly different 5.1 surround options (with the Criterion having the superior edge). The answer is to ideally own both editions to enjoy the best of each. However in the UK and Australia the \\"All Regions\\" Universal edition is very cheap, and fans ought to be quite content with it - especially because the much more expensive Criterion edition is Region A locked.<br /><br />I'm very happy that one of my top five favouritefilms has been restored and preserved for future appreciation in not just one, but two excellent quality high definition editions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. not as good as the Pc version but its still very fun. if anyone has the Pc version online try joining adventurecraft.mcph.co:28136
B001CL4N68|5.0|this CD is a CLASSIC!ITs real hip hop at its finest...brings back memories... glad to have in my play list again
1594744769|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this imaginative book. Thick with fantasy, mystery and danger, this is a very fun story of twists and turns, fantastical characters and monsters lurking in the shadows. It is a story woven around bazaar and fascinating authentic photographs that feed the believability. I devoured it in 2 days (it took me this long because work, kids, and life kept interrupting.) A sequel must be coming; at least I sincerely hope so!
B00931JMRE|5.0|Had not listened to the Z men in a few years. Heard them when they came through Erie, Pa, and they still rock! This album shows they still got it! Best one in years!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love that the challenging levels give my brain a workout but also love the easier levels that are relaxing and mindless.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|Felt compelled to stop watching about 1/2-way through. Once the dwarves come out, there's no rescuing the movie. Charlize Theron does a pretty good job, but the rest of the cast are pretty wooden and boring.
B005F2BBLK|5.0|... along the lines of the old Wanrer Bros cartoons (thnk Bugs Bunny).<br />Yes, this may appeal to kids, but has the adult nuances and inuendos us old fogies like in an animated film.<br />Excellent voice characters, good editing and an age old plot make this a film well worth watching.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game it fun for everyone in the family. This game is fir the young and the adult in family.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I was ready for another good read especially after the Fifty Shades series. Was happy with the content and none of the BDSM in this book!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I got this for my HTC EVO 3d and you can. hear sound gaps when the sound loops.  Having the sound stop for even a millisecond can be distracting.  BUT the app works fantastically on my son's Samsung Galaxy Player, so I guess its a problem with HTC.<br /><br />Try the free version before you purchase the premium  just to make sure you don't have the same sound issue.  I love the variety of options!

Only reason that I did not give this a five is that I wish the neck was moveable as well as oppossed to the fixed position. But it was well worth the price.
B0091574VI|4.0|The kids loved it and so did I. A very quality video. Lots of action to keep your attention. It also has footage of the wild that I have never seen before.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Yup, a marginally managed medium sized company; sums it all up.<br /><br />On the actual review, a great cast, great acting, good editing. A really fun film to watch whether you've been there (I have the T-shirt) or just want to see what corporate life can be like. Remember, though, life is what you make of it as you'll see...<br /><br />Has anyone seen my stapler? :)
B000000OE7|5.0|I am a Queen fan from way back and am embarrassed to say that I didn't know about this album until recently. (Of course in '95 I was busy raising my kids as a single mom, so that may have had something to do with it!)<br />I had to have it and it arrived today and I have just listened to it and have to say a big thank you to Brian, Roger and John for putting this together. The feel of the music is ethereal, softer and fits the name perfectly. It was so good to hear Freddie's voice again and I feel like he came back to visit and give us more of his music as a parting gift. One of the other reviewers felt that people were giving this work 'sympathy votes' and I feel that just isn't true. Queen kept evolving and this music was a fitting last studio album with the four of them, even if Freddie wasn't there, his music was and they created a nice addition to their albums. I loved it and if you are a Queen fan from long ago or recent, you will like this. I loved \\"I was born to love you\\" and all the vocal mixes in some of the other songs also. Thank you Brian, Roger, John and of course Freddie!
0393343405|5.0|Whatever you do, don't let the pedants, jealous academics, and Christian apologists keep you from enjoying this wonderful book. Maybe the thesis is a bit overstated, but there is so much truth to discover in this ancient poem and the author's explanation of it's rediscovery. I am sure that the experts could rightfully quibble about the earthshaking impact of the poem, but the ideas are timeless and even more relevant in a world becoming more secular. The fact is that religious orthodoxy has had a negative influence on human progress while promising the myth of an afterlife. The poem reaffirms that the purpose of life is life itself, and that we need to learn to appreciate the time we have here because that's all there is. Religion celebrates an angry demanding capricious deity interpreted by intermediaries who provide the rules to unlock the mystery. For most of us, it just doesn't work. Lucretius understood.
B004SI8WX2|5.0|this book is a must read for anyone on a search for spirituality. well written, visual, cant be put down. do yourself a favor and read it over and over
0061692042|5.0|If you are looking for a fast paced narrative, full of suspense and robbers on the run (r.o.r. - okay, just made that up), then look elsewhere.<br />But if you know Ford's elegant, stripped down prose and amazing ability to capture the intricacies of human beings better than any other writer alive (stolen quote form Globe and Mail), and you have the time to immerse yourself in a slow exploration... then this book needs 6 stars, or maybe more.<br /><br />I know it won't be for everyone - and especially the dismaying amount of readers that want a narrative to drive forward - but this book will ache in my chest long after I have read it. I don't need to give away much in the plot, really there isn't much plot. In 1960, Dell Parson's parents rob a bank, he and his twin sister are set adrift. Berner, his sister, runs to California, Dell is spirited away, pre-911, to cross the border into Canada, and \\"hide-out\\" in southwestern Saskatchewan. (Right around where I was born actually). It really isn't a hiding out, but a crossing of a physical border, that parallels the metaphorical border Dell is crossing in his life.<br /><br />Sure it is a coming of age of sorts - for me it resonates best with Ford's short stories (Rock Springs) and the novella Wildlife, which also has a young person at its centre, and a shares the setting of Great Falls, Montana. It has less in common with the Bascombe books (Independence Day etc., which I have not liked as much.)<br />But it is much more than a sixteen year old crossing into adulthood. A melancholy pervades the book, at times it's almost too sad to read, as in when the siblings visit their parents in jail. Ford gets inside people, and even if you can't imagine what Dell's life would be like (ie: have never had a parent commit a criminal act and go to jail), you will recognize yourself in there, you will recognize humanity in there.<br /><br />Dell tells this story as a 66-year old man (though, this only becomes evident in scant ways, andthe voice is a teenager's, one wise beyond his years). And I can't help but think Ford is reflecting on his life through this book - he is returning to a setting from early in his career, and he is thinking about the things that led up to his life now (I think he is almost 70). As I've said, this is a sad and quiet book - but in the best sort of Wim Wenders way. I do think it will make the Pulitzer and National Book lists.<br /><br />If I have one criticism of the book, it is the use of the cliffhanger type endings in some of the chapters. As in, \\"and he knew he would never see again\\", or \\"later when he found the man dead in the room\\" (these are paraphrase samples, trying not to spoil anything - but hell, right from the beginning line you know there is a robbery and a murder). I wonder if editors told Ford, \\"You know it's beautiful and all that, but can you crank up the tension, just a bit?\\" These bits seem out of place. And I want to say, shut up unnamed editor, I am just fine with the pace. I have seen Ford in interviews, including the Colbert Report (!), himself reminding the interviewer that the book is also about robbery and murders, as if to say, \\"hey, it's not like that literary stuff that people don't read anymore.\\" Again, I say, Richard, shhh. It's fine. It's more than fine.<br /><br />I know this is a book I will read again. The controlled and elegant prose needs to be studied. The mood is not something I look forward to, but the feelings, and even the truth, that it evokes create something that I find in classic novels: at the end, I am changed.<br /><br />At this point in my life (49), I think a lot of my Saskatchewan upbringing. Incidentally, my father was a goose hunter, also born right around the setting of the novel, and these sections of the book are crystalline in their imagery. And I think of borders, what it means to cross over them, and to never return.<br />My favorite quote in the book is the narrator quoting Ruskin,<br />\\"Composition is thearrangement of unequal things.\\"<br /><br />This is what Ford does. He takes these unequal things in our lives, and he puts them into stories that tell us who we are.

B008PE9GSA|1.0|I am a die hard fan,  I own multiples of everything they have ever madefrom all albums,cds, dvds, books, shirts, hats, guitar slides, strings, you name it.  I keep hoping for something decent to come out.  This cd has nothing original, no new hooks, not even decent guitar tone, what happened to the \\"Blue Jean Blues\\" tone.  It seems that the band has disengaged and is only going through the motions.  Every song starts out vocally within the first few seconds.  The vocal growl overshadows the few trickles of potential the songs have.  Dusty plays very little that that comes through and only sings a few lines.  There is one song that had a walking bass line that got me excited until the song became boring and lost the drive that can be heard on the \\"Thank you\\" from Deguello.  The arpegiated ballad was lame and and missed the mark completely,  even \\"Rough Boys\\" was far better.  What happened to \\"Hot, Cool and Rightous\\".  The producer of this album tried to get a bit of R+B but forgot how to get punch and a pocket.  I will keep buying everything thing they produce, I will keep going to their concerts, But I put an old Luther Allison album or Howlin' on the way to work and will list to Led Belly if I want to strain to understand the lyrics.<br /><br />Billy kill the ego and play some blues.

B0072IVGZG|1.0|Not happy with purchase, seems a c.d. is missing.  There was a slot for another c.d.,  but it was empty .  Hoping to resolve this issue.....so I can change my review to a better one!
0307730697|5.0|This book is a true life event of a Seal wanting to be the best of the best. His family is going through a lot after losing this great warrior, one of God's great warrior.  Thank you for sharing this book for the world to read. R Larson: Vietnam 1968 Tet dog handler.
044024630X|4.0|I found this book very engaging. It was mysterious and many chapters did the cliffhanger thing where i wanted to keep reading.  It was what I look for in a book mystery, murder, suspense.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally. I am addicted. and now I have a real working app. love it. so fun and my son loves to help pin things he likes and this is so much easier.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very fun &amp; enjoyable.  Brings back memories when I use to play the original Nintendo games. If you grew up playing Mario than you will like this game.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|There have been several references lately to \\"The Killing Floor\\", the very first of the Reacher novels.  I thought I would re-read it and compare the Reacher of then to the Reacher of now. Truthfully, Lee Child wrote his first novel with the same flair that he exhibits today. I enjoyed the trip back in time.  This was a terrific read even for the second time!!!
B009329ZF2|1.0|This movie sucked. Big-time. Bad acting, stupid plot, and I think it is a little interesting that Hollywood always makes Aliens male and evil. Seriously, have you no imagination out there in tinsel town or has all that smog affected you ability to think in a creative, intelligent and entertaining manner. I think it has.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Excellent book, you won't regret giving it a read.  The story is well crafted with interesting characters.  Looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|The walking Dead season 2 is good but the first season was way better and really only the last episode was really any good but you have to watch at least several of the episodes to understand what is going on and what has happened i watched the whole season but really wasn't  worth it to me.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|I ordered this movie because it was shot on location where I work. Point Reyes National Seashore. The film is great fun. Each year I have a fog party and show it. The I send my guests out into the real fog. I live in the foggiest place on the west coast. Good cast.
B0064SHI9I|1.0|doesn't work with galaxy s3. customer service says it does but it doesn't. tried on 2 s3. can't backup calendar.
B008C0C1Y8|5.0|For all the people who gave this 1 or two stars and made pointless comments.....wrong !<br /><br />If you are expecting 2012 Animations and a serious and strong plot....90's movies are NOT FOR YOU.<br /><br />These are action comedies with terrible punch lines and extra cheese on top of them. This movie is as great as when I first watched it when I was 13 years old. I love it.<br /><br />If you are looking for Matrix or Minority Report or I Robot, this is not for you. If you are a fan on Stallone, if you want to remember what entertained us 20 years ago and enjoy an old school action scifi comedy, you want to get this movie !<br />I love watching old movies no matter how cheese they are just to remind me that it did not take very much to be entertained back in the day. And to see what cars clothes and hair styles people used to have is Epic hahah.<br /><br />Judge Dredd 5 star.  I care not that it's not follow the comic this is NOT the first movie to do so.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love this app! it lets you get on pinterest easily. I was orginally going to delete my account because it took a long time to log in on the web, but then i found this app and my fun begins with a touch of a button
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The series was very entertaining. I can't wait for season 3. The storyline is excellent and is very worthy of the title and place in Masterpiece Classics.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love viewing pins and boards on my kindle fire.  The screen resolution is really nice and the experience is pleasant. The app works great now. My previous review talked about how it crashed frequently on my fire. Today it worked flawlessly and I noticed there were some new capabilities, so it has apparently been updated. If you were waiting for better reviews, now you can install it. But be sure you download the official Pinterest app.
0385344333|4.0|While hitch-hiking late at night on a rural Nebraska road, Jack Reacher, is picked up by a car containing three occupants, two men and a woman. As they progress on their journey, they start to encounter police road blocks, and Reacher begins to wonder if all is as it seems, with regard to the people he is sharing the car with.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the first few hundred pages of this novel. I thought it was the best part of the story. Reacher is trying to figure out who his fellow passengers really are, at the same time, a sheriff and FBI agent are trying to piece together, the events surrounding a murder in a small Nebraska town.<br /><br />As the novel progress though, I felt the story became less intriguing, and did not hold my interest quite as much. Overall, as thrillers go, it is not too bad, and is worthy of four stars (just about!!) but as Reacher novels go it was quite poor.
B000NQRE9Q|3.0|I would give it a 5 star rating bc raiders of the lost ark is one of the best films ever made! and 2 and 3 were also very solid films, but the fourth was such a let down. Guess every good movie franchise has a dud.
B002R02FBS|5.0|For starters, this box set has the proper title of \\"Philosopher's Stone\\", rather than the US title of 'Sorcerer's Stone' (I believe this is a Canadian release) and in the extended version of the film, via ADR or an alternate take, I don't really know, every time the Stone is talked about, it's called the Philosopher's Stone by whoever is speaking. In addition to the other features of this set, this is like the icing on the cake for a detail-obsessed HP nerd like me.<br />Since everyone in the known universe has probably seen this movie, I won't go into the film all that much, beyond saying that the deleted scenes have been re-integrated into the movie much like the extended cuts of the LotR films, most of them to good effect; the scene with Neville leg-locked creates something of a redundancy with the kid's discovering Nicholas Flamel's identity on Dumbledore's Wizard Card and then again in the library, but it's forgivable.<br />In any case, this is my preferred version of the film, and I think any true HP fan will agree.
B008XG1X18|4.0|this is an enjoyable app that is close to what its like ln a computer. I would have given more stars if it wasn't necessary to click on each pic to like it.
0525478817|5.0|As usual, John Green has an uncanny knack to create characters that are so real you feel like once you close the book, you will be able to look to the seat next to you and see them there. John Green is the first author to have really made me cry, back when I first read \\"Looking for Alaska\\" about three years ago. I was determined not to let him take hold of my emotions again this time and play my heartstrings like some sort of crude pipe organ, but alas it is something that just can't be avoided. Hazel and Augustus are two people who you wish you could meet and know, and not being able to know them in real life is a feeling almost as ridiculous and futile as trying to control your destiny- but since we are all human, we try anyway.<br /><br />I read this book in less than a week. I thought I'd be able to put it down here and there to switch back to my first post-high school reading of The Great Gatsby (which I can attribute the credit of said-reading to John Green) but it just was not possible. As much as I am enjoying the story of Nick Carraway and Jay Gatsby, Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters drew me into their lives so much more fluidly and delightfully. Star-crossed and cancer-riddled, their story was one I just couldn't put on hold.
1423124111|5.0|This oversized coffee table book is chock-full of remarkable posters and graphics, has a brilliant analytical opening intro. by Tony Baxter, and has just the right amount of captions so as not to be intrusive to the art.  Simply gorgeous.  A must-have!
B0086700CM|5.0|Addicting for competitive people! Must have this game! I have played for hours on end and its still fun. good
B005NFJAT4|5.0|As a military historian whose focus is primarily the Pacific War 1941-45, I came to Gettysburg without expert knowledge of American Civil War history and how mid-nineteenth century artillery should perform in the field. Despite that flaw in my education, and a running time of 4 hours, I found this production of Gettysburg totally absorbing. The battle scenes are magnificently recreated and are not overwhelmed by top character performances from a fine ensemble cast that includes Tom Berenger, Jeff Daniels, Martin Sheen, and Sam Elliott. I still regard [[ASIN:B00004RCO8 Waterloo [Region 2]]] as the finest recreation of a great battle but the producers of that movie had the benefit of the Russian army to provide thousands of extras, and magnificent cavalry charges by actors mounted on superb horses and dressed in the colourful uniforms of the French and British cavalry in polished cuirasses and plumed helmets. I have watched Gettysburg in VHS, DVD and now Blu-Ray and I suspect that may prove how much I have enjoyed it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|most unique app;  i love that u can combine sounds and clear them in a jiffy. these are great sounds true to each unique noise.  they help me fall asleep and unwind I wish my alarm clock had all these features.
B00338QENI|4.0|I bought the Kindle version of this book and I must say, it was one of the few books that I enjoyed. The way the story was presented was great, switching back and forth from the past to the present when it was relevant and the descriptive imagery was excellent. When reading, I could crisply imagine the different scenes of the story. Finally, I could relate to the characters of the book - I felt their joy, sorrow and anger by the non-verbal cues within the text. To conclude it was a great book and I do recommend it to anyone in the field of science, sociology or just someone looking for a book to read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I can say is I am in shock n awe and I want more. Oh! I want my own fifty.
0439023521|5.0|I heard about the premise of Hunger Games long before I read it and couldn't fathom why anyone would want to read such a thing. It remained on the best-seller's list for so long I had to finally try it out. It took reading the thing to finally understand. I fell in love with it almost instantly. I was captivated. If you're on the edge, give it a shot. Kat will steal your heart away and take you on one wild journey!
B008FOB124|5.0|In the late 90s, I accepted the fact that there would never be another Dead Can Dance album.  While I enjoyed Spiritchaser,I felt it wasn't a worthy end to this incredible duo.  Anastasis ranks up there with some of their best work.  I can hear elements from all the different DCD periods here. It's as if the time never passed. Pure beauty!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I wish when I got to the bottom of the page I could load more pins. But I do like the search options.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! It was hard to put down, I read it in one weekend, I also suggest you read it before you see the movie. Working on the next book.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I found this to be very helpful while I was finalizing my manuscript for publishing on Kindle. The information is basic and good for someone publishing for the first time on Kindle.  I followed the instructions for preparing the manuscript and had no problems with formatting etc. The book looked good in the preview immediately. I shall refer to it again as I prepare my next book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|after reading the first two books i am not going to read the last one.  i love sex and i am definately not a prude but the desriptive sex is just the same thing over and over again..like having the same desert all the time with no other foods to eat..i prefer a book that also has some story line not just a sex line.. i wish i had not purchased them, a waste of money, i just bought into the hype..shame on me.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Clasic in the series, Reacher being the loan ranger again and following his nose to meet up with a woman with a nice voice (see earlier novel)<br />What else would you do if you were Reacher?
B005L12SH6|5.0|A BRILLIANT COLLECTION OF EW&F ALBUMS.<br />EVERYTHING YOU WANT AND NEARLY EVERYTHING YOU NEED BUT SADLY NO BONUS TRACKS.<br />THE CD REISSUES FROM A FEW YEARS AGO HAD PLENTY.<br />WARRNING IMPORTING EXPENSIVE GOODS COSTS A LOT.<br />I HAD TO PAY £18 CUSTOMS AND POST OFFICE CHARGES.<br />IT WAS WORTH IT TO OWN THIS 5 STAR COLLECTION.
B008XG1X18|4.0|would give 5 stars if there were less repeating. learning lots of really cool DIY home projects, however. The gardening section is really cool
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Inspirational story.  No one is perfect and no one can judge.  Incredible how he defeated the odds against him to triumph and become a warrior and a hero.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Just love Dexter. Video quality was very good. Hope there are more episodes. Please let me know as soon a the next one becomes available. Pat Western Australia
B004T4LUPW|5.0|It does exactly what I need. It's reliable & very functional. I would be lost without it - it's on my iPhone, kindle & iPod. Always available!
B004X4QW42|5.0|Very good movie just as intriguing as the first and the fight sequences were excellent. Highly recommend. Was not what the first movie was but what sequel is, still a must see for all martial arts fans.......
0441013597|5.0|In a world all its own, with very original names, characters and places, the reader is sure to be awakened to an adventure rarely put into words.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Do not miss the opportunity to read this book. (The whole series for that matter) It grabs you at chapter one and doesn't let you go until the end of the very last book! It is even a series that you can read over and over and never get tired of it! I recommend this series to everyone!
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I don't know why it took me so long to watch this movie and this is coming from a huge batman fan. I don't know maybe I thought no one can compare to the Michael Keaton/Jack Nicholson duo. But boy was I wrong Christian Bale/Heath Leger was a knock out performance.I hate that they just left him dangling there toward the end I really wanted him to fall to his death like the first joker but maybe he was suppose to be in the sequel but since Heath's unfortunate death, that wasn't the case. Overall good movie.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|great mind game to keep you thinking<br />I  can't put this game down cuz I want to see what's next.
B00008PW2D|5.0|My wife is a huge fan of this series and somehow this season went missing. So ordered replacement only to find a week later. That aside very good show highly recommend.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|This is a great game. Has great graphics. I rate this game a must buy.And the best part is its free!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book by a fantastic author. I love Suzanne Collin's work! I will definitely be reading more of her work in the near future
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|This series just rocks, even if your not into zombies the human story is well worth watching,<br /><br />Was VERY disapointed that The Talking Dead was not included in the special features, to see the talking dead after every episode you have to log in to Youtube do a search for Talking dead and it should lead you to the AMC talking dead episodes.<br /><br />its a big inconvenience but if you love this show and have to see all the extra's im sure you will do this lol.<br /><br />So 4 out of 5 because the Talking dead is not on the disk.
B00136Q1I0|5.0|I'm going to see Bruce Springsteen in concert in Nov. and wanted to get pumped up with his greatest hits before I see him in person.  This is the CD to give you a great rush of his vast career of music.  Now I can't wait to see him live!
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|This being a prequel I had very low expectations , but being a big IP Man fan I wanted to see and was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this film and actors. Fight sequences were great and storyline fantastic. The actor that played lead is a fantastic actor and martial artist as good as Donnie yen. Definitely looks like a younger version of him. This is a must have film for martial arts fans. Highly recommend. Small piece of trivia The real IP Mans son has a role in this film.
0307887448|5.0|I loved this book! Brilliant from start to finish. Almost perfect. Of course I might be biased as I was born in 1974 and this book revolves around everything I held dear back in the 80s. Can't wait for another book by the author!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the second book of one of the best series of books that I have ever read. I am looking forward to reading more books by Suzanne Collins in the future
B002M2T1UO|5.0|A friend of mine who is a retired police officer told me about this series. He loved it, and now so do I. The acting is superb, and the action is non-stop. The characters and story lines are so well developed that you can't always tell whats coming next. The whole series really makes you think about good & evil in all of us. Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed \\"The Wire\\" and/or \\"Breaking Bad\\".
B008XG1X18|5.0|So glad Pinterest finally has a Droid/Kindle app! Has worked perfectly for me thus far. Easy to navigate &amp; love having Pinterest on the go.
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|This is Kevin costners best film besides dances with wolves. This movie will defiantly open your eyes. Very well made and the cast is perfect. This is a must own film . The directors cut is the one to buy. Could watch this movie a hundred times and never lose interest and each time you will pick up more and more out of this film. Greatttttttttt
B0086PGCHQ|5.0|I think this is Pat's best album since the Group's The Way Up. Chris Potter is a great addition to Pat's band- he is awesome on sax and other wind instruments. Antonio Sanchez and Ben Williams are also terrific musicians. Just an awesome quartet. Saw them live as well- if you're a Metheny fan, and can see them live, don't miss it.
B007KCG7MQ|3.0|Joe Walsh's latest is a solid release. It's always interesting to see what an aging rocker like Joe will put out after being in the business for as long as he has. A lot of people look to these artists to do the big \\"sell out\\", which he really has not done. Joe sounds like Joe on Analog Man. He's not trying to sound like the Eagles or the James Gang. The track Funk 50 does bring back some good memories but he should have opted for a more original song. Over all it's a solid package from a man who seems to be happy with where he is at this time in his life. The Jeff Lynne production work is as good as he has done with other acts. The guitar work is fine and the tracks that I'm digging on the release are Analog Man and One Day At A Time.
B00931JMRE|2.0|FWIW, I'm a huge ZZ Top fan. Own every album they put out; can play about half their songs on guitar.<br /><br />This album is not a ZZ Top album. The production quality is terrible, almost as if loudness is the most important thing and the music itself is not secondary, but maybe a distant tenth.<br />The Rev's guitar tone sounds more like Green Day. The drums and bass plod along (no \\"pocket\\", no \\"punch\\"). The only song with some groove is Chartreuse. The rest are just - blah.<br /><br />Why?!<br /><br />(Yes, I know that most not-glowing reviews, this is going to get voted down)
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Such a great series a must have for all zombie fans. This is one of the best new series out since justified. The blu ray looks excellent in HD
145162607X|4.0|\\"I think of Elizabeth Woodville, who has been the bane of my days and the murderer of my sister... \\"I have a greater claim to the throne than her.  I shall be, as I was supposed to be, Queen Anne of England.\\"<br /><br />This is the next installment in Philippa Gregory's covering of the War of the Roses. As always it is really well researched, and mixes just enough fact with fiction to be a really entertaining read.<br /><br />This book follows the life of Anne Neville: daughter to the Kingmaker the Earl of Warwick, wife to a rebellious prince, duchess to the brother of a King, and eventually Queen of England. Anne is not a very prominent figure in history, however Gregory manages to pull enough together of her life to make her past come alive. While a lot of this book is probably speculation, and is most likely not historically accurate as to the level of participation Anne had in these events, it does give a pretty accurate picture overall of what was happening during this time.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of the other books in this series (The White Queen, The Red Queen, Lady of the Rivers) you can still pick this book up and read it as a standalone novel. It will read just like any other Philippa Gregory novel in that sense. There are a couple allusions to the previous novels she makes but they are so small that only someone who has read all the books will catch on to them.<br /><br />For those who have been following the series, I think you will find this book a very interesting addition. In most of the novels up to now we have seen Elizabeth Woodville as a good character, or at the very least pretty neutral. This book decidedly makes her a villain. From Anne's point of view Elizabeth and the York court become centers of intrigue and plot. Every story we have read up until now gets turned on it's head and examined from the other side. I found I quite enjoyed it even if there were some events that were repetitive from other books.<br /><br />Overall I would suggest checking out this series. It is by far better than the Tudor series in my opinion, and provides a rich story surrounding the turmoil of England during this series of wars. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the White Princess to finish out the Plantagenet writing for these amazing and influential women of history.<br /><br />This review also seen on the Caffeinated Booker.
B0098A1TEE|5.0|I absolutely love her music.It is a shame that she's not so popular in America , as she is in the Netherlands. Her music is jazzy,easy listening,fun innovative,simply absolutely awesome,you should give it a try. I'm in love with her music. Also ,she's not the typical singer, she's so different in so many ways. I'm super happy to write about her, because when she becomes famous in America ,I would be one of her first fans lol :p even though I was surprised there weren't  reviews about her music. Anyway give it a try and enjoy. Greetings from somewhere in the U.S .<br /><br />Caro Emerald, I Love your music & admire u, keep it up  :)<br /><br />P.S I hope she gets to read my review , one of these days, everything is possible hihihihi :p
B0091REZMW|5.0|I cant put this down this is one of the best games ive found so far to play on my kindle fire
1615243496|5.0|I have read \\"FRANKENSTEIN\\" before and suggest that anyone who judges the story by the movies do the same. I bought this book to display in my collection. It looks new. It smells new. It is quite a nice looking book. Yes, I did have to read it. If you've never read it-you DON'T know the story at all.
B0040JHLI6|5.0|I was able to get rid of my Super Feet inserts because of the great support that this shoe provides.  Consisent, true sizing.  Good selection of colors.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Though ridiculous at every tun it is completely entertaining.  The gratuitous violence is really a treat.  You will have to watch it to see what I mean.  What a hoot!
B008EKON56|5.0|This is an excellent upgrade if you are using your iPad with an external amplifier. I have a Ray Samuels Hornet external amp and used to use it with the headphone out on the iPad 2. After adding this dock the sound is substantially improved. It outputs a stronger line out than the headphone out which means my amp does not have to be at high volume levels to sound entertaining. The sound is more balanced, cleaner and the soundstage is larger. This is a definite upgrade over the headphone out. I had tried the soundstation dock, though with another setup and I think that the Fiio is a better sounding dock. Buy this and there is no looking back!
B001IF252M|3.0|Just to reiterate, this adapter is expensive, but it's well worth the money. I love being able to stream movies and shows from my laptop to my projector. All I am missing is some speakers and wah-lah I'll have my own home theatre!
B002ZG999U|3.0|didn't rate the sales hype from the movie maker it was alright, but.....hopefully they will keep trying to improve the subject matter
0553093029|4.0|My son LOVES all things Star Wars (among other movies franchises) I get depressed buying LEGOS and toy type gifts for Christmas birthdays etc...since I know in the long run the pieces will be lost and ultimately most will be sold for pennies on the dollar at a garage sale.  I love the nice coffee table books that Lucas has added.  They are beautifully photographed and well done in terms of content...He loves to look through (and read!!) the books and in 20 years he will still have them to set out on his coffee table...a memory of childhood without looking like a complete toy geek!  hahah...if you like this check out STAR WARS YEAR BY YEAR A VISUAL CHRONICLE...(my newest purchase for him which is in hiding til Christmas)this is the ULTIMATE fan book(I'd give it 5 stars)...it takes you from the making of the movies and includes everything EVERY actor did after Star Wars year by year,, toys marketed and years they came out...so if you collect toys you can search the book and find just about every piece of marketing every produced related to the franchise. The Illustrated Star Wars Universe is a great book overall...but if you are only buying one...get the year by year visual chronicle:)
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Once again Lee Childs shows he is a master at weaving a great story and keeps us intrigued from start to finish, Can't wait for the next book
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Lee Child is a master in slowly unfolding suspence in his novels. A Wanted Man is a sequel to where the previous novel ended, and you can feel Jack Reacher get into trouble bij stepping into the wrong car. When the two storylines meet eachother, it is a guarantee for great action! I haven't finished the book yet but it gets five stars from me already! Although I'm Dutch, i couldn't wait for the dutch version and even so shouldn't you wait buying A Wanted Man and step into the world of Jack Reacher! You will get addicted too!!
B004UID2LC|2.0|This app used to work great, but I installed the last couple of updates and now it does nothing. Playback errors. Download in all formats says &quot;searching...&quot; and then nothing happens. No error message or anything. Just nothing downloads. SGS2 ICS
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love Plants vs Zombies and it works great on the kindle fire.  It could be improved by having the full PC version,  but for the price, I can't complain.  I love it!
B0058PJ6NE|2.0|this app was great at first, but now it wont let me view or download anything.it only worked for about a month.I had purchased for use on kindle fire.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Well, I got this and I really loved it, but for some reason it won't download anything anymore. So if this is also another person's problem too then I would love for it to be fixed. All in all it was a great app before it stopped downloading on me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it! Fun informative interesting hours of tips and ideas! its a must try!  the only complaint would be from my family... I can spend too much time looking.
0345803485|5.0|I just finished reading the book.  I had several people tell me that the book sucked.  I believe when a person decides to read this book they must have an open mind.  The book is romantic and erotic, with a message...Good book.  On to the next one.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The Walking Dead is a great TV series that has a lot of people literally hooked to it. Featuring former police officer \\"Rick\\" as the leader of a small group in a world that is infested with zombies after he first wakes up from a coma in season 1. Rick has come a long way now and has survived the impossible by using strategic plans and some crazy ideas. Rick is not alone in this horrific world. He is with his wife and son and he must protect them from the dangers that have elimnated most of the human race. I personally started watching the Walking Dead the day that it aired on AMC and it was so amazing I just had to keep watching. If there is one show that will get you hooked, it's definitely this one. Zombie lovers are going to absolutely enjoy every single episode from season 1 to season 2. With season 3 fastly approaching this October 2012 I would recommend you to catch up until the last episode of season 2 if you haven't done so already. Overall this a great TV series that is sure to last long since it has so many fans! The grand finale of season 2 was just shocking! It was filled with action and tons of zombies from the firist couple of minutes. This isn't like your everyday zombie movie... No... this is way better than any old movie, because this is The Walking Dead. The most suspenseful, thrilling, and extraordinary tv show that have ever seen! I hope this review helped you out on deciding to watch or not to watch the Waking Dead!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the series as a whole especially Mocking Jay.  The oblu thing it could of done for me was provided a little more info on Gale at the end of the book.  There were definitely a lot of twist and turns I did not see coming...I was left wondering what book I could read next that would even compare
B00881VLCE|2.0|This game is actually really good.  Actual jigsaw pieces and a lot of puzzles to choose from.  Unfortunately, the game has something wrong with it.  I have a lot of issues with freezing and the game deletes any puzzles I already have anytime I go to download more.  The Rapunzil (spelling?) puzzle set shuts the game down completely.  It helps to uninstall and try again but, no matter what, it always ends up doing the same thing (I've tried Many times).  This game has Great potential but, until it gets fixed, I cannot recommend it.
006198969X|4.0|i think that every girl should buy this book cause its excelent  for improving your style and becoming a better you!!!
098555780X|5.0|Honestly, this book is flat out amazing! I've been following J.D. and his videos for a long time. He always gives incredibly easy to follow instructions in all of his works. This book is no exception. If you have even seen any of his videos you know how easy the instructions are to follow. This book makes it even easier! I cannot wait for the future volumes of this series. If you want one book that sums up the best of paracord ties this is it!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love using this bible online. I can highlight verses, add notes, read multiple translations side-by-side, etc. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 is that I cannot use it offline on a Chromebook.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|says incorrect password. will not open. very disappointed in this app. really wanted to use it because I use ebay a lot. wish it would open.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I ordered the super ear for my 94 year old mother.  She is in therapy and she wears the ears over her hearing aids.  She now hears the therapist clearly and can follow her instruction!  The therapist said she will order this product and take it to sessions for her hard of hearing clients.  Small, light weight, affordable, and best of all, it works!

0786915749|4.0|I don't read alot of fantasy but my son said he thought I'd like it. To my surprise I did! It reminded me very much of Tolkien (who I do love). The characters were endearing. The story intersting and well written. To those who may be put off because it is associated with Dungeons and Dragons I say, forget about it. It's a good book - can't wait to read the 2nd volume.
B005LAIHGI|3.0|this movie realy sucks it makes no seanc its crazy money maker for fill makers hers my thots on the fillem thar are a lote of money making films out ther to maney.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|yippie!!!!  .I love this game when was a kid and I love it now!<br /> total 5 stars its awesomeness fun for anyone!
B007X15GRQ|3.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This film has an excellent premise and good acting from everyone, particularly Mark Wahlberg & a sorely underused Kate Beckinsale. An excellent premise and good acting are two key ingredients for a great steak, movie-wise. However, this one is undercooked in the relationship area between Kate and her little brother. I never got the impression that she loved him, apart from one line early in the film. And why do writers feel that it's okay to combine God's Name with a mild curse word, thereby turning it into a strong profanity? That's also another reason I gave this film 3 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Rated R (strong language & violence and brief drug use).
0307891372|5.0|I am really bad at Skyrim.  This guide has helped so much.  I still die alot becuase I am having trouble getting the controls switched over in my mind from Dragon Age to this, but that is becuase I am neurotic and does not reflect the awesomeness of the game, or this guide.  And it comes with an awesome map.  If you like Skyrim and you want to get the most out of your gaming experience, be sure to get this, it is great.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really enjoy this series. Get a bit frustrated at times with the characters and all their self-inflicted troubles, but I guess that's what moves the story on. Look forward to season three.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|I laughed through this whole movie but was disappointing in the ending it had. It felt like it was missing an ending but it may have just been me. However the company did what it promised when it came to shipping and mailing it to my house so i wont mark it down because of that. Overall I did enjoy the movie but might plan on watching a film before buying it.
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|I loved my purchase.  Great price for what the product was, CD and DVD!!  Saw Richard in concert and the CD was almost as good as seeing him in person. It shipped fast and in perfect condition!  Thanks!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I got this because my grandson loves bubbles and fish. Not only does he enjoy it, I get a kick out of playing it with him. He is 19 months old, so it helps him learn the skill of touching a moving object for actions.<br />Highly recommend for very young kids.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Always a hit.  The rules don't change, everyone can play.  It doesn't matter if you win or lose.  What's else is there to say?

1451673442|5.0|Where do I begin? The meditations in her book helped me to achieve my life-long dream of writing with[[ASIN:B00994A66Q The Little Book of Breakthrough: Breakthrough Thoughts for Manifesting Your Heaven on Earth]]!<br /><br />The Secret opened my eyes, the Power opened my heart, but the Magic opened a new world to me I never knew existed. My life began to immediately improve with the Magic and as a result I finally began to understand my life's purpose. I finally understood The Great Secret to Life! The Magic makes it crystal clear how to succeed in life.<br /><br />The Good<br />The tone is perfect-compassionate and warm. The practices in the book span every area of life and can be immediately applied. I have given this book as gifts several times because it is so easy to relate to anyone's circumstances.<br /><br />Needs Improvement<br />I think the book can be somewhat overwhelming for someone that doesn't have a deep understanding of the Law of Attraction. I think this book is for the advanced, spiritually enlightened individual. Also because of the length of each meditation it may seem a little too long for some people that are on-the-go.<br /><br />Despite this drawback, I highly recommend reading this book. I believe regardless of your level in life, you can learn something that will create a breakthrough. It helped me realize my dream of being an author and I know it's helped countless others achieve their lifelong dreams as well.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Simple and informative.Requires no upkeep and is always on the job. I wish there were more apps of this type.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|Download this app. Now. It works much better than any other app I've used to play lullabies or white noise for my and my son's naptime. The customization took me by surprise.

B00632HWOG|5.0|Love this app . My yahoo that I can take anywhere and have. Can check all my e-mails and it alerts me to new e-mails.
030758836X|3.0|This book almost got tossed into the library donation box, it definitely violates my 50-page rule. There was almost nothing to interest me in the first person narratives of two self-centered hipsters recounting the decay of their marriage... except that their stories were so strikingly dissimilar.<br /><br />After \\"the thing\\" is revealed, the action does pick up, and (I don't want to admit it) I kept reading straight through to the end in one sitting. It was not a satisfying read, more like looking at a titillating story on a gossip web site - a feeling which was strongly reinforced by the lackluster ending.<br /><br />Snark Alert! I'm hoping the screenwriters will do a Grisham on it and come up with a better ending for the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellently written, this is a must-read for lovers of dystopian society.  See the world of District 12 and the Capitol through Katniss' eyes, and join her in the fight for her life and the honor of her district.
B0086700CM|4.0|its fun until you start playing it over and over then it gets extremely boring if you want it to stay exciting then just play the game once a day.
B005HV6Y84|1.0|I was excited to get this soundtrack because the previous 3 were fantastic!  This compilation wasn't up to par.  I previewed the tracks on amazon and gave it a shot anyway... wish I didn't.<br /><br />The shipping and condition were great as always.
B005NA3B8U|5.0|This is a great old school game. A little different getting used to playing it on a touchscreen, but still a great game!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was awesome. Very well detailed and kept you trapped at all times. The story of the games, how the districts are divided and how a government's way of leading those districts to their benefit is close to what we live now a days but more civilized. If wars continue on, humanity destroying each other, and the need for power increases, we might be closed to a hunger games ourselves.
B008MEM24S|5.0|If you like &quot;Where's my water &quot; you will like where's my Perry. to me, seems a little easier than the original but I was challenged on a few tough levels. It is a great game.

B000ICLRIE|5.0|Simply put this film is one of the best.  The acting, the filming, the music is incredible.  I highly suggest that you see it if you have not already.  I agree with several others here in that I am amazed that it did not do much better when it was in the theaters.
B006RNHFI4|5.0|I had seen a family member's copy of this book and decided I just had to have it!..!  I am not disappointed.  I discovered why some of my game characters had certain items available while others did not, even during the same quest.<br /><br />The maps, quest lists, bonus items (from quest completion), and characters availible for interaction is really superb.<br /><br />I have had a couple Internet downloads to update my game.  This may be why I have actually found a character not even listed in the book index!  But I have logged more than 3,000 hours in the game.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|We have a small \\"owners\\" closet in a beach house that we rent out.  There is no electricity in this closet and I ordered this little motion activated light to have in the closet.<br /><br />It works great,  When you open the closet door, it comes on and stays on while you ar elooking for something in the closet.  It is not as bright as a real light bulb but it does everything i expected it to do.<br /><br />I will see how the battery life goes.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I'm new to Downton Abbey.  I purchased Season 1 and immediately after ordered Season 2.  I just love, love, love this series and can't wait for Season 3.  This order included the Christmas Special...a must to see!!

B00000272N|4.0|This is a mandatory cd to have in grunge lover's CD collection. I was excited to listen to this CD! However a few songs aren't to my liking but that's with every CD so there isn't a down side to this album.<br />Go Alice In Chains!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I'm usually not a fan of mystery/thriller books. But I thought this novel would deal more with the main character's conflicts between objectivity as an attorney and unconditional fatherly support for his teenage son. However, this conflict was lacking in the main character. He was very one-sided. I think it would have been more interesting to focus on the mother of the accused teenager as she was experiencing this conflict. She appeared to be undergoing all the emotional and mental struggles of the case. The ending was very disappointing. It was abrupt and cheesy. I could almost envision myself watching a bad movie as I was reading that part.
1419702203|5.0|Great pictures I have never seen before, of one of my heroes
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|The Elite Hail-Fire is an amazing Nerf Blaster.  It's smaller than it looks, making the gun much more compact than a Vulcan, and shorter than a Stampede. It uses the same flywheel found in a Barricade, although has a little bit more voltage power because the Hail-Fire uses 4 \\"AA\\" batteries instead of the 3 you use in a Barricade.<br /><br />The blaster uses the same clips as a Stampede but comes with 4 slightly re-designed clips - one side is translucent so it's much easier to tell how many shots you have in the clip. These newer clips are fully compatible with other clip-based blasters. The translucent side helps takes the guessing out of reloading, and is a welcome addition. Another upgrade is the clear jam door located on the top of the Hail-fire - you're able to see down into the barrel if a dart gets stuck.<br /><br />The Hail-fire is much lighter than a Vulcan or Stampede because you don't have 6 \\"D\\" Batteries and the smaller profile of the blaster makes it weigh less, but it does get heavy if you fully load it with 8 18-dart clips. I guess if you're going for full capacity though, you're less worried about accuracy.mobility and more concerned with suppressing fire, which the Hail-fire excels at better than even a Vulcan.<br /><br />Reloading is a breeze, as is advancing to the next clip. A quick flick and you've got 6, 12, 18 or 35 darts ready to go depending on your load out. The blaster only comes with 4 6-dart clips, but I think that helps keep the price to under $40. You can purchase additional clips.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with the Hail-fire is that there are not as many tactical rails compared to some other blasters<br /><br />Overall, this has quickly become my favorite Nerf blaster due to it's outstanding versatility, power, design, and fun.
B004P5RMZ2|5.0|I saw \\"Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii\\" almost 40 years ago, and not since, and I wanted to see it again.<br /><br />Well, here it is.  The transfer is very good; I couldn't detect any artifacts (or, for<br />that matter, anything that would tell me this was *film* that was close to a half<br />a century old).  The colors were still solid and crisp, no scratches, no dust<br />marks (that I noticed, at least).<br /><br />If you're a PF fan, you won't be disappointed.  If you're not a PF fan, then you<br />should start with their better known works (like Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall)<br />and work *backward* in time from there.  Then, when you start hearing about Syd<br />Barrett, you are ready for this movie.<br /><br />  - Bill
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|My husband and I loved the movie the Descendants and really enjoy the calming music from the movie sound track.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was the best book that I have read for a long time. I loved the way the author wove the 3 time frames into the plot. I could not put it down. I had to find our what was happening with the characters. I found myself wanting to talk to myself about what was happening and why. I will definitely read other books by Kate Morton.
B004LROUW2|1.0|It's taken me a long time to come around to write this review not only because I hesitate to denigrate any book, but because I get creeped out every time I think about 1q84.  Not only is it too long (the author repeats himself endlessly) but it is a truly terrible read.  Save your money.

145210655X|5.0|What if Luke had grown up as Vader with his active father.  Would they get along?  Would Lord Vader make a good father?  Would they rule the galaxy as Father and Son?  THIS book answers those burning questions!  No, really, it does...
0143119680|1.0|I will confess immediately that I did not finish this book.  Actually, I never even came CLOSE to finishing.  I listened to this on my work commutes through Audiobook, and after  about 6 hours  ( Chapter 10)  of listening to nothing happening except the main character finding a book, rowing on the river, and attending a yoga class, I had just about enough of this yawn-fest.  The main character is in rampant denial of her heritage as a witch, and whines constantly about how she can \\"take care of herself\\" without knowing even the most basic defensive spell. Nor does she practice any safety habits at all, instead she runs out in the middle of the night to row on the river alone!  The protagonist is extremely dislikable, and the pacing of the book moves along at a snails pace.<br />What a waste of time.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Excellent brainstorming software.  The program is just the right size to record thoughts on the go.  I would recommend this product.
030758836X|5.0|I just finished reading Gone Girl and this is one of the best book that i have read in a long time.  The author masterfully took me inside the dark side of not just a marriage, but human behavior, as well. The beginning of the novel was somewhat slow, but I am so glad that I kept going because this story is amazing and it unfolds in a very suspenseful and inventive manner. This is the first novel that I have read by this author, but it will not be the last.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|This is a rather simple puzzle game, in which the goal is to roll a small steel ball along a series of tracks and obstacles from a starting point to the finish line.  There are 5 checkpoints along the way, which you can enjoy independently as slightly shorter puzzles.  While it may look like a maze, it's really not very maze-like, in that there is really only a single track to follow, with each platform numbered in the order in which it is meant to be traversed.  The challenge is in navigating the platforms themselves, with their numerous obstacles, pitfalls, and precarious drops.<br /><br />If you've used the Perplexus Maze and are ready to move up in difficulty, this is the next level.  This puzzle is substantially more difficult than the easier incarnations (the Perplexus Maze and Perplexus Rookie).  I question the manufacturer's age recommendation of ages 6-12 on this product, I personally would qualify it as for ages 10-Adult.  While this product is likely perfectly safe and usable by a 6yr-old, I question that they would have the stamina and motivation to play with and solve the puzzle as it's intended to be solved.  Every adult that I've showed this to, however, can't resist picking it up and giving it a try (I have yet to observe someone succeed in navigating the puzzle from start to finish).  For anyone really, I would highly recommend starting with one of the easier models (Perplexus Maze or Rookie), and move up to this one once you're ready for a greater challenge.  Most adults will find the Perplexus Maze equally engaging, while not quite as frustrating to solve.  While more challenging, this version is equally addictive.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite books! Dan Brown is the man. I almost want to re-read it I thought it was that good.
B000079BBT|5.0|Even you even feel the hint of the blues, put on Enrique.  This album (and any other) is sure to help you bring sexy back.
0143034901|4.0|Though I have read a mystery here and there, they have never been my favorite genre, which is why this book took me by surprise. I like historical fiction and often say that when I open a book, I want to be taken to a place and time that I cannot physically visit. The Shadow of the Wind did that and more.<br /><br />This multi-layered mystery begins in 1945 Barcelona, Spain. An antique book dealer, who mourns the loss of his wife, takes his young son, Daniel, to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Daniel chooses a book entitled The Shadow of the Wind. He loves the book and begins to search for others by the same author. A search that proves futile but ignites an interest in the author.<br /><br />This could also be called a coming of age story because as Daniel experiences all the nuances of growing into an adult male, he is consumed with unfolding the mystery of the author, Julian Carax, and why his books are being destroyed. This is not one of those mysteries in which the reader can guess who is or is not the villain. I was continuously surprised by the twist and turns of the novel.<br /><br />In Daniel's quest to solve the mystery, we are taken back to turn of the century Barcelona and the aftermath of a civil war. The proses are poetic and move fluently.  This was an absolutely great read, beautifully written and captivating from the very first page. I couldn't put it down.

0143113100|5.0|This is an excellent book which tells the history behind how scientist thought our brain worked not long go and how it is now proven it really does. It's told in such a way that is easy to read and understand. It is also full of stories of  individuals who used the concept of brain plasticity (the ability to change itself) to make unbelievable improvements in their lives. We are talking people with major brain problems such as the woman who had a condition that would even allow her to walk across a room without falling over.  It details the scientist and his research who created the phrase \\"Cells that fire together, wire together\\"  (If you thought that was just metaphysical mumbo-jumbo from The Secret you learn quite differently.)<br /><br />Some of the most fascinating research has to do with phantom limbs where people who have lost extremities still feel the limb is there, have pain in it and can even feel it moving. It tells you just why that is.<br /><br />It also proves that we do indeed create our health, lives and view of the world  with our thoughts, explaining in easy to understand ways (again with the science behind it) as to why its so hard to stop certain habits and ways of thinking and then illustrates though personal studies that it is indeed possible to do so. The results are no less than miraculous. Its all a matter of rewiring our brain and changing how our neurons fire... and we as individuals completely control that.  Pretty self-empowering.<br /><br />As is with much of science they used animals to test the theories of brain mapping and understanding plasticity. They detail some of these experiments which can be pretty disturbing depending on your view of that topic. So FYI. It does not however diminish the scientific facts given.<br /><br />Nancy
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm not a native English speaker so maybe my opinion in this matter maybe not 100% relevant to everyone but I must say that this was the best written indie book I have read. I often find other books in the same price range very amateurish but this one...I just kept reading and not at once I felt stupid for reading it :)<br />Nice book, nice story, nice mystery. Great book overall, for the price you are paying.
B008B0QH5S|4.0|I've been listening to this disc since it came out a few days ago - I find it a wonderful, melodic, and mature work - distinctly from the Pet Shop Boys. Andrew Sullivan, in his brilliant socio-political blog The Dish turned me on to PSB several years ago. Since that time, I've purchased virtually every disc they have released, and built up quite a PSB library. I print his recent comments/review of Elysium in its entirety. Sully nails it:<br /><br />\\"I've been listening to Elysium for a few days now. It's a dreamy meditation on life and death and time. The track Invisible is technically peerless and emotionally wrenching, if you're headed into middle age. The lyrics to \\"Your Early Stuff\\" are hilarious, if you've ever had a long career in something. The LA lounge-sound is both new and yet very PSB.<br /><br />But the song above, \\"Leaving,\\" has really stayed with me. It couples with \\"Breathing Space\\" for me as the highlight of the album. Maybe it's the time of year as the Cape light intensifies and the beaches empty and the dusk turns the tide into purple lava, and shops empty and restaurants close and \\"leaving\\" looms. Maybe it's because we're also leaving DC for the coming year to try living in New York City (for Aaron's career and my proximity to the Beast and the Dish team). But the melancholy and hope of autumn find an elegant, calming balance in this latest album. It has made me suddenly very sad at times as I bike through the dunes listening; and also, for longer periods, oddly joyous.<br /><br />Most of all, the atmosphere of the album felt like home - this little home on my romanticized, elysian sandbar I return to and won't leave summer after summer, reaching forward for something I will never grasp, escaping somewhere for nowhere, wading in the tidal pools and watching the sun change the colors around me and feeling the moon pull the water past me:<br /><br />There's a place beyond this world<br />Where the mountains meet the sky<br />It's a different state of mind<br />Like a dream where you can fly<br /><br />Can I tell you this in confidence?<br />I need to regain that old innocence<br />I stop for some breathing space<br />Divert from the public place<br />Return to a private place<br />I know it's there just in case<br />I gotta get out<br />I gotta get out<br /><br />And now I must leave.\\"f mind<br />Like a dream where you can fly<br /><br />Can I tell you this in confidence?<br />I need to regain that old innocence<br />I stop for some breathing space<br />Divert from the public place<br />Return to a private place<br />I know it's there just in case<br />I gotta get out<br />I gotta get out<br /><br />And now I must leave.\\"
B004LROUNG|4.0|The story is intriguing and exciting. Hard to put the book down. But then...<br /><br />Reminds me a little bit about one of the first stories I wrote as home work at school when I was about 10. I started out with the intention of writing a very long and interesting story, with lots of details. Then, after quite a few pages, I grew tired of it all and rushed to the end. Admittedly, even the first parts of my story comes nowhere near the suspense and excitement in Mr. Grishams story, but I get the feeling that Mr. Grisham after some time simply decided it was time to end the novel and move on, and I was a bit disappointed.<br /><br />However, the first 90 % of the novel are, as always in the case of Mr. Grisham's novels, highly readable and very intriguing, and reading it is recommended even if the ending is a bit sudden.

B008RJFRTK|3.0|August 25, 2014  (try the lite, consider the pro)  The version availale at the time of the original review (below) listed a few cons of the paid version which I believe are no longer an issue in the latest version.  The developer has done a superb job of listening to the needs of it's users and for this alone derseves a bump in the rating.  When I get some time I'll review the updated app and revise the review.    September 13, 2012  (stick with the lite version)  pros: the mapswithme is a great offline map app.  the rendering and response of the map display is easy to read and browse. the map files dont take up too much space.  its like having a really nice paper atlas on hand. cons: there isn't yet a way to manually save or bookmark a location.  the search capability provided by the pro version doesn't seem to have a large enough POI database and it doesn't allow searching for a specific house or building number.  advice: stick with the lite version until the searching improves in the pro version or bookmarks are implemented.

B0056AFBB2|5.0|Overall, this case is amazing and I recommend it to everyone who is looking for a large case with great airflow. I'm going to focus on some negative aspects that haven't been pointed out so far.<br /><br />The great part about this case is the amount of space that is available for use. Not only can you use the largest of heatsinks available, but you can also change to a complicated radiator setup with no modification. The fact that the top can support 240mm with room to spare for 140mm radiators on the back and bottom of makes this case very flexible in regards to cooling options.<br /><br />The one sad thing is the front intake. The front fan mounts are \\"snap in\\" plastic clips with peg mounts to keep down vibration and add stability. While this setup is convenient for installation purposes, it limits fans to box style housing. Although many quality fans fit (I'm enjoying 2 Yate-Loons) it does limit things as some of the highest rated 140mm fans use rounded frames that cannot be held in by the clips. This arrangement also precludes using radiators on the front without major modifications to the case.<br /><br />The fan filters provided are lightweight and do a good job of filtering the larger dust particles. I don't get dust bunnies, but I do get a thin coating of dust; however it is easy to remove with compressed air. The top and bottom filters are removeable. Unfortunately, if you remove the top filter, you expose the fan support grills underneath and the case definitely looks as if it is \\"missing something\\". (Yes that also means that the top fans must deal with both a filter and a grill!) The front fan filter also has a honeycomb grill and a filter, but the grill is the front protection that you see on the outside of the case.<br /><br />Fractal has designed a wonderful case that targets high-end users with a mid-range cost. The airflow through the case is outstanding due to the number of fan options and the quality cable management system. If you're looking for a new case, you can't go wrong with this one.a new case, you can't go wrong with this one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful app, easy to use and access. The reading plans are a nice help and it's easy to share with others.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|All it takes is one idea to be shared to change the views of an entire community. I love Ted talks and i love how every person that shares seems to have truly mastered thinking outside the box.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Using the Hyper 212+ and the HAF 912 case, I managed to easily bump my clock up to 3.8GHz and a reasonable voltage of 1.4875.  Prime95 has been running for 2 hours, and is still running in the background as I type this.  Temperatures rarely budge above 50C, but they barely peeked over it a few minutes ago, but it seems to hold steady now.  If you want an aggressive OC, go for 3.9 or 4.0GHz, but going above 1.5 volts is a big no-no for beginners.  1.5 should get you to 4GHz, and this fansink will keep it cool.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|First class writing and a great read. Howey has created a well-rounded dystopia that puts the dys in the topia and doesn't let up.  As the chief protagonist in a completely unrelated work of speculative fiction ([[ASIN:B008NCD766 God Bless The Dead]]), I know a little bit about alternative reality.  Let me just say that I wouldn't trade my world for this one even if there was a Hugo in it for me, you know?  I love the characters, I feel for them and cringe for them on almost every other page, which is to the author's credit.  I'm just saying, I couldn't go up or down that damn staircase even one more time.  I give the girl credit, she must have legs like a friggin' NFL running back.  I recommend you check out the whole omnibus, not just the partial bus; just have a scotch on the rocks really close at hand.  Maybe two.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game! plays great on my android tablet and galaxy phone. but what about the new kindle? it doesn't show as an available app to download on my new kindle :( please edit app and make it available there too. Thanks!!
B006YRVY2G|5.0|This CD is a great addition for Sherlock fans.  The soundtrack is the perfect compliment to the DVD.  I would highly recommend this product.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I am Buddhist. For centuries Buddhist philosophers like Nagarjuna wrote books to prove that a god-creator doesn't exist. But old treatises are old. The God Delusion is brilliant explanation based on facts and modern day science. Really deep and inspiring.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|When I saw a review giving this movie 0 out of 5 (the 3rd time this respected source has ever done so), I should have listened. If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people's childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).<br /><br />Go watch the '86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I'm not talking Pink Floyd).
B005LAIGLO|5.0|I'm very picky with action movies, I've seen so many, but this one will keep you on the edge of your seat! Ben Foster & Mark- great duo.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I got this HSF to replace a stock cooler on an i5/2400. At 50% speed, the fan is pretty quiet and it keeps the processor cool without having to spin up.<br /><br />It fits great in a Silverstone TJ08-E case.<br /><br />Definitely a buy.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Good read for anyone interested in health and running.  I like how he added some of his recipies to the book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|LOVED IT!  Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job of tying everything together throughout the book!  We can hope that the movie is as good as the 1st one.  They managed to keep the movie true to the book, which almost never happens!  I suggest to everyone to read this series, it is awesome!
B007KDFWRG|5.0|This is the Tedeschi Trucks Band (husband & wife), including a whole host of a total of 11 world class band members, performing modern day, live, improvisational (improvised) blues-rock,(including some \\"classic\\" cover songs), & \\"jam\\" rock, at its very, very best. This is the Tedeschi Trucks band follow up to their grammy award winning studio album \\"Revelator\\"<br /><br />On this live double album, the Tedeschi Trucks Band, takes live music, to where it has never gone before. They just let the music flow & follow the \\"vibe\\". They are totally in \\"sync\\", with one another, and the beautiful music, just flows.<br /><br />Susan Tedeschi's Blues Vocals are \\"Awesome\\", Derek Trucks electric guitar playing (including slide guitar play), is totally \\"Awesome\\". The rest of the band members are also, simply \\"awesome\\". This is some outstanding live music, period.<br /><br />My favorite song is \\"Midnight in Harlem\\" (Swamp Raga Intro with \\"Little Martha\\"). The song \\"Little Martha\\" was written by the late/great Duane Allman, and this \\"Intro\\" is definietly a tribute to him.<br /><br />This is definitely Album Oriented Music, where you just put in both the CD's into your CD player, and just let the Music \\"take you away\\".<br /><br />Thanks, and I hope this review has been helpful.

B003O86FMW|5.0|What can I say about this book but totally awesome!  I loved the description of the Quell arena and how each character plays their rolls withing the story.  Each page seemed to slip right by within seconds and it took me about 3-4 days to finish the book, only because the kids DEMANDED my attention!  ;)<br />I cannot wait to finish the 3rd book just to see how Katniss and all her allies turn out.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|loved this movie in the theaters and now that it is on dvd i love it even more cant even tell you how many times i have watched this movie everyone should get it an watch it over and over.
1400052181|5.0|Possibly the best book I have ever read! I love this book for it's scientific information about one of the most important cell lines in history and the emotional story of Henrietta's life. It has something for everyone. It also opened my mind to the world of medical ethics. I made my roommate (who does not care for science) read this book and she fell in love too. The only problem with it is that you won't want to put it down, so make sure you have a lot of free time the week you decided to start it!
B00514HDNW|2.0|I found it funny that some of these reviews called this suspenseful.  This must be the first book they've ever read because it is anything BUT suspenseful.  I gave it 2 stars only because of the concept, not the actually story line and how it was written.  You can sum this whole book up on a single page, double spaced, probably less...so I'll try.  Neville barricaded himself in his house after everyone turned into vampires ***SPOILER*** by bacteria ***END SPOILER***.  He worked on his house for a lot of the book, making it sound proof, etc., he ate through a lot of the book, and drank for even more of the book.  He fought with himself and his thoughts (obviously since he was alone).  He found a dog that wasn't affected by what was going on and had survived the vampires, so he lured it in for what seemed like an eternity ***SPOILER*** and then for it to die immediately after he brings this companion in to live with him ***END SPOILER***.<br /><br />The last chapter was the only one of any interest and I won't even include that in my summary because I hate people that ruin books by writing about how it ends (the rest of the spoilers I've written are just from the front half of the book).  It is interesting the thoughts and psychology behind the last chapter, and how the book came to be titled \\"I am legend\\".  It was the only good part, but when compared to other suspenseful books and thrillers, this ranked dead last for that.<br /><br />If you were a fan of the Will Smith movie \\"I Am Legend\\", if you liked all the concepts in that and were looking for a book that was similar to that theme, definitely PASS ON THIS BOOK.  There is only one \\"chase scene\\" where he gets a scare by being outside when it is getting dark and the vampires all come out (not even that late in the book either).  There is next to no suspense, even with that \\"chase scene\\".  All he did was ride around the block, accidentally forget his keys in the car, have to run and get them as the vamps were getting closer, then get them and get inside.  All this happened on what seemed like 2 pages on my kindle touch (so probably about a page long in the real book).<br /><br />I love scifi thrillers/suspense and this was anything but that.  Definitely one of the worst vampire books I've read so far...I'd say it ranks worse than Twilight in terms of story line about the vampires (minus the teen love story in Twilight).  I was bored with it and couldn't wait to finish it...luckily it was pretty short.  This coming from a guy that read vampire books when he was younger (around 20 years ago, way before the vamp fad we see now days).  This is anything but a vampire book IMO.  It talked about blood sucking 1 time...ONE TIME.  I can't even go on without spoiling it...the vampires were just stupid in this book...please, just find a different book to read.  Idk what these other reviewers are smoking, but I want some if it can take a bad book like this and turn into something interesting.g closer, then get them and get inside.

1596912863|4.0|Jane has a secret obsession with Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy that is affecting all her relationships.  No man can live up to those standards.  When her great aunt discovers her secret, she gives Jane a three week vacation in Pembrook Park, where everything is like regency England.  Jane hopes this will help her get over her obsession, but can you ever stop dreaming of Mr. Darcy?  This is my favorite Austen fan fiction.  It feeds your Austen obsession, but doesn't change any of the stories you love.
B008N9AASC|5.0|I made the right choice.  I went to see \\"Samsara\\" in 70mm at the theater and was shocked how breathtaking the film was.  The film begins with Balinese women performing a sacred ritual dance and ends with a group of other dancers duplicating a many-armed goddess of an Eastern religion.<br /><br />There is no narration...just one image bleeding into another - of both the sacredness of life and its opposite.  Although quite a few of these images are familiar to us....they are photographed in such a stunning way - with such depth of field - that they feel fresh again. Examples would be architectural long shots of Gothic Cathedral interiors with multi-colored, perfect stained glass windows, the Hall of Mirrors of Versailles lit by chandeliers, a gorgeous shot of Bryce Canyon National Park, a widescreen view of dozens of ancient Indonesian temples in a lush background of green, or time lapse photography of night Los Angeles with its sparkling lights and streaming cars. Yes...it is truly similar to \\"Baraka\\", done by the same cinematographer - but I actually prefer \\"Samsara\\". It moved me more profoundly.<br /><br />Yet, there are troubling - even terrifying images of what mankind is doing to our earth - the reckless creation of enormous rubbish piles of discarded electronics, the mechanized slaughter of mass numbers of chickens and cows in agribusiness, the frightening journey of miners who must hand carry sulfur out of a pit of hell, the senseless distribution of modern guns to the remotest regions of the planet. Alas, the pictures that disturbed me the most were ones in which hordes of people are wearing the same brightly colored uniform, doing the same task over and over again...from Chinese factory workers to Hispanic prisoners. Totalitarianism...or a brave new world.<br /><br />This is a film that will make you think, and perhaps most important, make you choose. What environment do you want to live in?
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I thought this movie had enough content to suit the whole family.  I like the story and how humorous it was throughout. I enjoyed this movie very much and would recommend to anyone who likes these type of animated movies.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my children love this game so I checked it out and I think its great.  I love the ice age movies and this game was entertaining
1401322786|5.0|The story begins with Dor, the first man in the world to think about and measure time. But as punishment for measuring God's greatest gift, he becomes Father Time. Forced to live in a cave where time is meaningless and eternally listen to the pleas of mankind asking for more minutes, days, years.<br />After thousands of years, Father Time is given a chance to redeem himself by seeking out two people on Earth and teaching them the true meaning of time. Thrown into the current world, Father Time learns that his innocent measures of time have evolved into desperate time tracking. Seeking two people whose pleas Father Time heard, he finds Victor, a wealthy business man whom wants to live forever, and Sarah, a girl who wants time to end. Dor must teach them the true meaning of time to save them, but in the process save himself.<br />Albom provides another beautiful novel that explores the concept of time that we all take for granted. Through his thought provoking prose and diverse characters, Albom, teaches us something more important than counting the minutes, hours, and days- he explores the true meaning of time, why God limits it, and what really matters in life.<br />baseballvalbooks.wordpress.com

B005QJZ5FA|1.0|Seriously, this has to be one of the most overrated albums! I feel that she has no connection to her songs and that she is just reciting the lyrics, and they have no meaning to her.  Where is the heart?<br />Sorry, I just found her singing to be very bland!  When she was on SNL I thought she was horrible, but people kept stating that she was off that night and assured me that her album was great...well, after listening to her album it sounds like she is always off!
0802473156|4.0|The book really helps put things in the perspective of your significant other.I was able to understand my love language as well to pin point my needs.
B008B0QH5S|3.0|I've been a PSB fan since I was a teenager in the early 90s, and have ever album, single, b-side, video, etc that they have released. They are one of only three artists in my music collection where I am an absolute completist, so I bought this album sight unseen, day one purchase, instabuy.<br /><br />Now that I'm having some time to sit down and give it a good listen, I have to admit I am disappointed. For me, the reason why Neil & Chris have managed to keep my attention all these years is that they make good, incredibly catchy electronic inspired pop music. Now when you think about that statement, you have to realize that that is incredibly difficult to do. There is a ton of \\"pop\\" music out there, and an enormous plethora of \\"electronic\\" music, but PSB have always managed to rise above the chaff and create meaningful lyrics, introspective phrases and passages, amidst a grand stage of uptempo beats mingled with even catchier down-tempo songs.<br /><br />My first bump in the road with the Pettos has to be with the album Release, put out around 10 years ago. Nary an electronic beat to be heard amidst what was more or less an acoustic album. I gave it many tries, I really did, and finally decided that this just was not their sound. Now, unfortunately, we have what I am terming the second Release album - Elysium. I know I know, bands have to \\"evolve\\", give it some time, you'll love it, it will grow on you.<br /><br />Well... perhaps. But upon first listening, I am once again as disappointed as I was those many years ago. Ballad after god awful ballad fills this disc, with a couple of catchier up tempo pieces to fill in the gaps between the absolute boredom of Inivisible, Hold On, Give It A Go (really, can we please GO, instead of sitting in the easy chair!?!?)<br /><br />I honestly do not believe Chris Lowe had much input on this album - his fiery beats and melodies are nowhere to be found here, and even Neil is trying too hard to bring life to such droll lyrics, thatI question how much control he really had over the writing as well. I know in the music biz it is common for artists to move from producer to producer on each album, so that their sound doesn't become too stale, but in this case, I think PSB have found someone who utterly ruined their sound.<br /><br />I will give this album a few more listens, and may shelve it for several months before another go, but I'm not too hopeful that time will cure what ails this one. Hopefully the B-sides on the first single are as good as I've read... maybe there is hope still for just one more barn stormer album? Come on Neil & Chris, I know you can \\"Give It A Go\\"!<br /><br />Update 09/15/12<br /><br />Second listen through, and I regret having used the word \\"god awful\\" above to refer to much of the slower pieces on the album. I think the more appropriate description is tranquil. Clearly the boys have set out on a more chill vibe this go-around, but the second time through I didn't find it nearly as offensive, as I knew what to expect.<br /><br />As for the comparisons to the reaction that Behaviour got when it was released - I listened to that album straight through immediately after Elysium, and I believe the comparisons are not fair. Behaviour to me is a much more detailed album, filled with nuances and messages that take many listenings to get. Many of the songs themselves are crafted much more intricately than most of the ones on Elysium. And for me, nobody, not even the boys, will ever be able to top Being Boring (my personal favorite song of all time).<br /><br />So - I'm upping my rating to 3 stars. Unlike a lot of people, I actually really like the track Winner, but that may be because I absolutely love watching the Summer Olympics every 4 years. Requiem in Denim and Leopardskin is also another song that stands out - not because I think it's particularly catchy, but because it vaguely reminds me of Your Funny Uncle. It's almost got a kind of lounge feel to it too, I dunno, it's an interesting track.<br /><br />Anyways... I've said enough.
B004CURZFC|5.0|The animation is exceptional and the story line quite creative. This makes for an intertaining movie with a good moral for the ending
B008ER9QKG|5.0|I like the grand Zefirelli traditional stagings of Verdi operas, but Wagner's Ring is a totally different kettle of fish, since it is located in mythical, not real time. That is where Robert Lepage steps into and delivers with a wallop.  Worth every penny, believe me. The bonus disc is indispensable. Watch it before anything else. I had no idea of the risks the best voices in the universe take while walking up or  sliding down a multitude of pirate's planks. This is a set of records I will watch repeated-ly.

B007H9B6KA|5.0|I love this album! This is by far the best work of Garbage since Version 2.0. - I just can't get enough and listen to it at least once or twice a week at work.<br /><br />Highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of any of the previous albums of Garbage. This one has a bit for every taste. I love Blood for Poppies and Automatic Systematic Habit...<br /><br />Don't know what has happened to them, but age (and 7 years of absence) has definitely suited them well. I recently assisted to one of their live gigs, and let me tell you Shirley has never sounded better! This album is a keeper. Buy with confidence, you won't regret it.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|The books are easy read.  A little too much sex too often.  Really who does that.  Stayed with it to see how the characters evolve, and why.
B005MMYEF8|2.0|My girlfriend and I started watching the first season, Blood and Sand, when it first aired and we were hooked. We diligently TIVO'd every episode so that we wouldn't fall behind and could not wait to see what happened next. I would say that the first season, Blood And Sand, is definitely worth watching.<br /><br />The second season, Gods of the Arena, became tedious after the first several episodes, I gradually got bored with the writing. The writers seemed to be grasping at re-wording the same, vulgarly witty catch-phrases. It became so obvious and cheap that I finally gave up.<br /><br />The writing was something like this: Instead of saying \\"I'll stab the beast in the heart!\\" They would say something like \\"The beast's heart shall find piercing from my blade.\\" Okay, fine, I love it when the language is more poetic and richly explored. However, EVERY line was like this. Instead of saying saying \\"I have to go to the toilet.\\" They would say \\"The toilet's seat must find my arse!\\" Etc... It became gimmicky rather than poetic. It was formulaic rather than clever.<br /><br />I ultimately found the dialog annoying and juvenile, the story boring and extremely slow-moving, the plot too simple, and the action predictable and lame. It became a festival of \\"shock the viewer\\" gimmicks with barely a spec of intrigue when compared to its predecessor.<br /><br />I give two stars instead of one because of the production quality and the inventiveness with which the producers/writers/directors handled the real-life tragedy of the original star's death. Also, most of the actors did a fine job, especially with such physical roles.

B004GCPJDQ|4.0|Thanks to Benz, I got this charger and was able to set it up properly, i.e. care with installing the batteries (which by the way there is no reason to remove once they are in) and making sure the charger is not on a metallic surface.<br />Connection's fine, weight is fine.<br />my one complaint (after using it for about a week) is that the Apple mouse indicator does NOT reflect the charge.<br />Unlike some other people, mine did not hit a max of 80%. Rather it stays at 100% until the battery dies! Then, when it's charging, it stays at 5%, the whole time it's charging, so I don't know when it's done.<br />Hope that helps.

0792163710|4.0|This was a classic western in its day (1953), with a plot that has since been reworked many times with variations. The eponymous star is Alan Ladd, a drifter who happens on a homestead occupied by Van Heflin, his wife Mary (Jean Arthur) and son Joey. Local cattle barons, the Ryker Brothers, are trying to evict Heflin and other homesteaders to have the whole range for themselves to raise beef cattle. Inevitably, the confrontation becomes violent. The Rykers hire themselves a gunslinger, Jack Palance, to get the job done but they hadn't reckoned on Shane joining in with the homesteaders. The photography set against the Rocky Mountains was breathtaking. The film, nearly two hours in length, was produced and directed by George Stevens and was based on a story by Jack Shaefer. The background music was composed by Victor Young.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Steven Spilberg's Schindler's List was an amazing movie in my opinion. Ever since grade school we have been educated on the Holocaust and the horrible slaughter of several Jewish individuals--men, women, and children. Some where killed lethally by gas in shower chambers, experimented on, shot, or tortured; then their bodies where burned and the ones still alive where made to pick up their bodies or shovel the ashes. That was something that  I thought was interesting, throughout the movie you think it's snowing. But you then find out, it's the ashes of burning flesh. That singular thought alone, made me sick on my stomach. Throughout the movie I shed tears because of the torment and disgusting torture they had to endure.  One of the best scenes, in my opinion, in the movie was when Schindler is standing in front of all the Jews he helped save, approximately 1100, and Stern hands him the ring they made from a Jewish man's teeth - with the engraving \\"save one, save the world.\\"  Oskar looks at him and says \\"I should have sold the car, or my ring, it would have saved several more.\\"  My eyes flooded with tears of passion and reaching out. Because a man, who sacrificed his own llife (if he had been caught) to save thousands still found room to criticize himself and found room for improvement.<br />I personally know an individual who's great uncle was on Schindler's list. And he is alive today because of Oskar Schindler. That's absolutely astonishing to me. When you watch a movie, such as this one, you look at your life and say \\"What can I do for others?\\"  or \\"How is my life so bad?\\" Wonderful movie, I would recommend to anyone -- even outside of educational purposes or personal attachment. :)
B00004RFFS|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in over 12 years and bought it to replace the VHS version I previously owned as well as watch it with my husband who had not previously seen it. Although I had viewed it several times in the past and remembered many lines by heart, it was just as good as I remembered it! I am happy to add it to our collection!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed all three books, but I think that was my favorite one.  So many more things are revealed and explained.  You get a better understanding of the Fifty Shades.

The fight sequences were great, of course Alice does some mega moves on her enemies but shes Alice. :) It keeps your attention from start to finish. I did not see in 3D none the less I was 110% satisfied. I pressume 3D effects would have made it 100x better.

B006QVRVJK|5.0|My Dinner With Andre meets Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf.  Wonderfully acted, darkly funny and blisteringly intelligent.  We totally enjoyed this film.<br />With the claustrophobic set and clean staging, it was easy to see this movie was adaptation of a stage play, which made it all the more fun.  Polanski didn't sacrifice the dialogue for the sake of the film.<br />Loved it.

Pick them all up, give them a read, and have a laugh-filled week.  Or weekend.
B003O86FMW|4.0|An exciting second installment to the series.  My only complaint was that too much time was spent on the Katniss/Gale/Peeta love triangle.  While I understand that choice of a mate is very important to teenagers & young adults, it's really hard to sympathize with a girl who has a choice of 2 georgeous hunks - both with many admirable qualities, both of whom she has deep affections for, and aboth of whom are crazy about her.  With rebellion in the air, personal threats from President/Dictator Snow, and a crackdown on District 12 - it just seems like a love-decision with no bad choices is not the worst of her problems.<br /><br />Nonetheless, despite the above flaw, I'd still highly recommend the book as an exciting continuation of this fascinating apocalyptic futuristic scenario created by Collins.<br /><br />Patty L.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the bright colorful graphics. Moves from simple to quite challenging puzzles. Very easy to play. I hope there is an update soon. AND yes it is addicting. I could not put it down until I had solved the last puzzle.

I really have loved the ability to download videos to watch on my TV (I stream from my Galaxy tab to my Roku vis Juice for Roku.. my TV doesn't have internet access otherwise.. and Roku doesn't stream any youtube content)<br />I suspect that either YouTube is intentionally blocking downloads.. or some other change is causing the problem, not the download apps.<br /><br />Update: I am even more convinced that there is something going on with YouTube blocking downloads. Why is there NO response from anyone from ANYONE????

0743243153|5.0|This book is by the late psychiatrist, M. Scott Peck. If you ask me, everyone should read it.<br /><br />The book was written in the late 1970's, and has sold millions of copies since then. I had seen it many times over the years, but for some reason, I never read it. Several years ago, I got a copy, but it sat on my bookshelf and collected dust. Finally, I picked it up and read it. It was not really what I had expected. And I am very happy I finally read it. Maybe I just waited until the time was right for me.<br /><br />All that said, I'm not sure I agreed with the author on every point. He at least suggested that about everyone needed analysis, as in the long process of meeting regularly with a professional for the \\"talking cure\\". In fairness, maybe this is better than the \\"pharmaceutical cure\\" that seems to be way it usually goes now.<br /><br />The book is divided into four main sections: Discipline, Love, Growth and Religion, and Grace. The Discipline section is very to the point, and the points are made well, though maybe not all that surprising in themselves. If you think you know what love is, then read the Love section and see if you look at it the same way the author does; chances are this will be a no, but well worth the effort in comparing probably. No matter what your take is on religion/spirituality, the last two sections will likely have something that will at least annoy you, but I say read it anyway, as you'll probably still learn something, if only despite yourself. Yes, it is that kind of book.<br /><br />I read many things in the book that really spoke to me as an individual and helped me to make sense of some things that I never could quite understand in my own life. Maybe it will for you too; chances are it will. Yes, it is that kind of book as well. But, it might take some effort and real honesty on your part.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that anyone reading this book, and who makes the effort to understand what the author is saying, will find at least something that will help them in some way. Probably many things. Yes, it is that kind of book.<br /><br />If you want to know, you'll have to read it yourself. Yes, it is that kind of book.at least something that will help them in some way. Probably many things. Yes, it is that kind of book.<br /><br />If you want to know, you'll have to read it yourself. Yes, it is that kind of book.

B008602KQI|2.0|As I am an older gentleman, this was more of a teen type of adventure in my opinion. I really like action movies the best , but this one was more science fiction than anything. If she would have shot the President, it would have been a better ending. I will definitely pass this along to my Grand daughter.
0439023521|5.0|This book was a great read. The way it was written made you feel like you were with Katniss every step of the way. This book is very graphic but also opens up your mind and allows you to share the same prospective as the people in District 12. If you're not captivated on Katniss' compelling life story you are caught up in the action, romance, or the suspense in the book. The way the book is written is as if you yourself are in the arena with Katniss and you can witness each gruesome death and each loving kiss that goes on during the games. At one moment you are speed reading to see who will survive the latest confrontation and then you are praying for Peeta to get better, because you know Katniss would be heart broken if he died. You share the same tears as the characters in this book and you can almost feel the sting from every wound they endure both physically and mentally during the games. And as soon as you finish this book you will be reading the next because you are so desperate to see what the life of Katniss Everdeen is like after the games, and it might not be at all what you expected.<br />  ~ Angeleki Zecopoulos

B001FB4VXU|5.0|It feels odd to call this a second season where most tv shows that continue on have not more of the same, but new stuff added into the mix. In this show's case, it picks up right after Leonard's and Penny's date and continue's on with threads of a story, but mainly goes for humor, both nerdy and down-to-earth (sometimes, somehow, pulling both off at once). And of course, everyone's trademark styles.<br />Leonard being sensitive and trying to show his masculinity in the world.<br />Sheldon without a single trace of social skills nor manners basic manners.<br />Raj still having to get drunk in order to talk to women.<br />Holowitz still trying to pull off moves with women (and constantly failing).<br />Penny stillhaving no clue about science, yet finally accepted into the guys' life.<br />Oh, yes, and a little bit of Leslie Winkle, passionate scientist with a major power over Sheldon's massive scientific ego.<br />With a mix-and-match of personalities like that, you know there will be laughter galore, and there comes plenty of it in every episode. But not only laughter, but tenderhearted moments to show extra humanity (like Sheldon nervously giving Penny a hug and Penny telling to herself that she wishes Leonard didn't go). Here's to hoping future season continue on getting the guys to still be the riots they are in and out of the force (wait, no, no pun intended there).
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great show! You will watch the full season in short time. Damien Lewis lives up to the hype as the main character. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
B003OOWLU6|1.0|I can not understand why the creators of this show have a need to make every character gay or bisexual as if this accurately reflects people in general or makes the characters somehow more highly evolved. Very disappointing that the creators have ruined what would otherwise be good sci-fi by trying to make a social statement about homosexuality.

0525423656|4.0|Ink and Page's Quick & Dirty Review<br /><br />Rating: 4<br /><br />The Low Down: The second book in the Matched series, Cassia is trying to maneuver herself so she can get closer to the Outer Provinces and try to find Ky. As the narrative switches back and forth between Cassia and Ky, we catch up with what has happened to both since the end of Matched. It's not good, especially for Ky. Along with many other teens that have been labeled \\"Aberrations,\\" Ky is being used as a target in the Society's war against The Enemy. Too many of these kids die swiftly and without a second glance from those in charge.<br /><br />As for Cassia, she is to be returned to the Central after her time at the work camp is over. On the last day, she finds a way to get on board the airship that she knows will take her to Ky. She finds out that Ky escaped a couple of days before with two other boys. Along with Indie, another girl from the work camp, Cassia presses on and dares to hope that she will find Ky. And the rebellion.<br /><br />Best Thang `Bout It: Sounding like a broken record, I know, but I am so pleased that this book was a good, solid story that can stand on its own. The second book in the series has to bear its own weight and not only be a continuation of the first book. It can't only serve as a bridge to the conclusion, full of facts and catch-up. I am happy to say that this book swept me along in its quietly powerful way.<br /><br />I'm Cranky Because: Oh love triangles...where would be be without them? I know it'll all work out in the end, but &lt;sigh.> Both Xander and Ky are each awesome in their own way. If either of them gets killed off, or they have some sort of Hunger Games-ish conclusion, I will have my own quiet rebellion. I do have confidence that Ms. Condie will work this all out to the complete satisfaction of all of her readers. Yes.

0307594165|4.0|Home is lean novel (a novella really) that tells the story of two siblings who return home to Lotus, Georgia, a place that holds few fond memories for them, and the redemption they find there.  I've read a number of novels by Morrison, who I consider to be one of the most talented authors to ever put pen to paper, and I think most people will applaud Home while at the same time be left feeling a little let down - as if there should be something more substantial to it.  The novel is satisfying in its own modest way, but it's not nearly as complex or ambitious as some of Morrison's greatest works.  It certainly isn't as haunting as Beloved was.<br /><br />The story: Frank Money is back from the Korean War and is wandering aimlessly, with no plans to return to his home town until he receives word that his sister is dying.  Frank is dealing with the horrors of war and has a guilty secret he is keeping not only from the reader but himself.  Frank rescues his sister from a doctor whose experiments have nearly killed her and the siblings return home to Lotus, Georgia.<br /><br />The prose in this novel is leaner, and arguably not as poetic, as other novels by the author but it is still beautifully poignant at times.  I enjoyed this novel.  Despite its brevity it feels complete even if it isn't as powerful as Beloved or as lyrical as Song of Solomon.

0425263908|5.0|I loved this book! I loved all of the characters. I can't help but hope that Ava and Gideon are able to make their relationship work. They obviously have many more issues to confront in the upcoming books. But they are so perfect for each other. Only someone who has been there can begin to understand the issues they have within themselves as a result of their pasts. And obviously Gideon needs a lot of help. I was glad that he decided to get professional help as well. He does need to stop manipulating things though. (the photographer, the bedroom remake, etc.,) Ms. Day does a superb job of writing the powerful emotional pull that they have on each other, and I loved that.

B0019O6IWU|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a teacher of Buddhist meditation. I have much difficulty in expressing myself when confronted with hostile situations. The work place has been particularly difficult as I work for lunatics. (I hope they never read this!).  I was so tired of feeling like a victim and had experimented with many different ways of dealing with confrontation, both in and out of the work place. I think Marshall Rosenberg is a genius!  What a world we would live in if all people worked at this style of communication. I remain unskilled but have moments where I am able to respond to a difficult situation with a degree of competence, not realising I have been competent until after the event. I am a beginner in skillful communication and I can honestly say I am a joyful beginner as I continue to grow and learn with this style of communication. Life with colleagues, family, people in general, has become so much simpler as I learn more about communicating with other people. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to develop their communication skills in a positive way.

B003D87PGS|4.0|Enough has been said on this in the many reviews. Suffice to say here that I enjoyed this and I think you will too. The story is sad yet fascinating. The unique perspective given by the &#34;view&#34; of the murdered girl allows the author to explore the effects of the murder on the family and friends. We know who did it - it is not a detective novel. It is a unique book in my opinion. It is not 5 stars as I was not fully convinced on some scenes and the ending sort of fizzled out. I am not a believer in the afterlife so do not let that aspect put you off. The device of using this as a unique perspective works well.

B006H5120E|5.0|To this day, Titanic continues to amaze me even though I must have seen this movie more times than any other film in my life! The strange thing is I'm not a big Leonardo DeCaprio fan but the film had everything else going for it, from the romance/action/adventure angle to the fantastical movie score (including the Celine Dion hit) and the other wise wondrous cast, especially Kate Winslet, that I can't think of anyone else who could play this part BUT him!  When Titanic was given the 3D treatment' I couldn't wait to catch it on the big screen again.  For some reason, the first 3D viewing was a little disappointing  because it looked a little flat but when I saw it for the second time (did I mention I've watched this film several times...) everything worked for me. I noticed the subtle changes that director, James Cameron, made but it wasn't distracting.  3D has not been \\"all that\\" for me but Mr. Cameron seems to know what he is doing as he had previously proven with his mega-hit,'Avitar'.  He doesn't go for the gimmicky effects going instead for the \\"natural\\" look when it comes to 3D.  Since 'Titanic' wasn't originally made for 3D, the transference comes across more lifelike and not 'in your face'. It's release on DVD at this time however gave me a little concern because I just returned from New York to pay tribute to the victims and survivors of 9/11 and the stories heard is very similar to the images seen in 'Titanic'.  As far as the DVD is concern, the only disappointment I have is that the movie is (like the original release of 'Titanic' on DVD) broken apart on two DVD's.  I haven't gone thru the 4th disc yet since it has something like 30 deleted scenes and 60 behind-the-scenes but it also includes his TV documentary 'The Final Word...' which showed the intense passion and vast knowledge James Cameron has for this historical event that has proven to be unsinkable. And even though 'Titanic' has been released on DVD in several versions...this is the one to get; unless you stumble upon the four disc 3D collector's edition that is already being sold by \\"collectors\\" for almost $300.00.

B0083TU56E|4.0|I bought the \\"mini\\" version of this for my 2yo son as part of the set. I didn't find it particularly interesting but he ADORES it. In fact he liked it so much I went to find him the full size board version, which was harder to do than I expected. The drawings are lovely as with all Eric Carle books, and the story is cute.<br />One thing I was hoping the board version would have is stiffer paper for the fold-out pages. It's really quite thin/lightweight and so prone to tearing when young kids play with it a lot.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Ok, I watched this show from beginning to end on Showtime, I awaited the show after an interview with Guin Turner speaking about an idea for a lesbian show in the works and after the show was over I bought the dvds and watched them again.<br />  Its a show about a group of friends in West Hollywood.  Most of them are gay but some are bisexual and straight.  You have your 2 domestic lesbians Bette and Tina, you have your player Shane, busybody Alice, gay athlete Dana, temptress who likes to woo with words (amongst other things), Jenny, who's a self centered head case who thinks her coming to the realization that she's gay is the most important thing on earth, Tim (straight guy trying to make a life with his girlfriend) and Kit, the troubled alcoholic.  Later on a number of other characters come into it Lisa (male who thinks he's a lesbian), Max (transgendered), Carmen (hot dj with a heart of gold), Papi (female embodiment on Don Juan), Sasha -or was it tasha-(soldier trying to avoid a dishonorable discharge because of being gay, Jodi (deaf artist who doesn't care for monogamy), Tom (gay interpreter for Jodi), Helena (millionaires) and Paige (sweet, openminded single mom).  Oh, there are more.  The first set of course being the beginning characters.<br />  One thing to know about these women- during at least one occasion in most of their lives they get exactly who they want and then as soon as they get them they decide they want someone else.  It gets aggravating.  These women just love to kick themselves in the butt.  Most of them seem to have everything in the world going for them but to keep the show going they ruin everything they work for.<br />  Some of the women are rich, some aren't rich and some are downright struggling for money but they all wear designer clothes.  There are a lot of things about this show that are so far from real life that its ridiculous BUT I love this show.  It keeps me entertained from beginning to end.  These peoples lives get so crazythat it never gets dull.  You basically over a series of 6 years watch most of their lives fall apart.  Its showtime so of course its really sexed up. It has  tons of gay and gay loved groups come through the show like Goddess and She, Betty, Peaches, Sleater Kinney and more.  The music on the shows basically consisted of similar groups though there is also some hip hop.  Snoop Dog was on it for a while as a recurring guest star.<br />  The show can be a big predictable but this is my 3rd time going through the series and I still love it.  Season 1-4 were my favorites. After that the characters become more and more unlikeable.  By the time season 5 starts to unfold Its like looking at the pile of unfortunates that have gotten jilted and trampled going through the web of the group of central characters insanity.  By the time Paige left the show I really didn't care so much what happened to Shane, I didn't care what happened with Jenny earlier on than that, Bette and Tina didn't have anyone to blame but themselves for their problems but they didn't seem to see it that way and Max like Bette and Tina blamed others for his own mistakes BUT I love the show.  If you don't watch it all six seasons and stop at 4 you never discover what the show is ultimately leading to.<br />  I give the show 5 stars because after watching it in 3 rounds Id be a liar if I didn't.
B005Y5L2WG|5.0|Just when you thought twilight saga was over.. Vampire Diaries brings the same passion, with a little more action pack and twisted story lines. What a great show!!
B0010SKUYM|1.0|[edited 1/1/13, & again on 1/6/14]<br />I decided to go back and edit this review a second time because a reviewer pointed out that I didnt talk much about the book, just basically critiqued readers who enjoyed it. I already edited once, however, because after reading what I wrote the first time, it struck me as overly mean. I am not a mean person, I dont \\"flame\\" people and don't want to insult anybody. Writing a book is not easy, let alone three, and in addition to the countless hours it takes, it requires really putting yourself out there and being vulnerable. So I apologize for being harsh previously and have to clarify my statements. That being said...<br /><br />I was really excited about this book and really wanted to love it. That is, no doubt, part of why I felt so betrayed. I have never written a negative review of anything in my life, but the hype of this book is so inexplicably HUGE that I feel compelled to say something. Reading The Name of the Wind was not just a waste of time, it made me feel bitter and angry that such popularity and acclaim could be ascribed to something that seemed to me to be so poorly executed.<br /><br />I could not get past page 200, in fact, and struggle to comprehend how people can think this book is well-written or the characters at all believable. It is trite and contrived. So much of the story is cliché, contradictory, or just plain silly that I found myself rolling my eyes or grunting to myself and shaking my head in disbelief at just about every page.<br /><br />I apologize if you enjoyed it. I admit that sometimes I find a story so interesting that I can overlook some of this stuff myself, but for whatever reason, I just couldn't take it in The Name of the Wind. I had to cry Uncle and do what I so very rarely do: give up on a book.J.K. Rowling and George R. R. Martin to name just a few.<br /><br />There are just too much great literature and fantasy books out there to waste time on stuff like this. And this is coming from a person who still reads a fair number of \\"candy\\" sort of fantasy and thriller type books. I just wish people would be a little more discenring and appreciate the troves of amazing books that are available, thousands of which are free in the public domain! But in the end all that really matters is that you enjoy what you read, and if you aren't picky, you may love this one.

B0085A9J18|5.0|Through friends, numerous reviews, and a couple of movie trailers I decided to check this flick out once it became available.<br /><br />Hands down one of the best action flicks I've seen in quite a while.  The plot is simple, but not a problem.  The non stop action will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The fight scenes are outstanding.  Amazing how all the action takes place in the confines of a run down apartment complex.<br /><br />The DVD has English dubs if you prefer not to watch the subtitles.<br /><br />This is one film I proudly added to the collection without a second thought.  Check it out and enjoy!

B004XISI4A|4.0|I couldn't wait to read George R R Martins, \\" A dance with Dragons\\" to continue the saga of the \\"Game of thrones\\" fantasy, all my favourite characters are back! and once I started I was caught in that wonderful quandary whereby I didn't want to stop reading and yet didn't want the book to end, but end it did and what's more it lends itself to many more books ( I think 3?), putting it in the same vein as the Wheel of time series (another epic classic).<br />A dance with dragons continues the saga in fine form, following some interesting plot lines and adding a few more to boot! and I found it a wonderful read, my only complaint would be the headache caused by the complexity and amount of characters we are inundated with, like the previous books which possibly delved into the sea battle in too much detail? I felt the connection and intimacy formed with the beloved characters diluted by the constant addition of many more names!<br />But aside from that I am so looking forward to the continuation of this wonderful and engrossing series, George RR Martin is a fantastic author and the connection I have formed with the characters is an intimate and very personal one, I cant even name a favourite! Jon, Bran, Arya, Tyrion! Daenerys and so many more, please, please get writing and lift me out of this depressed state caused by withdrawal symptoms as I am denied access to my beloved Game Of Thrones.
B000HNV4GE|5.0|When this came out in theaters, I must have seen it half a dozen times... and that was when it was only playing in hidden away places, for special foreign films.  It was indelible to me at the time.  A recent re-viewing has really knocked me over, that I had forgotten so much, and re-enjoyed it all over again.<br /><br />I don't know what these reveiwers are talking about with two discs and the like.<br />Unfortunately I had this version (the dark blue purple case, with Grant on the front), on the shelf for quite a few years still in shrink wrap.  When opened, it was only one disc, and I was very unhappy with the fuzzy film quality of the disc as a whole; but the story is still unforgettable, and remains perhaps the best of all films ever made on homosexual love. (None of the bodies are great; but the emotions are true and real.)<br /><br />Maybe for some of you this seems a little dated.  But I am older, and still grieve for that youthful \\"love lost\\" because it was never found. Sorry, I don't value gay life and the gay world; and always wanted someone straight-acting and straight-appearing... not the circus I've seen that \\"gay\\" is.  Have experienced it all, and want no part of it.  Nothing honorable in it.  But strangely so many films do it that way, with straight-type characters; don't know why life seems that difficult to find and be made real as depicted therein.  But it seems it is. So you either accept less, and that's what you get... or go it alone.  No choice, really.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain was also exceptional, except for that first sex scene, which I never could agree with in the film; because that is not the prime focus of the way two guys make love.  In prison, maybe, and in porno films, but not in ordinary love relationships.  (Or with those I knew.)  But this is not a forum on techniques or preferences.  Just praise for a film well-made and sensitively rendered.<br /><br />And Maurice is definitely a classic for the genre.

B001KNUUTM|5.0|This collection is by far one of the best recordings of the WTC available today.  I have listened to many recordings including those of Glenn Gould, Angela Hewitt, Andras Schiff, and Till Felner, and have to say this is my favorite.  Till Felner's recording of the first book comes in at a close second and might even have tied for first if he had recorded both books of the WTC instead of just book one.<br />  At times, Feltsman employs a deatched touch that results in a quasi-Gouldian tone.  However, unlike Gould, Feltsman varies his articulation (I love Gould's spikey, rhythm-driven approach, but it is not always appropriate). Schiff and Hewitt are too \\"proper\\" for my taste.  While they are creative in their phrasing, they are not as creative in their articulation. Schiff has a beautiful legato, but EVERY prelude and Fugue is legato. Felner suffers from the same over-romantic touch. If you are looking for an interpretation as varied in style and ingenuity as the pieces themselves, this is the set for you!  It can be tiresome to listen to so much polyphonic music in one sitting, but Feltsman's diverse approach gives each prelude and fugue a distinctive character eliminating the fatigue experienced whilst listening to other performances.  I second the other reviewer's remarks about sound quality, Feltsman's recording engineers did a superb job.
B008B11R1Q|3.0|Upon first listen of both singles, I was apprehensive about where the rest of the record would go. For starts, similar to Beyonce's cloying wedding aisle appropriate \\"1+1\\", \\"Angels\\" gushes with irritating abandon. Sex and intimacy were more courageously and intriguingly addressed on their eponymous debut. \\"Love\\" -for example- is a loaded word and its lyrical laziness takes away from the album and makes it feeble in comparison.<br /><br />Tracks 3 through 6 save this album purely because they play to the band's strengths. Dialogue between bass and guitar and Oliver and Romy's vocals are just as good as their first record, but on these tracks only really. Rhythmically these songs are dynamic and flow nicely into each. It starts to really feel like an album here.<br /><br />Later on, though, Croft's guitar playing really just starts to suck. Sure, that nice, fender twin, reverb'd out sound is idyllic, but its power and devastating subtlety are lost if your parts aren't good. Per usual, Jaime's production is spot on. His drum sounds are perfect.<br /><br />This band consists of, for lack of a better word, kids. The lukewarm success of this record thus far will be a great thing for them purely because they'll come into a new season of their careers and make a record that will be even more divisive.<br /><br />Things will have to get darker in order for old fans to keep paying attention.

B000O77SOK|1.0|Not only should ALL of these season be available, they should be out on Blu Ray too! This is a disgrace. The best legal show Ive ever seen. I admit Ive never seen Boston Legal or most recent shows though. I used to look forward to this show so much going through law school. It was the only legal drama I could believe in. The cast was excellent. Every law firm of reasonable size has multiple Bobbies working for it and at least one Jimmy.
B00873GRU4|4.0|This was very much a book of two halves for me. The first half seemed terribly slow with way too much description of people climbing and descending stairs. Fortunately I persevered as the second half was exciting, imaginative, tension filled and very enjoyable. Overall I definitely recommend it to sci fi fans and fiction fans in general.
B005QUQP76|5.0|I opened this mouse package and Holy Sh** ! It's built like a tank ! 1 piece aluminum body , adjustable weights on the bottom , it feels great to use and is as responsive if not moreso than all of the other high end gaming mice on the market .

Anyone , gamer or not will enjoy the feel and responsiveness of this mouse . Corsair hit one out of the park with this one .<br /><br />Oh yeah , the \\"SNIPER\\" button on the thumb side of this mouse is a really cool feature lol . I am lovin this mouse .

B005LAIHZE|1.0|I think some of these DVD/Blu-Ray manufacturers are pricing their product out of the market.  Why is this disk $30.  It's only 1 disk, there's no DVD in the package, there's not even a digital copy.  Nothing extra yet they're asking a premium price for the product.  The pricing on DVDs & Blue-Ray disks is getting totally ridiculous.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I've read all Lee Childs Jack Reacher books and this one was the worst, the plot was slow and predictable, action was non existent, the ending was a real letdown, actually it sucked. Save your money, your not missing anything if you're a Reacher fan.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|I recently was lucky enough to come across a copy of Kiss Destroyer on vinyl, but was suprised at how muddy it sounded.  Most \\"guitar\\" albums sound better on vinyl, but this was just a mess, just like The Cults \\"Love\\" vinyl LP.  I chalked it up to Ezrin trying to create a unified peice of music that shared a reverb-y muddy atmosphere. I even checked out my CD copy to make sure, it was pre-remaster, but it shared the same crappy sound.<br />So I was very happy to find out about a month later that Destroyer was being remixed from the original masters (or digital copies of them).  The result is much, much better. Much cleaner. It sounds more like a \\"guitar\\" album.  Yes, this could have had more new features, but it least they can't jack up the price now.  BTW, I got my copy at Best Buy and the cd itself is black, not silver.
B0081X40HW|5.0|I was already a fan of Haley's voice and hoped that she would hit a home run with this album, and it's safe to say she hit this one out of the park. I listen to this at least once a day since I got it and I enjoy it more each time I hear it. The only criticism I have is on the track called Oh My!, and that is because of the sub-par injection of rap. That song, and Haley would have been just fine without the added, and poorly versed words. Even with that though, the album is well worth the price. I already can't wait for the next one.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|These books have WAY too much hype for the quality of writing.  The first one was a fun read, but anything past that was not worth reading.  If you read the first one you have already read the other two, she just keeps repeating the same things over and over.  Maybe she should take the money she's made off these books and take several writing classes!

0606259090|5.0|I think it takes a lot for someone to write and complete not only one book, but three and get published.  People always want to be critics, well let's see you all write the next bestseller or worst seller for that matter.  I loved the book and no it wasn't perfect, but it was good.  Seriously, people get over yourselves.  I have been trying to write and complete a novel for a long time - it isn't easy.  I am glad the author wrote this book and finished.  It was a fun and interesting read and while it isn't the most \\"erotic\\" book I've ever read, it's still a good story.  Good job.
B00846REIS|4.0|This story was pretty well written, the sex was hot, the main characters were hot, yet still flawed. I'm looking forward to reading the next book so I can find out exactly what happened to the main characters in their past and see if they can make a go of it. Yes, it's a story line very similar to 50 shades, but I enjoyed those also. Bottom line, if you liked 50 Shades you'll like this.

We learned connections between civilizations and objects that we had not had knowledge of previously.  Many of us intend to keep this book as a reference book.  The author was knowledgeable and also drew on authorities to provide information in their areas of expertise.  An intriguing book enjoyed by all of our group.

Everyone contributing works their tails off in respect to the legend in their presence and the legend himself is in super form. As time continues to tick by and original true blues legends are thin on the ground this great recording stands out as an essential blues recording caught just in time before losing this wonderful bluesman. Do your very best to not miss out on securing a copy of this sensational recording. Blues Blues Blues !
1594744769|4.0|My spouse and I read the book. I know it is directed at an adolescent market, but the topics discussed within it's covers have meaning for all. I really liked the mysticism of the \\"special kids\\", but the underlying story is of how these special kids would not be alive if their parents did not send them away during Hitlers attempt at world domination. It is a fascinating story, i loved it, and I am sure others will too.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|J. J. Abrams's reboot of the Star Trek franchise is great entertainment. It's a by-the-book blockbuster that ticks all the usual boxes but doesn't deliver anything unexpected or leave much of a lasting impression. But that's fine because that's what blockbusters are all about. It's a shame, however, that the storyline is a tad formulaic. The cast are uniformly good, and manage to portray the familiar characters convincingly. Overall it's a good, solid couple of hours of fun. 3.5/5.

B005H9B44A|2.0|Thor has such great potential, but this movie strains so hard to be so amazing it gives itself a stroke.  The acting is ok, but the story is so simple MST3K will have a go at this one day.  EFX cannot replace a well rounded story.  The story has structure, but tries too hard to make itself great.  I am tired of the look of modern movies being determined by average crap concept artist who use photoshop and one trick lighting techniques.  Look to the real world for inspiration, it is far more amazing than all the garbage, backlit, brown and teal concept art you are basing your work on.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|I have followed some techniques described in this book and would like to thank the writer for his help. It's good writing covering everything from the front matter to converting you text. There weren't many things that I didn't know of (I grabbed the book, because it was free and because I needed some Kindle formatting guide in one piece), but I enjoyed following the tips that were clearly outlined in a super simple manner.<br /><br />What I missed though was the formatting tips for documents with pictures inside. The book told to make a separate html filtered document with pictures zipped in a separate folder. Well, I did that, but it didn't work. I had to republish it. The solution was simple - just upload the whole MS Word DOC file with pictures inside (not wrapped) and that's it. Maybe someone should update certain parts of the book. Anyway, a comprehensive read.

B000YIGNKE|3.0|I was expecting much better, the older version of Persuasion is something I have owned for a long time and I wanted this one to see the story, which I love, performed again and perhaps differently.  I was especially put off with the running around the city of Bath in the final scene.<br />But, all in all, it tells the story that Jane wrote and that is why I purchased it.<br />I love all things Jane and this is something I shall keep and view again, but after watching the older version and this one back to back, I have to say that one is best.  <3
098555780X|4.0|I have been a fan of J.D. Lenzen from his TIAT instructional videos for quite some time. His latest book is easy to follow and understand. He is big on teaching a point of view that encourages expansion on the concepts in this book to creat new and amazing ties of your own. It will be a joy to use for both the beginnier and the acomplished craft/knot enthusiast. My only caution once you get hooked on this hobby it is tough to stop.

The work of sorting through the stress of these issues is exasperating and difficult.

It is exceptional historical fiction and I cant wait to read the sequel coming out this month. It is about England, France and Germany around the early 1900's and the beginning of the World Wars. I'm not a war fan by any means but the author sucks you into the story as if you were there. Awesome reading.....

B004J6YO12|4.0|This 1970s/early 1980s British band, originating in Birmingham, England, was decidedly different from most in that era in that their concerts and records in their early years employed a string section in an overall gathering of eight members. While always having much more commercial success in their home country, with a couple of albums reaching # 1 on their charts, in North America none of their material ever reached those heights. Still, from late 1972 to 1986 they did put 27 singles onto the Billboard Pop Hot 100/Bubble Under charts along with 10 crossovers to the Adult Contemporary (AC) listings.<br /><br />This album, which was released in 1979 on Jet FZ 35769, an independent U.K. label launched by Don Arden and distributed in North America through CBS, was their first U.K. # 1, and in the U.S. it reached # 5 on Billboard's Top 200.  It also produced four U.S. hit singles, the first being Shine A Little Love, a # 8 Hot 100/# 40 AC in May/June 1979 on Jet 5057 b/w Jungle. Later that summer Don't Bring Me Down became their best U.S. Hot 100 single when it reached # 4 in late August/early September on Jet 5060 b/w Dreaming Of 4000. In late October/early November, Confusion topped out at # 37 Hot 100/# 41 AC on Jet 5064 b/w Poker, and they closed that year out with the # 39 Hot 100 Last Train To London on Jet 5067 b/w Down Home Town. None of the B-sides were part of the album.<br /><br />Those four sides also became hit singles in the U.K. along with another track, The Diary Of Horace Wimp, with most of them reflecting the burgeoning Disco sound. Which was probably the main reason why the lineup did not include their string section of violinist Mik Kaminski and cellists Hugh McDowell and Melvyn Gale, who had been part of their first 15 U.S. hits. However, in the music videos created to promote the album in the U.K., that trio did participate. The main band consisted of Jeff Lynne on vocals, guitar, piano and synthesizer, bass guitarist Kelly Groucutt (also vocals), pianist Richard Tandy (also synthesizer, clavinet and electric piano), and drummer/percussionist Bev Bevan. The backing orchestra was conducted by Louis Clark.<br /><br />A bit of trivia associated with the album sleeve is the photo on the back cover depicting a fierce-looking Middle-East palace guard drawing his scimitar. That, in one of his earliest professional jobs, is none other than Brad Garrett, perhaps now best-remembered as the 6' 8.5\\" tall cop brother Robert of Ray Romano's character in the hit sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond!<br /><br />The tracks (all written by Jeff Lynne), are:<br />Side One<br />1. Shine A Little Love - 4:42 (the U.S. single version was trimmed to 4:09)<br />2. Confusion - 3:42<br />3. Need Her Love - 5:09<br />4. The Diary Of Horace Wimp - 4:17<br />Side Two<br />1.

B0088X7YMS|1.0|I bought a copy of Starship Troopers Invasion from Amazon to complete my collection.  Several days later I attempted to watch the movie.  When I buy a DVD I expect to be able to put it in my player or my computer and watch.  (It works that way for my other 500+ movies).  Instead I get a small screen come-on from Sony to buy ST I and other movies from Sony through the cloud.  There was not a way going through the ad to reach the movie nor a way to avoid the promo.<br /><br />I am not fond of the infomercials at the start of DVDs for wasting my time and I really do not like this from Sony to avoid showing me the movie I purchased.  Without being able to see the movie this is a fraudulent ripoff.<br /><br />The trailer for the movie shown on the Sony blurb did show CGI looking figures trying to stop a Bug Ship invasion on a ship, but the trailer by itself is not worth the Amazon fee nor the full price for a Blurb to buy Cloud products.  Maybe there is a way around so that the movie can be watched. but after 3 attempts I stopped.
B008OOYALE|1.0|The game has cute graphics and seems playable, but it takes forever to do anything.  Want to grope some food for your dragons?  Wait an hour. Want to evolve your dragon to the next stage? Wait 3 hours.  The game becomes one where playing it means just checking it once a day to collect some coins and grope more food.  You can things hurry things along a bit with gold bars-but the ONLY easy to get gold is to pay real money.  And everything is extremely expensive! The economics of this game make it dull to play.

0525953728|5.0|I ordered this book before it was released.  Nay-sayers of the book and the author are the idiots who haven't/or won't take the time to read it.  The author starts the book off by making it very clear that no military secrets are to be uncovered.  And he goes to great lengths to discuss the measures taken to ensure that this remains true.  Once that issue is settled the book becomes a great read.  The end result is off course the elimination of a cancer on society, the death of Bin Laden.  An excellent book of heroes by a hero.
0007477325|4.0|\\"One percent of people will always be honest and never steal. Another one percent will always be dishonest and always try to pick your lock and steal your television. And the rest will be honest as long as the conditions are right.\\" ~An anonymous locksmith<br /><br />When I was a using addict, I lied so much that it became second nature. I told big lies, small lies, dirty lies, barefaced lies, white lies, and black ones too. My motto was, \\"Deny everything.\\" Even when the deconstruction of my fabrication was readily apparent and the evidence of my malfeasance displayed before me...I lied.<br /><br />  I didn't realize that this particular shortcoming, one among many, was yet another manifestation of my ugly addiction. I just assumed that I was a liar, always was, and always will be, one more shameful label branded upon my less than reputable character. So I was relieved to discover that that's not who I truly am. You see, addiction cannot survive without dishonesty. Honesty is to addiction what water is to fire, what light is to darkness. The two cannot co-exist. And that would explain why the topic at my first recovery meeting was...you guessed it - honesty.<br /><br />  So that's why I would waste my oh-so-precious time reading a book titled \\"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty\\". It's written by Dan Ariely who is a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University. He conducted many experiments to discover what motivates a person to cheat as well as what keeps them honest. He also discovered a couple of things that, counter-intuitively, have no effect on honesty.<br /><br />  So what increases dishonesty? Conflicts of interest, watching others behave dishonestly, the ability to rationalize our dishonesty, and, surprisingly, creativity, all seem to increase dishonesty. What decreases it? Taking pledges before the temptation, moral reminders such as honor codes or the ten commandments, also presented right before the temptation, and supervision (obviously), decreased cheating. And what had no effect?<br /><br />  Contrary to what you might expect, Ariely found that the amount of money to be gained and the probability of getting caught had no effect on whether a person would lie cheat or steal. And he found that most people, at least the people who participated in his experiments, will cheat a tiny bit, up to the level that allows them to retain their self-image as a reasonably honest individual.<br /><br />  While this book didn't exactly deal with the level of dishonesty that accompanies addiction, I still found it very interesting, chock-full of humorous anecdotes and Ariely's witty observations. I learned a little more about human nature, which is a fascinating subject to me, and you can bet that I'll be more aware of the forces at play the next time I'm tempted to lie, cheat, or steal.<br /><br />Review Written by David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"iously), decreased cheating.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I didn't know quite what to expect of this, but in the end found it very moving. Jaycee Dugard chooses to tell her story in her own voice - she did not use a ghostwriter. While this means that the writing is simplistic at times (remember she only received formal education through 5th grade), it is straight from the heart. Some sections read like a journal (and in fact she includes some passages from a journal she kept while in captivity), others read more like a therapy session, and some are very basic descriptions of her day-to-day life in captivity. Because it is her telling her own story, it is focused on what she remembers. In 'Reflections' sections she sometimes shares information that she learned later, but this book doesn't try to relay the 'whole' story, in terms of filling in what her mother and authorities were doing to find her, or any of that. It has a very insular feeling, which it seems to me mirrors exactly the isolated life that she was forced to live for so long.<br /><br />The early chapters are difficult to read, because she does recount the horrible rapes and abuse she was subjected too. Once her daughters are born, the story shifts to their bizarre day to day life. Animals were a huge part of what kept her going, and so she shares many animal stories (including the ways that these were frequently taken from her, another method of manipulation.) Once she is discovered and reunited with her family, she shares just a few stories from her unique therapy, which included horses since animals were such a big way she and her daughters related to the world. 18 years is a lot to cover, and she can only remember so much, so there are gaps. Certainly I found myself wanting more information in places, so that I could try and understand this horrific crime. But it can't really be understood, and the purpose of this book isn't to try and do so. It is Jaycee telling her own story, and I respect her so much for doing so.<br /><br />I think complaints about the writing, the graphicness, the 'boring' details re: her life and animals are all unfair. She is sharing her experience to the best of her abilities, and in that sense, this is one of the most authentic-feeling memoirs I have ever read. While I found myself wanting more, and almost went online to research her situation more, I decided not to, because I don't want to feed the hunger for information about her. She and her daughters deserve to live the rest of their lives in privacy and safety, away from the public eye. I wish that for them, and I hope the proceeds from this book will help them to do so.riting, the graphicness, the 'boring' details re: her life and animals are all unfair.

The book could have spelled that out in a quarter of the pages.  The other three-quarters of the book was inconsequential fluff!!  A contrived load of horse manure!  The characters were morbidly overused cliches! A complete waste of time.  What would Dor think about me wasting the last 4 hours of my life on this book?  The only time I didn't waste on this book was returning it to Amazon for a refund.....Great service Amazon, by the way...being able to return ebooks..loved that:)
B006O7XOOW|3.0|This Ballcano is an OK toy. The balls may be the best part of the toy, and given that children at this age are so easily appeased--this large contraption made out of plastic may be totally unnecessary. It takes up a lot of space and for people like us without a lot of space, sometimes we just don't know where to put it. It is fun for the baby to use it to support herself and try to stand. It is sturdy enough for that endeavor. The thrill of the ballcano seems to be short lived. I probably would not recommend it to anyone unless they have a dedicated playroom. The music is fine but our baby prefers real music. I think I'd rather just have the ball set then this whole contraption that will end up in a land fill. When the balls are lost...I doubt I will go through all the trouble of ordering, what is told by the other reviewers, these hard to find plastic balls.

B00006F1LX|5.0|Personally I've always been a huge fan of the movie \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and almost all the things made by Quentin Tarantino during the 90s. We can always criticize him for his habit of picking ideas here and there when creating movies, personally I only judge on the finished thing. I always found the movie \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" a bit too long, and it could have been  better with actor James Woods playing Mr. Orange as it was originally intended. We can credit Quentin Tarantino for making me like things I usually don't; for \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" it was horror movie, in the case of \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\" it's 70s music who is wisely used. In this excellent two-discs collector's edition there's all the music from the movie with some of the movie dialog who help to put us in the good spirit, two songs from the movie \\"Jackie Brown\\" and a 16-minutes interview with Tarantino on disc 2. They call it an interview but in fact it's only him talking freely about his views on filmmaking and especially how he pick the music. It's really interesting, we learn among other things that when he have a movie idea the first thing he does is rummage through his own personal records to find a \\"spirit\\" for his movie. For \\"Pulp Fiction\\" it was the song \\"Misirlou\\" that we hear during the opening credits; he found that the song was  \\"arrogant\\" and would thus provide a very good tone for the movie. Personally I believe that \\"putting the energy at the right places\\" is very important to make a good film, I tought that the movies of George Lucas for example were sometimes lacking an original \\"spirit\\", even if he's obviously very good when creating and imagining a good story. Overall I highly recommend this 2002 2-CD deluxe compilation to everybody especially those who loved \\"Pulp Fiction\\", all the songs are excellent.
B000FC2L1Y|3.0|I have enjoyed the characters in the Outlander series but have now begun to feel manipulated by slow moving plot lines and long descriptions of landscapes.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Having a personal contact with men who fought in these battles made this movie come close to the heart. Movie gets as close as possible to the real meaning of war and the effects on man. The pure hell these men endured.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|i was initially skeptical. but after many uses am finding it a great key to falling asleep faster for naps or at night. Most definitely worthwhile.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved this book! I loved the characters and I loved the way it was written. Because everything is written in letters you feel like you really get to know the characters better, almost like you are there with them. I thought the characters were fun and I enjoyed their spunk. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. Its just one of those feel good books.
0345529057|5.0|First off it's a great series. Also the books are mass paper back, so they're smaller and the text is small. The books were completely unharmed, brand new, and have some great art work on the covers. Arrived on the exact date specified. Overall I am very pleased and so far like the books a lot more then the TV show. 5/5 Great deal for $23!
B00866JL96|5.0|So happy. The dvd was here before I knew it and perfect in every way. Satisfied completely!! I would recommend using this company when ever you can.
B0041I0N9A|5.0|If your a fan of Star Wars and like LEGO then this is the set to buy.<br /><br />OK lot of special parts but the scale of this is massive.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought that the book was slow starting but really got good as i got into it.  However, the end left me hanging.  I went back and reread the ending to see if I had missed something.  I don't think so.
0143119680|3.0|I love the concept of a witch falling for a vampire.  The book starts out beautifully.  However, half way through, you realize the author is repeating herself yet again and explains to much as if the reader is stupid.  Also, if Matthew is so powerful, why can't he fight a single vampire (Juliette) by himself and win.  There were too many inconsistencies and too many plot lines that didn't gel.
0345803485|5.0|Well written and a good plot. Now reading the 3rd book in the trilogy can't wait to see how it ends, but it is one of those books that you would like it to go on forever. Has a lot of cliff hangers and the book is not as centered on s&m as the media built it up to be. It shows the scars of child abuse and the long lasting effects of it. I love the books and it will be hard to find a book that can top this .
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It was great that I could purchase all of the HP movies for a very low cost. Don't let all the morons who gave this one star deter you away from buying this set if all you really care about is the movies. If you want special features, spend more money. Simple math and common sense can do wonders, 12 dollars per movie on blu-ray would probably make you think that there won't be special features. So don't listen to the pre-pubescent twelve year olds. If you are looking for just the movies, I would recommend this product.
B006VP1OYO|4.0|The remastering on this set is fantastic, and much needed. most mbv fans have only heard these songs from mp3s from the original, out-of-print cds. The songs themselves are standard mbv, so if you already like mbv, you'll love these songs. the average listener will start with loveless, move to isn't anything, then get this ep collection. but it is worth every penny. the first five tracks alone are worth it. they make up the 'you made me realise' ep, which is regarded as one of the greatest [if not the greatest] ep's of all time.<br /><br />it also has some rare tracks: \\"instrumental 1 and 2\\" were on a limited vinyl, \\"sugar\\" had been around as a promo during the 'isn't anything' era, and the \\"glider (kevin sheilds remix)\\" was only on vinyl. also the last three tracks are \\"unreleased\\" but they've been around for a couple years now on an unofficial bootleg called 'lost tracks and rare cuts.'<br /><br />\\"angel\\" [aka \\"the time of day\\" / \\"belinda's song\\"]<br />\\"how do you do it\\" [aka \\"cowboy song\\"]<br />\\"good for you\\" is the same title.<br />one leaked track: \\"just like us\\" [aka kevin's song\\"] is not included.<br />i do want to say that the mixes of these songs are better than the 'lost tracks' vinyl rip.<br /><br />also not included is the andrew weatherall mix of \\"soon,\\" which was on that same vinyl as \\"glider (kevin sheilds remix). \\"map reference 41°N 93°W\\" from the \\"whore: various artists play wire' comp, \\"we have all the time in the world\\" from the 'peace together comp, and most significantly: the 'ecstasy' and 'strawberry wine' ep's. both were compiled into 'ecstasy and wine' but were the first releases with belinda butcher. they were pre-creation releases, so that's why, but i was really wanting to see those ep tracks remastered.<br /><br />so, almost complete. fret not though, the remasters are superb, and the unavailable tracks are floating around and aren't hard to find.
0439813786|4.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret<br />Brian Selznick<br />Scholastic, 2007, 534, $7.95<br />Fantasy<br />9780439813785<br />Audience: Grades 4-7<br /><br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret follows the life of a young orphan, Hugo Cabret, through the streets of Paris, the walls of a train station, and the history of film. His coming-of-age journey of self-discovery introduces him to new friends, old stories, and mysterious toys. This young adult novel not only captivates youthful minds through mystery and fantasy, but it also intrigues the older reader by exploring the exciting history of film. The book is written as if the reader is watching a movie.<br /> After losing his father in a tragic accident, Hugo Cabret relocates his life to a lively train station where he works as the clock-keeper. Brian Selznick fluidly and cleverly intertwines the storylines of both Georges Melies and Hugo through the fantastical worlds of film and magic. I particularly enjoy the careful historical explorations of the story involving the birth of film in the early 1900's. As a person who appreciates film and the derivatives of the craft, I am able to identify the historic nostalgia that the novel upholds for the film industry.<br /><br />Reviewed by Gabrielle Shepard<br />Agnes Scott College<br />Decatur, GA
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What an imagination!  How does someone come up with a story like this.  I could not put it down and read the next two books all in less than a week.
B005LAII6M|1.0|Milla Jovovich returns to the franchise. This is the worst one thus far. Theme is the same: zombies, infection, and virus. The story-line is Terrible! There were High-Expectations for this film, but a huge let-down. Many folks discussed it after the movie ended, and most were upset that that this one was Missing a lot. I give it 1 Star for Action & Fighting, because that's all it was, without a story. A huge disappointment from fans of the heralded series. Some viewers told me that they were so bored, they fell asleep. This one is simply not worth the money for your movie ticket!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|An excellent book and quick read.  Very satisfying and could not put it down!  I will make my husband read it before the movie comes out.  It probably won't be a good as the book.
B005K2XM94|5.0|Got this case for my Mom for Christmas in 2011. She's still using it and it's held up great. She has a stylus that she sticks in the fold of the case, it stays put and that is the only accessory she needs. I recommend this case to anyone with a Kindle Fire.
B008IYR2BA|1.0|Well thank goodness for Breaking bad or TV would have totally gone down the drain with  Dexter season 6.  NO imagination anymore.
B006UUL5TY|4.0|This DVD of Ian Hunter and the late Mick Ronson in a 1980 concert performance in Germany was originally recorded for a German TV network show.<br /><br />It's a good representation of the Hunter-Ronson Band's stage show at that time and is well worth having if you're an Ian Hunter or Mick Ronson fan.<br /><br />The camera work and video editing are good. The sound is also good although, to my ear, Mick Ronson's guitar is a bit too prominent in the mix and tends to drown out some of the other instruments in places. On the downside, this concert was recorded on video tape and the original tapes seem to have degraded a bit over time, so while the picture quality is quite acceptable it's not up to modern standards.<br /><br />Amazon's page for this item doesn't include a set list so I'll include the set list here:<br /><br />1. FBI<br />2. Once Bitten Twice Shy<br />3. Angeline<br />4. Laugh At Me<br />5. Irene Wilde<br />6. I Wish I Were Your Mother<br />7. Just Another Night<br />8. We Gotta Get Out Of Here<br />9. Bastard<br />10. All The Way From Memphis<br />11. Cleveland Rocks<br />12. All The Young Dudes<br />13. Slaughter On 10th Avenue<br /><br />Overall, a worthwhile DVD for Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson fans.<br /><br />Addition to original review: I see there's a CD version of this concert as well. If you're interested in a concert CD of Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson from this period, I'd advise getting Welcome To the Club instead of the CD version this one. This DVD is worthwhile but remember that the length of the show was restricted to fit into the TV time requirements, so this concert is shorter than the Welcome To The Club concert on CD.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I've been watching these guys ever since the sing-off; they're tighter than ever in their harmonies and PTX Volume 1 only wets my appetite for more! I've always loved their rendition of Starships, and Somebody That I Used to Know is, quite frankly, better than the original (it just *works* better as A Capella; more moody). Definitely worth the money!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I've been a fan of both Mark Knopfler and Emmy Lou Harris since the late 1970s so I bought this CD as soon as it was released.<br /><br />Given the respective talents of Knopfler and Harris I expected great things from this collaboration and I wasn't disappointed. This is a really good CD.<br /><br />I you like the music of Mark Knopfler and/or Emmy Lou Harris, you'll like this CD.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app was working perfectly fine untill about 2 days a go.  now everything has A bad quality connection and I am unable to watch any videos at all.  its really making me mad.  another thing this app constantly does is force close at the most random moments; which then causes you to have to get off the app and restart the whole program.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|A different rendering of the old tale - but found it keeping me on the edge of my seat through the whole story! Wife commented from the other room, from just hearing it - `Wow, is that one wicked queen or what?' Have no quams about recommending this film to others.<br />5 Star!<br />It appears alot of the reviewers are reviewing the Actors and Actresses. This is the last thing I review. I watch the movie - if I like it - that's all that counts no matter who's in it! The viewing time went fast. (If it's a boring movie - I have a tendency to stay until the end - which takes forever! But not with this movie!) Did not find it boring, and yes I think that someone else in the role of Snow White might have made the movie a tad better but overall it was a good evenings entertainment!<br />(Aside - if Snow White was a raving Beauty - do you think you'd believe that a raving Beauty will hold up that well in the Black Forest, versus the actress that actually got the part?)
B00005N6KG|1.0|I bought this headphone 2 months ago, and it already stopped playing any sound on the right side. Very disappointed. I run with it every other day for only an hour, so only a total of 30 hours of playing and it is already kaput. Cheap material and poor construction quality.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|There is absolutely no way a true videophile could ever think that this is simply an upconvert of the DVD. It baffles me that others have suggested it is, and it's disappointing as well. If consumers take the misinformation to heart, then this title will do poorly and there will be little hope of seeing more catalogue films like this making it to Blu-ray.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite films, so I have watched the DVD plenty of times and the difference was extremely noticeable to me. Colors stand out on this transfer like they've never stood out before and fine detail is present in most scenes. A good example is when the Terenzi brothers fall into the ball pit. The detail, color, and depth in that scene is sublime. There are moments of softness present during some interior scenes, but everything else is great and I noticed no artifacts. Black levels were solid. Considering the source, a low-budget cult film from the '80s, this transfer is stellar and made me giddy when I saw it.<br /><br />As for the audio, it's not the best I've heard (nor should anyone expect it to be), but didn't disappoint. Sometimes a hint of static can be heard during dialogue scenes, but that's a fault of the source and not the mix.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the extras are all ported over from the DVD which means there's still a fine collection of material, but no Dickies music video.
B0021L8V1Q|1.0|Received Iron Man 2 before expected date but found the bluray quality is pathetic, it stuck at the start I cant watch 2 starting chapter and then the 2nd last chapter stuck I have to skip those chapters. I did not write to you about this because this is the second time happened with me last time you people sent wrong bluray of Journey to the center of the earth and when I complained you refunded its amount and then I placed new order with Iron Man 2 this is the reason I did not complained due to your irresponsible attitude next time I must be careful before ordering any product.
030758836X|4.0|I loved this book - until I got to the end. After I pondered it for a while, I decided that it was the least predictable ending. Just because I wasn't wild about the ending, it didn't ruin the experience. It's a great read.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|There is no control of the purchase of acorns - my son who is 5 purchased over $150 before I caught it!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Compared w/ the free version which isn't different at all this is kinda pointless but its still a fun entertaining game
B0017VG66I|5.0|Two of the best ever westerns. Love them both. Had to buy this set to add to my DVD collection. Both of these films are great old westerns. Wayne and Stewart are terrific in \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" as is Lee Marvin. \\"Shane\\" is just simply a classic film. Great performances from the entire cast. Even though Jack Palance was afraid of his horse he still shines in this film. A great movie!
B0090EIILU|1.0|I have viewed previous Sasha Cohen Baron movies and was always able to find some humor in them dispite the shameless vulgarity. But the DICTATOR went too far with its senseless insults of ethnic groups. The scene with him playing a video game of the killing of Israel's athletes at the Olympics was appalling. The movie was crude, insensitive, racial and far from entertaining. I'm sorry I rented it.
B000005RMY|5.0|Great cd was in perfect condition! I'm very happy with it thank you! I've been looking for this album, and glad I finally found it has the best songs on it!:o)

1609611543|5.0|OMG! OMG! OMG!  The BEST book I have read in the last 10 years or perhaps my entire life!  I am a vegetarian endurance (tri)athlete and have an underactive thyroid coupled with chronic anemia.  To think that I could better my thyroid condition and live without iron pills is incredible!  And you know how we athletes are told from all sides that grains are a must for our hard working muscles!  In the height of my training (20-25 hours per week) bagels and pasta were the bread and butter of my existence!  And to think that I thought I am leading a healthy life and have an impeccable diet!  I am not going into the history of my plumbing, suffice to say today was the first run in YEARS without the runs!  I can't say enough good stuff about this book; it is educative and Dr. Davis has a great sense of humour and the book is an easy read.  For me it was not too technical at all instead very interesting.  And did I mention how delicious and easy to make his recipies are?  Flourless pizza with salad for dinner and the leftover for breakfast?  YUMMY!!  It is only the first week of my COMPLETE wheat free life and I don't miss even my favourite cheese scone at all!  I am looking forward to my whole wheat free future, not having to \\"watch\\" my weight, to ride, run and swim when I feel like it and not because of what I ate and to try out all those delicious (new) recipies out there!  Anyone whith any health issues whatsoever - it's worth a try!  Dr. Davis - please write a wheat free book specifically for athletes!
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I picked up this book the day it came out, in part because due to the Pentagon being up in arms about it.  I served for 11 years and I wanted to see if I could find the \\"classified\\" material that they were so angry about.  The short answer is that in my view there was nothing in this book that isn't available open source.  The TTP and the training that the author talks about are so broad based and big picture that there is nothing in this book that say, Dick Couch has already covered in more detail in his books (which are way better by the way).  The author spent the first roughly 60% of the book talking about his training and some of the missions that he was in some way connected to before he finally gets down to the raid.  After reading the rest of the book the part about the raid was, quite frankly a let down.  \\"Details\\" were not that detailed and he provides the 10K foot view of the raid.  Honestly I got more info by watching the news coverage of the raid.<br /><br />Overall, it is fairly well written but it is uninspiring and self serving and there are far better books out there on DEVGRP and this book is not worth the hardback price.  If you want to read it get it from Kindle or wait for the paperback version to come out.  On another note I have had to sign nondisclosure statements in my career and while I don't think he really divulged anything classified I think that after reading the book he showed poor judgement by writing it.  He really didn't add anything to the public's knowledge of the raid and in the end betrayed the trust of his unit and more importantly his team mates.  It seems that all the author did with this book is try to gin up some notoriety, credibility and name recognition so he can start up his future security consulting / shooting school / private bodyguard or whatever business.  SEAL's are known as the quite professionals and he should have stuck to that motto.
B007VDPE32|5.0|I was recently introduced to Rufus Wainwright (where have I been, not under a rock, so why haven't I known him?) on CBS morning show.  I love his melodies, his sexy,lazylike voice and dreamy way.  I ordered this album because I just couldn't get enough of him from my Pandora radio station.  I've listened to Out of the Game at least 10 times since I bought it and bought tickets for an upcoming concert.  I can't wait to hear him in person.  His music heals whatever is ailing me, always makes me happy, even when it's a sad song.....
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|This was a really good read - good twist at the end.  Easy to get caught up in the characters.
B008RV5K5E|1.0|First, let me preface this by stating that I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan. I loved The Dark Knight, Inception, and pretty much everything he has done...until now. I thought this film was entirely too long and stretched out. Even Christian Bale seemed like he was bored to tears for most of the movie. Instead of having him be out for vengeance after Rachel's death Nolan decides to have him retire? Um, no. That's not how Batman would react. You're thinking of Edward Cullen, Mr. Nolan. Anyway after that it's nothing but teleporting Bruce Wayne, heavy handed plot points, and a villain who sounds like he's doing a Sean Connery impression through a wrapping paper tube. You want to know what else was ridiculous? The freaking bomb that is supposed to blow up Gotham. First, it's some green energy crap but it has a timer on it for some reason. Second, why did Bane wait six FREAKING months to have it blow up? Yea, sure, he said it was to torture Bruce Wayne. Whatever, if you accept that logic then thats your problem. If Nolan had cut all of that out though this would have been a much stronger film. No magical back healing. No magic teleporting back to Gotham. No long drawn out scenes where he tries to climb some stupid wall (i get that it was supposed to be some turning point for bruce wayne but it took up like 30 minutes in a movie that was already way too long). I could keep going but im going to stop here and say it is tragic that Nolan followed up the modern day masterpiece that is the Dark Knight with this crap. I expect more from you Chris.
0345803485|1.0|Unfortunately, and against my better judgement, I was coerced into reading these books by a dear friend.  She means the world to me.  It took me a week to read them and frankly, that's a week I will never get back.  Sheesh, my title for these books is Fifty Shades of Stupid!!  Do not waste your time.  These books are written atrociously!  There is no story, the characters are ridiculous and I am praying that young women are not reading them thinking this behavior toward women is romantic!  Puhleeze!  I can not believe this book is a bestseller.  Kudos to the author for pulling the wool over everyone's eyes!  What a waste of time!  Laters, baby!!
B0061C1NQ6|5.0|Gorky Park leads the reader through an engaging encounter with characters that fascinate and a culture that is surprising, exotic and drawn with admirable craftsmanship.  Martin Cruz Smith clearly respects the Russian people and consistently treats the culture with love and irony.  It is always a pleasure to regard the worlds Martin Cruz Smith creates and the intelligence and core decency of his unique hero Arkady Renko.<br />Smith is a worthy peer of the most literate and imaginative authors in the detective/investigator genre.  You'll not go wrong spending time with Smith and Renko.
0670069035|5.0|If you start at the beginning of the trilogy, to me personnally, it was over all good movie, I like the charaters, I liked the girl because she is so different than your average actress, just to me well worth watching
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have to admin I'm not a fast reader. Even if I love a book I still take several weeks to finish it.<br />In the Blood Song's case I relied completely on the excellent rating by so many Amazon readers and bought a book from an author completely unknown to me.<br />Anthony Ryan became one of my favourite authors almost instantly, the book is filled with the exact type of fantasy I enjoy the most (not a J.R.R.Tolkien copy, no world conflict being solved by one superhero, no invincible allmighty wizards denying all physical and biological laws...), his well-depicted characters conjuring all sorts of emotional connections with the reader (me), the plot running in a nice pace... I find it hard to lay it down every evening when going to sleep (which I'm now getting later than usual because of the book).<br />Blood Song is definitely a story worth reading and one of the books I wish would never finish.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed The Language of Flowers very much.  Not only did I learn a world of information about flowers, I appreciated the excellent depiction of the main character. She was a young woman in a great deal of pain who managed to grow through her appreciation of flowers and through creating with flowers.  I was sad that she couldn't be \\"magically healed'  of the pain of starting life as an unwanted child.  But flowers and creating helped liberate her creativity and some of her love.  The author did an excellent job of describing emotions, emotional pain and angst, personal growth and development and ultimate lack of developing as fully as possible. It was an unexpectedly powerful book for me.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|What can i say about kill decision? i really loved this book!!! i have read the last two books from Mr Suarez and being a fan of those i very much liked kill decision. While you do not have to have read either daemon or freedom to read this one i think its good to read other works by an author. This book definitely kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole thing and the ending is good too. The only thing i would change about this book is that its too short it needs to be longer. Also Mr Suarez has already stated that his next book will not be a sequel to this one I think this is a mistake. The way this book ends it needs to have a sequel to finish the plot.
1400069289|3.0|As most reviews say, both entertaining and instructive, but some caveats are in order. Mr. Duhigg writes a nice journalistic style (yes, that is a compliment), but has a tendency to elaborate only one side of some the stories he tells to illustrate contemporary ideas about habit, thus oversimplifying for effect.<br /><br />What do I mean?  A couple of specific examples: Paul O'Neill gets superlatives for transforming the \\"keystone habit\\" of safety at Alcoa, including firing an otherwise excellent Brazil manager who corrected but failed to promptly report a safety issue; however,O'Neill's subsequent inability to transfer his method to his tenure as Treasury Secretary is shrugged off in a footnote as political differences with Bush Administration.  Well, maybe so, but could it be that Mr. O'Neil misidentified and/or misapplied the appropriate keystone habit needed for a different job?  Or possibly that he didn't appreciate that one of the necessary habits for being effective as a cabinet officer may be to criticize internally, but then get on board with the boss's keystone policy (the mistake that got the Brazil manager fired)?  Again, in Duhigg's chapter about the opportunity presented by a crisis to change old routines, Duhigg argues that crises disrupt the status quo (not a surprise), but then goes further to commend use of a crisis (by manipulation, if necessary) to further one's agenda to promulgate unrelated policies or, arguably, implement old routines of failed government. I suppose his quoting of Rahm Emmanuel that \\"a crisis should never be wasted\\" shows the dangers of trying to be contemporary when making larger points!  Unfortunately, crises may be used to implement bad changes as well as good, and you can get Hitler as easily as Roosevelt, a drunkard as easily as a reformed alcoholic: So maybe a less unconditional endorsement of using (especially manipulating) crises as means to generate new routines (in government, business or personal lives) should comewith more caveats.<br /><br />Despite its lapses into self-help book (or presumably intention, given the how-to-change-habits Appendix), Mr. Duhigg has written an informative report on the current science and understanding of habit. I don't hesitate in joining others in recommending it as an easy-to-read (again, this is a compliment) and up-to-date discussion of what we know about the power of habit. If the book was only a bit more careful in its advocacy of habit manipulation, four stars would be deserved instead of three.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|After losing 2 phones in six months to water damage (I have small, dangerous children), I knew I needed a waterproof case.  The Lifeproof seemed like the answer to my prayers.  I did the water test and installed the case oh-so-carefully.  Then my problems began.<br />1.  The cover sticks to the screen of the phone.  Badly.  It's like trying to look at your apps through an oil slick.<br />2.  Trying to keep track of the little screw the covers the headphone port is impossible.<br />3.  The phone won't fit on any speaker dock with the Lifeproof case on it.<br />4.  The door that covers the charging port snapped off after less than 6 months of use - rendering the case completely useless.<br />Of course I'm outside the magical \\"90 day warranty\\" window, so I guess I'm out $80.  Hopefully someone else will heed my words and NOT BUY THIS CASE.

B007VYDFMS|5.0|This is about the man who made the music,the road he traveled, the decisions he made and finally the music itself.<br />The music industry today is in shambles, but for anyone that thinks they are fighting a tough road, this documentary will give you hope. It also stands in sharp contrast with the kind of excesses and narcissistic actions of today's vapid pop stars, many of whom could not find a cause they care anything about other than what color to paint their nails.  Marley will live on as will other great artists, while the buffoons of today get forgotten, though arguably not soon enough for my taste.<br />Great film!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I couldn't bring myself to like this book. The author's repetitive use of certain words and phrases were very distracting and exasperating. Even the emails the characters wrote to each other were over done. I found them boring and quite frustrating. Gosh couldn't they just pick up the phone and talk to each other, instead. Once I hit the 70% mark I was totally bored. There were several moments where I just didn't want to continue reading the book. However, I hate not completing a read. I've only done it once and I was determined to finish this book even though I hated it. All I can say for myself is that this was not a fast read nor was it a page turner.<br /><br />I didn't like Ana at all. She is a smart young women who's self doubt and self confidence is that of a teenage girl. How can a man like Christian find that attractive? I was stumped. Her jealousy against Christian's past sub's (whom she never met) were totally crazy. Only adds to show how insecure she is. She's so afraid he will leave her that she is willing to do anything, even if she doesn't feel comfortable with it, just to keep him. Christian has issues. He is a control freak and Ana even acknowledges it quite often in the book. Some of the sex scenes were hot and some laughable. I know, I know...it's fiction. Still there are tons of fiction books out there that write way better BDMS scenes then this one.<br /><br />I could go on and on why I didn't like this book. However, I will just agree with the majority of people who have given it a 1 - 2 star rating. Most were right on the dime with their reviews. I'm not about to spend another $9.99 for the next book. I'm stopping here and I'm not going to read the rest of the trilogy.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Great watch for the money. I get compliments on it all the time.  The face is not to big in comparison to other invicta watch's.
B007XHWROK|5.0|I freaking love this album I like listen to it everyday<br />I have memorized all songs and sing it everywhere I go. My fave song is him and Drake. Right here
0525953728|5.0|The book is a true story of the rigors of being a navy seal, and specifically the raid that took out Ubl.  It was a page turner, and I read with awe about the training and deployment of these true patriots.  I felt inspired by their sacrifices.  A great read!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This was one of my favorite games on my phone.  I am glad it finally made it to the kindle fire.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is an amazing game. In app purchases are never a necessity to advance in this game. I haven't stopped playing it for days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As another reader who's been sucked into the Hunger Games trilogy, this one doesn't disappoint! In fact, it might (just might) even be better than the first. I took this on a recent trip, and have read almost all of it in just a few short hours. It's completely addicting!! (And this is a good thing.) I would highly recommend this to anyone who has read the first, or who is on the fence about reading any of them. I guarantee you'll get sucked in just like me!
B008WU02HG|4.0|I've listened to Mana for many years, however the last 3 or 4 records were somewhat weak compared to their earlier albums. This is a good compilation for those of us that didn't keep up with the band but liked some of their singles.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really liked the book but I felt unsatisfied with the ending. I guess I expected a little more, but It was still a great story.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This is one of my family favorite movie I reccomended to all of you if you are going to watch a movie with a family :)
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good read, but kind of slow going during the first 100 pages or so.  Almost didn't stick it out, but it ended up getting better.  Would have liked to have seen a better ending.  I guess you could say they deserved each other.
B004VMVTNU|1.0|when i uninstalled this app and tried to reinstall, it would not download again. i lost my money. still using the free version because I love the app.
1455502758|5.0|Simply great. Hitch's writings in this short book help you to not only realize your own mortality, but to accept it.<br /><br />While this book can be a bit on the sad side (okay, maybe more than a bit), Hitch's unmatched wit and quaint humor sprinkled throughout are enough to keep it from being completely depressing. Overall, it's a very short read; it can easily be completed within a couple of hours. However, I'll definitely find myself rereading this over and over again, as it's an amazing insight into the final months of a great man's life. It can be thought of as a final chapter to [[ASIN:044654034X Hitch-22: A Memoir]].<br /><br />The world lost a great thinker when Christopher Hitchens died. May his legacy live on for many generations to come.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Excellent story which is well written and very detailed as well as mysterious and haunting. I loved the characters and their complex lives.
B0024F08RO|4.0|I love this series but the ending was really bad. Seemed like the writers were just tired and didn't try too hard.
1451648537|5.0|I got the hard back version of the book for under $17, and you can't complain about that. I dug into it as soon as UPS left it by the door, but it's a fairly large book and I don't have a lot of free time to read large books, So...<br /><br />I bought the audio book and finished it by listening to it inbetween service calls during the day on my iPod. I felt the author did a fairly well-balanced \\"Good-Bad-and-the-Ugly\\" regarding Mr. Jobs life, and that's one hardcover that is staying on the bookshelf for a future re-read.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved the trilogy.  Couldn't wait to read the next book.  The most beautiful love story I have ever read.  Sure it had a lot of sex in it, but it was important in order to fully understand the true story.  I'm an avid reader and this is by far the best series I have ever read.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|this is one of the best puzzle games I've ever encountered.  months of playing and this is still a pleasant challenge.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|I have looked forward to the release of this book since I finished Mark's first novel, Zero Day. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The plot, characters and technical info kept me spellbound until the final page and is a fitting 'sequel' to Zero Day which rates as one of my favorite books of all time.<br /><br />For those who have read Zero Day the transition of the plot is seamless and you are absorbed into Jeff and Daryl's experiences within the first few paragraphs... like catching up with old friends you have not seen for a while.<br /><br />I recommend you read this and if you have not, definitely read Zero Day as well. The only frustrating part of this experience is waiting for the release of Mark's next book. Until then I will just have to read Zero Day and Trojan Horse again.<br /><br />Chris
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This watch is great for training, it works well in all weather and in heavy tree cover.  It acquires satellite signal quickly.
B006LSZECO|1.0|To me, this book was not entertaining at all. The characters were all people that I would do my best to avoid in real-life situations - not sympathetic or engaging at all.... The husband and the wife are both so self-absorbed and clueless that reading about them was painful. I finally gave up after 100 pages when I found that I really really did not care why the \\"girl\\" was \\"gone.\\" Very disappointed as Flynn's books are usually interesting and readable. Unfortunately, this novel was not....
B008XG1X18|3.0|pretty good interface but it sure  crashes or hangs a lot. literally everywhere third time I have to rstart orforce close at startup. weak.
0345501292|5.0|During a long time -before internet- I was able to collect just some photos and text about Indiana Jones, mostly from newspapers  magazines. Here in Argentina, it is almost impossible to find something else about our hero, besides the movies, of course.<br /><br />This book is like a dream come true to me. It has an incredible amount of good photos -mostly unknown to me-, and very interesting interviews.<br /><br />And the better thing is the price: really affordable! Also, I would like to mention the really quick delivery.<br /><br />So, I give you FIVE STARS! Thanks!
0525953728|5.0|Great Book,<br /><br />No matter what many haters say (those that rated to book with 1star), it is a great book that provides the author prospective and views of his military experience<br />and most of all of what happened during that incredible mission.<br /><br />No doubt that it is better to read it from the person that was on site and not to have to hear the many versions produced by the media.<br /><br />I am glad that I purchased and read the book and I recommended it to my daughter
