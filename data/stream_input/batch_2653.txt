B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun to play with my 5year old grandson.'<br />We enjoyed the challenges it really made us think.  We'd like more rooms to escape from.<br /><br />I
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Puzzles are fun and i like that you explore the whole room but need more levels to play, other than that good game!!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I could hardly put it down. The characters became very real and were portrayed as I would have thought in the particular situation. Interesting perspective from all these different and varied characters who actually came alive as I became more involved in the story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun and challenging for any age. And it also helps that the price is just right for anyone.
0307341550|4.0|I must say that after reading this author's other two books, I knew I was in for one heck of a ride, but this being the author's first book, I have to say bravo to Ms. Flynn. I was drawn into this dark tale from the first page. The way the characters manipulate one another is simply chilling. If anything this book is a must read based on the author's brutal depictions of how women play one another.
B001EOOQF6|2.0|if you have a copy of this album burn it<br />i only like one song on this album. country girl
B0063IH60K|4.0|Never had any trouble with that one. Consistant and as fun as a solitare game could be. I use it often during flights.<br />D
B003O86FMW|5.0|Breathtaking. A must read. It is amazing. Make sure to read the first book as well as the last one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|While being very descriptive it is also a very well written novel. A love story with unlimited and various up and downs..more than enough to keep the reader interested and wanting for more about  his beautiful power couple.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|What's not to like...great picture, sound and a solid script!  Just watch me now.....2.5 hours of your life well spent!
B009O07NDY|5.0|Howard Shore did it again! Haunting, mesmorizing beautiful music will stay with you just as the Lord of the Rings music did. The dwarves march is my favorite, so moving and powerful. And I'm also crazy about the song, Misty Mountains, and am interested in purchasing more of Neil Finn's music, loved his performance very much.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is a very fun game but the only bad thing is that it takes a long time to load and it is a little angering
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Angry Bird is strange to an old guy like myself but I have to say I have enjoyed this one for hours.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I have heard the artists' music performed over the years, but this is probably my first recording I have purchased for this artist. I had been going through some issues with my long term mate, and  the music takes me to a place I can relate to. I actually listen to 'Gone baby gone' repeatedly, every time I play the tape. Great technical sound, too!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is so much fun. The graphics are very good, you don't want to put it down. Get it now!!
B007UXT6T6|3.0|Great action sequences...some interesting locations Dubi, India, Budapschest...some one liner zingers and a few issues with a russian telephone.  Not bad for part 4..could be worse.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I can never get enough of The Piano Guys.  I can listen to them all day.  I have to buy two copies of their CDs so that I can have them in my office and my car at the same time.
B001TODCII|1.0|Do not buy this movie if you do not like violence, and sinceless killing.  I thought it would be enjoyable to watch until violence become the whole movie.
B000SO7OL6|4.0|I was looking for something that would highlight the artist's value over time. Longevity has it's place with any artist. I was pleased with the selections. She is a ballad singer, and when the need is quiet and smooth, she works for me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's not to hard, not to easy, very fun. Can't wait for more rooms. Glad there are walk throughs available to get you over the tricky parts
0061733199|5.0|I bought this book based on a book review.  I gave it to a friend who is getting married in New Zealand and then for the Honeymoon she and her husband are going trekking.  I thought it would be a good gift and something they could really use on their Honeymoon.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Really weak story line.  Full of gaping holes, but nice action including a couple of explosive head shots.  Entertaining but not a thinkers movie.
B00005JKG9|1.0|Horrible movie ! You can go with out seeing this one. You would think with this all star line up it would be a winner, wrong ! &#34;Always be closing the case&#34; and putting this thing in the cylindrical filing cabinet.
B000002UVX|5.0|Of all the Hendrix bands, this is the greatest. For a walk down memory lane, this is the best. It has been reproduced to feel as though it could have been performed, yesterday. It sounds better than when I first heard it. It still inspires!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is a Legend, and an amazing performer. He has a beautiful spirit, and I love his music.I would highly recommend this product, I loved the presentation.
B008JFUQ16|5.0|There are so many animated movies that come out each year now that it's tough to pick where to put your money.  Back in 2010, this was definitely the case, with movies like Alpha & Omega, Shrek Forever, Megamind, Guardians, etc. hitting the theater (aside from the must see movies, like Toy Story 3).  That summer, we decided to put some of our chips on Despicable Me, thanks to Steve Carell voicing the main character, Gru, and the little yellow Minions that we saw in the trailer.<br /><br />Who knew that the Minions would be so damn funny?<br /><br />Needless to say, Despicable Me was a huge hit, mostly on the strength of the heart of the story and the antics of the Minions.  Shortly after it's release, it was announced that there would be a sequel.  Excitement.  This followed with some teasers, a trailer, and finally, this weekend, it's here.<br /><br />Despicable Me 2 takes a different direction from the first, showing Gru as a caring family man.  This time, he's recruited to help take on a new villain named Big Macho.  There aren't many surprises coming from the story here.  It's quite predicable and doesn't surprise on any beat.  The voice work is serviceable, with Carell delivering and Wiig...hanging in there.  However...is it funny?  Heck yeah it is.  The Minions DELIVER.  There are several gags which I won't spoil, but they are arguably more funny than they were in the first one.  Several scenes had us (and the entire theater) laughing out loud, including one guy who laughed the loudest that I've ever heard in a theater (honestly, it made the movie even funnier).<br /><br />Bottom line...the kids will love it, and you'll probably love it too.  After the movie, it's teased that there will be a Minion movie (not a surprise, already announced), and I simply cannot wait for that.  The Minions are turning Despicable Me into one of the funniest animated franchises of all time.<br /><br />Final Score: 5/5
B00908DDZM|1.0|I really didn't care for this album. I thought it would have tracks similar to \\"thrift shop\\" and \\"can't hold us\\"... I can't even listen to the other stuff.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish had more to figure out. They werent easy, made you think. Good game cant wait for more games to continue.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|Fabulous book - I bought the first one a few years ago - and now I give it to people I think might benefit from help cleaning and organizing - great fun to read - wonderful - thank you Marla Cilley!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|One of the best games I have played in a while try and find out for yourself trust me you won't regret getting this game
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Thought this was going to be another great adventure but it quickly turned into too many HO games so close together that the fun part of the adventure was lost. When you found a key or figured out a mechanism the fun part is watching it work but you don't get to see it. I suppose it is my fault...I should have looked at the file size of this game. I'm bored so I will finish it a chapter here and there. If it picks up and gets better I will return and add more stars but  3 stars is being generous for a game that moves too slow for a person of my age which is ...ah...like fine wine!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good graphics I would recomend it. you can interact with the horse and groom it and give the horse treats
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Cool book. Thought provoking.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who is confused about their relationship. I must have and read.

B00CWVGBEO|3.0|The flick was a good B mpvie, just that, nothing more. A.S. has never done anything else. This was not his worse but not his best. It was good to see him again. By the way 66 is NOT old! How do I know you may ask , I am 66! Be very careful who you call old kids,when you are here it's kind of a inside joke just between us \\"old guys\\". Hope you don't find out the hard way! Do be careful out there kids! Anyway you may want to wait for the price to go down or catch it on tv for free,for sure rent it don't buy it. Guess I will take A nap now after all this typing I am worn out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun, it has really good graphics, very addictive, and even toddlers love to play, i highly suggest this as game to get. Well done Kiloo. :)

B0020BUWX2|5.0|This was an amazing book.  I really felt as if.I was in Mia's shoes. You hot to feel not only her. Emotions bat also all of those around her. I loved this book so much.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Great gift set the classic black and white and a color copy. I only want to watch it in the black and white format but my wife enjoyed seeing it colorized. Great quality and fast shipping
B00C3ALLZ8|2.0|This review is for the \\"Olive Films\\" Blu-ray only.  I would happily give the movie five stars, its one of my favorites, but after waiting for years and years for a widescreen version, \\"Olive\\" releases this huge disappointment.  The Blu-ray has less picture material than the full screen version.  Its EXACTLY the same as the full screen version but with the top and bottom cropped off to fit it to the wide screen.  Side to side is exactly the same, no extra picture.  The only reason I gave it two stare instead of one is because the transfer is beautiful, very clear and sharp, but of course, one expects that from Blu-ray.  So, if you want the most picture, buy the full-screen DVD version.  Mine is the one from \\"Republic Pictures.\\"  I would only recommend the \\"Olive Films\\" Blu-ray for its H-D sharpness and if you don't mind the tops of peoples heads going out of the frame.  I don't know, but reading the description of the \\"Olive Films\\" recent DVD release of this film, it appears they've also done the same butcher crop job on it too.  It claims the same 1.85:1 \\"widescreen\\" ratio. This makes the full screen DVD version the only DVD version to buy.  If you still want wide screen on that, just use the TV's zoom function.
B00A8307BG|5.0|As a longtime Trower fan I've come to be skeptical about his new releases. This album knocked the skepticism right out of me on first listen. Trower's vocals were surprisingly good and his bass players vocals had a James Dewar quality to them. Trower fans pickup this album. Guitar fans pickup this album. You wont be disappointed. I wasn't.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and I got the update very cool but next update can we spawn dogs cats and people and horses that would make my stable complete. and mange the nether porter. and night time.  and one last thing. making a rollarcoaster that would be very cool
B000V4NX04|5.0|Great film in warning of the dangers of too much state intervention in the lives of individuals. Also showed how corrupt the East German government was and why it collapsed.
B009X01C64|4.0|It is OK. Does the job of protecting. Swivel is good. Only bad thing is: in hot weather, while you carry it in hand, there is some sweating.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|I may be getting too sentimental in my old age but this film was so touching that I actually cried through quite a bit of it. What I found so touching was how essentially good almost all the characters were.<br /><br />The central character Jacob Pederson (Mads Mikkelsen) despite a nearly constant scowl on his face or a look of deep concern and perhaps worry is a man who really cares about right and wrong and other people. This is a sharp change from his misspent youth when all he cared about were...well what many of us cared about, having a good time. Now he runs an orphanage in Mumbai.<br /><br />While Jacob is the central character the most interesting character and the one with the biggest heart is the very rich Jorgen Lennart Hannson (Rolf Lassgard). Jacob has gone to Denmark to convince Jorgen to support his orphanage. It isn't clear that Jorgen will do so. He has choices for charity. But when Jorgen invites Jacob to his daughter's elaborate wedding, things change.<br /><br />I won't say any more about the plot since it is such an interesting and surprising plot. What I will say is that when Jorgen learns who Jacob really is in relationship to his family (and vice-versa!) he does something so caring, so surprising and so correct and so magnanimous that it will warm the cockles of the coldest heart and bring to tears the most cynical of viewers.<br /><br />And then we are back to Jacob and how he deals with what Jorgen has concocted. And he too does the right thing even though it completely changes his life and costs him something dear to his heart..<br /><br />I wish I could be more concrete. But see the film and I think you'll agree that this is the kind of movie that will make you feel good about people. It's a shame that it's rated \\"R.\\" Perhaps if you have a tweener or even a bright 10-year-old you can watch it together. And you can talk about it. It is a great relationship film, and a great film for teaching young people about the real choices in life that can come up<br /><br />The acting was excellent. Mikkelsen brought the strength of character and a justified pride to the role of Jacob while Lassgard was warm and real and smart as Jorgen. Both Sidse Babett Knudsen, who played Jorgen's wife, and Stine Fischer Christensen, who played the bride, were intense and so vivid I felt I could touch them. (The intense close-ups on the eyes and faces--and I mean intense--made the actors almost leap off the screen.) But most of my praise must go to Susanne Bier who wrote the story and directed and to Anders Thomas Jensen who wrote the screenplay. The story and the movie are simply brilliant.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of the movie review collection, \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\"can come up<br /><br />The acting was excellent.

B0091THRCU|3.0|In general it is a good quality item, price is affordable.  Fits perfectly for my new iPhone 5. good look also.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Great in showing the other side of war. Being away from loved ones, sincere care for those under your command. Also the trials and tribulations of being a submariner.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I usually read a book Before I see a movie, but this is one time I did it backwards. There is quite a difference between the two. Yet, the difference is great. The back story only makes the movie much more enjoyable.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is one of the best hidden object puzzles I have played!  you find pieces of tools you need to work toward solving the arching storyline!  Lots of beautifully created scenes, well worth 99 cents!
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|My 20-something kids made me watch this. I was reluctant but. . . . . . . okay, so I loved it. It's hilarious and gory. My taste in films is fairly eclectic, all the way from Pulp Fiction to The English Patient, so there's room for odd films. The premise: two &#34;backwoods&#34; guys decide to go camping and all hell breaks loose when they cross paths with a group of young people near their cabin. There are no bad guys - it's not that type of film (i.e. it's not a slasher flick). but it's got plenty of bloodshed, much of it quite funny.  This isn't for everyone, but I've now watched it three times because we'll have people over who haven't seen it and it's fun to see their reactions.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This style of album hearkens back to their old concept albums.  They used to spend the entire album telling a single story with very long songs, so the radio stations didn't play them.  There was just not enough breaks for commercials.  This album is the best of both worlds. It's a concept album, and I am hard pressed to think of anyone that can do that better than Rush, but the songs are good as stand alone singles.  My only complaint is that this isn't getting radio time (and I live in Chicago so it's a big market).<br /><br />The more I listen to this, the more I like it.  I've loved all their albums, but there is something extra special in this one. Even if you are only a little bit of a Rush fan, you should buy this. You will NOT be disappointed.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is cool because you get to adjust the power to shoot with simple and fast  Very cool. Some of the other ones,are not kindle ready so very cool indeed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has FANTASTIC graphics! Also, the music is so awesome! If you love the temple run series, you,'ll love this! Total buy!
B008P9M614|5.0|I just had to have it on a hard copy, for keeping, also i'm gonna watch it al over again for a second time, it's the only show that i watch twice.

B001P06GX4|5.0|Blockus is my to to game for young children. The shapes are fun and the rules are simple to understand. Kids need to think spacially to find placement solutions. Most fun when played by 2 children or three or more all ages.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Bought this on sale for .99c before they got big! Saw them live at Bonnaroo this year! They were awesome!!!! Sounds just as great live as they do on their CD & not many people/bands can say that nowadays!
0393061310|4.0|All i have to say is that I find it absolutely pathetic that some of these one star reviewers actually have the time to write for an hour or two about how horrible this book is, and I know that some you spent even more time than that. Most of these claims you make are just misinterpretations on your part. And as far as peoples IQs lowering because of TV, I propose they also are reduced from reading misguided rants from people who fail to understand what a 'Theory' actually is... Thanx fer youre hellp...
B008D37J6O|3.0|I do not know if the skips in video and audio when I try to play *.mov files downloaded to the tablet from a PC where they play perfectly are due to the tablet's failure to display large 1080P files or it is due to problems with HD player. Can you please suggest test(s) that I could do to see if the skipping is a hardware or software problem? I have not tried any other Android apps that claim to display 1080P *.MOV files. Thank you.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have been enjoying this app for several months. I like the way I can customize my sound groupings and save them. I use the timer feature regularly. Nice variety of sounds. This was just what I was looking for!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|It stinks you have to buy this as an accessory, I think it should come with the camera.<br />But it serves it's purpose, it is easy to use, Touch-screen is pretty sensitive so you're not trying to hit the same button over and over.<br />It does drain the battery, so I only hook it up if I need to review pictures/videos right away.<br /><br />Other than that, great product.
0765365278|1.0|I had high hopes for this book because or the last Wheel of Time books Sanderson co-wrote, and the other Sanderson books I read. This book is redundant, too slow, redundant (did mention redundant) and the only payoff is at the end. I will not read anymore of this series.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I was very hesitant to buy this album because the 30 second samples I listened to were not very compelling. At least not compelling enough to spend eleven dollars on a new album. However, I have always liked Daft Punk I kept coming back to Random Access Memories trying to decide. I finally bought it and I am in love with it. Note: buy the whole album; Get Lucky is really good and everyone's heard it but the album as a whole is a well crafted and varied story the works very well together. I've been using this album as my workout music, working music, and then I turn the volume down and go to sleep listening to it. I highly recommend this buy.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|It was brutal! But those were brutal times! I had to get up and leave the room sometimes if it was just too much for me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this after hearing about it from a friend. I heard they were making a movie of it so I had to read it first, the books are always better.<br /><br />It was a great read. Came in perfect condition. No complaints.
0765325950|5.0|I read it and listened to it and I still can't get enough. This book is a wonderful payoff to all of the loyal readers. Truly a wonderful reading experience.

B0078ZTWP4|3.0|I have used this lantern for a year of scouting camp outs and it has done very well.  Still on the same batteries. Unfortunately one set of contacts in the battery compartment broke making the lantern unusable.  Supplier has no parts and warranty expired at 30 days. It is a shame. After analyzing the problem I have concluded that the part had to be bent very sharply and the metal is too brittle to maintain that almost 180 degree bend and so it broke under a year's stress of contact compression with the battery. Otherwise the performance of the lantern should be a 5 star. I will try to do my own modification to get the lamp working again.
B005VT42BS|5.0|this is a great tool to have for keeping your network safe from intruders and also to check your network IP address on your cell phone that is capable of surfing the internet.

B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Score is always integral part of a film. Since John William's 1978 Superman theme, it was impossibly difficult to shake it out of our head. No other words to describe it. \\"Iconic\\". But that was 35 years ago. When they used it on Superman Returns 7 years ago, it was still a fit because of the continuity. But now, would you like to expect the Superman March to be featured in action with Chris Nolan's and Zack Snyder's version of Superman? Certainly not. The content of the film would not suit the music. Hans Zimmer is the perfect choice for Man of Steel. His score certainly lacks the optimism of William's score, but Zimmer crafted another beast. His score is perfectly emotional, sometimes atmospheric, and not to mention thunderous. I can't really fathom why so many critics hated this score. Like the film itself which I think did a great job on re-inventing the character, the score did the same thing. And listening to this score, you can probably dive inside Superman's emotions. Just simply: EPIC.<br />There are several tracks I think are the standout tracks:<br />1. Look to the Stars<br />2. Goodbye My Son<br />3. If You Loved These People<br />4. Krypton's Last<br />5. Flight<br />6. What Are You Going to do When You Are Not Saving the World.<br /><br />Of course, this soundtrack's packaging is a plus, and the bonuses. I read on the internet that the bonuses include postcards, stickers, a booklet, and a voucher to redeem the DTS X tracks. But I only found the booklet and the voucher. Where the hell are the others? And not to mention when I downloaded the DTS X tracks to my iPod, it was initially successful. But when I turned my iPod off, and Turned it on again, the tracks are gone! Nice product but lame bonuses. But still it's a four-star product for me....
B00CELB98U|5.0|The remixes of this single are awesome. The remix of Goodbye is awesome. Amazon makes the purchase of music easier than ever.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is a most enjoyable CD, full of romantic songs, and the perfect music to cook by.  I put this on, get out the pasta and wine, and have a great evening with the one I love.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars is my favorite movie, so I may be a little bias. But I have to say this box set is what any SW fan needs in their movie collection.
B00CB4ET0K|1.0|This game was a total ripoff I hate.I froze on me at the tital. I was sitting here for<br />literally 3:04 min. it was hard so I deleted it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really like this game. Easy to learn and play. Would recommend this game if you want challenges but not frustrating. Great game.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It might be a children's book, but this is really beautiful, with two children's lives changing as they discover a secret walled garden that's been left untouched for years.  There's something very moving and touching about it - good for all ages!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the kind of movie you never get tired of.  I love it, plot, effects, action...  Marvel did a very good one here!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|My son rented it after another movie scared the pants off me.<br /><br />This movie was GREAT!!! I think the negative reviews are because of the way it was marketed. When you see Seth, you do think HEAVY comedy,<br />like in his film \\"This is the End\\" that's in theatres now. However, that aside, the movie was great. I didn't laugh as much as I thought I would, but<br />I was humored. I enjoyed it and will watch it again after I finish the scary movie now that it's day time.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for every mother and child, even parent and child. Both my son & daughter act as if I work their nerves<br />overtime (and we aren't jewish), and my mother messes my nerves up. This goes to show the development of parent child relationships<br />and I believe this movie will and has made for better parent child relations, because it gives you something to think about.<br /><br />I highly recommend this BUT, this is not a comedy, not full blown (although you may laugh a little).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless turned out to be a favorite of mine, I couldn't put it down. I loved it and can't wait for &#34;Losing Hope&#34; to come out.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I'd been interested in the series for some time, so I joined amazon prime to watch it.  The weather here has been terrible, so I watched the entire season in 1 day.  When I finished, I couldn't wait to start season 2.  It did not disappoint!

I have to get out of it every time I need it to load more feed. it will usually load one or two stories then you have to get out and back in if you want it to load more. took 10 times of getting out and back in to load more than 2 stories tonight. usually I end of losing my temper and just log in using the web page.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|it is very cool.  I like it very much.But I did not give it a 5 star.It is kind of oldish and chessey
B003VS0CX8|4.0|Terrific film to begin with...adding in the latest HD transfer and 7.1 sound makes Salzburg and the wonderful cast jump off the screen and fill your viewing room with the melodic Rogers and Hammerstein score. Lots of extras of behind the scenes, making of, cast interviews, etc. Well worth the cost even if you already own it.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Nicely written, keeps your attention.  The movie character (in Dragon Tattoo) is perfect for the part.. tho it is a bit difficult to keep track of the book's characters, since their names are hard to pronounce and/or to remember (similarly spelled).  But the action is written well..  nothing seems to be left out.  GOT to find the book 3  :)
0671646788|5.0|this is a great product and I would definently reorder should the need arise. Excellent fast shipping. extremely pleased. thanks. Hate being forced to write wordy reviews when they are not necessary. Saw this on the Steve Harvey show love it.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|It is okay. But there are lots of problem. You can't lean. And it starts to glich up my kindle fire.So I think am going to unintall it .I haven't decided yet.So I wouldn't buy it.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Loved this movie liiked their acting way better than 2007 version and great quality hq and easy to watch and free!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book to me.  I never knew there was actually a language of flowers in the Victorian Era.  The main character is a heroine and she victoriously meets her challenges in life.  I wondered how the book would end, I was in suspense during the last chapters.  I was happy the ending of the story worked well.  Not only did I enjoy the story but the dictionary of flowers at the end and their meaning gave a reference as to how &#34;to speak with flowers&#34;.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This will not be long, because so many others on there have portrayed my feelings about this fantastic book...but one thing I will mention;  This book is for everyone!  Our eyes must be opened to the level of mental illness that surrounds us each and everyday, and without getting a look into the dangers that untreated mental illness presents, we will never address it adequately.  Aside from that, I hail Jaycee and her mom as two of the biggest modern day heroes alive.  I would love to read a book that is written by her mom and get the perspective of what went on in her life during those 18 years that she never gave up hope.<br />Thank you Jaycee for your courage to write this compelling book that let us into the horrors of your world during that time of your life.  God brings good from every situation, and for you it is your two beautiful daughters.  May your life be filled with all the happiness and love that you and your family so deserve.

B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is one I've always liked.  It is a just another game of dominoes.  Always a fun game and a great game to teach how to think.
1490313370|5.0|Choose Yourself is an excellent book and has become my favourite book by James Altucher.<br /><br />The central theme is that the middle class is being destroyed, the job market won't get better, the only solution to living the life you want is entrepreneurship. In order to do it successfully you need a stable base, a value adding paradigm, and the willingness to fail. His personal story is inspiring and is the testament to the theme of book. He's started over 20 businesses, traded with the world's best traders, ran hedge funds and funds of funds, published and sold 11 books. Rags to riches 3x... Very successful guy with experience based lessons. He goes through it all in the book. James' conversational writing style makes for a quick and enjoyable read, and he's hilarious too!<br /><br />Great story. Great concepts. Great read!<br /><br />Buy it. Enjoy it. Implement the concepts. Send it to your friends.<br /><br />Mario Nucci, MD
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Bought this mic so I could do videos for YouTube. Overall, loved its quality. Worked well for me. What I didn't like is that the small foam mic wind piece would not stay on and I soon lost it somewhere around the house. Cord is nice and long, but sooner I will need to upgrade to a wireless mic or the types of videos I do. But overall, great low-cost option!
0811879542|5.0|Purchased this for my three year old granddaughter.  She had been introduced to it on her mother's phone through some type of game along the same lines as this book.  She wasn't as taken up with it as I was.  However, another granddaughter who is two years old absolutely loved it and wanted it read to her again and again and again!  What a fantastic book for so many ages!  Very clever and unique!
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I didn't think this series would be so attention grabbing, but so far I've read 5 of the books in less than a month. Hard to put down!! =)
B000OVLBFS|4.0|I like Tom Selleck in general so I liked this series also. The first in this series was Night Passages and it is little depressing at times because of his personal struggles (the character is an alcoholic and the loss of &#34;Boomer&#34; (his dog) .But Selleck's characters are usually down to earth, honest and with a dry sense of humor....and manly....!!!
B0016BP0PW|4.0|This was a totally unexpected treat, and I was able to stream it for the bargain price of a buck.  I'm not usually a fan of musicals, especially after trying to watch \\"Les Miserables\\". \\"Across the Universe\\" is the exact opposite of that stinker. It's a musical that really works! The Beatles songs are creatively intertwined with an engaging storyline into a entertaining whole. The use of music is vibrant yet subtle. With very little spoken dialogue, the cast sings versions of Beatles songs to support the action on screen. Frequently only a portion of a particular song is used, and it never seems silly when one of the characters bursts into song. The music is introduced so cleverly that it seems natural. There are no overblown production numbers of the kind used in musicals of the past. Loosly based on historical events of the 60s and 70s, the film is undeniably a fantasy, and a love story at heart. The visuals are intriguing and the voices are beautiful, clear and true. I highly recommend this film.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I love how quickly the game become total chaos.  It really cracks me up with its mildly irreverent humor.  One of the funniest games I have ever played.
1439156816|4.0|The guy clearly knows how to write, and he has interesting viewpoints on writing and everything else.<br />However, if you have read a few books about writing, this book will not give you any secrets you have not heard already.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|JT sounds as beautiful as he looks. No other comment necessary. And what the heck, if you want me to rate a product don't make me write novel.
1250012570|3.0|I have seen so many good reviews on this books and I bought it with high expectations. I was sadly let down as I finished through the book which was sometimes a struggle. There were some moments that I really thought were adorable but I just could not get over how annoying Eleanor was. I felt bad for Park because she would constantly get angry or upset over nothing and would whine.<br />Her family situation was terrible, yes, but she did nothing to help her family out. She could have confided in someone to help get her family out of the bad situation.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book nor would I reread it.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Seriously..... I know that typically a movie made based on a book leaves much to be desired, but this movie absolutely sucked! I can't believe they were allowed to use the title \\"Beautiful Creatures.\\" I was extremely disappointed. I don't think that I would have enjoyed this movie even if I hadn't read the book.
1442352604|5.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter is an absolute treat. The fascinating women from the time of the war of the roses are truly amazingly strong. We can't even imagine being told what to do, who to marry, etc. Their courage is commendable. I love the way Philippa creates the story-line for actual real time events of the past. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|What a great movie. Though it is black and white, the message is quite clear. If you think you're going through hell, this movie will give you a lot of reason to be thankful for the things you have.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Really felt like it was a good movie but overall I'm not that into the wizard of oz... Great story. Good couple of twists and great ending as far as I'm concerned ... Graphics were well done in my opinion and overall I enjoyed the movie...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so much better than the movie, without a doubt!! Getting ready to read the next one!! Awesome!!

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Nice! This game is much harder than Spider Man but it has a great feel for what the movie is.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|An intriguing read that kept me engaged in the lives of the characters. Some stories never wrapped up, so I'm expecting a stand alone continuation.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Easy read. Some plot twists and turns. This is a good vacation or beach book. would be a good made for tv movie.
B004G6009U|5.0|Even my 7 year old son will sit down and watch this movie.  It's cute and my daughter absolutely loves it.
B004X75RK4|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Have watched it many times and each time it gets better and funnier. Will watch it again and again
0812982622|5.0|Now that I've had some time to absorb the fascinating plot, great characters and details of life in north Korea that are by turn horrifying and hilarious, I'm ready to start over on page one. There is so much richness, complexity, depth, comedy, sorrow and humanity in this novel that I'm sure if I read it again I would pick up on things I missed the first time through. I was very impressed with the way in which the author weaves together absurd cultural details that are all the more shocking for their almost casual inclusion.
B00005N5S5|5.0|El envío fue inmediato, llegaron en muy buenas condiciones a mi país Venezuela. Lo único malo fue que no pude verla en mi reproductor de dvd por incompatibilidad de región, pero por lo menos pude verlas en mi pc....
B000H6FE1M|5.0|I received a Very Nice Piece of Collection!<br />Schleich really does a nice collection work.<br />I am Very happy about it!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I think this would open the eyes of many if it were required in high school.<br /><br />As a movie it is quickly paced with lots of  confusion and intrigue. The horrors are just that. The characters are well developed. While there is no question about what is right and what is wrong, each person is seen as a whole, not a caricature.<br /><br />Recommend whole heartedly.
074401493X|4.0|I bought this guide mainly for the Firefly keychain and to have another product from one of my favorite games in recent memory. I beat the game once on my own and figured I could use this guide on my second playthrough for help in getting collectibles, trophies, etc. The guide features maps for every section of the single player with the locations of items in the area. I was using just the picture of the maps for the locations of the collectibles until I found one that wasn't detailed on the map. If you read every page of the single player walkthrough, you won't miss any collectibles seeing as they are pointed out throughout your journey. There is also a section of the guide that lists all the collectibles and their locations in consecutive order. I was going for a trophy that requires you to perform certain actions across the length of the story. After beating the game a second time and knowing I followed the guide perfectly, I was puzzled to not receive the trophy. I then browsed videos online to see if I missed any. There was one that I did miss and there is no mention of it in the guide whatsoever.(In the single player walkthrough or on the list of how to get this throphy.) Not a big deal but a little annoying. It's a great looking book but has a few flaws in the information it provides.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|True to Sparks' other great books, this love story is one that was a great read and makes you believe in true love.
B007FJUP2W|3.0|Love the look, hate the fit.  I had been wanting Toms for a while now finally had the extra money to spend and bought them.  They fit snug in store but was told they would stretch.  After three wears in ungodly pain and the skin off the tops of my baby toes I decided they had to go back.  I don't have wide or big feet, they just weren't for me, they didn't stretch...sadly disappointed.  I guess it you have really narrow feet these will work for you, never owned a pair of shoes that ripped my skin off.
B000YMQI6E|4.0|Love the twists and turns this hunt for incriminating evidence takes and the battle between the two men, the slick lawyer and master manipulator. Won't be sorry if you spend an evening watching this.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|My son enjoyed the game but it drained my kindle fire to the point where it wouldn't even turn on without several hours on the charger.  And this was after less than 30 mins of play time!
B005LAIISA|3.0|This movie was pretty good. I didn't think it was as good as the first ones but it still served for a pretty funny movie. It was funny just the plot was kind of eh. They just get lost and find there way back home is all. But Sid and Manny as well as Diego are all funny when there mad at each other and make remarks to each other haha.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game.  fun to find hidden items.  challenge to get to the next level.  keeps you motivated but not to hard.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Cloud Atlas is an incredible movie, but it does require patience and focus.  The beginning scenes are somewhat confusing, and it could be easy to get lost in the first half of the movie.  Six separate storylines spanning five centuries is ambitious, to say the least.<br /><br />But it's well worth the challenge.  There is so much hidden intrigue, and the relationship between the stories multiplies the depth.  Each story is unique; they range from humorous to horrific and mundane to magical.  Again, the presence of so many interwoven tales will create problems for moviegoers more acclimated to high-budget action flicks and comedic farces.  Cloud Atlas has a complex plot that is more important than the special effects, but that's often the opposite of what the general public wants.<br /><br />There's a fascinating synergy here between the different timelines that is unlike anything I can remember.  When I finished watching the movie the first time through, I was left with burning questions.  I wondered, \\"What does it all mean?\\"  So I thought about it a while, then watched Cloud Atlas again.  And I enjoyed it even more.

B004KO8036|5.0|Confession time: This reviewer knows very little about the Oregon band Red Fang. But hey, that doesn't really matter, because with their second full-length, they certainly got my attention! 2011's \\"Murder The Mountains\\" is a quality of slab of sludge/doom/stoner metal, and one that is filled with the good stuff. Sure, the band is rooted in era Black Sabbath-indebted guitar riffing, but there is much more to their sound than just that. Like solid melodies, brutal bass lines, energetic and dexterous drumming, and rambunctious, sludge-filled grooves. And plus, the guitar tone is so thick and brutal in these ten songs that it actually sometimes takes the album to near grindcore-levels of heaviness.<br /><br />The band proudly wears a strong Mastodon influence on its sleeve throughout \\"Murder The Mountains.\\" In fact, the opener, \\"Malverde,\\" could very well be an early Mastodon (or Baroness) b-side, as it mainly revolves around walls of sludgy, Sabbath-on-steroids-esque guitars, steady bass lines, dexterous, bouncy drum fills, and oh-so-Troy Sanders-ish vocals. With that said, though, track two, \\"Wires,\\" with its heavy, sludgy, downtuned guitar and bass rumbles, is very, very Queens Of The Stone Age-esque. It does retain some influence from other bands, though, including Mastodon (mainly in the vocals), \\"Paranoid\\"-era Sabbath-derived grooves, and drumming that would make The Melvins proud. And \\"Hank Is Dead\\" continues in this same vein, as it finds a gluey, flowing, and propulsive bass groove underlying Sabbath-y sludge riffs, and churning, lumbering, pounding rhythms. (This tune is a highlight, though, for also featuring a bluesy, harmonic guitar solo, to boot.) And so does the ensuing fourth track, \\"Dirt Wizard,\\" which has thundering, densely crunching guitars and noteworthy (and almost funky-sounding) bass lines coursing throughout.<br /><br />Later on, we are treated to a deft, tight, and precise drum fill/introductory drum solo in the beginning of \\"Painted Parade.\\" This is before, however, the song segues into brutal sludge/doom territory where massively thunderous and pounding riffage takes over center stage. And \\"Number Thirteen\\" is another large standout track because it begins with some nicely melodic picking and ominously grumbling, grungy-sounding bass lines, before slamming into pure doom metal territory with brutal (yet oddly hummable), and towering doom-laden riffs and nifty bass fills. Some melodic guitar leads crop up here and there throughout \\"Number Thirteen,\\" too, thus allowing the tune's verses to flow perfectly into its really catchy and memorable choruses. Next in line is \\"Into The Eye,\\" which has Sabbath-gone-haywire picking and bullying, Mastodon-worthy grooves abounding throughout, as does a rhythmically martial-sounding drum beat.<br /><br />Then comes \\"The Undertow,\\" a song that plays like a piece of Deep Purple-meets-Eyehategod-meets-Cathedral-esque sludge metal, and one that is highlighted by a Motorhead-reminiscent bass intro and one very hypnotic, trance-inducing, mesmerizingly repetitive stoner metal riff backed up by heavy bass lines. But even though the guitars and bass are especially heavy throughout \\"The Undertow,\\" which is a largely-instrumental epic, it is actually a surprisingly melodic piece (mainly thanks to its use of pleasantly harmonic guitar leads). And the closing \\"Human Herd\\" is another noteworthy inclusion, as it marries catchy vocal patterns (including a soaring refrain) with inventive, crunchy, galloping guitar licks and more heavy, gutturally-grumbling bass fills.<br /><br />But it is the album's centerpiece, \\"Throw Up,\\" that takes the cake for being the set's epic. Its ominously doomy and brooding bass intro flows perfectly into crunchy, driving guitar and bass riffs, thus creating doomy, meaty, and crunching piece of sludge metal. The tune also has a fast tempo change at around the three-minute-and-forty-second mark, thus taking it to up-tempo territory with brisk, chug and churnguitar leads and surprisingly deft and quick drumming. With that said, though, \\"Throw Up\\" is mostly of note for having an epic playing time (it clocks in at roughly seven-whole minutes in length.)<br /><br />\\"Murder The Mountains\\" might lose out to the almighty Mastodon (and their 2011 release, \\"The Hunter\\") for being the year's best sludge/doom metal record, but if so, then just barely. And regardless of comparisons to fellow Sabbath-worshipping heavyweights, when taken on its own terms, \\"Murder...\\" is an excellent all-around sophomoric effort from Red Fang, who are definitely a very skilled and promising young group, and one that is most certainly on to something big (check that, huge), here.guitar leads and surprisingly deft and quick drumming.

B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I've played the previous Quell games ([[ASIN:B0055SWM08 Quell]], [[ASIN:B006OOHYIC Quell Reflect]]) and I was so excited when Memento came out. It played glitch free and the increase in game challenges and types of obstacles are a big plus from the previous games.<br /><br />It is visually beautiful and, like the other Quell games, the music is relaxing ([[ASIN:B00AGB9REI The Quell Collection]]).<br /><br />Like the other Quell games, the object is to move the raindrop to collect pearls and avoid pitfalls. In Quell Memento, you also need to use the raindrop to illuminate diamonds of matching colors. There are fog areas that stop the light from continuing and hidden jewels in every level. There are 24 hidden levels (time warps) that coincide with each hour of the clock.<br /><br />There are hours of game play with tons of great visual effects and sharp, colorful graphics.

U only have the radar and an arrow to show you where the enemy is, nothing to help you locate them in a 3D environment. Good graphics and response, especially for the price.

Not like hill climb racing or candy crush where anyone can play and have fun right off the bat. If I wanted a realistic type game, this would be the one. Our military pilots r awesome!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much that I played it 24 7 and the thing that I love about this game is how you fight the enemies of Gru.
B008A36R2Y|5.0|Well in truth there's only one uart but has a virtual serial port (usb) that's infinitely useful in debugging apps where the uart serial is in use. I will be buying Leonardos from now on or perhaps the mega clones from China which even lower cost.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of thinking involved and hours of fun. Feeling of satisfaction and pride<br />  undeniable when you get the door open.  A help guide would be appreciated if needed.<br />This puzzle good for all ages.  I'm a 71 year old grandmother and I love the challenge although I admit my grandson had to help me in 2 rooms so a guide would be nice.  Thanks for this puzzle.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|This movie is good but not great.  I bought it because I saw Dustin Hoffman on the Charlie Rose show and it intrigued me.  I was not disappointed.  The cast if very good and the story of interest to retired people today.  I think people of a certain age would enjoy it.
1400069742|4.0|For those who think that today's ferociously  partisan atmosphere in Washington is new, reading Lynne Olson's book will be an eye-opener.  She does a fine job of recounting the bitter arguments over prospective US involvement in WW2 before Pearl Harbor.  While the focus of the title is on Lindbergh and Roosevelt, there is actually a lot more emphasis on Lindbergh, not just Charles, but his wife Anne, who comes across as much more interesting of the two.  Roosevelt is portrayed as a surprisingly cautious player in the national debate, &#34;leading from behind&#34;, to use the phrase of the past few years, after having been pummeled politically in the &#34;court packing&#34; fight in 1937-8.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Over the years I have figured out that from time-to-time I \\"get too busy.\\" It's obvious when I reach that point because I get cranky, start inadvertently missing meetings that are in my calendar and generally have very low energy. I then go through a process of what I've been calling \\"reset to zero.\\" By this I mean that I drop out of all nonessential groups and activities, decline most requests for socializing and make sure that any meetings I do attended are critical; ditching the others. I didn't think much about this self-imposed process until recently. My reading in neuroscience led to deeper understanding of how our brains work. My reading in neuropsychology and coaching gave me some insights into personality traits. Among those understandings came the revelation that at heart, despite my many public activities, I am an introvert. And then Susan Cain's excellent book Quiet, was recommended to me. It is perhaps the clearest and most practical of the works I've read that are focused on the continuum of introversion and extroversion.<br /><br />According to Cain, \\"At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams.\\" There are many ramifications to understanding how our society emphasizes action versus contemplation, being extroverted over being introverted and quickly taking risks rather than measuring risk carefully. One very important lesson I gathered from Quiet was to be much more cognizant of how our children and young people are being acclimated to the preference our society has for extroversion.<br /><br />Much of what I have learned from reading about Cain's research I will put to work in my coaching practice. Some of the ideas for immediate use in my work are:<br />  1. Our work environments must be made safe for those on the introverted side of the spectrum<br />  2. Our educational institutions are \\"death\\" for those who tend to introversion - must change<br />  3. Everyone has the right to reticence - resist the temptation to require all to participate<br />  4. True innovation rarely comes from brainstorming - have people work alone first<br />  5. Be sure to provide quiet time for those who need it - our society is very noisy and fast paced<br /><br />Cain is meticulous about letting the reader know when she is taking an educated guess about why people react the way they do. She also cites the scientific data and research data as well. She uses many personal anecdotes along with other personal stories of real people in everyday circumstance. I encourage every parent and every leader to read this book and understand the implications of what Cain is sharing with us. We will certainly be creating a better environment for ourselves and a safe culture in our organizations if we embrace the teachings in this excellent book.Our educational institutions are \\"death\\" for those who tend to introversion - must change<br />  3.

B000002J03|5.0|My words will not be adequate to convey what this recording expresses to the listener. Original Led Zep fans don't need this review, and those who did not live through their early years might not get it.  This album is like a crucible of hard Rock n Roll genesis; witness the metamorphosis of seminal blues tunes into what becomes a signature and iconic Rock n Roll sound. Timeless, amazing, incredible, dynamic, are just some the adjectives which come to mind, but fall short describing the early Zeppelin sound; this equally applies to their first album too!
B001GLYMK6|1.0|Heard a lot n rented this one but turns out to be unbelievably irritating !<br />Then I come to know that it's the old Korean version that's nice n not this!
B00846F1YW|5.0|lots of fun puzzles to pass the. time away. puzzles are not to hard to solve. but hard enough to be challenging. have fun with this one. fun for young and old alike.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I thought this game was fun, and challenging in a way that wasn't frustrating.  It was addictive, too.  The problem is, there are only ten levels.  By the time the game got truly challenging, it was over.  It's fine for a free game, but with only ten levels it's not one that I'm going to keep on my Kindle.
0062238868|4.0|Okay, this book won't win any literary awards.  It uses simple words, is straight forward, and is super easy to read.  It mirrors the characters of Chris Kyle to a T.  It reads as if Chris is telling you his stories in his own words.  In that aspect, it is perfect.<br /><br />It is sad that a warrior like Chris, who braved the battlefields for his beloved comrades and country and emerged victorious only to be murdered by a mental case he was trying to help.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was hoping this was more like the Oregon Trail of my childhood with adventures. Nope it's just another version of farmville.  Sure you get shoot things but mainly you are just stuck on one plot of land building a village up.  If that's what you want...I guess it is fine but it wasn't what I was hoping for.  They do spend an annoying amount of time trying to get you to link up with your facebook friends.  The kids like it but I think these games are dumb.
B000NOKA0S|4.0|As always, Leonard entertains to the max.  If you like Leonard Cohen, then you most likely will like this CD.  I would recommend this CD to my friends!

B0042TV4IW|5.0|I missed this series when it was on PBS and was so glad to see that Amazon Prime had it available for free.  It is beautiful to look at, good acting and engrossing and engaging stories.  For Downton Abbey fans, Brendan Coyle (Mr. Bates) is also in this series.  I look forward to watching Seasons 2 and 3.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Wasn't sure this was my type of game but was I ever wrong. it's. easy to play and still challenging. Keep going back to it.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|Loved it!  It was required reading for my high schooler and I chose to read along. He actually finished it before I did!
B001SWA8A6|5.0|I love, love, love this charming book that reaches out and touches the bibliophile in me! Only one who has a life-long love affair with books will truly appreciate this story of the decades' long correspondence between Helene Hanff, a script reader/ writer living in New York, and Frank Doel, the manager of an antiquarian British bookshop, Marks & Co. The correspondence starts in the year 1949 and ends in 1968.<br /><br />These letters reveal two people who shared a similar sense of humor and a passion for old books. Ms. Hanff had a particular fondness for antiquarian books filled with wisdom - the works of John Donne, Samuel Pepys, Newman, Leigh Hunt, Walter Savage Landor, and many others. Despite making little money, Hanff develops such a fondness for the people running the bookshop that she sends them food parcels when she discovers England is being subjected to food rationing in the post-war period.<br /><br />My love for this story is not only because it is about a love of books, but also because it harkens back to a time when people actually took pains to correspond with each other (not that they had a choice), an art that is slowly dying out (I try my best to keep it alive by penning long letters to my parents who live on a different continent and who are blissfully oblivious to the wonders of e-mailing and social networking).<br /><br />84, Charing Cross Road resonates with me on so many levels, and is the perfect read on days when I'd like to just slow down and savor the pleasure of curling up with a light read. The movie adaptation starring Anne Bancroft and Sir Anthony Hopkins is another delight that perfectly captures the essence of the book. Also recommended:<br />Q's Legacy
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Retired folks thrown together at a run-down hotel in India, operated by a guy who tries hard but lacks the life experience to become successful at it on his own. Some of the guests are bitter, some naive, some ill, some heartbroken, and some are just cheerful survivors of whatever life brings them. I work for a Meals-on-Wheels agency in a city of 100,000, and I am old myself, so I recognized all the personality types and found them all credible. Fine acting, fun moments, tear-producing moments too. The most memorable film I've seen in the past six months.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins nails it with The God Delusion.  This book sums up the majority of the argument for secular culture in one neat package.  Dawkins has a very eloquent way of writing, and gets the points across without seeming accusatory to someone that may not yet share his views.  This book doesn't really &#34;hold back&#34; so to speak, but it's also not in your face.  A typical theist would probably be able to make it through this without feeling too aggravated.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I only have to remember one special password to access all my sites and passwords and they have apps for my Android tablet, my iphone and ipad.<br />If they lengthened their tutorial video and slowed down abit to make it more learnable, I would have given it five stars, but it takes a little time to learn how to use it properly
0770435726|5.0|Mildly overwritten at points, otherwise a realistic European background, a varied cast of conniving and egotistical characters, and a surprise-filled twisty story with an impossible-to-anticipate conclusion. I particularly liked the way that espionage and deception are shown as affecting the characters' relationships and personal lives.
B00CDXOXB4|3.0|I was a domestic violence counselor for 24 years, so I know a little bit about the world of abusers and victims. I also know it is almost impossible to run away and permanently hide from a person determined to hurt you. I've seen lots of movies about family violence and read a dozen or more non-fiction treatments of the problem. Therefore, movies such as \\"The Burning Bed\\" and \\"Sleeping With the Enemy\\" and \\"Safe Haven\\" sometimes are problematic for me. In real life, the women in danger are not  usually movie-star attractive, and don't have professional writers giving them good job skills or irresistable personalities. The male abusers are less often respected professionals and more often substance-abusing low self-esteem marginal achievers. Are there exceptions to both of my depictions? Of course. But in domestic violence films, reality is simplified for the sake of a two-hour tale. And as a two-hour tale of a frightened woman's bid to escape an obsessed bully, \\"Safe Haven\\" is enjoyable and tense. No masterpiece, not the finest script ever penned, not the most superb acting you'll see this year, but not a waste of time. The twist ending will seem hokey five minutes after the credits roll, but for me, when it was revealed, it not only worked, it was the best thing about the whole production. I \\"retired\\" from the world of domestic violence prevention more than four years ago, and am glad to be distanced from the ugliness and tragedies of that problem. It's damned hard to reform the abusers, and surprisingly difficult to help victims make permanent, safer, healthier changes and choices. If a movie like this helps one victim decide to get away sensibly, or one abuser elect to get professional help before he ends up in jail or dead, it was worth making and watching.
145162445X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Krauss breaks down some of the fundamental ideas behind the nature of existence, and the formation of the universe, and explains them in terms that anyone can really understand if they pay attention to what they're reading.  I'm an undergrad physics major, so I do have a somewhat more fundamental idea of some of these concepts, but hearing very high level topics in physics explained in simpler terms has given me a lot more motivation to continue my studies.  I'd highly recommend this book.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Well written and well paced! Picked this up on a lark, now I can't wait for more. I highly recommend this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This continues to be an excellent program.  It has good acting and excellent attention to period detail.  The programming represents an example of what good TV can offer.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|The story is less substantial than Maggie Smith's other hit of the past year, \\"Marigold Hotel\\" but this is still enjoyable. My wife and I are old (65 and 68) so we could identify with the characters, even though they were retired opera singers and orchestra members. We saw it via our cable company's \\"on demand HD\\" movie rental option. (We just purchased our first flat-screen set a couple of weeks ago.) The acting is fine, the music is glorious. My father-in-law, age 91, a WW II vet who earned a Silver Star for saving the life of a fellow sailor on a burning ship, just moved in to a fancy retirement palace much like the one depicted here. So we had plenty to recognize and with which to identify. Crotchety personalities abound in the film's world, along with poignant \\"senior moments\\" heralding the probably precipitous declines of a few of the main characters. It is realistic about aging, and the fact that some talented people can indeed still sing well enough in their '70's and '80's. (Check out Tony Bennett and Hal Linden, for instance.)
B0042FZOFU|5.0|All 3 are great flicks for adults and kids.<br />I bought these for my son even though he'll be too young to watch them but I'm hoping he'll enjoy as I have.

B00881VLCE|3.0|Loved this app until new update. Movement of the pieces are jerky and usually grabs wrong piece.  Doesn't happen on other games so not my device.  Like white border on edge pieces and you gave me new puzzles and took others away.  Please fix jerkiness.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am a late-comer to this series of books.  However, I was quickly pulled into this other world that Martin describes so well.  I finished all 4 books in less than 3 weeks, and I can't wait to start on the 5th book of the series.

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I was looking forward to finally getting this new Gaiman book since I am a fan of his work and saw him reading an excerpt of it on CSPAN when he was receiving an award.  The bit he read was very interesting.  Unfortunatly it turned out to be like the previews you see for a movie and when you go to see the movie you realize the previews showed the best parts and the parts of the movie not shown in the previews are just filler material.<br /><br />Started reading it on my Kindle and noticed the % bar was moving to the right very quickly.  The story is short, very short.  Not $12.99 worth of a \\"novel\\".  It reads like the author figured he better put something out quick.  Struck me as a prequel to a bunch of sequels to keep an author in publication because he has ran out of ideas so will stretch a story across many \\"books\\".  This particular story really had no substance to it.  I kept expecting something more to happen.  The boy gets in trouble and is miraculously saved.  The boy gets in trouble and is miraculously saved, etc., etc. It was just OK. Not what was expected from Gaiman.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and easy to use. Any kid who can't have a pet would love to take care of this realistic horse.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|My initial attraction to the book was Alice Sebold's unique mastery of words that produced a riveting first paragraph.  It seized my attention and never let go.  She generously shares excruciating details of a painful event that moved her to fight back, but she also demonstrates that reactions vary drastically according to the individual.  The novel offered interesting revelations about perceptions and processes within the U.S. police and justice system, which is valuable for any reader exposed to similar circumstances.<br /><br />Reading this autobiographical account helped me understand and appreciate Ms. Sebold's choice of subjects in her other books.  The novel is recommended for every woman, but also for men so we can all be aware, vigilant, and empathic.

B008Y7IP0S|4.0|I originally watched this movie as a child -- it was one of the shows I remember watching when having sleepovers with other boys my age.  I re-watched it again this year (2013).  Some parts now seem incredibly cheesy and childish such as the high school romance / drama.  However, the core message of the movie remains strong even after a few decades.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing the student/teacher relationship develop between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi.  I enjoyed seeing Daniel learn to trust and obey his teacher.<br /><br />In short, it's still a fun film to watch even though it is nearly three decades old.
B000002KOO|3.0|I am a BIG blues fan, so I bought the early Mac based on the fact that Peter Green, and John McVie played with Mayall's Bluesbreakers. The Blue Horizon recordings are HOT. This album is good, but you can tell at first listen that the band is departing from their original formula. Songs like Closing My Eyes make me wonder if Peter Green wrote this after too many acid trips. And I've heard Oh Well before, just not the full 8 min plus version which after the Rockin' Blues part sounds like something out of a Mike Oldfield recording (appropriate for Mike Oldfield, but not for a British Blues Group). Jeremy Spencer isn't much help, but Danny Kirwan shines. It's not hard to tell that Peter Green, and Jeremy Spencer would not be with them much longer. It's like the drugs were affecting their performance. This would be their 'Swan Song'. One creative bit credited to Fleetwood, and McVie, were the Madge songs. Very creative, and interesting. Rattlesnake Shake, Before the Beginning, Underway, and Show Biz Blues would all be good if anyone but Peter Green wrote them, But for Peter Green, this is sub par. A lot of critics, and reviewers like this album, but I'm a blues fanatic, so I'll tell you that if you are into the blues, I would still say get it, because it is the last stuff out there with McVie, and Green together, but be prepared to be disappointed.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|This is a very good movie. It is fun to watch and has a good moral to the story for both children and adults.
B0039PPW60|5.0|This little mixer is great. Good price and very clean and quiet. I'm using it in my studio and it's everything they said it would be. I've used some Behringer products in the past so I was familiar with their reputation, that's why I decided to purchase this mixer. I would definitely recommend this product.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I believe this game could be fun but the controls on it need work. It also messed up my touch screen for a bit. After many resets the screen is fine again, I'm not sure how this game could have caused issues. It had been working just fine prior to downloading this game, I have a Fire HD 7\\".<br />  Also, not impressed with the \\"connect to Facebook to get...\\" nor the in-app purchases. I hope (I don't know for sure as I did uninstall the game)you don't need to purchase items to move along in the game or connected to Facebook.

B000NMW6M0|5.0|Babel is a well told story from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu of Amores Perros fame.  Japan, Morroco, and US/Mexico interrelate in this biblical story of power and communication.  The film starts in Morroco with one man buying a rifle to have his 2 sons protect his goat herd from jackals.  The rifle is used by the sons more as a toy than as a tool.  The youngest son is quite the marksman and without real intention hits Kate Blanchett's character in the shoulder area.  Brad Pitt's character communicates, through raw emotion, his desire to save the life of his bleeding wife.  The boys skirt their responsibility for most of the film. It is not until the scene in which a deaf-mute Japanese girl, whose mother committed suicide, stands \\"naked\\" before her father to communicate her emotional pain that the boys admit their part in the shooting and own up to truth to effectively communicate their intent.<br /><br />The rifle serves as a symbol for God's power to affect communication between people.  In the biblical story of Babel, God gives man many languages, but takes away an easy way to communicate because of these multiple languages.  The rifle can give and take as well.  It can give you the power to communicate force and it can communicate confusion when used to kill innocents; effective communication and ineffective communcation are present.<br /><br />Babel, a rifle, and the power of effective communication.  If you babble few will comprehend, if you shoot at random objects you may communicate hate, and effective communication ends confusion to bring resolution to problems.  Be clear, use tools correctly, and you will come away with fewer problems between your fellow man.<br /><br />There are quite a few excellent reviews, so I wanted to focus on the symbolism of the rifle.  More can be written of the symbolism, but it should serve as a good starting point.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book is not solely about Zombies. It's about how mankind deals with defeating a deadly (Zombie) enemy, and then with making the adjustment to a Post-Apocalypse environment: learning new skills, forgetting old skills, living with the memory of a lot of death. Each &#34;interview&#34; brings a different tale of how man fares during and after this world-changing series of events.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill Volume Two is an excellent movie.  I enjoy it more than volume one.  The story is much better told as we are able to understand the reasons for Uma Thurman's success in killing Bill.  She has trained with a martial arts master and she is using that training to make her way to Bill.  She kills Bill at the end, and that much is obvious.  However, the reality is that she had long since killed Bill.  In the final scene Thurman's character uses the Five Point Exploding Heart Technique to devastating effect on Bill.  After five steps he dies from a heart that exploded.  The Five Point Exploding Heart Technique is actually a symbol for Thurman crushing Bill's heart at the time that she left him in order to keep her unborn child away from a life of crime.  The viewer learns of the technique earlier in the movie, and it reappears at the end to make the statement that this woman had long ago killed Bill.<br /><br />Tarantino is in effect relating an age old tale of the damage a woman may cause when she exits your life.  Your heart explodes in a sense; an excellent way to tell the tale of man's broken heart.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|We have used this product on a long cross country drive. It worked great and charged fast. I would recommend this product especially for dual product families. We have both Android and iOS.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|it held my interest through out it was well written story first than someones dream to make into a movie was a great idea
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very addictive, use your brains and it's easy enough hope it gets harder when new rooms with more challenges come on line
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|Love the ones with Michael playing opposite Selene.  This one..... not as much, even though it does a good job standing on its own.  Selene's character shows she can handle anything that comes her way, but the writers missed a great opportunity to reunite them at the end when it would have been a great finale.  Let's hope the next Underworld brings Michael back.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|I admit that nothing tops the man with no name trilogy, or High Plains drifter, two mules for sister sara, hang em high  or the outlaw josey wales, but this is still a very good film and clint eastwood westerns will always stand as some of the best movies of all time.  This movie is included in that recommendation.  If you enjoy this one, I would also recommend 'once upon a time in the west'.  It's not a clint eastwood flick but it still is a genius of a film.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I LOVE GAMES LIKE THIS .. READING THE REVIEWS I ALMOST DIDN'T GET BUT TOOK THE CHANCE DOESN'T FREEZE, GRAPHICS ARE BEAUTIFUL, ..WOULD RECOMMEND ...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|While this book caught my attention right away I was surprised by the gratuitous use of the f word and the way he called her baby didn't fit with his cold hard Dominant personality. It was also too short but in retrospect I assume that's why there are three of these books. I have mixed emotions about this read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This last book of the hungry games trilogy was well worth it! It was intense, passionate and just in  hell of a read. Suzanne Collins closed this series with a reflective elegance  that is so rare in today's authors. Please read!!! You will not regret it.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It is not as good as the last two books but in my opinion quote \\"it was a good setup for the next book\\". Looking forward to next one,this on was literally a cliff hanger.
1612130283|4.0|This books was so good! I could not put it down!! My only complaint is, I wish there were more books in the series.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I didn't care for the ending and I found some of the narrative tedious.I think Jacob could have been fleshed out more.
0525425772|5.0|... is clean, interesting and worth the cost. I wish he could write faster but then I'd get even less yardwork done!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Hi I think Temple Run2 is so fun. When you play the game for the first time, it's a thrill for your eyes!!!:)))<br />I play on my gramas kindle fire.
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|What a feel good movie.  The casting was perfect!  Actually I thought Billy Connolly and Pauline Collins stole the show!  The direction was wonderful,.,,kudos to Dustin Hoffman.  The music was wonderful and the rest of the cast also terrific.  I love the credits at the end where they show you who all the people are who performed in the movie and where they were from.  It is a must see
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a very popular book & was highly recommended. However, I found it a big downer due to the personalities of the main & other characters. On the other hand I was SUCKED INTO the story, paid for it, so I read the whole book. It was kind of like watching a train wreck.
B0026RLM8O|4.0|always love WR no matter what they do so this is just another great representation from one of the milestone bands of our time
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I thought this was a very original show. It kept me guessing and laughing throughout the season. I will definitely keep watching!
B008MM9630|5.0|sweet and girlie game<br />kills the time and numbs the mind<br />pets still cost too much<br /><br />planting magic seeds<br />don't forget to play online<br />casting magic spells
B001I45UFC|5.0|I love the Chronicles of Narnica.  I have my whole life.  If you have never read it please give it a try.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Other than what we can find in the scriptures, this is the most interesting account of a journey into life after death.  It's simply an amazing book and I highly recommend it to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenges you to think and problem solve, but not too hard. Son loves it too. He is 11. I think students in class would like too.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book is fairly well crafted but it leaves so many open questions.<br /><br />It seems to condone questionable moral choices.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love playing Angry Birds because of different birds and levels, the game is very addictive, it is fun, and it teaches physics in a fun way!  You do not have to be good in math and/or science to play this game!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a fantastic book. It is a suspenseful read that will bring a tear to your eye and make you even more grateful for each and every soldier in the fight.  God Bless America!
B000FCK65W|4.0|A very good story.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  It is definitely worth the effort and the time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great logic escape the room puzzler. the rooms progressively get more challenging; keeping you &amp; your mind alert yet stays engaging and fun. Great graphics and variety!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I found this game more fun when I stopped playing for myself to win and started playing to help others. Even though I tend to give away most of my unfinished room items to help others, my rooms get done eventually, I even have up to Miami complete and I'm only unlocked to Cairo lol.<br />Only thing that would make this game better is if the developers ask and listened to what we want/need in the game, like better inbox accepting options, ability to delete ppl from teammates list, especially if we've unfriend or blocked them.<br />I have to give only 4 stars due to poor customer service and some bad development ideas. If customer support actually helped to resolve issues (wishing we had Zynga support right now lol), and the development team took our input and applied it to the game, would definitely give 5 stars.... inbox issues should be to accept a few more of each item but less wait time, 12 hours is horrid. I can't ever empty my inbox or we should be able to accept unlimited gifts all day, what's the point of sending something someone won't ever receive, and NEED A DELETE TEAMMATE OPTION ASAP
B006M7JCC2|3.0|It seems that the real message here is repeated over and over and maybe I was looking for a novel, not a documented accounting<br />of the experience....over and over.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I'm not a die hard Star Wars fan, but I do like the movies. This package was on sale for the May 4'th (be with you) event and was a great deal. Packaging looks cool and the Blu-ray's look great!
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|The sound is back. Classic with a modern sound. The only thing I wish it was longer. Now we have a taste of what is to come.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|The price of this complete set was unbelievable! All those movies for such a low price. I totally recommend this to any Star Trek fans out there.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm a seriously light sleeper who has had issues falling asleep my entire life. This app is a lifesaver. The ability to mix different sounds and create custom blends for ambient listening has helped me fall asleep and stay asleep. I tried several other related apps but this one is the best.
B0041KXOVC|1.0|I didn't see that the movie was for a different region than where I live. I know it was my fault but the DVD didn't work. I love this movie from my childhood and want my kids to watch it as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game may not be like computer or x-box version but it is pretty cool I say it is worth 7 bucks
B0020BUWX2|1.0|If I Stay is  a poorly written book that focuses on  secondary story not the story it should. You can skip 20 pages and nothing interesting happens. Very disappointing.
B002ZG9846|4.0|Don't start watching this movie if you are sensitive about watching young ladies cursing and killing like a Roman gladiator. Hit Girl, Kick Ass, Red Mist, Big Daddy. Fun and original characters. Lots of humor interjected into action.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Not every runner can be like Scott Jurek, but every runner can learn lessons from this book.  As an aspiring ultrarunner, his lessons on nutrition, training, and the entire concept of learning how to push through suffering really inspired me to get better.  I'n not a vegan, but I've actually tried some of his recipes and they came out great.<br /><br />This is a book that I didn't want to end.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and have modified my nutrition and training habits since reading it.  So far it seems to be working great.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I've heard of John Grisham plenty of times but my tastes tend to skew towards King and Koontz, more horror less legal terms. After reading this book Mr. Grisham has made me a believer in his brand and I will definitely be expanding my library with more of his works.<br /><br />This book is a great read and I highly recommend reading it over a weekend.  I admit to having trouble putting it down and gladly paying the price during work the following day.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|First--this Kindle version is well-done.  The stories are formatted in an accessible manner.  The layout of the stories and songs is well-done.<br />Second--these are *great* stories.  Everyone has seen the Walt Disney version.  The book is far better.  You get a much richer storyline than the surface characters provide in the Disney version.  Kipling mixed the Mowgli stories with other stories as well.  I was very entertained by this book.<br />Highly recommend this to lovers of good stories--of all ages!
B001992NUQ|5.0|If anyone has a fight club out there then let me in. Don't give me the two rules BS either. Someone told you about it, didn't they?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is very awesome!  I played it no stop with and my dad beat it. We kept the game on the Kindle to continue to play.  Hopefully we will get an update soon so we can play more interactive chapters of the game.
0142403873|5.0|A great book.  I love it that it shows no matter how small you are you can defend yourself..without violence.  Just brains.  My kids love it!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is awesome. I've been playing MTG since '96 and have the PC version. I also have every release for PS3 and this is identical to the 2014 version. It runs great on my Galaxy Note 2 and Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and is more intuitive than the PS3 (tapping and swiping as opposed to d-pad and x). If you're hesitant, don't be. Just get it. Don't look back.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|after reading the zombie survival guide i jumped right ino world war z. fast paced and full of interesting stories. i highly recommend checking this out.
B00006F7S4|5.0|It is an good disc. My favorite disc of Beck, very quite and beautiful.<br />Really a great disc. Beatiful music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|We got this for the Nabi and my 4 and 7 year old love it and play it all the time.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Excellent book I love Harry Hole stories.  He keeps you in the story. Wonderful read!<br />Hope some more of his work will become available soon for kindle.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It's flow free electrified! The graphics are cool. If you like flow free you'll like neon flow. Play and have fun.
0316247545|4.0|The first half of the book is a wonderful setup of staff commentary and interesting facts about the characters, world, and a lot of the feeling of the creators who put so much into the MLP:FIM show.<br />Along with some great little concept sketches, the cover of the book, made to look like the one Twilight is reading at the start of the very first episode, makes it worth owning just for artistic value.<br />My only complaint is that the whole second half of the book is just simple frame shots and a TV Guide style overview of every single episode. nothing special or even really very interesting.<br />The first half makes this book worth it if you can pick it up at a discount.
0345803450|3.0|You can hardly give McEwan less than 3 stars as his writing is superb, but this book was a disappointment; I don't go into details, people rating the book before me explained everything.<br />I am looking forward to his next book.
B003G4W49C|4.0|An excellent read. exciting, interesting, and above all gives some new perspective or ideas in which to allow your own imagination to soar. Unfortunately I was able to catch a few editing errors in spelling.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's really fun but they don't have enough levels and I had to go on YouTube and watch several tutorials-
B000FQIRXQ|5.0|It is no wonder that Mr. Dickens is almost as big today as he was back in the 1800's.  His stories are fabulous...peopled by unforgettable characters.  This is a wonderful video!
B008M0TMXQ|5.0|Shoes are light weight for packing.  They have easy on and off in airport security line.  There's a little tread to keep one from slipping.  Easy to keep clean and won't be damaged by rain, sea water, or other elements.  Can even wear some light weight socks if it gets cold.  Look good enough to wear to a party or church!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I found this game to be fun and addictive! At first I thought it might not be fun since I got it free. But once I playedit I became hooked! Get this game! You wont regret it!!
B002PA1HHI|5.0|Amazing a must see go buy it now if you love insane villains and sacastism. 10/10 amazing go see it buy now
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book. Took me two dats to read it because it was so good and I did not want to put it down.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book has all of the passion that 50 Shades did. Some of the language is a bit vulgar, but considering the plot like it is fitting. I couldn't put it down. This book makes you want to read the next installment which is promised to be out soon. I will definitely continue the series.
B00AWJYJVA|1.0|Could not follow the storyline at all. Need a notebook to keep track of people involved, their aims, it is a totally confusing overkill and after reading his book I still haven't got a clue what it's about. Maybe I'm dumb, but even dumb people have rights
B005IYNQAY|3.0|Good sci-fi read didn't stand against the 1st book but entertaining none the less. If you enjoy science fiction ideas Scott Card will entertain you.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin Timberlake...feel how you feel about him but just about everyone has to say the man is mad talented in the music department. Even with just two albums prior to this, he has left an imprint on the R&B game. Seven years have passed since FutureSex/LoveSounds and it was as if something or someone was missing on the radio. You see him on the big screen with the Social Network or In Time (both good movies IMO) or on SNL and you just ask yourself, \\"When is my man getting back in the studio?\\" Well the wait finally came to an end in 2013 dropping nuggets in Suit and Tie, Pusher Love Girl & Mirrors very early in the year leading up to a very electric performance at the Grammys that just ratcheted up the anticipation for his album. Out comes The 20/20 Experience and it seems as if Justin doesn't miss a step. Not one bit.<br /><br />This album is sort of a throwback in sound with it having more of old school 50s-70s appeal to it, the style which he ties into that with men dressing like men in having that style & class with suits and how he made his tracks with them being at times eight minutes in length. These days that is unheard of but this what real artists back then did in giving their fans time and moneys worth.  Justin tipped his hand to this on FutureSex with a couple tracks being in that mold (LoveStoned and What Goes Around come to mind). He takes even more of a risk doing most of his album in this sense, and from my view, he mostly pulls it off. He takes what once was old and makes it futuristic & chic again, hence the name The 20/20 Experience. It is also clever how with the 20/20 Experience title, he carves songs on one track into two as almost as if you are getting a Side A and B to most of the songs. The song starts off in one direction then he flips the beat and makes the song even funkier and groovier on a few of them with the back half.<br /><br />You know you're in for something different and special as soon as the album kicks off with what could be anorchestra with the violins and strings sounding in and then slipping into an almost doo-wop, singing on the corner tune with Pusher Love Girl. Normally I don't condone glorifying drug use, but it is a great example in the sense of the addicting feel of love and sex that certain ladies can have on you. The combo of great songwriting and feel of the track was a great leadoff. And love the flip half with the funky electric guitar! Suit and Tie follows up. Not much I need to say there only that felt that track from the first listen. Almost a lost art that he looks to make appeal again, getting the message across that it's cool to get dressed up with suits when going out. Makes for feeling more grown up and smooth looking. One of my favorites is about as close to just a straight dance track you will get on here with Don't Hold The Wall, a song that has a kind of a Hindu-Middle East Arabic style at the same time off-kilter beat. Hearing it calls for an almost instantaneous urge to get up and dance. The way it starts out with the harmonic Ooh La La Laaa singing reels me in every time! My other favorites are Spaceship Coupe which is a futuristic voyage of just slower midtempo funk of space-age riding with your lady, That Girl with its horns & trumpets-blowing and finger-snapping teaming up with that funky electric guitar and corner harmonizing telling a story of being in love with a girl from 'the other side of the tracks' not paying attention to what others think, and of course Mirrors. This song is an experience in itself with the song feeling as if it has bottled up The Notebook and put it into an eight minute uptempo ballad, telling a tale of what seems like lost love but knowing that person is your other half as the reflect everything great about you and coming to the realization of it. I especially love the last 3 or so minutes like someone mentioned in a review I read with the bass guitar bringing that 70s funk, being the backbone of the second half of the song!<br/><br />This album is not just CD, but DEFINITELY an experience! A musical journey that takes from various sounds, instruments and approaches and combines them into an hour-plus voyage for your ears. There are other standouts on the album with Strawberry Bubblegum (really love the Carribbean/Calypso sound which drives the back end), Tunnel Vision and Blue Ocean Floor with its soft, mellow and hypnotic rhythm that just puts you at ease as it has ocean animals sprinkled in the background. Dress On was a nice bonus with the Target Exclusive as well. Let The Groove Get In and Body Count were the only songs I felt could've been stronger to hold up the album even more, but make no mistake about it. Justin really may have created his masterpiece of his career on this one. Yes there are still moments on FutureSex and even Justified that I would take and bottle up over certain songs on here. But as a whole album goes, this may just edge out (emphasize may, give me a few more months) his second CD for taking a risk few artists take these days and capitalizing on it in being an artist honing your craft, venturing off in different directions instead of staying safe with what has worked before or just being a packaged product. Hey JT, if you knock 'em out the box after seven years on the next musical trip the way you did this one, can't wait for 2020! (there we go with 20 20 again LOL). In the meantime, we all should be enjoying this treat for years to come...<br /><br />P.S. This should've been on here back in March when first purchased, but hope this still is able to help some people if they are on the fence. (WHY HAVEN'T YOU GOTTEN THIS ALREADY?!)
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I purchased this for my daughter, but they lost interest pretty quick. The characters are really cute. There is a lot of reading involved and they are both too young to follow it. It would be best for kids around the ages of 8 - 10.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Bought this for my Kindle as a way to entertain my Nemo loving toddler.  I may not fully understand how this works, but it seems like the whole point is to pay for different decorations for the reef.  Just stupid and it seems like it is too easy for my kid to accidentally purchase something so I run it through a parental control app.  I do not recommend this to anyone.
B00509898G|4.0|Having read the book I wish I did not see the movie 1st. The movie really lived up to the book in this case and perhaps represented the story better even than the book did. Perhaps my opinion would be different if I read the book 1st, the ending was unfortunately not a surprise.
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|I feel like I am using a Mac.  Games are being released years out date.  Amazon needs to wake up and get some quality games ported over.  None of this pay for play, mircotransaction, garbage that they trying to pawn off on the non-gaming public.<br /><br />After saying that, this game rocks!  It is just late.  Kingdom Rush 2 should have been released at this time.  Throw some cash at the fine people that made FTL.<br /><br />Late Addition:  The Hero characters are a bid to get microtransaction cash out of you.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This relationship continues to get more complicated, but they are continually drawn to one another. This is a truly passionate couple with many barriers to overcome. The plot continues to thicken as their pasts come to light. It is sensual, heartfelt, funny, sad, and stressful. Be ready for an emotional ride.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Ken Follett never disappoints, he is definitely a master and eye of the needle is one of his best thrillers ever.
1451695195|5.0|This book is mind-boggling. The fact that the author was not a religious zealot prior to the experience, is an expert in brain science and wrote the book himself, rather than telling the story to a professional author, all add credibility.
B007WZ55XI|4.0|A very good read for all who have read the The cycling bibles by Joe Friel<br /><br />Makes you think and put practice to words
B00846REIS|5.0|This first installment of the series offered a interesting plot and complicated characters. I loved that they have various sides and were shown clearly. This story is one that you will want to continue. You root for this couple despite all of their issues. You feel sorrow for the hurt they have endured and only want them to find the peace they deserve and hopefully can find it with each other.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well written and acted - this is as good as it gets. It reminds me more of a mini-series than than a TV series.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I'm familiar with Sanderson's work in Mistborn, Warbreaker, his novellas and of course the Wheel of Time finale.  Sanderson is incredibly productive and churns out consistently good, exciting novels.<br /><br />In my estimation, The Way of Kings is Sanderson at the peak of his powers.  His no nonsense writing has matured into a highly readable yet sophisticated in his own way prose, and I feel that his characterizations have become richer and more engaging.<br /><br />There are a few points where WOK flags a bit, but I suppose that's to be expected in such a long volume with multiple POVs.  But I have found the book highly rereadable, particularly certain episodes and chapters (the last sequence of chapters is amazing).  I love authors who can not only write great action sequences but also make the reader really care emotionally about the characters.  There are some awesome emotional payoffs and high points throughout the book, and the complexity of most of the \\"villains\\" is refreshing.<br /><br />Highly highly recommended.  One of my favorite reads of the last couple of years.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game and I'm addicted! It really challenges your mind. You have to really pay attention to everything. If you're like me and have a photographic memory, you'll rock at this game!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This Game Really Keeps Me Entertained. It Ia Amazing And So Much Fun. I Could Play This All The Time. And It Is Fascinating How Fun And Mystery Like This Is.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. I laughed out loud, cried a little, and was sad that it had to end. Highly recommended.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app! I like this so much more then I Heart Radio. I like that I can listen to local and world wide stations. I can listen to police scanners (which is fun). I also love that it is so easy to find and listen to my favorite podcasts. I can listen to radio shows from the past when I ever I want. So easy to use on my Kindle Fire.
B005NDJC3K|4.0|Was the best dad for a while because of this and others like it as a Christmas gift. What next?
006178480X|2.0|I am hoping I can truly follow this book, the quantum physics lessons and wrinkles in time are difficult to follow.  His actions and characters are still in great form.
B003K15IF8|5.0|This is a beautifully written, credible and wise character study, one of the most satisfying novels I have read in a long time.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The 25th anniversary production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera is such an amazing musical on so many levels. Everything about this presentation captures how this classic story should look and feel--epic and grandiose, moving and emotional, majestic and enchanting. It is a perfect blend of orchestra, story, singing, mood and emotion; in short, it is a flawless musical.<br /><br />For one, the performers  are exceptional, and quite flawless, especially given that this was a live performance with the world watching. Sierra Boggess, as Christina Daae, is simply amazing, stealing the show with her beautiful voice and singing. She also has the perfect range of emotion in the scenes with the Phantom. Wendy Ferguson also does a fantastic job as well as Christina's foil. Ramin Karimloo does an exceptional job as the Phantom, giving the appropriate blend of pathos to the tragic figure.<br /><br />Furthermore, the production is visually stunning. There are so many scenes that are handled eloquently with the right amount of power and emotion (the graveyard scene with Christine, the masquerade scene, the opening, the finale). The Phantom of the Opera should be seen but also felt, and this production accomplishes this. You literally feel like you are there in the audience watching this. Any film version of The Phantom really pales in comparison to this. One reviewer said it best: it is the difference between fast food and filet mignon.<br /><br />There is also a Grand Finale with the original cast from 1986 coming out and singing with this cast. Andrew Lloyd Webber also makes an appearance. Very cool!<br /><br />The extras include a behind the scenes feature, looking at the preparation for before the big event, with the cast and crew getting ready for the world to see their performance. This really puts into perspective how much work the crew and cast did to get ready, and how much detail goes into this.<br />The sound and picture quality are also great as well.<br /><br />There are so many good things to say about this production. Highly recommended for any fan of the musical.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I'm thrilled with this app.I always know just how much power I have left AND what I can do with it. For instance, if I have X percent of battery left, that will get me X hours of reading, vs X hours of music, vs X hours of video. Very helpful!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|The game is a stationary third person shooter. So ducking in and out of cover is normal but you also get to use tanks big artillery guns and much much more. The game is very fun the only bug/glitch is on the menu where after every couple of missions is freezes and has a bunch of inactive buttons. You have to exit th  game and shut off your device and turn it back on them go into the app for it to work. But other than that one small bug the game is a fun tips with allot of fun stored inside!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I got this game over a month ago and am still completely hooked on checking upon it multiple times daily. Level 36 now and still going.
B00516G6ME|5.0|By far the best out of all the New World Version Starw Hat Pirates! I love the detail on this figure and the paint mostly is on point. Comes with the signiture Franky shades and extra head for his old look. I have all the Straw Hat Pirates except for Jinbei (as of now he hasn't joined yet), Franky and Chopper is my favorite out of all the straw hats and this figure doesn't dissapoint. Comes in a huge box (almost double the size of the other characters). Now i'am just waiting on the Battle Version to come out soon.
0375851569|5.0|It's a set of classic kid's books and my grandson will love them.  The price was really good - $44 @ Barnes and Noble for same set.

B00013RC8O|4.0|Still to this day with all the car chases that have come in many movies, this one stands out as a classic.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Just when you think it's over!  A good read for sure!  Is a little slow in the middle, but has a good twist in the end.
B00BUT5I84|3.0|Seems like these are the songs that didn't make it to the last record.  One or two good ones.  I was excited about the record because the second one was so different than the first.  I like artists that evolve.  No evolution here.
B007FROH4G|5.0|This book would be of great interest to anyone who knows someone suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. Great insight<br />Of the sufferer.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I play this game at least once a day. It keeps my brain in gear. My work requires a lot of waiting idle time so I stay awake by playing.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|First of all this game is so confusing and I HATE THIS 4 and a Half stars game I rate this game a big fat 0
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this type of game. This one is fun, challenging, and original. Each level brings new puzzles that require thought, memorization, and problem solving. The ads are a necessary addition, and they aren't too much. You'll like this game.<br /><br />Running fine on my Kindle Fire.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|First it's a great game.  It's fun and is good if you need to waste time.  What's bad is that you can accidentally buy more land, which is annoying if it cost 50,000 bits like on mine.  You can also accidentally hit a parasite and lose a shard you were saving up.  Last(you only have to read if playing on a kindle fire, I don't blame Gameloft but I do blame Amazon)I was deleting items from my carousel which doesn't delete things from the device, and got to knowing where the butten was.  I got to mlp gameloft and the little bubble the bitten was in moved higher pushing remove from carousel up and also remove from device, before I new it my finger hit remove from device, it didn't even have anything to make sure you wanted to delete it! I had the whole main six , about a million bits, a lot of the shops, 4 of the things you use shards on and most of Ponyville.  I reinstalled hopeing it was like the annoying games where you mess up and try deleting and reinstalling to delete the progress but doesn't, unfortunately it wasn't.  I recommend this game but be careful about deleting by mistake.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|What a terrific story about life and its surprises.  It opens your eyes about pride, love and forgiveness.<br /><br />Warning: it may make you cry.<br /><br />Other highly recommended great foreign movies are:<br />- The Seven Samurai became The Magnificent Seven<br />- Three Outlaw Samurai<br />- Train Man became The 40 Year Old Virgin<br />- Japanese version of \\"Shall We Dance\\" was remade as an American version.<br />- Ringu<br />- Audition<br />- Departures<br />- La Femme Nikita became The Point of No Return<br />- Leon The Professional<br />- Tokyo Sonata
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|If you like sci- fi, suspense thrillers the this show is for you! I love it! And i am addicted to the series.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|I'm not particularly a fan of these types of games.  In fact, I haven't played this game since the tutorial.  It is a very challenging game, but a very well made one.  Pick it up if you enjoy physics  puzzles.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|I really enjoyed this book even though I thought it was a little &#34;preachy&#34;.  It made me really rethink my views on same sex relationships & same sex marriage in relation to the bible & my conclusion is that God loves us all no matter what choices we make & only he can make the decision of what is right or wrong.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been playing for years and enjoy magic the gathering a lot. Glad I am able to take it with me everywhere with my Kindle.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Started off fun. Made it to level 9 and it won't let me go any futher.  Maybe next time.  The game seem to be fun but if it hadn't froze on me I would be able to say more.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is a piece of work. It is easy to use and tells me what I need to know when I need to know it. One of the best app's I have found.
B00991TCOG|5.0|When I'm tired or feeling low, Lindsey's music picks me up and gets me going. She's pure joy.<br />Play on sister!
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I have read nearly all of Michael Pollan's books and find them to be very factual and useful in my everyday world of food preparation and eating.  He really has it right.
B005DN7W4G|3.0|The premise is captivating. A huge comet is headed toward Earth and will hit in less than a year, which means most, if not all, people will die. It's a extinction-level event; an \\"Ele\\", as some unimaginative government official dubs it. But such a thing is hard to take in. Earth hasn't had one since the dinosaurs. So an MSNBC news reporter named Jenny Lerner carries on with her job, looking as lethargic as ever, as the end of the world grows near.<br /><br />A decision she makes near that end is stupid, but it's the boy who discovered the comet while looking thru a telescope in astronomy class who's the ultimate idiot. His impeding doom is a secondary concern for him. He cares more about the classmate he's fallen in love with. Time wasted on such trivial silliness instead of more hardcore realism; The President addressing the nation are the best parts; cushions the blow with a layer of schmaltz.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I wish there was an online multplayer,  but reguardless,  this is well worth $9.99. The graphics are awesome and the game play is very addictive. Buy it even if you've never played. It is awesome.
0425267695|5.0|BEWARE.  Book one has been available for about a year.  This review is for Book One,  Blood-Song.  The release date is new, and if you search for Ravens Shadow Book 2 you end up here.  You got me this time.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|The title suggests a career-spanning biography, but Hitchcock covers the life of the famous movie director (Alfred) only during the conception and production of Psycho. In that sense, it's a movie about the making of a movie; one that happens to be considered one of the best, or at-least most groundbreaking, in cinema history. America was full of prudes back in 1959, so the famous shower scene, which is quite tame compared to the movie murders of today, shocks the theater audience to screams, as intended. Psycho went on to become Alfred Hitchcock's most successful film. This behind-the-scenes retrospective, which spends too much time away from the on-set action to focus on his troubled marriage, is comparatively pointless.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game goes from easy to challenging.  It's a great time waster and is my new favorite challenge.<br />I highly recommend it for all ages.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Interesting point of view, relaxing read with heart!  The narrator's point of you encourages reflection and appreciation for life and how to get the most out of it.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|As my family and friends know, I usually don't do \\"socially relevant\\" or \\"heartfelt\\" movies, but this one is really very good. I saw it last year on a flight to San Diego and thought it was great. Now I just found it is on BluRay so I had to get it. This will be one of my \\"watch again and again\\" movies, right up there with \\"Oz, the Great and Powerful,\\" \\"Prometheus,\\" and \\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.\\"
B003WUYP56|5.0|A well written, easy to read book which describes the state of physics and the institution of physics. Never thought I would say this. ... I liked it so much I bought a copy for my son too!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I am a Brandon Sanderson fan, so had to read this book. Started out a bit confusing for me, but getting a little further in things start to meld and make sense. Sanderson has a way of making his main characters seem so real - with all of the good and bad characteristics that can exist in everyday people. Love the storyline and the characters and look forward to more!
B001RP1G0U|5.0|This movie worked ok. It was a cute lighthearted movie. I enjoyed the actors, and the story line. I didn't think they would ever get together, but they did.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I really like the game but the only problem I have with it is that I have done the tutorial at least 20 times and it makes me mad when I have to do it
B005HSL626|5.0|I think this is my grandaughters absolute favorite game on Kindle. Have to admit I sneak in a few rounds myself when I get get it away from her.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|It's ironic that my first Austen book was her last.  It was a really good book. For those who haven't read any of her books, it does read differently thant modern books (due to the times), but I really enjoyed it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with Drew Evans! I want him for my own!<br />This book was different in the fact that it was from the male POV. I really made for a good read.<br />The heat between Drew and Kate was off the charts! Their fiestyness makes for some major intensity.<br />Kate was Drew's equal, and  that was something he was completely not prepared for. She made him work for it, instead of  throwing herself at him. It was just an all around great read!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|The whole family enjoys using it especially my 6 yr old grandaughter. Lots of features and drawing tools. Very easy to use..
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book literally had me laughing out loud.  I would recommend it to anybody.  The male point of view I have to say was far more entertaining.  I would love to read something else from this author.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I enjoy watching the \\"original\\" three movies once a year or so.  I'm not a purist, so I don't care that scenes may have been altered or added.  The audio and video quality are excellent.  Well worth the money I paid.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun but aggravating. If you like a challange the upper levels will keep you going. Love the little smirky grins when they beat you.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is a really awesome game. The graphics are really good on the nexus 7. I am happy that this game was only .99 cents.
B001AUKUS6|5.0|Not as great as when they first came Out of Cellar but does continue to Rock your brains out with such flair!
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|Equally as awesome. I really enjoyed it. For a remake of such an epic film they did. Beautiful job. Super scary. Watched it a fark apartment with a bottle of wine. Love it.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I really don't play this game very much. When i do play it, it works as well as expected. It's okay.
B000002IQW|3.0|All around a pretty good effort that does lack a hidden kick in ass but does try to slap your ears like when a Baby first wakes from a deep sleep only cause his or her belly is empty!
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is so much fun! Very entertaining. However, Android updates its versions ALOT faster then Amazon.  I've had issues with this in the past.  Version 7.2 is out on android. :(
B002WY65W4|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this is good comedy movie. There are several scenes that I think are great. It's just I expected a lot more from it given the cast and theme. I feel like they could have done more… made a movie even funnier with ease.<br /><br />So in the end I liked it, but was let down.
B000002IJO|5.0|Crosby lets the cool of this band fly high & mighty as it should! Solid drumming with just right thundering bass plus very entertaining dual guitars!!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Strayed is a great storyteller & I felt as though I was on the trail with her; her anxiety was my anxiety. Her mourning was my mourning. Her success, mine. The ending is so perfect and beautiful and poetic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Want more levels!!!!! great game that is just difficult enough but not frustrating. Could play all day. Wish they had additional goals or prizes though.
B000001FO4|5.0|Tom delivers with great patience such a remarkable slice of good old Hard Rock & Roll like it should be.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have never been good at staying organized but using this as a foundation on my Kindle is doing wonders for me.  Inuse this in conjunction  with COZI and so far it meets all my needs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was so fun and challenging. I got through all the levels quickly. I would seriously get this game!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Loved it. Really enjoyed the ongoing interchanging story lines. Can't wait fir book four. I hope he continues to write more!
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Decided to watch it again the other day and remembered why I've loved this movie ever since childhood. Matilda is a great movie and entertaining for all ages. It will definitely be a part of my kid's video library!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I had been waiting for this game to be available for kindle!  Totally awesome game!  Looking forward to playing it!
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Downloaded talking tom for my grandson.....Problem was that while we watched Tom's mouth move we didn't hear a thing! The cat literally had Tom's tongue!!!!!!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Blake continues to amaze with great lyrics that hit home with a great beats that keeps your toe tapping.  Classic Shelton, another album that contains your next favorite song.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|Long battery life. No problem hearing music underwater. No earbuds necessary. Highly recommended for lap swimmers. I haven't figured out how to adjust the volume (if it is possible) but it is adequately audible.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Good game I've had it on my kindle fire for about a month now and I love it and Highly recommend this product
0679805273|5.0|Got this book for my grandchildren.  At the end of each school year the teacher that year will sign and write a comment.  You then present it to the grandchild when he or she graduates from high school  The story fits it perfectly
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Organized my equipment in a better manner than the carry bag with over-the-shoulder strap I used for many years.  The prior bag was good at the time, this is a huge improvement.<br /><br />The compartment holders are adjustable, a must-have feature.  The inside pockets are mesh for see-thru ease and have sturdy zippers, as does the whole pack.  The smaller outside pockets are handy.  I didn't try the tripod holder, though it looks like it would function well.<br /><br />Other reviews/posts questioned the ability to carry a laptop.  My 13&#34; MacBook Pro with a Speck hardcover fit snuggly into the pack.  My suggestion is to zip in the laptop first, then zip the camera equipment compartment.  This seemed to make for an easier and stress-free closing of the zippers.  The pack isn't padded where I put the laptop, therefore I suggest the hardcover or some other suitable protection for the device.  A 15&#34; laptop would probably be too large to fit in this bag.<br /><br />I used this on a vacation cruise.  It was easy to carry all my equipment, the backpack design is very comfortable.  Having both camera and laptop with battery chargers and a Belkin BZ103050vTVL mini surge protector (a great item as well) in one compact bag was so convenient and efficient!<br /><br />The lack of &#34;steal-me&#34; tags, as others have noted, is also a huge plus.  It looks like every other generic backpack, another feature important to me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I own a Kindle Fire HD 8.9, the game would freeze after the video when its loading . But after a while once you keep going on the game it works . Now back to the game review .... It runs very smooth and It has very nice flaws to it . In the store you can by little gadgets to help you in the game and upgrade them, but the best parts is the little characters you can buy so far i think there is like 8 and there very cute and cool . You can also challenge your friends from Facebook and send them taunts which is really . But like I said &quot;ITS THE BEST MOBILE RUNNING GAME OUT THERE .&quot; I recommend this to EVERYONE !
0596007124|5.0|It is excellent and very clear book (much easier to understand comparing to the \\"gang of 4\\" book).<br />I'm a c++ programmer and the book was perfect for me even though it uses Java (which i don't know). Code is clear even for c++ programmers.<br /><br />I wish Head First will write books for c++ programmers as well...
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Does what the advertisement states.  This is compact to carry, easy to use, great for work situations where a quick sharpening is needed.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book. I'm actually moving to another school so I can relate. I would recommend this book to my friends  in a heartbeat.
B000002H2H|5.0|I love this cd and lots of other Metallica CD's very much. When I listen to the lyrics, I see every day life expressed in an unique way.<br />Learning to know that there is a lot more to live for than to die for.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Some of these works show Joes new direction, nothing wrong with his old one, but I love the new stuff as well as his earlier recordings.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great to have at my fingertips.  It has made it easier for me to stick with a daily reading plan.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|IF you are a deep thinking, problem solving, math whiz with religious ties to Hebrew Scripture, then you might find this B&W movie has intrinsic value, but if you love technicolor, normal drama, high adventure, or comedy then this is not for you.  However, this movie did win some awards . First, the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay, and the Gotham Open Palm Award. Also, one at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.<br />Some reviews call this a psychological thriller, but I think that is being kind.
B000002GVO|5.0|Their best work ever! No wonder they broke up later, not much you can do to improve on this magical songcycle.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I've played Magic online since the 2012 version and the main part of the game is the online play. Android is the only version that doesn't allow this, only through Bluetooth with friends. But then you might well just bring cards. All other versions of the game allow actual online play. If an update gives this ability to play then the game would be a good 4 stars. It does freeze up sometimes.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect but I found it hard to put down.  I am glad I read it before seeing the movie, which I will see in 2 days.
B00417HV14|5.0|Its a rare day for me to buy a blue ray, but if this one gets scratched, I will order another that Day! At 64, not very much new music gets to me, but this work is wonderful. You could tell the crowd was really into it and with him on every tune. The boys in the Band were spot on. You can not say too much about this, buy it now you will NEVER regret it,I promise! {{ps. video and sound on this blue ray are heavenly}}  Victor
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love kindle. Ihave it on all four of my devises and can read my book wherever I am, it syncs to where Themistocles recent page is on the farthest devise.
030799077X|5.0|Beautifully written.  Arrived just fine but was not aware that it was a large print edition.  No problem.  I think that made it much nicer to read.
0060254920|5.0|I read this book to my children when they were young and now have bought it for my 9th grandson. Excellent book!
0345525558|5.0|Exceptional book written by an author well aware of the difficult nature of foster children's circumstances.  I will never look at flwers the same again.  Instead, I will credit them for the extra message they deliver.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I was expecting something stupid, maybe gross, and not really of much substance.  I was pleasantly surprised with a sweet, fun, mommy movie, full of laughs, and tear-jerker moments too.<br /><br />If your not looking for anything too in-depth, but something both guys and girls could enjoy together, this movie is great.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I have lived off and on for 11 years in Japan. Clavell's novel Shogun totally captures and illuminates the differences between the way non-Japanese and Japanese think in a thoroughly enjoyable book with a marvelous story. His characters are real, fully developed, true to their culture of the time of the story and woven into the story in a masterful manner. This is an exciting book, the story grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the end. Of all of Clavell's novels this is the best! If you have never read any of his books this is the one to read! This ranks as one of my favorite historical novels.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show is just one of the very best on TV.  Book fans might be angry at certain plot changes and departures from the book but in my opinion enjoy the show on it's own. The books are amazing but they go out the window with the show.  The show does follow them as closely as they can but I feel that the changes they make for the TV show work.  If you love fantasy films/series then this is a must-watch for you.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love Khaled Hosseini.  Life in Afganistan (for women) must be hideous.  The twists in this book though show that family while a better life is indeed very important, but the one remaining truth is that &#34;family comes first&#34;.  There is no bigger bond than family.  Can't wait to see another book by Khaled Hosseini - soon.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was so disappointed in the previous Bond film because Casino Royale was such an exciting reboot of Bond that I was let down.  However Syfall takes Bond to new heights.  The movie was intense, fun, full of action and good acting.  The big bad in the film works because he's slightly insane and he Bardem makes him believable.  If you love Bond you'll love this film.  If you're not a Bond fan but do love action/espionage films you will love this film anyway.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|I listen to a lot of music as I write. The Lord of the Rings soundtracks have been my favorites so far, and this album is ranking right in there with them!<br />I love the dwarves songs, and the instrumentals are great for several different moods of writing. I have been listening to it constantly lately, finding that it is fitting in perfect for whatever I am writing at the moment.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|however the film isn't anything I'd want to see again.  While it looked pretty and the effects were really good the movie wasn't memorable.  It just wasn't the type of film that I'd want to see over and over and that's a shame.
B0002DB52M|5.0|But it eventually turns into a very powerful movie.  Has a lot of zesty scenes and dialogue and a surprise ending…Says something about the human tendency to abuse a good thing eventually...
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|as long as you don't take this movie seriously you'll enjoy it.  It seems to me that Arnold is just having a ton of tongue n' cheek fun with the entire thing and so that makes the movie fun overall.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|although I do not like giving a bad review, since I know the Author's went through a lot of work to write this book, and it was a free read.  However, I find that this was a difficult read. There were many grammar and spelling mistakes as well as the words did not seem to flow correctly. I was always trying to figure out who was saying what, and what the meaning was of the sentence. And what I could figure out, I did enjoy the story. Now, this is just my opinion as someone else might not find the difficulty that I did and with that said I do recommend this book.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|compared to the original this one has great production values but it wasn't fun.  I mean the original at times goes to the ridiculous but it's memorable, this movie can just be any other sci-fi film, nothing that you'd really want to view on repeat viewings.  The acting was fine but it all felt depressing and dreary.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I love the book when I first look at it I thought it was going to be boring but as I was going through its debts of meaning it had gotten an emotional meaning in my heart
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Obviously what makes this movie compelling at the performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper along with it's strong supporting cast.  It's a drama through and through so if you don't like that sort of film that it's all about &#34;Talk&#34; and no action then you might not have the patience for this.  However if you don't mind those films then you will enjoy this movie, it's really good.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The Life Of Pi was a very interesting book. I believe there are life lessons to be learned from the story. The lessons are hidden in the story. The words painted pictures. I watched the movie after reading the book. My imagination proved true. However, I must say the end of the story was a surprise for me!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is amazing game .I love horse so does my best friend .. When I saw it I told her an she was like u got to get this and I did  an IT awesome love love it.
B007SGM084|4.0|I learned several things from this series. My emotions went from disgust to disbelief to relief. I found it difficult to put the book down.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|They say most films never do the books they were adapted from justice.  That saying is definitely true for World War Z.  The book is a pure masterpiece of horror.  it takes the genre to a whole new level.  If you read one zombie book this year, World War Z needs to be that book.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Excellent album....anyone who likes the blues will enjoy this masterpiece.  I highly recommend this or any music from this band.

B00006AW2J|5.0|Great classic Stones album.  Had it for many years on vinyl, wanted a copy on cd.  Glad I ordered it.  The Rolling Stones rule!
B00009YXHN|4.0|Dr. Herbert West (Jeffrey Coombs) is at it again! Having not learned anything from his experiences in 1985's \\"Re-Animator,\\" the mad scientist continues to simultaneously play both doctor and God. Culling spare body parts from the local university, West promises to his loyal buddy Dan (Bruce Abbott) to restore the love of his life, Megan (who you may remember as being played by Barbara Crampton in the original). It seems Meg's heart continues to beat, and while Dan is distracted by a new love (Fabiana Udenio) and a dying patient (Kathleen Kinmont), Dr. West is determined to re-unite the two lovers by any means necessary because, well, what else are friends for?<br /><br />Taking the reigns from director Stuart Gordon, Brian Yuzna (\\"Return Of The Living Dead III\\") has his work cut out for him. Following up a certified cult-classic such as \\"Re-Animator\\" is no easy task, and yet Yuzna's follow-up, \\"Bride Of Re-Animator,\\" works hard to maintain the same level of zany good times as delivered by its predecessor. Retaining the pitch-black humor of the original almost to a fault, Yuzna's film is steeped in tragedy, revenge and outright insanity. Coombs is in top form as Dr. Herbert West, while Abbott is admittedly given little to do beyond tearing himself between his various loves. No matter, because the film is endlessly entertaining and utterly twisted. The special effects are quite the spectacle unto themselves, boiling over into a wacky and truly delicious final act.<br /><br />If there's one gripe to be had with \\"Bride\\" it's that the film lacks a cohesive pace. More often than not, story is forsaken for the sake of various undead antics and shenanigans (see the wife-beating detective hot on Dr. West and Dan's trail for reference). Sometimes the film tries a little too hard perhaps, but that's part of its charm. It's all or nothing with Yuzna, and his hyped-up take on H.P. Lovecraft's mythology does not disappoint. Those seeking a gloriously gory and at times touching horror story would do well to find themselves hitched to \\"Bride Of Re-Animator.\\"rror story would do well to find themselves hitched to \\"Bride Of Re-Animator.\\"

B005IZLPKQ|1.0|Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Rated &#34;PG-13&#34;. Running Time: 2 hours, 04 mins.<br />Directed by Joe Johnston.<br />This movie begins after [[ASIN:B005H9B44A Thor]] (2011).<br /><br />  A strange aircraft is found in the Artic. Two men from Washington DC have arrived to take a look at it. It is deep in ice and snow. They cut an opening and inside the craft, they find a metal American shield.<br />  The story goes back to 1942 when Nazi officer Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving)  invade Norway to steal the Tesseract which is said to have a mysterious blue-light energy source.

B002VWNIAY|5.0|A classic love story with a real ending, not a fairy tale ending.  The guy doesn't always get the girl he really loves.<br />Would recommend to everyone.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I decided I wanted to have easy-access (and a permanent home) for MagLites on every floor, and in the garage. I was apprehensive about the low price, but took a chance because I trust the brand. What a good call that was.<br /><br />Installation is a snap. Put in two screws, and you're done. I'd strongly recommend putting the screws in to studs, instead of using anchors or [[ASIN:B003VNCCZE Wall Dogs]], because these clips hold your MagLite TIGHT! And the clips are really high quality, so they haven't snapped or weakened.<br /><br />If you're really trying to stretch your dollar, you could probably use one clip per flashlight, because they're that strong and hold that well. I did two each, just for the extra security. Either way, I tested one clip with my loaded 6-cell, and it didn't flex or anything.
B0009UC810|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  A laugh a minute.  How could 2 guys get themselves into so much trouble and still survive to fight another day because they are on a mission for God.  This is truly a cult movie.  Would recommend it to everyone.

1592332803|5.0|As you know, vegan baking can be tricky, especially to the person new to the lifestyle. Lots of good information here; I learned a lot just reading about how different vegan items produce the effects we want in our baking. Excellent recipes. Yum! Highly recommended.
B00CW665VI|2.0|So this is the story of the handsome, rich, successful, can-have-any-woman-he-wants playboy and how he meets that one special girl who makes him want to finally change his ways.  You know, your typical girl's wish fulfillment fantasy type story.  And it's done with a lot of humor and is pretty entertaining and I can see why it's so popular but I really wish someone had warned me about how freakin CHEESY it'd be.  Like eye-rolling, gag-inducing, so-corny-I-never-want-to-eat-corn-again-corny.  There are glimpses of it in the beginning half of the book as Drew is recounting his tale, but once he gets to the present timeline, the story reaches an extreme level. **slight spoiler** the stuff that he does to try to win her back is sooo cheesy and are the kind of grand romantic gestures a 16 year old girl probably fantasizes about but honestly, actually having a grown man doing all those things was just really, really lame.  And it takes up way too many pages and not only was it hard to read cuz it was so nauseatingly cheesy, but it was boring too.<br /><br />I see the other low star reviews talking about misogyny and how Drew is a spoiled pig and yeah, there is all that, but it didn't really bother me. I mean, you can pretty much see what you're gonna get from the first few pages of the book, so whatever. And like I said, it's pretty funny. And Drew's voice, in all its unapologetic a-holey glory, is actually quite inexplicably charming.  But with no cool plot twist or anything unexpected happening along the way, this book ended up just being one huge predictable  cliché-fest. And um, did I mention it was cheesy?
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Awesome game! Pretty easy at first but definitely gets more challenging and addictive as you go along! This is a must have game for those who like matching games similar to bejeweled...but with a story behind it.
0736644296|5.0|This is a timeless novel written by one of our most celebrated novelist of the 20th century. I love reading it over and over again.

B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Queensryche - Self Titled<br />Written by The Rock Man<br /><br />Over the course of the past several years, opinions between some sections of the media, music journalists and fans have been divided over the quality of work produced by progressive metal icons Queensryche. Their past two studio recordings American Soldier (2009) and Dedicated To Chaos (2011) have taken quite a beating by some. I for one a fan of both. Given the recent turmoil in the band causing the departure of vocalist Geoff Tate and his own release of a Queensryche album, Frequency Unknown, the world has waited patiently for \\"The Original Queensryche\\" to respond with a release of its own. Well rock fans here it is.<br /><br />The three remaining original members, Michael Wilton - lead guitar, Eddie Jackson - bass and Scott Rockenfield - drums have joined with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre and Sledgeback guitarist Parker Lundgren to record a new album simply titled Queensryche. And what an album it is. In its time the band have acquired a massive armoury of quality material and Queensryche can stand proudly along side all of them.<br /><br />A strong feature of any Queensryche album is the bass playing from Eddie Jackson and on this latest recording that feature continues. Scott Rockenfield continues to push the boundaries of his playing with a bold, innovative style and on this record sounds refreshed and full of enthusiasm. Michael Wilton, as always, displays his ability as a master axe man with amazing melodies and technique and on Queensryche raises the bar of his own standards.<br /><br />Vocally Todd La Torre puts in an outstanding performance on his first Queensryche outing, sounding very much like the man he replaced, Geoff Tate and at times Nils K. Rue from Pagan's Mind. I know these thoughts will upset all the Geoff Tate haters who are circling for his blood, but that's how I heard it, and that is a good thing, they still sound like the Queensryche I grew up listening to and not some sad, pale imitation.<br /><br />The album opens with X2 an Operation Mindcrime style intro before launching into Where Dreams Go To Die. From there the album forges ahead with Spore and In This Light which took me back to the early to mid 1990s. Redemption is classic Queensryche, enough said. Vindication could have easily been a throw away from the Rage For Order album, while towards the back end of the record you have power tracks Don't Look Back and Fallout. The album draws to a close with Open Road, a big time ballad.<br /><br />All round Queensryche is a very enjoyable listen and enhances the band's legacy. Debate will continue to rage over whether this offering is better that the Geoff Tate recording, you may have your own view, for mine I think they are equal and both do the Queensryche brand justice.<br /><br />SCOTT ROCKENFIELD INTERVIEW ONLINE NOW AT FULL THROTTLE ROCK!me sad, pale imitation.<br /><br />The album opens with X2 an Operation Mindcrime style intro before launching into Where Dreams Go To Die.

0545123291|5.0|My 13-year-old bibliophile loved this book enough to pay her own money for it.  She is very happy with the purchase.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Can't wait to start the third.  Great book. Very nervous about what happens next. Don't see how it can be a movie.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|good game had fun trying to figure it out but they should give you hints every now and again. cause I got stuck for 3hrs
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book made me learn alot of things  good things and a bit of bad things. I would recommend this book who people that are adventurous and with a bit of romance. This experience was the best  i loved this book especially the last chapter.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am still early in the game but I am enjoying it so far!! I like the bit of challenge and it helps pass some time away!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|My only complaint is that I beat it!  I want more, even though I played it for hours and hours.  Basically mixes RPG and quick twitch puzzles into a perfect blend.  You upgrade your &quot;gear&quot; which translates into interesting dynamics.  You can also gain items to use along the way.  There are mini challenges in the games that can pay off in big rewards.  My only suggestion is don't become discouraged if at first it seems too hard, because that's part of the charm, you'll gain bonuses to make it easier.
B000AQJPQE|5.0|Great looking product. Will be looking forward to seeing it hung up in my grandson's room in a few more weeks.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a good time killer, but the controls are somewhat unresponsive on my Samsung galaxy note 2.  Since it's free to download, you should give it a try, none the less.  Nothing to lose and possibly a great game to gain.  nHas in game purchases, but so far haven't used them.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I've played alot of these kinds of games but this is by far the best of the best!  The developers continually improve upon the game, adding new elements that keep it interesting.  No other game out there compares to Ice Age.  It's in a category all its own!!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This item is exactly what I wanted. The style and functionality allow me to enjoy my kindle in every situation.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved it!! Can't wait for the next one!!!!! I hope it's not too long before the next one comes out.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|As the title ,It works calc and than some easy access ,easy navigation and display what you doind below the big display as well for easy back track.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I couldn't wait to know what was going to happen next. A perfect ending to this trilogy.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is sits on the pantheon of those few and rare truley original and enteraining works.  Just when you think you have worked out the plot and the hidden character agenda....you don't.  You are brain dead if you don't watch these series.
B005MMYEF8|5.0|This series is awesome!<br />Ancient history in a raw, no holding back! Be aware, not for the squeamish or the faint of heart!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i just downloaded this because it was free and i am having an amazing time playing it. i like how you have to collect objects and use them to unlock safes, doors etc.
B0094KT6J8|5.0|I respect the philosophy of Walt Disney, and \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" continues in his tradition. It has messages all through it, to have a dream, never to give up, racial tolerance, kindness, forgiveness, on and on. I also appreciate that it advocates the Christian aspect of values such as marriage, family, prayer, love, etc. without alienating non-Christians. I love the contemporary cartooning style, which gives such lifelike and amusing expressions to the characters--much more recognizable as those seen in friends and acquaintances. I loved this production so much I bought it after seeing it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So glad I finally read the books! Now I can watch the movie and wait patiently for the next to come out!
B00992CF6W|4.0|i love this app don't get me wrong but it won' t open anymore :( people who don't know how to get survival put down your keyboard it' ll be there
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I had read a Sherlock Holmes story years ago, but also knew there was more to the stories than what the &#34;MOVIE&#34; had used, so I picked it up and i'm enjoying the read.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|It was not as exciting and action filled as I had expected.  It is typical Disney and good for kids.  Not much for adults.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Wonderful story previously unheard of coming out of rapidly diminishing eyewitness accounts from WWII. Couldn't put it down. Recommended it to teen grandson who is presently reading it as well.
B008B68IUY|5.0|This Monster High Scaris Convertible is a big hit with both girls and boys, My sons might actually like it more. This car has some neat features like seatbelts and a trunk that opens, the gear shift also moves, not that I think a kid is going to move a doll's hand on it to \\"drive\\". The styling of this car is really neat, there are cutouts all around to make a nice pattern, and the color is pretty. The seatbelts can be a pain since they don't open/close they just kind of stick into a slot. This car rolls easily and seems like it is fairly sturdy.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Weighs less & is very compact. Minimal design. Just love the ease of use! Would have been nicer if the compartments were a little more sturdy.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Great product for anyone who likes to share pictures and albums, on the go, or anywhere you have an internet connection
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have had this mouse for about a month now and it has worked phenomenally.  I use it quite often and have never ran into any problems with it.  Being able to customize the mouse with all of it's features makes it truly personalized to meet the users expectations.  Interestingly enough, being able to customize the weight makes the mouse much more comfortable and compatible with the user as well. For the gamers out there who are looking for an amazing mouse at an inexpensive price, I would recommend this mouse 100%.
B000UGZTQO|4.0|These things will last forever, secure and strong. Still the thumb knob just seems too big and bulky a minor trade off though.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|God bless the old boys of Black Sabbath anyone who rates this below 4 stars is just not a true Black Sabbath fan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game great graphics everything is great you get to do compatisions so in my opinion get it I don't know what other people think about it but this is mine
B004XGN8W4|5.0|if you like going to cons and travle alot this is the best case for you its durrable and the included screen looks beautifull especially when playing battle field 3  the sound is great the only cons are the viewing angles arent greate and get washed out but otherwise great for anyone
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is such a great 1. I recommend it to people who want to create many amazing things and definetly I will not recommend it to peeps who are the hats this for the money! they r the losers because they are just hasty with money. I personally think they should be ashamed with them self's. it is getting in their way to not get any fun with this app!! now that's enough talk about the hating peeople they should be ashamed! anyway this app is great u can explore all sorts of worlds dig for gold diamond and iron. its so amazing I really hope u get it.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|very strong story line and constant evocation of character and plot.<br />The long standing relationship with Rachel and Oleg and the deepening of that love and yet the impossibility of consummation and completion is as much a driver as the breathtaking and taut action sequences.  Nesbo makes it impossible to seriously consider most other noir writers as he is clearly in a league alone.<br /><br />One feels a fullness and Poe&#34;esque&#34; completion if Poe provided complex and thrilling action too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It keeps me entertained for hours! I cant wait for new rooms and new challenges!
1557420580|5.0|This book came in great condition, and the text is at a good size for casual reading. I just finished the first chapter, and the content is interesting as well.
B003Y24HFU|4.0|Great collectible, too bad the sound quality is better in the original vynil, but all fans must have it... worth the price
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is seriously great it tests the mind and its a great thinking .game I highly recommend it too
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|The game was confusing at first but it was interesting and fun after you understand how to play it also doesn't freeze up my tablet.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like how there multiple clues and items to fit together. The only downside is that I wish there were more levels!
B003YVCJQ0|1.0|Buyer beware!  If you're looking at this thinking that you'll be able to play the HD version on your Tivo, prepare to be disappointed.  That is *not* going to happen.  Despite Amazon saying that it's available for the Tivo, it isn't.  If you order it, you won't be able to download it to your Tivo.  You'll have to watch it on your Kindle Fire or similar device.<br /><br />Amazon should a) change the description of this item immediately) b) be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for their false advertising.
B008602KQI|3.0|The conflation of the ancient Roman life-style and the all-pervasive media culture of the present is original, since it offers the commentary that today's obsession with the real (no matter how vacuous the representation of that &#34;real&#34; might be) and the media's pandering of &#34;reality shows&#34; correspond to the gladiator battles of the past, where one's struggle for survival was another's entertainment. The film's uneven distribution of wealth and resources between the urban city and the rural country also points towards this inherent problem of class struggle as much as it does to a politics of race (somehow touched upon by Cato letting the protagonist go, instead of killing her).<br />But what about the internal contradictions of the city and the rural? Do all the wealthy live in urban settings, while the people in the country are uniformly poor, broken, and left to their own resources? Is it that simple and compartmentalized? If this is the case, how can the system ensure the &#34;loyalty&#34; of the peripheral districts to its hegemonic rule, especially in the age of effective communication technologies, where the subjects are able to witness the blessings enjoyed by the urban population and starve in their decrepit homes?<br />The film loses whatever originality it introduces as the plot makes its way into the forest background, where &#34;the survival of the fittest&#34; theme is played out. The main problem is that the protagonist does not experience any authentic conflict - her choices to &#34;take care of&#34; some and &#34;take down&#34; others are already inscribed in the opening sacrificial act she performs in saving her sister in the early part of the film. So, isn't there any learning, wisdom, or growing-up involved all through these radically different experiences and displacements? Why does she only contemplate the possibility of forming an alliance with her &#34;fellow villager,&#34; rather than exploring other, potentially more dynamicand politically emancipatory ones?<br />As a result of these problems, the protagonist, unfortunately, remains a flat character. One moment that contradicts with this is the scene where she is interviewed by the host in front of a massive number of audience. While she arrives naive and ignorant of the urban population's tastes, mannerisms, and demands, she immediately picks up the pattern in which the audience responds to her answers and begins to manipulate them to her advantage. This is probably the strongest scene in the development of character and reflects some interesting potential for her to understand, dissect, and use the loopholes of the system to her advantage. But, instead of extrapolating these potentially emancipatory departure points, the latter part of the film wallows in a series of sappy, soap-opera kind of romantic and sacrificial cliches and loses whatever originality it promises in the beginning.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|Apparently in the future we no longer have to eat, drink, defecate or urinate.  All you will need is a \\"smart suit\\" to keep you going, unless of course the temperature drops below zero.  But, why quibble with such details, M. Night Shyamalan and Will Smith seemed to turn this entire project over to young Jaden.  It's a coming out party essentially, a whimsical blend of the sci-fi films Jaden apparently likes, plus a nod to Moby-Dick, which it seems he had to read in school.<br /><br />The story could have just as easily been set in Alaska or the High Sierra with father and son on a camping trip, menaced by an over-sized grizzly bear.  Father and son could have communicated with walkie-talkies or mobile phones as the son had to seek help on his own due to his father being too weak to move. Instead, we get a kind of post-apocalyptic earth that appears to be a throwback to an earlier Cenozoic era with over-sized condors, saber-toothed lions and simian troops.<br /><br />There is kind of a nice moral to the movie about conquering fear.  I suppose a big white whale seemed like a good analogy to the over-sized insect known as Ursa in this film, although that wasn't what Moby-Dick was about.  You knew what was coming long before it happened.  There was surprising no tension in this film.  The only thing mildly disconcerting were the flashbacks.  There certainly isn't any far-reaching philosophical narrative as there was in Moby-Dick, just your standard survival tale set on Earth some 1000 years into the future long after human kind ceased to be part of the picture.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|&#34;Les Miserables&#34; is magnificent.  I can watch it only every so often because the movie makes it so very REAL. But it encompasses all life, from the Divine to the wretched in the gutters.  From great voices to great sadness.  From great loss to great redemption.  Please don't miss this film.  It was beautifully cast.  I've got to put a personal comment in here, though:  Hugh Jackman's performance of Valjean was absolutely worthy of a Best Actor Oscar. He made Jean Valjean LIVE; and he made us care throughout his life.  BRAVISSIMO, Hugh! and your cast, whom I do not slight at all.  Beautiful work to you all.  Betty Willard.

B001BWYZWA|4.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of Rudy is an improvement over the DVD, with sharper detail throughout.  The colors are not particularly bold, but they are adequate.  It actually works for this movie, which is set in the 1970s; it gives it an aged look.  The dialogue was a bit soft--I had to crank up the volume.  But the tackles and other football related sounds have good oomph to them.  All in all, I was pleased.  If you are considering an upgrade to Blu-ray, I think it is worth it.
1616550414|5.0|We all know what's inside, is true that a large amount of the book is about skyward sword, but the book makes it up to you by giving you a big chapter on the history of hyrule too, apart from the fact that has a lot of sketches (it even have the first sketches and notes for the original legend of zelda) and a lot of artwork. I think it's totally worth it if you really love this franchise.
030726839X|5.0|Excellent story. Best I've read from the Churchill viewpoint. Should be mandatory reading for WW2. What more can be said in five words.
1442346949|2.0|Considering how much hype this book had gotten at the time, I'm surprised at how poor the Audiobook read is. The combination of mispronouncing well-known industry jargon, irregular and unnatural pauses, and failing to emphasize correctly, made listening to this very difficult.<br /><br />Mr. Isaacson, thank you very much for your work. I really did enjoy it, despite the terrible narration.
B0051CSI0G|5.0|I have no idea who any of these actors are except for the women I barely recognizied who was in Top Gun and Witness years ago, she's still a great actress but has aged terribly which made her fit in this movie perfectly.<br /> The atmosphere in this film truly felt like a depressing apocalyptic world and the story was unbelievably just as depressing and at times heart breaking due to these great actors whoever the hell they are.<br /> I must have watched this movie about 4 times in a row after receiving it in the mail from Amazon. I'd never even heard of it. Finally a great vampire movie made for an audience that's not made up of a bunch of whining ,crying, ugly, pathetic, lonely teenage girls.<br /> Hate to say it but I think I like this vampire movie even more than the Underworld vamp films, It has a very realistic feel about it, and the vampires are disgusting looking ,you wouldn't want to become one ,not in this movie.<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!!!!
B001VS46DC|5.0|Great DVD, good mixture of Brazillian scenes mixed in with the performance.  Allowance of audiance involvement also added to the DVD.
B00DHRLK84|1.0|I went to see this film the first day it came out, I also saw it in 3D.<br /> I'd seen the previews of it on TV and already had a bad feeling that it was going to suck, and it did.<br /> All the best scenes if you can call them best are in the previews for the movie.<br /> There was little if any blood shown at all and I'm not a gore freak.<br />There were NO ZOMBIES in this film, a zombie is a dead decomposing, rotting human. The so called zombies in this movie were \\"I Am Legend\\" CGI Infected people who ran faster than cheetahs.<br />This movie has the wrong title, it should have been World War B (for bad).<br /> The very worst episode of the Walking Dead was 10 times better, had more story and suspense than this entire movie had in it, thank Odin I never read the book this piece of trash was based upon, from what I've heard the book was great. I would have been very disappointed if I was expecting it to be that good.<br /> This had to be the most predictable story I ever saw.<br /> Spoiler alert, Brad Pitt saves the world, what a surprise.<br /> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY TO MAKE AND PAY TO WATCH.<br /> Wait for it to be shown in prime time on TV uncut because it should have been rated PG instead of PG13.<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!!!!

B000055Y0Y|5.0|This is a great film.. This movie came on ion today and as soon as I saw Client Eastwood, I knew I had to check this movie out to see what it was all about. I was hooked from the beginning of the movie..<br /><br />This is very suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This movie keeps your attention. We do not have cable so it was great to see this for free on regular T.V.<br /><br />We found a used copy for $4.99 plus a 15% discount with our coupon. This will make a great addition to our movie library.<br /><br />Enjoy... Client Eastwood was great as usual!

B005EHQGTS|5.0|My 1920 x1200 desktop monitor has the same resolution as the 8.9in Kindle Fire HD (KFHD8.9) so full screen works perfectly. Beautiful screen picture. Great product! This even allows me to watch Windows Media Center (WMC) and Ceton InfiniTV recordings from my computer on the KFHD8.9 at other locations in my WiFi range. Two issues though. WMC cannot be full screen, but it can be close. And icons and windows (upper right corner X) on the computer screen can be too small even for a capacitive stylus to target easily using the KFHD8.9. Enlarging the view by separating fingers triggers other STRD-HD modes that complicate accessing the computer screen using the KFHD8.9. But this is an amazing app.

B008RTE066|5.0|I have not been a huge fan of Limited Edition/Collectible type musical product, generally being more particularly focused on the music alone.  This Box Set, however, may have awakened in me an appreciation for well-presented nostalgia.  I was so excited when it arrived, tearing off the shrink wrap and marveling at the contents within.  Everything about this package is beautifully done.  The booklet, the vinyl, the DVD/Blu-Ray discs are all housed and presented impeccably.  The inclusion of the \\"Tour Ticket\\" actually adds to the sense that you're actually about to experience something that takes you somewhere else.  And it does.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have stated, it doesn't matter that the film sequences themselves are silly and unfocused, it's The Beatles, man!  To see the Fab Four just as they were at, arguably, their absolute creative peak is a charge, no matter how ridiculous the setting.  And when you spend ten minutes watching a meandering story-line that's book-ended by such remarkable songs as, say, \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" and \\"I Am the Walrus,\\" what is there worth complaining about?<br /><br />Which brings me back to the music.  The 5.1 is stunning.  The craftmanship of the writing and production of these classic tunes has never been more apparent, or more timeless.  I sat alone in my living room as giddy as if the boys were actually there performing live for me.  The only drawback for me is that, having been originally exposed to this music on the 11-track American album version, I really felt a little short-changed by the omission of the Side 2 tracks.  Especially since \\"Hello Goodbye\\" is teased over the closing credits and as a stand-alone promo video, why was this not also presented in glorious surround sound?  Plus, knowing that promotional \\"music videos\\" were shot for \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Penny Lane,\\" I wondered why this would not have been an appropriate place to have presented those clips in 5.1 as bonus material.  At which point, it would have only made sense to have taken one last extra step and at least presented \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\" and \\"All You Need is Love\\" in surround as well.  My hope is that the reason is that there is more Beatles 5.1 on the horizon, and that there will be a more appropriate package to present such material in the near future.<br /><br />Minor grievances aside, I could not possibly rate this overall package as anything less than 5 stars.  I highly recommend it!point, it would have only made sense to have taken one last extra step and at least presented \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\" and \\"All You Need is Love\\" in surround as well.

B0040QYROK|5.0|My favorite movie ever!  For the time it was made it was revolutionary! A must see, and I definitely learned much more watching the extended version of what the director wished to convey
B004W1GCQO|5.0|You know how when you watch a movie that touches you in some way; you identify with the actors. They become your closest friends and you care what happens to them.<br /><br />This show grabbed me that way from the start.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|I expect to refer to this book often as I convert my written outlines into e-books.  I have seen some amateurish-looking e-books and want to make sure mine look professional.  This resource covers the essential information for setting up fonts, intenting, and other little things that make a book look right in the Kindle format.
B004SIP7AS|1.0|This DVD has to be a pirated copy. The color was poor, then not long after it started playing the captions come on  (and couldn't be turned off) then the captions stopped after one chapter. The start menu looked homemade and color garish. Feel ripped off to have been sold a fake.

B00AAX68HG|3.0|good game but adds are everywhere and the cheats are way too expensive for six it is almost $3. Say get it BUT BEWARE OF ADDS
B002PMV9FG|4.0|As far as explanations, I preferred the book better to the movie.  The Half-Blood Prince gives the history of Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort--and the explanations were more interesting and extensive in the book rather than in the movie.  However, the movie gives you enough information so that you will understand the later plots in the following sequels.<br /><br />However, there is one thing I do like better in the movie than in the book--there are more scenes with Bellatrix Lestrange! For someone who was the Dark Lord's most faithful servant, who went to Azkaban for 14 years because she refused to renounce him, I felt J.K. failed to give her enough scenes and character development.  The movie gave this character more screen time, and Helena Bonham Carter is always the person you should go to to play a lunatic.  She is so good at it, I really question her mental stability in real life.<br /><br />This movie allows you to see the good side to some characters you thought were bad, and it begins to make you uncertain about characters you thought were good.  It also prepares you for the many deaths of well-loved characters that are to come.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|WOW, only an Irishman could tell his story so poetically. I loved reading, laughing and crying my heart out with this story. How I failed to read it sooner is baffling to me.

0440246318|5.0|Hitching rides, Reacher is picked up by McQueen and King. In the back is Karen Delfuenso, who doesn't have much to say as McQueen drives. Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri enter and fade as Reacher is driven on bewildering routes through some pretty desolate hinterlands in pursuit of something or other.  There has been a knifing and there are police roadblocks on all conceivable routes radiating from that point. Reacher begins to figure out that he and Karen Delfuenso are meant to get them past the police, who are looking for two men in a car. The reader may strain to figure out the plot but eventually gives up and simply rides with them for hundreds of miles this way and that.  FBI Special Agent Julia Sorenson and the CIA get on their trail.<br /><br />The bonus short story was indeed a bonus and of course I am going to buy Never Go Back.<br /><br />The ending to A Wanted Man is satisfying, but my word, was all that driving driving driving necessary?

0316212261|5.0|Laugh out loud, wonderful combining of multiple genres; entertaining, sweet, sincere in parts, but always, always, ALWAYS a page turner! I will be reading her YA series if not simply to remain in her endearing world of adventure, but to cling to that sense of fun! And for some bizarre reason, I feel like the recent release of \\"Blurred Lines\\" by Robin Thicke/Pharrell/TPain somehow relays the exact sense of cheeky fun that is The Parasol Protectorate!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved everything about this book, the characters, the twists and turns of the plot. I polished it off in record time as I was just dying to find out what happened. Highly recommended!

B004DH8IK0|5.0|When you play this CD you will probably find yourself turning the volume up & up & up - becuase the bass just sounds so good. After Listening to it a few times I searched for other similar sounding albums. but the only other ones I found were Hold Your Color & In Silico - Pendulum have there own unique sound.  This is one of the few albums were every track is great.

I was playing game when an app for a new game came up.It deleted my last move for feeding my horse that cost coins etc.It took my coins did give me credit.So I no longer have this APP. I also got tried of the pop ups while you are playing the game.This game was better without all of popup adds.When I first got this it did not have any Popups. Was fun when you could play without popups.

Go for it, knowing the other explorers, you will find it very useful. ES explorer is an utility that helps you to find many answers about your files on a tablet.I used many APKs but did not know the things about them while using. With ES explorer, many things are clear for me, moving them from one folder to the required one to reorganize my created files was easy and possible only thanks to ES explorer.I like it a lot and use it without fear or any probs.

B00A81NFAS|4.0|I read the book first, and I have to admit that it was hard for me to enjoy the movie at first because it was very different from the book. However, the actors did a wonderful job, and a few of the changes in the movie were in the right direction. They gave the father a much more positive personality than in the book, so he was likeable. I'm going to try and watch it again now that it's been a while since I read the book.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|Started off a little odd, but this page turner got better with every page.  Stick with it and you get rewarded.
B001V5CIFI|4.0|Received the movie in the mail and watched it immediately.  Enjoyed it.  Wonderful, magical movie for the whole family to watch.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I truly loved this movie because of the entertaining plot and the way people united to fight the same battle against all odds.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app. Its faster than any texting app i have!! I can see if my friends read my message i sent so quickly!! Its awesome. This app lets me talk to my cousins who live really far away. I always know whats going on with my friends. I can also stay in touch with my Aunt. This app is a MUST-have!!
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|The DVD came in great condition. I saw this movie in the theaters and I knew that I was going to be purchasing it when it came out on DVD. This is a HIGHLY recommended movie to get from Amazon.
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|It does not include the daily challenges. I have enjoyed Fairway Solitaire on my phone but this new version for Kindle is incomplete, and therefore disappointing.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Movie was good but the connection was interrupting every 30 minutes.  Watching the moviie with the connection constantly interrupting was not. Good experience.  Request refund.
0525425772|5.0|Never disappointed by Grisham. He writes a good story, looking forward to his next. His other story lines are also very entertaining too.
B00005JLCI|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter who had wanted this dvd for a long time. I Never saw it anywhere as it was not a hugely popular film. I was very glad to finally be able to get it for her.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|OPpThis game is fun I have played it on the computer but on my kindle it's not downloading  the bar hasn't even filled up at all and some of my apps say. &quot;Sorry there was an internal error &quot; it's annoying
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like playing this game because I get to run and buy stuff. That is very cool! (My 6 year old's critique)
B001EBV0IA|5.0|Buy it Great movie, classic western...some hokey moments...Eastwood is a classic western cowboy and his facial expressions are both comforting and terrifying at the same time.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Product arrived just as promised with all 5 discs brand spanking new!<br />I have ZERO complaints with Best Buy & will continue to do business with them.<br />Thanks!
B006RXSBS2|4.0|Really not for kids under 18 in my opinion.  Some extremely disturbing scenes that are over the top in bloodiness...horrific violence at times.  Good acting for the most part, superb staging and scenery, but again, this is a very gruesome, dark film.
0345529057|5.0|One of the best stories I've read in a long while!<br />The twists, turns, betrayals, and unexpected Hero's will make your head explode!
B000W9399S|5.0|I've heard nothing but rave reviews of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, of which this is the first.  I've also heard that the series gets better and better as it goes along.  If that's the case, I can't wait to keep reading more.  The Color of Magic introduces us to the odd universe of Discworld, inhabited by some of the most quirky and interesting characters you can imagine.  It's fantasy, it's parody, and it's comedy.  I laughed on nearly every page, and marveled as a fellow writer at Terry Pratchett's incredibly inventive imagination and ability to describe outlandish things in a way that is both informative and almost poetic.  If you are thinking of reading Terry Pratchett for the first time, this is a great place to start.  It will not be the last of his works you read, I'm sure.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|I seldom buy movies because there are few I want to see more than once.  This is one of the exceptions.  The acting, photography, music and even the violence were all relevant and necessary (I did close my eyes during the snakes in the river scene).  Of course, what else do  you need to say than &#34;Tommy Lee Jones&#34; and it is bound to be a winner.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This is literally one of thebest zombie movies. It's hilarious but still has the action, danger, and of course the gore!! I love it :)
1455523550|5.0|Well, I just finished reading my first Nicholas Sparks book. I knew he wrote \\"rip your heart out\\" kind of books but  Wow! It really needs to come with it's own supply of tissues. It's wonderful to think there are perfect men out there. Yet, on the other hand it's terrifying to know there really are sick, evil men out among us. I figured Jo out pretty quick but that didn't ruin the story. Quick, run out and buy stock in tissue companies because now I'll have to read the rest of his books as well.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I miss shows like this, the good guys always win.  Loved the characters and the premise of a small town with a genius population in dangerous situations rescued by the common man hero! It's Syfy Lite. I would re-watch this show with my kids over all the reality TV garbage out there.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun way to pass time. Navigating around rooms better than other games of this type that I've played. Looking forward to new levels.
0316077046|5.0|EXCELLENT READ! tHIS AUTHOR IS FANTASTIC IN DRAWING THE READER INTO THE STORY. lOVED IT. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LIKES FICTION FANTASY
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great game definitely with the cash<br />It plays well<br />It takes up a lot of space but we'll worth it
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I happened to hear the leak at a friend's house and then bought it immediately after. Kanye West is the most ambitious rapper of this past decade, easy. He clearly has knack for finding sounds that aren't supposed to sound well together then making it sound absolutely beautiful.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think minecraft pocket edition is fun but it is not my favorite game.(I am New to creating reviews so.do not call me stupid.
0307895475|5.0|Skyrim is not that hard of a game to be honest, and this book clarifies any possible question one could have.  I found it was more interesting to read this book while I was not playing, and to learn the story and the world of Skyrim.  It didn't take away from the Skyrim experience for me, if anything, it enriched it!
B007T7MIR0|5.0|Just what I needed to open some of these darn attachments and pdf files and a lot of other weird files that adobe wouldn't open.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Well written and acted. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie; now looking forward to #2!  It was very easy renting from Amazon.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|\\"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly and then all at once.\\" (125) This, in a nutshell, describes the book for me. I started reading The Fault In Our Stars and then just fell into the story.<br /><br />I honestly read this book after seeing a blurb in Entertainment Weekly about the upcoming movie and thought it sounded interesting. Yeah, interesting. Now that I am able to breathe again, after crying for about 3/4 of the book and well after I finished it, I am finding I have no words to describe the book, except that I loved it, but after saying how it affected me, saying I loved it seems wrong.<br /><br />The story was amazing, it drew me in through my tears and I just kept going. Hazel and Augustus' story was uplifting and heartbreaking. Their connection and Hazel's reaction to it and the subsequent \\"event\\" flowed, as it just broke your heart. This is definitely a must read and has me curious enough to read more of the author's books. The emotion was captured so well, it felt like you were there, going through every step with Hazel, Augustus and Issac through it all.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like the challenge and variety in the rooms.  I have yet to get  into the other floorsdue to kindle breakdown.
B005K17RU0|5.0|was really impressed with the radar feature. it was a little hard to work at first, but finally figured it out
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|WAY BETTER than Subway Surfers or Temple Run. It's a great game for fans of the movies. Was a little slow to download, though, and get working for the first time.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This app is so fun. My brother loves it also. You really do need to rate this app. It's cool!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This was great.  I was looking for some games for the kindle and I have to admit this one was addictive.  Kudos for all that were involved in this app.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Good job.  I will look for more apps from Gameloft.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Whats better than being a shark and eating people? NOTHING this game i  the bees knees. I think you will like it too
B009IH0ICG|3.0|I bought a cheap brand of chimney last year and it lasted one season. Decided I liked the concept and debated between this model and the larger size. Wish I had moved up to the larger model. Construction is well done. The recommended method of using a piece of newspaper to start the process is unreliable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing app my kids love it my boyfriend loves it I love it everyone loves  you should get this app
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I like her writing style, but the excitement from the first couple of books was definitely not in this book.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I probably was expecting more excitement in the book I didn't say I didn't like it but I didn't really enjoy it as the one before this book left me with no excitement at the end but I'll wait for the next one not very please
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|His app is AMAZING! It has really good graphics but it has some glitches. If you are trying to deciding whether to buy this app or not u should totally get it!!!! This is the best app i have.
B000URDCC6|5.0|it was such a long movie,I just putting off watching it!  But, after a slow start, I really got into it!  Not the best movie, but it was very entertaining.
1476734941|5.0|Easiest plan to aid in weight loss.  Clear, concise and more than anything it works.  Recommend this for all the long time strugglers.
B00782O7IY|2.0|i can't imagine how this stupid film won the oscar! At least the dog played an excellent part.  He should have won an Oscar!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!! I love horses and this game is the one for me! Best 3d game so far!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I wanted to play a new game and thought I'd give it a try.  I like it!! and I think you will too!!
B00013M6NK|5.0|Just what I needed as my very old battery was no longer holding a charge.  Shipped in time for family pictures.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Never played a lot of games before, found this game, fast, fun and challenging.  I am sure that you'll enjoy this one.
B008VBYN80|5.0|It's a great game and the graphics are mind blowing. I wish this was available on a console. My only problem is that I had it on my phone and I wish the data transfers over.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Kills an otherwise fun game<br /><br />I enjoy the graphics wish you could pull from all cards to build deck in campaign mode
B003R0MF1W|5.0|The Mentalist is very funny. I liked it a lot. Simon Baker is a good actor because he makes his character about the mentalist very good.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I like almost all of these songs. She never fails to deliver in my eyes. And she appears to have a good moral character too. Love this about her. I also appreciate the fact that she sounds well live and is not just a mixing board singer.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|I bought the original LP about 45 years ago and auctioned it off with a stack four foot high stack of other LPs in 2000 because I wanted to purchase it on a CD because of better Sound Quality and Storage Convenience.<br /><br />I was amazed to hear the improvement over the Old LP - Technology Triumphs.<br /><br />I'm 66 years old and Bless Myself when I hear that album and other Remastered Beatles CDs I recently purchased because I witnessed the Beatles evolving, splitting-up, dying, assassinated, etc. and in my opinion there will never be another group that will ever parallel them.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get this Remastered CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a very fun and entertaining game. A great way to spend your available time playing. You'll really enjoy it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Some plays are very challenging but the challenge makes you want to conquer it and continue to play.<br /><br />I would recommend it.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|It's better than SUPERMAN RETURNS but that's not saying much.  Cavill makes a decent Clark/Kal-El (\\"Superman\\" isn't acknowledged in the end titles), and Diane Lane acquits herself nicely as Martha Kent, but Amy Adams is an awful Lois (Lois Lame might be a more appropriate name for her character), and Laurence Fishburne's Perry White (complete with earring! ) is more Frank Langella than Jackie Cooper.  The one casting choice I had high hopes for was Michael Shannon as Zod, and while he brings a great deal of menace to the proceedings, he lacks the calm, cool confidence of Terence Stamp's interpretation.  Perhaps modern audiences expect their villains to be over-the-top bad asses with no shades of grey, and if that's the case, then this new Zod delivers.  Christoper Meloni, one of my favourite LAW & ORDER actors, has a nice supporting role as an army officer.<br /><br />But my main quibble with the film is the way it approaches the action sequences.  Perhaps I'm out of step with the times, but I don't see the point in making a SUPERMAN movie where it's painfully obvious all the actors are standing in front of a green screen and the \\"epic\\" digital action is out of focus and cut with attention deficit sufferers in mind.  When Christopher Reeve played Superman, you could actually see his derring-do whereas in MAN OF STEEL the action is cut so quickly you have to guess.  Also, the Kryptonian architects were most definitely inspired by H.R. Giger this time out, so it's little wonder Jor-El and the Missus had no interest in raising a child in such a dark and uninviting environment.  One last note:  I'm glad they didn't try to tack the Williams SUPERMAN theme onto this as it wouldn't have worked, but Hans Zimmer completely misses the mark with his score for MAN OF STEEL.
B004G600A4|5.0|The product was in great shape considering I got it second hand. It plays well, no scratches or anything! I got my order on time and really prompt after I ordered. This is an excellent service and I will definitely be using it again!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|One of the Best games I've played in a while. And I have to fill the required word minimum so there I did it
B005723JSQ|2.0|Predicable and dull at times, footnotes are too numerous, and sometimes distracting. She's trying to recreate the best parts of remember me and can you keep a secret..didn't quite make it.
1619696231|5.0|There is not a book that I have read or heard by David Baldacci that I have not enjoyed - will continue to be a fan of his work!!!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Matthew McConaughey plays a great attorney role.  Movie has a good story line with a great ending.  Loved it! Wow!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I have had this game since the day I got my Kindle fire HD, and I am now a level 40 something. this game is excellent and the crossbreed varieties are amazing! My only problem with the game is that I can now no longer move forward because all of the quests require me to spend actual money.if only they could make it so that there is an entire list of missions instead of just 5 at time, it would be great!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Anyone who has had a baby can relate to this movie.  I laughed my head off in the last half of the movie.
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|Seriously, I'm kidding by Ellen Degeneres was hilarious and relate-able. It was an easy read with agreeable topics. The audio version was a great easy listen as well and I loved that Ellen made the audio book herself. She cracks me up and turns my day around. I enjoyed both the book and audio book.<br /><br />Samantha J Houston<br />Self-Published Author<br />Check out my book: Another Lasting Smile
B00821PCJS|3.0|This has Good action and pulls you in very quickly. Looking forward to more in the series and character development.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|great service, great series, can't go wrong with it.  I will enjoy and watch it for many years to come and highly recommend it to all.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|this is a good game but you have to buy the full verizon too if you want the whole matching outfit.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I bought this because mine was stolen!  What does that tell you?!  Had to have another one.  It's timeless Elvis.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|If you are interested in this DVD, it is probably because you have watched the series on Showtime network and know perfectly well that it is sensational. But if, like me, you appreciate the subtitle feature of DVDs because your hearing isn't the best and much of the dialogue is whispered or murmured, then please be aware that this series carries no English language subtitles.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|What a wonderufl trip down memory lane!  The songs (best I can tell) occur chronologically.  Great road trip sing along album.  Leaves me in a great mood!
3832793836|5.0|one of the most amazing books,full of amazing images and very inspiring ! its worth every single penny. loved it!
B0014BEDBG|5.0|I pretty much like all things JT! I heard about this concert years after it was on HBO and recently tracked it down on Netflix. After 10 minutes into the DVD I knew I had to own it!<br /><br />The concert interviews are a plus to the great music and dance performance. The second DVD is very short focused on the business of pulling the MSG concert together.
B000WEMH3C|1.0|The grill cover lasted about three hours before it ripped on the top seam and had to be returned.  Weber should get its name off this product as it is inconsistent with the high quality of the rest of their grill products.
B004DTXJ4S|4.0|This was awesome, my son and I spent the whole day watching &#34;Resident Evil&#34;. I can't believe I never watched any of them before.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|Great game but Wizards is ruining it with the amount of money required to play. 9.99 plus money for packs and decks. Too bad. They need to stop ripping us off.
B00AZMFO6I|2.0|I love British film, telly and have been an avid collector for years. So I quickly grabbed this Vine choice and felt I'd scored a win. After viewing, I  was tempted to give a one star review, but I can't really say I hated this film because I did get to see some fine actors do their usual good work. But I can honestly say I did not like it.<br /><br />This film was a disappointing waste of time and of a Vine choice. Looking at the cast list I expected a nice little film, Brit style. Alas, perhaps to \\"appeal to the younger viewers\\" the vulgar witticisms of Billy Connelly were injected at regular intervals. They failed to lighten the mood, however and the jokes fell flat as lead in the layer cake.<br /><br />After much sniggering and dithering, the film works itself up to the climax of Dame Smith uttering an F bomb at her old lover in the dining room. A pointless and embarrassing moment to be sure. Mr. Courtenay also gets his chance to utter a stream of four letter invectives at a young girl for no clear reason. Something to do with marmalade (!?)<br /><br />The problem here is not so much the profanity, but that it seemed out of character and did nothing to enhance or advance the story. So why sprinkle it around like some kind of poisonous pixie dust hoping movie magic will result? I suppose I should be grateful nobody gave birth bloody and screaming, threw up on someone or bared their breasts as this seems to happen in every other show nowadays.<br /><br />Maggie Smith was pitch perfect as always, as was Tom Courtenay. Pauline Collins turned in a good performance, always a treat to see her, but  she was miscast in her role. Her natural strength undermined her characters frailty. Another casting flaw was the girl who played the doctor and head of the nursing home. She would only have been believable as a pizza waitress. Expecting her to be a trained physician and in charge was asking too much of an audience who by this time was bored and thinking \\"don't I have laundry to do?\\" Now that I think of it, Pauline Collins would have been perfect in this part. Her wonderful blend of strength, sass and warmth would have given the other characters the pillar they needed to circle around.<br /><br />Michael Gambon's scenes were brief but it was fun watching him channel the spirit of Rex Harrison. He did him to the life. I assume it was intentional?<br /><br />There was a very thin storyline in the first place, which all this seasoned talent tried valiantly to support, yet despite their best efforts it could not be done.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman directed. I expect by now he's hiding someplace and drinking heavily.<br /><br />Sad waste of talent all around. Don't waste your time and money.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Me and my friend Skyler and her brother Levi both enjoy this app! We are friends in the game and we give each other gifts. Awesome app!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|It does not even work! It's a virus it keeps on freezing and shouting my kindle off! I undownload it! Don't get this game!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This is the most money hungry app I have ever played. Who ever heard of running out of energy?  You're supposed to tend animals, build shanties,  raise crops (and that's  not all) just to be yelled at by your spouse that you've run out of energy &amp; better buy more! Yes. For real cash. I like to play a game at my leisure, not just the 3 to 5 minutes I am allowed before running out of energy!  Maybe if they made a way to rest between chores, but right now it's an expensive and frustrating waste of time when there are SO MANY better FREE games available. Don't waste your time (and money)  on this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv subway surfers so much I'm addicted to playing it please continue to make more games like it and continue to make different versions of it like Paris and Rio.I have a question what's after Paris?
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is a fantastic replacement keyboard. Predictions are very intuitive, and the UI is simple and easy  to use. Easy to customize. One of the best apps I have ever paid for. Highly recommended!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Took a bit to figure out but once you get the hang of it, the challenge is great. One of the better games available.
1616614609|5.0|even though the current card pool is no where near as deep as Magic: the Gathering, Android Netrunner is more intricate, more fun, and takes a lot more strategy. I do like that the game is a &#34;living&#34; card game, as opposed to one with &#34;collectibles&#34;.  Future expansion packs will feature a fixed and unchanging set of 40 cards each. This means that there is no market for rare or powerful cards. It's like communism.... but for a fantasy card game. This makes the game much more accessible to the casual player, which I think is a good thing for games like this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story line and a lot of action katniss is a awesome character and a great romantic feel to it
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This wasn't a BAD movie- the acting was good, the cinematography was fine, it had it's &#34;jump&#34; moments.<br />That said, there was some disturbing imagery (I know it's a horror movie, but there are different types of &#34;disturbing imagery&#34;), so if you're concerned, I would recommend going on IMDB.com, looking this movie up and checking the &#34;Parents Guide&#34;. It will tell you what is show in the movie that you may be concerned about.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|great book couldn't hardly put it down may husband really enjoyed it ...and he was in the air force 26 years.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Good information for anyone who wants to understand and accept life. Book not difficult to read. Highly recommend this to all ages.
B00153ZC8Q|4.0|I watched The Terminator Years ago,  i dont remember if it was on a v h s tape or not,  but i liked it THEN,  so NOW i have it on a DVD.  Warner Jones.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|:)<br />Fan tas tic app.  Rec com mend you give it a whirl..  you will not reg ret it.  I pro mi se
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am by no means an animal lover, but this book was nothing short of amazing. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who lives to read.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Very funny, but some of the conversation was faint and hard to understand.  This may have been because of the age of the DVD.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|It's a little slower paced than the first 3 books.  It's still a good story, and I can't wait for the end of the series!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game, lots of fun. But minus a star because of the inconsistent synching when the cities change. If that improves then worth five stars.
B0014JLYS8|4.0|I love these shoes... they are super comfy and make my work day better. I usually wear a 10.5... so as instructed I ordered an 11, however, once they were worn a couple times they are a little too loose. I should have gotten a size 10... They are not as SLIP RESISTANT as other brands I wear, but they make up for that in comfort. I suffer from Plantar Faciitis.... they really help. The arch and natural heel bed helps to stabilize my foot and my pain is decreased. They are easy to clean also.
B005DKLPF6|5.0|To me this album is like the Mastodon record to sorta hook you in if you aren't already a fan. Otherwise, you might be a fan already and A. like this but find it a little disappointing compared to say- the previous record(s)... B.Like the first couple of records and HATE everything after C. One of those fans who likes everything in the catalog. or maybe you are D. None of the above mentioned...whatever.<br />I like this one but found it a little disappointing in places. Not enough to cry that Mastodon sold their souls to satan in favor of whatever it is they were looking for. In a day in age where no one really buys records anymore is that applicable?<br />Especially rock records? Nevermind- metal records. Or...ones of the proggy nature? I just don't see it.<br />I for one found The Hunter a breath of fresh air in places. Less progressive than previous endeavors yes, although that's still present. (ie. Octopus has no friends, bedazzled fingernails) Yes, there's still plenty of monolith riffs and bottom end in the guitar. Yes, still plenty of Brann's amazing drum fills. Yes, Scott Kelly of Neurosis makes a guest appearance on a track \\"Spetrelight\\" - the album's heaviest moment. There's a few other moments where all three vocalists come together- Brann, Troy and Brent- harmonizing in all their glories. (dry bone valley) A couple of moments Mastodon sounds like Queens of The Stone age meets Sabbbath (Curl of the Burl) and other moments where they sound like a heavier Alice In Chains. (again, Dry Bone Valley).<br />The moments where I wasn't quite sure what to make were The Creature Lives, which isn't terrible, but sorta feels like an arena rock \\"ballad\\" that drags on a little. Please remember this is only my opinion. And by no means does it mean it spoil the album for me...Because there's enough great to ignore the few hiccups...Overall, good disc.  Highlights: Blasteroid, Stargasm, Spectrelight, Bedazzled, and Black Tongue.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Enough said it has , a big glitch installing. Even though it's a big game the glitch is what keeps me down
B00D3V8PSC|4.0|Lets clear a couple of things up.<br />No Bill Ward. No real reunion. Oh well.<br />Sabbath is back in 3/4th's anyway.<br />How is 13? Time will tell where it holds up to the classic Sabbath stuff. It certainly taps into all the right places.<br />Beginning of the end is sorta like the template for \\"Black Sabbath\\"- the opener from the debut album, albeit modern production values. Iommi's trademark tri tone riffing and what's often referred to as \\"doom\\"- opens with no apologies power chord riffing.<br />Before going into what I'd say is the other side of Iommi's riff choices, a sorta uptempo shuffle with Butler doubling underneath- doing all the traditional bass fills. Ozzy still sounds like Ozzy. Sorry but the next track God is Dead, while having good ideas is presented in 8+ minutes, and while Sabbath does have their share of lengthier tunes, feels sorta ...boring. Thankfully the next track \\"Loner\\" while feeling somewhat like \\"NIB\\" at least gets to the meat of the song. One thing becomes apparent with 13 is that it's not trying to reinvent the wheel. Instead, it traces back to it's roots a little- and at the same time feels not so out of place with modern hard rock. \\"Zeitgeist\\" is the track that harkens back to Paranoid and Master of Reality's psychedelic moments- \\"Planet Caravan\\" and \\"Solitude\\". Although the big difference is Ozzy isn't trying to sing softly he's singing in his trademark tone. (yes, Ozzy sings on those tracks!) \\"Age of Reason\\" to me is the first real Black Sabbath song that sounds like a band finding it's voice again. Lyrically, musically- i dug this song, a lot. Blues tinged, a little doomy- at times reminding me of something that would have easily been on Sabotage. There's other highlights the bluesy \\"Damaged soul\\" complete with Ozzy's harp accompanying the band. \\"Dear Father\\" is another killer track worth checking out. The bonus tracks are even cool for what they are. My only real gripe are a handful of recycled riffs found on earlier albums- {tell me the riff at the 6 minute mark of God is Dead isn't Hole in the Sky?}<br />Brad Wilk while filling nicely into Ward's shoes- isn't Bill Ward. There's a sense of danger in Bill Ward's playing that's sorta missing in Wilk's playing. Brad Wilk does a good impression of Ward, but obviously is holding back a little to not outshine the other 3. I'm sure this was intentional. Overall, I did enjoy 13- and I'm glad I bought it. Welcome back guys.<br />...While your at it- go check out Heaven and Hell's The Devil You know. Also a good disc at points and sadly- Dio's swansong.
B0063M22QO|4.0|But overall, not bad. They start easy and get progressively harder. Then there are different &#34;games&#34; within the game. It's not as good as the PC version, but it's nice to kill time and veg out for a few minutes while I'm nursing the baby. :)
B0071MQ37E|5.0|I never got around to seeing &#34;Phantom&#34; on Broadway.  Now in it's 25th Anniversary year I just caught it on PBS.  Blew me away!  I immediately ordered the video, had to have it, and Amazon's &#34;immediate viewing&#34; option set me on fire.  Now I absolutely love this show.  The Royal Albert Hall production is sensational.  What a glorious kick in my ass for procrastinating 25 years to see the wonderful &#34;Phantom of the Opera.&#34;  This video is a keepsake, go for it!
B005NNVPOO|5.0|I finally got around to re-acquiring this one after having owned it on vinyl &#34;back in the day&#34;. As the years have passed, I have taken the time to truly appreciate David Gilmour's lyrical guitar phrasing, and breath-taking mastery of the instrument. I can now see that &#34;Animals&#34; was shoehorned into something resembling a &#34;concept&#34; album, not knowing back then that &#34;Dogs&#34; and &#34;Pigs&#34; were actually reworkings of pieces that didn't make the cut for &#34;Wish You Were Here&#34; (their greatest moment, IMHO). This is not to say that those songs are lacking; &#34;Dogs&#34; in particular continues to stand out. That famous &#34;twin Telecasters&#34; solo is still heart-breaking more than 25 years later. Gilmour's playing seems the most &#34;violent&#34; on this record, compared to on any other of Floyd's &#34;song-based&#34; albums. Quite a different style to the elegant double-bends and atmosphere of &#34;The Wall&#34; and later works. Only &#34;Sheep&#34; fails to carry its weight, in comparison to the other pieces, but again, it does have excellent guitar work at the end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is pretty.....pretty good, in my opinion. It's a really good mobile game, but compared to the other versions of Minecraft, it isn't all that great. It is lacking in several major and minor features, such as enchanting weapons and tools, and a majority of the mobs such as Endermen, Blazes, and Slimes don't make an appearance in the game. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great tablet/smartphone game. But, it just doesn't beat the overall greatness of the PC edition of Minecraft. Oh, yeah. There's also an XBox 360 version of Minecraft, but seriously, who the heck cares?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This Crossfire series was an excellent read. The journey between Eva and Gideon was hot and spell binding. Recommend it to all.
B00BY9GQHM|4.0|As previous reviewers have said, this is mostly hidden objects. I prefer more puzzles myself so wasn't that enchanted with the game. However, I knew it was HO before purchasing so I do not fault the game. I \\"bought\\" the thermometer and the jack in the box every time that I could which made the game more interesting for me...finding the thermometer right away so I could avoid touching it until I needed to use it. If you love hidden objects, this game is for you! The HO are done very well....
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I ordered these because I couldn't get Seasons 2 & 3 on Netflix. I am so glad I purchased these. They were excellent quality for used & would order from this seller again!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game played very well. Lots of hours of enjoyment. Good mix between hidden object and mini puzzles. Some puzzles nicely challenging. I bought the extra content and the cost was on a par with other games--about $3. I love this type of game and it didn't disappoint. I like G5 games. Well worth the money.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The arrival and packaging made my inner fangirl squeal in delight. All things promised were there.  However, the music box actually fell apart due to the glue that glued the music machine to the box somehow dried and didn't work anymore. So that's the only thing that let me down.<br /><br />The letter was very nice too.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|This is the only album that I have of IZ but I can't imagine there is a better one.  All the songs are beautifully arranged and I listen to them often.  Hope you enjoy this rainbow in your heart!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is the best game ever I like the new update and the new armor . This is one of the best iron man games ever.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I  just happened across this novel and it had such rave reviews that I bought it. Wow! I loved it! This book is shockingly rich with characters and the underlying theme of music is genius. You Won't regret reading this one!
B008K9SG9K|4.0|Imagine Dragons has written some really beautiful, vibrant songs that are so melodiously perfect & lyrical to the ear like \\"Demons\\", \\"It's Time\\", & my choice for next release: \\"Every Night\\". The band is definitely popular this year & w/ deserved kudos. Variety permeates this CD, but it's also closely linked musically. They have written some of the best hooks I've heard in some time--a difficult task for sure. You will be absolutely contented w/ Night Visions, & \\"Radioactive\\" is the tits & the bomb.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have found I sleep well during rain storms, so after purchasing I went to sleep listening to rain storm and slow waves. It was such a peaceful rest that I received. I look forward to trying the other sounds also.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I love 30 Seconds to Mars, & have all their CDs. Their new CD didn't totally shock me when I only heard one song w/ backing & rhythm guitar (Conquistador) & 11 tracks all synthesizer & percussion backed. Jared Leto has been moving towards synthetic sounds since This is War & past bands like Foreigner broke up because Mick Jones (the main song writer & leader of the group) wanted to take the band the electronic route w/  songs like \\"I Wanna Know What Love Is\\", \\"Urgent\\", \\"Break it Up\\", & \\"Goodbye Yesterday\\". Whereas, Lou Gramm insisted & fought to keep the band in guitars like w/ \\"Double Vision\\", \\"Dirty White Boy\\", & \\"Head Games\\". Still all 12 tracks on Love, Lust, Faith, & Dreams are excellent, dramatic, multilayered polyphonic songs, w/ two and a half that have no lyric. This CD feels influenced by Eastern tradition & Indian culture & feel, despite its pounding, pulsating beats, deep synthetic bass (& guitar bass, too). It seems like 30 Seconds really wanted some dj to convert their tunes on this CD to club mixes. Many of the songs are easily sent into this techno genre like the initial release, \\"Up in the Air\\", but the same could be done to \\"Northern Lights\\", Big Lights\\", & \\"Do or Die\\". Regardless, I love every song on all 4 of 30 Seconds' CDs. Jared Leto is really talented & his brother Shannon, is a really untraditional, eclectic, sometimes surprisingly subdued in his drum accompaniment. Like his almost nonexistent drums in the 1 song he contributed to the CD: \\"Convergence\\", which is an instrumental. Shannon's rolling, surreal, patterned beats are so in tune w/ the music Jared is creating & in most cases playing all or most of the non percussion instruments. If I had to say anything derogatory about 30 Seconds to Mars it would be w/ Jared Leto's lyrics, which on all his albums seem to include units of distance: \\"100 Suns\\", \\"93 Million Miles\\", \\"Year Zero\\". & Jared never writes a love song, a happy love song. He's the awesome king of writing hateful, bitter, condescending, screw you lady lyrics like \\"The Kill\\". I've come to love this about him, but there's one song on Love, Lust... that is happyish... \\"City of Angels\\". The song commemorates his teenage rebellion & being lost but becoming a success thanks to the \\"comfort of strangers\\". I have been to LA., people generally run from you if you say hello, but Jared finds all the good (money, acting, band) in one of the most desperate cities in the world. For what seems to many as desperation & downtrodden, Jared confirms as pertinent, transcendent victories. Wish all life worked that way. One last observation, Jared quit writing melodies that were at the very apex of his vocal register, namely the screaming, screeching he does on A Beautiful Lie & This is War, but not so much on their freshman self titled CD. Lots of thumping & jumping on this CD. You can't go wrong here. Every song is masterful & reflective.

0062255657|5.0|ME: Diehard fan and have read entire NG catalogue: I was not expecting flocks of killer flamingos as I like to meet NG on his own turf. What I got was a beautiful piece of work that intrigued me and I could not put it down. I was alarmed at first that the page count was so low, but once the story was finished and properly balanced, I said to myself; \\"This should be the last line,\\" and it was. I admire NG more than ever for his range as expressed in this wonderful story of love and longing. Good job NG! Keep up the good work! You have truly put a wormhole inside of a Mason jar this time and it will stay in my memory for years.
B000JIHP88|4.0|My 3 month DD old did not want to stay asleep at night, nor did she want to sleep in her crib during the day, so I thought it would be  a good idea to get a mobile. After spending hours of searching amazon and finding very many mobiles that don't do anything, don't last long enough or are defective, I decided on this one because we also have the other rainforest items (bouncy and play gym). It arrived in great shape, we put it together without a problem, and it works just fine. The only thing we ran into was that the remote didn't work, but since DD's crib is in our bedroom anyways, it wasn't a problem for us. The best part about this mobile is that it lasts 20 minutes. We've had it for 3 months now and it is still in great shape. I know a lot of reviews said that the leaves stopped working, but I have not run into that problem.The only real problem-and this may be because the other rainforest items that we have are play related- is that it doesn't put her to sleep. I was afraid of that when I bought this mobile, but I was pretty desperate, so I gave it a shot anyways. Once I turn it on, DD becomes wide awake and starts kicking her legs... she'll do many things except go back to sleep! So, needless to say it has become nothing more than a crib accessory: Something that is not, under any circumstances turned on, but nice for her to look at when she wakes up :). So, if you have the rainforest toys, like the bouncy chair and the play gym, it might keep baby awake if your baby is anything like mine.
B009NCM248|3.0|standard rock type album.  sounds ok.  I tend to like edgier stuff.  some tracks are heavier than others, and those are my favorites.
B0064W67IM|4.0|This is my first graphic novel.  If it had been lousy, it would have been my last graphic novel.  I'm not even sure why I picked it.  I had been looking at the top 100 books of all time as proposed by the staff of Entertainment Weekly.  The only graphic novel they recommended was Maus.  When I couldn't find it on Kindle, I started to look at the rest of the Kindle catalog.  I am so glad I did.  This was amazing!  I don't have the vocabulary necessary to adequately describe all the different aspects of the book which impressed me, but I was indeed impressed.  I had been concerned that having pictures with the story would ruin the experience for me.  I am very visual when I read.  I \\"see\\" the story in my mind.  That is the part of reading that comes from my imagination.  Seeing the artwork didn't ruin anything, it enhanced it.  I would buy another one of these in a minute.
159463176X|3.0|I really like Hosseini's other books and looked forward to reading this one. But rather than the beautiful books,with characters who drew you in, this was more a book of short stories held together only tenuously.  It starts out with a beautiful story of sibling devotion and then bounces  around all the peripheral characters the author drops into the story.  Most of the characters have minimal development and I didn't get a chance to really care about very many of them. I am not sorry I read it...it is a quick read, but I am sorry that he didn't write a better book.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|perfect for the I phone - Love the case price was average a bit less expensive then in the store
B00992CF6W|5.0|The fun part was the game, the not fun part was the fact it wouldn't download for about a week or two.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|Already being a fan of the TV series, discovering that the novels exist and are available in Kindle, was the find of the day.  Af first I was skeptical that the quality of the novel would equal that of the TV series but I was not disappointed.  The books have the same well developed character that exists in the TV series.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It has amazing features like biting flowers hot air ballons and don't even get me started on the flying monkeys this game is out of control and totally fun
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|A well told tale, of vampires, witches, daemon - each with unique yet intertwined stories. Oh, yes... Romance, too! Some flat moments when the author did go on a bit too long, but all in all, a nice escape.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|As I'm allergic to horses this game provides a way for me to care for and love a horse of my very own. It's very realistic and a dream come true!
B0022Y570K|5.0|Man, I've been listening to hard rock/metal since 1978, and this album totally, totally blew me away.  This reminds me of something that came out back in the metal glory days by Wrathchild America called 3-D...same kind of concept.  I wish I could give it ten stars because five stars doesn't give this album justice.
B009O2XY12|4.0|More of the same color bubbles you hit the better your score will be so go for it play the game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I first started this final book I ,like in the second book, found it hard to get into. But remember as you read the hunger games that everything Suzanne Collins writes about has meaning and connects. She does  a wonderful job lettingyou feel the characters. It was an amazing end to an amazing journey that the hunger games took me on. I'll never forget these books.

0062255657|4.0|I finished this book in one sitting and I liked it, but I'll admit that I couldn't help but get the feeling that this heavily referenced some of Gaiman's other works that I hadn't read. Well, more heavily referenced, in any case. I knew going into this that it was likely that he'd drop little bits or references to his other works. Gaiman has been known to do this, after all, but I couldn't quite help but feel that I'd probably have gotten more out of this if I'd read some of the more recent stuff he's done.<br /><br />In any case, this is an excellent book. It doesn't last very long and I'd say that most readers will be able to finish this in one sitting, probably long before they've even had a chance to finish whatever tasty beverage they have beside them. The story here is fairly simple. You have a kid that stumbles upon magical neighbors and accidentally brings over something that is intent on making his life miserable and taking over his family. His family is blissfully unaware of the danger that this person/creature puts them in, or at least is unaware of the danger for our young boy.<br /><br />This is magical, but at times the horror here is really much more mundane than magic. The threat Ursula (the baddie) poses is something that a lot of people might relate to: she's not only taking over the family and putting herself in the mother's place, but also manages to be mean to the boy (we never really know his name) without any repercussions from his parents or sister. There's something a little creepy about a creature that is pretty much ripping your home life apart in ways that have nothing to do with casting dark magical spells against everyone or turning them into frogs. Instead you have your main character feeling like it's \\"them versus me\\" for much of the portion where Ursula is a big threat.<br /><br />I'd complain about this being short, but then I think that this is exactly the length it should be. There's the potential for more books surrounding Lettie and her family, but for now this story is very well summed up in just over 100 pages. It's really a nice read and one I'd definitely recommend for Gaiman fans.and her family, but for now this story is very well summed up in just over 100 pages. It's really a nice read and one I'd definitely recommend for Gaiman fans.
B007HACDLK|4.0|One of my favorite things is to begin my summer with Vince Flynn's latest novel. I've read them all and they were very enjoyable. These books were easy to read and could be finished within a week. I'm sad there will be no more. Rest in peace Vince.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this book!  The writing puts you there, right in the middle of the action. She doesn't over-described, but just paints the picture for you in your mind!  Excellent!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Of course love the music, and the director's comments were worth getting the Special Edition. I am generally not a collector of DVD's, but since my husband references this movie often, I thought it would be nice to have and watch a few times. The extras available on the disk are worthwhile. In all honesty, reading the Kindle Book 'The Fort' prompted discussion of this movie and subsequently ordering the DVD.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|awesome and runs great on kindle fire.sealed is a nice addition and you get a promo pack for buying the full version
0449808696|4.0|Borrowed book on cd from library.  Great history of the processed food industry!  Everyone should be aware of the ingredients in the food they buy.  The food manufacturing industry has taken great pains to ensure that their products have plenty of appeal by including large amounts of salt, sugar and fat.  This contributes to the obesity problem we have in our country, so it's wise to be informed! Personally I avoid these foods and this book gives me even more reasons why it's important to do so.  I prefer whole organic foods and the thought of eating something like fritos or cheetos makes me feel nauseous after reading this book!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Christina Baker Kline did a great deal of research to write this book about a group of orphans who were carted across the country to find adoptive parents.  Their stories are heart breaking but told with great humanity.  I really liked this book.

B000LXQVA4|4.0|My seven month old absolutely loves this jumper. It allows her a great range of motion than other jumpers and the toys are interactive. This jumper was fairly easy to put together (my husband was able to assemble it in 20 minutes). I would recommend this jumper to others. I took a star off because it is overpriced on Amazon, and is cheaper at Wally World
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This cast of acotors did not let me down.  They each brought their own personality, humor and wisdom to the screen.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has written another blockbuster.  This book kept my interest throughout and was different from the other ones that he wrote.  I liked the fact that the story weaved between characters and eras.  Unitil I had each name and character clear in my mind, it was a tad confussing.  Once I put it all together it was a facinating story of devotion, love of family, and desperation in heartbreaking poverty.  I was never bored and highly recommended it to friends and family.
B001OSIV62|4.0|I had been wanting to see this one for a while and was not disappointed. Intriguing and amazing story that leaves you caught up in how they pulled if off.

B000KX0HVY|5.0|Contains lots of great songs.  Reasonably priced.  I've listened to it on my commute quite often.  I've come to really appreciate The King.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Really nice case for kindle fire.  I wish it came in additional colors - a blue or green would be nice, or some other neutral besides black (even a grey).  Has a nice feel in the hand, elastic strap is very sturdy and functional, stand up works great in portrait mode.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|As someone who saw the movie first (and liked it), this helps fill in the gaps about the characters' thoughts, motives, and feelings. Really enjoyed it. Already bought the other two books. Want to read them before the movies come out. More detailed and gruesome than the movie, but not too bad for Tweens and older. Gave 4 instead of five stars because perfection is hard to archive. We will see how the others rate!
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|This was a wonderful movie - funny and heart warming.  Very enjoyable!  The whole family really enjoyed watching it.  I highly recommend it.

B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I don't like musicals, but the wife said I had to watch this. Glad I did, it was hilarious! Good music with a ton of comedy tossed in. Some slap stick and others well thought out. Favorite characters are Fat Amy and the girl who talks extremely quietly.<br /><br />Must see for comedy movie lovers!
1933952806|4.0|Definitely not a disappointment. A very informative, readable and absorbing book for anyone interested in photography and, of course, the D7000.

0763644765|5.0|My daughter is almost two and is just being introduced to the potty. She recognizes that this book is about the potty and likes to read it while we sit on the potty. There is something about the drawings and the cadence in which it was written that she is really drawn to. She gets super excited at the end when the baby and the parents are so happy with the potty success and she enjoys that there is a kitty and doggie, too. Personally, I think the baby in he book is adorable and its a very sweet little story.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Always loved playing solitary and this ap allows me to play it anywhere I have my Kindle! The reason for the 4 stars is the occasional interruption of the game with a pop up ad......other than that, quite enjoyable!
1400069807|5.0|Salt, Sugar, Fat:  How the Food Giants Hooked Us<br />By<br />Michael Moss<br /><br />Obesity, processed foods, marketing to kids, etc. are almost daily news today as we face a health epidemic, not just an obesity epidemic.  The food giants, large corporations have made it a science to lure the public, with a huge emphasis on children, into eating cheap, convenient, unhealthy foods.  Mr. Moss has done an excellent job of describing how these corporations have knowingly spent and made billions of dollars on these efforts and are hugely responsible for today's health epidemic.<br /><br />On April 8, 1999 representatives from Pillsbury, Kraft, Nabisco, General Mills, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Mars and Cargill met in Minneapolis to discuss the burgeoning obesity epidemic and what they should do about it.  Together these companies represented 700,000 employees and $280 billion in annual sales.  The presentation which was conducted by a representative from Kraft explicitly portrayed the obesity epidemic and why they as corporations were largely responsible and how they could now help correct it.  A well intentioned effort, however, it all came to naught because of the voice of one man, Stephen Sanger, the head of General Mills at that time.  Sanger was \\"the man\\" in those circles and no one defied him.  Thus, it was back to \\"business as usual\\" and they continued to pour billions of dollars towards the health epidemic we have today.<br /><br />Who has heard of the \\"bliss point\\"?  This is a measurement largely credited to a man named Howard Moskowitz.  Howard is the guy employed by the U.S. Army who added sugar to Meals Ready to Eat (MRE's) to make them more palatable to our service men and women.  From there Howard became a key player at General Foods and Phillip Morris and discovered the \\"bliss point\\" which is the precise amount of sugar or fat or salt that will snare the consumer.

B000F4RHB6|5.0|I missed Huey Lewis and the News when they played at our local casino. To make up for it, I purchased this CD.  Every song on it exceeded my expectations.  This CD is a must for fans of classic 80's Rock and Roll or of Huey Lewis and the News.
B007SGM084|5.0|Took me sometime but it was interesting & the suspense was over the top. It's not a culture that I have ever heard of but now I know. Very different.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great app. User friendly for any one who does not know much about about apps. Would recommend to any one
1781162646|4.0|Since others have already gone into the plot of this book I won't re-write what they've already said.  I bought this book for two reasons.<br />1. I love Stephen King<br />2. It takes place in North Carolina where I live.<br />The story does start off a little slow but gives the necessary background for the characters.  I really grew to love Devin Jones and also felt some of his heartache. After all I think most of us have felt the pain of being dumped by a 'true love'.  Some other reviewers have complained that they story moved too slowly but that's how things are during the hot North Carolina summers.  Slow and easy.  So I was okay with that.  Most of the characters are likeable.  Other's are not and they're not supposed to be.  I'm not familiar with 'carny' language but it sounded right to me.  I loved the scene where Devin flies the kite for Mike and his mom.  I was sad to see that I was almost finished with the book.  Sometimes when reading a book I can't wait for it to end.  Other times I want to shake the book to see if more of the story will fall out!  This was one of those books.  Then I reached page number 279.  I'm not a political person.  But the remark about Dick Cheney just seemed mean and out of place.  It was almost like some unknown hand had reached down and written that paragraph while Mr. King and his publisher were looking the other way.  I read books to escape from reality.  I understand that authors are real people with their own political and religious beliefs.  I don't understand why this remark was added to a mystery book that had not mentioned any politics in the previous chapters.  Instead of making me think, this paragraph instead ripped me out of the carefully woven story and pretty much ended the book for me. The magic was gone.<br />If you're looking for another \\"Cujo\\" or \\"Carrie\\" like story, you will be disappointed with this book. If you're looking for a nice, light, summer read you'll enjoy this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game was amazing and cool. It doesn't freeze or blur. It is awesome and i love it so much.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|its not installing I bought it and it did not download and is saying to install but it says there was an error downloading it
B000I186FW|4.0|I love the storyline. The acting was superb! Shows how moral extremism can be just as immoral as anarchy and hedonism
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|My son got me into Boz Skaggs years ago and am never disappointed in any of his albums. I would give this to my friends who like my kind of music.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Product was brand new. Great cover design and quality. Blu-Ray played very well-picture quality and sound are amazing! Would make a great gift, again cover design is incredible:)
B00CF34B2I|4.0|My daughter and I both have this on our kindle fires and are loving playing it. The sound and graphic are both great. Truly a joy to play.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Product was brand new. Great cover design and quality. Blu-Ray played very well-picture quality and sound are amazing! I would highly recommend this if you are a Star Wars fan. Cover design alone is incredible, would make a<br />great gift:)
0861714911|5.0|I am sure there are an infinite number of books out there on teachings of the Buddha, which are often interpretations of other people's interpretations.  This is the work of a monk who translated and organized excerpts from the Pali Canon (the huge volume of book's which are arguable directly attributed to Siddhartha Gautama, the most commonly identified &#34;Buddha&#34;).  With each section he first introduces you to what the section will talk about and he does a good job of expounding upon the information without giving it much personal coloration.  Reading compilations like this are a good stepping stone, before you begin an academic investigation into the Pali Canon.  On a personal note, the next book I am reading is &#34;Divine Revelation in Pali Buddhism&#34; a supposed academic masterpiece which earned the author a PhD.  If you are coming at this from the perspective of a hardcore academic or a self-realizer, this work may be useful too.  The style of Yoga I practice is called Surat Shabda Yoga, which roughly means, &#34;Soul uniting with the inner light and sound.&#34;  The lineage of my master's is apparently not really connected to Buddhism, so I find it fascinating that even the Buddha talks about the deathless sound.  Furthermore, this gives very profound implications for true sadhana, in that, a realizer is NECESSARY in your quest for transcendence.  This is the implication anyway and the more I research this, it seems to be the case, though I cannot speak from personal experience as I have yet to attain God-realization.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|my lil cus just loves playing this game she is just so happy that she can keep track of all her animals she loves it.
0060887303|4.0|the book was great, loved it.<br />the condition was pretty good too, no highlighting, just some bent pages and corners and some dirt on the dust cover.
0812550706|4.0|I read this years ago, when it first came out. Now that they are going to make a movie out of it, I had to refresh my memory. I am actually looking forward to their vision of the training center.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I just didn't love it. Story was trite and predictable. I was disappointed as it came highly recommended to me.  Just another teen romance.
1416955070|4.0|While I usually refrain from reading this type of book, it was very enjoyable and well written, I understand that they are making it into a movie and I seriously hope they don't do their vision of it. The book itself is well thought out and the characters are believable. I may not read the rest of the series but I can understand it popularity and just hope that if the movie being made is half a good as the book, well, they will have a serious hit on their hands.
B008Q0CO0U|5.0|I loved this show!! It gives you an idea what can happen and probably does happen more than we realize, behind the lines in the political and war fields.
B001I45UFC|4.0|I have repeatedly watch all the Narnia movies and never tire of them, now I can  also enjoy all the books as well as I have  recently purchased them for my Kindle fire. I love that those was a quick and easy read. I am following a suggested reading order recommended by another reader, so it's  on to \\"Prince Caspian\\" for  me now.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|This is one of their best albums to date! Tracks 1 through 7 were balls out rockin, AC/DC style but fresher!
0525950079|4.0|My husband bought me Pillars of the Earth & World Without End for Christmas.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading both of these books.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with Ken Follett's writing is that the sexual imagery in these books is extremely graphic. While this does not bother me in some instances, there are several instances of graphic sexual assault. Many of these scenes from both books haunted me for days after reading them. I could do without painful, graphic explanations of sexual assault.<br /><br />Follett is brilliant at bringing readers directly into his writing. In both books I felt passionately for the characters. I truly felt as if I entered their world & I could feel the pain, love, excitement, & passion of the characters.<br /><br />I am a sucker for a good love story. I love the beautiful imagery of the cathedral building. I am captivated by the suspense.<br /><br />Follett writes books that I don't want to put down. I stayed up late at night reading these 2 books. That's a good review if I have ever heard one!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app is the best weather app ever to be made. Weather live is so easy to understand. Every thing you want to know is right there in front of you.,like the temperature,the wind speed,the air pressure and etc<br />I so suggest this app for you . Enjoy.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This novel kept me guessing and pondering. I read on my kindle but quit reading at 90% to wonder how it would really end. After a week, I finished. The ending created more pondering and thinking about belief vs. disbelief and to marvel about religion and what God means in my life. So good that I a m sure to read<br />It again.<br /><br />it over and over avian. I thank Martel
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game  it's amazing to bad we couldn't get the nether or ender land<br />get that on the next update please!!!!!
B00BSZZA3I|3.0|The case looks great and good protection, wife got some new scratches on frame of front there is not perfect protection, could also be more tight to phone, i almost dropped my phone a few times. But over all i think the case is ok.
B002RKRGQ2|5.0|Funniest speech ever from Gussie - also great crosstalk with Aunt Dahlia, and good description of a cold collation, and good Anatole talk
B0015AARJI|5.0|very nice sony ps3 remote better than i thought it would be. i would recomend to buy this great product
0307990850|5.0|In my life I've read thousands (I keep records) of fiction books and lately it's been hard to find an author who does what I like.<br />Lee Child with Jack Reacher does it for me.  If you want politically correct or liberal themes, skip Child.  As for me, it's great escapism.<br />Unforunately, I read 'em all within one month - now I'm bored with Johnstone, Compton, Patterson, Clancy....<br />Norm
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have loved this series and look forward to reading more books by Sylvia Day. This book is truly one that you won't put down until you've finished.
B000I3PA8Q|4.0|I grew up with the original Star Trek and loved all the subsequent spin offs.  The new movies are even better but it is always best to go back to the original inspiration.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really love this game. I don't see how it could be any better. My granddaughter and I have a ball playing together. She likes to play the boards with me to see how many we can hit at the same time<br />  I don't know a lot about the technical stuff, but I do know that I have not had any problems with this game. I give it 4stars, only because when you run out of lives you have to wait 8 minutes for each one to regenerate, or purchase lives using actual money. I really don't like having to spend money on a free game. Other than that we love it!4 &amp; 1/2 stars. Great app.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game to hone one's process thinking skills. Doing this without writing anything down increases the challenge.  Why is word min needed?  EBay white
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is very well written by an extremely imaginative (I hope) author. A real mind twister adding up to a great read.
0060853972|5.0|I thought this tale of two angels (one good and one evil) trying to stop Armageddon from happening in an English village was hilarious. If I mention that the Four Horsemen are due to arrive on motorbikes, you may have some idea. The good angel runs a bookstore and doesn't want his life to change, and the bad angel is quite a nice guy, really, who just want to live the high life he adores.<br />Can the book containing the predictions of ancient witch Agnes Nutter save the day? And what about the instrument of this staggering event? He's a young boy with no idea that he's supposed to be responsible for the end of the world.  Either you'll have your interest piqued by this description, or it's just not your thing. Recommended for lovers of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.
1781162646|4.0|It was good. Not scary like I like from the king. Did make for a can't put the book down read.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|I agree with everybody. this is a superb serie. thrilling exciting etc..<br />but i have difficulties to understand in terms of subject and acting why Boss has been discontinued...???<br />Boss and house of card are pretty close.<br />If boss cannot fit the audience....by the subject..what about house of cards...<br />I would be tempted to say Boss is  more intense  and more powerful
B00023B1AS|5.0|I remember watching these videos during the 80's on MTV.  Great videos (and music of course) from ZZ Top.  Nice to have in one collection.
B00AQNOCZ0|4.0|No bells or whistles. The box set is all movies with their special menu discs as well. Its a good deal.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I love a good scare and this movie delivers.  The creepy music adds to the suspense.  I've heard there will be a sequel comng out later this year so I am looking forward to it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Becomes quite addicting, especially the more you play. Only issue is that the sound keeps turning it self back on.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Didn't buy this on Amazon (thank God) but got suckered by a video store poster and rented it.  So let's see: an insane and poorly shaken mixture of:<br /><br />1) medieval settings (quaint villages, witches and witch burnings),<br /><br />2) 19th century clothing, and<br /><br />3) 20th century gadgets (machine guns, six shooters, syringes, rapid fire crossbows, wristwatches, etc.), dialogue and martial arts moves. Oh, and lots of f-bombs.<br /><br />Right.  Reminds me of a similar movie, Little Red Riding Hood, with the same weird mix as above.<br /><br />Acting is OK to good, plot adequate, but I can't get past the cultural discontinuities.  I'll say that it *IS* inventive and probably entertaining, if you are historically ignorant. One of the producers is MTV, so it is probably just right for the MTV crowd.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games series is the best! I'm so glad she ended up with Peeta! (I've read the whole series at least 7 times😏)
B000MXPE7O|5.0|Wow,this is a great movie. Matt Damon in a really different role and grabs the viewer and invites us into his world where nothing is as it seems.  I have watched this movie 6 times and each time I see something I missed I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters in the movie,except Angelina Jolie shouldn't sing!  She should be Angelina!But she is great as the long suffering wife. Robert De Nero directs,and stars he  is great in anything! If you have not seen it and want a movie of intrigue,this is it!<br />Well worth the 6 times I have seen it. Perhaps I will watch it again -now!!
B005K8QIS0|3.0|Although the show was interesting, it moved a bit slowly for us and the explicit scenes detracted from our enjoyment.  After the second such scene we stopped watching.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This is a very personal account of how the master of horror Stephen King began his career as a writer. It's very entertaining with a few creepy and quirky anecdotes. It is an inspiring read for would-be writers.
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|this book is very neat and has a nice turn in the plot.i think it is like a movie the author is so disruptive
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was fun to play.it was very entertaining. the levels went from easy to hard to figure out. enjoyed it.
B000065K6N|4.0|This is a good movie however it is not for small children. It was what I wanted and it got to me in a good time.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Good action film, Malkovich is great.  Great writing, some surprises.  Can't wait for Red 2 to come out this year.
0792844890|5.0|This hilarious Star Wars Spoof by Mel Brooks is awesomely funny , it stars Rick Moranis as Darth Helmet , The late John Candy as Barth, and Mel Brooks as President Skroob /Yogurt .  When planet Spaceball has squandered it's once plentiful ,supply of oxygen . They decide to invade planet Vespa, and steal their's, the only one who can stop them is Lonestar and his right hand mawg Barth. But first they must find the wise and all-mighty Yogurt , learn to use the Schwartz , save the princess, and and save the day. This movie is a hoot , and you don't need to be a Star wars fan to enjoy it.
B001NA6096|5.0|He's so honest and skeptical and she's so vulnerable and deep! Their characters mesh well together! Can't wait to see the 3rd!
B004UFEJVW|5.0|Starts out a little depressing, but one of the few animated films these days that genuinely touch on real-life emotions.  The movie progressively gives me a warm & fuzzy feeling, and by the end you can't help but feel satisfied and thankful for what we have in our lives.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I think Day continues to show the growing relationship between Gideon and Eva. I didn't put this book down until I finished. This book in the series shows the struggles between the two that reflect from Eva's past that has been brought into their relationship and how its going to be effected. I love being able to engage in the relationship instead on it ending cold turkey. I want to continue reading more and more about Gideon and Eva. And there are so many harsh reviews that just want the series to end. Its too good of a dream relationship to end. Please realize that. That is the whole reason you read it, yes you want to know the ending but that's the drive. I love this book as well as the series.
B0090SI44M|5.0|Definitely helps out us as parents when a movie portrays 'monsters' as being goofy and lovable.  The story-line is original and is enjoyable to watch as a parent, not just something we have to sit through because our kids want to watch it.
B00DIXF0NS|5.0|Normally am a little particular about keeping things consistent and was a little apprehensive about a prequel which is somehow set in present day- but wow- the writing was great- and hats off to Mads Michelson's portrayal- produces an infectious sense of class and nobility, while literally defining ruthless
B0034G4OYK|5.0|A funny movie that my Wife and I enjoy almost as much as the kids.  It's not one of those movies that they'll watch once, and not want to watch again.
0316247545|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this book, so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a very good guidebook.  The book begins with a section describing many of the characters, including supporting characters and which episodes they appear in.  It also includes a synopsis of each episode including all of the letters written to Celestia.  There is also a complete transcriptions of the lyrics of all of the songs.<br />However, the best part of this book is the sidenotes and comments from the developers and writers.  They give a glimpse of the creative minds behind the show,and are very interesting to read.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I caught the show on tv on vacation in 2005 and fell in love with it so I ordered them
B00BJNHACS|5.0|This game is great. It is a very original concept and visually looks amazing. It can be quite difficult at times but thats what makes it fun
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I love this whole album. Usually I am disappointed when I buy a whole album maybe 3 or 4 out of 10 to 12 songs are really good. But this whole album is amazing. Awesome violin with great music and beats in the background.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Game is not too hard, so fun to play. It has everything you need to move through quickly; hint button, good help and tutorial. It has an interesting  story line and nice graphics.<br />Great :/!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|The charger case is very nice easy to use and keeps the head set from getting damaged and at the same time charges the head set without being plugged into the wall.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game trying to find another like it. Can't wait for the next one to come out. Really gets your brain working
B0046179EO|4.0|Good album do sound like the Beatles at times but still a classic album netherless. I am glad to have it in my collection.
1481207474|3.0|I don't read a lot of romance novels, I don't really know why.  This was actually a book my husband accidently purchased, and was never going to read.  I however will read pretty much anything, so he gave me the book. This was actually a really great summer read.  It was an enjoyable story, and I will probably read the others in the series.  I actually appreciated the fact that at the end of the book the author cleared up any historical inaccuracies and why she did it.  I enjoyed how it twisted and turned, and yet it was nice how everything worked out in the end.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I'm usually able to guess &#34;who done it&#34;, but this one kept me guessing. It was an effortless read, as if I was reading the script to a weekly TV show. There were no painfully long descriptions of scenary to test my patience, instead, fast action and clever dialogue. I look forward to reading the next book in this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is quite possibly the greatest thing since the color  tv and the nuclear bomb. Sweet jesus, this game is the shiz nit.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't know what was the hype of people giving bad reviews on this book. Let me tell you It was AMAZINGLY AWESOME. Gideon and Eva as always just perfect for each other. This book had me in many different emotions not only with the main characters, but also with the others in it and if you want to know Read it. Sylvia thank you for another great CrossFire novel, can't wait for book 4 for this series. I'm so happy that what I thought was gonna happen, happened in this book.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Let's just say I'm writing this review WHILE the movie is on. The book was so loosely written that I thought if I watched the movie I could understand what the book was trying to chronologically say...wrong!  The movie is just as bad if not worse. 1.)If you live in the south or are from the south the main character's voice is not convincing in ANY way. If anything it will grate on your nerves...at least until he forgets his consistency throughout the film. 2.)There's too much dialogue in it with suspense of action...but the action never really happens. The scenes just jump from one to the other without really explaining what is trying to be conveyed. 3.)Stereo typicality on muscles.<br /><br />A film that doesn't know what it is or what audience it is trying to attract. Maybe if some of these books and movies start coming up with their own original ideas they will have longevity and not get lost (or be out of the theaters) in a matter of weeks.
0345455681|5.0|I would read anything that this man writes,  It is brilliant and absorbing.  I feel at the opening lines i am having a relationship with the author as well as all the characters and history that he brings forth. Mr.  Rutherford is a brilliant writer, i cannot wait for his next book.  Knowing a little history of the incidents in this book...i was over joyed to see his attention to facts and the desire to be accurate.  I enjoyed every page and every word that he brought forth.
B007Y9BHPW|4.0|Simplicity can be quite moving and profound. This book changed my life. While reading it years ago it effected me in such away that I embarked on education so forth that I might not otherwise have done. I overcame obstacles in my life that could have seemed insurmountable. I also am a reader of good literature: Tolstoy, Dickens, Dreiser to name a few. For me it is o.k. if Coelho didn't rise to the level of Tolstoy (as another reviewer pointed out). I never even thought about it. I appreciated the book for what it was. It is a tale that inspires beautifully.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a movie that you can watch over and over again. I have seen it over and over again and just cant get enough of it!!!
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|Both my kids and I enjoy this game. I like that it has a way for us each to have our own game &quot;slot&quot; to use.
B008J4L3E6|5.0|Hooked me right from the very start I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book would recommend to any one I can't wait for the next one
B00005JPO1|3.0|It is not the best of the Indiana Jones or Harrison Ford movies but just fun to watch when you have a couple of hours to kill.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My kids and I love this game. The only problem we have had is it freezes up all the time and we have to power off the kindle and then turn it back on.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game, but over way too soon. Hopefully they will come out with many more levels. I will definitely keep playing if they do.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Please write more Hugh...you have to tell us what the humans did to the world and why?<br />What happens to Silo 17 and 18? When does the world come right? In Juliette's lifetime? Or her children's children's lifetime? How do they tell Silo 18 tell the truth and how do they run the Silo?<br />Write write write!! :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book. Usually the third book of a series I feel is not the best. However, this book was a great ending to the series....
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I think this game is awesome and the 3-d graphics are great but one small problem is  that the great white shark cost wayy a lot of coins 35000 ..so to make it awesome i wish coins  would be easier to get than just by eating fish or using real money.  BESIDES THAT THIS GAME IS TOTALLY MY GAME AN  I'M LOVING IT!!
0385535147|4.0|\\"I'm a lawyer and I'm in prison.  It's a long story.\\" What an understatement the very first sentences of this novel present.  Malcolm Bannister, Esq., jailed for unknowingly laundering money through his small \\"mom and pop\\" firm.  The Feds treated him unfairly and he has served five out of a ten year sentence in a low security jail/camp environment with plenty of time to contemplate his situation.  Lucky for him, Judge Fawcett and his hot little girlfriend are murdered and Mal begins to unravel his well thought out, albeit, complex moves on freedom and revenge.  Throughout the novel, the reader is scratching his or her head wondering where the story is going and if we can really trust Malcolm, aka, Max, to be the good guy or the bad guy.  At one point, later on in the story, I was thinking he wasn't treating our friend Nathaniel fairly (the poor guy was just trying to make something out of his sad, defeated life).  Grisham really keeps us guessing (and laughing) until the last chapter.  I was so tempted to read ahead but kept my curious mind intact and took it page by page.  Pay attention, reader, Mal/Max's plans are very intricate and require the reader's undivided attention to in order to follow the dots to his outrageously calculated final resting point.  As always, Grisham delivers and does not disappoint.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great follow up to first book. Development of characters is detailed and I like how the story is told through so many perspectives.
B00AQIZRLS|5.0|My Grandsons got ahold of this and absolutely loved it. Being Twins they wanted to be on it at the same time so we had to make an arrangement with them to swap places every so many turns. My guys love it and can't get enough of the game. Big Hit.
B009LGO88E|3.0|I purchased the Japanese import of the circle pad pro XL because I wanted to get the most out of all of my [[ASIN:B008GEH9HO Nintendo 3DS]] games (and didn't feel like waiting for US release).  Note that the circle pad pro LL/XL fits the American XL DS.  If you don't own an XL you will need the [[ASIN:B006J66CPG this one]].<br /><br />It is pretty easy to use.  It takes a single AAA battery (which it comes with), and the battery seems to last a long time.  You can unscrew the battery compartment with a key or a coin if it needs replacing.  The 3DS XL snaps into place easily.  The second circle pad is as smooth and comfortable as the first.  Most of the games that support it seem to come with calibration routines in case it doesn't seem to be working correctly (I haven't had a problem yet).  The right side includes additional right trigger buttons since you can no longer reach the right buttons, and adds a second set of triggers to both sides.<br /><br />I find the ergonomics of the device to be quite good.  It fits very comfortable in my hands, and I'll sometimes leave it on when I'm not playing compatible games.<br /><br />There are a few things that are worth noting before you purchase:<br />1. Do your research.  This only works for a few games, and does different things depending on the game.  For instance, with [[ASIN:B002I0EMBI Kid Icarus: Uprising]] it _only_ makes the game more accessible for lefties.  (I hoped that it would eliminate the need for the stylus, which it does not do).  However for [[ASIN:B009EWHKAI Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate]] (the 3DS version) it makes gameplay a lot better by eliminating the need for a virtual D-pad.  It also makes underwater fighting a lot easier.<br /><br />2. The CPP doesn't seem to be hot-swappable.  As far as I've been able to tell you have to start up the game with the CPP.  If you close your DS to put it to sleep it will sometimes complain about losing the connection (it connects with the IR port, not a hard connection).I've found if you use the CPP buttons as soon as you wake the device it will usually find it.  This means that you may have to restart your game if your DS goes to sleep and doesn't recognize the CPP or if you need to take it off and put it back on (see #3).<br /><br />3. I find it quite surprising that the unit completely blocks the stylus and doesn't provide an alternate stylus.  This seems like a poor design choice.  The CPP has enough girth that I suspect there is room for another stylus port in the device, but it doesn't provide one.  If Nintendo happens to be listening this would be clear way to improve the device.<br /><br />If it included a second stylus port I would give at least four stars, but this omission seriously detracts from the design/playability.<br /><br />Related to point 1 I also wish that more game designers (Nintendo included) would have focused on making the games enhanced or at least compatible with the CPP.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|This book will show you that itvis in everyone's best interest to be a givers!  Imagine a world like that!  It has compelling examples of all the behaviors described.  And incredible actions all of us can take.  This book is a must read!

B009AMAGQM|3.0|The long and short of it is if you read the book, you probably won't be too happy with the movie. If you didn't read the book, you probably thought the movie was great. I'm in the first group. The movie isn't horrible but the books are just so much more nuanced. The movie leaves a lot out and for those not familiar with the story, they aren't really going to catch all the clues and in the end, the \\"big reveal\\" where one finds out Lena's fate, well, all I have to say is don't blink. You get one quick look at that's it. And when Ethan rides off in the sunset, the movie really doesn't explain why he remembers or if he does. And the movie really never explains what Ethan's \\"power\\" is.<br /><br />The problem basically is that the movie has no depth. You don't get the backstory or really learn what motivates certain characters (e.g. Macon)<br /><br />I think the reason there are so many loose ends in this movie is because 1) the director expects the movie goers to have already read the book and 2) he is trying to set it up for a sequel which may be in doubt since I don't think it did well in the theatres.<br /><br />Again, I liked it. It isn't horrible but it just kind of leaves you hanging.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Great movie.... I could have expected less from these actors... The plot was very interesting... I don't want to give it away...
B002MG2ATY|4.0|This is a movie that every American should see. It reinforces that democracy needs to be open and transparent to be of the people for the people. The cover up of the conspiracy is a lesson for all generations - power corrupts and total power corrupts absolutely.  The beginning of the film has Ike saying in 59 or 60 beware of the growth of the unprecedented industrial - military complex! Hard to believe that the former supreme commander in WW II would say that. Also instructive is the English documentary called The Men Who Killed Kennedy - the key word being &#34;men&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely love this game! It's the best! I downloaded it for my cousin and I have played it more than he has.

0802473156|5.0|five languages, that you and your partner each fall into. It specifies only that one language is the dominant one in your personality. My boyfriend didn't agree. He thought that he was a blend. As I did too, but as things in life go on, you will end up finding the dominant language for each person.<br />However, he had me figured out after reading it, and it is really amazing, how once you know something it is so much easier to address and act on it. I really enjoyed reading this, and think that there would be much happier relationships out there if people saw how easy it is to just pay attention to what is going on with the other person, to really give them what they need in a relationship. This book  breaks it down and shows you how to do just that.  It is amazing to see how people respond once you know their language. I liked how it was worded and the examples of the couples that he talks about. It is not just limited to couples. It can be applied to everyone in your life.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|This season amazingly reintroduced many concepts from the classic series (the Doctor, the TARDIS, UNIT (sort of), Daleks, and Regeneration). Despite being only the Doctor for one season, Christopher Eccleston left an impact as the Doctor who brought the show back from a 16 year (9 year if you count the TV movie). Although Rose had a few good moments (and one good episode), she unfortunately came across as selfish, and is on my opinion one of the weaker companions of the show. Don't get me wrong, Billie Piper is a good actress, but the writers loved her TOO MUCH! Here are my thoughts on all 13 episodes (SPOILERS!):<br /><br />Rose: Great start, especially on bringing back the Autons!<br /><br />End of the World: Good futuristic look at the Earth's End (just get the fast forward button when &#34;Toxic&#34; plays)<br /><br />The Unquiet Dead: Creepy, yet fun romp with Charles Dickens!<br /><br />Aliens of London/World War Three: Flawed, but entertaining invasion story.<br /><br />Dalek: Successful re-introduction of the Doctor's most iconic enemy.<br /><br />The Long Game: The weakest episode of the season, but is saved by Simon Pegg's dark sense of humor.<br /><br />Father's Day: Rose's finest hour.<br /><br />The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances: Hands down, the scariest, yet the best story of the whole season!<br /><br />Boom Town: Interesting ideas, but rushed plot.<br /><br />Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways: Fantastic finale and has one of the best send-offs from any Doctor (better than End of Time, but can't top Caves of Androzani).
B0046RE5HW|4.0|Although this book is a little slow to start (like most Agatha Christie novels), it proves to be an excellent book with a most amazing twist. The thing I love about this book and book from this author is that they can be read my anyone who doesn't mind a little bit of old-fashioned language. It is a must-read by all those enthralled by murder mysteries and I am not going to be digitally shelving this one for a long time!
B008QE9XD2|3.0|The movie was even more ridiculous than I thought; though of course that's not the dvd's fault nor Amazon's, I knew not to expect much from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, and a movie based on a TV series that is supposed to be gothic horror being labeled as hilariously funny was bound to be dumb... and it was. I would have enjoyed this much better had they played it straight rather than go for cheap laughs; so might other people have. Movies that remake serious programs as comedies fail more other than not (Land of the lost and dragnet both come to mind); this was no exception.<br />Once I began ignoring my memories of the REAL Dark Shadows though; this was okay. Not great, but okay.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I thought the ww2 gun app was really good It was good for them to include weapons from both sides of the war and I hope they add more in an update
B000AOEMXM|4.0|Originally I disliked this show so much i stopped watching it midway through its first season, but apparently it improved a lot afterward, and now i'm sorry it stopped when it was really going places. Some episodes are real clunkers, as is true of every Star trek series, and i'm still not terribly fond of Scott Bakula but that's just personal taste. All in all the series was much better than I'd remembered and all the DVDs were in prime condition.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I heard David Gaughran on the Self Publishing Podcast, and it was clear he knew his stuff. So I bought Let's Get Digital for my Kindle. Of the many dozens of self-published ebooks on technology topics I've read, this is one of the best. Gaughran starts out explaining the world of conventional publishing, by way of telling why a writer should self-publish. Readers who are already sold on self-publishing might be tempted to skip this part, but I recommend reading it. It's clear & succinct, and gives a lot of insight into the world which even the self-publisher is entering.<br /><br />Then, in part 2, he gets down to the nuts and bolts of how to write and publish. The book is very Amazon-centric, but that's because Amazon is by far the widest doorway to self-publishing opportunity.<br /><br />Gaughran also covers the basics of how to publicize your work--blogs, social media, etc. This part is pretty cursory, but he's written another entire book on increasing your work's visibility.<br /><br />All this would have gotten the book four stars. But what makes it worthy of that fifth star is that Gaughran is not simply smart but wise. He knows that the work of a writer is to write, and warns in clear and trenchant terms of the dangers of distraction. As he puts it, \\"the most effective marketing tool for any writer is new work.\\"<br /><br />Well said.

B00A8MGIZG|3.0|Cloud Atlas is a good film that could have been a great film if it had not been so confusing and inconsistent. Allow me to elaborate further. The film did have MANY positive, appealing aspects to it, it was visually stunning, had many rich and interesting characters, both good and bad, as well as very strong spiritual themes such as reincarnation and the belief that there is a bond that connects us all. However, the fact that it kept switching back and forth, changing characters, style of dialogue, and even tone (some stories were more humorous or dramatic than others), it almost felt like I was watching six separate movies instead of one cohesive one. I understand that all of the stories are connected and feature the same actors/actresses so it's obviously meant to be just one film, the settings and tones, as previously mentioned, were so diverse and different that I still had trouble connecting them to the other stories. One story, the 19th century one, felt like a historical adventure film a la Pirates of the Caribbean, The story that takes place in the far future, with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry meeting up in a setting which oddly reminded me of Battlestar Galactica, seems like a Sci-Fi epic similar to Avatar or Star Wars and the story that takes place in modern times seems like something Guy Ritchie or Shane Meadows would direct. It was all very inconsistent and very unnecessary. However, I greatly did enjoy all of the actors playing such wildly different characters, especially Tom Hanks, who plays both very villainous and very heroic roles, demonstrating how he eventually redeems himself of his past sins and negative karma. I have heard this film described as a very \\"Buddhist\\" film and I certainly agree, many of the central themes of Buddhism such as karma, reincarnation, dharma, and samsara. I feel that there aren't enough films of this sort being made nowadays and I greatly enjoyed watching it. Cloud Atlas is no masterpiece, at least in my view, but neither is it pretentious or overwrought, it's just an enjoyable film which I'm glad I managed to watch in all it's roughly 3 hour running time. Thank you and have a nice day.s it pretentious or overwrought, it's just an enjoyable film which I'm glad I managed to watch in all it's roughly 3 hour running time. Thank you and have a nice day.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|This album is filled with dark religious introspection, like Master of Reality but with less optimism. After listening to it I was left feeling uneasy about the future. This album really captures the pessimism that is going on now perfectly.<br /><br />Don't judge this album by one listening, you have to hear it a few times for it to sink in. At first the riffs don't seem as strong or as catchy as they were in the recent Dio material but they grow on you and put you in a mood.<br /><br />Kudos to Rick Rubin for several reasons: he captured the vibe of the earlier albums perfectly but still managed to make the music sound up to date, he put Iommi's guitar up front and center in the mix and unlike most of the Sabbath albums the guitar solos really ring out clearly and Iommi really plays well with short but intense leads. Why are people complaining about the production? The album sounds great!
B007V65R54|5.0|If there is one single huge gap in understanding math it's probability and statistics. We are deluged with forecasts of nearly everything. But how do we forecast? What can we forecast? What is the uncertainty in a forecast? Silver addresses these questions, in detail, using baseball, weather, earthquakes, terrorist events and the stock market as detailed examples. Why can we do a pretty good job with baseball? Why are weather forecasts getting better? Why is predicting terrorist attacks more like predicting earthquakes than weather? You can't predict either earthquakes or terrorist attacks, only that they will happen not when. He also explains Bayesian statistics in as simple a manner as I believe is possible. If you are interested in these questions then this book is for you.

1439152802|1.0|How did this book ever get published? The first chapter is supposed to grab the commissioning editor. He must have been a push-over. I used to write like this when I was ten.<br />Let's see, we need an address in London. Close my eyes and see what jumps into my mind. Rillington Place! Well, I never. Any author worth her salt would have thrown that one out immediately.<br />The reader doesn't have to do any work to read this book, except perhaps prop her eyelid open. The didactic author tells you exactly what to think. Omnipresent and authoritative; you WILL share  her point of view, even if it is so far-fetched that it strains your credulity.<br />You only need to be able to add up to guess one of the plot twists.<br />Too many adjectives and adverbs. Don't go thinking for yourself now.The passive voice is very tiresome.<br />The author gives us information which the protagonist didn't have. So it's a miracle that Laurel (is that a name?) managed to work it out.<br />And would you really spend your mother's last days dashing around the country doing 'research' into her past.<br />I was amused by the doctor though, giving the relatives bad news over lunch. What a quaint view of the NHS.<br />Tress were unnecessarily sacrificed to print this book.

1781162646|5.0|&#34;Joy land&#34; is a thrill ride of a book. King wrote this book in the style of similar books by the publisher, Hard Case Books. King said in an interview on Sunday Morning on CBS that he had fun writing the book. &#34; Joyland&#34; takes place in a small amusement park in North Carolina where the narrator is employed one summer. The narrator took the job in order to forget a bad breakup. This book will make keep you on the edge of your seat, make you smile and maybe get a lump in your throat.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I can't imagine a day at work without this app. You can customize the \\"melodies\\" to create the perfect layers of white noise to block out whatever sounds are happening in the office. I'm a fan of a couple types of rain (on the tin roof, in the distance) with a waterfall for depth/background noise and wind chimes for harmony. I can't recommend this app enough for everyone, and ESPECIALLY anyone who needs to block out stimulation to function on a daily basis. Essential for those of us with ADHD!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|When I saw this was hitting android I went and purchased it instantly. Does not disappoint. Played the console versions of this the past couple year wishing I could play it on my phone or tablet instead.
0785156593|2.0|I had of course heard of this story by the talented Jim Starlin. I enjoy stories with multiple characters and certainly sweeping, grand scope space sagas but after reading the \\"Infinity Gauntlet\\" I thought it to be very disappointing. I compare it to the film \\"Avatar\\" -- big epic story with all the bells and whistles, but just doesn't deliver.<br /><br />I think Thanos is a wonderful character and I have enjoyed reading numerous stories involving him in the Silver Surfer title. I also too like the Adam Warlock character and in this book I had a feeling that it would most likely be one of the other-world beings that would find the Mad Titan's weak spot and ultimately defeat him. But though the story starts out with a full head of steam, it putters out pretty quickly once the actual battle begins (if you can even call it a real battle)<br /><br />All of Marvel Universe is brought in to take down Thanos after he has acquired the all-powerful Infinity Gauntlet and the story is at its weakest at this point, as the plot essentially gathers all the heroes together and in one massive task force, throws them all in and at Thanos, where he just sweeps them away, one by one like as many frames in a game of bowling.<br /><br />The story has its moments - the scene with Captain America being one that stands out but overall it makes for a lackluster read when your lead character wipes out everybody with no real challenge to offer some real drama and excitement. The Warlock character seems to know something that no one else does, keeps his allies and the reader in suspense throughout the entire story and finally at the end, slaps the final \\"check mate\\" on Thanos but the final play is mild and uninspiring to say the least.<br /><br />I have read better stories involving Thanos and this one was undoubtedly designed to showcase the character in his ultimate devilish element, but this story just doesn't live up to the hype.

For anyone who listens to good, meaningful music wont find anything of meaning here just talentless humans trying to use tired issues to depress people into album sales.....
B00AGYM0DU|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel, which takes a twist on the 'correspondence genre' wherein two people get to know one another through their letters. The difference in 'A Tale for the Time Being' is that the two people never actually meet or even correspond with each other directly. Ruth, a middle-aged novelist, finds the diary of a young Japanese girl, Nao, washed up on the shores on a remote Island in British Columbia.<br />Despite her youth, Nao cannot see the point of living anymore. She is bullied mercilessly; she feels she doesn't fit in; her father himself is suicidal after he was made redundant in the USA and had to return to a life of relative poverty in Japan. However, before she commits suicide Nao decides to commit herself first to writing down the story of her great grandmother who is a Zen Buddist. Through her writing, Ruth gets to know and care for Nao, just as Nao comes to relate to and trust her anonymous reader.<br />This novel travels between past and present, East and West, mysticism and realism, age and youth. It was a refreshing change in the trends of modern literature. Highly recommended.

B00COHAUD4|5.0|It was weird seeing Mama throughout the movie and having her still freak you out all the way till the end. The reasoning for her existing was great too. It wasn't complicated but enough for her to do what she did. Suspenseful and a Thriller. Richie Cunningham did good by his daughter too. She's a very good actor.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Watched this in an extreme state of boredom. Was bothered by yellow face and Tom hanks ebonics, and that's the true true. If you're really bored, it's a decent way to pass the time. The music was really good hence more than one star.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie made me like Jamie Fox as an actor. Up until this movie I only liked his Wanda character. Maybe his Jarhead character. There's a lot of casual cursing, bloody violence and action. Everybody in it played their part to a T. Just when you think Samuel's gonna do another &#34;I SAAAID!!!&#34; kind of preformance he surprises me again.Samuel Jackson impresses everytime. Will buy Blu-Ray for sure.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I could not put this one down; Nelson DeMille gets better and better............so does his character, John Corey!  I bought this one for my Kindle, then gifted it to my son and to my brother, who all enjoy Demille like I do.  As usual, the story's suspense and action remain unparalleled; John Corey's  banter, whether to another person or in his own mind, entertain to the point of laughing out loud!  Just great stuff!
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|What a build up for no return. The whole movie was more focused on the 2 unknowns telling each other I love you then focusing on the real story of the creatures themselves. They made it sound like this would be  show-down of the good vs. evil witches but wa-wa , don't think so. They also had 2 GREAT actors, Emma Thompson and Jeremy Irons and gave them practically no lines. With the story so weak they should have had them carry the movie. The director must've been 20 years old and not know what he had.Ugh.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun to play. Can't wait for additional rooms! Not too easy but not too difficult. One of my favorites.

B009UNGYHG|5.0|This case serves storage/protection and charging needs. I rarely use car charger since purchasing the case. Great accessory to have. Worth the cost.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome  game i love subway surfers it really makes you think about what to do and when to do it.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|My granddaughter played this for an hour at a time until I had to take my kindle away from her.  My grandson also played this game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My fiancé and I literally couldn't pull ourselves away from this season!! We paused only to take breaks so we wouldn't feel too lazy..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My granddaughter picked up this game easily.  She offered to teach me how to play.  I did observe her playing and she enjoyed playing the game.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My brother has an I pod and I saw him playing this game.I searched the app store for it and they didn't have it.Then one day I saw it! finaly!!! this game is the beat!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|the average game. great to play in spare time or when there is nothing else to do. download this app.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|First a little background: In 2007, a couple of audacious film writers, Quentin Tarantino (\\"Pulp Fiction\\") and Robert Rodriguez (\\"Sin City\\"), wrote two feature-length horror films linked by fake trailers, all three presented as \\"Grindhouse.\\" Fanboys went NUTS! Plus they started begging for one of the spoofs featured in the trailers!<br /><br />Thus was \\"Machete\\" born.<br /><br />This blood-splattered (but humor-laced) potboiler illustrates the far-reaching tentacles of the drug cartels south of the border and the political chicanery to the north. Our story centers on one muy feo hombre whose weapon of choice is...you guessed it...a machete; all that blowie uppie stuff is for sissies! He is a former Mexican Federale who is now an illegal alien, just trying to get work as a laborer.<br /><br />  * Former real-life felon Danny Trejo (\\"Dark Games\\") plays our very ugly fellow, a tragedy-scarred loner, a man of few words who prefers low-tech weaponry.<br />  * Former action star Steven Seagal (TV's \\"Southern Justice\\") is the brutal jefe honcho of the Mexican cartel.<br />  * Former tabloid queen Lindsay Lohan (\\"Mean Girls\\") is the messed-up daughter of a political functionary.<br />  * Former marijuana front man Cheech Marin (\\"The Perfect Game\\") is Machete's brother turned priest.<br />  * Former heartthrob Don Johnson (\\"When in Rome\\") is a lawman, a stogie-smokin' Good Ol' Boy.<br />  * Jeff Fahey (LOTS of TV) brings plenty of blue-eyed charm to his role as a political strategist.<br />  * Robert De Niro (\\"Meet the Fockers\\") is a racist state senator running for reelection on an anti-immigrant platform.<br />  * Jessica Alba (\\"Little Fockers\\") wears spike heels as a hard-working DEA agent! (Her hair looks sooo clean.)<br />  * Michelle Rodriguez (\\"Avatar\\") runs a taco stand out of a van. She darn near steals the show.<br /><br />By the way, those two females pass the Bechdel Test, i.e., their characters have names and their conversations are NOT about a man, but insteadabout the problems of immigration and corrupt governments. Kudos to the writers. That being said, this is an over-the-top, highly exaggerated view of the immigration problem. The bloodshed and the betrayals however, are probably right on the money.<br /><br />You'll either love it or you'll hate it. I love my DVD from Amazon.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I promise you the only reason I finished this book was because I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. I was at the 45% finished mark before anything even remotely interesting occurred. The further along I got I wondered why she even bothered to write this book and the ending was THE WORST EVER!!!  There is no way I will read another installment of this series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|as they say all good things must come to an end. Super sad face. Great ride while it lasted tho.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A lot of fun. Not too hard, not too easy. Would pay for  more levels. The last level stumped me for a while. Played on Kindle Fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|loved everything about this book, i think its my favorite of the series, so hard to decide tho. If you haven't read, definitely do!
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|Very funny. I'm not a Ben Stiller fan but this is one of the few of his movies I've liked.<br />Really good family entertainment.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Dexter is the best show, period. Great acting, writing, directing and it keeps you going season after season. Looking forward to this upcoming, last season!
0345803485|1.0|This is undoubtedly some of the worst writing I have ever endured. The only point of reference that I can use fairly as a comparison would be the draft essays that my procrastinating son carelessly produced in a rush at the 11th hour -- when he was in the 6th grade! No pun intended but someone should bind, gag and spank the aspiring \\"author\\" of this document that some are inappropriately referring to as a book.<br /><br />Ms. James should immediately invest in a thesaurus.  She literally uses the terms: flush, dryly, mutter, murmur, crap, jeez and inner goddess hundreds of times. In many instances she torments you with her limited vocabulary by repeating the same words and phrases multiple times in the same paragraph -- in back to back sentences.  Her writing is more repetitive than the incessant beat of a trance inducing, electronica club song.<br /><br />And what about the much hyped erotic content? Sorry, I had to stop and regain my composure as the rhetorical question I just posed sent me crashing to the floor in hysterical laughter.<br /><br />The writer's attempt at developing sensual content was a huge fail and not sexy. It wasn't really kinky either but rather predictable and boring. I really pity the person who gets turned on by this book. It is a damning confirmation sign that the person has not been getting enough good poo-nan-ney.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks this is a great literary work should be banished to a hard-core,  12-month creative, writing clinic followed by a sentence of 6 months in a college library archives program (no reduction in time served due to good behavior allowed).
B006N0YWGY|3.0|I like the concept but it is so difficult that it is frustrating. The speed is too fast, the courses have too many curves and obstacles. The ramps are impossible how they are placed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|there diamonds other kinds of ores mobs and blocks I have fun playing with my freinds an building houses on creaetive and survail I love it thanks to notch for makeing Minecraft-Pocket Edition thanks for havering new updates
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Twists & turns, Twists & turns!  Just love this as one of Jack Reachers finest mind benders.  I would recommend this to all!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Carole king and James Taylor  again just as I remembered.  The words are timeless and you will have great memories.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|This is a pretty good movie. it is basically like just watching the game. i love the game so much that's why i like this movie so much and it is only like the second or third lego movie made. i hope they do another one. i think they did a great job with the animation. so if you liked the game then you'll like this movie. it is very original and it is cool to see all those other DC heroes and villians in a lego movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have read all of the books in this series, and have loved each one of them.  The Heart of Obsidian is a great addition to this series.<br />I don't like to tell much about the story line in a review, but this book does explain quite a bit about the Psy, the Arrow squad, and the silence.  Each book speaks of silence but this book shows you when a strong Psy breaks silence how hard it really is to do.<br />The two main characters are very likeable.  Kaleb has been in many of the other books, and was always the man of mystery.  If you have read the other books in the series you will have had your ideas where he would fit in, and must have known that this would be his story once you heard the title of this book.  You will love Sarah, and be very happy for her as she heals and regains her strength.  Of course the love that grows between them is a cause for celebration.<br />This book will leave you wondering how things are going to work out for the Psy as a race, will they make it or not.  You are sure that the stronger Psy will, but what part the Arrows, Kaleb, and the Changlings have in the new world.<br />Thank you for a great story, I loved it.
B00785P2QC|2.0|I'm so tired of games that say &#34;Hey, here's a great idea and a generally fun concept made into a decent game.&#34; Then you play it. Sure, its fun, but I am tired of games that require you to either wait long period of time to gain the materials you need (and I mean days to weeks just to increase the area you can use) or you have to spend money. Can I not just download a game and play it?
1442346949|3.0|I ordered the Audio CD because I heard that the book was good.  I saw nowhere on the description that it was abridged.  Abridged books are usually not worth listening to.  Too much is left out of the story.
B008602KQI|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a very long while. Entertaining from start to finish.  Great acting, great story line, very suspenseful.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After all the hype and watching the first movie I found the trilogy for a bargain basement price and decided to see what \\"the games\\" were all about.  I started into the first book and couldn't stop.  I HAD to find out what was going to happen next.  Strange, since reading the books gave me an uneasy feeling...the themes being explored were so often dark, the action dark.  But what great descriptive writing, and the moral issues explored were very thought provoking.  If you want fluffy feel-good stories, take a pass.  If you're up for something different that may make you think harder about what is happening in the world, dive in!
B000JG9ZXI|4.0|Great movie, Hitchcock at his best in regards to mystery and intrigue. The actor in this movie is not over done, it is a great movie just because of that.
B006ON7XRK|4.0|This book is pretty funny, very irreverent and quick to read. It is not a guide to grammar, vocabulary, sentence construction, verb usage, nouns, adjectives, etc., instead it touches on the very fundamentals of grammatical errors. Mistakes in the proper use of the apostrophe and the comma seem to be the ones that ticked off the author the most, and she spends a large portion of the book addressing the issue, in a very humorous way. Later in the book she discusses other grammatical errors, mainly the other punctuation signs.<br />Overall the book has lots of information albeit trivial. Again, it is a quick educational book and it is very funny.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The writing is so very well done, so descriptive, colorful, and gripping to keep your attention.  This book is a continuation of book 1, but is very different and teaches so much about the Caster world and its many characters.  The emotional aspect is in place even more so and involving new characters in dramatic ways.  This story takes you out of your own element, away from everything and fills your mind with amazing possibilities, and leaves you craving for more.  That's amazing authors doing it right.  I highly recommend this series thus far and am going directly to book three.  Do what I did, go on faith, download all 4 books at the start.
0062511408|5.0|I absolutely loved it! I have to say this was the very first book I read from Paulo Coelho (inmediately followed with ELEVEN MINUTES, VERONIKA DECIDES TO DIE.....). It turned a light inside me, made me dream big again. Loved how the main character as young as him kept on going and never stop to search for his dream no matter the obstacles.
B00632HWOG|1.0|It erased all of my emails and I hate it so much it is so stupid it makes me want to scream
B00080Z53O|5.0|Excellent story but,as it is a foreign film, be prepared for subtitles. Anyone who is interested in the right to die/responsibility to live controversy, no matter which side of the fence they sit on, I believe will fine the unfortunate story insightful. A very good movie that brings in all aspects of the issue.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a fun app.  I really enjoy how it makes you think. I've really enjoyed it. you should.get it
068485743X|5.0|Noah is very candid, incredibly knowledgeable, and presents his views in an organized way. I carry it with me everywhere to read during moments while I have to wait. I learned so many things and hope that my lessons from this book will be reflected in my upcoming Memoir. Noah not only teaches but also lays out the reasons why his opinions fall they way that they do. Making sense is &#34;Priceless!&#34;
0345529057|5.0|These books are worth all the hype and the great reviews. The story is amazing as well as the cast of characters. You never know what is going to happen from day to day or who is going to die or rise to the top. It will take your emotions on a roller coaster ride. This author can be brutal at times, but it does not distract from the story. This is some of the best fantasy fiction I have ever read. I bought the four book paperback set because it was cheaper, even though I really wanted the Kindle e-books. Still can't understand why the Kindle versions costs more.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Bought this movie for the 2nd time, lost my first copy during a move.. my teenage daughter loves it also
B00006LLLN|5.0|Their music is so uplifting.  I love it. The musicians are all superb individually, and together the music is  superb.
B00AFEY354|5.0|great movie.. Bought for my daughter.. We watched it together  and watched it again, and again , and again,  etc.. Bought the Soundtrack also...
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I am so glad I downloaded this instead of minecraft  I like it. A lot.<br />You should download it instead of minecraft.
B000R019J4|4.0|So happy to add this cd to my Mick Hucknall collection!  Please keep 'em coming and we'll keep buying them!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|When she's on, she's completely on (such as the hilarious, unique-perspective photo shoot chapter), but other sections (especially her early history) are seriously boring. I kept on reading because I love what Tina Fey has accomplished and represents. Overall, it's a &#34;why not?&#34; read,.
B00BQ1DATU|5.0|The electro-folk sound on \\"Junip\\" has me craving for more after the record ends.  And then I find myself listening to this record again and again.<br /><br />You wouldn't know it, but it truly is a must own, and you'll be highly satisfied as long as you have an open-mind about various sounds and styles of music.<br /><br />Some may call it a masterpiece.  And after a few more listens, I may call it just that.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B005T87QCI|5.0|I saw someone else playing it so I ordered it for my Kindle.  Love it.  It's so fun.  I would recommend it.
B000QRIGJY|3.0|I have read most of Michael Connelly's books and enjoyed most of them. In my opinion, The Overlook wasn't as interesting as his usual stories..  Harry Bosch is such a colorful character and has become a little boring.  Maybe it's time for him to retire.
0307887448|5.0|A coworker recommended I read this, and I'm glad she did. Cline did an excellent job of incorporating 80's pop culture into a modern setting. I also felt elements of .hack in his story. There were a few instances of predictability, but I didn't mind them, because the character interactions held my attention. Also, Sorrento seemed a little too flat. Overall, it was a great book. I highly recommend it.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|What can you say? This is an absolute classic, I watch it over and over and over.  I loaned it out and never got it back so this purchase was a replacement ... can't be without it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the awesomest game ever I love it it's my favorite game I love horses and all kinds of animals but mostly horses
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Old school action film-- classic Ah-noldt.  Bang bang, fast cars, kick butt, seasoned with a few wisecracks. Good fun if you expect no more and no less.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for more. It kept me thinking and engaged. This is a great exercise for the mind. More seniors should try this challenge.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The second season is as awesome as the first.  It really picks up.  New characters are introduced.  The villains are just as fascinating as Sherlock and Watson.  The ending was very unexpected, and I can't wait to see the outcome in season three.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I missed the series when it was on TV so I have been watching it on my Kindle. It is so good I have to force myself to watch only 1 or 2 episodes at a time. I watched the whole first series in two days so I had to pace myself for the other ones. I would recommend  it any one interested in history and how people lived in the past, although women will probably enjoy it more than men because it is full of drama.
B00847KFDS|4.0|interesting adaptation on Fogerty classics, a couple of them don;t measure up.<br />I am glad John is still active and this is an ok way for him to get paid
0385341008|4.0|I read this book some time ago and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The story takes place in part on Guernsey - an island I knew little about.  After reading the story I want to visit.  It prompted me to check out Guernsey and nearby islands on the Internet.<br /><br />With the sheer volume of books about World War II this was a humorous, touching, intimate story about the impact of the War on a little-known part of the world.<br /><br />Worth reading!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|the 2 cd album is great.  all their great hits are there<br />they have put most of the non-great songs together whch makes it easier to navigate
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game is a good suspenseful one with plenty of the hidden objects aspect. also i like the detective portion of the story.
