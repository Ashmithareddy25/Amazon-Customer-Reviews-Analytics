0743289412|1.0|As a long time reader of King novels this is one of worest books i have ever tried to read, I never did get finished, and by the time I put it down, didn't even care that I don't know how it ends.
B0007WYFHU|5.0|The beautiful poetic style of this book hooked me. Craving that moment each chapter where something simple in life is described beautifully. I loved the way the plot was organized. I love that it is based on historical events. Characters are complex. I didn't ask much - I enjoyed the beautiful descriptions of life, the raising of societal themes, and a plot that kept me going. The characters stay strong in my mind and I feel blessed to have read about these characters and have their stories in my minds eye.
B000002UY5|5.0|I bought it when it came out.  I bought 'Soup' when that came out, and then I bought 'Nico' when that arrived, as well. <br /> <br />Well, it's 15 years later, and now I can't listen to this album.  I can't listen to Nico, and while I can occasionally get up to put on Soup, this one gathers the most dust.  To call it a solid album is an understatement.  To come to terms with it is impossible.  I've worn it out and repurchased it probably five times?  I even stole my sister's copy.   <br /> <br />The songwriting and playing is brutally personal and honest to the point where it frightens me.  I get emotionally upset when people bring up the band, the singer, or the songs.    <br /> <br />Capitol pressed so many copies that you can buy it here for $.99, and if you ever thought Seward got a good deal...
B00000J2PH|5.0|I couldn't live (\\"Way Over Yonder\\") without Carole King's \\"Tapestry\\" being close by me (after being \\"So Far Away\\").  It has been placed into my iPod (where it is \\"Home Again\\") because it is a classic.  For me (\\"Smackwater Jack\\") , EVERY song has a special memory (when they play, \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\") attached to it. If a person wanted to have a Greatest Hits of Carole King, this would be sufficient.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Or couldn't, seeing as how it was sent to an early death by idiot studio execs.  Still, the best piece of TV and Sci-Fi that never quite made it big until it was too late.  Everyone should see this show. <br /> <br />
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Arrived in excellent condition and in a timely  manner.  Thank you very much.
B00005JPCD|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen. All my friends loved it so I said to myself, it's probaly a cute movie, let's go see it. Boy was I wrong. First off, it starts off weird. The songs are completely inappropriate for the kids who watch this. Every other second the penguins start singing. The seconds they're not, they talk about how hungry they are. (News flash: penguins aren't endagered.) But what really bothered me was how political it was. They get the parents in there with there kids and then they force this message on them that humans are destroying penguins! And I will admit, I'm a tree-hugger. But this movie was uncalled for.
B00000DR52|5.0|This is Ryuichi Sakamoto at his best. I must confess that I never play the David Byrne tracks. They're just not in the same league.
B00005JOLI|4.0|I am an avid fan of the books. I've read Eragon 3 times and Eldest twice. The movie, I will admit, was a disappointment. But as far as movies go, it was still good. You can't expect it to be just like the books. We'd all be in there for days if it were. But the special effects were phenomenal, ecspecially Saphira. And all the roles were well cast. With this file, don't judge a movie by the bad reviews. Give it a chance. My family loved it and they'd never read the books.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|This product is cheaply made therefore it's overpriced.  The Swivel Sweeper infomercial offers free \\"RUSH\\" delivery.   It's a good thing it does, because my rush delivery took more than three weeks to reach my home address.  <br />   I wish the best of luck to new owners.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|(I found this CD to be in quality condition with no injuries upon delivery.) <br /> <br />As for the CD overall, I saw this band before they became mainstream and loved them, so when I saw this CD at such a cheap price, I had to buy it. The Arcade Fire is a unique band with a variety of songs. Some of their pieces are eerie and soft, where others are up-beat and fun. I would suggest this CD to someone who is looking for a change from their average choice of music to serve as something to lessen the drastic change. The Arcade Fire is very agreeable music.
B00078XGRO|5.0|Delivery was prompt and in very good condition. I would buy from this vendor again with pleasure.
B000KRNCYY|4.0|I really like this CD. It doesn't have any really \\"new\\" sounds relative to their other CD but then I guess you expect \\"traditional sounds\\" from Celtic Women. All have beautiful voices and the album is a good listen for fans of the genre.
0552151769|5.0|I Love this book. It is quick paced and Brown always leaves you wondering what will happen in the next chapter.  I couldn't put it down!!!!
B000KCHZK6|4.0|If you're a Nora Jones fan, you'll undoubtedly like this CD. I greatly admire anyone who has the talent to not only sing with such style but write their own material as well. Good for her!
B00005LC1H|5.0|If you like Mr. Bean, Blackadder, The Thin Blue Line or Are you Being Served, you will probably enjoy Fawlty Towers. I had never heard of it until Amazon recommended it for me based on my love of 'The Thin Blue Line'.<br /><br />Anyway, John Cleese plays Basil a very hen pecked, overworked and kind of antisocial but good guy. His wife is always talking on the phone and talking the guests ears off.  The supporting cast is excellent as well. My favorite episode is 'The Germans'. I watch these 12 episodes over and over. So very hilarious!

0375505091|5.0|I'd never been much for Ms. Leibovitz's celebrity portraits, although she is a great artist and they are technically superb.  I confess I got this book strictly because I knew it was a collection of her personal work and specifically documentation of her loved ones' suffering and death. <br /> <br />Everybody should see these photographs before they die.  I don't think anyone has depicted youth, age, illness and one's exit from the planet more starkly or more passionately. <br /> <br />Even though Ms. Sontag did not die of a preventable cancer, seeing some of these photographs next to the cigarette cartons at the supermarket or a little ways off from the ground beef case might do more than all the tut-tutting in the world from well-meaning elders to younger folks who think they can live forever. <br /> <br />The photographs are not, as one other reviewer suggested, a downer.  They are a fervent plea to be aware of the ephemeral nature of life, and to not only seize the day, but to drag it kicking and screaming from the room. <br /> <br />They are the best work that Ms. Leibovitz has ever done, and they are those for which she will be remembered. <br />
0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas is one of the best books I've ever read. I was a little worried it'd be so wrapped up in its literary experimentation that it wouldn't be readable, but I was wrong. Mitchell manages both perfectly. The novel had me equally fascinated with the great stories and the completely brilliant writing.<br /><br />The novel began with the journal of a man traveling near Australia via ship in the 19th century. Although none of this sounds like something I'd enjoy (19th century, ship voyage, journal entries), David Mitchell manages to mirror a style I don't usually like and keep it compulsively readable. About 40 pages into this section, there is an abrupt mid-sentence ending. I turned the page, and another section was beginning.<br /><br />The first five sections of the book end mid-story. The sixth story is complete. Then, the first five stories are concluded in reverse order.<br /><br />Each section reads as if it's by another author from another time. The second section is a series of letter written in Europe in 1931. The third is a mystery/thriller that takes place in the US in the 60s. The fourth is in present-day England. The fifth is in a corprocratic future in Japan. The sixth is in a post-apocalyptic Hawaii.<br /><br />Don't be intimidated. Just read it and enjoy brilliant, literary delight.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Ordered and delivered via standard delivery halfway across the world (New Zealand) and it arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect condition. Either they have lifted their packaging game or I got lucky but it was shrink wrapped to a base and then placed in larger carton so potential damage was minimised. Happy with the presentation as was the person I had bought it for as a gift.
0060839872|2.0|In maintaining an active interest in philosophy I was quite eager to tackle this somewhat enigmatic work.  This title is one of thos that you oft hear mentioned and rarely discussed.  What I encoutnered was a pseudo-biographical work that presents it's ideas and concepts slowly, poorly and seemingly as condescendingly as possible.  I would only advise those well versed in classical greek philosophy to even consider this text.  The areas of the text pertaining to Zen Buddhism are very welcome and far to short ... even if the points made are rudimentary and well known today.
B00005JMK0|5.0|One of my 80's favorite films and still not released on DVD .... unbelievable !!! Anxiously waiting and hoping to get an e-mail soon from Amazon saying YOU CAN PURCHASE THIS DVD NOW !!!!!!!!!

1582701709|5.0|The wealth that I feel after reading this book is incredible. It is very well written and had trouble putting it down. If mastering your own destiny is important to you, then it is a must read.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|Star Trek fans and other viewers have long derided this film for what it did not do.  It did not follow on from the tension and excitement in First Contact, and it did not on the other hand live up to the pre-film hype that it would return to the humour of Star Trek IV. <br />However, with benefit of hindsight, this is in fact one of the Next Generation movies that does live up to Roddenberry's ideal - there is a real theme and message here that Roddenberry would have been happy to put his name to. <br />The story starts when Data, involved in a duck-blind observation of the Ba'ku, a peaceful 'new-age-y' sort of race, goes apparently rogue.  Picard and crew come to investigate, only to find that the planet may have the secret to eternal youth, and the observers have more than observing in mind - they plan the mass eviction of the Ba'ku.  Picard is placed in a position of choosing between principle and his career, living out the moral centre ideal that Roddenberry loved so much. <br />There are elements of humour, some welcome fan appreciated vignettes, such as Geordi having a chance to see, Riker and Troi becoming close again, and the story moves along at a respectable pace.  Set design is impressive, and the movie benefits from more on-location sets than any other Next Generation movie, giving it a unique identity.  However, the darker edge IS missed, and while good, the movie never quite reaches the heights of some of its predecessors, or explores the themes quite as much as you would want it to. <br />So this particular disc will live or die on the extras - and they are a worthy set.  Sadly, there is no director's commentary by Frakes, but there is a text commentary for the Trek Trivia inclined, by Michael and Denise Okuda.  On the second disc there are small chunk sized featurettes on production, special effects and the Star Trek Universe, as well as deleted scenes and archive photos and storyboards.  The deleted scenes are of interest, but were rightfully dispensed with to maintain pace.  The featurettes are often PR fluff, but quality fluff that genually educates on special effects in particular.  One standout is the interview with the writer Michael Piller who is surprisingly candid about the end script, and gives some fascinating insight into what the script evolved from - the earlier drafts which were more of a 'Heart of Darkness' story, must have been fascinating! <br />All in all, if you don't have it, then this is definitely the one to get.  If you have it already then you probably have all you need to have to form your own opinion of the movie. <br />If you have not seen the movie - don't be put of by the negative talk - sure, this is no Wrath of Khan, but it is probably (arguably!) the second best of the Next Generation movies.
B000031XCR|5.0|This was my first CD by Celine and I can't say enough how GREAT it is.  I love every song.  Celine has the type of voice that probably anything she sings will come out sounding beautiful.  Thank you Celine for such a great CD.
B000J103PC|5.0|I went in expecting a movie that was intended for women.  In other words, a romance comedy, or something similar.    That's NOT what I got.  Instead I got a really good understanding of the amazing amount of stress that fashion models have to go through in order to stay fit and be as close to perfect as humanly possible.  Because of this movie, I found out that the life of a fashion model is NOT just a simple cakewalk, and that these models really have to work to be the center of attention in magazines and whatnot.  Having to go through life this way is not as easy as it sounds.  You have to dress correctly, walk correctly, have a perfect smile, etc.  Not easy at all.    Meryl Streep plays an old lady who has the NASTIEST attitude I have ever seen someone have.  She isn't afraid to speak exactly how she feels, and the entire movie is about the main character (Anne Hathaway) having to stay focused and fit in with the world of fashion models in order to be successful at her job (even though she appears to be out of place in that kind of environment).      I really liked the movie.  I laughed a bit, learned a lot, and thought everyone's performance was spot-on.  Recommended.
0694524441|5.0|This is story is so beautiful!  It's about destiny, courage, following your heart, and forging your own path.  It makes an excellent gift. <br /> <br />I like the audio version in particular because the narration is excellent.  I listen to audiobooks when doing exercise and mundane tasks and audiobooks like this are so engaging that I'm finished with the task before I realize any time has passed.  This audiobook is good for people of all ages and educational backgrounds.
B000M2E2QY|5.0|I first the song Grace Kelly five days ago. I immediately fell in love with it. It just makes you want to dance, so after playing that song over and over  for a few days, I decided to listen to the entire album. It is AMAZING. It's the kind of album where you like the songs at first listen. The violins and orchestra in this music makes it brilliant. Mika is truly, in my opinion, the future of music. Some of my favorites off the CD are \\"In Any Other World\\" and \\"Happy Ending\\". The singers voice is so great, and the music is laid out perfectly. I would DEFINITELY buy this album if I saw it in stores, which I haven't yet. I've only listened to it one time through, but I already love it. <br /> <br />MIKA RULES!
0140441166|5.0|In this novel, the ingeneous author juxtaposes two forces of evil--the Vicomte de Valmont as the mysoginist who exploits female sexuality in order to ruin women, and the misanthropic woman--the Marquise de Merteuil, who is brilliant and evil enough to beat men at their own game.  That is, until she locks horns with the Vicomte.  In each other they meet their match, only this is far from a love match.  I think that in each other, they see embodied the very things they each hate about the opposite sex.  So, very aptly, their relationship may be called a hate match.<br /><br />In discussing the wicked deeds of these two characters, critics have attributed them to boredom.  One critic said that the two antagonists display a sort of pride in their skill at sexual intrigue.  I think that this assessment misses the point.  Everything that the Vicomte and the Marquise do in the story is a game leading only to one goal--they each have a burning desire to destroy the other.  This may not be readily apparent, but I think that when you realize how much they both hate each other, it is not possible that they could have had any other end for each other in mind.  The relationship is one of hate, and their goal is mutual ruin.  The people they hurt and destroy are not the point.  The point is they want to ruin each other, and they use anyone and everyone to accomplish this goal.  Poor Cecile and Danceny are tertiary damage.<br /><br />The Madame de Rosemonde, who is the Vicomte de Valmont's aunt in the story, described the affair perfectly toward the end of the book.  In a letter to Madame de Volanges she states, \\"I recoil from entering into the least detail concerning this pack of horrors.\\"  A pack of horrors it is, but one worth studying.  Rarely does a novel provide such a profound and thorough examination of hatred, in particular the hatred between the sexes.  However, brace yourself.  It is not a comfortable experience to look at hatred this up-close.  Like Madame de Rosemonde, one wants to recoil as well.<br /><br />The movies that have been made from this book do not really do it justice.  I think that everyone deserves the experience of reading this book personally.  I think you will learn something about the war of the sexes that may make you reflect on your own misoginistic or misanthropic feelings, thereby providing you with a critical view of the fabled \\"war between the sexes.\\"  If you have such feelings, it will make you question why you feel that way and to what end do you harbor these feelings and perspectives.
0140131558|5.0|I do not see this work the way Auster constructed it. To me it is not a 'trilogy' even though there are overlapping themes, and incidents. I see it as a collection of separate pieces. The first and the third are first-rate works of fiction . They are novels which are searches for self. They are -Multiple- identity -mysteries which illustrate Auster's way of seeing life and the world, as unending chance and surprise.<br /><br />Perhaps the best summary of the Auster credo comes somewhere in the middle of 'The Locked Room' The narrator- best friend of Fanshawe meditates as follows.<br /><br />\\" We all want to be told stories and we listen to them in the same way we did when we were young. We imagine the real story inside the words, and to do this we substitute ourselves for the person in the story, pretending that we can understand him because we understand ourselves. This is a deception.We exist for ourselves, perhaps, and at times we even have a glimmer of who we are, but in the end we can never be sure, and as our lives go on, we become more and more opaque to ourselves, more and more aware of our own incoherence. No one can cross the boundary into another-for the simple reason that no one can gain access to himself.\\"<br /><br />Auster is a supreme storyteller. In these works there are stories within stories of incredible power and beauty. In the first book there is a small story of a mother in the Shoah carrying a baby for whom she at last has the satisfaction of attaining and giving milk. The baby has been dead for days. In the concluding work of the Trilogy Auster tells the story of Lorenzo da Ponte whose life he describes as five or six distinct lives, illustrating a principle of Auster's fiction i.e. we can never know for certain where the story of the life is going to next.<br /><br />I may not agree with Auster's philosophy of life but find him one of the supreme storytellers writing today . I pick up his work and I want to read and read and read.
B000J4QWM2|1.0|Please keep in mind that crime detective shows are about the bottom of the list when it comes to things I enjoy on television.  Sometimes they can build a *little* suspense, but most of the time (like in this movie) the plot ends up dragging and dragging... and dragging some more.   <br /> <br />As these kind of movies roll along, you typically begin to forget the purpose of the main things you see happening on screen because you stop caring about the storyline and the characters and just end up wishing the movie would hurry up and finish.  That was the case with me and this Miami Vice movie.  Boring as a film can possibly be, in my opinion.  It's like one person could write a storyline similar to the one in this film in about 45 minutes.  But it's not really my thing, so please understand.  I'm sure more thought and energy went into creating it. <br /> <br />However, I really think there was very little in the way of action, and WAY too much time was spent during the middle parts of the film involving a quiet, slow-building relationship between Colin Farrell and the Chinese woman.  So boring.  It seemed like it was never going to end.  I really hate these kind of movies.  A movie that takes two hours to tell a story which ends up going NOWHERE.  The appeal of a movie like this boggles my  mind.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|Definitely worth every penny, this 50th anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition of Forbidden Planet is THE premier version on the market and the fundamental reason why 99% or more of all buyers get it (check the stat)!  Very well crafted, the full color tin beckons you to the excitement within.  As a collector, you'll be pleased with the Robby die-cast miniature (personally, I've left mine behind the cellophane packaging, but that's a personal call).  The artistic lobby card miniatures are another welcome bonus - and very nicely produced, too.  (And the mail-in order form for an original-size theatre poster for a few bucks can't be beat - get it.)  Upon arrival, I was overjoyed with the beautiful tin and overall product packaging.  With respect to content - this one has it all.  I'd never viewed the Thin Man episode \\"Robot Client\\" before now, and also didn't own a copy of The Invisible Boy - two very essential genre-related works that are a welcome edition to the package.  The collection of deleted and \\"lost\\" scenes make up the better part of an additional half hour of original movie content and SFX test footage.  My only complaint is I seem to remember an edited-out scene included on the original Criterion Collection laserdisc (I don't own one) of a ship-board wedding between Nielsen and Francis which is still missing here.  Content-wise, this 2 disc collection lives up to its reputation, and is jammed packed with hours and hours of bonus material - I won't list them here: read the official Editorial Reviews above!  As far as quality is concerned, I've never seen a cleaner print: clearly digitally restored, as clear and \\"scratch-free\\" as they come.  The audio is stunning - you'll enjoy the Barron's electronic \\"tonalities\\" score as never before with a fully re-mastered Dolby Digital 5.1 surround presentation.  Bottom line: get this version if you have no budgetary constraints.  I personally think the extras are worth the price difference over the lower-cost 2 disc-only package.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|A pretty good wrap up to the story of the Xmen.  I thought the plot was a little thin in some areas but on the whole it was a lot of fun to watch.  A good popcorn movie.

0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirst Ali is the Somali born human rights activist who came to the world's attention when the murderer of Theo van Gogh left a message accusing her of defiling Islam. She at the time was living in Holland where she had sought refuge after not taking the flight to Canada  to an arranged marriage she did not want. In Holland she worked hard, graduated from Leiden University, tried to help Islamic women who were being persecuted by their husbands. She also became a parliamentarian. As the death threats to her mounted , she who as a young person had supported the fatwa on Salman Rushdie , she understood that she must move to safer territory. She now makes her home in the United States where she is a member of a conservative think- tank 'The American Enterprise Institute'.<br /><br />Ali is fundamentally a human rights activist who believes in Enlightentment values. While she is deeply concerned about Islam's failure to provide women with basic human freedoms- she is concerned about all of mankind having freedom of speech and expression, the right to be educated, the ability to choose one's own path in life.<br /><br />Her own courageous example in which she chose to go outside an oppressive framework and stand alone is perhaps too difficult and extreme for most to follow. But clearly her passionate conviction, her clarity of expression do speak to the very real need to provide each and every human being on earth basic freedoms and the opportunity to create their own life in dignity.

076531178X|4.0|I picked up Mistborn on a lark- based in large point by the written praise of Robin Hobb (an author whose work I greatly enjoy.  I have not yet read Elantris, the author's first work.  So, with an open mind, I picked up Mistborn... <br /> <br />And was greatly impressed!  I consider myself a fan of Jordan, Hobb, Martin, Erickson, Williams and have recently enjoyed the works of R. Scott Bakker.  I can now add Brandon Sanderson to the list. <br /> <br />The product description, and some of the other reviews, give pretty accurate assessments of the story and plotline. <br /> <br />So, with that in mind, it's worth highlighting a few of the strengths and weaknesses of his story- with an eye toward hoping the weaknesses are resolved come book 2... <br /> <br />Strengths: <br />*  Nice world-building <br />*  Good story arch/plotline <br />*  Original \\"magic\\" system <br /> <br />Weakness: <br />*  Prose/dialogue/elocution:  Several passages of inter-character discussions were ... just.. too explanatory.  I (personally) try to gauge when reading items whether people in an actual conversation would speak the way an author portrays.  And, unfortunately, especially after \\"major\\" plot points, I felt some of the conversations between characters were just... too long- near soliloquy's vs. being dialogue.  Again, this is a style point and a personal tick of mine.  <br />*  \\"Generic\\" characterizations:  Much has been made of Vin's ability to swiftly learn allomancy; however, both she and Kelsier were the most fully-drawn characters.  Other characters- Marsh, Breeze, etc- were more shallowly drawn.  Again, I'm not talking about the need for Jordanian descriptions, but, within the context of a 3rd person-limited perspective, I'd like to gain a bit more insight into how the current person (aka Vin) feels/knows/sees of these other important secondary characters. <br /> <br />So, take that as you will, but, no matter what: buy and enjoy the book.  For an author's second work, it's fantastic.  I look forward to reading Elantris, and, also, book 2 of this series.
B00005JOLI|5.0|My 12yo. son loved the book so we took him to see the movie.  It's hard to believe that this movie got such bad reviews considering the other movies that hollywood puts out.  The movie isn't accurate to the book but still a good movie for the kids with good vs. evil theme.  My son can't wait for the sequel.
B000CNE092|5.0|Family loves it and watches it over and over.  Bought the music too.
0553277472|5.0|For a long time, I struggled with finding religion. I wasn't raised as anything, Christian Jew or otherwise. Eastern religions have held the most appeal for me, since I am an intellectual type. However, this book is good for reasons beyond the mundane. If you enjoy thinking about abstract concepts, and second-guessing deep-rooted beliefs about what life is and why we're here, this book is for you.
0743298020|4.0|This book is as strange and bizarre to read as the writer is to look upon.  If it were a news story Social Services would arrest the entire family.  It took some time for me to get into the reading - it is hard to enter.  After reading for a while you feel as if you were sitting on the side of the road watching a car accident and you just can't stop looking.  The entire family is nuts and the ending shows a totally perverted family.  Some parts make you turn away, some you just shake your head.  I say read it but be prepared for an outrageous family that makes you glad that you don't live in the house next door.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Once upon a time I worked at a book/music store. During the Holiday Season we would play every genre of Christmas CD for the listening pleasure of our customers. I think I have probably heard them all, and I noticed that some collections were nice, some nostalgic and some ANNOYING. Many didn't even give a Christmas-y feeling or vibe at all!<br /><br />I sure wish that James Taylor's Christmas Album would have been available then. What a wonderful CD: the first time you hear it, I guarantee it will put you in a lovely Christmas mood. JT himself wrote in the album notes, this cd is intended to be played while \\"trimming the tree and quaffing eggnog...\\"<br /><br />I can't pick a favorite tune, they're all delightful: but here are some stand-outs: the breezy \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" (the best version I've ever heard!), \\"Some Children See Him\\" (beautifully touching without being sappy), \\"Jingle Bells\\" (100% JT!) and the rousing, Celtic-flavored \\"Auld Lang Syne.\\"<br /><br />A perfect Christmas Album.
B00018D44U|5.0|I love the vibe and sound of this album. \\"The Prettiest Thing\\" and \\"Sunrise\\" are two of my favorite songs on this album. Norah's voice is just lovely and the music is melodious and beautiful. I really enjoy listening to this album, it soothes me after a long day.  <br />
B00006F7S4|4.0|Heard this one when I was getting divorced. This and \\"Tunnel of Love\\" by Bruce Springsteen were theraputic to my ears. I mean \\"Lost Cause\\" any one? Great album to do some serious boozing to...
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|The movie has everything...love...drama...thrills...suspense. The story line helps to introduce (those not familiar with Titanic and her demise) to the characters and events surrounding that fatful night. A must see for the historic crowd as well as the love story crowd.

B00003CXCD|5.0|'Roman Holiday' is a delightful movie for many reasons. It captures the essence of the regency period with a fairy tale princess, during an innocent time of life that was much simpler. Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck were cast perfectly for their roles and complemented one another nicely. It was light-hearted but at the same time conveyed a more serious meaning. Sometimes one must sacrifice what one truly wants for the greater good of sociey. This was all too poignant at the end of the movie. <br />I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to the sentimental hearted. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006AUIG|5.0|Session 9 is a contemporary tale of terror set in an abandoned insane asylum. The residents on Danvers, Massachusetts steer well clear of the place. But Danvers State Mental Hospital, closed down for 15 years, is about to receive five new visitors. This is a brilliant example of horror filmaking on a shoe string budget.The basic storyline involves a hazardous waste disposal crew cleaning up a mental hospital which has been closed for 15 years.<br /><br />There are rumors of patient abuse. One of the crew members discovers a series of haunting session recordings that draws him (as well as the viewer) into the depths of a young girl's torment. The acting is good,especially David Caruso's performance, understated, multi dimensioned and believable. The interior shots, where most of the movie takes place is shot in gritty gray/green tones the color of every old hospital, or institution.<br /><br />The corridors are long and claustraphobic. The strands of each characters life begin to clash and emesh, moving at times in a slow moody crawal till at the end of the movie revelations flash by at breakneck speed. I found myself holding my breath as the tension grew to an almost unbearable level. The conclusion was a complete suprise to me. I highly recommend this film for the horror fan who appreciates the gradually growing dread of the works of Alfred Hitchcock and H. P. Lovecraft. This is my third viewing and it gets better each time I watch it.
B000LXHK22|2.0|I read the book flying to the West Coast from Florida, and saw the movie a week later on the way back on the plane.  All I can say is, how could anyone who read this book make this movie?  The only thing that stayed the same was Provence.  They emasculated the mystery plot, made Russell Crowe a supersucessful trader instead of a broke ex-trader who needed to borrow money from Charley to get to France, etc.  Contrived plot changes for dramatic effect are just stupid--running Fanny off the road, falling into the swimming pool, and the little car are three things that the book didn't need.  Ridley Scott should be ashamed of this one.  Two stars for the Provence scenery.

B000I2J6K0|3.0|I did the 40 minute routine for the 1st time yesterday. I am only 8 weeks pregnant and found this DVD to be somewhat challenging.  I can't imagine what it would be like for someone who is further along.  I would recommend this workout for someone that is already a seasoned exerciser. It's fast paced, so I would not recommend this DVD for a beginner.  I am an avid runner (average 8-15 miles/week) and regular gym visitor (4 days/week using an elliptical and bike), a yoga student (1-2 days/week) and a former step aerobic student.  What I didn't like about this routine was that I had to re-arrange my furniture in order to do some of the exercises in Segment 1 (the 40 minutes is divided into 4 segments.)  I wished the DVD had prepared me for what was needed as far as \\"equipment.\\" I had to keep running around the living room/dining room to \\"find\\" and \\"arrange\\" the needed equipment. So those of you that wish to purchase this DVD, you will need a sturdy coffee table, the edge of your couch, a flat wall, a dining room chair, a living room cushioned chair (I don't have one of these and used the loveseat) and an exercise mat. The other thing I didn't like about the DVD were some of the crazy camera angles and the fact that Erin doesn't always countdown the number of reps.  For some of the floor exercises, you are supposed to keep a long neck (looking down while on all fours), however Erin wasn't giving instructions and I had to keep looking up at the TV to figure out what I supposed to be doing.  Overall, I did have a pretty good workout. It got my heart rate up and I did sweat a little.  I'm sure I will get better at keeping up with the routine.
B000M5AJQS|2.0|A convoluted, unnecessarily foul-mouthed (Wahlberg, a usually likable performer, is nominated for a one dimensional sewer-mouthed twit?), and bloated, unengaging film (until the final hour) is sloppy seconds compared to   Scorcese's earlier work.  Accents come and go (hello, Jack? Martin?), the love interest is pointless/underdeveloped, and the Shakespearean ending, while jolting, is ultimately ridiculous.  Just in case you miss the heavy-handed message, watch for the rodent in the final scene....  Trim the run time, axe a few characters, focus the conflict, develop character (no, profanity doesn't develop character) and then release a director's cut.

044024157X|4.0|While John Grisham has achieved most of his success with his legal thrillers, he has also tried his hand at more contemplative and literary works (A Painted House) with reasonably good results.  \\"The Last Juror\\" sees Grisham forge in a new direction, by creating a blend of both these two styles.  But does it work?  The first part of the book focuses on what we know Grisham is good at: the legal thriller, with action revolving around the courtroom.  In typical Grisham style, this is what is served up in Part 1, and returns in Part 3.  It's what we expect from Grisham, and will undoubtedly please the fans looking for the usual Grisham fare.<br /><br />However in the second part of the book, Grisham switches gears and takes a leisurely and slower-paced excursion in which he treats more serious issues such as the relation between whites and blacks, and the role and function of the church.  Much of this is addressed through the eyes of the young newspaperman William Traynor, by giving close attention to the character of Miss Callie Ruffin, an elderly black woman and mother of eight.  Miss Callie is one of the jurors alluded to in the title, who served nine years earlier in the trial of Danny Padgitt, a member of the criminal clan of Padgitts inhabiting Padgitt Island.  The sensational trial resulted in Danny's conviction for the rape and murder of widow Rhoda Kasselaw.  But now that Danny has served his time in prison and returned to civilization, one by one the jurors that were involved in case are killed.<br /><br />This deadly action at the close of the novel is exciting, and is probably what the average Grisham fan is looking for.  But it has to be admitted that it only takes place in the last 20% of the book (Part 3), and it takes a significant amount of time to get this point.  Quite frankly, I didn't find the extended diversion in Part 2 sufficiently gripping or interesting, at least, not after the more suspenseful appetizer dished up in Part 1.  Certainly Traynor's relationship with Miss Callie is touching at times, and Grisham seems to be experimenting with the more literary style of A Painted House by incorporating a more personal touch and developing well-rounded characters in this portion of the novel.  But in the end, this doesn't seem to fit with the legal thriller that the rest of the book wants to be.<br /><br />The title is also raises some intriguing questions.  Although Miss Callie's character is important, it's not quite clear to me why the book should be named after her.  Moreover, the title itself is somewhat misleading, perhaps deliberately so, in order to create wrong expectations in the mind of the reader, because it implies that Miss Callie will be the last juror to be killed, whereas in fact it simply denotes that she was the last juror chosen at the time of the trial.<br /><br />Ultimately, Grisham's blend of styles doesn't seem to work: The Last Juror appears to be two stories in one, one a legal thriller and the other a more heart-warming literary tale, and both threads don't really don't come together properly.  Grisham has proven himself reasonably skilled in both styles, but on this occasion the oil of legal thrillers and the water of literary novels just don't mix well.  While I admire Grisham for being prepared to try something different, and acknowledge that this will perhaps give some measure of satisfaction to those who enjoyed the more literary style we first saw in A Painted House, the reality is that \\"The Last Juror\\" will probably disappoint many Grisham fans.  Don't read The last Juror looking for a pageturning thriller from beginning to end, but if you have any appreciation for the more laid-back charm of A Painted House, you'll also find something to like here too. - GODLY GADFLY's relationship with Miss Callie is touching at times, and Grisham seems to be experimenting with the more literary style of A Painted House by incorporating a more personal touch and developing well-rounded characters in this portion of the novel.

0743457900|5.0|Upon publication in April, 1974,  John Le Carre's \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\" was  acclaimed a masterpiece of the cold war spy genre, and short listed -- along with several other Le Carre works-- for greatest spy story of them all.  Firstly, there was Le Carre's immense, first-hand, front-line spying experience.  His lean, mean writing.  The plot, dealing with Britain's MI5 international spy agency; it's a marvel of clarity and complexity.  The irresistible narrative force.  Another of the author's great set piece openings, plus a few more.<br /><br />As to the characters, there's the long-suffering George Smiley, his beautiful offstage wife Lady Ann.  The inscrutable Bill Haydon: at one point, late in the narrative, Smiley does actually think of him as that Russian doll: one doll within another, within another.  The implacable opponent, Russia's Karla, head of KGB, MI5's opposite number.  Smiley's confrontation with him, in a 1950's Indian prison, sears itself into the brain.  The whole MI5 gang: control, Percy Alleline, Ricky Tarr, Roy Bland, Peter Guillam, Inspector Mendel, Oliver Lacon, Toby Esterhase, Connie Sachs, Jerry Westerby, and, most importantly, Jim Prideaux, the loyal man most severely injured by a Czechoslovakian cock-up.  Finally, Bill Roach, richest boy at the school where Prideaux now teaches, emotionally resonant,fat, miserable, and devoted to Prideaux.<br /><br />A dying control (head of organization) believes there's a mole-- that is, a long-term counterspy placed within a spying organization-- it's a term Le Carre actually invented, and the world now uses-- in MI5.  In control's effort to smoke out the mole, so-called Gerald, the chief sets in motion an ill-advised Czechoslovak operation, with disastrous results.  So at control's death, Percy Alleline, one of the boys, benefiting from an all-around wizard source, takes over the organization and gets his knighthood.  But the mole's still flashing his presence.  So who is it: in control's immortal words, taken from a British children's rhyme-- tinker, tailor, soldier, spy, or Smiley, whom we learn is beggarman?  (Oddly enough, this famous formulation, the book's title, is not introduced until late.)  The minister in charge sets Smiley to find out.<br /><br />Coming back to this book after many years, thing I find most striking is that there's a dimension beyond tight writing, knowing spycraft, masterful plot and characters: feeling.  Smiley, close to finally unraveling the betrayal, confronts Esterhase, chief of the lamplighters: the tradecraft men.  \\"It is the perfect fix; you see that, don't you Toby, really?  Assuming it is a fix.  It makes everyone wrong who's right: Connie Sachs, Jerry Westerby...Jim Prideaux...even control.  Silences the doubters before they've even spoken out...The permutations are infinite, once you've brought off the basic lie....Take it to its logical conclusion, and Gerald would have us strangling our own children in their beds.\\"<br /><br />Smiley is angry, as is his creator, and that will influence the outcome of the final great set-piece, the book's conclusion.  It earns its perch on the short list.rom a British children's rhyme-- tinker, tailor, soldier, spy, or Smiley, whom we learn is beggarman?

Although the book attempts to cover all the possible bases in the business community, its message is generic enough to apply to the basics of your unique business venture. This book is a good place to start in your efforts to become aware of the business start-up environment.

B000J10EQU|5.0|Superman Returns, up up and away, to the big screen once again.  I admit I was a little uncertain about the portrayal of our beloved hero by the relatively new actor Brandon Routh, but after I saw it, all fears were laid to rest.  Kevin Spacey also did a splendid job as Lex Luthor.  I honestly have no complaints about this movie.  This time around, the filmmakers showcase Superman's powers better than ever before (at least partially due to advances in filmmaking).  You really get the idea that Superman is the king of all heroes, with a heart of solid gold.  He is truly worthy of leading the Justice League (also fiction, I know, but what's wrong with a little fantasy?).  This movie is a real treat, and a very moving experience.  If you are a fan of superhero or action movies, this movie belongs in your collection without a doubt.

B00099BPOW|3.0|Claudio Abbado, who I believe was head of La Scala when this Aida was made, is capable of exciting Verdi readings, but this isn't one of them. I don't know if he was trying to make the score sound less like a warhorse by smoothing it out and reducing the melodrama, but Aida isn't really a warhorse: it's a masterpiece that deserves total passion and commitment. His staid tempos and underpowered climaxes frustrated me from beginning ot end.<br /><br />As for the singing, Domingo was much more powerful in hhis two other studio recordings opposite Leontyne Price for RCA and Monserrat Caballe for EMI. Here he seems to have been subdued by Abbado's understated interpreatation. As Aida, Katia Ricciarelli is severely over-parted.  She was a fill-in during the years when no credible dramatic sopranos were at hand, and therefore she landed roles like Tosca, Turandot, and this Aida that closest placement of the microphone can't make convincing. Her tone wobbles severely in climaxes, although I must admit that she tries to inject genuine dramatic fervor into her phrasing.<br /><br />By contrast, Obraztsova chews up the scenery as Amneris and has a clotted Slavic vocal tone that doesn't suit Verdi. The La Scala orhcestra and chorus sound less than enthusiastic. In sum, a big disappointment and one of the least convincing Aidas ever to emerge from a major label.
0618680004|1.0|Never in the fields of science or history have so many facts owed so much to so few - and to an author's vivid imagination.    Professor Richard Dawkins is an interesting character. It's extremely hard to understand how his (by his own convoluted admission) essentially meaningless belief system can generate such a tremendous amount of personal purpose and meaning, devoted entirely to convincing every single last one of us that essentially there is no purpose or meaning. Or at least not in their traditional, readily comprehensible forms - meaningless meaning will surely remain an elusive notion to most of us.     This incongruity may lead some to conclude that Dawkins is motivated by something other than a desire to liberate the world from the yoke of a God-ordained objective purpose. Then again, he does sound strangely sincere in his contention that universal atheism is a good idea. Still, whatever his motivations, writing a book is probably a healthier manifestation of the (consistently followed) atheistic mindset than would be another suicide, Soviet Union or Columbine.    Whilst Dawkins never approaches the sheer literary excellence of a C S Lewis, he isn't miles behind and can write with a refined clarity and an oftentimes skillfully amusing turn of phrase. Neither is he shy of employing some rather well-honed sleight-of-tongue techniques. So, in a sense, it's easy to appreciate how his provocative, anti-theistic speculations and re-hashings are music to the ears of the pure-bred atheist. And on those rare pages where he almost forgets how ridiculous and hideous God is, Dawkins surprisingly, and inadvertently, rivals the theist's capacity to appreciate and be inspired by the wonder of observable, operational science and creation.     From a vocabulary standpoint,  peccadillo  and  yoctosecond  were highlights - Dictionary.com defines a yoctosecond as being  One septillionth (10-24) of a second.     As for the highly pertinent issue of the cosmos and how it cameto be, Dawkins offers various naturalistic theories. Some are fascinating; others entertaining. All are marked by excessive speculation and an inability to be verified.     Without admitting for a second that those postulating an exclusively undesigned, naturalistic cause really haven't got the foggiest idea what caused what, when or how, Dawkins writes:      It may even be a superhuman designer - but, if so, it will most certainly not be a designer who just popped into existence, or who always existed. If (which I don't believe for a moment) our universe was designed, and a fortiori if the designer reads our thoughts and hands out omniscient advice, forgiveness and redemption, the designer himself must be the end product of some kind of cumulative escalator or crane, perhaps a version of Darwinism in another universe.      So, does Dawkins mean to say that the  designer  must be an  end product , even if the  designer  says he wasn't?    At the center of Dawkins' life, and, needless to say, this book, lies this unyielding conviction that any being so majestically complex as to be both eternal and able to speak a universe into existence is so staggeringly improbable that such a being defies belief. His conviction on this point is so obvious and so unyielding that should Dawkins ever actually meet such a majestically complex being - who, for the sake of argument, we'll refer to as  God  - he would presumably deny this being God status; and despite God's patient, demonstrable insistence that he is in fact God, the only God, and possesses all the Godly attributes commonly associated with the only God, would attempt - however briefly - to refute this being by calling upon his beloved, apparently impregnable  infinite regress  argument, which under these hypothetical circumstances would probably sound very much like this:  I simply don't believe. You simply cannot be immune to the regress. You're statistically improbable. You simply must have a cause. Everything has a cause. Therefore, calling yourself God is unwarranted, unhelpful and, if you don't mind my saying so, perniciously misleading. You must be the end product of some kind of cumulative escalator or crane...      A very few may admire Dawkins' stoicism on this hypothetical afterlife occasion, but I assume most others assembled at the time - regardless of any previously held atheistic concord - would cringe at it. Of course, this does nothing whatsoever to prove God's existence. Yet as I picture a scoffing Dawkins, I trust it illustrates just how ludicrously disbelieving an arch-atheist can be. And, of course, far from its being the epitome of reason and objectivity, this extreme, impossibly one-track position is where all of Dawkins' thoughts, interpretations, speculations and conclusions stem from.     ** We've reached word limits, but if you would like to read the remainder of review please proceed to my Amazon profile page by clicking on my name above (my web page is listed in the  about me  section).
B00028HBKM|3.0|despite all the contreveracy,  <br />this Historic Drama turned out to be worth the watch.   <br />  <br /> The use of a dead ancient language (used to lend authenticity) was to me a drawback.

B000J233I0|3.0|This bargain set from 1962 should be one of the top choices in the catalog to judge from the raves it's getting here, but in reality it has languished in and out of the catalog for years. There are many reasons why it should be esteemed. Bergonzi doesn't really have enough steel in his voice for Manrico, just as he doesn't have enough heft and passion for Rhadames. He's too controlled, and yet to counter that his voice is among the most beautiful of its generation, and he has style to spare. But listen to his \\"Di quella pira\\" and you hear Bergonzi strained to his limits, and in addition he has to fight against the aging Serafin's sluggish tempos, a persistent problem as this great opera maestro neared the end.<br /><br />But one can have no criticism of Cossotto's Azucena or the magnificent Bastianini as a dark, totally firm-voiced Di Luna. DG's analog sound is fine, and I could put up with Serafin's occasional lapse into sleepwalking were it not for the big hole in the middle of the cast Antonietta Stella, as others have noted, was a distant third in the 50s and 60s to Tebaldi and Callas, but greatness wasn't hiding in the shadows. She has a big, nice-sounding voice that she uses with utter caution, afraid to stretch even a little. As a result, one admires the voice for three minutes and then loses interest entirely. (Stella is also resented, innocently on her part, because EMI put her into its studio La Traviata from La Scala, depriving history of hearing Callas in arguably her greatest role--it's a long story.)<br /><br />In sum, opera buffs are doggedly devoted to their favorites, but this Trovatore lacks fire and has an inadequate Leonora. A near miss.

For this reason, at first, I was skeptical about the quality of an American made movie from the Japanese perspective.  But I was wrong. Letters From Iwo Jima (\\"Iwo Jima\\" means \\"Sulfur Island\\")  is pretty much accurate about Japanese people's mind and its history. This movie depicts each person's character very carefully, in a hopeless situation.  If you'd like to catch a glimpse of life in Japan toward the end of World War II, this film is also the one.

B000002GXJ|4.0|This two disc live album was mostly recorded on \\"The Long Run\\" tour, and if I remember correctly was actually released after the band had called it a day.  There are also a few tracks that are from the \\"Hotel California\\" tour as well when Randy Meisner was still a band member.  As a swan song it is a decent document of the band's career, although the vast majority of the album is taken from the previous two studio albums. The album is recorded well and the performances are flawless.  The Eagles have always been able to re-create their studio sound in a live setting and don't usually stray too far from the original studio versions.  In fact most of the solo's are played pretty much verbatim from the studio version.  So what do you get here that you wouldn't get from owning \\"Greatest Hits\\", \\"Long Run\\" or \\"Hotel California\\"?  Not really a lot.  Surprisingly the album contains not one, but two of Joe Walsh's solo hits in rowdy versions of \\"Life's Been Good\\" and \\"All Night Long\\".  There is also one new (at the time) song called \\"Seven Bridges Road\\" that really showcases the band's tight vocal harmonies.  The only other non single album track is Henley's \\"Saturday Night\\" which is nothing spectacular.  A bunch of the big hits make up the rest of the album, again played pretty much just like the studio versions.  I like this album and think it is a nice look at the band as it was at the time, but I would not say it is essential for Eagles fans.

B000063V8S|3.0|The picture seems to have improved over the third season and there were (as yet) no sound dips but as I am watching disc 3, episode 86, the colors are all wrong! The skin colour turned to green and the (command) uniforms color went from pinkish to crimson red, which is what happened when I watched those episodes live and tried ajusting the colors so that the uniforms would look more red, at the detriment of ending up with green skinned actors because until I saw the first DVD of ST:TNG I didn't exactly know what was the true color of those uniforms. They are indeed pinkish from the first DVD of season three up until now! Not buying any more ST:TNG DVDs. I gave it a three stars rating, since I gave two to the season 3 box set, but I am so disappointed by the poor quality overall that it should really be a two and a half. My last word on the subject.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a great documenttary. I just got it on region 2 DVD's. I'm a huge fan of David Attenborough and his series of DVD's, but this one is different in the sense that he is not on set, just pure narration. His voice sounds older, and possibly this is the reason he chose not to be on location while this series was being filmed. This dies detract from it IMHO. <br /> <br />The 5 DVD's are outstanding though, and the DVD's itself are extremely high quality, worth a watch just for this. It goes into detail about every climate on earth. David's narration is splendid but lacking some of the wit in past series, perhaps because he is not location? I gave it 5 stars because it is great, just not off the scale great, as some of his past DVD's are. Enjoy it! I did.

074356619X|5.0|My finacee' and I were in a metaphysical book store in downtown Portland, Oregon.  A wonderful Oriental Woman was very helpful and assisted us with our requests.  The dvd \\"The Secret\\" was displayed on the counter next to the cash register.  We inquired about the dvd and was told that it was a fantastic visual tool that will show us steps in how to change our perception and enjoy life. The cover itself was very magnetizing and we decided to purchase it.  When we got home to Kauai we couldn't wait to view it.  Once viewed--we couldn't stop talking about it and wanted to share it with all of our loved ones--we did!!  A website for the \\"Secret\\" was given on the dvd folder and we were lead to two other books.  1-The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Wattles and 2-The Master Key System by Charles F. Haanel.  These books are the information used in creating the wonderful movie \\"The Secret\\".  I highly recommend these lovely books--a must read!! You will never view life the same again. You will now understand that life is magnificient and is meant to be enjoyed. I will never again see a glass as half empty.

B00005JMAH|3.0|Yet another harry potter film on dvd. Am sure there will be more. lol <br /> <br />Kids will not be disappointed with this installment. <br />Visually appealing with wonderful color,  <br />This installment is a bit lacking,  <br />but is still mildly entertaining.  <br />
B000GY729M|3.0|Just not as sharply. Sometimes the worst thing that can happen to a band in popular music these days can be releasing such great debut. It causes such a raucous of criticism, during the making and after the release of a follow-up album. Being that I was one of the many who fell in love with their first album I was highly anticipating their sophomore album. I will admit it isn't what I wanted or expected. And some of the harsh criticism by many of the \\"major\\" critical magazines across the nation do hold some merit. However, the album does have bright spots here and their. \\"The River Is Wild\\" is a wonderful track and my personal favorite on the album. Some of the writing feels like Brandon Flowers was searching for something profound, and he fell short with most every attempt. This album is a long way from being great. But it is a good album. I recommend it to any fan of The Killers. But I am sure if you read this far you already own it.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I never saw Grey's Anatomy before until i saw the 1st episode.  After that, i went out and brought season 1 and 2.  This show is very additive and i love. I didn't want to stop watching it.  Now i have to catch up with season 3. <br />I highly recommend

B000K7VHQE|4.0|Plot Summary: A dysfunctional family road trip turns into a beautiful thing.<br /><br />Reason for the Rating: Language, some sex and drug content<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is the low-budget family road show parody that could.<br /><br />Directed by first time feature length movie directors, and husband/wife team, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, Little Miss Sunshine offers up a cast of brilliantly drawn characters who collectively make the Simpsons look like the all-American family by comparison.<br /><br />Meet Richard (Greg Kinnear) the family patriarch. Richard has driven the family to the edge of financial ruin with his dream of becoming the next Tony Robbins. The launch-point of Richard's career is a self-help book he desperately needs to publish. His wife, Sheryl (Toni Collette) wrestles to hold her fragile family together and occasionally resents the task. The eldest son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), is a self-proclaimed disciple of Nietzsche who wears anti-Jesus T-Shirts and has taken a vow of silence. Concentrating the levels of zaniness the family is Richard's heroine addicted father (Alan Arkin) who occupies a bedroom after being evicted from the nursing home. Last but not least is Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carell), a suicidal, homosexual Proust scholar.<br /><br />The lone source of innocence and joy in the home rests in Olive (Abigail Berslin). Olive is somewhat chubby girl with the naïve dream of entering and winning a beauty contest. It's this dream that forces the entire family to interrupt their ruts, pile into the family VW van and make the two-day journey to the tournament.<br /><br />The movie opens with Richard indoctrinating Olive with the pressure-packed words \\"The world is divided into winners and losers.\\" However, the journey is filled with zany encounters that force each family member to confront his or her personal measure of success. When the family arrives at the beauty contest they realize that they've led Olive to be harshly evaluated by judges and contestants alike. The family rallies to protect Olive and hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine beautifully portrays the power of family to protect and nurture, even when one, or in this case several, of the parts are broken and vulnerable. Still, it's the movie's portrayal of human brokenness that should give parents pause before allowing a teen to view this movie--the language is often foul, viewers repeatedly observe a character handling pornography, and grandpa is spotted snorting a line of cocaine.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine earned four Oscar nominations: Best Picture, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role (Alan Arkin), Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role (Abigail Berslin), and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Michael Arndt).<br /><br />MOVIEBLOG RECOMMENDS:<br /><br />Thought not for everyone, many parents and mature teens may enjoy the depiction - and ultimate family redemption - of the flawed characters in Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />AFTER THE SHOW:<br /><br />* How have you experienced the tension between the drive for success and family?<br /><br />* How has your family provided protection for each other in the past?<br /><br />* Some say the very first dysfunctional family was Adam & Eve.

B000003TA4|3.0|Widely hailed as one of the best albums ever released, Nevermind by Nirvana is nonethless nudging 17 years. <br /> <br />The music is very much in the Seattle grunge style (no surprises there), but that perticular music scene lost its mainstream appeal some time ago. <br /> <br />There are the occasional tracks, such as Smells Like Teen Spirit that can still inspire you, but unfortunately only in a nostalgic way. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the band I would recommend it, but otherwise stick with the Best Of.
0142000663|5.0|When I was a kid Steinbeck was one of my favorite authors. His observations always touched a nerve with me, and his characters always came alive, as the clich&eacute; goes. His stories were simple enough, the masterpiece Grapes of Wrath included, that the story enthralled me at the time, even if the politics somewhat escaped me.<br /><br />As most know, GOW is the story of undeserved poverty come to rest on an undeserving family. On the injustice of a capitalistic and bureaucratic society and the probable indifference of a not so loving God. Whether you reach Steinbeck's conclusions, and I personally don't, you can't escape how real the stories are themselves, how well told and entertaining and even humorous the most pointless and melancholic of human events can be.<br /><br />I remember as a high school kid being most disturbed by the government's attempt to battle the depression in the government's anti-common-sense way. With people literally starving to death the government, at the same time they gave handouts, were pouring kerosene on oranges and even shooting illegal \\"harvesters\\". It is hard to fathom today, the starvation I mean, not the logic twists of bureaucracy.<br /><br />There is a little something for everyone, for those who hate big business especially, but the government is not portrayed as much of a savior, either. If you need a happy ending this is not the book for you, but if you want one of the great American epics and a gritty slice of American history, this is a must read.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This documentary reviews the scientific evidence of global warming and it's dire consequences for the planet, its ecosystem and humans. The science is sound and the predictions are overwhealming. The issue at stake is our ability to survive as a civilization in the next centuries. One of the most important and encouraging messages of this \\"must see documentary\\" is that if we act quickly and decisively on a global scale we can curb the climate change and maybe prevent reaching a point of no return scenarios. We can and must invest in the future of the next generations. Global warming is not a problem of the future its a problem of now as it takes several decades to see the effects due to climatic inertia. The movie and associated websites inform the public on how we can act to slow global warming and help out by individual choices. It is encouraging that Al Gore , due to \\"an incovenient truth\\"  and his role in studying and transmiting this information, has already received nominations for a Novel Price and several other world recognized awards. Moreover, his conclusions are supported by major scietific and economic reviews such as the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change 2007 in Paris and the Stern Review from the UK. <br /> <br />I thoroughly encourage everybody to see this masterpiece and to encourage their friend and relatives to see it as well. Everybody with access to a TV must see this movie and act quickly.

B000LE1FAY|5.0|Belinda Carlisle takes an ooh la la stance on affairs of the heart with this highly-anticipated release. Heavenly and hook-laden in the 80's, Belinda sheds her polished Regan-era image for French street cred and the result is an eclectic array of songs dealing with such timeless themes heartache, lust, and of course, love.  <br /> <br />Sharpening her teeth on the French language, Belinda places an erratic spin on such themes by feeding off a number of musical genres for this release including folk, dance, and electronic indie numbers. \\"Bonnie Et Clyde\\" sounds fitting for an obscure French spy movie, while \\"Ma Jeunesse Fout Le Camp\\" aches with Belinda's pitch-perfect wail in the background, fitting for a French-Middle Eastern fusion. Entering campy territory with \\"Contact\\", listeners will quickly note a Belinda left uncovered in the past: a woman on the verge of taking a risk.
B000002MG1|5.0|No words to express how great this album is.Critics and people agree this is a masterpiece.One of the album you are going to listen all your life.. <br />Best tracks ? C'mon get serious All of them 10/10
B00007KWHG|5.0|After all these years it can be easy to forget how prolific these guys were with hit after hit.  From 1 through 20, these are all great songs everyone from that era will remember vividly.  In my opinion, there are only 2 ommissions that I would have included here... Marlena and Silence is Golden.  Aside from those two, this is a very comprehensive compilation of their best hits.
B0001NBMEE|1.0|I love the King Arthur Era movies, but was not thrilled with this one. I found it to be a bit slow, and the characters were not very engaging.There are plenty of other movies like this that are much more enjoyable
B000HOJBDG|5.0|Let me start by saying I am not a big fan of Duke Ellington. I have loads of respect for the man, but I am not enthusiastic about big band jazz. I find a lot of his performances, big band and otherwise, to be very dry and uninspired. From the moment I put this record on it was obvious that this was something different. Like most projects involving Mingus, the bass is extremely dominant on this recording. The rhythms on this album are very unique, not only for Duke Ellington, but for the era. <br /> <br />This album is slightly deceiving in a way. It often has light, airy melodies, but are countered by heavy, intricate bass lines or spurts of heavy chords on the piano. Each track contains several different moods and ideas. The compositions are very complex and yet do not, on the surface, appear to be. Duke Ellington is a phenomenal player, and his ability really comes through on this recording. Combined with Charles Mingus and Max Roach, the trio is infallible. I can say with a fair amount of certainty that this is my favorite recording Ellington has ever done.
B00005JPKC|5.0|WOW. Having now seen both FLAGS and LETTERS, I definitely have to give credit to Eastwood for going the extra mile and creating this one. LETTERS far more superior than Flags. This should've been the one to be released first. It really shows how both sides never really understood each other. Whereas in Flags the Japs looked so evil. Well here its the complete opposite. We sympathize with characters and understand where they're coming from. Here the Americans are the evil ones, gunning down the Japs when they tried to surrender. Probably the most interesting character in the movie has to be the one delivered by Ken Watanabe. He's an amazing actor. I could watch this guy peel potatoes all day and not be bored. Overall: not some much war scenes, this movie focuses more on the soldiers personal stories, and it really is engaging.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Johnny Cash left a huge legacy of recordings from a career that spanned six decades, so to condense that catalog into one CD is a nearly impossible feat.  This collection comes about as close as one could hope, though - \\"Legend\\"  starts with his very first single, \\"Cry Cry Cry\\"/\\"Hey Porter\\" and works through most of the familiar classics: \\"I Walk the Line\\", \\"Ring of Fire\\", \\"Jackson\\", \\"A Boy Named Sue\\", and so on into the 70's.  Then it jumps to his \\"comeback\\" era, starting with his collaborations with the Highwaynen (Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson) and U2.  Finally, we get to the sublime \\"American Recordings\\", his inspired and moving series of stripped-down and personal performances produced by Rick Rubin, ending with \\"Hurt\\", one of the most mesmerizing and cathartic covers anyone has ever done of any song.  This is the only single CD on the market, to my knowledge, that tries to summarize Cash's entire career, so that makes it a pretty good introduction to the Man in Black.
B00005JPAM|2.0|I hate to break it. But i don't get what's all the fuss about this movie. Yes Helen Mirren gives an amazing performance as Queen Elisabeth II but thats pretty much it. The movie itself is pretty boring. Best director? There really wasn't that much going on. Doesn't mean that the movie is based on true events means it HAS to be a good movie automatically. C'mon. Thank god this movie was short movie, cause if it had ran over 120min i'd probab walk out or fall asleep. All the acting were only 'reactions', The ending was satisfying with a little foreshadowing if anyone picked up on it. Overall. Helen Mirren walks home with the gold, but the movie would be a real stinker with out her.

0743289412|1.0|Please bear with me for one moment: From age 13 to 35, I have read Stephen King's work with a mixture of admiration and frustration. Everyone who reads King has a few favorites and a few \\"not-as-goods,\\" but his books usually give some measure of satisfaction or entertainment. The frustration, for me, kicked in sometime around \\"Desperation\\", or maybe \\"Insomnia\\", when his books stopped being SCARY or COOL or UNIQUE and they just vaulted into WEIRD and KIND OF DUMB. As I read through \\"Everything's Eventual\\" and the tail end of the Dark Tower series, I thought that King was off his game but was still bringing something to the table every now and then...at least, something that made buying his books worth my time. I thought this book would be interesting. It sounds like a romance, or maybe a glimpse of a love letter to King's wife, Tabitha, in which we see a different side of him and how he views mortality. When I read the book jacket I felt even more strongly that the book would explore King's notion of love.  After starting \\"Lisey's Story\\", however, I can say that this is the first Stephen King book (and I have read everything he has ever written)that I put in my car, forgot I owned it, and neglected to finish. The story features a woman named Lisey whose husband Scott, a writer, has passed away. She is dealing with the stress of his death as well as the fragile mental state of her sister, a person who cuts herself and lapses into strange mental states periodically. The book also features sections that depict a meditative dream state in which Lisey lucidly remembers traumatic events from her marriage in which Scott got hurt or harmed himself. These events are marked by odd events in which Scott heals unnaturally quickly, or says secret words that no one understands. At this point I must stop, because I quit reading. However, Lisey is boring, boring, boring. her inner voice is boring. She repeats family phrases to herself and says the work \\"smucking\\" (instead of a popular epithet) too often. She did not strike me as a mourning wife but rather a shallow character, even sort of plain and slow-witted. Her husband Scott is also boring. He is not interestingly weird, he's just weird. The made up language they use, which King invented, is juvenile and maddening to read. After reading \\"bool\\" and \\"blood-bool\\" five thousand times, I laughed at how banal and boring...and just how odd the story was. I was trying to like it, really trying. But, I wasn't engaged in the story, I didn't care about the people, I didn't like Scott, I didn't like Lisey, I didn't care about her welfare. I hated the language they spoke and I hated the plot. And finally, I just decided to quit. For as long as he is alive, I will buy this man's books and I'm cool with that. But this book sucked. Avoid.

1569242739|5.0|it is rare i am inspired to write a review.  i saw the article in the NYTimes about this book and it's fabulous author and the pictures looked so good, i had to try it out. <br /> <br />the directions are easy to follow and the intro writing and \\"sprinkles\\" are funny and insightful.  Isa and Terry give ideas and suggestions like they are friends passing on a favorite recipe.  my first batch of cupcakes were a variation on the standard chocolate, using dark cocoa and orange extract.  my family hovered over them as they cooled and i am not ashamed to say that first batch didn't even get frosted.  they were light, tender and moist. i have never had vegan baked goods like this and i admit i was skeptical it was going to be pretty but not tasty. i dare anyone to make a better cupcake using eggs and dairy.  i don't believe it can be done. <br /> <br />oh! and the best part?! i can let my daughter lick the spatula without fear of food poisoning (and trust me, you will want to lick the spatula). <br /> <br />we aren't even a vegan family, but i am not sure i will ever use another book for cupcakes.  i hope Isa and Terry continue to produce such amazing work (and they might make a vegan out of me yet).
B000EULJLU|1.0|First of all I have to say I'm not a metal fan, indeed. I hate the genre in all its forms. My tastes are different, from so called prog (though this contraction from progressive (rock), doesn't actually mean anything to me) of the 70s, ELP, Pink Floyd, Genesis, to get to electronics (not techno, let's make it clear) of the best Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze and Steve Roach. But one day I decided to buy this 10,000 Days, because I like to think to be flexible, without prejudice. I found it used, and I bought ... and fortunately it was used! Now, latins said \\"de gustibus\\", but for me this record simply doesn't exist, and after only few listenings it's also disturbing, a bit like when for so long you did not open the windows of a room to change the air. Only the inside design of the cover is nice, interesting and unusual, with two lenses for a 3D vision of really splendid pictures. The music... where is it? I have found no idea, really none, apart from two or three passages soon ruined by all those irritating and chaotic metal cliché. But beyond all the labels which I try not to use to assimilate or know anything, I have not found any  evocative, mystical or even epic atmosphere, as I was told. I read on an article that someone found a parallelism between Tool and Pink Floyd from the Syd Barret era. Are we joking? Poor Syd. And the singer's voice? Ah, maybe someone is singing? I swear, I didn't noticed, unless we define those little child screaming \\"singing\\". Sure I listened to the CD several times with the earphones, with the utmost attention, and I couldn't believe it... One zero. That's all. This is music that goes nowhere, which hasn't got energy at all. What have we here? Dark and claustrophobic places, with no hope and no genial touch at all...Why? It's not moving. For my personal point of view this should be the purpose of music as well as any (true) art form: to give energy, to move, to make you think or feel deeply inside you, to make you find connections and links you wouldn't able to find normally...in a word, to induce a state of consciousness hopefully better than that you have usually. Relaxed, contemplative or full of positive energy, a real injection of life energy sometimes, it's up to you.   Let lose the ridiculous attempt to make electronics that you hear in the track that closes the album.  I think it's a sign of the times. Lots of mega production, loud noise to mask emptiness, the total absence of everything. So, I turn back to listen to my good old rock of the seventies, but also that really good of the 80s, both I think still would have much to teach, if someone really took note.     PS: my advice from the heart is for Aerial, by Kate Bush. It's really beautiful and unique. Something that should really stand the test of time.

B00006I53S|4.0|This lens is a good general all purpose lens.  It is an IS USM lens that has is not to big, or heavy.  The pictures are crisp and clear, but no where near the quailty of L-class.

B000060OFT|4.0|The first half of this movie completely blew me away - the vibrancy with which Shakespeare's story is retold completely captivated me in both it's visual appeal and choice of songs.  In particular, the camera work and music when the two lead characters first meet is perfect.  The second half of the film is by no means bad - it just lacks the same emotional grittiness of the first three acts and, by it's very nature, becomes a little too melodramatic.  John Leguizamo, Harold Perrineau (of 'Lost' fame), and Pete Postlethwaite all make truly commendable contributions.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Let me start by saying that by the time the film ended, I could hear my heart go \\"Phew\\" Between four of us friends, not a word was spoken for twenty odd minutes after the end. We didn't speak much about the film on that day and nothing was said. Now I shall start my ramble.<br /><br />One of the major strengths of Babel is how it not for one second assumes a superior tone than what the viewer is tuned into. In other words, the film is not patronizing and it doesn't really want to make a point (not only) or change lives. Babel manifests a solid storyline without much rabbling. Maybe the reason we were quiet was because we felt a \\"collective\\" respect for Babel. [and no the end is not like a demise]<br /><br />Two. The acting was not more than what was required. The screenplay doesn't allow for anyone to overact. I must give credit to whoever did the direction and screenplay. The storyline seems impossible to actually be molded into a 2hour 20 minute film, but IT WAS.<br /><br />Three. Though \\"Departed\\" is the best film I've seen this year and that film deserves an Oscar, Babel deserves more respect in my consciense.<br /><br />Four. Life-refreshing sets. You'll visit a cave, you'll see different countries you wish to escape to, you'll see bars, you'll see roof tops, you'll see hills, you'll see grasslands and country barns, you'll see petrol pumps, deserts, grasslands, buses, fountains... It just doesn't stop. It makes you feel like you're watching not just an American film but a discipline based on a world.<br /><br />And last. When Yussef cries out to the police, I...<br /><br />Babel is unique. It is something you don't even expect to watch in cinema. Within it's unanimity, you find a strange yet eternally concrete sense of belonging. Maybe you find hope if you're looking but it's just too beautiful an advent of heart to be shaped in mere words.<br /><br />You watch Babel.

B000AP04L0|5.0|This is the great movie that anyone who has ever worked in a corporate environment can relate to.

B00005NP20|5.0|This review refers to \\"Les Miserables\\" (region 2 edition)  <br /> <br />This 4 part production of \\"Les Miserable\\", that was televised, is magnificent.

Javert, the lawman intent on the capture of Valjean, comes alive in the form of one John Malkovich. It is directed by Josée Dayan,  and Valjean's feelings towards Cosette a more obvious romantic take. My French is limited, but I had no trouble getting swept away to the time, the place, the events, and with every emotion portrayed exquisitly by these intense actors. Charlotte Gainsbourg as Fantine, Virginie Ledoyen as Cosette, Christian Clavier and Veronica Ferres, as M. and Mme Thenardier, and Enrico Lo Verso as Marius add their remarkable portrayals as well.  <br /> <br />The DVD is formatted for Region 2 viewers.Check with the sellers for languages, subtitles and features. I have the Region 1 edition(French Only, ASIN: B0002VJIGY  ),an import from Canada, and there are 2 DVDs, each in their own snap case, with 2 parts of the 4 on each disc. Each disc running about 3 hours. The picture was very nice, clear, with good colors. There is a scene with Fantine in the cold stark streets, looking like death, and draped in a red shawl that took my breath away. There are some extra feautres on both discs(pertaining to Hugo, the story and the actors), but this may be a time when your French would come in handy, as they are all in the form of production notes, and all in Francais! I bought this new, and there were no inserts that came with it. The back of the box shows these DVD specifications: NTSC, Zones 1-6, Continent 2 DVD9.   <br /> <br />If you love this magnificent work by Victor Hugo, you MUST see this version. The performance is powerful!  <br /> <br />Merci Beaucoup....Laurie  <br /> <br />

0307237699|5.0|I haven't even read this book yet but I still have his voice ringing through my head. He'll make at least as great a president as Bill Clinton.  Sometimes I wonder if he's the second coming of Jesus. I wouldn't feel uncomfortable under a one world order with a 47% top tax rate if it was Barack running things, the man's got nothing but love respect and understanding for others, even those he disagrees with. Truely a man of his principles and unlike any democratic candidate to run =D
B000BM3ZUE|1.0|This is VERY IRRITATING as the Columbia versions, while sounding muddier, do not have these problems.<br /><br />\\"Acquiring the Taste\\" REPUK remaster has irritating clicks. \\"The House\\" 5:21 and 5:23. \\"Moon is Down\\" 2:40 and \\"Plain Truth\\" 3:48 and 4:31.<br /><br />\\"Octopus\\" also has these clicks noted under the respective customer reviews (Thanks Philip Schultz).<br /><br />REPUK must fix this and offer exchanges!! These albums are classics (5 stars normally).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is as good as any of the Star Trek series. I don't understand why they only made 14 episodes. I can only guess it was the Fox Network's usual bungling of time slot placement that killed it. They have done the same thing to other great shows like Dark Angel. (Do I sound bitter?) Anyway, I hope the producers of Firefly make another sequel to the movie, Serenity. All the characters are way to interesting to just let them float around out there.

B00009Y3L4|2.0|Cabaret is one of the great movie musicals of all time.  Unfortunately this DVD version, released in 2003 is misrepresented as a Widescreen format enhanced for Widescreen televisions.  It is not.  The Widescreen picture is \\"matted\\" and fills only a portion of the screen on newer HD sets.  Since there is no other version available, if you love the movie this is the only way to own it.  Shame on Warner Brothers for not releasing a classic like this with a pristine print that does the film justice.
0060899190|4.0|Love this book, love the project, love the website blog.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is such a quick read and then it is over and you still have the book around.  A great re-gift opportunity.

1400095913|5.0|It's not only the unusual story - a serial killer setting himself up as an instrument of vengeance against those who escape justice.  It's all those dialogues - Dexter and the audience, Dexter and Deborah and best of all, that inner dialogue between Dexter and his Dark visitor who dwells unbidden until those times it speaks, the almost dripping richness of the language.  In between the quirky humor and horrid scenes there are true insights that had me going &#34;Ahhh&#34;.  ***Warning ****  TV Spoilers for those who did not see the series.  The Micheal Hall television series has to be among the top new shows of the year - sheer perfection.  However, although Dexter seems to have walked right out of the pages of the book, it diverges in several areas. La Guerta is a sympathetic character on the show who is not killed. Doakes seems much darker and ominous in the book.  The whole episode of the &#34;ice truck&#34; killer was handled differently (and more successfully) on the tube. In fact, although the outcomes and plots were different, it seemed the more &#34;real&#34; of the two.  The story line was certainly more captivating - Deborah falling for the bad guy whose real interest is reuniting with his long-lost brother (the two do not resemble on television). My Grade - A++
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is the only Spielberg movie I will watch more than once; but, if Spielberg had never made another, this one would have been far more than enough to commend Spielberg forever.  This movie perfectly captures, in every conceivable way, the end pathos of an European self-destruction which began almost half a century before.  The movie's black and white message of reluctant personal redemption amid a frenzy of modern madness will make you feel insignificant.
0375413405|5.0|I received this book as a gift almost 30 years ago, when I was a bachelor simply trying to figure out which end of an egg is up! Now I am married with two grown kids and a fairly accomplished cook, having taking over those duties upon my retirement from the military.  I have 40 or 50 cookbooks, including Bon Apetit, Amer. Culinary Institute, and all the other classics.  But this Mastering the Art of French Cooking is number one on my list.  Every step of the way, this is first book I consult when trying to figure out the best way to cook something.  Buy it as a gift for an aspiring cook--it will be the cookbook they will refer to the most!

B0006J28BO|5.0|Another superb film from Ghibli, well worth watching.  Be sure to see \\"Whisper of the Heart\\" first.  A great soundtrack in this one, as usual for Ghibli.  Haru's 'flight' at the very end is one of the best culminations ever thought up for a story.  An authentic statement for the spirit, unlike the opposite sort of statement that infects most movies.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The Film is great. A real awakening and truely one of the scariest movies you will see. Al Gore does a terrific job and the movie keeps your attention and teaches you a lot. Any true movie reviewer would know \\"wikipedia\\" is not a respectful alternative to anything, let alone this fantastic film. <br /> <br />Do you and your friends and family a favor by seeing this movie and sharing it with everyone. You won't be dissapointed. Be prepared it's a documentary, not a blow em' up knock em' down action flick. So the people who most need to see this film, hicks living out in the country with big gas guzzling trucks and SUVs with horrible eating diets, probably won't. But if you can share it with anyone, do so. I forsee an Oscar!
1594200823|5.0|I know there are dozens of books published every year about this poor planet's problems. Stupid wars, intractable hatreds, global warming, diminishing resources, economic imbalance... it is hard to stay abreast of our concerns. Can you handle another one? Read The Omnivore's Dilemma. It is a magnificently written book that should appeal to farmers, grocers, cooks and diners. Michael Pollan investigates the sources of our food in America. His botanical approach is powerfully revealing. I grew up on a farm and still dabble in agriculture. I am ashamed to admit how much I didn't know about the presence and practice of industrial farming.  <br /> <br />Can the old fashioned, grass powered, diversified farm that recycles its wastes for maximum efficiency be restored? Clearly, we will not return to pre-WWII methods. But who would have predicted the growth of \\"organic\\" labels? The carefully managed , diversified farm such as Polyface in Virginia is a model for creating better soil, robust animals, more nutritious food and healthier people. Huge companies such as ADM and Cargill will not atrophy. But, they will adapt if consumers insist on quality. Very little research has been done as to the health benefits of naturally produced food. If a body of medical findings could be established to educate the public, we could well see a change in agricultural methods. Will my grandchildren think it hip to be farmers?
B000H4JGZY|5.0|Who knew I would actually end up liking this whole CD?  It took 6 <br />plays before it clicked, but now I really enjoy it in my car. It's  <br />one of those albums you can listen to all the way through over and <br />over and enjoy all the songs, not be bugged by one or two.  This <br />album is less about Justin as a singer, but more about the feel of <br />his *music* overall, which is just plain fun.  Great arrangements. <br />This album is destined to become a classic.  It's movin'! <br />

B00097DXZS|4.0|Santana has always put out a good CD, especially with these collaborations with other popular artists ... my gripe has to do with not being able to rip mp3's onto my PC, in order to make mp3 discs for my car audio mp3-capable disc changer - a very nice Chrysler feature (one mp3 disc holds approximately 13 audio discs ... very nice!) <br /> <br />I don't understand why, if you own a CD, you're not allowed to do with it, however you want - even if you were to have a portable mp3 player - the disc WON'T allow anything but WMA audio files through it's built-in software ... and it only allows THREE backups of the CD [I assume per PC used, hopefully] <br /> <br />this overly-sensitive copyright stuff is going way overboard; if you don't own the CD, then fine you shouldn't be allowed to do with it whatever you think of ... but I spent my money, which is highly taxed, yet then I cannot put the CD to use as I had hoped upon buying it ... it's my money, i own the CD, what's the problem? <br /> <br />back to the CD ... very nice tracks with Steven Tyler, Los Lonely Boys and Kirk Hammett / Robert Randolph - nice job again from Mr Santana!!
1582701709|1.0|This book is written for people who need instructions on how to live.  I'll tell you a better secret, and you don't have to pay me a dime: get a good education, work hard, and be nice to other people. Believe me, this book isn't going to help you by giving you some mumbo jumbo about positive thinking.
B000KG5THI|5.0|Just a quick note about what appears to be the same version of the album I bought from a retail store in San Francisco. I have the same version with the shiny sticker in the upper right-hand corner... and it only has 10 tracks, omitting the final song \\"Addicted\\".
B0000AKCLS|5.0|When I choose a Blues album, I consider the guitarist first, and the vocals are secondary. Joe has some of the best guitar chops in Blues today, and the man can actually sing and write! This album is currently #1 on my CD rotation list. If you like edgey Gibson/Les Paul Blues, then you'll love the sound of Joe Bonamassa. Besides the songs he wrote himself, his choice of song covers for his bonafide blues album compliment each other well. The musicians who accompany Joe on this album are first rate, and the production is excellent.
0385493622|4.0|This book is very readable, if for no other reason than to see a characterization of people who hunger for knowledge and are willing to go as far as necessary to satisfy that desire. It is not very clear from the book, but the man who proved the theorem (Andrew Wiles) invented lots of new, good math in his quest to solve this problem, and that is astounding in itself. What's impressive (of the book) is the way that it made math interesting. (Just on the strength of the storytelling ability of the author, I've purchased another of his books about Quantum Cryptography and not been disappointed.) This is also a book that you'll want to read a second (or third) time to make sure that you didn't miss any parts of the argument.<br /><br />Of course most of us won't understand the mathematics *all the way through* this book, but there are references to help anyone understand what he might wish to, for his personal enrichment.

B000LE1FAY|5.0|I have been a fan of Belinda Carlisle since her early days with the EVER-FABULOUS Go-Go's, the greatest female band there ever was. Her solo career was just as fabulous, and i did not mind waiting for 10 years for this new release. It was worth the wait, I trully enjoyed it, her voice fits every song, her french is just delicious! This is what i call 'High Quality' product. With all the trash that's out there today like Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson, thank God Madame Carlisle is still around. Wonderful CD!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|this si without a doubt the most moving of all the disney princess movies I've seen. The ending of this movie had me in tears. When i first saw this movie i though the beast really had died and it was too late for him and then it turned out that belle's love for the beast brought him back to life and broke the evil spell that was cast on him by the enchantress. the ending couldn't have been more perfect. I'm so glad to own the dvd. The picure and sound quality is perfect. I now have the entire princess collection on dvd. Thanks amazon for carrying these out of print titles!
B000KITI2I|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It is very useful and informative on the principled negotiation process where I learnt to separate people from the problem; focus on interests, not positions; generate a variety of options before deciding what to do and to insist that the result of negotiation be based on some objective standard. The authors took time to explain things in layman's terms without \\"dumping it down\\". I was delighted and impressed by the numerous practical examples the author gave which illustrated the vast opportunities that are available to achieve effective negotiations devoid of stubborn haggling but rather ensure mutual problem-solving.<br /><br />The book really gives a great launching point for those who wish to carry out successful win-win negotiations in every facet of their lives, be it at home, with suppliers, at your favourite shop or at work or even at national and international level. I love the tone that the book is written in and how it is easy to read, understand and follow, making a lot of sense.<br /><br />The author illustrates his arguments, proposals and solutions with practical examples which make the book very useful to the reader. His writing style is easy to understand so that any reader with a basic understanding of English can easily follow.<br /><br />The author methodically explores the negotiation process, highlighting the strategies and tactics that will help those involved to get the best out of the process. He stresses the need for avoiding negotiating over positions but rather focus on using the principled negotiation process which should leave everybody's interests taken care of. The book also describes the concept of BATNA, that is, the best alternative to a negotiated agreement or the lowest acceptable value to an individual for a negotiated agreement. Any offer that you receive that is higher than your BATNA is good and by the same token, you cannot expect the other party to accept an offer that is lower than their BATNA.<br /><br />I recommend the book to anyone interested in successful and fruitful negotiations.an their BATNA.  <br />  <br />I recommend the book to anyone interested in successful and fruitful negotiations. <br />
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I just recieved my copy of this dvd set and it was worth every penny and arrived quickly. It was beautifully remastered. It looks and sounds much better than my vhs copy.

0345404475|5.0|Great read to anybody that has any slight interest in this style of science fiction.
0143038419|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.   <br /> <br />I was at the Library looking for something to read and I came across this book a few times and never picked it up.  One day when I was in a hurry and needed to grab a book and go, I just took it after not being able to find anything else that looked interesting.   <br /> <br />This book seemed like it was what I wanted to do when I was 22 and therefore I did not think it would appeal to me since I am married with a child and have happily put my travel on hold for my wonderful family.  Wow, I was completely wrong.   <br /> <br />I loved reading this woman's story, her struggle to come to terms with who she is, how she will find happiness and her journey for meaning and self-discovery.  Anyone who has felt any sort of pain in life would be able to relate to her struggle to deal with it in her own life.  This book also spoke to me in terms of looking inward for happiness and not depending or blaming other people when it does or does not happen. <br /> <br />Bravo, Bravo, Bravo!!!!
B0000931QA|3.0|Musically, this is a wonderful album.  Everyone has already made that clear.  However, I have to address the \\"re\\"mastering job done on this CD.  One reviewer has already mentioned this awhile back, but I would just like to reiterate.  To be blunt, this album was remastered horribly.  Infact, it is probably the worst mastering job I have ever heard on anything, ever.  The fact that this would be allowed to be sold to the public is ridiculous.  If you listen to any of the tracks, especially during a part where any instrument is exposed, you will hear terrible digital clipping (distortion).  The reason for this is a careless mastering engineer who only cared about getting the loudest volume possible without regard for staying at or below digital 0db.  This was totally avoidable, as the music could still have been crushed to its loudest volume without introducing this digital clipping.  For a horrible example of the clipping on this cd, listen for any part where the choir is singing alone (I can't recall which  song) you will the worst digital clipping constant throughout the entire part.  With regards to this part, the mastering job ruins it entirely.  If you can get the original copy of this album, please do, it will be much more enjoyable on every level.
B00062IVKS|2.0|Deniro is one of the best actors of all time. Most all of Scorcese's films are jewels. But... <br />I couldn't get through this film in one sitting. An overdose. The script seemed ad-libed and overfull. It was boring. It was depressing from start to finish with no sense of salvation for any of the characters, nor did they deserve it.  <br />I bought the special edition and absolutely enjoyed the special features, though it won't drive me back to watch the film again.  <br />\\"Mean Streets\\" and \\"Taxi Driver\\" did the same thing to me,,so perhaps I'm peculiar.

0780622553|5.0|John Murdoch woke up in the bathtub, with no wallet, no memories and no idea what was going on.  Then he finds out he is wanted for a series of brutal murders.  Or is he?  Chased by the police, his wife and the Strangers, he slowly finds out the truth about the city, a city without any solid memories or even solid buildings.<br /><br />Dark City kind of reminded me of a detective movie at first it also started to make me think of the anime series Big O!  Rufus Sewell plays John Murdoch with the right amount of fear, anger and determination.  With the addition of the unbalanced doctor played by Kiefer Sutherland, the serious police detective played by the always powerful William Hurt and the confused wife played by the beautiful Jennifer Connelly this movie really has a powerful punch.
0743289684|5.0|Every now and then a book comes along to give my personal paradigms a good shake up.  \\"Infidel\\" is one such title. <br /> <br />I have admired Ayaan Hirsi Ali for some time - ever since I saw the first reports of her in Dutch politics and the shocking images of her subsequent film on the abuse of Muslim women. I admired her in her role as activist against the wrongs of radical Islam. (After all, Christianity has had its own ideological purge.) But my admiration was even more for the woman herself.   <br /> <br />As a white, middle-class female I am neither sociologist nor political animal, so why read this book, let alone comment on it?  Because I believe it has a powerful message for Western women besides a political one.  Certainly, the plight of Muslim women and the implications of burgeoning Islam concern me greatly. I cannot turn a blind eye, even in the isolation of New Zealand where I live. We have seen vandalism here against the mosques and been saddened by it.  We have bristled at the intractability of a visiting Imam when he was interviewed on national television on the abuse of Muslim women.  (As far as he was concerned, it didn't exist, and the Qu'ran did not sanction abuse.)  But this book does more than enlighten me on such issues: it shakes me out of the complacency of my own, relatively safe world.  And it leaves me with questions I had never thought of asking before.   <br /> <br />Gary Zukav (The Dancing Wu Li Masters) says, \\"According to quantum mechanics, there is no such thing as objectivity.  We cannot eliminate ourselves from the picture.\\"  So in what way do we put ourselves in this particular picture? <br /> <br />What can Western women do? Should we clean up our own backyard,first?  After all, women in Christian countries are no strangers to abuse.  Maybe if women's thinking internationally gets to \\"critical mass\\" on these issues, something will change radically. (I interpret part of Ali's message as saying this.) I admit I'm still looking for answers.   <br /> <br />All I can say to other women who consider reading this book is: do!  Ayaan Hirsi Ali shows that inner power is not dependent on outer circumstances.  The book is worth reading for that alone.
B000LE1FAY|1.0|This cd is the Titanic of Carlise's career and listening to it makes you want to walk the plank rather than wait for inevitable death by drowning.  I will say that the French pronunciation is surprisingly good but trying to make a Celion Dion record just don't cut the mustard.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I love the concept of a love unfolding through letters. Sandra Bullock plays a single doctor who has a void in her life and an unsure path for her future. Suddenly, a mysterious pen pal leaves her letters in the mailbox of her rental lake house. She finds herself falling for a man that she's never met and living two years apart! What she doesn't realize is that she has met him in her past and they are linked in a way she hasn't figured out until it's nearly too late. Will there ever be a time when the past catches up to the present and they can be together?<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This was the most fun, mesmorizing and exciting movie of 2007.  Unfortunately it didn't get nominated for best picture.  Edward Norton is phenominal as is Rufus Sewall and Paul Giamatti.  The Illusionist is also one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|One would think that this record might be a disappointment for the hardcore Beatles fan, largely because it rearranges songs that one knows by heart; will they still be as satisfying? The answer is yes. Plus there are some brilliant juxtapositions, like the drums from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" placed behind \\"Within You, Without You\\" that will re-awaken your awe of George Martin and renew your love of the Beatles.
B000BISBDY|5.0|It has been wonderful to rediscover the robust voice of Johnny Cash with this cd.  The first half of the cd makes you sing out loud with him and the second half is like a story book.  You can't go wrong with this one!
B000IU3XTW|4.0|This album is good, but if you don't have the rest of the Foo Fighters collection, get those first.  It is good, but the studio albums are the best.
1878424432|5.0|When you are ready to read this book, you will.  It is simple and profound.  I read this book last year, and then purchased it for no less than 5 people.  I hear Oprah bought a lot of these book as gifts for friends too. I would say this is a spiritual self-help book that makes common sense.  It is like a good movie that you can see over and over.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants inspiration and a clear path to better relationships.
B00018TI5E|5.0|Shadows is great and I think that John has a required taste type thing, I guess.  I think DC EP is amazing, so is the Will to Death.

I am not suprised that you don't like that much.  Save your money dude, go the red hot route if you want the best of john frusciante.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|I already had the DVD of \\"Forbidden Planet\\" Which kept me thinking if It would be worth getting the \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" It was worth every penny! Not to mention the other feature in the collection \\"The Invisible Boy\\" (also which I already had), But what I didn't have was the totally hip collector's Tin with great cover art, the lobby cards for both features, lost footage from the feature, and a 3.5\\" ROBBY the Robot and approx. 6hrs of restored and remastered footage. Also featured is a TV series episode of \\"The Thin Man\\"(\\"Robot Client\\"), 3 documentaries and a Science-Fiction Movie Trailer Gallery. I proudly display my Collectors Edition of \\"Forbidden Planet\\" I would definitely recommend this Edition to any and all Serious Collectors.

Although the author is a westerner, he presents an in-depth understanding of the subject matter.  Authentic recipes requiring some unusual ingredients aren't always easy to pull together --- may require online shopping if not available locally ---  but are delicious and are most definitely worth the effort.  Suggested menus are included for a full-course meal.  Careful explanation of ingredients is very helpful.  Beautiful book with vivid photography and well-written text.  A very worthwhile addition to your kitchen library.

B000LE1FAY|5.0|Like so many I have first of all been waiting a long time for a new CD and when I got word that she had a new CD on the way and it was all in French I was not happy. I am not closed minded I was just not sure what the outcome would be. Well let me say that this CD is the most imaginative CD to hit since the days Linda Ronstadt gave us What's New,  Belinda Carlisle gives her own take to all the songs and her take is very 2007 without being untrue to the songs.

B000083C49|5.0|Trekkies who are into the preservation of timeline and continuity probably had kittens when they watched this movie, but this movie worked because it highlighted the interplay of the cast - our favorite fictional characters.   <br /> <br />Any two bit sci-fi director can make a movie with spaceships and any bean counter can keep a timeline straight, but we don't watch Star Trek for these reasons, do we?  We watch them because only Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelly can play Kirk, Spock, and Bones.   <br /> <br />The scene where they're talking about Italian food in the pickup truck still makes me laugh today like the first time I saw it.
B0000009SG|5.0|Frank really hit his stride on this and the next album \\"Apostrophe\\".  He found his best guitar tone and the personel in this band gave him the ability to play anything he wanted to in any idiom ie. rock, hard rock,jazz,funk,and blues. These folks jammed!  I am old enough to say that I heard this band live on several occasions and they are fondly remembered as A top ten of the best live music I have ever heard. Recommended.

B000089J0R|4.0|Love them or hate them. The best or the worst. <br />That's usually how it goes with Dragonforce. Despite whatever people say, I think Dragonforce's first effort, Valley of the Damned, is a great effort.  <br /> <br />Valley of the Damned is THE song on this album. Everything else pales in comparison. In true Dragonforce style, the song is fast and the lyrics stay in the genre of fantasy. The outro to the song declines in speed, showing that the Li and Totman are indeed human.  <br /> <br />Other good songs off the CD are Black Fire, Starfire, and Black Winter Night. The track to avoid is Revelations. If you memorize Valley of the Damned and listen to Revelations, you can clearly see a strong resemblence. If I were to listen to Revelations without even hearing Valley, I would still say it's a mediocre song.  <br /> <br />If you like fast power metal with crazy guitar solos, then you'll enjoy Valley of the Damned. And if you're a true Dragonforce fan, you'll start to count how many times you hear \\"Over mountains high\\" in their songs...so far, I'm up to three.

B000JVT09C|5.0|Looks amazing in 1080p!  I can't get enough of Blu-ray!  It has several hours of very entertaining making of special features that any movie making fan and/or Brian Singer fan will love!    This movie is timeless cinema!  Superbly talented director, Brian Singer, once again made a great movie with class and real storytelling.    Brandon Routh was perfect as Superman and at times eerily reminiscent of Christopher Reeves. Great effects, actors, plot, and reminder that the world is fragile and we need a savior to put our faith in.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This film, along with Lawrence of Arabia, is my favorite of all time. I can't recommend it more highly. <br /> <br />The newly remastered Criterion edition lived up to all my standards and then some. The film looks incredible, a marked difference from the previous releases.   <br /> <br />In this film Kurosawa introduced me to one of my favorite actors, Toshiro Mifune. Mifune's performance in this film stays with you for weeks. <br /> <br />I can not think of a better duo than Kurosawa and Mifune.
B000002J2F|5.0|1980 - this album almost wasn't made.  After the 1978 tour collins got divorced & the group essentially broke up when he went to vancouver to reconcile his marriage.  Banks & rutherford each made their 1st solo albums in this time.  During his time in vancouver collins wrote material with a drum machine (please don't ask, misunderstanding, in the air tonight, others). Collins returned in late 1979 & they went into the studio & they had enough material for duke.  They went with 2/3 (not in the air...) & proceeded to record the entire album back tracked by drum machine.  The drum machine was actually inroduced to collins by rutherford.  Duke is an important album because collins became an important writer & arranger for the first time.  Until then it was banks & rutherford (post hackett/gabriel).  Also, the drum machine would become the back drop for recording & touring from then on.  The songs on this album are strong & consistent.  The duke suite opens the album showing a new, confident genesis showing a new direction opening the 80s with a new wave of fast muscicianship & strong vocals.  The yamaha electric piano really has a niche in this album.  Phil's drums are a little less aggressive letting the other guys stretch their legs & giving the music & production a little more balance.  Rutherford is finding more confidence as a bass/electric guitar player & is proving his chops.  Banks is moving away from his classical roots & finding a balance between progressive & pop patterns.  A very strong moment is guide vocal where only tony is playing piano & phil is singing.  It's an emotional piece showing how simplistic the band could be while still being complex & complete.  The duke's travels piece is very strong & closes the album showing the genesis fans (both old & new) that they had found new energy & direction.  This is the album that broke genesis in america & gave them their 1st #1 in the UK & top 10 in US.  The album is less progressive & more poppy but retainsthe main genesis characteristics - drama, strong vocals, drama, tempo changes, strong bass lines (though muted in this album) & strong keyboard sequences.  There are some good b-sides to this album including evidence of autumn.  The duke tour was also very intense & produced some great performances & some of the best vocal performances by collins.  This is a must for rock fans & contains 2 genesis classics turn it on again & misunderstanding.

B000E1YVZU|4.0|Seeing Rent on Broadway five times I was more than apprehensive about the transition-stage to screen....I found it better than I imagined and I wanted to add that after speaking with numerous people who only saw the movie,that they truly enjoyed the production of the motion picture and they had no point of reference at all to the show....I believe that RENT was so much better than I anticipated. The show unfortunately is becoming less effectiveand somewhat dated as we continue into the 2000's
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|If You've seen the Movie \\"Pride & Prejudice \\", like me, you were probibly struck by the breathtaking music pieces in this film. Haunting melodies that seem to have thier own drama within them. After viewing the movie and hearing the music I knew that this soundtrack could easily stand on it's own merit so I purchased it!   It is wonderful.  I have listened to this CD frequently and with the exception of a couple of boisterous tracks, is very soothing.  It is also interesting enough to not be fatigueing to listen to for several runs.  A great product if you enjoy light classical music.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I was a little leery when I heard this movie was about a \\"dysfunctional family.\\" Oh no! I thought I might meet one of the many movie families we've seen in recent years who bounce a series of contrived eccentricities off each other. But this movie turned out to be a wonderful surprise. <br /> <br />This was like eavesdropping on a real family, a family of real people who care about each other and who draw us into caring about them. As I was watching, I was reminded of the 1970's TV documentary featuring the Loud Family. In that pioneering reality programming, cameras were installed in a \\"typical\\" suburban home, and we viewers got to be flies on the wall as the Louds went through a series of anything-but-typical triumphs and tragedies. Coincidentally, the Director and Writer of  \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" mentioned the Loud documentary in their DVD commentary. They said their screen drama began to remind THEM of the Loud chronicle as they tweaked the script and got it on film. <br /> <br />Now, because of all the probing Dr. Phils and webcams everywhere, we can continuously eavesdrop on real life family drama. It's hard for any scripted drama to compete with all this reality. But I think \\"Sunshine\\" succeeds. It has the ring of truth; but it also has a satisfying dramatic arc. It captures what could be the plausible dynamics between family members as they, with all their diverse preoccupations, take to the road to get their little daughter to the spot she qualified for by default in a California beauty pageant.  <br /> <br />The only lapse in logic here is that none of these family members have foreknowledge of the kind of contest they are headed into. With all the notoriety surrounding the JonBenet Ramsey case, you would think everyone would be aware of what standards little girl beauty pageant contestants have to meet. But it seems all the members of this \\"Miss Sunshine\\" movie family are naïve on that score. They don't suspect that their youngest child may not be geared to project the right sort of precocious sex appeal. And there is a disconnect between the little girl's looks and the talent presentation that her grandfather coached her into preparing. <br /> <br />But this is a minor quibble. On the whole, I bought the premise and became engrossed. I rode along with this family in their clutch-challenged van through all their copings. And I was sorry when the ride was over. <br />  <br />
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I didn't know too much about Death Cab for Cutie except for the fact my once favorite show OC had them I believe on more than one of their soundtracks. I came across them when I was at my local library only a short few weeks ago and picked up Plans since I heard Soul Meets Body a few times on TV and found them very likeable. And I am a rather large fan of Keane, and countless times I was recommended to try Death Cab since they're supposedly similar artists (which I disagree with to a point; it's not fair to compare bands in my opinion anyway).  <br /> <br />I was blown away though with the other songs on here. No song lacks feeling on Plans and each song is unique in its own way. Brothers on a Hotel Bed and Marching Bands of Manhattan are especially favorites of mine; I find them the stand out tracks besides Soul Meets Body. Summer Skin though is becoming one of my favorites too- it had to grow on me a bit though. And I will not say all the songs are going to get to you on first listen, but the likeable sound keeps you listening; their sound is just very appealing. <br /> <br />This album is overall consistent, solid and not in any way a mess. The singer's voice is in no way grating and I find some of their rather catchy tracks stuck in my head an awful lot; many are just pretty and memorable.  <br /> <br />Definitely one of the best albums to come out lately. I guess some old fans of Death Cab aren't too thrilled of it, which makes me wonder how I personally will feel about their older albums. I plan on digging into their past though, and hopefully will like a good portion of their history as well. <br /> <br />What I like about this band is how they're not obnoxious, or loud or screaming for any type of attention that the top 40 are just chock full of. Refreshing to hear. Overall highly recommend. 4.5/5

B00001OH80|4.0|Of course I bought \\"Tonight\\" when it first came out, lo these many years ago, because of the smash (and deservedly so) hit, \\"Blue Jean\\". It was a phenomenon at the time. The extra-long video playing during an era when music TV stations actually played music videos, and so the album became mine. At the time I must have owned about 20-30 Bowie albums, having amassed quite the collection shortly after \\"Let's Dance\\" arrived a few years earlier. <br /> <br />And yes, as some reviewers here have also said, I was let down. But I played it. Over and over. I recall the same feeling when buying \\"Scary Monsters\\", and several other of Bowie's albums. <br /> <br />With each new album Bowie re-invents himself, and this one perhaps a bit moreso. Gone was the glam-rocker, and here was the lounge singer. But like most of his albums, he brings a bit of his own art to each of these songs. It's as if you walked into a night club in the 1950s and this guy was opening for Sinatra or something. But the more I listened, the more I began to really really love the haunting tones of Bowie's voice lent to some of these creamy lounge songs. <br /> <br />And now, some 20 years later, I find myself missing this album. I sold off my Bowie cassette collection years ago during a move. (No room for everything of course.) So I'm ordering this one again now. I can get one or two of the songs on his various \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums, but you may find, as I did, that this album is not something you can cut up and serve in pieces. It's best served whole.

B00004BZ16|4.0|\\"Sandinista!\\" is undoubtedly the Clash's most underappreciated and misunderstood album.  Issued as their fourth LP in the US, the disk was panned by many critics as undisciplined and unfocused, with many of the 36 tracks unpolished and a handful downright incoherent.  Guilty as charged, at least partially.  \\"Sandinista!\\" is still a brilliant album, with most of the excesses attributable to an explosion of creativity seldom seen.<br /><br />Coming off the \\"London Calling\\" double album, the Clash work most favorably recalled today, Mick Jones, Joe Strummer, Paul Simonon and Topper Headon tumbled headlong into a variety of musical styles and tastes.  Straight-ahead rock is leavened with ska, reggae and dub, Trinidadian steel drums, calypso, dance pop and nascent rap, `60s girl group vocals, old time Negro spiritual, soul and funk and whatever else caught their fancy.  The group worked long hours in the studio, rehearsing, noodling, brainstorming - and recording - just about everything.  Ultimately they ended up with more than enough material for two sides of a vinyl LP.  Determined to give the fans \\"value for money\\" and in fact engaged in a wasteful battle of wills with CBS/Epic over what the Clash perceived as loathsome promotion efforts, the boys insisted on releasing a 3-disk record featuring everything-but-the-kitchen-sink.<br /><br />The result is a \\"Sandinista!\\" that fans and critics initially (and understandably) found hard to digest, let alone embrace.  Twenty-some years later, however, the album remains as subversive and topical and rewarding as any ever made.  It is at once entertaining and thought provoking, disturbing and soothing, good natured and dour, confounding and brilliant.<br /><br />In opening number The Magnificent Seven, Joe Strummer raps to a bass-and-drums dance beat, spitting out such classic lines as, \\"What do we have for entertainment?  Cops kickin' gypsies on the pavement!\\" and \\"Wave bub-bub-bub-bye to the boss.  It's our profit, it's his loss.\\"  As the rhythm section propels the tune, an irresistible call and response chorus goes, \\"You lot!  What?  Don't stop, give it all you got.\\"  Hitsville UK prefigures Bananarama, featuring Mick Jones' girlfriend at the time, Ellen Foley.  In Something About England, an old street bum serves as the device to poignantly lament post-war England, the class system, and other social ills.  Somebody Got Murdered is a straight-ahead rocker.  As reported by Marcus Gray in his superb Clash biography \\"The Clash: Return of the Last Gang in Town\\", it was `commissioned' by the director of the Al Pacino movie \\"Cruising\\" - who never returned to claim his song!  It is immediately followed by One More Time, a reggae lament influenced by Jamaican DJ-songwriter-producer Mikey Dread, the lyrics a sharp depiction of ghetto poverty and violence.  (Mikey Dread would in fact heavily influence the album overall.)  An up-tempo romp, Lightning Strikes (Not Once but Twice) lightens the mood with some dance-funk fun.<br /><br />Mick Jones' joyful, rocking melody on Up in Heaven (Not Only Here) masks lyrics portraying the soul-crushing `towers of London', dreadfully bleak concrete high-rises thrown up by unimaginative city planners to house the post-war poor.  Later, Jones' earnest vocals on a cover of the Equals' Police on My Back (written by Eddy Grant) propel the desperate protagonist against a wall of siren-wailing guitars.  Effectively following on, the bounce ditty Midnight Log warns the listener, \\"Working for the devil, you'll have to pay his tax.  That means going to see him down among the racks...\\"  Later, on Kingston Advice a vocal chorus echoes a working class theme first established in The Magnificent Seven, the struggle for dignity and redemption amidst oppression, corporate and otherwise: \\"In these days nations are militant.  We have slavery under government.  In these days in the firmament, I look for signs that are permanent.\\"<br /><br />In the universal anti-war brood The Call Up, Joe pleads with his youthful listeners, \\"It's up to you not to heed the call up.  I don't wanna die!  It's up to you not to hear the call up.  I don't wanna kill!\\"  To Washington Bullets' steel drums and sunny island melody Joe laments America's (and England and Russia's) historic `interference' around the world.  Charlie Don't Surf pushes the point further, with a decidedly \\"Apocalypse Now\\" anti-Vietnam backdrop.  It is Strummer's closing shout of \\"Sandinista!\\" that produced the album's title and longest lasting cultural imprint.<br /><br />Another collaboration stands out: Lyrics penned and sung by Joe's eccentric folk singing pal Tymon Dogg, to a fiddling reel arranged by Mick, Lose This Skin is uplifting, chilling, beautiful, an altogether exhilarating song.<br /><br />Perhaps the best way to listen to this album is to edit it yourself, i.e. boil it down to a single coherent, more focused, digestible, and clearly themed album.  For example, I would open with Magnificent Seven, followed by Hitsville UK, Something About England, Rebel Waltz, Somebody Got Murdered, One More Time, Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice), Up in Heaven (Not Only Here), Police on My Back, Midnight Log, The Call Up, Washington Bullets, Lose This Skin, Charlie Don't Surf, and Kingston Advice.  I'd close with the rousing The Sound of the Sinners, in which Joe Strummer sings, \\"After all this time to believe in Jesus.  After all those drugs I thought I was him.  After all my lying and a-crying and my suffering, I ain't good enough, I ain't clean enough to be him.\\"  Powerful stuff and another good example why this is a great album.<br /><br />Once digested, go back and listen to the rest of the stuff.  But yes, Clash fans, I initially would skip Junco Partner, Joe's tongue in cheek anti-drug rap; Ivan Meets GI Joe, an effects laden disco ball groove; The Crooked Beat, Paul's follow-up to Guns of Brixton, which the others inexplicably turned into a reggae song - not at all what Paul intended; the Equaliser, a song type of which Joe did better many times over; the piano driven \\"Version City\\", and a half dozen others of lesser merit.<br /><br />A masterpiece?  No.  Is this the Clash's \\"White Album\\" or \\"Exile on Main Street\\"?  No.  It IS too long, too undisciplined and too unfocused to be called that.  If anything, \\"London Calling\\" may fit such a characterization.  But \\"Sandinista!\\" is still a great album nonetheless, capable of stunning the listener with its creative highs.  Soak it in and appreciate.  You'll listen to \\"Sandinista!\\" long after you've mined everything from other albums, Beatles to the Clash.eners, \\"It's up to you not to heed the call up.

B00005JLEJ|5.0|I INITIALLY BEGAN WATCHING THIS MOVIE AT 11:30 PM. I WAS VERY TIRED AND INTENDED TO WATCH ONLY THE FIRST 10 MINUTES OR SO. WOW, WHAT A SURPRISE. I DIDEN'T GO TO BED UNTIL 2:30 AM. IT'S IN JAPANESE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. THIS REALLY SETS THE MOOD. THE COSTUMES, THE ACTING, THE SUSPENSE, THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OF THE ACTORS, THE DRY HUMOR, THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS PERFECT. I FELT LIKE I STEPPED INTO A TIME MACHINE AND SPENT THREE HOURS IN OLD JAPAN.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Back in the 80s I watched a animated VHS movie rental called \\"Warriors of the Wind\\" with my moms 3 year old godsons. I was immediately impressed and bought the movie on VHS. Years passed and I searched high and low for it on DVD. Until now it was disheartening. This is basicly the same movie. Some will say that \\"Warriors on the Wind\\" wasn't anything like \\"Nausicaa\\" but I disagree. WOTW was indeed the heart of the story and the animation, characterizations, and music were incredible. So much so that even though I was in my early thirties when I first saw it, I knew I would never forget it. This is a wonderful animated story about a young ladies love for nature and animals. When a war threatens them she takes action to stop it. I highly recommend this as a purchase for the whole family. Great replayability.

B000KGGLCU|3.0|On par with the \\"Drowned World Tour\\" concert film that appeared on HBO - rather than the documentary-about-the-tour of \\"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\\" (from the \\"Re-Invention\\" tour) or the classic (and infamous) \\"Truth or Dare\\" (from the \\"Blonde Ambition\\" tour) - \\"The Confessions Tour\\" is an amazing concert, presented here on DVD with a CD comprised of several (live) performances from the concert. <br /> <br />THE CONFESSIONS TOUR is packaged in a flip-open three-panel cardboard case with glued-on plastic disc holders on two panels; booklet is glued to the remaining panel.  Booklet includes several artistic photos of the concert, as well as production, personnel (musicians, dancers, choreographers), crew, & song credits.  <br /> <br />The DVD of THE CONFESSIONS TOUR is a 1:57:00 concert (without credits); the 21 tracks consist of 19 songs performed by Madonna and 2 interludes/intermissions (\\"Confessions\\" and \\"Sorry (remix)\\") in which she does not appear or sing live.  The concert is presented in widescreen format and is not close captioned. <br /> <br />DVD extras: <br />[1] Je Suis L'Art (12 min): Consists of rehearsal footage and brief commentaries/interviews with tour director Jamie King, choreographer Anthony Talauega, and \\"Parkour\\" creator (acrobatic performance) Sebastien Foucan.  <br />[2] They're Naughty Children (0:01:30) short montage of the Confessions Tour dancers at work and at play. <br />[3] Rollerskating (0:01:30) short montage of the Confessions Tour dancers practicing their roller-skating routine for \\"Music Inferno\\" <br />[4] Photo Gallery (0:01:45) several photos of the concert (nothing extraordinary, impressive, or noteworthy) <br /> <br />The DVD version of the concert is both uncensored and longer than the version aired on NBC (and BRAVO) in 2006.  The songs \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\", \\"Paradise (Not for Me)\\" (in a quasi-acoustic set, both featuring Yitzhak \\"Isaac\\" Sinwani), and \\"Lucky Star\\", as well as the interlude/intermission \\"Sorry (Remix)\\" [two dancers dance to a dub version of the song] did not appear in the television special.  The version of \\"Live to Tell\\" shown is the \\"controversial\\" performance with Madonna on the mirrored (disco) cross.  The DVD version also includes more footage of Madonna addressing the audience, including a segment where she thanks her crew, band, dancers, and fans.  One of the best performances is \\"Like a Virgin\\", where after the opening number, a medley of \\"Future Lovers\\" and Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\", she sings her `80s hit while astride a carousel-style saddle in a performance which displays her flexibility and limberness.   <br /> <br />The CD of THE CONFESSIONS TOUR consists of 13 tracks, comprised on 11 songs sung by Madonna and two interludes/intermissions upon which she does not sing (tracks 4 and 7).  Total running time for disc is 73:14.  Included are the \\"Future Lovers/I Feel Love\\" medley, the updated version of \\"Like a Virgin\\", the previously unreleased version of \\"Erotica\\" also known as \\"You Thrill Me\\", and the percussion-based remixed version of \\"Let It Will Be\\", but I would have preferred the inclusion of \\"Drowned World\\" & \\"Paradise\\" and/or \\"Live to Tell\\" rather than the interludes.  One of these interludes precedes her rendition of \\"Music\\"; track 10, \\"Music Inferno\\" begins with \\"The Duck Mixes the Hits\\", a brief montage of snippets from \\"Borderline\\", \\"Erotica\\", \\"Dress You Up\\", \\"Holiday\\", and \\"Disco Inferno\\" (played as if heard on a radio dial), then during the instrumental of the `70s track (with recorded snippets of \\"Where's the Party\\" chorus repeated) the dancers perform their roller-skating routine; Madonna sings \\"Music\\" to the music of \\"Disco Inferno\\" about 3:30 into it.  There are no credits given for the \\"Confessions\\" interlude; it may or may not be the dancers' voices giving the spoken-word/dialog; writing credits for these dialogs are not provided either.   <br /> <br />While I wish there was more backstage and making-off footage or other extras (more interviews and footage of her dancers would have been great), I think this is a solid release.  The concert was well choreographed and designed and the filming of it was well edited.  This is a must-have for Madonna fans.  <br /> <br />
B000002J6F|4.0|early 70's country/folk/rock is anathema to some, i understand. but i don't know why this is so. what's wrong with beautiful songwriting and song execution? this is an extremely satisfying album for the ears. a wide range of moods and textures are covered over the course of the recording without a false step along the way. i highly recommend this for all fans of country-rock.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I love this album.  I'm not going to go into details on why it's so good musically.  In simple terms, it's a very soothing, mellow album.  When I'm in a frenzy or frustrated mood, I can put on this album and it calms me down.  Great music, great voice, period.
B000002KCV|4.0|this is a somewhat neglected album from neil young that is among his strongest overall sets. except for the rocking \\"motorcycle mama,\\" this is a gentle cycle of songs, laid-back and pleasing in its entirety. if you are a neil young fan and don't yet have this, get it quick. if you have no neil young cds (really?) this is a fine place to start digging his quieter side.

B00005JKQZ|3.0|The best part of the film were when the leading character was delusional. That's not a good basis for a film to grow off of, especially when sanity brings the viewer a happy boring ending. There was no real romance to speak of, instead the idea of exchanging bodily fluids and skipping any small talk prevailed. The director Ron Howard reaffirms that he does not know how to craft love stories.    I did not find the characters to be believable as portrayed. The acting by Russell Crowe was horrific. The phoniness of his stammering accent reminds me of having sticky fingers. You can't get rid of it and the longer it goes on the more annonying it gets. His wife lacked any character development. She is similar to an immovable pillar which remains in the same spot and the same shape less some aging. I can hear Crowe's character saying, \\"that's a good wife, now stand over there and cry when I get all the accolade.\\"     The makeup showing the aging of characters appeared planned and formulated. It was great the first dozen movies we saw it but now it doesn't work. I found myself successfully guessing where the plastic pieces were applied to the faces. There wasn't much else to do as I was completely bored waiting for the credits to roll finally releasing me from this yawner.     I will give the movie 3 stars. It was average at best. The editing, soundtrack and portrayal by some supporing actors were the only things saving it from a lower score. Wait for it to appear on TV. This movie won 4 academy awards. It is a terrible example of 'excellence' in film.
B000M06K5C|3.0|I have to start by saying that on my initial listen through, I, like some others, am a bit disappointed with the new album. I have to say though, I was expecting to feel that way. First because when I initially listened to Silent Alarm I wasn't a big fan. Six months later, I gave it another chance and became obsessed with it - I listened to it almost every day, several times a day for months. Second, when you start out with such an incredible album like Silent Alarm, the expectations are super-high and it's easy for fans to be let down. I had a feeling that if I left my expectations be too high, I wouldn't give the album a chance. <br /> <br />So far I'm not loving this one but I'm also not hating it. I can tell that it won't ever be as powerful or exciting for me as Silent Alarm. There are definitely a few songs that I am already looking forward to hearing again but there's also a few that I wanted to completely pass over. My advice is to be open-minded and to give it a chance. And if you're disappointed, just keep listening to Silent Alarm until the next one comes out and hope that it's better.
B000E1MTY0|4.0|this is one of the best of the batman movie series.  it is always nice to watch one of the \\"beginning\\" movies to get the full story of a character.  the special effects are very good in this movie and i quite enjoyed them.  i would recommend this DVD to add to your library.
B00005JOLI|3.0|Am I ever glad I saw the movie before reading the book. While this movie is fun, it is clearly hurried, and the only character you have time to care about is Saphira. This is not surprising when you try to cram 500 pages into an hour and a half. As I am so used to the usual cliches that I long to see them shattered on ocassion, I spent more trouble thinking about what trouble Eragon was getting into while he got to whichever cliche needed to be addressed. Only the Urgals looked like another race, and even they barely did so. Durza didn't look demonic, he just looked like he had bad dental hygiene, which is not surprising given a middle ages fantasy world. Overall, the rushed feeling of the film, and the ability to identify with only one character are what cost this movie two stars.

B000MXPE7O|5.0|Like the ending of DeNiro's crazed protagonist,Travis Bickel in \\"Taxi Driver\\", this is a great, multilayered movie which portrays events but doesn't explain itself. And Yes, it is quite slowly paced.<br /><br />The plot is really a re-do of John LeCarre's \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\". It deals with the transformation of the OSS to the CIA. Like George Smiley in \\"Tinker, Tailor\\", there is a Commie mole, and the deep-thinking but stoic, silent, Wilson goes back and forth in history trying to determine who, what happened and how.<br /><br />Director DeNiro does NOT tell the viewer what is going on in Wilson's (Matt Damon) head. You need to figure that out, so viewers looking for a James Bond spy story with action and car chases will be disappointed. While fiction, some characters are based in fact, the Matt Damon character is a lot like James Jesus Angleton and the DeNiro, himself, plays the military guy who sets him up, Wild Bill Donovan, real people.<br /><br />Secretive and clever Edmund Wilson goes from the upper class to Yale to the OSS in WWII, to the Director of Ops, the CIA master of disinformation, trying to confuse the communists for US strategic advantages. In the end he becomes emotionally frozen, can trust no one and he come to realize he has been betrayed over and over again, by everyone he trusts.<br /><br />DeNiro talked a great deal with his mentor Martin Scorcese while making this movie.<br /><br />Go see or buy this very subtle movie which is open to much potential interpretation. Both spycraft and the paranoia inherent in working for the CIA are portrayed very accurately here, for a change. I could swear parts of this are actually shot at Langley, even inside. Highly recommended. This movie should have been a nominee for Best Picture of the Year & Best Actor.<br /><br />The real Wild Bill Donovan once said, \\"Espionage is not a nice thing, nor are the methods employed exemplary. Neither are demolition bombs nor poison gas... ...We face an enemy who believes one of his chief weapons is that none but he will employ terror. But we will turn terror against him...\\"<br /><br />***Plot spoiler hint****don't read this til after you see the movie.

B00005V9HH|5.0|The Usual Suspects is 1995's fantastic mystery/thriller directed by Brian Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie.  It stars Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollack as Todd Hockney, and Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint, five ex-cons pulled together for a line up for a NY York truck hijacking investigation.  The film won two Oscars, one for McQuarrie's original screenplay and one for Spacey's brilliant performance as a supporting actor in the role of Verbal Kint. <br /> <br />The movie starts at the end with Dean Keaton being shot on a boat in San Pedro, CA, by a mysterious character named Keysor Sose, and from there skips back and forth between the past and present as the police investigate the fire and mayhem that occurred on the boat resulting in the loss of 27 lives.  The only survivors are a badly burned and comatose Hungarian sailor and the crippled Verbal Kint, who has gotten immunity for his testimony in what happened between the line-up and the boat disaster in California six weeks later. <br /> <br />Without ruining the plot, let me just say we are introduced to the idea of Keyser Sose as some sort of mystical uber-criminal who had manipulated the gang from the very beginning to end up dead on the boat in California.  The end of the film is one of the most stunning endings in the history of Hollywood, and there are to this day, huge arguments about it.  I'm not going to spoil it here with my conjectures, you'll just have to watch the movie. <br /> <br />The cinematography was really nothing to write home about, pretty standard stuff for the most part.  The score was unobtrusive.  The story is what drives this film and makes it special.  And the actors were well chosen to run with the story.  The five guys that play the ex-cons do a fantastic job.  Also I really enjoyed Chazz Palminteri's portrayal of US Customs agent Dave Kujan, and Pete Postlewaite's portrayal of Keyser Sose's lawyerKobayashi.  The acting in this movie was truly first rate. <br /> <br />Although the gang starts out avoiding violence, the film does become very violent.  It's rated R for a reason.  Some people may be uncomfortable with the level of violence in the movie.  But even so, it's one of the best mystery/thrillers I've ever seen.  The ending just can't be adequately described in words.
0743289684|5.0|The contents of \\"Infidel\\" are well outlined in the above Washington Post review. I will confine myself to my impressions of the book and author.<br /><br />This is a momentous work, written by one of the brighter spirits of our day. Already a best-seller in Europe, I'm sure it will receive an enthusiastic audience in America (as did her first work of a year ago: \\"Caged Virgin: An Emancipation Proclamation for Women and Islam\\").<br /><br />First and foremost \\"Infidel\\" is a gripping autobiography of struggle, survival and eventual triumph against the tyranny of Islam. Islamic ideology is totalitarian, regulating every moment of its subject's life, including such trivial things as which foot to use first when stepping into and out of the bathroom.<br /><br />Also the work is a significant contribution to the social sciences; to cultural anthropology, history, economics, political science and both comparative religion and the sociology of religion. It is the definitive refutation of multi-culturalism.<br /><br />But perhaps most of all this is a first rate work of literature. It stands as an outstanding dramatic creation in its own right. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a gifted writer whose life was indeed the suspenseful drama she has produced; a page-turner that keeps you wondering how all the problems and conflicts will be resolved. The characters, locales and events are vividly drawn with the sure hand of a natural story-teller.<br /><br />Ms. Ali does not shy away from relating the most intimate details of her life. She handles this perfectly, as only a person of great character can; she draws the reader intimately close while simultaneously keeping herself at a proper distance. She never sentimentalizes or indulges in self-pity. Her revelations are an essential part of her story and her message.<br /><br />Ayaan Hirsi Ali has been destined to embody in her person the political and religious crises that rack our time. This is a great burden to bear. She has already proven that she has the inner strength and the mental clarity for the job. I look forward with anticipation to her next work.clarity for the job. I look forward with anticipation to her next work.
B000059Z8J|5.0|A great movie from start to finish, with great acting, photography, and an outstanding score!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|The first few times I heard this album, I did not really like it....it was cheesy, melodramatic (very Springsteen), and I didn't think the melodies were that great. <br /> <br />However, the more you listen to this album, the more you realize its greatness.  Most of the songs increase dramatically in energy from start to finish, eventually ending in a frenetic, passionate (but very melodic) crescendo, as the last reviewer mentioned. <br /> <br />My opinion of the album has shifted so much...I used to think the songs were hammy and overwrought...I realize now that they're actually quite subtle, but it takes time to understand that. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks: All of them are great, but my personal favorites are \\"Neighborhood #3\\" (the only song I liked upon first listen, and without doubt the core of the album), \\"Crown of Love\\" (nice waltzy pace, with a fantastic violin outro), and \\"Rebellion/Lies\\" (just an all around great track). <br /> <br />And if you've not seen them live, then you haven't seen anything yet.  Win Butler is insane.

B000H5V8DG|4.0|I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but I'll give my opinion of it. \\"Alias\\" is probably one of my five favorite shows of all time. This along with \\"Buffy,\\" \\"Gilmore Girls,\\" \\"Friends,\\" and \\"Lost.\\" I knew I would be watching this show since I saw the series premiere trailer in summer 2001. I have to say that I was sad when the show ended last year because I thought that it could have gone on for at least one more year to IMO properly wrap up the Rambaldi mystery. But the show ended on a happy note and fans like myself got the happy ending treatment. <br /> <br />I think that the packaging for this box set is genius. I like how the Rambaldi box is the theme. The only thing that I do not like is how the discs are packaged. I feel like that I am going to scratch a disc whenever I pull it out of its envelope. I'd rather that they were fastened on the normal plastic backing. I do like the fact that this box set only has 40,000 copies. I liked the 29th disc \\"Endgame.\\" Overall this is a good item for all \\"Alias\\" fans.

B00005JPGO|5.0|Who knew something so beautiful comes with such an ugly history behind it. The simple diamond has become director Ed Zwick's latest interest, and here he explores this rock in such depth and detail, it is both amazing and scary. One thing is for sure, I will never look at diamonds the same way. <br /> <br />Danny Archer is a diamond smuggler, a Rhodesian who has ties to some large corporations, like Van De Kaap. Soloman Vandy is a fisherman from a local village that is pillaged by rebels R.U.F. who are at civil war vying for diamond fields. Danny gets caught by the local government trying to smuggle diamonds out of Africa and is put in jail. Soloman is separated from his family during the destruction of his village, and the rebels take him in to help them harvest diamonds. He comes upon a pink diamond, a large rock, one of the rarest in the world. Soon after, while struggling with Captain Poison, a rebel leader who finds out about the diamond, the rebel camp is attacked by the government's military unit and he is forced to bury the diamond. With a twist of fate, he ends up in the same prison where Danny is. Danny finds out about the diamond, and in a bid to repay what he lost when he was caught, and also to get out of Africa, he arranges to get Soloman out of prison and engage his help to find the diamond. In return, he promises Soloman to help locate his family. At around the same time, Danny also meets Maddy, a journalist who aspires to uncover the truth about conflict diamonds, that these diamonds reach the shores of countries like the U.S or England, and that large corporations are hiding that fact. Danny agrees to help her, if she would use her influence as a journalist to find Soloman's family. \\"Yes, I am using him and you are using me, and that's how it goes,\\" Danny says. The story ensues... <br /> <br />The story, while totally riveting in it's delivery, never clouds the backbone of this movie, the illegal mining of these conflict diamonds, and its effects on the country and the people. Back when this story was set, I was still a teenager and oblivious to these issues. I'm guessing many adults were, too. I read many reviews criticizing Blood Diamond, saying that it felt like a documentary. Isn't that a compliment? To be able to provoke some sort of emotion upon viewing the horrifying acts of man for money and power. To watch young children recruited by the rebels to kill, trained to have no conscience whatsoever. It is really sad to think that all these was happening just a few years ago, and probably still is, although not as much. Your heart goes out to these people who have been enslaved and tortured. One character says \\"Thank God they did not find oil.\\" <br /> <br />The acting is top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a consistently great performance in every movie he's in and it's no exception here. He is unflinching as the ruthless Danny Archer. Definitely not playing to the usual hero mold, he is never really the good guy throughout the movie, even in the end his moral obligation is somewhat questionable. He always has an ulterior motive. The only times we see his vulnerabilities is when he is talking with Maddy. One of my favorite lines from the movie is uttered here. \\"Sometimes I wonder if God will ever forgive us for what we've done to each other...then I look around and I realize, God left this place a long time ago.\\" Delivered with such emotion that it simply grabs you. A well deserved Oscar nomination for his role here. Another great actor is Djimon Honsou, playing Soloman Vandy. Soloman is a simple man, a family-oriented guy who cares about nothing else but his family. He is naive in a sense and when his family is taken, you can feel the grief in him. He is overwhelmed with what is happening around him. Where Danny blends perfectly with this environment, Soloman seems struggling to apprehend it. And Jennifer Connelly plays the journalist, Maddy Bowen. Maddy has a great intensity to know the real story behind this industry, but we, the audience are always left questioning, will that knowledge change anything? She certainly feels it will and is unwavering in her mission to find out. Danny and Maddy had some great chemistry, and ultimately that connection between them plays a vital role in the end of the movie.  <br /> <br />Other than this, many other factors contribute to the success of this movie. The cinematography is brilliant. It depicts the civil war to an amazing level of realism. The music was also fantastic, infusing native sounds with orchestral elements to create a sweeping score of epic proportions. I am also eagerly anticipating this 2-disc DVD set, particularly because I am very interested to see how Ed Zwick delved into this industry, how he researched blood diamonds, the smuggling of this rocks, the people behind it, the wars and how the actors themselves prepared for the roles. <br /> <br />In the end, the true power of this movie transcends what can be seen on the screen. It really is more about what is felt upon watching this movie. Sure, finally everything is tied up with a nice little bow, but the movie claims that civil unrest still exists in the nation of Africa. Parts of the problem are resolved, but for every solution, there is a new problem creeping up. Ultimately, I'm guessing that this movie was not made with the idea of finding a resolution to the wars, but I think for it to even make us think about the consequences of buying conflict diamonds, to give us a \\"pang\\" of realization what occurs behind the scenes of how these magnificent jewels are obtained is a huge success in itself. And it certainly did do exactly that for me. Powerful, compelling and real would be some of the words I would choose to describe this awe-inspiring movie. A superb effort and one the best pictures I have seen. Wholeheartedly recommended.
B000J233SK|5.0|Who would not want to read a book of secrets...Except, this is one you listen to.<br /><br />\\"The journey not the destination, becomes a source of wonder.\\"<br /><br />Loreena McKennitt spent a few years thinking about Celtic nomadic ways. She wondered if this need arose from an insatiable curiosity. She set off to travel to Rome and ended up in Istanbul. She set off for Japan and ended up on a train across Siberia. The CD booklet, is interesting to read as you listen and reveals her sources of inspiration. Of course after reading the booklet, you might feel compelled to go off on your own journey<br /><br />The songs on this album are all a reflection of Loreena's knowledge of the world. She seems to be seeking, exploring possibilities and expressing what she has captured.<br /><br />1. Prologue - inspired by \\"From The Holy Mountain\\" by William Dalrymple. There is a certain emptiness and remorse woven into this piece. Maybe a longing for what could have been. You can almost imagine monks traveling from monastery to monastery to collect ancient wisdom.<br /><br />2. The Mummers' Dance - Loreena incorporated the chorus of a traditional mumming song and her words take on new meaning when you realize that mumming involves a group of performers who dress up in masks and clothes bedecked with ribbons and carrying branches of greenery. This \\"mumming\\" has its roots in tree worshiping, which will make you consider why you bring a tree in at Christmas time, at least it is worth considering. Although I think people are more interested in worshipping materialism at the malls.<br /><br />3. Skellig - this song becomes almost hypnotic as it seems to spin in circles or maybe it is more like the flicker of a candle that grows brighter as you approach it on a dark night.<br /><br />4. Marco Polo - Loreena has interwoven an authentic Sulfi melody at the beginning and middle of this piece. It is rather intoxicating.<br /><br />5. The Highwayman - friends suggested setting Alfred Noyes' poem \\"The Highwayman\\" to music. While in the studio, Loreena imagined the sound of horses galloping down a moonlit lane. Best to listen to this song while reading the lyrics, which are included and paint a tragic tale even more dramatically in song.<br /><br />6. La Serenissima - Delicate and haunting.<br /><br />7. Night Ride Across the Caucasus - the notes explain how people are affected by music and either hear the spiritual meaning or the material sound.<br /><br />\\"In the velvet of the darkness<br /><br />By the silhouette of silent trees<br /><br />They are watching, they are waiting<br /><br />They are witnessing life's mysteries.\\"<br /><br />8. Dante's Prayer - inspired by Dante's The Divine Comedy (a vernacular poem in 100 cantos), Loreena thinks about the human condition and how we all want to believe there is a place better than our own. An almost sorrowful and yet hopeful melody. Italian poet, Dante (1265-1321) gave an explanation of what happens after we die and this question is still just as controversial today.<br /><br />Perhaps she was inspired by: \\"Temo di perder viver tra coloro, che questo tempo chiameranno Antico.\\" (I fear I will lose life among those who will call this time ancient.\\" She sings \\"Please remember me.\\" She also speaks of \\"Beyond the ice and the fire.\\" The innermost pit of hell is for Dante, ice. The dark woods implies the present state of mankind and when you think about this while listening, the words suddenly become more meaningful.<br /><br />I found this CD to be an expression of continuing knowledge. Knowledge from the past flows through Loreena McKennitt's consciousness and turns into music. It is an evolution of travel and contemplation.

B000K4WPCC|3.0|Not an awful movie.  The effects were a little repeated from the Underworld movie but didn't detract from the overall picture.  Did a small amount of stealing from the movie Lost Boys too, but only someone who obsessed over that movie as a pre-teen would know that. <br /> <br />It definitely doesn't have adults in mind. But has a high repeat watchablity factor. Unlike others who didn't like this movie, I got exactly what I expected and was pleased.    <br /> <br />BTW, what is with all the perspiration??  Having powers must make you leaky.  OR...it wasn't apart of the movie but a result of the steroid abuse (I saw those shoulder stretch marks They can't deny it)

The writing is strong, the illustrations new with a flair of the Victorian (well suited for Victorian-aged writers and their created characters), the dialogue doesn't mince and the action is fast-paced. <br /> <br />Anyone who enjoys literature like Burroughs' John Carter of Mars, the early Sci-Fi writers like Wells and Verne and Gothic tales of visceral violence like Dracula or even R. E. Howard's Conan would do themselves a favor to read this! it is a definitive homage, imho, to all those who came before as well as a tip-of-the-hat to the early days of pulp and comics. <br /> <br />This is some of the best in the comics industry to date.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|An odd young man, who collects family momentos in plastic baggies, travels to the Ukraine for a Jewish heritage tour.  He seeks answers about who was the woman in the photo with his grandfather standing in the Ukrainian wheat field in 1942?<br />Serving as his translator on the road trip across the Ukraine is a glib young man who often mangles English.  The translator's grandfather, a taciturn character, drives them.  The grandfather's insane dog livens up the trip.<br />The viewer is often left wondering (what did he say? what did that mean?) but hangs on for the ride.  There is humor, pathos, history, ethnic music and hiphop and glorious scenery to enjoy along the way.  Eventually the role of the Ukrainian grandfather becomes clear and the ways their lives touch and blend ends the movie in a sad but illuminating way.
038572179X|4.0|I have to admit that I tried to read Atonement about a year ago and ended up putting it down.  I just couldn't get into it.  Perhaps times have changed for me, because when I picked it up recently to give it one more try, I just couldn't put it down. <br />My previous experience with Ian MacEwan was 'Amsterdam'.  I remember that in that novel I really enjoyed the way he used language and the way he flushed out the psychology of his characters.  In this novel, those skills are still on display, but to a much greater extent.  The length and breadth of this novel give him more room and opportunity to flush out his characters even more fully and to continue to display his powerful use of language. <br />I had remained largely unspoiled before reading this novel.  However, I still was able to see the writing on the wall.  I didn't want to keep reading this novel to find out what the big reveal was - that was fairly clear at various points along the way.  However, I did want to keep reading this novel to find out how McEwan was going to get to that end.  The psychology and interplay of the characters was really fascinating to read, especially as the war-time years and beyond were reached.   <br />I loved the clear pictures he was able to give of the war - the soldier's view, the nurse's view, the aftermath.  Really this book was so many stories in one.  If you enjoy novels with a war-time theme, novels that delve into the psychology and drive of their characters, and ultimately novels of redemption, you will find great enjoyment in 'Atonement'.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|OK movie with very good performances by Smith and his son. The scene with both of them sleeping in the subway's restroom is more than enough to have made Smith Oscar-nomination worthy.  Only complaint (spoiler warning !): it makes us go through 2 hours of pain & heartbreak while rewarding it with what felt like only a couple of minutes of happiness & redemption.

0140074317|5.0|I loved the movie as a kid so when I saw this book on Amazon, I thought it would be a fun read.  Turns out that the movie is barely the first half of the book, and the book is better without comparison (Atreyu's horse talks in the book - how cool is that!).  I had trouble putting the book down.  My only disappointment is that my favorite part of the movie (when the giant says \\"they look like big, strong hands don't they?\\") isn't in the book. <br />Atreyu and Falkor remain essential characters in the book.  They are the moral standard - the perfect friends.  Bastian goes through a learning process, and the reader does too.  My favorite aspects: Atreyu's conversation with Gmork, the emphasis on friendship, the Desert of Colors, the ambivalence of the child-like empress. <br />This book made me think and made me remember that it is okay to dream.  Who can argue with that?

Very good story - excellent acting throughout so please don't make us wait too long before film 2.
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|I generally only read books by African American authors, but I was captured by the cover of \\"Lovely Bones\\" with the little house dangling from the bracelet. When I read the back of it I said \\"now how would reading about the disappearance and death of a young girl be a good read?\\" I bought it because I wanted to see someone else's perception of looking down at the world from heaven. Once I started reading this book I couldn't stop. It's so well written and very touching, especially at the end when she finally makes the connection with her family on earth and they can finally feel her in the room with them. I cried...

B000M4RG42|3.0|Separating entertainment from history will be the toughest thing to do during this little film review, but we're going to do it because entertainment is what films are all about, right? Whether it's entertaining in a teaching manner or on a more visceral level is up to the director/screenwriter. But as the audience, our only need is to feel as though our time sitting in front of the big screen has been worthwhile.<br /><br />Some are going to lambaste me for saying things here but I'm going to risk ridicule and say them anyway. But first, the positives...<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent. The muted sepia tones on Iwo Jima and the flashbacks that all the characters have are all pulled off exceptionally well. Also, the story is significant in that the \\"true\\" heroes of Iwo Jima are never recognized, and Mr. Eastwood deserves thanks for pointing out this historical flaw. The sweeping views of the American Navy as it approaches Iwo are just flat-out stunning, too, reminiscent of the scenes from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (although that landing took place in France, not the Pacific Theater).<br /><br />Historically the story is very interesting, too, showing how Americans went bonkers over one image that they viewed as the U.S.'s ultimate success in the war. The media and politicians appropriately locked onto this and used it to help promote the sale of war bonds. And this is where our characters come in ...and where we start to run into problems.<br /><br />With the exception of Ira Hayes (played well by Adam Beach) and maybe John \\"Doc\\" Bradley (played by Ryan Phillippe), the characters in the film are distantly portrayed, never really getting the audience on the inside of the rest of the main characters. Barry Pepper (who I absolutely love as an actor) was one of the many die-offs that I just couldn't connect with. As were Jesse Bradford (although not a die-off), John Benjamin Hickey, and even Paul Walker (who played Hank Hansen, a fairly pivotal person in the story). I realize that these were real men, not fictional creations, but the audience still needs a significant connection in order to empathize with them. It just wasn't there. Again, the exception to this was Adam Beach who's well-played role of the unfortunate Ira Hayes comes off quite well. His unfortunate death proves that Native Americans were seen as second class citizens even though they were fighting in the war and killed alongside every other color of men.<br /><br />Perhaps LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is a better Eastwood film. Maybe not. Regardless, I'm now just a bit hesitant to see it for fear of not connecting with any of those characters either.the story).

B000HCO83G|5.0|Better than the comic books. The \\"real thing\\" always is!
6304602979|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie!  If you're a Tarantino fan and you haven't seen this movie, all I can say is WHY NOT?!?  I won't go through the whole story, but suffice it to say that it's an all-star cast, a great story, and a romance movie that guys can totally enjoy too!  Not sure what this says about me, but I do think Clarence and Alabama's relationship is the ultimate romance - one I aspire too!  ; )  And Gary Oldman should have won an Academy Award for his performance as Alabama's pimp!  Definitely one worth having in the DVD library!
B000002H33|5.0|This is Metallica at its finest. Simply put, I already knew of the amazing songs on this CD. But I had never purchased it. It was only 10$ So why not? This truly is one of my favorite metal CDs of all time. All 8 songs are classic. This came out in 1986..think about it, for its time its even more incredible. Pick this one up. You wont regret it.
B000002AGE|1.0|With great anticipation, I purchased this CD but it came in some obscure \\"Super Audio CD\\" format by Sony. It is unplayable on my CD player and unreadable on my laptop. The Amazon product description does not designate this. Bummer. Now I have to go through some return/replace hassle.
B00005JG6Q|3.0|This has been a point of contention since its re-release, but I'll fight this one until the end of the Earth.  For the most part, it seems that whichever version you saw FIRST is the one you like.  This is the movie that got me into anime and it will always be on my top-5 list (with the original dub).  I would give the original 4.5 stars, but this one just didn't work for me.  I watched all the \\"behind the scenes\\" stuff and I know the new voice actors really put their all into this, but very little sounded genuie to me.  Not only that, but they redubbed the movie in order to make it more similar to the japanese dialogue.  This always leads to problems.  There is one line that really sticks in my head - in the original dub, Kay tells Tetsuo \\"You must not abuse the powers you've been given,\\" but in the redub she says \\"the way in which you are using your powers is not correct.\\"  Give me a break!  I must admit, however, that the sound and picture quality are immaculate!  The colors are brighter, the darks are deeper, the surround sound is used to its full extent - fantastic!  If they had redone this movie with the original dialogue, I'd give it 6 out of 5 stars easy.  The original version was released in a two DVD special edition in the UK.  If you manage to get one (ebay - $25-30), you'll still need a region free DVD player.  What a pain just to watch a movie I used to love.  I've tried watching the redub a few times, but I usually turn it off after the end of the fight scene where Tetsuo wrecks.  Highly recommended to anyone who hasn't seen the original, otherwise, be warned.
B000E97X66|5.0|This album is a must have for any true Bruce fan. There's a raw, gritty, non-mainstream sound with this show. Kitty's back has some shredding guitar licks, you don't want to miss. This is the Bruce I fell in love with all those years ago.
6305014140|5.0|I can still remember the first time I saw this - I was on the endge of my seat from beginning til the end.  From great fight scenes to excellent animation quality, this movie's got it all.

B000M06K5C|2.0|I need to throw in a desenting opinion. I'm a huge BP fan and pretty well wore out Silent Alarm, which I thought was the runaway disc of the year. Maybe my expectations were too high then because this disc is totally uninspiring. I don't doubt that the lyrics are timely, thought provoking, and occasionally poetic, but the tunes are just boring. I'm not a musician or music critic, but I know what I loved about Silent Alarm - edgy lyrics, unique compositions, great hooks, and damn catchy beats. Hell, it gave rise to a remix version. This effort loses me entirely and is more apt to put me to sleep than out dancing. <br />I'll give it another try to see if I can drink the Kool-Aid like many other reviewers seem to have done. In the meantime, call me bored and very disappointed.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|She is the best live POP performer out there! That's a fact! <br />She's proven it yet again with the confessions tour. <br />I will say honestly I wasn't impressed overall with the Drowned world tour and the Reinvention tour but this one is her most solid tour since The Girlie Show. I'm just glad she released this completely and not cut into some documentary like she did with the Blond ambition and Reinvention tour!  <br />The dancers were AMAZING!!!!!!!! Like she said in the show \\"they defy gravity!\\"  <br />Madonna is also very smart in recreating her old songs with a new sound and approaching them differently on stage. Unlike some other pop artists like Ms. Jackson and her brother.  <br />It was also great to see the behind the scenes footage where you get a glimpse of what it takes to put together a show like this. <br />Overall this is a good buy even for the casual fan. <br /> <br />
B00011F5DK|5.0|We were hooked on Blokus after the first time playing it, so of course we had to buy our own!  We brought it to a dinner party, and the kids (ages 8-14) snagged the game for the rest of the evening.  Any time we've played with adults there has been rave reviews as well.  A little strategy, a little luck and a lot of fun for a wide range of ages makes Blokus a highly recommended game!
0345409671|3.0|Before reading this book, I was a little wary because of being a Christian. I'd heard mixed opinions from people (christian and non-christian alike) as to whether or not I should read it. <br /> <br />Deciding finally that I wanted to read *every* book in the Vampire Chronicles and reminding myself that, hello, this is fiction, I bought a copy and started reading. <br /> <br />Now, I found the first 4 books reallllly easy to get into. Seriously, within the first few pages I was hooked. With \\"Memnoch\\" it was definitely a chore to keep going as opposed to a pleasure.  It's not badly written by any means, far from it...it's just rather confusing in the beginning and takes a while to pick up pace. <br /> <br />When it does though....boy, does it do it well! I was at first stunned by myself feeling sympathetic towards Memnoch, but to be honest, that just shows how effective and emotive Rice's writing truly is.   <br /> <br />As regards Rice's re-telling of the creation story and the fall of Lucifer/Memnoch, again, it definitely helps to remind yourself that this book is fiction.  There is something so compelling about Rice's characters that throughout all her books, I know I often found myself beng lulled into the character of Lestat and all the other vampires and having to remind myself that this book is fiction.  Her writing is just *that* good!  <br /> <br />At the end of the day, I am glad I read the book. Though hard to get into, it was enjoyable in most parts, even if I much prefer her previous titles. I was also deeply saddened by something that happens to one of <br />the characters right at the end *zips mouth* But that's probably due to the fact that I adore said character anyway. <br /> <br />So, on the whole, a good read, if a bit painful to keep going at times.        <br /> <br />Right. On to the next one then! =D <br /> <br />
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|\\"We all have a weakness. Some of ours are easy to identify.\\" The opening words of `Dig' may apply to most, but certainly not Light Grenades.  It's no joke either; I've really tried to find a reason why Light Grenades should not receive my vote for album of the year in 2006, and every time I try I come up with nothing.  Is it plagued with filler like `99's Make Yourself?  Is it overproduced like `01's Morning View?  How bout inconsistent like `04's A Crow Left of the Murder?  No to all.  Like all other Incubus albums, Light Grenades contains a few absolute anthems in the Pop-tastic `Dig,' and the new fan favorite `Anna Molly,' possibly the best Incubus single since the almighty `Drive' itself.  Unlike all other Incubus albums, however, Light Grenades is an artistic statement that is both assessable to the new comer and satisfying for the die-hard fan.  What music fan wouldn't like `Love Hurts,' a staple ballad that will stand out as a radio-friendly gem (when compared to garbage that crowds modern radio frequencies)?  Yet, what Incubus lover doesn't appreciate the title track for the monster of a song that it is?  Incubus has not rocked this hard since Make Yourself; I'd even go so far as to call `Light Grenades' the finest 2:20 of Hard Rock in 2006.  Similar claims can be made about `Rouges', a twisting, harmonic, roller-coaster of a rock song that will stay stuck in your head for days.  Immediately following is the light mood `Paper Shoes' that's as good as both `Dig' and `Love Hurts' in the quality department.  The tremendous `Pendulous Threads' is a return to the old ways for the band, leaning towards the Red Hot Chili Peppers-style Incubus heard on `Morning View' and `Make Yourself' with its synthesizer/Rap-Rock nature.<br />The only draw backs are the double whammy of `Oil and Water' and `Diamonds and Coal.'  These are just OK, not as good as the rest of the album, but I still find them both to have descent courses and pretty catchy lyrics.  (Perhaps one of these songs should have been left out to maintain the flow).  Much of the same can be said about the `Earth to Bella' series.  Simply put, the first part was enough and the second part should have been left out.  But these very minor setbacks are easy to ignore and to forgive...in fact, even if the album had another question mark I'd still love it because there's just so much quality packed into this spectacular album that continues to rise on my list of \\"Best Albums of the 00's list.\\"  The songs fit together smoothly, the album flows with few setbacks, and there are some anthems with `Dig' and `Anna Molly'.  Taking all these facts into account, Light Grenades is more than just Incubus's best-ever album.  This is Incubus major statement, their own Nothing's Shocking / Blood Sugar Sex Magik / Angel Dust, thus cementing them as major players in the Alternative Rock genre.songs should have been left out to maintain the flow).

B00005A1PR|5.0|It's about time that more and more people discover the musical creations of India.Arie. Michael Mann incorporated one of her songs, 'Ready for Love', in his stylish '06 Miami Vice motion picture. <br />By listening to each song you can tell that a lot of work and art went into its creation. India Arie is not just another pretty voice, but instead there's much more to her as the whole CD has a lot of substance and she puts true soul into each song. <br />Her sultry voice soothes while she tells a story. Also the instrumentation is very well arranged with taste and applications in all the right places. This CD is a rare musical gem from an artist who comes across as believable and as someone who loves to do what they do.
B000M06K5C|4.0|A disclaimer, for those who are hardcore Bloc Party fans who do not wish to see the band's personal growth, and just want to appease their own selfish desires, don't buy this. Its not something you can totally relate to \\"Silent Alarm\\". But for those who can let that go and appreciate what a band toils over, get it.  <br /> <br />Always been a fan of Bloc Party fan ever since Silent Alarm. I still listen to that album regularly.  <br /> <br />Since I hear A Weekend in the City hit stores, well, I basically went fanboy idiot mode and counted down the days until it came out.  <br /> <br />Must say though, Kele really pushed his limits of using his voice up a big notch. I guess trying to show that unlike your other generic punk bands out there that he can actually sing, somewhat. Nothing like Josh Groban, but sure as hell of a lot better than the crap today.  <br /> <br />Also, the lyrics are good, if not better than the last album, \\"Silent Alarm\\". I find it how interesting Kele can sing political songs with such mellowness. A notable song  is \\"Hunting for witches\\" where you hear of terrorist events happening in London, and I'm sure the rest of the world, and the result of that is the police and the like unjustly rounding up people of Arab descent almost hysterically, just like Salem witch trials. Then there's \\"Uniform\\", where I believe Kele is questioning the integrity of individuality that we see today in our culture. The conformity, the mask that we wear, and the lack of originality. We're all cows. Count on Bloc Party for not imitating the stupidity of the west. Of course, you still have your lovey duby  songs like, \\"I still remember\\" that appeals to the hopeless romantics.  <br /> <br />You could say some songs are melodically enhanced too. I mean, they're not your typical hyped up songs like in \\"Silent Alarm\\" that you hear some similar synthed chords. But I'll be honest, that's the problem I have with them. Its not hyped up and energetic all the time! Sure, you can say that if the band does do what they did in 2005, they're not evolving, but personally that's where I think the Party in Bloc Party falls in. Don't get me wrong, even though some songs suck in that sense, it takes time to digest, and songs like \\"The Prayer\\", after a few listenings, will really hook you in.  <br /> <br />All in all, not the best of the best, as I still long for progressive and crazy beats of \\"Like eating grass\\", \\"Helicopter\\", and \\"Positive Tension\\" but not the worst either. Give it some time and you can convince yourself to enjoy it. Would I recommend it? Sure why not.

B000M4RG42|3.0|First off let me say that I'm a Clint Eastwood fan and I was actually entertained by this movie (it's flaws not withstanding). My title statement was in reference purly to the DVD. There are no special features on this disc at all. I mean none, not even scene selection. It's probably the cheapest lamest DVD I've ever bought.  <br /> <br />Now about the movie, this movie is not as bad as most people on here are suggesting, although it's not nearly the masterpiece that critics would have you believe. My biggest grip with the film is the pacing and editing of the story. It's told in flashback (which is really a flashback withing a flashback). It never really gives you time to get into a scene before it jumps into a different time/part of the story. Also, the character development was rather lacking. Other than that, it was pretty good  because the cinematography, dialoge, and acting were all A+. It would have been more entertaining and worthwile if the story was told from a more linear point of view. <br /> <br />If you really want to see it, either rent it or wait for the Extended/Ultra/5-Star/Directors Cut/Special Edition money raping DVD.
0688101364|4.0|I love cookie cookbooks and have my share of them.  Recently this one was given to me as a gift and I am so pleased with it so far.  Each recipe comes with a photo which I love, I wish all books would do that.  The recipes are ones that you are sure to actually make not just look at and probably make over and over again.  Another nice feature of the book is each page as two methods to making the cookies(food processor and electric mixer)and tips for storing and how long the cookies will keep.  Not too shabby!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is very romantic movie and is an interesting variant on the old theme of the talented and ambitious commoner and a beautiful princess falling in love, but she is promised to a prince she does not love.  The forces of the Universe keep them apart.  How can their love be fulfilled?  In this case, the ambitious commoner is an illusionist, a magician.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of Chief Inspector Uhl (played wonderfully by the always wonderful Paul Giamatti).  The narration comes as he provides a report to Prince Leopold (played with just the right sinister touch by Rufus Sewell) about what is known of the life of Eisenheim the Illusionist (mysteriously and romantically played by Edward Norton).  Although, the narration isn't quite comprehensive because we get to see things that the Inspector does not know.  However, we don't quite notice all this until after the film is over.  The movie keeps us in the moment quite effectively and we pretty much accept what we see as we go along.  This is just like the way we watch magic tricks.  We are looking for the way it is done, but the magician knows we are looking and uses that as part of his ability to divert our attention.<br /><br />It is important that I do not reveal any more about the story because learning the story as we watch it is the whole fun of a Romance such as this.  I will say that I loved the mood of the thing.  The actors are all fine. Jessica Biel as Sophie is the perfect love for Eisenheim.  She is able to be not only desirable, but has a common touch despite her regal carriage.  We can believe she is royal and that she would recognize and desire the noble love of a common cabinetmaker's son over the plans and political machinations a marriage to a prince would offer.<br /><br />Also, the quality of Aaron Johnson's portrayal of Eisenheim and Eleanor Tomlinson as the young Sophie need to be recognized. They have to convince us of the love and connect us to the adult characters.  They do so well that we know these are the same two people as adults without any faltering in belief.<br /><br />The music of Philip Glass is perfect for this film.  It adds just the right emotional connections and helps to tell a story that uses images as much as it uses words.<br /><br />A pretty darn good film.o so well that we know these are the same two people as adults without any faltering in belief.<br /><br />The music of Philip Glass is perfect for this film.

B00005ASOC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie a lot. There is not a lot of action, special effects or  mystery, but there is a good story here. Poor inner city boy with talent  gets to meet his hero and a friendship / mentorship developes. What really makes this movie tick is the fine acting and the great character developement. The whole film has a nice pace and a good atmosphere to it. I think the acting is superb and Sean Connery gives his best performance since The Name of the Rose. I had a hunch this would be good.

B000MG1YBG|5.0|Lebanese born and UK based Mika is the first great discovery of 2007. His brilliant debut CD is a throwback to the catchy fun filled pop of the eighties.<br /><br />Lead off single, and current UK #1 \\"Grace Kelly\\" is an upbeat, piano driven song with shades of Freddie Mercury in the acrobatic vocals (Freddie gets name checked in the song) and cocky lyrics like \\"Why don't you like me, why don't you like me, why don't you walk out the door\\". It is currently making it's way up the Billboard Hot 100.<br /><br />\\"Lollipop\\" is a bouncy, horn sprinkled, clap-along pop song, remniscent of Wham!. Catchy and fun.<br /><br />My favourite track has got to be \\"Relax, take it easy\\". The opening notes remind one of The Cutting Crew's eighties smash \\"I just died in your arms\\", but this is transformed by the chorus into a shimmery, synth driven Scissor Sisters-like dance number with lovely falsetto,<br /><br />The Beatles-esque \\"Billy Brown\\" is a tale of a married man who fell in love with another man.<br /><br />\\"Happy ending\\" is a lovely piano ballad with choir like backing vocals, and this segues into the melancholic, haunting and beautiful \\"Over my shoulder\\" with angelic falsetto.<br /><br />Upping the tempo again, and closing off the disc is the brilliant dance/rock of \\"Ring ring\\", which to me is the best song The Killers never recorded.<br /><br />If you like Queen, Wham!, Scissor Sisters, and catchy fun pop generally, get set for a thrill!!!
0393312836|5.0|`A Clockwork Orange' is one of those novels you don't expect to make the impact it does.  When I first purchased the novel it was simply because I wanted some shock-therapy so-to-speak.  I wanted to read something daring and edgy and a novel tagged with the `ultra-violence' moniker must be both.  Well it is both daring and edgy, to the extreme even, but as most every reviewer has stated, this book is so much more than just a mishmash of violence.  Inside this novel beats the heart of modern society and it asks questions we all do well to ponder.<br /><br />Anthony Burgess paints a haunting picture of a world torn about by violence.  Alex (Your humble narrator) is a fifteen year old punk, a bossy irresponsible rebel of the extreme kind.  He rules the streets with his droogs (fellow gang members), pillaging as it were.  The first few chapters give the reader a glimpse not only into these teens' actions but also their attitude towards them.  They have absolutely no sense of justice or consequence, and in a way they have no idea they're doing anything wrong.  The novel takes a turn when Alex pushes too many buttons and his friends turn on him, selling him out to the cops and he ends up a prisoner of the State.<br /><br />It's here that the novel becomes that `classic' or `masterpiece' everyone keeps talking about.  Once Alex is imprisoned he goes through many changes, but it's the cause of those changes that makes all the difference.  Forced to become a walking robot, stripped of his free will and programmed to be the perfect citizen, Alex becomes a model example of everything that is wrong with society.<br /><br />Anthony Burgess's fantastic vision asks so many questions and the reader can't help but try to answer them.  How should we feel about Alex?  Did he get what he deserved?  Did he get away with too much?  Was his rehabilitation extreme or justified?  The reader is forced to hate, even loathe this boy one minute, but only the heartless wouldn't feel pain for him towards the end.<br /><br />`A Clockwork Orange' changed the way I look at literature for it provides a balanced look at life and the decisions we make.  It makes a statement more so then just tells a story.  It exposes human emotions and inner workings, the darkest parts inside of us that we keep hidden from us all.  Upon finishing this novel I was forced to ask myself, \\"aren't we all the same?\\" and it's a question I feel this novel addresses well.  Everyone is appalled at the life Alex is living and the horrendous acts he commits, but isn't his punishment, his `treatment' as it were, just as masochistic?for him towards the end.   <br /> <br />`A Clockwork Orange' changed the way I look at literature for it provides a balanced look at life and the decisions we make.

B000LC55F2|5.0|I anticipated this movie for several months before the theatrical release and when I saw this movie on the opening night I was anything but disappointed. I loved the cinematography and the acting. The story was right on though not as in depth as the novel was, but film is of a different breed, so not to be compared with literature. However I may be quite disappointed if the special features listed are indeed all that are going to be included...this DVD defiantly merits a multi-disk set, so where is it I ask? Don't let the fans down by releasing this one of a kind film with little more than a trailer and a photo gallery included in the package, or is the trailer not even being included?
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is one production of Jane Eyre that I will order but as one poster already said - the British version has a 2 disc set with extras and the one that is being sold in the US has only 1 disc.  I will wait to see if I can order the 2 disc set - I want all the extras.   <br /> <br />As for Toby Stephens - I don't care if the original story said that Rochester was ugly or not.  Toby couldn't have been a better Rochester - he was totally yummy.  I am so glad the ended up casting him for the part.  And the actress that played Jane was wonderful too.  Loved the whole 4 hours - the only thing I wished is that it would have been longer.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I was really impressed by this film. I rented it and now am planning to buy it. I am a fan of old detective movies and found this movie to follow the serial perfectly. It is set in a High School, which is a refreshing change  from the other attempts to make modern film noirs, all of which take place in seedy places or at night. This film instead relies on dialogue to progress the story and create the mood. I think that if you like dark comedy you will appreciate the irony and suttle humour in the film. If you like mystery or just a clever movie you will like this film as well. Hope you buy it and happy viewing!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This movie has some minor faults and it is not Citizen Kane in any revolutionary way, but it was actually my 2nd favorite film of the year (Pan's Labyrinth being #1). There were some films that were more \\"Award Worthy\\" like Departed or even Babel, but I really enjoyed this movie.
B000J103PC|4.0|I remember reading the novel by Lauren Weisberger and not being very impressed with it.  However, I heard wonderful things about the movie, and so I decided to give it a whirl.  The Devil Wears Prada is one entertaining surprise!  Andrea Sachs(Anne Hathaway) is a young woman who aspires to become a New York journalist.  But before she could do that, she has to settle for an assistant job at Runway magazine.  This is the job that every girl would kill for because it opens doors to many career opportunities.  The women who work there have to be chic, wear clothes no bigger than a size four and devoted fashionistas.  Which is why everyone is surprised when she is hired to be the second assistant to the infamous Miranda Priestley (Meryl Streep), editor-in-chief of Runway and a force to be reckoned with in the fashion industry.  Soon Andrea discovers what working for Miranda entails and that there is no pleasing the woman.  Her life is turned upside down and she's on the verge of losing her boyfriend and friends because her life is one-hundred percent devoted to her boss.  On the upside, she gets to wear lots of Chanel and Prada.<br /><br />I love how fun and entertaining this movie is.  I enjoyed Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci, but the one I enjoyed the most was the film's biggest star: fashion.  You get a wonderful backdrop of the fashion industry, fashion designers and the fashion magazine industry that is simply irresistible.  If you're not that into fashion, you will very likely be converted after watching this film (or at least you will become more conscious about the clothes you wear).  The outfits, purses and shoes shown here are beautiful and I wish I could afford to buy more Prada and Marc Jacobs.  I also loved the beautiful scenery of New York City and Paris (where Miranda and Andrea travel for fashion week).  The acting is also wonderful.  I'd seen Hathaway in The Princess Diaries and it was nice to see her in a more grown-up role.  Emily Blunt as the snooty English first assistant and Tucci as the sarcastic fashionista are fun as well.  But the best one without a doubt is Meryl Streep.  She once again proves why she's considered to be one of the best actresses of all time.  Her portrayal of Miranda Priestley is controlled and subtle.  Other actresses would taken the easy route with this role and have Miranda behave like a complete diva who shouts and snaps her fingers at people.  Meryl, however, played Miranda with a quiet confidence and elegant prose that made the character all the more intimidating and hateful.  The character itself is one-dimensional, as she was in the book, but Streep played her beautifully.  I cannot recommend The Devil Wears Prada enough.  If you were a big fan of Sex and the City and subscribe to Vogue magazine, this film is for you!Emily Blunt as the snooty English first assistant and Tucci as the sarcastic fashionista are fun as well.

B000A6T1HC|2.0|I owned over a dozen of Bartoli solo albums, plus other operatic albums of hers. From the early days of 'Arias Antique' I got impressed by her beautiful singing and her outstanding technique.<br />Alas, starting from her Vivaldi Album, I do not find her singing that beautiful any more. True, the songs picked there are technically very challenging, used to be sung by male castrato singers. The songs picked here are even more difficult.<br />BUT - is singing just about technique?<br />There are some songs in the Vivaldi Album that have the vocal musical lines broken in places. Here in Opera Proibita, almost every song has this problem, even the slow ones of Caldara. Compare her singing in the earlier part of her career, her early Mozart operas, I could not help but wonder if Ms. Bartoli has taken the correct turn in her career: her forced high notes, though squarely hit, do not sound at all pleasing; her runs and trills, though taken accurately at great tempi, is no longer truly musical. Compare her singing with the other two great baroque mezzo-sopranos Bernarda Fink and the tragically short-lived late Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, you would understand what I mean.<br />With the latest turn in Ms. Bartoli's singing, I am being forced to admit that this is a singer of great technical brilliance and enormous fame, but not at all pleasing to the ear.
0312330529|1.0|The author \\"escaped from an Australian prison where he had begun serving a 19-year sentence\\".  19 years!?  He must have really been a bad dude. <br /> <br />He's made enough money now, with a movie script coming, and that's enough.  If you insist on buying this prolix tome, buy the book used so the author makes nothing off the royalty.  Otherwise you're promoting crime. <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|This was a great movie...I love Edward Norton.  He is just the sexiest I have ever seen him in this movie, the hair !, the character's tenderness towards Sophie...be still my heart! The story is great too...love the ending!  :-)
0618680004|4.0|You either agree with him or you don't.  The point is, if you're a person of any kind of religious conviction, do yourself the favor of reading this book.  If your faith cannot withstand Dawkins' arguments, then discard your faith.  It is unworthy.<br /><br />Dawkins is a persuasive writer, yet he clearly has an axe to grind here.  I'd say his strengths are his biological understanding of human behavior and his hypotheses about cultural memes.  His primary weakness is vituperative emotionalism, which makes him appear petty when faced with his alleged enemies.<br /><br />And yet he is valuable in this role he has created for himself, the warrior against faith.  He forces you to consider why you believe.  Isn't that great?  Allowing the prospect of God to be a scientific proposition frees the concept from childhood hangups and superstition.  The only point where I disagree with him is where he says that \\"if you think you've had a vision of god, you've experienced a psychological delusion.\\"  This too is a scientific hypothesis that he nowhere near begins to prove.  But read it.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Definitely a block buster CD.  You would love it.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Not for the closeminded.  To me this CD sounds quite different from her first, but as with the first, I was surprised to find myself loving it on first listen.  That doesn't happen for me with many CDs.  I really like the selections that sound like Brecht/Weill art songs.
B000BVD460|5.0|Ok, so I'm an English major, and my Psych Prof disses Eminem, but I dig it.  I thoroughly enjoy this CD, and it has not been removed from the car CD player for days.  Personally, I think there is a lot more going on in Eminem's head than he gets credit for.  As a student of Anthropology and Psychology, I also detect a lot of Social Commentary in his work.  He seems to be sort-of a musical equivalent of Stephen King (another guy who received little credit for his genius for a long time).<br /><br />Don't tell the Professors, but I recommend Eminem (aka \\"Slim Shady\\"); this CD is groovin' and addictive.  He has a unique flow and rhyme scheme.  I also recommend his other works and videos.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|\\"The Illusionist\\" is a stylish, turn of the century mystery that manages to be engrossing while not entirely believable. Edward Norton is the son of a cabinet maker, who seems to have acquired magical, perhaps real, supernatural powers. He appears in Vienna, amazes audiences, and is well on his way to becoming a rich man, but for reasons I can't say without becoming a spoiler, he antagonizes the Crown Prince Leopold, who tries to shut him down, unsuccessfully.  Paul Giamatti is the Police Chief, who has been corrupted by Leopold but whose conscience is troubling him as Leopold urges him towards more and more extreme action to get rid of the magician. Jessica Biel is a quite believable Duchess who is Leopold's fianc&eacute;e, but comes to learn that marriage to the Crown Prince may come at too high a cost. Norton and Biel are quite good--it may take a while for Giamatti to shed his \\"Sideways\\" image, but he's almost successful in making the transition to a costume drama. A lush, intense Philip Glass score is a nice touch. My husband liked this film too, and we had a lot of fun afterwards trying to figure out what really happened. Play close attention to the final 5 minutes of the movie!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I've just listened to this album for the very first time, and I felt strangely \\"small\\" and insignificant afterward. If God Himself ever produced a CD, I imagine it would sound very much like this.  I actually quivered with joy after it was over, and of course - played it again 8 more times that day.  It's just THAT good.  Breathtaking, stunning, incredible.
B000LC55F2|5.0|The \\"prestige\\" is the finale of a magic trick--the \\"AHA\\" moment when the escape artist extricates himself, the disappearing man appears in another location, the sawn-in-half woman is whole again. In this story a finale goes terribly wrong, and two partners embark on a deadly rivalry to be the first to perform the ultimate trick. The plot twists and turns in ways I certainly couldn't forsee, but I left the film not only puzzling over what had really happened, but more interestingly, wondering what was going on inside the heads of these two men as they lived the lives they had created for themselves. There's no real winner here; rather we see a tense pyschological battle that leads to more than one deadly end. Comparisons to \\"The Illusionist\\" are inevitable, but these are two entirely different movies. Enjoy them both!

031286504X|4.0|The classic vampire storyline has a tried and true formula: a single vampire is slaying person after person; carefully choosing his victims. This storyline then revolves around the hero's pursuit of capturing and defeating the vampire. Likewise, there's a classic formula for George Romero style zombies - zombies have overrun the world like a plague and survivors must fight to survive. \\"I Am Legend\\" (the novella contained within this book) combines the two plots.<br /><br />In the story, there is a lone survivor of a vampire plague. We follow his fight to survive and combat the vampires that everyone else he encounters has become. The story is not focused primarily on the protagonists physical fight with the vampires but instead looks at his emotional state - how he handles being the lone survivor, having lost everyone he cares about. I thought Matheson's writing and development of this was excellent. The hero is well-developed and comes off as a realistic portrait of the emotions that one would go through in such extreme conditions.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed \\"I Am Legend\\" - and the ending did not disappoint.<br /><br />In addition to the novella \\"I Am Legend\\", included in this printing are a number of short stories. Most of these pale in comparison to the title novella. The majority of them come off as plots where Matheson came up with an interesting ending or dilemma but never bothered to fill an entire plot out for the rest of the story. That is not to say that all of the other short stories are poor. I enjoyed \\"Person To Person\\" quite a bit. \\"Dance of the Dead\\" and \\"Witch War\\" were poor, in my opinion. Examples of Matheson coming up with a single idea but never writing a full story around it.<br /><br />All in all, \\"I Am Legend\\" is such an entertaining read that the mixed bag of other stories included is easy to ignore. I give this book 4 stars.
B000000WJK|5.0|This album is hard to describe but hell, I'm going to try. First off, if your looking to buy this album and the only thing you know about The Vere is \\"Bittersweet symphony\\" then this album may not be for you. This is unlike anything The Verve has ever done. With \\"A Storm in Heaven\\" the Verve take a very unothadox Jazzy,psychedelic Post rock aproach to their music that is simply awe inspiring. \\"A Storm in Heaven\\" has sonic sound scapes and sound walls that would make My Bloody Valentine and Sonic Youth blush. I don't know if it is or not but I like to think \\"A storm in Heaven\\" as the spearhead album that paved the way for Post Rock acts like Sigur Ros and Godspeed. It's the first album that I really heard the true essence for what post rock would later build apon. If you're a post rock fan or just like beautiful Psychedelic mood music then this album is a must have. Your music collection will thank you.
B00005JPKC|5.0|This American film presents the battle for Iwo Jima from the perspective of the outnumbered Japanese soldiers who were stationed there.  Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a baker with a wife and a daughter he has never met, is not seduced by the nationalistic fervor that prefers death to defeat.  He wants to go home to his family.  The new commander on the island, Gen. Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), who has lived in the United States and cherishes a pistol that was a going-away gift from his American friends, is resolved to fight for his homeland.  Watanabe projects the weary determination of a man fated to play his part in a conflict that he personally feels is a historical tragedy.  <br /> <br />Director Clint Eastwood has made a remarkable film that affirms common humanity across temporary divisions of national self-interest.  <br />
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I bought this DVD, not having seen it, but as a fan of stories about the Dark Ages and as an owner of the fantastic Beowulf translation by Seamus Heaney. (Ok, and as a Gerard Butler fan too -- I admit it.) So, I watched \\"Beowulf and Grendel\\" and -- it's not what I was expecting. Not to give too much away, but the script is not a \\"faithful\\" retelling of the Anglo-Saxon poem, so if that's what you're wanting and expecting then perhaps this isn't the version you'd want to buy. (Personally, my all-time favorite spin on the Beowulf story is \\"The 13th Warrior,\\" which I highly recommend for any fan of Viking-era sagas. Plus it stars Antonio Banderas.)    However, if you have an open mind and can stand watching a different perspective of the hero Beowulf (and the monster Grendel, too) then I'd suggest this DVD for you. The movie has a strong cast, and delves more into the characters' possible backstories and motivations. (It gives us some new characters as well.) It's definitely a thought-provoking movie, and I'd suggest listening to the director's and producers' commentary afterwards, to get a better idea of what they were aiming to depict onscreen.     I'd also recommend reading the Beowulf poem in tandem with seeing the movie ... and then discussing both, comparing and contrasting the differences. Yes, this is a movie that strays from the poem, but the attention to detail (costumes, as well as scenery), the acting, fight scenes, and the unusual take on the story make it a keeper, in my opinion. Definitely not just a monster movie, and there are little or no special effects in this production, since the director wanted to keep it as \\"real\\" as possible.       And for those Gerry Butler fans out there who can't wait to see him as King Leonidas in \\"300,\\" this film might tide you over until then ... he does make a very convincing Beowulf.     Recommended... as long as you're ok with this alternative version of the story.

Wow.  I pride myself on guessing the twists and figuring out the ending.  This ending threw me for a loop!  Never saw it coming...!  READ THIS BOOK.  Enough said.
B00006ADD5|5.0|Peter O'Toole is the enigmatic T.E. Lawrence. It is an indelible performance. The entire film is mesmerizing and captivating from the opening to final shot. This is David Lean's masterpiece.<br /><br />The performances of this film's cast are impressive. Omar Sharif gives probably the performance of his career as Sherif Ali. He is so natural and convincing in this role. Alec Guinness shows his talent for perfectly emulating the requirements of his role as Prince Feisal. Alec Guinness proves his worth as an actor's actor giving another conniving performance here. Claude Rains is excellent as the very wry Mr. Dryden. Arthur Kennedy as Jackson Bentley just shows us how good an actor he really was. He made it look so easy. Arthur Kennedy's legacy has been greatly overlooked.<br /><br />Maurice Jarre's score is a true classic evoking images that are eternally grained into our memories.
B000HIVO64|5.0|Great CD, I love every song. More upbeat CD than some of his more mellow ones. Love the fact that there are a whole 16 tracks, the cover includes Beck stickers, and you get a DVD of the videos for all the tracks. Terrific buy.
0895260131|5.0|Were the Muslims who perpetrated 9/11 really misguided fanatics from the fringes of Islam?  Is Islam a tolerant \\"religion of peace\\" and does it provide unprecedented freedom to women?  Were the Crusades an unprovoked attack by barbarous and greedy Christians against innocent, peaceful Muslims?  Read the newspapers, pick up a book by John Esposito or Karen Armstrong, turn on the TV and you are likely to be told 9/11 was an aberration--was even our fault somehow--that Islam means \\"peace,\\" that Christians and Jews experienced unprecedented peace and tolerance under Muslim rulers; rent a DVD of the recent movie \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\"  and see, in vivid color, the barbarous Christians killing, stealing and raping the \\"peaceful\\" Muslims under cover of \\"God's will.\\" <br /> <br />There is just one tiny problem with all these ideas and images--as Robert Spencer amply demonstrates in this well written, well-documented and extraordinarily informative book--  they are all wrong. The MSM, most of academia and popular writers like Armstrong, have, for various reasons--ideology, advantage, wishful thinking, denial-- decided to present Islam as peaceful when it isn't, women as liberated under Islam when they aren't, the Crusades as an unprovoked attack when it wasn't;  in short, an alternative and much less threatening history in a much less threatening world.  Their \\"narrative\\" is comforting--who doesn't want the good news that there is no conflict on the horizon?  But, if you plan on surviving in the future you need to read this book, check the references and see which version of history, which picture of Muhammad and Islam--its history, tactics and goals--is real. My money is on Spencer.  <br />
B000F5GNX8|4.0|In \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" you get everything you want to see on screen; murders, actions, wickedly funny dialogues, two cool guys and one beautiful lady, Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. are superb an incongruous pair who find themselves caught in the intrigues of the underworld in LA. Plus, the film is directed by a person who knows the industry of Hollywood, so what else do you need?  <br /> <br />Robert Downey Jr. is Harry, a thief who has managed to escape from the police by being mistaken for a method actor. After flying to LA, he meets a PI named Gay (Val Kilmer) and his (Harry's) childhood friend Harmony (Michelle Monaghan). The convoluted story unfolds in a film-noir fashion after Harry stumbles upon two dead bodies in three hours. Obviously he is in trouble, but how? <br /> <br />Writer/director Shane Black's screenplay is full of violence, but like \\"Pulp Fiction\\" the violence is of comic-book kind, nothing you should take seriously. The film is also successful in surprising us with unexpected twists and turns of the narrative and the tone of the story, which is sometimes very dark, and then suddenly becomes uproariously.  <br /> <br />There are references to Hollywood or noir genre, but Shane Black cleverly avoids the pitfalls of making it too self-referential (like so many cameos popping up). Instead he created an intriguing trio of characters integral to the story, which is the driving force of the film. The three leads are all fantastic, and I knew Robert Downey Jr.'s talent for credibly showing a variety of emotions of the character, but I never knew Val Kilmer could be so good with a nuanced performance, which is also a great asset of the film. And don't forget sexy and delightful Michelle Monaghan, who is much better than in `Mission Impossible III.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" is, as its title suggests, a modern version of noir film made with wit and humor, exactly what \\"Miami Vice\\" should have been.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Months after the hype and debate, Munich stands up well to re-examination. The London sequences still look like they were shot in Hungary and the film's avoidance of the Lillehammer incident, and indeed the fact that its protagonists never truly cross the line in any of their actions tends to make it far more partisan than its makers believe. But the strengths far outweigh the flaws. Easily the best of this year's Best Picture nominees, it goes to great lengths to humanize its targets, and does so without the kind of speechifying that constantly stopped Black Sunday in its tracks. Despite the effort, it still ends up less about the moral quagmire of the Arab-Israeli conflict and more a film about the dehumanising effect on the film's righteous killers as skirted issues of moral doubt give way to the very paranoia they earlier joked about. Not that the politics aren't raised - Black September retaliation for the killings leads one of the squad to comment \\"We're in dialogue\\" while the much-criticized staircase scene does at least remain true to the characters by having THEIR dialogue limited to their own equally narrow perceptions - but the film's real ambiguity is more psychological than political or even moral. Even when the hunters become the hunted and the possibility that they're informers are also informing on them, the film avoids black and white answers: while two Israelis are definitely killed by a team hunting the assassination squad, a third is much more doubtful.  <br /> <br />It's a fine piece of filmmaking, too, despite the odd mis-step, never feeling its 164-minute length and throwing in some excellent moments of tension as the inexperienced killers botch their way through their hit list. The period reconstruction is generally excellent (it has the look of Frankenheimer's French Connection II had it been shot in Scope, and makes equally good use of French actors), there's the Devil in the details (beds catching fire after being machine-gunned, the ever-changing kitchens in the showroom window that Avner looks longingly at as his home life becomes a faded memory, the glimpse of the twin towers in the final scene) and the characters genuinely look like they inhabit that era - indeed, Mathieu Almaric's murky underworld figure even looks like a younger Roman Polanski circa The Tenant.  <br /> <br />It also showcases the perfect choice for the new James Bond - though since Eric Bana wasn't interested, Daniel Craig turned out to be an excellent alternative, here giving delivering a convincingly blokeish 70s Afrikaaner. But despite mostly strong ensemble performances, it's really Bana's show, and he responds with an impressively intelligently physical performance - first seen clenching and unclenching his fist as he watches TV coverage of the massacre, desperate to do something, posture ramrod straight when he accepts the mission but ultimately shrinking within himself as it takes its psychological toll. Spielberg's best in years, and his first film with a decent ending in more than a decade, it deserved a better reception than it found. It also deserved a better DVDrelease than the current single-disc edition that replaced the extremely limited 2-disc pressing.
B0000041A9|5.0|Rostroprovich and Richter are poster children for the merits of recording the lesser-known works of past masters. It is astonishing to believe that the Beethoven of, say, Symphonies, 3, 7, and 9 also sat himself down to compose small music like these pieces for two amiable but sometimes socially incompatible instruments.<br /><br />That he did so is testimony to the range of his genius, a profound gift that we are prone to appreciate only for its depth.<br /><br />The phrasing and coordination that the two R's bring to this ensemble makes the two instruments play almost as one.<br /><br />Beethoven would have sat back in his chair, closed his eyes, and allowed himself the hint of an avuncular smile as though to say 'Now *this* is what I had in mind ... !'
0618680004|5.0|The author, an avowed athiest, has written other books, lectured, and debated with theologians about the existence (or not) of God.  In this volume he examines the many arguments pro and con.  Dawkins has given profound thought to the issue and is able to present very convincing arguments for his non-belief.  He also explores possible origins and motives for a human creation of god-centered beliefs.  His careful critical analyses of parts of the Old and New Testaments demonstrates just how careless biblical literalists are in their perusal of these writings.  Basically, this is a very important book with much food for thought.

1932907009|3.0|I don't know what to say I'm mixed in how I feel about this book.  Positives - it is an entertaining fast read,a nd I thought it was very helpful to me personally, it was good at getting my attention.  Negatives, his attitude which is condescending in general, combative, egotistical, arrogant, etc.  need I say more?  He certainly spends a lot of time plugging movies he's written, but I don't want to spend my money on too much advertising.  I also thought the book really skimped on the details.  Like when he described the Monster in the House genre - I was really interested in knowing more - and he wrote a paragraph or two and said he could write a whole book - well couldn't he have said a little more about it in this book?  He didn't offer much about it.  I guess what I didn't like was the RIGIDITY like the stuff that page 25 HAS to have this or page 75 HAS to have that or you need to have a do over, and that you HAVE to follow the silly structure that he outlines.  Well not all stories work out like that, and the structure he outlines seems too contrived to me to be realistic.  I don't know.  He did get my attention and a number of ideas went through my head.  I kept thinking the whole time I read this \\"He must really think I'm stupid\\"  Mr. Snyder I AM NOT STUPID!!!!   if I was stupid would I be reading your book?  Unbelievable.   Definitely not the last book you'll ever need, I can't believe he said that.  How many books did he read before he learned what he did?  Crazy.   But I really enjoyed reading the book, even despite his attitude which I didn't like at all. I learned things I didn't know before so that made it worth the money to me.

It seems like there was always a \\"making of\\" planned for the DVD but with the controversy surrounding the film, it seems like he put this on the shelf until time had passed by.  <br /> <br />There was little to no promotion regarding this special edition as I mentioned, so I don't think this was about reselling as it is giving the fans of this film what they want.  <br /> <br />Time has passed to be able to watch the film, listen to the commentary and now get a peek behind the curtain.  <br /> <br />Braveheart is still my favorite of his though.  <br /> <br />

B000DWMN2S|5.0|This exquisite film was truly an experience of discovery.  The beginning seemed perplexing but by the end one has come full circle, and the events revealed during the journey - and the way they were portrayed - made an impression so powerful that one carries it around long afterward.  Eugene Hutz is a fascinating character.  He and all the others in the movie all deserve high praise for this very unusual effort.

B000002LIX|4.0|Before the ulikely reunion with Dave Navarro etc this album was considered to be that last JA album we'd have bestowed upon us by this most famous of Perry Farrells vehicles. And like the previous two slabs from this most eclectic of heavy art rock acts it's a scattered journey.<br /><br />From the stop start attack of Stop! to the rants of later tracks onthis disc this is not the sort of stuff your going to hear on an easy listening station. Or even a mainstream metal radio station. In actual fact the majority of this album is hard to pin down which is perhaps why so many people loved this band. The listener has to really wrestle with much of this album, Been Caught Stealing and perhaps Stop! being the only two tracks that really strike me as being fairly linear or at leat easily digested.<br /><br />Never having swum as close to the current as Farrell and the lads I find it hard to really fathom what is going on here. Perhaps it's something only mind expanding drugs can unlock. Certainly my more chemically adventurous friends back in those long gone high school days seemed to get more out of this labrynthical musical offering. Ultimately to me this album just didn't penetrate my phsyche - coming across as an angrier Hawkwidn in terms of me not really knowing what's going on though where Hawkwinds' art rock was minimalist the JA lads strafe their listeners with mentally frayed lyrics and dive bomb t hem with musical moves that fit perfectly in a disjointed way, like you've woken up in an alternate musical universe.<br /><br />Art rock sequing into art metal, JA give the listener precious few handholds with which to climb the mountain, riffs are barely worthy of the name in some cases while in others they are totally accessable and then disappear.<br /><br />My best advice for the newcomer is to get the accepted masterpiece of Nothings Shocking, then this disc which will forever known as their second best and if your still on board then try their self titled debut. Of course I'm discounting their later 'reunion' albums as I've not heard them and don't want to comment on 'em and lead you astray. Though the tour for Strays was a fun gig....<br /><br />Perhaps the most helpful thing I can say is that the new fan should try to pick up the bands catalogue cheaply as listening to JA'a albums out of their temporal time and space will never give you an appreciation of just how influential their music and persona was. A band that, a touch like Nirvana, were more influential than they were actually good in and of themselves. A low four stars IMHO.debut.

1420927272|5.0|Although this was a very short book, it actually took me weeks to read, although admittedly I was trying to read it in my spare time at work and here and there at home. <br />Can't really say I'd call it a 'page turner', however it was chock full of valuable information and insight. I found myself reading each section at least twice to make sure I didn't miss anything. <br />Okay...maybe a bit dry... but I thought it was well worth the read.
B00005JPAM|4.0|I enjoyed this movie greatly. It was superbly done. Mirren makes you believe in her as the Queen. The Blair-a-like and the Charles-a-like are a bit less convincing. Prince Philip is one of the special treats, so absurdly lost in convention and cliche and so far from anything close to reality.<br /><br />I do not have much for or against the 'royals' but this revelation of their obtuseness is made credible by Mirren's restrained performance. The filmgoer is actually moved to a certain sympathy for the Queen. The most touching moment is when she comes at last to Buckingham and sees the tons of flowers outside which are expressions of love for the deceased Diana. She takes a bouquet from a little girl and asks her 'May I place it for you?' When the little girl says 'It's for you, Ma'am' one sees the Queen suddenly moved, vulnerable and human.<br /><br />There is however one part of the film which did really put me off. It has to do with the hunting business, and involves the killing of a huge elk and the Queen's incidentally being forced to see it hanging after its shot. Yicchh. Totally disgusting.<br /><br />In fact this also points to the objectionable almost inhumane ethic which at times seems to rule among the Royals and the English Aristocracy.<br /><br />In any case this movie is filled with small gems of ridiculousness and absurdity which bring forth pleasant laughter.<br /><br />Apparently we human beings of the lower orders take great enjoyment in laughing at our so- called 'betters'.
B00005ATQF|1.0|I should have known better, I do not like Kubrick's movies, I thought Space Odyssey 2001 was incomprehensible and have shied away from his stuff ever since. But being a war movie fan, I weakened and paid the price, a waste of time, looks like most of it was shot on the back lot in England. The name of the movie was good and the graphic on the DVD cover , that's the best I can say about it.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|This film is a must see. Sean Penn's performance is an A+. Dead Man Walking will hold you captive throughout the entire movie.
1400064287|5.0|As a former litigator, one of the most difficult things to do is to make your ideas STICK.  This book dissects sticky ideas, provides excellent 'sticking' guidance, and is clear and concise.  All the while, the Heath's make it an entertaining and enjoyable read.  This book will stick with me throughout the rest of my career! Highly recommended to everyone.
B000MGBSI0|5.0|I was in high school when this show was on the air and every monday night was melrose place night.  Remember the tagline \\"mondays are a bitch\\" with a big picture of Heather Locklear?  This show was so much fun, I was too young to really get into Dallas or Dynasty or even Knott's Landing, so Melrose Place and 90210 were my primetime soaps! Season Two was when it really started getting good, season one was so boring, in these days of come and go TV shows, Melrose and 90210 were both lucky they survived such slow and sometimes absurd first seasons to really mature into addictive drama the way they did in their second seasons.  I can't wait to buy this and I can't wait for season 3 which is the best season of the entire series, in which Kim blows up the building, we meet poor little rich girl Brooke and watch Alison become a raging alcoholic.  So much fun, so much drama!
0380002930|5.0|I always carry a copy of this book with me and if anyone asks about it I will hand it over to them.  It is one of THE BEST books of all time and deserves to be shared whenever possible.<br /><br />To those of you who say it's only a book about rabbits, you obviously haven't read it.  To quote my brother, who refused to read it for years and then finally did to get me to leave him alone, \\"You think it's a book about rabbits but it's really a book about humanity.\\"<br /><br />Hazel is an all-time great \\"everyman-anyman\\" hero.

0062515675|1.0|Lets not forget that this book is a fable.  It was a story constructed to support the claims made by Robin Sharma.  Theres some good advice in this book about staying positive and not buying into negative thoughts, and finding a hobby.  But its just more of the same old Self-help junk, Let me explain it here: <br /> <br />Lets say your stranded in some body of water, and you've been treading for what seems like forever, and finally when you give up treading water, you realize you are standing on a sand bar and you really weren't in danger after all.  Self-help is treading water when you don't have to be, give up the bogus self-improvement plan, the only thing thats wrong with you is that you think that you are broken, let go of your sob story, and stand up and live. <br /> <br />If your dreams don't come true, all Robin has to do is say that you weren't believing it enough and weren't working hard enough.  Theres no way for him to be proven wrong.  It's a win-win situation for him.  If you real get down to the bottom of things in his philosophy, everything is your fault, he gets off scot-free.  Also, read up on confirmation bias. <br /> <br />Consider this : when you live as though thoughts are as real as reality you live in prison.  Could be a good prison and might be a bad prison.  But prison is prison and your still in bondage to thought.  Don't buy into thought, and experience reality and be free. <br /> <br />Now your ego will use every trick in the book to convince you that you absolutley have to believe in your thoughts.  Just watch it go.
B00005JLZN|4.0|This was a film of two intentions - a thriller, and a message movie. It is a worthy intention to put the message into some context as a thriller to make it palatable; it makes the medicine easier to swallow. However the film is beset by a problem of balance .. Where the thriller slacks off, the message seems too in your face, and where the thriller takes off it seems too shallow for want of the message. <br />Alan Parker handled the balance so much better in Mississippi Burning, that if you came to this expecting the same standard you would be very disappointed. <br />However, the cast do adequately, and Spacey and Linney do brilliantly, adding the depth that makes the film engrossing enough to enjoy watching. <br />Those who are expecting the film to hold its own as a thriller will be disappointed however.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I purchased these DVDs after renting and enjoying the movie \\"Serenity.\\"  I was told that the movie was based on a TV series that no longer aired.  I decided to take a chance and buy this series and am definitely not disappointed.  This science fiction is different from most Sci-Fi that is produced today simply because there are no aliens.  The characters are always human, most interesting, sometimes frustrating, but always entertaining.  It is really too bad that the TV series didn't last longer.
B000FGGE7C|1.0|Good PQ and a solid transfer cannot save this movie. By far one of the worst movies on Blu ray, utter garbage. Terrible acting and some of the worst action I have ever seen in a action movie. Story is lacking and somewhat confusing. Blu ray can't save this films many flaws!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was looking forward to Firefly based on Joss Whedon's creations Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  I was not disapointed with his work.  Although Fox made a number of dubious decisions regarding the airing of Firefly, the show itself was phenomenal.  The actors clicked, the characters lived and breathed, the effects were excellent and the plots engaging.  And, as always for a Whedon show, the dialog and character interation were simply amazing.  A must see not for science fiction fans, but for anyone who enjoys character interaction and development.
B00009RDG9|4.0|It's not hard to see how this movie got made.. a director known for gritty streetwise thrillers (The French Connection), about a soldier who was trained to kill, but now can't turn it off due to battle scarring (First Blood, anyone?), starring Tommy lee Jones reprising his role in the Fugitive, but with a twist.. <br />Tommy Lee Jones is just the right casting for the role of the 'Tracker' - a man whose father was a soldier, but trained his son how to kill, and survive in the wilderness, be stealthy - in order that he would never have to kill. Now one of his proteges has gone rogue, and TLJ is brought out of retirement to track him down, meeting along the way the FBI agent played by Connie Nielsen. <br />The concept is a good one, if unoriginal. The idea of the tracker is fascinating, and as the extras on the DVD show, not without basis in fact - but the execution is a mixed bag. <br />On the plus side, the knife fighting scenes have a gritty fast moving realism to them that has rarely been seen. This is one of the movies big attractions. On the minus side, the movie feels like it has been chopped up, and pieces gone missing. Even the deleted scenes only give a hint to some of the directions the movie was going. There is a cynicism about Americas military here, similar to Friedkins last movie Rules of Engagement, but whatever message comes along with that has thinned out along the way. The roles the actors play do not leave the actors room to flesh out and inhabit their characters. Connie Nielsen does her best, which is pretty darn good, in a woefully underwritten role which seems in the end to serve little useful purpose. <br />On the whole though this is an edge of the seat chase movie, set in breathtaking, if chilly, scenery in Oregon and British Columbia, and should not disappoint. Just dont expect to remember much about it in a month or two. <br />3 and a half stars! I rounded up to 4 for the great fight choreagraphy..
B000MXPE7O|5.0|I have to agree with one reviewer who says that those who don't understand this movie or find it \\"boring\\" are probably part of the ADD set who have little perspective on the historical context.  Still, there is something to be said for the ponderous plot and drawn-out running time being a little heavy.  But heavy of the sort that unfolds over multiple viewings.  I've only seen the film once, and I KNOW that there is so much going on within the long silences and wide plot twists that I need to see this more than twice to really get everything that's really going on.  It requires the sort of patience and intellectual effort that isn't for everyone, and will probably appeal to older viewers who remember what was going on when WWII went down and the insidious, paranoid years after the Bomb.  As for the acting, these stars pull off a gravity that most actors can only aspire to, and flesh out performances that suggest more than they state outright.  Subtlety is De Niro's way here.  Not for everyone, but definitely a flawed masterpiece.
B00005JOLI|5.0|While so many people are complaining about the story moving too fast and leaving out too many parts, I found it an entertaining movie.  Be realistic--it's difficult to put 500 pages of a book into an hour and a half movie, but give it the credit it deserves.  It was a great story told in an entertaining way without overdoing the violence and surprisingly with no foul language or sex.  Hollywood take note-- stories can be told in an entertaining way without the garbage.  This is a great movie for your family (I wouldn't show it to very young children because of fantasy and violence.)  I will buy this on DVD.
0451169514|5.0|I just recently finished this book.  I liked it very much.   <br />The book starts off firhgtening in the extreme.  The creepiness and suspence really do something for me.  The book remains frightening for qutie some time.  The fright begins to taper off a bit twords the end, but it remains extremely interesting, wich is why I'm not taking off a star for this slight failing.   <br />The only other thing that dissappointed me was that the adult half of the book was not as good as the child half.  The adult half is good for some time, until you realize that the monster that is the main antagonist of the story is seemingly unable to hurt the adult characters.  You wonder why they were so scared of something like that.   <br />Basically, the suspence builds, getting the reader to expect a horrifying climax, but unfortunately the climax, while still good, proves inferior to the suspense building.  Still, I highly recommend this book, unless you are faint of heart.  There are certain scenes in the book that will you will find quite haunting (I had nightmares after reading about the clown on the ice, and the monsters first kill is one of the most shocking scenes I've ever come across in a book.
1582701709|1.0|The problem I have with this is that no matter how motivated we are, or how much will power we have, we all will eventually come to the end of our own strength. <br /> <br />Even Oprah, who said she had always lived by this principle and that it always worked for her, while she has certainly achieved much more than most of us can imagine, still had problems in her love life (despite the secret's claim that we just need to teach people how to treat us).  <br /> <br /> <br />I think, there is just enough truth in this to be attractive - certainly we all want to be in control. Certainly, our thoughts/feelings/actions influence results. But I don't think we can ever truly control other people's actions - which also have consequences for us - or for that matter even our own thoughts/feelings/actions at all times in all places. <br /> <br />The fact is that we will all die and most of us will probably die from some illness. So what do we do when we are suffering and at the end of our energy - do we think then that it is our own fault and that we have not thought/felt/acted correctly and then by some immense strength of will refocus ourselves so that we regain our previous health? <br /> <br />I think the true secret is Christ and the Holy Spirit who empowers us for good - who will never leave us or forsake us and who loves more than we can ever imagine. This is the true gift that we need only to accept. I think it is a lie from hell (originating in the garden) that we can do it ourselves. <br /> <br />

B0007Y08QA|5.0|Trevor Reznik's (Christian Bale) insomnia has crossed over into the danger zone. The man hasn't slept in a year, and his physical and mental health have eroded. His call-girl girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is the only bright spot in his quickly deteriorating world. But when cryptic notes turn up in his apartment and he has visions of a co-worker nobody else can see, is it reality or the next level of his sleeplessness that's to blame? good cinematic thriller with strong writing. The incredible directing drew the best of performances out of the actors. A+ work all around. Bale proved his dedication to his role and also did a stellar performance. Leigh was mesmerizing. Ironside did great work in a supporting role. The story kept me in suspense to the end. Seeing a normal person so wrenched emotionally and physiologically by circumstances made me wonder if Trevor could be in any city, with the name Bob, Joe, or George. Also check out bale's weight loss shocking!

B00005K3NY|4.0|I have not seen every movie Ironside did, but this is a perfect performance by him.  I bought this before I ever even saw it.  I must say, it wasn't EXACTLY what I expected.  It was still quite good though.  As great as Ironside did in being a villian, I think he could have easily played the hero in this as well.  His final scan with his brother in the movie was pretty intense.  Also, his first scan was pretty interesting.  His facial gestures were right on for what was going on as was the guy who, well, was supposed to be scanning Ironside.  Good suspense for a Sci-Fi flick.  The weak side of this movie was the hero, Stephen Lack.  His acting was a bit shaky.  I suggest this however.  I also bought Videodrome, which i haven't seen yet, but looking forward to it.  Crossing my fingers.....
B00005U122|5.0|WOW, fantastic sound, entertaining show, polished performers and those wonderful Pink Floyd songs.  Personally, I really enjoyed hearing Roger's solo work.  My favorite was 'Amused to Death' but 'The Bravery of Being Out of Range' has an upbeat energy and is done very well with a better sound than the released 'faux' concert version on the original album.  After seeing Roger's 2006 tour I now think the visuals were the only weakness in this DVD but the true fan will love it and look forward to his next release from The Dark Side of the Moon tour.  Here's to hoping!
1594200823|4.0|My daughter read this and lost her knee-jerk revulsion of hunting. Thus this book may lead to greater understanding between urban and country folk---all for the good.<br /><br />My one comment was that when Pollan knelt by his hog and laid his hand on the rib cage he felt the need to give thanks, he \\"knew not to what or whom.\\" Here is a modern man, striving to regain both humanity and maleness and he finds he has no creator to thank for his kill. We have lost much.<br /><br />The question is: can we regain what Pollan strives to regain without knowing whom to thank? without feeling within our own rib cage an unseverable connection to our creator, by whatever name? in whatever guise?<br /><br />I fear not.
B000058983|5.0|Not as famous as The Beatles, 'Sgt. Pepper,' Love's 'Forever Changes' is, nevertheless, a terrific hippie album.  Containing Latin rhythms and brass with some outstanding string accompaniment, the songs are simply marvelous.  The interplay of acoustic and electric guitar bring the listener to sheer transcendence.  Singer-songwriter, Arthur Lee, is a resourceful and succinct poet throughout.  With anthem-like lyrics and haunting love songs, Lee brings his audience to another level.  Certainly, it must be conceded that the venue is dated, like much of the music of their contemporaries, but this qualifier doesn't make the album any less worthwhile.  To start off, &#34;Alone Again Or&#34; is mesmerizing, alternating from a fast to a slow serenade.  Then, &#34;A House Is Not a Motel&#34; kicks in with surreal images that tell a broken story of heightened awareness.  Trippy, but partly nightmarish, &#34;A House,...&#34; reels in imagery, but refuses to totally commit to the confusion.  The anthems take aim at the conventional world, but do it ably and concisely.  &#34;The Daily Planet&#34; is nearly as brilliant as Dylan and as succinct as the Beatles.  Before 'The Graduate,' Arthur Lee could sing, &#34;There's plastic Nancy/With her children/Buys them toys/To keep in practice/Waiting on the war!&#34;  &#34;The Red Telephone&#34; also offers the contrast between the normal and new consciousness in a quieter, mournful way.  However, the trajectory of &#34;Live and Let Live&#34; is really one of the album's highlights.  Articulate and pulsating, Lee paints a landscape of Indians and bluebirds that are shot at simply because they're in the way.  Beautiful touch.  And, the lively &#34;Between Clark and Hilldale&#34; is about as footloose and fancy free as hippies got.  Musically, the love songs really shine.  &#34;Bummer in the Summer&#34; is shimmering folk, but &#34;Andmoreagain&#34; and &#34;Old Man&#34; are simply perfection!  While it may be conceded that Lee, like manyhippies of his era, could get corny, &#34;Old Man&#34; is an astonishing love song.  Surely, you can't call the exquisite orchestrations of &#34;Old Man&#34; and &#34;Andmoreagain&#34; muzak to your ears!  &#34;You Set the Scene&#34; is a finale that paints a rosy, optimistic send off with humor and encouragement laced throughout.  Some of the extras feel extraneous, but who can get enough?  &#34;Hummingbirds&#34; and &#34;Wonder People&#34; are treasures that help the CD linger on.  The rest of the alternate mixes and group interaction are interesting enough, but were never originally included for obvious reasons.  You can always skip them afterall.  (Not to insult anyone's intelligence, but while I love drug induced music, I never recommend the use of dangerous mind-bending drugs.  I'll take the vicarious listening experience at a safe [drug free] distance.)
B000KCHZK6|2.0|The new cd after one week is selling on Amazon for under 7 bocks !   <br />That could be a sign that a new cd is a flop !  <br /> <br />sorry Norah !
B00006JIA4|4.0|I was kind of skeptical buying this CD set, considering that I already own Classic Queen, but I figured I had nothing to lose but $26. I bought it, and here is my opinion:<br /><br />Disc 1 has most of the Queen hits that are known to almost every classic rock and Queen fan alike. The only disappointment (in my opinion) on this disc was that the full version of Fat Bottomed Girls was not used.<br /><br />Disc 2 has most of their other hits. Some notable ones include I Want to Break Free, Under Pressure, The Show Must Go On, Hammer to Fall, and Who Wants to Live Forever, which was edited but the full version can be found on Classic Queen.<br /><br />Disc 3 is not great, but it's good. It has some songs that shouldn't be there, but the only hits on there are Princes of the Universe, Heaven for Everyone, Thank God It's Christmas, and the Somebody to Love duet with George Michael.<br /><br />Overall, this was a good CD set. If you are a first-timer or a collector, this is good for you. But it's good for anyone, really.

B000FL7CAK|4.0|After the sensational first season of Veronica Mars, one would have high hopes for season 2. Comparing the seasons leads me to rate this one a little lower, but believe me when I say this is still one of the best shows on television. <br /> <br />Season 1 used a brilliant format. Mystery starts, plot twists along the way, cliffhangers galore, mystery solved, and another cliffhanger leaving us eagerly anticipating season 2. Possibly trying to shake things up a bit, you learn from the first few episodes of season 2 that its gonna be a busy season. The cliffhanger from last season gets wrapped a little too quickly for my liking, and opens up a whole box of new mysterys. It all leaves you slightly confused. <br /> <br />More storylines wouldn't be a bad thing, but I found myself through the whole season expecting one to continue to build as they worked on the others, but most of the time you get a several episode delay before the other story is worked off of again. It leaves you almost forgetting what the other major plot twist was. They all wrap up by seasons end, but I was very underwhelmed when compared to last years fantastic finale.  <br /> <br />Kristen Bell continues to shine as she adds layer and layer of substance to this great character. Even if the storylines disappoint (which they do not, just a little cluttered) she could carry this show to be good anyway. The rest of the cast does an excellent job but Bell is the star of this show, and would be even if she wasn't the main character.  <br /> <br />Was this a good season? Yes. Was it as good as season 1? No. That won't stop you from enjoying this show. Within the first minute of season 2 I was smiling just seeing Bell work her wit, and I think I kept in on until the last episode. As I said there's a lot going on with this one. The characters are going through transitions, and they leave you with yet another top notch cliffhanger. Can't wait for season 3.
B00005K3OT|5.0|A Dream ensemble that creates a magical texture that flows like a calm stream.  Picturesque visuals that take you away to that small town in France.  A wonderful date movie to snuggle and enjoy your partners company. Chocolat will heighten your spirits and take you away like a cool northern breeze. This is my fifth viewing and it never gets old with us.  It always teaches you something new.  With 5 academy award nominations its a must have in your dvd collection.
B000000OU0|5.0|After 14 years apart The Eagles got back together in 1994 to record 4 new tracks and perform in concert for a TV special.  \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" is the result of this project and in my opinion this is a must own for any fan of The Eagles.  3 of the 4 new songs are great ones.  Don Henley's \\"Get Over It\\" is a great rocker and pretty much sums up my philosophy on life.  Tim Schmit's \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" is a rather average song, but it is brought to a higher level by Schmit's unique vocal style.  No one cans sing songs like this quite like him.  Glenn Frey's \\"The Girl From Yesterday\\" harkens back to the bands early country rock roots, and is a good tune with great lyrics.  The other new track \\"Learn To Be Still\\" by Henley does not do a lot for me.  The live section of the album is solid from start to finish.  In fact I would say that this material blows the \\"Eagles Live\\" album from 1980 out of the water.  The recording is pristine and the performances just about perfect.  The band does an all acoustic version of Hotel California that incorporates a nice twist on the original song.  My all time favorite Eagles song \\"The Last Resort\\" is majestic and even better than the studio version, and serves as the crowning moment on the album.  \\"Tequila Sunrise\\", \\"Wasted Time\\", \\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\", \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\", \\"Take It Easy\\", \\"In The City\\", \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\", and \\"Desperado\\" all appear here and all sound great.  Don Henley's solo hit \\"New York Minute\\" is also included.  This album would serve as a fine introduction to anyone looking to explore The Eagles.  It also proved that the band was back in a big way.  They have continued to tour on a fairly regular basis ever since.
B00005RHGK|4.0|\\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is a fairly stupid name for a horror movie. It certainly didn't inspire confidence in me that this would be anything but another lame teenager based slasher flick. As it turns out, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is much better than it sounds, and while it falls a bit short of classic status, is certainly not to be underestimated. <br /> <br />Darry and Trish Jenner are traveling home for spring break when they are violently harassed by a seemingly psychotic truck driver. Soon after they witness the same driver dumping what appear to be bodies wrapped in sheets into a drainpipe. From this point on, the siblings are torn between helping the victims and escaping this malevolent madman intent on tracking them down. To make matters even worse, it soon becomes apparent that their attacker is far from human. <br /> <br />I'll start with the positives here. The first half an hour of this movie is sensational! If it had managed to keep the standard set in this early period for the entire running time, it would indeed be a fine horror movie. Darry and Trish have fabulous, believable brother and sister chemistry. Their acting may not be award quality, but it's far above typical horror genre fare. When the terror starts, and it starts within the first few minutes, the viewer already has a connection with these characters and that's a credit to the actors and the direction of Victor Salva. These first scenes are seriously intense and I love it. To continue with the positives, the creature itself (The Creeper) looks fantastic. They really created a horrific and fascinating being. Without giving too much away, the filmmakers slowly reveal more and more features of The Creeper as the movie goes on. By the end of the film, you can see him in all his glory and it's a quite a site to behold. <br /> <br />So why don't I consider this to be a classic? Basically, it goes downhill in the second half of the film. I've always been opposed to the use of psychics to tell a story and \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is a classic case. With no easy way to tell the audience of the monster's history, nor his reasons for killing, the writers created a psychic woman that for reasons completely unexplained, has a complete knowledge of not only The Creeper but can also see into the future. I admit, it's not done terribly, but it does annoy me. Secondly, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" can't quite decide whether it takes itself seriously or not. In my opinion, the first half worked so well due to its intensity and the seriousness of the scenario. Once it starts making self-referential gags and The Creeper starts whistling the Jeepers Creepers tune, I feel it loses that intensity. There seems to be quite a market at the moment for movies that mix comedy with horror. I just feel this wasn't the movie to do it. <br /> <br />Do the positives outweigh the negatives? Yeah, I think so. I really enjoy the movie as a whole and recommend it to any fan of creature features and horror in general. The sequel also has some merit and I hope we see more of The Creeper in years to come. <br />
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I have been a Beatle fan all my life.  I distinctly remember the first time I heard Love me do and thought it was the coolest song I had ever heard.  I have everything by them.  I thought I had a neat collection of Beatles sounds, but alas, Mr Martin and son made me rethink my status.  What they have achieved here is true genius! <br />The whole treatment given to all of the songs brings a whole new life to the songs. <br />I took a while buying the album because somehow I thought that it was just another compilation like the \\"ONE\\" album before. <br />How wrong I was!.  The second I heard the hypnotic harmonies of \\"Because\\", I knew that this was no ordinary Beatles album.  I was cooking while I listened and I truly had to stop because at moments I felt overwhelmed by emotion.  It happened to me with \\"Yesterday\\", with \\"Here comes the sun\\" and at the end, when \\"hey Jude\\" ends ups with that famous chorus.  I honestly had to stop in order to avoid cutting myself instead of an onion. <br />My hat is off to Mr Martin and son Giles, and of course to the masters of music: John,Paul, George and Ringo (May God rest John and George's soul)
B000JCETC4|5.0|This is NOT Pink Floyd. David Gilmour doesn't want it to be Pink Floyd. But it is a fantastic album by an amazing artist. It is best appreciated listening undisturbed start to finish with headphones on. David has gone all out in many ways... his web site gave tickets to see him perform on the Jay Leno show (which I was lucky enough to be a part of), he performed the first concert promoting his new album at the Mermaid Theater for lucky fans who won tickets from his web site. Later the Mermaid show appeared on the Big Screen. This cd has been re-released with a DVD of a performance for AOL, a song from his upcoming DVD Remember That Night, as well as a track from a performance he gave at Abbey Road studios for an upcoming tv event (I bought the DVD from his web site as a limited edition stand alone DVD and it is alone worth the price of the CD, but you get both!). His web site has gone all out  with a blog and constant updates. Oh yeah- this is a review of the album... the title track is excellent with classic Gilmour guitar solos. The Blue features a guitar solo  that gives a whole new meaning to the idea of \\"bending notes\\". Take a Breath has an incredible guitar solo at the end (and fares even better in the two(!) live versions on the DVD- and before you ask, yes both versions are worthy of being on the same DVD). I would say the only weak track is Smile, which I didn't care for much on his Meltdown DVD either. Aside from that, this is a really great album! And the more I listen to it the more it seems to just fit like a comfortable old shoe. Terrible imagery, but you know what I'm trying to say- right?
0618680004|1.0|Just a few words. <br />The concepts of God presented by Dawkins is a delusion. He is perfectly correct in challenging them. However, this does not mean that there is no such a reality.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I didn't think anything of this disk when it first came out. I read bad reviews and so passed it up. When David Gilmour launched his web site and prepared to release On An Island I saw a snippet from this DVD on his new site. I was intrigued by what I saw, so I bought the Meltdown concert. Initially I was less than enthusiastic. The presentation is very simple- no bright lights, lasers or Pink Floydy explosions here. Just a guy and his guitar and a back-up band. As it turns out, the lack of flash is what makes this such a special DVD. It is the MUSISCIANSHIP that makes this so great. And the \\"back-up band\\" is very good!!! This is one of my favourite concert DVD's. I watch it all the time and it doesn't get old! David re-invents some classic Floyd (Shine On You Crazy Diamond fairs particularly well- both sections!). Also, Richard Wrights' Breakthrough (which I had not been familiar with prior to seeing this DVD) was a very pleasant surprise. The Syd Barrett songs are treated very nicely here- as if they were David' own. And the DVD extras are interesting (the documentary) to fantastic (the Elvis tune with the female vocalist whom I for the life of me don't recall her name). If you like music- if you like Floyd- if you like Gilmour- GET THIS DVD! Watch it a few times- see if it doesn't blow you away!

B000M4RG42|1.0|I have been a lifelong Clint Eastwood fan, until I watched this mockery of a war film. First off, there is very little actual war in this war movie, the movie centers on the bond drives at home. The Bond drives are made to look as if the evil American government was extorting money to continue their pointless war overseas. This is no \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" it does not even come close. Eastwood has taken his feelings about the war in Iraq and imposed them on a heroic struggle that happened 60 years ago. I feel bad for the Americans who fought and died on Iwo Jima, this film cheapens and de-legitmizes their experience. Eastwood should apologize to the remaining veterans of Iwo Jima, just as long as he apologizes to the Americans and not the Japanese.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The 1st of 2 magician-oriented period pieces to come out in 2006 is \\"The Illusionist\\" starring Edward Norton, Jessica Biel, and Paul Giamatti. Compared to the other film \\"The Prestige\\" it's not quite as good, but nevertheless...I enjoyed it a lot. Sporting an English accent and a beard, Norton plays Eisenheim the Illusionist who frequently amazes the city of Vienna with his realistic trickery. The movie opens with Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) arresting Eisenheim at one of his performances and the movie flashes back to show us why. One night, during a performance Eisenheim is reunited with a childhood acquaintance in the form of Duchess Sophie (Biel), who is engaged to marry Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Despite this, Sophie and Eisenheim begin having an affair, which leads to Sophie being murdered by Leopold. Inspector Uhl, who is caught in the middle of all this, begins investigating the murder while Eisenheim appears to be resurrecting her at his shows. The movie's climax is a \\"twist\\" that bares some similarity to the ending of \\"The Prestige.\\" Both endings are good, but a bit contrived and don't make a whole lot of sense. They do, but it seems too unbelievable. The movie is beautiful and, at times, has the look of an old silent film. All the performances are good, especially Norton and Giamatti. Biel, who is frequently bashed by critics, is actually really good and really hot. Sewell always makes a top-notch villain (except in \\"The Legend of Zorro\\") and looks kind of Vincent Gallo-ish. The movie's very entertaining, even if you're not into period pieces where people wear makeup on their chest and write with feathers. The movie is not perfect (more worthy of 4 1/2 stars), but it's one of the best movies I've seen from 2006.<br /><br />GRADE: A-
0783233477|5.0|Very excellent movie to watch. The acting, music, photography and plot was just too good. Brad and Anthony Hopkins are both good actors and still are. Great flick
B000E1155E|3.0|I've heard the phase \\"Saviors of Rock and Roll\\" about these guys, so in turn I bought this cd with high hopes.    The few songs I had heard a few times on the radio were in fact great.  But on a whole that is exactly the number of songs on this cd that are great one or two.  The rest I think is pretty unlistenable.   So if you want a true review of this maybe listen to a copy of your friends first.  Like I said a few real good songs but to my taste a lot of filler as well. <br />  >>>---Zen--->

0385338694|5.0|I was hooked on the Shopaholic series, but even though this is a departure from that, I would highly recommend it.  Samantha finds herself being mistaken for a maid and ends up just going with it.  Seems a bit unbelievable at first, but the Kinsella-logic of the situation and the humor make this a great story.  I can't read enough of all the chick lit about love and work.  Speaking of that, I just read another really entertaining book by newcomer Tracie Clayton.  To Love and To Work follows Roberta Rubin from a consuming corporate job to a very unlikely new career and, of course, a new boyfriend.

0394721780|5.0|This was the first cookbook I bought for myself and my wife after we were married 34 years ago and had migrated to Perth, Australia from San Francisco.  I knew almost nothing about cooking and Julia, along with Simone and Louisette, taught me how to cook.<br /><br />The book is far, far more than a collection of recipes; it is a university course in French cooking but after plumbing the depths of souffle's and quenelles, terrines and crepes, you can attack any recipe from virtually any region of the world.  It might be like climbing Everst as your first mountain--after that everything is a piece of cake [pardon the expression].<br /><br />Even as a total neophyte, and this is not to pat myself on the back, the explicit and extremely clear directions will lead, after a careful reading, to a successfully completed, eminently enjoyable and some would say, very complicated dish suitable for any luncheon or dinner.  These three women have drained away from these recipes all the little blank spots that inevitably occur in most recipes; those little places where the recipe does not fully explain the next step.  The women that wrote this superb book, really a manual about how to cook, dissected the recipe steps precisely to the extent that there are no blanks anywhere in any of the recipes that I have tried and I have tried a great many in the 30 plus years I have been cooking from the book.<br /><br />At this point one may well ask, \\"Why am I writing these comments now, thirty-some years after buying and using the book\\"?  The answer is that last night I made a pork chop with a mustard-cream sauce that was superb, as usual, and believe me that says infinitely more about the clearity of the book than my cooking.  I love the number of sauces in the book so I looked specifically at the second chapter about sauces to find  some for vegetables.  It has been my primary cook book for all these years and I wanted to write something complementyary about this fabulous work.<br /><br />Treat the book like a university textbook--read it carefully, underline appropriate passages and then go back and take written notes on the material; you won't be disappointed and you will learn cooking, \\"... the way its 'spossed to be\\".sity textbook--read it carefully, underline appropriate passages and then go back and take written notes on the material; you won't be disappointed and you will learn cooking, \\"... the way its 'spossed to be\\".
0060723513|3.0|This book could be used at the High School level to provide teenagers with an introduction to the contrasts between Western cultures and aboriginal cultures. It is easy to read and probably has a Fogg Index around 8 or 9. Like one of the all-time favorites, Heinlein's \\"Glory Road\\", a typical, ordinary westerner is suddenly transported into a fantasy world of adventure. This is a relatively painless way of introducing the idea of comparitive anthropology and invites the young reader to question arbitrary Western assumptions.

0671891634|4.0|This book is a must-read for anyone interested investing. Peter Lynch ran one of the most successful mutual funds in history, the Fidelity Megellan Fund, which averaged an annual return of 29% during his 13 year tenure. He is also ranked by Wall Street as one of the most successful stock pickers on the planet. In Beating the Streets, Lynch outlines his common-sense approach to stock picking. The approach, labeled as \\"buy what you know\\" by Lynch, or investing in your \\"circle of competence\\" as referred to by Warren Buffet, is a simple strategy the yields results proven by many successful investors. In his book, Lynch goes through his entire process of stock picking from how he discovers a lead through what numbers he looks at to how he investigates the company behind the stock. I found the book to be an extremely accessible, comprehensive, and practical guide that is written in an entertaining and light-hearted manner. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wasn't born with a fortune in their bank account.
B000002KKX|5.0|I remember listening to sailing as a kid and was favorite song back then.  The only other CD that sounds similar to this that I've heard is \\"Reading Rainbow's greatist hits\\"... or at least some songs on there.  Sad that, that CD is not on amazon as well.  It's also a children's CD so the lyrics reflect it too.
B00005JLR2|3.0|I have searched through out the internet and I can't find a single form discussing about similarities between Treasure Planet and a Playstation 2 game called Rogue Galaxy.  They are extremely similar with 1700s ship design that can travel through space in search of a planet with loads of treasures.  For Rogue Galaxy, it's about searching the Planet of Eden where it has the most advance technology and eternal life.  The Disney's version is just a buch of jewlery and gold.
B000LRY9PY|3.0|I hate when record companies re-release albums with bonus songs or dvd. It is just a sneaky way to get more money. Quit trying to make us buy the album twice. Corinne Bailey Rae's music alone deserves 5 stars but to try to get her fans to re-buy the cd is just wrong. If I didn't already own the original, then this would be the way to go. What the record labels should do is save the bonus content for the next album or release it by itself at a lower cost.    Onto other business, She did a great cover of Björk's [[ASIN:B000002I0J Venus As A Boy]] and Led Zepplin's \\"Since I've been loving you\\".
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I am a big NJ fan.  Really.  I love all of her prior albums and rated them 5 starts.   <br /> <br />Obviously, NJ has a terrific voice and, in the past, she has chosen lyrics that were equal to her talents.   <br /> <br />This CD is a disappointing divergence from that trend.  Although there are one or two good songs on this album, the majority are . . . well . . . just plain bad.  Its like she needed to put an album together in short time and took music and lyrics from anywhere she could get it.  A few of the songs are just sing-song BS.  One song about the ship going down is what I would expect from a drunk Adam Sandler in a bad pirate movie.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong.  There are a couple of enjoyable songs on this disc.  But overall, it is pretty average.  And there are no true gems (whereas her prior albums were chock full o' gems). <br /> <br />Sorry to say it, but its true.
0743289412|2.0|How can it be that the person who wrote 'Salem's Lot and The Stand cranked out this boring, repetitive and annoying book.  There have always been clunkers in Mr. King's repertoire. Lisey's Story, however, is the bottom of the clunker barrel.  Even when Stephen King is off the mark, his writing can take lyrical turns that just enmesh and enchant the reader, and carry us along for page after page.  Not so in this book. I have read all of Mr. Kings books, fiction and non-fiction and have come to a conclusion.  The pod people have obviously made their own version of Stephen King, and this Pod-Stephen is the one who wrote Insomnia, Dream Catchers, Bag of Bones, From a Buick 8 and the rest of that ilk. Cell might have been a collaboration between the real thing and the clone.  Anyway, if you love Stephen King, reread the old books.  Lisey's Story is definitely the work of the Pod King.
1563894696|4.0|Jeph Loeb's, \\"Batman: The Long Halloween\\" is great story and graphic novel. The illustrations are breath taking and the characters are so unforgettable. A killer is on the loose in Gotham and every holiday there's a murder. Commisioner Gordon, Batman, and District Attorney Harvey Dent form an alliance and all \\"beleive in gotham city\\". Although this novel has appearances by the more famous Batman villains such as the Joker, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, Penguin, Calendar Man, and Two face, this book tends to focus more on gangsters and crime boss Carmine Falcone, his empire and Sal Maroni and his family. Its a very dark story where Batman must keep his promise to his parents of cleaning up Gotham and bringing criminals to justice.
0141439580|5.0|Almost universally, I find books to be far superior to their movie version, and I think most avid readers would be inclined to agree. However, in this case, without having seen the film first, I never would have considered reading this book because I often steer away from classics, finding them difficult to understand and hard to follow. I was quite enamoured with the highly romantic film Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam that I felt inspired to listen to this audiobook. The reader did an outstanding job of making me feel as though the story was happening around me and I was a part of this community, and actively participating in their festivities.<br /><br />Of course, my analytical mind couldn't help comparing and contrasting the book with the film. There are so many different characters, many of whom had very minor roles, or were spoken of but never appeared in any actual scene. Having seen the film first, it was far easier to \\"know\\" who everyone was, and how they related to each other. The book had many more scenes that filled in more details and had deeper character development, which drew me into the story more intensely than before. There were aspects of the film that seemed more romantic (the interactions between Emma and Mr Knightly, for example), and I preferred the way the film ended as compared to the book. But in both versions, Mr. Knightly was extremely swoon-worthy!!!<br /><br />I feel very inspired to read the book in print, now that I am sure to understand and appreciate it to its fullest. And I have just ordered the DVD film version starring Kate Beckensale, which is reputed to be the most romantic of all!! I have officially been \\"turned-on\\" to Jane Austen, and plan to read her other books, comparing and contrasting them to their respective film versions as I have so enjoyed doing with Emma.
B00018TI5E|5.0|This album is totally amazing.  I'm not one for electronic parts of music, so that's probably the downfall of the album, but all of the actual songs are really solid.  I'd love to use this album as part of a movie someday.  It's one of my top ten albums of all time.

B0007WYFHU|1.0|I think the novel lacks a purpose from sharing it's 'emotional' side from the begenning. The first couple of pages are perhaps a flawed copy of Gerald Durrel's great work. Next, the author goes against the 1st rule of writing: she has told everything and shown nothing. The book is too slow and does not engage the reader. It rings a hollow and a rather disgusting tone of the Indian culture and setting. The emotions are not well delivered and only the disgusting scenes have been woven into a sick patchwork of words. The characters are no more than caricatures. <br />By the way I am from Pakistan, so I know Indian setting better than most of those who I presume have read this book, and thus I believe that it could have been presented in a much much better manner.
B000H7J9QM|4.0|I have had the chance to watch several movies in BluRay and HD DVD.  This movie stays to it's wonderful action and great story.  Although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it.  Not having this movie on DVD helped make the purchase easier.  I have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting which don't always go together.  Overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch.<br /><br />Now on the Blu Ray scale.  In many Blu Ray movies you either get two things.  A picture that is almost crystal clear with no distortion or a movie with grainy hd picture.  I was disappointed when I made this my first blu ray movie.  I almost began to think that this was a blu ray standard.  Although after watching other movies I know better.  I don't believe they spent as much time as they should have transferring this movie over to hd.  That is generally the problem with some movies.  And for the price of Blu Ray players and the Blue Ray Discs you should only have the best picture.  So I only consider this a worthwhile investment for people who have either never seen the movie or have not bought the dvd version.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|As one of the first major releases of 2007, this album continues a trend I saw in 2006 of artists breaking no new ground, but instead seemingly stating \\"If you've liked our previous albums and our style, well, this is what the next few albums are also going to sound like.\\"  That most particularly pertains to the styles and sounds of those artists, and with Norah Jones's new one, it seems to be underscored.  Since all of these songs are written by Norah, mostly with her partner Lee Alexander, this third album may represent a more emphatic statement of her artistic purpose than its predecessors.  And that statement is something like \\"We're thinking people [Norah and band/friends], and we want to express our thoughts about issues like life in wartime, disappointment with politicians, violence in relationships, drug abuse, the downside of celebrity, etc.  But although we're passionate about these subjects, our expression doesn't come out like some Neil Young with Crazy Horse explosion, but like the warm, `quiet storm' type of music that we've been playing all along.\\"  The album seems to want to be simultaneously ambitious and modest, like someone who announces \\"Hey, I have something to say!\\", and then says it so softly that it barely holds your attention.  However, that quieter approach may still work, but these songs just do not seem to muster much emotion, nor, most particularly, do they have the memorable lyrics or melodies to resonate or even linger.  Some of the songs seem like throwaways or fillers for a live set, and quite a few others show the influence of some of the artists that Norah and friends seem to like - artists like Tom Waits or even JJ Cale.  Except that Norah and her collaborators are not nearly as good songwriters.  And that seems to be the biggest problem with this album.  I played it through a couple of times after I bought it, and then I clicked on random tracks, but in every case I found my attention wandering.  As an artistic statement, this isa laudable effort, but song for song, I think it's actually her weakest album.  Perhaps she needs some more seasoned collaborators for the songwriting, or she/they need to find stronger songs written by other people that mirror their own opinions.  The quiet, easy listening style that Norah has developed requires some strong songs; otherwise it can all too quickly fade into the background.
B0007PALZ2|4.0|This film takes place in a world where as knowledge knows it, the non-human animals have taken over the world, as you watch the film you will realize this, and many other great twists of the film.  It was a very great film with some great themes of time travel, such as changing the past will alter the future, and sometimes it is who you least expect it.  I don't wish to ruin the film for those who haven't seen it so I leave it off here
B000I2IT44|5.0|I'm surprised no one has mentioned the surround mix has no sound from the center channel, and maybe this is proof that all the speakers don't need to be used to get a stellar mix, as this is the best 4.1 mix I've ever heard. The following quote came from the official PT myspace page in response to my question about the absence of the center channel - \\"SW has said in interviews that he chose not to make much use of the centre channel for the live DVD, since it was a very unrealistic thing to do for a soundtrack to a live performance. I believe there are some solos and crowd noise in there, that's all.\\"     Some other minor issues with the DVD are - the layer freeze is distracting (couldn't this be inserted somewhere else, like in between songs?), and the video alternating from color to black and white is not my style. However, the performances, from one of the best current rock bands, make it easy to overlook these minor issues.
B000FC2FVA|5.0|These guys never get it wrong. The second I heard this I got the words \\"its never been like that, its never been like that\\" running through my head non-stop (especially since it IS in the refrain of track #4). Pheonix is a French band with weird words, a lovely voice, and some nifty tunes. Pheonix is easy listening, yet catchy as heck, pop, yet still rock. They hold a delicate balance between smooth and sexy. But I must admit, for most Phenox is a guilty pleasure, you enjoy it until you actually try to understand the lyrics then find out that you are not crazy and that the lyics dont actually make sense. But you still heavily enjoy the music anyway and sing along. You must buy this album, or any Pheonix album!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|In fact it feels pretty darn good! I've played this CD to death.  The vocals are amazing, the band is crazy good.  CANCER is one of the most haunting and sad songs I've ever heard.

B000002VTE|5.0|When I first listened to this CD I thought it was a little long and somewhat boring.  It was my first exposure to Spiritualized and from what everyone was telling me I was a little disappointed.  However, I did not let my first run around make up my mind.  I kept on listening and everytime I did something new came up in the music.  Eventually, listening to the CD became more than just music playing it became an experience of life.  The music eveloped me and I felt the connection.  There are a lot of CDs I have that I will listen to when I just want a sing along or to rock out.  However when I want to be part of the musical experience I feel there are really only two.  \\"Marquee Moon\\" by Television and this album.  There are others that come close to the experience but only those two really achieve the mark.  This is an amazing CD.
0393061434|5.0|This book should be read for its insight into the creative process in Steve Wozniak, aka the Woz.  The reader may find some slow spots because to the average person the Woz has unusual interests in playing games,jokes, and tricks on people, and particularly certainly an extraordinary interest in computer games. But all of that Tom foolery had an important role.  It was his fascination with computer games that motivated him to invent the personal computer as we know it today, rather than any early insight or interest in the corportate commercialization of personal computers.   The fascination of this book is that it explains how his mind works and and how it led to such extraordinarily creatively engineered computer products. The Woz was interested in fun and games, electronics, and computers, rather than a desire for great personal financial success. It is wonderful and intriguing story in the Woz's own words.  I would highly recommend reading the book for anybody interested in electronics, computers, engineering, and the creative process, for both adults and children.  In summary the book is a rare insight into the mind of a almost unique creative computer genius.  The Woz also provides somewhat candid hints of the strength and weaknesses of the history of Apple Computer as a business and an engineering company, and his early partner Steve Jobs.  Perhaps not entirely candid and direct in his evaluation of Apple Computer after the Woz effectively lost control of the company.  He does not romanticize and fantasize Apple computers, the way millions of Apple fans seem to do today.   I did feel the Woz is being somewhat diplomatic about Apple and Steve Jobs. That is the Woz's style and life philosophy.  According to Steve Wozniak the Apple II achieved great commercial as the world's most purchased computer under his engineering genius because it incorporated a large number of revolutionary Wozniak inventions,including the keyboard attached to a computer, a TV style display monitor, disk drive memory for a personal computer, the ability to translate the 0s and 1s of the digital computer into a full color spectrum display on the display monitor, the ability to self boot from ROM memory, extra slots to encourage 3rd party hardware/ software innovation, and very important for the Woz himself - the capacity of the computer to play  games with paddles.   All of this game playing capacity encouraged the development of serious bread and butter must have serious software for the Apple II, including word processing and spreadsheets for business and personal finance. The mainstay of the personal computer today, the internet and e mail, was not anticipated by anyone at Apple Computer in their brainstorming long term planning sessions in the early days, according to the Woz.  The Apple II was the height of Apple Computer's competitive commercial and innovative engineering success. The original Macintosh was also quite innovative in an engineering sense, but according to the Woz the Apple III never worked properly despite an enormous amount of corporate hype and huge advertising budgets. Apple III was as unsuccessful as Apple II was successful, both in a commercial and engineering sense. All of this is history.  Today Apple Computer sells beautifully designed iPods and a number of highly styled good looking eye candy personal computers. Their current iPods are another great commercial success story for Apple and Steve Jobs. All of their computer models today have in total about a 6% market penetration of the much more competitive personal computer market.This statistic can be misleading.Apple's offerings of different computer models are of course very much more limited than what is available then from all the models offered by manufacturers who license Microsoft's Windows operating system, and this limits total Apple computer sales compared to all the rest of the field.  Sales per model available from Apple are fairly respectable. At least onerelatively low cost Apple laptop is among the most popular in the market today  The book does not make clear how much the Woz, the founding computer genius, is still involved with Apple Computer engineering and design, or how much of a financial stake the Woz still may have in Apple Computer. Apparently, not much on either count.  After reading this book, I couldn't help but feel how neat it would be if somehow the Steve Wozniak could somehow turn to another serious technological problem like global warming, and use his wonderfully creative mind to help solve this major crisis of the future.
B000MR1V22|1.0|THIS IS ONE OF TWO RENTALS I HAVE NOT SEEN BECAUSE UNBOX FAILED TO DOWNLOAD TO MY PLAYER.  THE THIRD, WHICH I PURCHASE, DOWNLOADED WITH NO PROBLEMS.  AFTER 3 EMAILS TO AMAZON, IN WHICH THE PROBLEM WAS NOT SOLVED NOR THE COST REFUNDED, I GIVE UP.  THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This movie is very thought provoking and leads you down the path of whose in control, what might control us (media/government), and what is our willingness to break free.  There are some moments of \\"what lead to this or how did that happen?\\", but remember this movie is based on a comic book...nevertheless, it's worth seeing again, thus good for my DVD collection.  Note: movie does contain blood/violence thus the \\"R\\" rating.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Another positive review for this album.  Some wonderful tracks here that just get more enjoyable with repeated playing.  Young's voice keeps getting mellower and sweeter.  Plus, his songs have great message. Great work, Neil.
B000001G1E|5.0|James Brown has always been my favorite, but I was never able to find much of his music in the CD era before the internet exploded.  Unfortunately, it took his death to remind me of how much I liked his sound.  I've been on a buying spree since.  Usually, after you get through the best 5-10 hits an artist has on one greatest hit collection, the rest is hum drum filler.  I have to say that in the case of James Brown, the more I find the more I love the man!!!  He is truly the progenitor of Funk and hip hop.

0679745203|3.0|I liked this book much better than the boring movie. It was beautifully written but some parts flashed back and the ending was weird but the story was lovely about 4 lives during the war and you got into some of the characters lives. His style of writing in this book and the story was much better than Anil's Ghost which I found to be boring and redundant. A good book. I've read better but I've also read much worse.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|An intelligent spy story, somewhere along the tradition of John le Carre and Graham Greene, but set in the US intelligence environment, i.e. of course CIA and predecessors. Time is between early 40s and early 60s, so we get the world war, the cold war, some Central American adventures, and the Bay of Pigs disaster as main historical material. Throw in some African scenery.<br />Unfortunately the build-up of the plot is very very slow. It takes very long until one can put the jig saw pieces in a framework that seems to make some sense. Also unfortunately, the considerable acting skills of Matt Damon are somewhat wasted on a character that is so low key that he hardly ever develops real contours, despite overlength. Maybe the only remarkable aspect of his character seems to be a fetish for women with hearing problems. His main love Laura is deaf, and his only other affair needs a hearing aid (his German secretary, played by Martina Gedeck). Also unfortunately, Angelina is largely underutilized as un-loved wife of the ever absent spy. (I do not think she handles her predicament badly though.) Possibly she hears too well for Mr.Wilson's taste.<br />De Niro directs, and adds himself as a physically handicapped intelligence general who looks remarkably like Kissinger (but calls himself a Catholic). There is also Joe Pesci as a strange Italian character whose only function seems to be to provide Damon with his best line in the movie. I can not quote what Pesci said to Damon, since it is racist and Amazon's censors don't let me quote that. Damon answers: we (i.e. the WASPs) own America, you other guys are just visiting.<br />All in all: no waste of time, but also not completely pleasing.
1883010039|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a weaving friend. I taught myself using the book. I highly recommend it. I knew little or nothing about weaving before I started, and I have \\"warped a loom\\" twice using it. There were almost no questions I had that weren't answered in the book, and the authors style is reassuring and comfortable.
B0000046JP|5.0|I've heard a number of versions of this Rodrigo piece. Paco plays it with the most fire, and it's apparent that Joaquin Rodrigo also enjoyed it. It's also important to know that most classical players take sometimes up to a year to prepare this piece for performance. Paco, who doesn't read music, prepared it in two weeks. Amazing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't really write reviews about much of anything but felt compelled after watching this show, for the first time, years after it'd been canceled.  Thought it was the typical fan-boy hype you hear about when something gets raves and then when the rubber hits the road it turns out to be garbage...  Not so for Firefly!      Being in my forties I've seen my fair share of TV sci-fi and have fond memories of many good and not so good programs.  Far too many corpses litter the landscape of failed shows that deservingly died,  while strangely enough others went on for years, still this show was something of a surprise.  Here are good stories, memorable characters, and a freedom loving libertarian philosophy that hooks you early and takes you along for the ride.      In our present day world just where can someone break loose and truly be free without the chains of government?  Would that be the reaches of space?  And would the same controling nimrods that surround us now pursue anyone who simply wanted to be left alone to live life as they saw fit?  These are good questions that I can see strike a chord with its loyal fans.      If the Sci-Fi channel were wise they'd have picked this up long ago and made it a regular series.   I for one am going to enjoy it now, as it is, from opening credits to the last plaintive note.  You should do the same.    \\"...I don't care, I'm still free   You can't take the sky from me ...\\"
0452287588|5.0|Eckhart Tolle shows himself to be the quiet, focused master that he is in \\"A New Earth\\".<br /><br />I wore a pencil down underlining 'important' sections throughout the book. Then I ordered seven copies to give to friends and associates. It will remain a reference book for me whenever I need to choose between \\"peace and drama\\".
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|this is a good movie other then the fact that there all in high school <br />this is way too much drama for high school, but thats what makes this movie funny. because when your watching it you can say things like \\"we have to meet at 6 becaues my mom needs the van back at 8\\"
B000F1IQNM|3.0|THe movie was entertaining, and good gosh, dealt with brats that were actually handeled without a book on child psychology. Some of the scenes were silly, but it was entertaining, and fun to watch, Emma thompson, of course ,made the movie, followed by Collin Firth. The movie was predictable, but a nice slice of escapism. On the order of Mary Poppins, kind of an offbeat, but subtle version, that leaves you not feeling bad. That, in itself, is monumental.
0743298020|4.0|If you like novels that grab hold of you; that are a bit strange; that are aloof; that have intriguing characters; that have great descriptive settings; and that have a beginning, a middle, and an end, then this is a novel for you.  With a book as well plotted as this one, its sort of a 'sin' to discuss it, but the focus is on what the 'truth' is, pertaining to a life, to lives.   <br /> <br />However, I find the lavish praise comparing Ms. Setterfield to the Bronte sisters and Dickens to be more than a bit misguided - and anyone who's read them recently will surely have to concur.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I watched this movie with my 9 year old daughter and we had a grand time.  I am 51 years old and remember the original with Halley Mills.  I thought Disney could not top the original \\"Parent Trap\\", but I was WRONG! Double Wrong!<br /><br />Linday Lohan is absolutely amazing!  She charmed me with her uncanny ability to play both parts (twins) with such distinction.  Lohan is cute, charming, can act, and steals the show with her performance. She has a very strong supporting cast in Dennis Quaid (father), Natasha Richardson (mother), and Elaine Hendrix (as the conniving gold-digger Meredith Blake).<br /><br />It is a movie that every member of the family can watch and find entertaining. You will laugh out loud, giggle, and maybe even cry.  At the very least, the movie is sure to charm you.<br /><br />Thank you Disney for making a movie that parents don't have to censor or edit or explain to their children!  This is 5-star family entertainment!<br /><br />Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig (Father of 6 Children)
B000000WA4|3.0|Siamese Dream was a masterpiece from start to finish, an original sound, well-crafted songs, and lots of raw emotion and power. <br /> <br />This album is a big dropoff from there. This is when Billy Corgan began to scowl more than sing, and the quality of the songwriting is noticably worse. The lyrics are more obvious and less powerful. The rich, textured sounds of Siamese Dream are replaced with a more conventional poppy sound that gets boring fast.  <br /> <br />There are some good songs here, but overall this album is simply not that great, especially when compared to Siamese Dream
B000002UAX|5.0|Beatles fans should really enjoy this album. I have been collecting the albums that I don't have.
B000003Z12|5.0|Neal Schon's CV is pretty impressive, and this is surely one of his best works to date. Favourite tracks are 'Espanique' and 'Deep Forest'. Schon's range is incredible and this album truly shows his maturity as a guitarist that we had not seen with Journey's later albums, up to the point that this was released. This album is as powerful now (2007), as it was in 1995, and surely cements Neal Schon as one of the great guitar virtuosos of our time.
B000002UAO|5.0|I love all the beatles albums that I have bought. Their music is fantastic. I am a MAJOR beatles fan.
0743564413|5.0|All other published readings pale in comparison to this one. After careful listening, I believe that what Charlton Heston did as Santiago in \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", William Hurt has done as Jake Barnes. Bravo!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I bought this album and I love it.
B000KC86F4|4.0|I think what Brian Singer did with the first two movies was amazing and when he wasn't on this one I was prepared for disappointment. I went into the movie expecting the worst so was happy when the movie turned out better than I had feared.<br /><br />Jackman is great as Wolverine (again) but most of the other characters are very under-used which is sad since this is probably the last time we will see them for a long time. I also feel that the bastardization of one of the greatest ever comic storylines was a terrible disservice to the X-Man franchise. But, with that said, the story does keep the movie going and kept me interested throughout.<br /><br />As for the Blu-Ray transfer, it is great; a crisp brilliant picture and great soundtrack and extra features make this a disc well worth owning.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|To me and numerous Fleming (book Bond)fans the best Bond was Timothy Dalton. His reign was tragically cut short due to legal wrangles in the early 90's. <br /> <br />Although some people enjoyed his successor Pearce Brosnan as 007, i found him a lightweight, wooden pastiche of all the previous Bonds. In addition his films got progressively worse culminating in the truly dire Die Another Day.  <br /> <br />Needless to say i was overjoyed when Brosnan got the boot and Daniel Craig was signed on. Bond was going back to Fleming and back to basics for the first time since Timothy Dalton.  <br /> <br />Casino Royale was simply stunning, better than anything i could have ever hoped for in a Bond film. Easily the best Bond perfomance and film since \\"Living Daylights\\" or \\"Licence to Kill\\".  <br /> <br />Although Dalton has remained my favourite Bond, Casino Royale has become my fave film surpassing \\"Daylights\\".  <br /> <br />Mr Craig deserves all the praise he can get but i do encourage people to check out Timothy Dalton as Bond in order to reappraise his efforts. You may be surprised as to how good Dalton really was as Fleming's Bond.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|A simply fantastic transfer and amazing PCM soundtrack for a very good, action filled movie; this looks as good as anything shot on film can.<br /><br />The performances of all the main actors are strong and after about the first 10 minutes it is almost non-stop action.<br /><br />Great all-around; A+!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|As a child of the 80's and a fan of Heavy Metal, good solid hard rock and a bit of 80's punk and true alternative music, this is the album I have been waiting for for a decade.  I can't think of a more complete, fun to listen album in the last decade.  The lyrics are very well written, fun and serious at the same time.  The music is incredible.  The only way I can describe it is Queen crossed with Greenday crossed with Queen crossed with Pink Floyd crossed with some of the early 80s punk.<br /><br />All in all, absolutely excellent.  They have a new fan (even if he is in his mid-30s).
B00000IQC8|5.0|If somebody will tell you, that you can not make a good movie without a budget for sets, extras and special effects, show him this movie and proof him wrong.<br /><br />90%+ of the whole movie happens within or in front of a small service store (just like the gas station stores, without the gas station). The rest happens on the roof of the store, the neighbouring video rental store and If I counted correctly one off site location for a single less than a minute scene.<br /><br />The humor is hilarious and down to earth. The real aspect of the conversations makes the movie so great. The long awaited sequel Clerks 2 did fall a bit short regarding that.<br /><br />The Jokes (verbal and practical) are for adults and not kids. Foul language is being used, but last time I checked on the street, it's being used there too :).
B00004W221|5.0|\\"Rudy\\" is one of those rare films that no matter how many times you have seen it, you just can't change the channel if you come across it on the television.   <br /> <br />I'm sure most are aware of the story of Rudy Ruettiger, a Notre Dame student, whose sole dream was to play football for the Fighting Irish, but who had always been told he was too small to play and too dumb to attend Notre Dame.  He wouldn't be denied and through hard work and vicious effort, his dreams come true.   <br /> <br />This movie has great acting(Sean Austin, Warren Beatty and Jon Favreau.)  The soundtrack is excellent and the flow of the story keeps the movie moving at a great viewer-friendly pace.  I'm hoping that it's understood that any movie based on actual events is just that....It BASED on those facts.  It is not dictating them word for word and often parts are either left out or fabricated, as is the case here.  It's annoying to find reviewers knock a movie for not telling every detail of every story exactly as is.  Truth is, it just wouldn't keep our attention if that were to be done. <br /> <br />Watch the movie, appreciate it for the great film it is and lighten up! <br /> <br />ENJOY!!!!
1582701709|5.0|As a long time 'Secret\\" fan, the words in this book hold the key to creating the life you truly want.<br /><br />Our thoughts and feelings are like a reflection in the pond of life - what we see in our lives is the sum total of those thoughts.<br /><br />If you want things to change now (and who doesn't?), apply the \\"ask, receive and allow\\" methods in both the book and the DVD called \\"The Secret\\".<br /><br />Pay close attention to those in the DVD, and how they made remarkable changes in their lives using \\"The Secret's\\" principles.  Most rebounded from near bankruptcy, poor relationships and even drugs to serve and empower others.<br /><br />I've used the law of attraction to create a best selling book helping children succeed in school, take the trip of a lifetime, and calm my innermost fears.  You are closer than you know to turning things around in your own life, once you read or watch \\"The Secret\\" and as we've all heard - just do it!
B000M06K5C|2.0|I had very high expectations as well. I got an advanced copy of this album months ago... gave it MANY spins hoping to feel the same spark as with their debut.  The song production is overzealous, and has none of the the grit, hooks, and thrive as their previous effort. Too ambitious in my opinion and nothing really sticks.
B00065MDSG|5.0|I am listening to it right now. KC doesn't compromise. They are the Wagner of rock. <br /> <br />Buy this and the complete King Crimson catalogue. If you don't like it, one of your grandkids will. Like lots of great music, King Crimson isn't appropriately revered in its time. One day, you'll be able to walk into any bar and there will always be least one Crimhead in the room. <br /> <br />Music is my life. The music I am most passionate about is King Crimson. <br /> <br />KC forever!
1582701709|5.0|The subject of changing the way you think was all \\"hogwash\\" to me. Then, when I got older, it became too dry to keep my attention. Now, at 50 odd, this \\"Secret\\" comes along. It really got my attention this time! I take the book with me everywhere; it's become my friend. I feel so good about how this little book has turned my brain around, that I'm considering having the book blessed by a priest!
B00000JFV9|5.0|A must have album to an unforgettable film. Curtis Mayfield's Superfly soundtrack embodies to me what was going on in the 1970s. I was born in 1982, so when I listen to this album, I am amazed at how much it also seemed to intertwine with what was happening in the 1980s. The songs that make that point would be \\"Little Child, Running Wild, Pusherman, Freddie's Dead, Eddie,(You should've known better), and Superfly\\". The soundtrack is timeless.
0618680004|1.0|How can it be that this man, Richard Dawkins, can be so well informed, so smart, so eloquent, so knowledgable, etc, etc, etc, and at the same time be so wrong, so stupid, so blinded, so ignorant, so biased, and so lost? How can it be? <br />Perhaps the answer is found in Romans 1:18-25. <br />\\"..... For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God, or give thanks; but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. ....\\" <br />Carl Sagan knows; Stephen J. Gould knows; ask them, Richard. <br />This book, along with the other books he penned will end up in the trash heap of wrong ideas. This is not ad hominem attack; it is a comment on all his published works. <br />What a shame to waste such a magnificant, gifted, intellect on foolish speculations. <br />Perhaps the very best description of all his work is: <br />Bad theology; bad science.
B00005JPAM|4.0|RATE: 3.75 stars<br /><br />This is the shorters review (book or DVD) that I've written.  I took my mom out to see this movie cause I knew she would like it (and I haven't been to a cinema in eons).  The overdriving theme in this close-to-real-life drama, is that the anachronistic lifestyle of the monarchy, and the fight between modernist parlamentarian mindset vs. monarchial autocracy.  The purely proper British language, manners, and formalism were amusing rather.  Also, the story is centered around the time when princess Diana had her fatal accident and how the monarchy responded.  Enjoy this short drama (93 minutes).<br /><br />Now I can say, I understand why the Brits say \\"God save the Queen!\\" ;-)
B000B5XOY8|5.0|First of all, I thought I had submitted a review for this but, alas, it must have gotten lost... so, without further adieu...<br /><br />This 1989 masterpiece by Tim Burton deserves 10 stars simply because of Jack Nicholson. He was born to play that part. Also, I do not recall ever reading about Joker's real name in any of the comics; but for this movie... it's Jack.<br /><br />Now, Michael Keaton was absolutely brilliant as Bruce Wayne/Batman; I would say even better than Christian Bale (who was also very good). The way he played Bruce Wayne was the same way Christopher Reeve played Calrk Kent; you looked at him and would never put the hero-alterego in the same sentence. Michael Keaton played Bruce Wayne with a very laid back persona. A perfect example is when Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale and Robert Wuhl's Alex Knox are roaming around Wayne Manor. They enter the room with all the vintage armour and they start making snide comments about Bruce Wayne. Of course, Michael Keaton quietly walks in behind them and just observes the situation. When Wuhl's character points to a suit of armour and says to Vicki \\"Where do you think he got this?\\" Michael Keaton says \\"Japan.\\" When Knox says \\"How do you know that\\" Keaton answers \\"Well, I bought it there... oh hi, Bruce Wayne.\\"<br /><br />Kim Basinger was also perfectly cast as Vicki Vale. Kim played Vicki with strength, dignity and did not show the \\"damsel in distress\\"<br /><br />But it was Jack who carried that movie. He even made Joker likable. Jack also had all the best lines in the movie. His Joker was deliciously evil!<br /><br />Joker was originally supposed to return in the sequel; I remember reading a review, a week after the movie was released, that said the sequel was going to have Nicholson return. If you remember, after Joker falls from the building, you hear a cackling coming from Joker's pocket; Commissioner Gordon reaches into Joker's pocket and removes the lucky deck that Joker carries with him. The review said that as long as Joker had his lucky deck, he'd be back. I guess that Warner Brothers were too cheap to give Jack the money he wanted.<br /><br />Before I end this review, I will also add some information that a friend of mine from a while back told me. He said that before Nicholson and Keaton were cast, there is footage of David Bowie as Joker and Peter Weller as Bruce Wayne/Batman. That would be interesting...had his lucky deck, he'd be back. I guess that Warner Brothers were too cheap to give Jack the money he wanted. <br />Before I end this review, I will also add some information that a friend of mine from a while back told me.

B000GG4Y32|4.0|I waited a long time for this movie to come out on DVD. It tracks an era of both European and American history replete with political idealism, centered about the personalities of John Red and Louise Bryant. By today's cynical standards, the story seems quaint. But seen in the tradition of the best of political literature of that era, it's a gripping portrait of the innocence and idealism that gave birth to a fatally flawed political and social experiment. Overlong, it tends to drag a bit, but still worth buying.
B000JLSLZG|4.0|I own Excalibur on the original VHS and SD-DVD version. I notice that the HD-DVD version is still the open matte widescreen which means that it was filmed full frame and black bars are actually added to the top and bottom of the screen to produce the widescreen. Sad thing is, my VHS copy is actually a more complete version of the film. Next time you watch notice how in some scenes the tops of heads are chopped off. I realize that some open matte (or soft matte) films are shot with the intention of the audience only seeing the film in the correct aspect ratio. However I don't like the way Excalbur looks in the open matte widescreen format. Another film that's open matte is Bride of Re-animator. That's how I learned of this format. When I went to fast foward the black bars actually disappeared. It had the wide/full option and when I switched to full low and behold I saw more of the film. If you are interested in reading more about this then research Open Matte Widescreen online.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I FOUND THIS MOVIE TO BE MUCH BETTER ENTERTAINMENT THAN THE MOVIE ENTITLED THE PRESTIGE. IT HAD SUSPENSE, ROMANCE AND APPEARED TO  BE MORE CREDIBLE.ALL IN ALL, IT OFFERED MAGIC AND DRAMA AND THE ACTORS WERE VERY CONVINCING IN THEIR ROLES. IT'S A HEARTWARMING PORTRAYAL.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Yes, when I first sat down and played the \\"LOVE\\" audio DVD through headphones on my computer, I almost felt as if the Beatles were once again all alive and well, and had re-arranged, re-recorded, and re-mixed some of their great old tunes, somehow making them sound virtually like new songs! The sound on this disc is amazing...so clear and present.  I've never heard the \\"lad's\\" vocals or instrumentals sound as good! In many cases, these versions actually eclipse the original released recordings...and that's not easy to do!   <br />     What \\"LOVE\\" did for me was to give me a whole new appreciation for how great this band really was, and for the incredible songs they wrote.  It's not surprising that the Beatles' genius comes through in this album, since when it comes to the recording studio, George Martin has always been the \\"fifth Beatle\\".  The band's recording genius has done it again! Congratulations to George and his son, Giles....and Long Live the Beatles!!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I purchased this Dvd to loan to others who have not seen this very important presentation when it was in theaters.  I found the update by Gore on what has been learned since the original filming to be very informative and chilling.  I feel that everyone who hasn't seen this, needs to do so.  It is that important!
6305428271|5.0|This is without a doubt one of my all time favorite movies. <br />The first time I saw it I was 10 years old. That was back in 98. I watched it every time they showed it on TV. And when I found it on DVD I got it right away. <br />This is a must see film. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the role of a teacher wanting to make a difference in some poor kids' lives. It might sound cheesy but you really have to watch the movie yourself and I'm sure everyone will be blown away by how great this movie is! <br />I don't give good reviews and that's why I never do it, but I just had to say something about THIS movie!
0743454537|3.0|I just read the entire book in one sitting, which I suppose is measure of a book being at least entertaining, if not necessarily *good.*  My opinion pretty much echoes that of LA Mama's - the love story was forced and unnecessary, as was Jesse's plot line.  The ending was so cliched it could have been a Hallmark movie.  As someone in the medical field, I appreciate that Picoult seems to have researched the subject thoroughly, but I found myself distracted by little errors.  For instance, 82 stitches to sew a laceration 1.5 inches long??  It wouldn't take 82 stitches to sew up an entire abdomen.

1582432678|3.0|The first three quarters of this book was slow moving and boring.  It established that the mother was cold, resentful and jealous of her son Kevin.  She was angry even through the pregnancy because she couldn't drink or travel and found no bond after the birth.  The child could clearly tell that the mother did not want him.  As time progressed, it became clear that the child had other issues that even a loving mother might not be able to overcome.  He was still in diapers at age six and refused to eat so that the mother would leave food as you would a dog and he would eat it after she was gone.  He had an extremely loving father who refused to see any possibility that something was wrong with Kevin which caused extreme stress in the marriage.  It was a very sad story with a tragic ending that is impossible to predict what would have changed the outcome.
B000003TA4|5.0|In the movie Almost Famous, the character Lester Bangs declares that in 1973, \\"rock is dead\\". Perhaps he was correct in that statement. Perhaps \\"rock\\" really was dead in 1973. That's perfectly fine with me. But in September of 1991 when this album was released, something called \\"grunge\\" was about to emerge, and \\"grunge\\" definitely sounded like rock's kid brother.  <br /> <br />At first glance, and listen, this album is hard to understand, and hard to get into... That is all part of its pure genius. If you buy this album, listen to songs like \\"Polly\\" or \\"Lithium\\" while looking at the lyrics online...you'll be able to scratch the surface of perhaps the most damaged soul to ever step on stage.  <br /> <br />This album follows the masterpiece of an album \\"Bleach\\" which was not very commercially successful, but is a staple addition to any Nirvana fan's collection. \\"Nevermind\\" literally is Kurt Cobain. In every sense of the word. It is his magnum opus, his Mona Lisa. Kurt painted a picture of a person with so much pain and suffering, without actually picking up a paintbrush. This album is the early 90's, and this album is Kurt Cobain. If you are interested in one of the most influential records to come out of the past 20 years, Nevermind is what you are looking for. <br /> <br />Nevermind is exactly what the everyday CD purchasing-aholic is looking for. A CD with influence, pizzazz, a famous icon at the forefront, countless behind the scenes stories and innuendoes, a single that changed the course of popular music as we know it, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", and several other stellar songs surrounding it on the playlist. What makes Nevermind such a good buy is simple really, every song is a classic, and every song stands out for some reason or another as good. Highlight's include the previously stated \\"Polly\\" and \\"Lithium\\", along with \\"Come As You Are\\" and the less popular but equally amazing, \\"Territorial Pissings\\".  <br /> <br />To finish up, if you enjoy rock and roll music, want to hear some of the best music to come out of the last 20 years, are interested in finding out why RollingStone Magazine chose Nevermind as the 17th greatest album of all time, out of 500, you should purchase this album.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I can't say Jared Leto failed me in the acting world. His roles in Lord of War and Requiem for A Dream were excellently done. However, this review isn't  of Leto. Most actors and actresses make forays into music and create sub par albums and achieve following in other countries (David Hasselhof for instance). A Beautiful Lie is the first album I've heard from 30 Seconds to Mars and I can safely say I don't believe them to be sub par. Leto's singing is quite good and ranges from angry and loud to haunting and soft. The band  musically ranges from hard rock in \\"The Fantasy,\\" to incorporating violins and acoustic guitars in the ballad-esque \\"A Modern Myth.\\" I think their musical depth and creativity are key points in why I keep coming back to this album. I'd recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a bit of something different, maybe to change up their musical rotation.

The picture on this HD version is so much better, with richer colours and much higher clarity. <br /> <br />The DTS seems much better quality as well. <br /> <br />Best of all for us though, with no region code on HD-DVD we can now import discs from the US months before they are released in the UK and they are often cheaper even when postage is taken into account.

I was ripped off.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller but the seller didn't have the guts to reply.<br /><br />So this is my 1st bad experience with buying through Amazon or people selling through Amazon.<br /><br />I don't blame Amazon at all. This was an independent seller.
B00005JNS0|4.0|I've seen pretty much every Disney movie ever made, to include the live action and made-for-TV movies.  I grew up with them, and AM a grown-up that still loves them.<br /><br />That being said, I was very disappointed with a slew of movies released by the company in the late 90's and into the early 00's.  They seemed empty, mere gimmicks for marketing and devoid of any sort of viable plot.<br /><br />After seeing some of the initial reviews for this movie, I knew I had to check it out.  It was rated VERY highly, and I hoped that so many people couldn't be wrong about this movie.<br /><br />This movie was incredible.  The animation is top-notch (computer animation has come a long way since Tron and The Last Starfighter). The voices are definitely on the mark for the characters.  And the plot...simplistic, but it's nice to see solid growth in the main character and a good resolution, with a little ribbing on the sourpusses of the movie.<br /><br />Cars is more than just watchable...I've seen it several times, and have noticed new things going on every time.  This is definitely a positive direction for Disney, and I hope they keep it up.

057109659X|3.0|OK, so all the reviews so afr are glowing, so I'll be a bit contrary. First, the text and history are great, and the writing is clear. The author was obsessed with his subject, and was a true historian, so from that perspective the book is worth buying. <br /> <br />I have two criticisms: <br /> <br />1) Petty - there is a lot of repetition of knots. Two half-hitches appears at least 3 times, and others are repeated as well. <br /> <br />2) My major criticism is about the quality of the drawings. I do not agree that his illustrations are uniformly \\"clear\\". While most are fine and a few are excellent, some are abysmal. A novice to knot-tying will have trouble with many of the drawings. Also, the knot drawings are sprinkled with silly little whales, etc. which I find irritating. <br /> <br />Bottom line - for the knot historian/lover, the book is terrific;however, if you just need to learn some knots, a much better (and cheaper) choice is the Morrow book. Des Pawson also has some great knot books.

B000H305U0|5.0|I LIKE THE ENTIRE CD.  I HAVENT GOTTEN BORED WITH LISTENING TO IT YET <br />
B000002MIY|4.0|This album, the sophomore effort by Steely Dan alum Fagen, is not nearly as enjoyable as [[ASIN:B000002KXV The Nightfly]] (his first effort) but there are a couple of flashes of brilliance on this album; Snowbound and On The Dunes are truly great songs that strike deep. Springtime, Tomorrow's Girls and Florida Room are most definitely enjoyable. The remaining 3 songs are good listening, especially if you are a danfan, but they lack that special something that I have grown accustomed to hearing when I listen to Fagen, Becker or Steely Dan.<br />Overall, a good album and a must have for any Steely Dan fan; Nightfly would have been hard to beat, so I cannot really take away from Fagen on this album, but rather just state that he set the bar a little too high on his first outing.
0446677450|5.0|I can't beleive that some people dislike this book.  It is the best book that I have ever read other than the bible.  It motivated me to buy 2 income producing properties last year.  I have bought about 10 copies (2 for myself after I loaned it out, and several for friends and family).  Everyone loves it that I know.  I will soon be rich as a result of Robert Kiyosaki's teachings.  I highly recommend this book. <br /> <br />
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I heard \\"Crazy\\" on the radio and I thought that someone had remixed a Marvin Gaye song that I had never heard.  The song sounds like old-school mo-town with a new-spin backtrack.<br /><br />I immediately went online and found out what I could about this song and the CD.  Amazingly, I loved it.  I say amazing because I do not like pop music; as a matter of fact, I don't like most current music.<br /><br />This CD has a few songs that are a bit too much for me, but over all I love the CD.<br /><br />Here is how I would break down the album.<br /><br />Fantastic Songs; those which make the album great - Crazy, St. Elsewhere, Smiley Faces, Just A Thought, Who Cares?<br /><br />Good Songs; those which fill out the album without destroying it - Go-Go Gadget Gospel, Gone Daddy Gone (a remake of a Violent Femmes song which I didn't care for, but this version is OK), Feng Shui, Transformer, Necromancing, Storm Coming, The Last Time<br /><br />OK Songs; the 2 that I don't care for - The Boogie Monster, On-line<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a great CD in a sea of releases by clones and copycats who are unimaginative and/or untalented.  Most music today sounds like every other song from it's genre.  Music has not felt inspired in a long time but this CD has broken the mold for me, an old-school music lover.  The music, even sampled which I usually hate, takes on a life of it's own.  Listen to the lyrics too because they are pretty deep.  These guys have proven that music can still be original, lyrics can be something other than contrived and ambiguous.<br /><br />My wife says I am closed-minded when it comes to music.  She is right.  With very few exceptions, I only like music from before 1980; classic rock, mo-town, jazz, blues, swing, classical; to me, everything else seems like regurgitated, processed crap.  I have found very few albums that were released after 1980 that I liked.  Thankfully, this duo has proven that creativity is still alive in an industry that capitalizes on the popular without any desire for original art.<br /><br />This album is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale and stagnant musical landscape.that capitalizes on the popular without any desire for original art. <br /> <br />This album is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale and stagnant musical landscape.
B000784WMW|2.0|I bought the Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of Jane Eyre, but it doesn't ship until later in the month.  I decided to puchase the 1983 adaptation in the meantime to get my Jane Eyre fix.  However, I was very disappointed in the settings and the portrayal of Jane. I thought there was no chemistry between Ms. Clarke and Timothy Dalton, and at times it was almost painful to watch the two of them together in certain scenes.  I did like Timothy Dalton as Rochester, but he definitely needed another Jane to play against his Rochester.  <br />
B000002L42|5.0|The only possible complaint about this disc is that it simply does not contain enough songs. Granted, when you have a library of music that encompasses around 100 songs it is difficult to include everything.<br /><br />But, as a huge SD fan, of course I would love a live CD with all my favorites (and that is pretty much all of it). The recordings are not mixed perfectly, but the sound is crisp and clear. I recently saw the boys live and the concert was LOUD! I guess there is no way to box that live sound that hits you in the chest and makes you actually feel the music.<br /><br />Still, a great album nonetheless, with a great mix of their catalog from the seventies. Definitely a perfect 5 out of 5.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never seen an episode of \\"Firefly\\" before buying this series.  I had only seen \\"Serenity\\" in theatres when a friend forced me to go.  After seeing the movie, I had to admit that my interest was peaked.  I finally broke down, bought the series, and after the first few episodes, I stayed up the rest of the night and well into morning watching the entire series. <br /> <br />Joss Whedon's \\"Firefly\\" is, without a doubt, one of the most engaging, entertaining, and unfortunately, short-lived series on television.  The cast is phenomenal, the writing is classic Whedon, and the story is one that should have been given a decent chance to find an audience for god's sake.   <br /> <br />If you want a good piece of television history, purchase the complete series of \\"Firefly\\".  It's definitely money well spent.
B000E5N62U|4.0|Fagen has crafted some true works of art on this, his 3rd solo album.<br /><br />The best track on the album is definitely H Gang with it's heavily jazz influenced rock sound. It's like a jazz jam session gone horribly (read to mean wonderfully) wrong. The title track is nothing special.<br /><br />What I Do, Brite Nitegown, and Mars Shut The Garden Door are also truly inventive and enjoyable treks in to the jazz/rock world of Fagen's creation.<br /><br />The remaining tracks, The Great Pagoda of Funn, Security Joan, and The Night Belongs to Moana are certainly enjoyable but don't spark any great chord with me.<br /><br />Still, as a life-long Dan-fan, I am happy to hear anything that Fagen puts down and can only hope for more of the same.<br /><br />This was not a classic like Fagen's debut, The Nightfly, but it is a good album with moments of brilliance.
B00003W8NM|5.0|It's time to bury your unimaginative notions, this is not a movie about barfights or underground brawls.  Fight Club has carved such an integral niche amongst the great psychological masterpieces ever put on the screen.  Unjustly labeling this feature a \\"boxing movie\\" is insulting.<br /><br />There is a great deal of fighting going on in this story though.  Not merely physical altercations. It suggests that lots of people are unknowingly on the brink of self-destruction and are in need of some sort of outlet.  It also points out the absurdity of the American lifestyle.<br /><br />With all the intricate layers, this is a movie you can watch repeatedly and always pick up something new.  It really has developed a cult following.
B000002KXV|5.0|In retrospect, this is by far the best of Fagen's solo efforts; a true masterpiece from start to finish.<br /><br />Fagen lays down a smooth, heavily jazz laced CD with the focus being on the piano and vocals. My favorite track by far is the title track, but I.G.Y., New Frontier, and Walk Between the Raindrops (a throwback to the 50's big band sound) all have that special something that can only be described as Steely Dan.<br /><br />The entire CD leaves nothing to be wanted; except MORE of the same.<br /><br />It is a crime that Fagen's solo work has not gotten the critical acclaim as his other little project (you know, a little band called Steely Dan) because this album is stellar.<br /><br />An instant classic from the day it was released, and now a true classic almost 20 years later.

B0000028PL|5.0|Living Colour's original sound from their first few albums (Vivid, Time's Up, Biscuits) was just incredible. These guys had it figured out. My biggest regret in regards to this band is that I did not see them play live before they split up.<br />Flash forward (or, in retrospect, back) to \\"Stain\\", their last full album release, and you have a totally different sound. Anger, rage, power, bitterness, blown through your speakers (or headphones) without regret or apology. The CD is pure, raw emotion and it is amazing. If you liked Living Colour's orignal sound (i.e. Cult of Personality), you may find this CD to be a little hard to swallow. But if you love hard rock with jazz infused bass lines and a drummer that can deliver a backbeat from hell, plug in, hold on and enjoy.<br />Living Colour continues to record and tour with changes in the line-up, but the power of \\"Stain\\" will never be duplicated. Truly a rock & roll classic.
B00000I8BX|5.0|This ablum had a deeper inpact on me then most people im sure, aside from the journey we get taken on right from the getgo as we have come to expect from all of their albums, this album lays out a story for us to follow which quite frankly is more believable then 99% of other concept albums out there. <br /> <br />But onto the music... wow......just wow <br />Shock - 5/5 pretty heavy opener <br />EdgeCrusher - 4/5 i love the beginning of this song <br />Smasher/Devourer - 5/5 very cool song PREPARE FOR SALVATION! <br />Securitron - 10/5 very easily the best song on this album <br />Descent - 5/5 very hypnotic guitar work here <br />Hi-tech hate - 2.5/5 definetly not my favorite song but worth a listen <br />Freedom or fire - 4/5 pretty good <br />Obsolete -  5/5 makes me want to punch someone <br />Resurrection - 5/5 if you can watch the video, its pretty sweet <br />Timelessness - 4/5 slow but good vocals <br />Cars - Im a huge cars fan so 5/5 and a great closer <br /> <br />All and all this is hands down my favorite Fear Factory album, instead of just one or two songs standing out they have managed to produce 11 songs that you could hear individually and want to hear the next song hoping it would be as good as the previous...and it is
B00003CXAW|5.0|On time.  As advertised. Can't beat that.  Better in every was than the latest released version.  Original story line more credible, and Fay Wray was far prettier than the recent lass. <br /> <br />The \\"new\\" version seems banal and vulgar.

GLOBAL WARMING WILL NEVER END, BUT WE AS HUMANS CAN IMPROVE OUR LIVELIHOOD! A great docu-movie by Al Gore.
B0007SN43U|5.0|Chris Rea can ROCK!.It starts off with the slow groove of THE ROAD TO HELL as you realize we are all stuck on the information highway jammed up with credit and poison then he slides into YOU MUST BE EVIL and you start feeling good when he lets rip TEXAS as you take this journey with his vocal range going from an unholy demon then a rocker like Bob Seger and he turns on you again with a voice of honey as you take this incredible trip from hell to heaven and THATS WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY is a perfect bridge to an album that got little play in the United States, so little that many real rocker's missed out on one of the best exports they ever let go.As it closes with TELL ME THERE'S A HEAVEN you will hit the repeat on your remote to let it all wash over you again and again.If you recall a song from the 70's FOOL IF YOU THINK IT'S OVER well it ain't and Chris Rea's vocal range on this CD is proof positive.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|the clash could not have played any better on \\"london calling\\". with the way technology was back then (even though remastered today) the clash proved they can take it up a notch by playing divergent punk music to its finest. these guys play relentess hardcore punk! great music from a classic punk band.
B000301YY8|5.0|I am usually a person who has to listen to a cd several times to even begin to like it.  I popped this in and loved it from the beginning.  I have had it in the cd player for 4 days now and have listened to it over a dozen times.  I like that it is mellow enough for me to have it on to study but upbeat enough that it keeps me focused.  The lyrics are deeper than I thought theyd be which is awesome. Very much of a soul pouring out by the artist.  I love it.  Give it a try.  You wont be disappointed.
B000J103PC|5.0|This film directed by David Frankel and based on the Lauren Weisberger novel stands out for one reason only, Meryl Streep.  The story is the oft told romantic comedy of someone getting out of college, getting their first real job, throwing themselves completely into it, losing touch with friends and loved ones only to realize in the end what's truly important.  Awwww, how sweet. <br /> <br />However, in this story the young girl just out of college is admirably played by Anne Hathaway, who luck into a job a \\"million girls would kill for,\\" Miranda Priestly's second assistant.  Meryl Streep plays Preistly, the absolute tyrant that is managing editor of the Runway magazine, the dominant fashion magazine in the world. <br /> <br />It is Meryl Streep's performance in this film that makes it absolutely riveting.  No worse boss could possibly exist in the world, and Streep is phenomenal bringing Priestly to life,  I can't possibly say enough about Meryl Streep in this film, it is amazing to watch an absolute master at work. <br /> <br />Hathaway's preformance as Andy Sachs and that of the other actors, especially Stanley Tucci as Nigel, Emily Blunt as first assitant Emily, and Tracie Thorns as Andy's friend are all solid and first rate, but Streep makes this movie a must see. <br /> <br />Nothing special about the cinematography, except for solid location shots in New York and Paris, but the soundtrack is also exceptionally strong and really fits the movie. <br /> <br />This would be a forgettable film, without Meryl Streep's unforgettable performance.  This movie and Zoolander would make a fantastic double feature of films parodying the fashion industry.
B000001DTM|5.0|You know, there are a lot of people I know who dislike U2 and Bono, but the more I listen to \\"Achtung Baby,\\" the more I wonder how that's even possible. Seriously. They did a post-punk band in their first three albums, the next two (plus the half-studio \\"Rattle\\") showing them in an anthemic stadium rock sort band, and here's the one where they seem to be having a lot of fun. In my opinion, '90's U2 is vastly underappreciated, both by the band and its fans. However, this is easily the greatest of the three released in that decade (and I'm a big \\"Pop\\" fan, mind you). <br /> <br />But these songs are timeless, inventive, and just wow-inducing. Not a single bad song in this bunch of twelve songs. It's most known possibly for the classic ballad \\"One,\\" a sort of sad track but also a very moving one. There is a passion in there that makes it timeless. <br /> <br />\\"Zoo Station,\\" \\"The Fly,\\" and \\"Mysterious Ways\\" are some of U2's heaviest songs, and they are so in an industrial way. It's got electronics but isn't quite techno in either case. It's almost got a dark sound, something I wouldn't have expected out of U2's earlier output. Even after hearing \\"MW\\" several times, I am still amazed at its sonic genius, from that opening Edge riff which is hard to imitate. <br /> <br />Then the last three tracks are all incredible, too. \\"Ultraviolet\\" is such a melodious and touching track, while \\"Love Is Blindess\\" is a perfect way to end the album, a great chillout track, and \\"Acrobat\\" is another one of U2's greatest songs. <br /> <br />U2 were a lot of things on here -- edgy, inventive, yet simple enough to connect with the masses. While Nirvana may have turned the world to alternative rock with their album in the same year, U2 were showing its next evolution. Recommended to everyone who's willing to listen to some U2. All 12 songs are great.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my favorit story from Jane Austen.  This version ( there are 4 others) followes the book closer than the others.  It even uses most of the dialog from the book.  Colin Firth is Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy.  Others have tried but failed to portray him.  Almost nothing is left out from the book.  The locations the houses the clothes and even the dances are just as they would have been at the time of the story. Some might have trouble following the dialog which is old english, but after awhile you settle in and can follow what they are saying.
1594200823|4.0|\\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" provides interesting information about mass-produced food in America, continues on with some insights to the organic market, and then fades away into somewhat boring and irrelevant trip into \\"do-it-yourself\\" eating.<br /><br />One learns that corn is an ingredient in over 25% of the 45,000 items in our grocery stores - including non-food items.  Today's hybrid varieties require corporate seed creation as farmer-generated seed productivity drops about one-third.  Iowa farms generate about 5 tons of corn/acre using hybrid seeds that provide a considerable increase over \\"regular\\" corn.  Much of this increase is through allowing planting closer together.<br /><br />Pollan goes on to tell us that the commercial process for creating nitrogen fertilizer is considered by some to be the most important 20th century invention - without it 40% of the world's population would not be able to exist.  The bad news is that  fertilizer runoff comprises the ability of blood to carry hemoglobin, and grows algae (smothering fish).<br /><br />He also reports that it takes over one calorie of fossil fuel energy to create one calorie of food (then how does ethanol production make sense?), and that the price of corn is less than the cost to produce it in the U.S.  Government price supports are responsible for this anomaly; an important side result is that these artificial low prices are also responsible for Mexican farmers unable to make a profit and thus immigrating to the U.S.<br /><br />Sixty percent of American corn ends up being used by American factory farms - mostly to grow beef.  These factory farms produce considerable pollution while the greatly reduced practice of small farmers also raising beef adds to the requirement for fertilizer.  Bottom-Line:  Today's farming makes good economic sense but is poor ecology.<br /><br />Feeding cattle corn (plus supplements and drugs) accelerates cattle fattening from 4-5 years on grass to 14-16 months.  The resulting beef also contains greater saturated fat and less helpful omega-3 fatty acids.  Thus, today's farming also creates poor eating habits.  Finally, because cattle did not evolve to eat corn, they often suffer increased bloat, acidosis, and liver problems - treated with antibiotics that also help generate superbugs and poorer human health as well.<br /><br />\\"Wet mills\\" (add water to the corn) create ethanol, starches, MSG, glucose, fructose, citric-acid, corn-oil, and gluten.  Corporations find processed foods far more profitable because they provide the opportunity for higher prices through product differentiation (eg. \\"Fruit-Loops\\" vs. \\"Captain Crunch\\").  Unfortunately, processed foods also are energy-intensive - using 10 calories of fossil fuel for every calorie of food output; yet they are the cheapest source of calories and thus further contribute to an unhealthy diet.  (Beef weight-gain requires about 14 pounds of corn/edible pound of beef gain; the ratio is only about 2:1 for chicken.)<br /><br />Since 1977, the average American caloric intake has risen 10% - super-sizing drinks have been a major contributor; and then there are those super-sized fries usually cooked in oil containing trans-fat from oil.<br /><br />Pollan then shifts to organic farming, pointing out that while its products sometimes taste better, it is difficult to prove that they actually are better for you.  The reason is that we have very limited information as to what harmful levels of various fertilizers, pesticides, etc. actually are.  What is certain, however, is that organic products cost more - even when ecological improvements (eg. moving chickens into a field after cattle have left - they eat fly larvae, reducing the need for pesticides and, with the help of straw/wood chips, help create compost).<br /><br />Unfortunately, about this point Pollan runs out of interesting material, and the book degenerates into his hapless efforts at self-feeding and philosophizing on killing animals.

B00000G3AZ|5.0|This a very Entertaining movie.  It touches the highlights of the book.  But to really do the book justice you have to have a five hour movie.  Jane Austen was a very wonderful writer.  Gwyneth Paltrow is probably the only person to play Emma.  I loved this movie before I read the book.
0440213525|3.0|Eleven year old Mark Sway only wanted to go out for a smoke and relax when he encountered a suicidal man. As he tried to stop the suicide, Mark learned a dark secret, the location of a dead senator's body. Now the FBI is after him for that vary secret, and the Mafia is after him, in hopes of silencing him. Who will get to him first? <br /> <br />The novel held a promising plot that went down hill when things were dragged out and utterly predictable. Throughout the whole 500 plus page novel, Mark debated the pros and cons of telling the FBI the location of the senator's body, which was obvious that at the end, he was going to spill it anyways. Then, throughout the whole book, The Blade (the senator's killer) was satisfied with where the body was buried, but when Mark decided to dig it up, The Blade decided on the same thing at the same time, just to add some predictable suspense. In general, there wasn't enough conflict or intrigue, while the same things kept happening over and over again. The only reason I gave this book three stars was because Mark was an enjoyable character and I enjoyed the mob aspect of the plot. <br />
0060557818|2.0|This book was recommended by a friend. Enthusiasts of fantasy novels may enjoy it, as it is readable.  The author's inversion of London had some appeal, and he knows his city well.  Ultimately, this novel failed for me.  It read too much like an extended version of a good D&D game and not enough as a piece of literature, at least for my taste.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Originally, The Masyles Brothers were only at Altamont to make a documentary about a \\"West Coast Woodstock\\" and nothing more.  Little did they know that they were going to be at the center of what the media later dubbed \\"the death of the hippie movements\\".  This film is excellent, one of the greatest documentaries ever.  It really goes into detail on how the whole Altamont concert itself was a royal screw up.  It was done with such haste and incompetence it's a miracle that they managed to even get a concert off the ground.  Altamont was a horrible location, terrible parking (there's an amazing helicopter shot where you see cars stretched for miles), and there was just an overall sense of extreme chaos.  Even when I was watching this, it was hard to figure out exactly where the stage was in terms of the stadium itself.  The promoters and the Stones themselves really wanted to one-up Woodstock.  It really had nothing to do with a West Coast \\"love in\\".  In the immortal words of Frank Zappa, they \\"we're only in it for the money\\".  Zappa, along with others, were spot on about how hippiedom was really a joke, and it was also shockingly naive, as this film illustrates.  It seems that the Stones were thinking that everything was going to work out somehow, and there was going to be a wonderful, gentle love in.  Naiveite like that can get you killed.  The Hell's Angels were given an insurmountable task here in trying to keep security at this chaotic mess.  It was foolhardy to entrust a notorious motorcycle gang with security for nearly 400,000 people.  Considering the Angels were drunk to oblivion at the time, prone to violence and insanity, the fans were lucky that only one person was murdered.  This film really captures the chaos and murder of this festival.  It shows that Meredith Hunter, the man who was killed by the Angels, did indeed have a gun, and he seemed intent on doing something or killing someone that night.  We'll never know if he really wanted to kill Mick Jagger (some speculate that's what he was there for, or it could be the Angels just wanted to pick a fight with him).  The transfer of the film here is first rate.  It's a vast improvement over muddy VHS copies.  A brilliant documentary...ger (some speculate that's what he was there for, or it could be the Angels just wanted to pick a fight with him).  The transfer of the film here is first rate.

B000I5X81K|3.0|Josh started with great stage sound.  You fall in love with his voice.  He's tested his classical, but this, Awake, has no continunity.  He bounces from one style to another.  It's painful to listen.  Who or what is leading him up and down and all over.  Hope he finds his vocal comfort zone soon.  I won't buy another of his CD until I hear he has. This music doesn't do the best for his voice at all! <br /> <br />
B000MCH5P4|5.0|This movie is a feast for all the senses and another masterpiece from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, whose debut film \\"Amores Perros\\" established him and his writing partner, Guillermo Arriaga, as talents that simply would be ignored.<br /><br />While \\"Amores\\" had a similar narrative style, it was much more consistently visceral and in your face than \\"Babel,\\" which is also a tough film but one which demands a slower pace and shows a story-teller and a director at the peak of their respective talents. They had a lot to live up to esp. after the initial critical acclaim of \\"Amores\\". While some critics/people see the movie as being a little too self-important and some even like the 4 stories (but not in the same movie) I was immediately emotionally involved from the first frame of the movie to the last because of the different stories. One could argue that its message of the need to \\"communicate\\" does not warrant the movie's perceived self-important tone, but I was easily able to overlook a possibly didactic tone at times and spent a little over 2 1/2 hours getting to know people from around the world who have universal needs and hopes and how these desires manifest themselves in a story of global scope that is brought together by one element which ties them all.<br /><br />I won't much more away as I don't like to know too much about movies before seeing them. I can say that any film student would be hard-pressed not to appreciate the use of different film stocks used to differentiate each story and even more importantly the technical/logistical prowess that must have been required to direct a production of this magnitude, working with such a diverse cultural cast, and finding a way to bring together the performances of stars and others who'd never been in a single frame in their entire lives. I want to see the film again just to appreciate the hues, esp. those used in the Japan portion of the film, with emphasis on a scene that takes place at a nightclub. This sequence is as alive as anything that you will ever see in a single frame in any movie made to date. I would compare it to Scorsese's notorious cooking/restaurant scenes in which you can almost smell the garlic coming from the television/movie screen<br /><br />Some people have complained that the movie is too long, and while the 2 1/2+ hours certainly did not fly by (unlike \\"The Departed\\" which managed to feel like it lasted much less than it did), I did not mind. Many of the scenes taking place in Morocco and Mexico required the slower pace to give the horrible events that would soon take place even more life and appropriateness in a story that is not told in a linear fashion, and unlike some movies that use a non-linear narrative for show, this one demands on this slower narrative succeeding or else it would not only be virtually impossible to tell but would take away from its big impact.<br /><br />The acting is out of this world and, with the exception of a narrative short-coming (which may very well be on the cutting room floor) that makes the talented Gael Garcia Bernal's character feel like he is making a cameo in the movie, you'll be hard-pressed to find an ensemble in any movie in any year that is as strong as this one. Adriana Barraza's performance is so moving that you'll find it hard to forget even after the movie ends. I am glad that she received a nomination as it will hopefully lead to more work by this talented actress.<br /><br />Bottom-line:<br /><br />If you don't mind long movies and want to be moved by stories the are universal and timely, you'll be hard-pressed to find a movie that does it better than this one. Is it perfect? No, but it simply can't be, although it would have it would have benefited from allowing its images to relay its \\"message\\" as some of the commentary/words (esp. at the end)that the self-importance that some see in the movie in my mind are solely the product of these touches and an advertising campaign that beat the theme to deathand sold the movie and an \\"event\\". It's a shame that for all the talk that this film has generated, it has not been seen by more people.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you hate long movies (and still have Elaine Benis from \\"Seinfeld\\" type rants when anyone mentions \\"The English Patient\\"), this is not the movie for you. All humor aside, read the Amazon review IF you need to know more details for making the choice to see this movie. That synopsis is right on the money. This also is not a movie for kids, nor anyone looking for something \\"light.\\" Go with your gut. If you think that this movie is not for you, it probably won't be. I for one loved it and think that it's too easy to call it this year's \\"Crash,\\" which in my opinion was not as \\"good\\" as \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" but was not the piece of junk that some have wanted to reduce it to.the theme to death and sold the movie and an \\"event\\".

The Law of Attraction, the importance of our thoughts, how to achieve the things we want in this life and how to serve others, be grateful.  To me it is a condensed/easily understood version of the teachings of Deepak Chopra, Catherine Ponder, Joe Vitale, Louise Hay, Wayne Dyer, all of the great life-lesson writers of our time.  This is not about religion, but it is about spirituality -- becoming the very best we can be!  Highly recommend!  and encourage sharing with your children, especially junior high and high school students!
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I like Norah Jones. She's a likeable musician/singer/songwriter. It's obvious that she has talent and that she's been trained--no argument there. But just because you have talent and training does not mean you have spontaneity or originality, or even diversity--ingredients that make you entertaining, and just maybe, a superstar.<br /><br />\\"Not Too Late\\" is Norah Jones's third album of same-sounding music. I'd rate all three of her albums 3.5 stars--she just misses being great each time around. By the time you get to the end of \\"Not Too Late\\" you might be lulled into a coma-like, pillowy sleep. Except the pillow might be your steering wheel and your sleep might be permanent as you rear end the car in front of you.<br /><br />Jones always makes half an album's worth of gems, and they are present here to in the form of what seems like an anti-war song, \\"Wish I Could\\", the dissolution of a relationship in, \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" (which sounds Tom Waits-ish, and it's my favorite song on the disc), the uptempo \\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\", the painful, \\"Not My Friend\\", the anti-George Bush charmer, \\"My Dear Country\\" and the closing title track about finding or re-igniting love.<br /><br />I lump Norah Jones in with Enya, Sarah McLachlan, Sade or Loreena McKennitt--artists that stick to their own brand name and seldome venture outside their own artistic boxes. She's reliable, dependable, but always predictable--good, but never great.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|This is a remake of the burt reynolds classic from 1974.  I've seen the other movie and liked it, so I thought I would check this one out as well.  I was suprised that I actually enjoyed this movie, and its a great remake of the film. I thought it might be a little over the top with Adam Sandler and Chris Rock, just one bad joke to another, but it wasn't. It was very similar to the original. I think the one thing I enjoyed more about this movie that the original is the fact that they had an actual soundtrack that gave it a more polished feel. I wouldn't have guessed that it would have made that big of a difference, but it does. It's like taking the imperial march out of star wars.   Burt reynolds was able to work his way into this film as Nate scarbourgh role, and did a fine job.  I enjoyed it, 90 minutes of fun.

0195067142|5.0|\\"With the Old Breed\\" is Eugene Sledge's justly famous memoir of his service as a Marine Corps rifleman at the horrendous battles of Peleliu and Okinawa during the Second World War.<br /><br />Sledge writes with a compelling candor, and compassion, of his fellow marines in the some of the worst fighting in the Pacific.  His portraits of his fellow marines, both the hardened veterans and the green recruits like himself, ring absolutely true.  Sledge's companions in K Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines are a cross-section of humanity, brave and afraid by turns, often humorous, devoted to each other and quite occupied with the struggle for survival. Sledge pulls no punches in describing the no-quarter fighting that prevailed at that stage of the war with Japan, including atrocities on prisoners and the suffering of the wounded on both sides.  Sledge is able to capture the small details that make the story real for the reader.  Through it all, Sledge is as steady and as matter of fact as a narrator as a man sitting at his own kitchen table.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended as one of the outstanding individual memoirs of the Second World War.
0671027344|5.0|I loved reading this and hated approaching the end.   This book touched me somewhere I never knew existed.  I loved all the characters no matter how flawed.   The only perfection that existed in this book was from the flaws of the characters.   We all know these people.   I wanted a sequel...an update.  Now, I've come to realize that it would do nothing but disappoint me.  Ruin this cultural gem.   I'll never forget it.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|John Mayer has shown his virtuoso talent on an accoustic guitar before, raw mastery of the instument, no pedals, no special effects. Now he pics up a Stratocaster, follows in the shadow of Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan and shows he can totally emulate that level of mastery on an electric guitar. Like other super groups before him the tightness of a band of talented musicians shines true on this album. Pino Palladino is one of the greatest bassist alive today having the level of talent to fill in for Entwistle on the recent Who tour and weaving himself effortlessly into the syncopated laid back up front dichotomy that is the genius style of Steve Jordan on drums. Well worth a listen. PLAY IT LOUD!!!!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae is an extraordinarily talented R&B singer from Leeds, England. She was the second artist to be extensively promoted through Starbucks in the past year (the first was Sonia Kitchell). I first found out about Corinne through a Starbucks \\"Hear This Now!\\" e-mail. Corinne's background in her church choir, studying of classical violin, and stint working in a jazz club lend her a unique sound that melds various genres, including jazz, blues, neosoul, and hip-hop.<br /><br />Her self-titled debut album consists of eleven tracks heavily influenced by 1970s soul, but more modern hip-hop influences weave in and out. Vocally, she's been compared to Macy Gray, Billie Holiday, and Lauryn Hill. Interestingly enough, I found several strong similarities between Nelly Furtado's debut album Whoa, Nelly! and Corinne Bailey Rae, which made me appreciate the forward-thinking production on Whoa, Nelly that is echoed here.<br /><br />Corinne deserves all the Grammy awards she can get. England seems to have better luck in producing new veins of R&B: taking risks to reinvent it, rather than the current American R&B scene, which to me so often feels stagnant and repetitive. Her spirited delivery and nod to vintage soul (echoes of Stax and Muscle Shoals in the bright horns) is sure to please fans of neosoul, and is a perfect album to relax to at the end of a hectic day.

B000KCHZK6|4.0|Norah Jones is one of the freshest \\"talents\\" within the music industry today. Her crossover appeal is unmissable due mostly to the timbre of her voice which features sensibilities that appeal to the jazz, vocal, country, folk, and pop worlds.  Even one examining \\"Turn Me On\\" from her debut COME AWAY WITH ME will hear an R&B influence, most likely influenced by Jones's admitted listening of Ray Charles during her youth. Face it, Jones is what's going on in the music industry; she starts with an album that starts in the lower echolon of the Billboard 200 charts and explodes to #1 with 600,000+ copies after her massive album of the year win (COME AWAY WITH ME). How does she follow up such a successful album where both quality and commercial success is concerned? She releases FEELS LIKE HOME, which is quality, though not as fun as COME AWAY WITH ME nor as jazz tinged.  However, with six consecutive weeks at #1 and an opening week anybody would love to have (1.02 million), Jones managed to wrack up another grammy from the album.  So now after 3 years, Ms. Jones returns, though the return doesn't appear to be as 'big'.  NOT TOO LATE opens at #1, but with a surprisingly meek 405,000 copies (still exceptional by any means, but 600,000 copies off of FEELS LIKE HOME) and perhaps the slightest bit weaker than her other efforts.<br /><br />NOT TOO LATE isn't a bad album by any means, but it doesn't trump Jones's previous efforts.  NOT TOO LATE is different from the other two, which is a good thing, but one wishes that more of Jones's jazz edge would return on NOT TOO LATE that was almost non-existant aside from a couple of numbers on her FEELS LIKE HOME.  It does in some instances, but most times its more of a crossover, cabaret mix.  On the exceptional track \\"Sinkin' Soon\\", that works wonders, making it the track we wish had been on COME AWAY WITH ME.  Other times, you get the feeling that Ms. Jones drabbles too much in her folk-alternative country endeavors and it leaves you wanting more assertion as opposed to the soft performance that Jones gives you.  Sure, it is soothing, but it never really excites you.<br /><br />\\"Wish I Could\\" is a very nice opening track which features a lovely mix of acoustic guitars coupled with Jones's inescapable vocals.  The folk feel turns out to be an exceptional way to start the album, similar to \\"Sunrise\\" on FEELS LIKE HOME. The background vocals are very 'ethereal' feeling and just 'breathe' over the listener. The listener feels a sense of resonance and warmth while listening to this great opening number. However, again like FEELS LIKE HOME, it is the second track that steals the show, the exceptionally innovative \\"Sinkin' Soon\\", which for me ranks as one of Jones's career high-points.  The track has an incredibly cabaret feel, but it is that feel that is so endearing about it.  The use of horns highlights the greatness even more.  The bluesy piano work here gives the whole ambience of the 1930s-40s vaudeville acts.  Sure, its a novelty song, but it is a very good one that I haven't been able to stop playing.  \\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\" has to follow in the footsteps of two truly great numbers and it fails to truly resonate the same with the listener.  It is by no means bad (nothing Norah does is bad), but it is average in comparison to \\"Wish I Could\\" or \\"Sinkin' Soon\\".<br /><br />\\"Until The End\\" is very bluesy in quality with a mix between a folk sensibilities, blues, and a soul song.  It stands out among the top numbers of NOT TOO LATE.  The organ within the production coupled with Norah's splashes of piano make \\"Until The End\\".  \\"Not My Friend\\" follows and highlights Norah Jones unique voice very well.  Great is the use of different sounds in the background of the brief number;  even greater is the fact that they never steal away from what Jones does vocally. \\"Not My Friend\\" isn't bad in the least, though it doesn't stand up as tall as the truly great \\"Thinking About You\\", another defining moment ofJones's career. \\"Thinking About You\\" for me represents what makes Norah Jones that star that she is -- her bluesy nature. The groove established here is top rate and the arrangement is exceptional.  The slow tempo and the laid-back feel is what makes this track-- it hearkens back to \\"Turn Me On\\" from COME AWAY WITH ME or \\"What Am I To You\\" from FEELS LIKE HOME.  What makes it different from those two is that I think that this track maybe even better- the horns and the production work here add a completely different dimension.  \\"Thinking About You\\" was definitely that right choice for the first single from NOT TOO LATE and is the strongest performance of the entire disc.<br /><br />\\"Broken\\" returns Jones back to a more folksy edge, but surprisingly an electric guitar is incorporated here as opposed to acoustic.  The track ends up being a nice mix of both the acoustic/electric worlds.  It isn't a strong as the strongest of NOT TOO LATE, but it is above par.  \\"My Dear Country\\" resurrects the \\"vaudeville\\" feel of \\"Sinkin' Soon\\", only this time via solo piano work.  It is a very chilling performance, and you can't help but to instantly feel the potence when Norah sings \\"There's nothing as scary as election day\\". It is a truly beautiful performance.  \\"Wake Me Up\\" returns Norah back to the earthy-folk feel, but it doesn't truly bring anything new to the table.  \\"Be My Somebody\\", on the other hand, proves to be fresher and bluesier-- well in a folksy way.  Here, Jones's vocals are as strong as ever and the wailing organ in the background makes it that much stronger.<br /><br />\\"Little Room\\" is nothing new, but not bad.  \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" turns out to be a surprise with it's very calming mood.  The groove is very slow and that brings out the soulful quality.  The instrumentals are just as important, dire to the track as Jones's vocals here.  The country quality is very apparent here.  The album ends with the title track \\"Not Too Late\\", which like the conclusion or her other albums, is a piano-centric number. It isn't the best of the album, but it is a fine enough way to end the album, and it is an enjoyable listen.<br /><br />So, NOT TOO LATE isn't as good as COME AWAY WITH ME and arguably FEELS LIKE HOME, but it is a strong album that should please Norah fans.  To say that NOT TOO LATE will bring about new fans might be an overstatement, but she shouldn't lose current fans who have been with her since her COME AWAY WITH ME days.  What may hurt Norah is the fact that as great as \\"Thinking About You\\" is, fans my still argue she hasn't had a hit the likes of \\"Don't Know Why\\" since \\"Don't Know Why\\".  NOT TOO LATE should do what its meant to do, and Norah does differentiate it from her other albums, even if the influences of both still are strikingly present on NOT TOO LATE.  3 ½  Stars.moment of Jones's career. \\"Thinking About You\\" for me represents what makes Norah Jones that star that she is -- her bluesy nature.

0679746048|5.0|This fast, yet weighty read is truly amazing. Maybe you've seen the movie with Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, and maybe you haven't, but you should definitely read this amazing memoir it is based upon. Susanna Kaysen succeeds in presenting the world both unlike and similar to ours, it's at times scary. What is truly amazing is the fact that she manages to pull off this laid back, humorous look at the problems of \\"insane\\" teenagers during one of the most problematic eras in America. It is hard to keep your cool when talking about promiscuity, depression and suicidal thoughts, but this book reads so lively, your thought momentum will most probably not be interrupted. When talking about the look of the clinic where the real victims of the '60s were kept, she calls it \\"Topography\\"; when talking about her diagnosis, Borderline Personality Disorder, the reader wonders if that is exactly what is wrong with his life at the moment. Besides wittily elaborating on its unordinary setting and its characters, this nifty little book also asks some serious questions - what defines promiscuity, emotions, and of course - what is sanity?
B000I5XOVY|5.0|This blue-ray dvd brings all of the already excellent aspects of the original movie to new dimensions with better video and audio quality.
B000H0MKGK|2.0|I respected his deep articulate approach to music, I thought he was an artist who had a profound sense of self-awareness; genuine and authentic, someone with a \\"real' & \\"original\\" touch. But then i play his music at this somewhat intellectual gathering then one guest says,\\"who's that? John Mayer? Yeah that's the guy going out with that Simpson bimbo!\\". People cracked jokes,laughed, yet I was in shock, I couldn't believe it, for me he's this special underground artist who supposedly evolved from his old music and got recognised for his talent in his latest album, however, not anymore, I am sorry, I can't feel his lyrics and music the way I use to, I have a different perception of him as an artist. He's typically shallow, common and fame-struck. I am doubting his musical abilities now. He probably has many creative people working for him like the rest of those \\"big\\" artists.  <br /> <br />
B0008JFMFQ|4.0|Excellent movie, lots of action scenes to thrill the eyes. A must have for Jet Li and Zhang Ziyi fans.
B0002B15XI|5.0|This was a good product. I like the Movie and enjoyed the DVD very much. The service was execellent. I received the iotem sooner than the stayed amount of time.
0143036742|1.0|I wonder why this book is such a success. I find it poorly written and not funny at all. The title is eccentric and totally misleading.
B000M4RG42|4.0|I have enjoyed this movie, this ain't a masterpiece but it is pleasant to watch, the action is very good, almost as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" <br />The post war scene are the weakest part of the movie, I have feel no emotion in the acting, this affect my appreciation of the movie. <br />Overall, it is a good one and with a good message, about heroes. <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I already knew most of the information presented in this film as I've taken a few environmental courses in college. This is a wonderful film regardless, especially for people who are oblivious to the environmental factors presented here. Al Gore is actually pretty funny and the film has cute little cute scenes.
0440178002|5.0|This book is spectacular. And so not to spoil anything, I will say that it's worth every cent. This book has many intricate plot lines and when you begin getting bored (there are scenes with rather dense dialogue at times) something new and exciting always pops up. Such as lots of talk and then \\"suddenly on the horizon there was a brilliant fire...\\" etc., etc., <br /> <br />This book is a great beach book and also it's longer than Les Miserables (which I have also read) this book is easy to fly through. I highly recommend it for ages 13+. <br /> <br />Beware parents if you don't want your kids exposed to gore or sex too soon, but other than that, this book is definitely for all.
B000BC8TBE|5.0|I love this CD!  This is one of my favorite Christmas CD's because there are several good songs.  I actually had this on cassette when it was first released and I haven't gotten tired of it after all these years.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|A good and faithful interpretation of Austen's book.  I found Captain Wentworth more stern in character than I had envisioned reading the book but Anne was lovely.
B000002KXV|5.0|I'm a big Steely Dan fan, but I didn't get Fagen's The Nightfly until this past year. My first impression was, 'hmm this sounds like Steely Dan sort of, but sounds a bit upbeat, even happy.\\" Not that any of Steely Dan albums were depressing, but the songs sounded definitely different than Steely Dan's other songs and I wasn't sure I liked it. <br /> <br />I put it aside for awhile, but started listening to it here and there, and you know what? It's great, even better than some of SD other albums. I like the 'concept' of this concept album. All the songs follow a 1950-60ish theme and together create a cohesive album. I.G.Y is a great opening song, New Frontier is a catchy song, and the title song 'The Nightfly' is probably the best. They are all good though, even the 'weakest' of the bunch, the last song 'Walk Between Raindrops'. It's only 2 and half minutes long and uses relatively simple melodies, but it's a joy to listen to and closes the album out superbly.  <br /> <br />I never really understood what a good 'engineered' album really was until I heard this album (yes, even after hearing and loving Aja). Everything is put together great, 'slick' to use the term, crafted intelligently to produce the classic album Fagen released to us.  <br />
B000002G6J|5.0|As for the Amazon editor reviewer, I cannot imagine what kind of dead soul would say that these arrangements approach stale cheese. I pity people who cannot find their feelings under the weight of their infotainmentized pseudo-intellect. It's a gorgous piece of work, Ogerman's orchestrations and all, and if it approaches kitsch, well, that would only be true for minds who grew up having second-hand lives and experiences from growing up on TV and 'simulated living' - that pitiful Tarantino crowd of arrmchair weasel critics.   It's true that Jobim had some less than stellar albums, but this was not one of them.  Stick that up your Sunporch Cha-Cha-Cha.

B00009V7T2|5.0|You are in the market for something truly original, and you are willing to play it twice before listening, and you love great vocals, fabulous melodies and a hint of Hendrix.  Give this a try.   <br /> <br />I have had this CD in my car for a month, running.  I have not had a cd capture my imagination like this for years!   <br /> <br />Warning.  If you only like stuff that sounds like everything else you've heard, don't bother.
B000000OTY|5.0|Some groups strain so hard to come up with something creative and complicated when they are in a recording studio that new songs often sound more cluttered to me than a performance live before an enthusiastic audience, which helps listeners identify the high points. I often thought that musicians like to play the same song longer than new music is expected to be when new tunes are packaged in an album. I have a learning curve that requires a certain amount of time before I can get into new music so that I hear it as a presence that it echoes with anticipation in my mind. A set that comes with two discs is perfect for me if it comes with a few long songs on disc 2.<br /><br />Great on all of the reasons mentioned, disc 2 of `Secret World Live' provides the songs `Digging In The Dirt,' `Sledgehammer,' `Secret World,' `Don't Give Up,' and `In Your Eyes.' I'm glad I had the opportunity to become familiar with MTV videos of `Sledgehammer' and `Digging In The Dirt' back when a rotation of familiar music videos was one of the best things I ever watched TV for. Now listening to this brings back a lot of the pleasure. Disc 1 has concert versions of the new songs I wanted to get anyway eventually, so getting this all together made a tremendous amount of sense to me, and it still does.
B000EMGJM2|4.0|We definitely need more soulful artists like Van Hunt recognized and listened to more.  It's music that's deep and fun at the same time.  Most people are living their lives without any substance.  This kind of music helps bring substance back into our lives without sacrificing any of your enjoyment.   As much as I enjoy this cd, I don't think it's as good as Van Hunt's self-titled first album. That probably has to do with the fact that he aligned himself with American Idol Randy Jackson to help produce this album.
B00000DRWB|5.0|This is my favorite Areosmith CD. I recently saw them in concert and they still put on a fantastic show.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|That was the best pop performance I have ever seen in my life. Madonna has the best production, only compared with Petshop Boys or New Order. I definitively loved LET IT WILL BE, ISAAC made my ears bleed in a good way, MUSIC was awesome, HUNG UP amazing... I can continue, but the ones who have purchased this master piece know what I am talking about. God Bless Madonna!!! And us the fans, of course. [...]
B0001I562I|5.0|This is a Timeless movie, well worth watching over and over again.
B000H305U0|3.0|Justin Timberlake's release of Future Sex/Love Sounds is rather disappointing.  You see him on TV and magazine covers everywhere these days and one would think it's because of an amazing new album that project him above an icon like Michael Jackson.  Not so, is the case here.  Most every song is rather dull, uninteresting, and overly repetitious.    The first track that goes by the same name as the album title is probably the most unique and catchy song here.  Sure, there may be one or two other songs that may be good to listen to more than once (eg. \\"What Comes Around\\"), but none compare to the title track.  The album's singles \\"Sexy Back\\" and \\"My Love\\" are very overrated.  \\"Sexy Back\\" is sung entirely with a vocal effect, unnecessary vulgarity, and overly-done repetition that just ruin a good beat.  \\"My Love\\" is just not a good song--the first half of the song is so repetitious that the words \\"Hey\\" and \\"My love\\" are repeated nearly 200 times each (does that sound like a good song to you?).    The lack of good song writing (mainly in the lyrics) ruins this album.  Do what you can to listen to the title track, but you won't lose any sleep over missing out on the rest of this overrated album.  Listen to this CD with low expectations and you may enjoy it more.
B0002VK66U|4.0|I was a college soph in the fall of '85, tough time for metal/rock fans, VH had just called it quits and we had wade through hours of Springsteen, Dire Straits and  Talking Heads on the Radio or MTV to hear one Motley of Ratt song, salvation was still about 18 months away in the form of \\"Appetite for Destruction\\". Anyway \\"Rescue Me\\" was a good, solid, overlooked rock album. It is difficult to believe once upon a time MTV Actually aired JLT Videos But it is true. While we are on the topic of under the radar 80's music, do yourself a favor and hunt for a band called ICON  S/T and NIGHT OF THE CRIME. Excellent melodic hard rock, Really good at what they were trying to do. Kind of a blend of Ratt and Skid Row NOTC is one of my favorite records of all-time. My objectivity could be clouded  by nostalgia, But listen for yourself
B0000C8AV2|4.0|After Down in the Groove and Knocked Out Loaded, pretty much everyone thought Dylan was over the hill. Then he saved his career with Oh Mercy, a big step up from those two debacles. No, this will never compare to his '60's work: with the exception of the lovelorn Shooting Star, everything on Side 2 should be skipped. But he makes up for it with great blues-rock (Everything Is Broken; Political World) and two downbeat ballads (Ring them Bells, which literally took a year to grow on me, but I now love it; When Teardrops Fall), so this is far from a failiure.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|This album is as sensational as Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\", and Mastodon is as sensational as Metallica of the 80's!<br /><br />Absolutely number one last year, NO ONE came close, although no.2 and 3 on my list of 2006 metal's finest (Insomnium and All Shall Perish, respectively) sometimes made me think as though they had a chance of dethroning one of the most original, fresh, eclectic and innovative bands in metal and rock today. Mastodon is a musical PHENOMENON. I own all 4 of their CDs of which I have listened to 3 ONLY ONCE and I must say that each is worth every penny I spent! You would be hard pressed to classify them on any of their albums, although their \\"Remission\\" owes much more to death/industrial than to any other genre of extreme \\"crackmetal\\".<br /><br />Many musical magazines called \\"BM\\" the album of the year, and one even elevated it to the album of the decade. It is not an easy, catchy and pleasant album at first listen, though you will notice that EVERY member of Mastodon is a master of his instrument. With consecutive listens, however, you will be rewarded with plenty of melody, groove and authentic \\"something\\" that makes your skin crawl. Quite possibly an album written and executed by ancient deities in human forms...This century's Black Sabbath, period.

034544678X|5.0|I brought home a very human- and dog-reactive adult border collie from a shelter 20 months ago.  Realizing I was in waaay over my head, I went to the library, and must have read 50 dog training books over the course of a month.  Flooding - not that effective with dogs - surely isn't the way to go when learning dog training!  Choke the dog!  Don't choke the dog!  Roll him over!  Never roll him over!  Crate him!  Never crate him! <br /> <br />Patricia McConnell's book was recommended to me after a few discussions with other dog lovers.  It was the first book whose philosophy gelled with what I was seeing in my own dog.  After reading the book, I had the confidence to do what I needed:  1)  Watch my dog's body language to see how he was reacting BEFORE there was a problem  2) Protect the dog from having bad interactions and 3)  Slowly introduce him to spooky things and reward for good interactions. <br /> <br />Read it.  Study it.  Believe it.  She knows what she's talking about! <br /> <br />Anyone who has an \\"aggressive\\" or reactive dog should also read \\"Cautious Canine\\" and \\"Feisty Fido\\" by Ms. McConnell. <br /> <br />

I overlooked the blatantly sexual innuendo by Carol Burnett's character, because my 5 year old has no idea what's going on there.  But there were at least two \\"D*mn\\"s and two loud-and-clear \\"G#ddamm#ts\\"  I knew this movie was PG, but it's Annie for goodness sakes!

0143038419|4.0|If you can keep from judging the author as you are reading, this book is worthwhile.  Sometimes I wanted to cry with her; other times I wanted to slap her.  She never claims to have all of the answers or to be anything less than self-indulgent.  In fact, she clearly admits to being self-indulgent.  But at the same time, she is brutally honest for most of the book.  I was disappointed by the ending, but the first two sections of the book, Italy and India, were clever and enlightening.  I love Gilbert's sense of humor.... I laughed out loud often while reading this book, and I like that.
B0000067L2|5.0|Yes Yes. Your Metamorpho is now on a roll (with creamcheese?) with these reviews. I have moved to a dairy farm in Wisconsin to A) have peace and quiet and B) to have the right setting for this review. So, with supercilious aplomb, I modestly proffer crystal ruminations on this psychedelic masterpiece. Do I make myself clear? Hmmm.... probably not. And me in a clown wig doesn't help the seriousness measure at all. Maybe I should change to suit the masses? ........Nah.<br />Welcome to the incredible world of Disraeli Gears! This album is a giant step from Cream's debut album for a number of reasons. In it, Clapton discovers the \\"true\\" riff and the wah-wah pedal as well. He also discovers his considerable songwriting power. Does \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" do a good enough job convincing you? We have Jack Bruce contributing many, many fine tunes. And even Ginger Baker contibutes with \\"Blue Condition\\", although a great singer, he is not.<br />Add to the mix the hefty, considerable talents of Felix Papplardi (as producer and songwriter) and you wind up, not only with a giant leap, but a classic 60's album as well. He was able to harness these mega-talents, balance out their abilities in a more precise way. And the result is glorious and inspirational.<br />I should also like to point out that Cream really started to expand outwards with this album because, although holding on to that \\"blues\\" edge, they cleverly mixed in rock sensibility. What a strange brew. But it works.<br />Song by song this album moves like a well-oiled machine and to try to interpret the lyrics, at this point, would be like trying to explain hallucinations; elusive and too fast to catch.<br />But, ahhhh, the songs....... / We begin with \\"Strange Brew\\" whereby Eric's songwriting is made evident and he stirs blues and rock to forge an interesting musical concoction. Refreshing. But that is just the beginning. Clapton gives us one of the most recognizable riffs in rock with \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\". I need not elaborate. Then \\"World of Pain\\", which lilts along with the grace of Eric and Jack's shared vocals along with the wah-wah and a faux backwards lead guitar. A lesson in how to sound psychedelic without a tape loop. Bravo. \\"Dance the Night Away\\" offers interesting construction and Baker's \\"Blue Condition\\" is a slow drugery that supports the title and reflects the mood.<br />\\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" offers visions of spacey greek mythology as well as freeing Clapton to create considerable landscape with his guitar. Where does he get these leads from? \\"Swlabr\\" picks things up considerably whereby the whole trio just lets everything fly into the wind. A joy to hear. We then get to \\"We're Going Wrong\\" with an incredible, heartfelt vocal by Jack Bruce. Somber and tortured, this song rocks soft but subtle--again showcasing the various colors that each member brings to the table.<br />\\"Outside Woman Blues\\" is the most prominent blues number on the album. But, they, again, play it along rock parameters. Then the Jack Bruce jaunt blues of \\"Take It Back\\" with crisp harmonica. Frenzied, wild and free. They then end with the humourous traditional \\"Mother's Lament\\" complete with English dancehall piano and accent. A puzzling but intriguing end to this classic. Anyone out there that is interested in the evolution and fusion of rock and blues - this album is indispensable.<br />And good grief - just before I ended this review I got a call from T - my talented but confused apprentice. He is now treading water and got tangled within the seaweed of his mind. He has refused the kelp of my guide Guido (which I can't blame him for). So, excuse me while I give him advice.

1400049628|5.0|This is a great read. It takes itself so seriously, without ever relenting or conceding that it is a manual for a fictional apocalypse that anyone who has enjoyed any \\"contemporary\\" zombie story in any medium; prose fiction, films, comioc books, video games will enjoy this tremendously. <br />I also recommend it for writers and artists looking for a ready-made \\"storybible\\" to set some parameters for their work in progress. <br />You may even find yourself disagreeing with some of its observations, principles and rules, but in truth that is also part of the fun in reading this book. The moment you find yourself arguing with some strategy or physiological \\"fact\\" about the walking dead, is the moment Mr. Brooks has you-- hook, line and sinker.

B000LAZDQA|4.0|first, let me say that i did enjoy this film. very much. as a sexually open person myself who thinks that many people's hang-ups about sex (doing it, talking about it, watching it) border on the ridiculous, i found it refreshing and exciting and humorous and lots of fun. i admire and applaud john cameron mitchell for taking on such a project and actually making it happen. that being said . . . i wanted more from it. it played out like a standard issue porn flick, really: scene, scene, sex, scene, scene, sex. as it stands, you could take out all of the graphic sex scenes and it would play like a typical mainstream relationship film. i wanted something dramatic and cathartic to happen DURING the sex, some angry naked confrontation, or an intense and intimate monologue. some of my most open and frank conversations with another person have occurred before, during, or just after sex, and i wanted to see more of that. even some casual nude scenes between the actors - you can be naked with a person and not be screwing them. one of the best parts of being in a couple is the ability to \\"hang out\\" naked. granted, all the actors did a stellar job, and to appear in this film was a fairly brave thing to do. but why not push them further and really test out what they can do? the novelty of having the graphic sex in the film became almost dull after a while (maybe that was part of the point?), because none of it really, truly advanced the plot much. there were a couple great moments, though: jamie bursting into tears after his orgasm during the opening credits; the look that is exchanged between the woman being screwed in the club and the therapist watching; the older gay man talking to the young gay man in the club and then realizing that he is about to be ditched in favor of the younger, prettier man across the room (been there!); and the \\"star spangled banner\\" scene was terrific. but the therapist confessing her own problems to her patients? wouldn't happen - a very \\"non-genuine\\" scene - she should have her license taken away! and the remote control vibrator scene? i didn't believe it for a moment - true humor comes from truth, and that played very poorly - it was thrown in for the sake of a laugh, at the expense of the characters. and did i miss something: why was jamie suicidal? why couldn't the therapist have an orgasm? and how did both situations get \\"fixed\\"? or did they, really? not that everything has to wrap up nicely in a pretty bow by the end credits (i really don't mind the \\"unanswered question\\" that seems to be so verboten in american films), but these were pretty important plot points. i did like that the man in drag who owned the club got to engage in some sexy stuff himself, but i am a bit tired of the earthy, world-weary, sarcastic, seen-it-all drag queen character who imparts wisdom and witticisms to her underlings. i did have a great time watching this film, and i want to see it again (for the plot points AND the sex!), but all in all i found \\"hedwig\\" much more moving, and was hoping for more of that sort of thing in this film. maybe in \\"shortbus 2: jamie's revenge\\"? :)
0307165485|5.0|I have a much older version of this book from the early 1970s.  It was my favorite book, and when my cousin Ty was born when I was 10, I loaned it to him.  It was also his favorite.  My aunt returned the book to me, and now that my twins are nearing 3, I have entrusted the book to them.  They take turns sleeping with this book, and every night we read the Airplanes and The Crow and the Cheese.  This book is a classic that stands the test of time in our family.
B000M4RG42|2.0|As a fan of both Clint Eastwood as director, and WWII movies of any kind, it saddens me deeply to have to award this film such a low rating. But I simply cannot recommend it by any stretch.      I'll just jump right in by pointing out the films two main flaws:    #1 - the film is presented in a time-shifting manner (think PULP FICTION) that renders the material confusing and ultimately uninvolving.  There are at least four seperate time periods (the present, the first day of the invasion, a subsequent night of the invasion, and the tour back in the States of the surviving flag-raisers).  The film constantly jumps between these four time periods in random order with rarely a time-stamp to let you know where you are.  And the shifts often come right in the middle of a scene, which adds to the jarring nature.  I suppose Eastwood figured the audience would stay more engaged if the war footage was peppered throughout the film instead of concentrated at the beginning.  But this approach ultimately sacrificed the impact of the story - which leads me to point . . .    #2 - there is no emotional connection to this story or its characters.  Because we jump all around and see them at different phases of the story without understanding how they got from one point to the next, we become detached from their emotional development, and cease to care about them.  Ira, the Native American soldier, is supposed to elicit our sympathy, but he comes off as a whining drunken baby.  Doc is supposed to be our solid hero, but he comes off as a cardboard everyman who seems to spend more time staring at the scenery than letting us into his mind.  And Gagnon, after shouldering the responsibility of compiling the list of who actually raised the flag, he simply becomes window dressing as \\"the one with the girlfriend who gets married.\\"  None of these characters draw any interest because we never get to spend any consistent time with them.      And the same goes for every other character in the movie.  There are extended sequences of soldier after soldier falling to the battlefield in the throes of death while one of the three look on and hold their hands . . . and we are supposed to care about this, I suppose, only I never knew who was dying because I had never been given any information about their characters.  So, it became just a cavalcade of anonymous dying soldiers.  It's hard to sell a \\"War is Hell\\" bit when no one cares about these people.    Personally, I wish Eastwood, or those who adapted the novel, had just taken the traditional route of following these men from early training through the full invasion for about an hour and a half, and then sequentially proceeded to the American tour of the three survivors.  THEN I would have had an emotional interest in seeing how the horrors of what they endured were turned into a marketing campaign to promote the war to America (which is the film's core message).      Simply put, the time shifting kills the movie and its message.  Because so many of what should be the emotionally climactic moments occur early in the film when the viewer still doesn't know the characters, there is no reason for the viewer to care.    Adding to the confusion is the ever-changing narrarators.  First we see an old man collapse and another young man helping him.  This young man turns out to be his son (which I didn't realize until nearly the end, thanks to shoddy storytelling) who apparently goes about interviewing others in his dad's squad.  As such, throughout the film, we hear the story told by several of the old men, and finally by the son. Once again, seeing the story told by changing points of view causes detachment from any one of the characters.    But I digress.  Let's talk about the comparison this film will undoubtedly, and appropriately draw to another great war epic, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Simply put, the war footage in this film doesn't even hold a candle to RYAN.  For whatever reason, the effects of this film just scream CGI, with the image being a little too crisp and clean, and I was too often reminded of LORD OF THE RINGS rather than archival WWII footage.  With RYAN, Spielberg did a fantastic job of taking you from the boat to the beach-head, to the hill, to the bunker, and to the top, and you knew exactly where you were on that beach the whole time.  The invasion in this film is just a confusing mess.  Shot after shot of mortars firing and holes erupting dirt on the beach while men fly through the air.  Shot after shot of bullets ripping through the dirt and just catching a soldier.  Tons of generic soldiers holding their gut in, or lying in a lifeless heap.  But with all of this, no sense of where they are going, what they are accomplishing, and who is being affected.  Intercut with this are several shots from the perspective of straffing U.S. airplanes, but yet again we do not see the pilots of these planes, only the view out their windows.  These shots, like the rest, seem completely superfluous, and merely put in to show off the latest CGI effects.    In fact, another recent film has stolen the thunder of such war footage as well.  While not a World War epic, CHILDREN OF MEN ended with a spectacular single-take run through a war ravaged tenament building with guns blazing and tanks firing, bringing the character immediately into the fray, something which FLAGS simply does not do.    So, with generically bland footage, uninvolving characters and dialogue, and jarring time-skipping, there is just no reason for you to spend your time with this film.  As I say in the title, you can honestly gain the entire story from the trailer.  All the scenes that explain the purpose of the film (that these three became unwitting hero-symbols in the effort to garner support for the war) are in the trailer, and are not expounded on in any way in the movie.    Hopefully, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA will provide a better emotional journey than this disjointed effort.
0486211045|5.0|This still remains as one of the top anatomy books I use the most. I actually like the fact the figures and illustrations are not super detailed and more loose sketches. A beginner might find this frustrating, but as a person that is trying to develop my own style I find it more important you get a loose interpretation and fill in your own details and personal touch. Otherwise you'll just have clone artists of these anatomy books.<br /><br />The other reason I love this book is the price. It's small size makes it very easy to carry around too.<br /><br />I feel I've improved tenfold since I've purchased this book on making my anatomy look more real.
B00009L1UP|5.0|Man this album brings back some great times.  Saw these guys at Giant Stadium in NJ for this tour (Empire) terrific show.<br /><br />Enjoy good 90's rock, get this album.
0465092756|4.0|The first part of the book takes the reader on a brief tour of particle physics and string theory. I'm afraid that unless you already learned some of this stuff before, you'll find it hard to follow.<br /><br />The second part of the book is high-level analysis of particle physics. This is the part that makes the book so important. Woit shows how the academic funding process and human inclination to follow fashionable ideas has led the field astray.<br /><br />Especially interesting for me is the close parallel Woit draws between postmodern theory and string theory. Both have taken root in that most secular of states, California, while they are both, in fact, a religion rather than a science.<br /><br />On the whole I would recommend reading this book, especially if you are a scientist.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Hey, ladies!  If you loved \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and fell in love with \\"Mr. Darcey\\" as I did, you can relive the delight by getting this album. The musical score is stunningly romantic.  It is also very relaxing.  I use it to \\"switch gears\\" after a busy or traumatic day.  A friend with three teen daughters of her own first recommended the movie to me, then this CD.  She was right on!  And, if you haven't seen the movie, order it!  Then kick the guys out of the house, turn down the lights, and enjoy the Victorian romanticism this classic.
6304076517|5.0|Hello Everyone!  This is a Masterpiece!  Peter Greenaway is one of the greatest directors of all time.  If he made it, then buy it!  The question of the day (Or should I call it the million dollar question), Is where the Hell is the DVD for Prospero's Books?  This movie should not only be in everyone's collection, but it should be released on DVD and should be released ASAP.  Why is it that some the greatest films haven't been released on DVD yet?  Lost Highway, Twin Peaks Season 2, Return To Woop Woop, Etc.  I have heard that Twin Peaks Season 2 is coming out in April (Finally!!!!, Now I own this Season 2).  They finally released Eraserhead, Seinfeld And Delicatessen.  I'm not sure why they have to wait Sooooo long on releasing certain movies.  I own this movie on VHS and it is awesome (Like every other Peter Greenaway movie), but I want it on DVD like all of my other favorite Greenaway movies (Clean Shaven, The Pillow Book, The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover and of course A Zed & Two Noughts).  Well PLEEEEEEASE release Prospero's Books on DVD!  I want this in my collection.  If you want to really impress me, release it on Criterion Edition (With Tooooons of extras).  Thanks and watch this even if it is only on VHS.  This is one of the most surreal (Insane) movies on the planet.  A must own for kids of all ages!  Don't say I didn't warn you!!!  This movie is Insane!
0393327655|3.0|Hands down it was a great read.  However it was rather disingenuous but truly well put!  Harris uses the age-old debate technique of creating a \\"Strawman\\" in order to deliver his argument with precision.  He did this very well.  But on the other hand, reading Harris as a theologian, I found that his curt dismissal of church history rather humorous especially when it came to the documents of faith upon which christians rely.  I also found the glaringly apparent resurrection avoidance simply disingenuous - as I said at the outset.  All this is hardly answerable in a review here so in debate parlance I lose.  Once I completed with reading \\"The End of Faith\\" I was then introduced to Buddhism.  Ahh ok Sam.  Well done.<br /><br />On the other hand I truly do agree with Sam that religious fervor and misunderstanding is often the lubrication for stupidity.  But I would caution readers that poor hermeneutics is the handmaid of revolutions and of religious choices as well.  And Sam is not impervious to bad hermeneutics in this book either.  I agree with Sam's conclusion but would proffer that his premise missed the fact that it is not the problem of myth and faith that our world has so often but rather poor and shabby hermeneutics which lead to ridiculous interpretations and global conflicts.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the read but disagreed fundamentally with his premise.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|This album is going to slot right in there with my favorites !!.  The song \\"Sinking Soon\\" is in a listening class of it's own - truly superb.  But then, I cannot fault any of the songs.   After what I would have rated a disastrous experiment in `Feels Like Home', Nora returns to the music style that made her famous.  What an absolutely mind-blowing and chill inducing experience !!. I have not enjoyed an album this much since `Come away with me'. Bravo !! Bravo and  Bravo !! again.
B0002IU988|5.0|I never heard of Alter Bridge until a buddy of mine gave it to me for my Bday recently.  Wow!  Now, that I've listened to it. I can't stop.<br /><br />The sound is tight and it's a good return to a real rock-and-roll type of sound, even with great guitar solos!<br /><br />The lead singer can hit just about every note imaginable and pull them off perfectly.<br /><br />The whole album is great but tracks 7-10 are outstanding.  If you like rock and you are looking for something new or to try something new, give this album a shot.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
1572814136|5.0|This deck is beautiful!  I love the color!  It stays true to the original Rider-Waite Deck and is VERY eye appealing.  It comes with a small set of instructions inside the deck (more of a pamphlet than a booklet and definitely not a book).  The pamphlet would be somewhat helpful to someone starting off, but I would suggest getting a \\"how to\\" tarot book to companion for beginers.  There is good detail for those that read intuitively, but for those that wish to stretch beyond the traditional... you may want to go for another set of cards.  This deck is great for both those just starting out or for those that have been practicing for years.  This is definitely added among one of my favorite tarot decks.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|This just proves that most of todays pop artist will do anything to sell albums, but this is ridiculous. OK, so No Doubt wasnt the best rock band around, but they had some OK songs. What I dont understand is how you go from fronting a Rock Band, to singing bubblegum pop trash. I DO MEAN trash. I dont know if she is a Madonna wanna be, but if that is the direction she is going, then it just aint working. Even though I dont own CD's but artist such as Christina Agularia or Britiny Spears, at least when they started, they were pop singers. Gwen is nothing but a sellout doing this nonsense. I sampled these tracks and I felt sick to my stomach that this is the direction that musicians are taken today. Most of the artist are doing it, as most of todays hip-hop has been ruined by the same problem. Once well known hardcore rappers such as Fat Joe, Dr. Dre, and others start appearing as musical guest on these type of albums as well (not on Gwen's, but you get the picture) Can you imagine in the days of Dre's \\"Chronic\\", Ice Cubes \\"Lethal Injection\\" or 2Pac's \\"Dear Momma\\" if these artist appeared on bubblegum pop albums..YIKES! Even Eminem earlier material he ripped at POP music icons such as Britany, and know he is doing the same thing. Shame, Shame. Know maybe people will understand why I listen to Death Metal (amoung many other things, but its my music of choice), even though the genere can be difficult on most peoples ears, at least Morbid Angel wont be appearing on the next Brooke album...GARBAGE
B00003CXC7|5.0|One of Hitchcock's best with one of Hollywood's all time great actors, James Stewart. With a great supporting cast of Grace Kelly, Raymond Burr, Wendal Corey and Thelma Ritter, this Hitchcock classic keeps you on the edge of your seat.
6305841861|4.0|Evil Dead II is a sequel/remake to the Evil Dead, but it's much more entertaining, because of its creative comedy. This is everything a horror comedy should be and even if it's labeled as a B-Movie, I think it competes with even the A-list horror of today. In fact, a lot of the A-list horror today is crap compared to this genius. Bruce Campbell portrays Ash like you've never seen him before and he's stuck inside of the same creepy cabin with deadites everywhere, which isn't exactly for the faint of heart. Don't worry, this isn't as scary as the first one. The first half of the movie is Ash struggling to keep the Evil Dead from possessing his body. The second half has newcomers arriving at the cabin, only to find out the horror of what has happened. Everything gets possessed in this movie at least once (including inanimate objects and excluding three people). There are also actual antagonists such as Henrietta and Rotten Apple head. It's one ride that you don't want to miss if you're looking for a good time. Bruce Campbell deserves another comeback.
0618680004|2.0|The author correctly shows some of the weaknesses of many theistic apologists.  He also gives anecdotal evidence of the many instances of belief in God being used to justify outrageous evil.  But he deludes himself when he either willfully misrepresents, or simply misunderstands what defenders of theism have written.  He writes with an ignorance or misunderstanding that is difficult to accept in one of his academic background with regard to \\"irreducable complexity.\\"  The anecdotal evidence he provides to demonstrate the destructive nature of a belief in God ignores the tremendous amount of evidence to the contrary.  Furthermore, he paints with a broad brush, condemning anyone who believes in any absolute truth which he, himself, declines to accept.  Apparently the only absolute truth is his.  The main complaint about this book is that the author does not provide a rational, logical discussion of the topic, admitting the weaknesses of his position while attacking those of his opponents.  Instead, he resorts to diatribe, name calling and dismissing those who agree without truly investigating their claims.  He has reached his conclusions without a fair consideration of the evidence.

B000I2J79K|5.0|It is not possible to find something better than this show. I love it.
B000M06K5C|5.0|Do not read any other review... <br /> <br />'Weekend In The City' is a big bold move for Bloc Party. With more futuristic sound samples, dynamic guitars and intelligently written lyrics -- Bloc Party makes a tremendous album. 'Weekend' is light years ahead of Silent Alarm (as difficult as it sounds) <br /> <br />The album begins out with Kele strumming and singing \\"I am trying to be heroic...\\" while it may sound like a soft number, the band launches into a full scale slam of crunching guitars and drums. \\"Song For Clay (Disappear Here)\\" could be mistaken as a MUSE song, as it's heavy-electronic type intro, but the song expands into something else. <br /> <br />If there's a mood for this album, it's definitely a mellow one -- but it doesn't disappoint, plenty of big rock numbers, but also very sincere love soaked songs. \\"Kreuzberg\\" explains about how Kele convinces himself that he found love through a one night stand... and \\"I Still Remember\\" captures two young lovebirds observing the world outside of them. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most misunderstood song on the album, \\"The Prayer\\" is really just experimental. With it's tribe like beat, the song also feels like a song that you could sing while drunk or stoned (pending on your flavor) about confidence. Propping a great line \\"Is it so wonder/to crave recognition?\\" <br /> <br />Serious fans of Bloc Party will listen to this album non stop, and casual fans who like older songs like 'Banquet' 'Blue Light' and 'So Here We Are' should be advised to download 'Waiting for the 7.18' 'Kreuzberg' and 'Uniform' -- but this is EASILY the Best Album of 2007.
B000008ERZ|5.0|If D:A:D had come out of Seattle, Atlanta or any other US city, this album would have gone platinum several times over. I count at least 6 songs that could have gone into the top 10. The band was big in Denmark throughout the 80s and 90s (during which time I went to high school and college in Denmark) and also made a name for themselves in Australia as far as I'm aware. For some unknown reason they never had a hit in the US though. Still makes me wonder. If you're into hard rock, then you ought to reward yourself and try this album. 18 years later (sigh) and it still rocks!
0553573403|5.0|I have scanned some of the negative reviews of this book and it seems the common thread is shock over the adult content of the writing. Either that or outrage over the lack of a \\"fantasy\\" element.  It should be known that this book and this series is not G-rated Tolkien. Nor is this series a rambling fantasy epic where everyone has special powers a' la Jordan.<br /><br />What this book and subsequent series happens to be is some of the best writing in the fantasy genre I have ever read.  I have been reading fantasy for over 2 decades now and have never become so engrossed in any series as I have this one. True, I was a little put off at first by the lack of the \\"fantasy\\" element - I didn't expect a historically based fiction novel to hold my attention - but it did, and the further on in the series you go, the more \\"fantasy\\" comes into play.<br /><br />I read the Jordan series up until Winter's Heart and enjoyed the first 6 books or so but eventually realized that the story was going nowhere.  After reading Game of Thrones and the subsequent novels I finally grasped what good writing actually is. There are no cliche' characters in ASOIAF and no hokey actions like Nynaeve \\"pulling her braid\\" in anger.  Every major character is fully fleshed out and quite believable. The actions and reactions that lead to conflict are intelligent and understandable.  The \\"adult\\" content is not over-the-top and only adds to the immersion and believability of the world that Martin created.<br /><br />Admittedly, the series starts out a little slowly with this book but keep on reading and you will be glad you did. The plot twists Martin throws out are sometimes saddening and sometimes uplifting but when you finish a book you feel as if you lived it. This is by no means a feel good fantasy series where the good guy always wins and no one gets hurt. This is a novel that describes what a medevil world must really be like if thrown into conflict with unknown forces as well as other Houses.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how well written and engaging this series is but you will just have to learn for yourself.  If you are looking for a fantasy series that will keep you yearning for the next book and if you really want to see what quality writing is like, I recommend starting with A Game of Thrones.Houses.  <br />I could go on and on about how well written and engaging this series is but you will just have to learn for yourself.

B000IAZPKM|5.0|What an amazing concert DVD! I stumbled across Kamelot almost by accident. I was listening to Last.fm streaming radio, and heard a few songs by them and was intrigued, so I bought the last two CDs. Holy [...], they were good, but even those didn't quite prepare me for this DVD. This is probably the best live performance I have ever seen. The sound quality is perfect, the musicianship is perfect, the energy is awesome, the theatrical effects are great. It simply doesn't get any better than this. The absolute highlight is the performance of \\"Abandoned\\", which gave me goosebumps as I was watching.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I couldn't wait for Amy to release her second album and quickly pre-ordered it on iTunes. I wasn't quickly in love with \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" upon first hearing it. I was expecting something like \\"Bring Me To Life\\" instead. After a few times hearing it on the radio and listening to it while jogging, it quickly grew on me and I couldn't stop playing it! <br /> <br />Once the album became available for download I rushed to get it. Again, I didn't take to the new album right off the bat. It sounded a bit tweaked from \\"Fallen\\" (which is what I was expecting again). After listening through the whole album I was convinced that Amy had churned out another smash album. If your debut album makes you, your sophmore album could potentially break you. This album rocks you to the core while delivering soothing ballads in \\"Lithium\\", \\"Good Enough\\", and \\"The Last Song I'm Wasting On You\\". <br /> <br />It's rare that I like the whole album of an artist. This is one of those rare exceptions. What I'd like to see is a collaboration between Amy Lee and Cristina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil). That would be something...
6302720419|4.0|This is an OK movie. I've seen it three or four times and I decided to buy it. I didn't even bother watching all the others because movies that aren't that good usually don't have good sequals either. But this one is good enough to watch although not scary at all. Malachai is pretty cool.

B000M4RG42|3.0|Let me say I really did enjoy the movie quite a bit (was expecting more battle scenes and to be a bit more linear, but whatever), I've just got to warn people about purchasing this DVD. It might be better to wait. <br />There isn't ANY special features at all! This is probably because the studio is planning on a big deluxe package sometime later this year. If so, I will then have a pretty useless DVD which I will need to trade in. <br />Smart shoppers out there, do what I didn't do. Wait for it. This movie deserves some good special features. <br /> <br />And if the Letters From Iwo Jima DVD is going to be just as bare-bones as this, I'm really going to be upset. That's my favorite WWII movie right there. <br />
0375507256|2.0|The book just seems like six short stories to me, only interlinked because the same character name was used in a few. A few of the stories were good, and a few cliche, i.e., herroine that survives several murder attempts to win out in the end. If you like short stories then you'd probably like it.
159308336X|4.0|I ordered this version of P & P as I wanted a hard back to add to my few other hard back Jane A.'s novels. It arrived in a timely manner as well.  In great condition.  i was expecting the small print version like the others I had been given from Barnes and Noble and was so pleased to recieve  a book of full size, hard back, quality paper and a decent size print.  No need for glasses or squinting ---- just yet.  A lovely addition.  I'm not so thrilled about the art work, but then again I don't like any of the art work in the stories I have.  It always ruins my character in my imagination.  Happy Reading!!
B00005ATQF|5.0|I am enthralled by this masterpiece. This one and The Shining are by far the best Kubrick films. Lee Ermy is the man. He really was in the marine corps for 11 years. Every performance is brilliant. I can't say enough about this classic. This is a must have.
B000M4RG42|4.0|The men who carried out the attack on Iwo Jima are shown as young, fresh-faced recruits who play cards and pull pranks on one another as they await their assignment.  Their naivete soon turns to horror as they walk into the realties of war, shown in bloody detail in this movie.  When victory seems assured, some of the men are ordered to put up the American flag as a symbol of capturing the island.  A politician wants the original flag, so another one is put up in its place.  There is confusion, men are killed, and there is some uncertainty as to who raised the two flags.  One of the men is asked to name those who participated in the flag-raising and when he does so, they are whisked back to the US to help sell war bonds.  The war scenes are vivid and horrifying in their realty, but they are juxtaposed with a somewhat stereotypical depiction of the men returning to the US and feeling guilty about leaving their buddies behind and being honored as \\"heroes\\" while they feel that those who fell in the battle are the real heroes.  Exploitation, racism, and opportunism are all shown to be as ugly as the battle scenes themselves.  Although there are many strengths in this movie, the action switches back and forth from the battlefield to the US tour and sometimes causes confusion.  Also the viewer never gets to know most of the characters well enough to know and care about what happens to them.  This is an uneven movie, but it is intriguing nevertheless.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|Bob Dylan, the great alchemist of folk-rock music, was booed at the Newport Folk Festival, and Scorsese's 'No Direction Home' documents the hecklers yelling out \\"Traitor!\\" at many concerts.  Perhaps like any genius this is the inscrutable, but predictable development for anyone who truly innovates the wheel.  'Bringing It All Back Home' is the culprit that showcases the trajectory of when Bob, the Bard, went electric.  Arguably, this album is one of the three best of his entire career.  It is perhaps his most innovative, but his achievements have a scope that render the past two assertions needing a huge dose of salt.     Heralding the album, \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" while not as dramatic as \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" is easily as brilliant.  Complete with cutting, social commentary and plenty of images to debunk the nine-to-five existence, Dylan spills out his surreal period full throttle.  Anthems rain with the raunchy \\"Outlaw Blues\\" and the folky \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\".  Hypnotic, every song pulls a punch--or doesn't pull any punches!  The most famous mesmerizing development is \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" making Dylan a troubadour for altered consciousness*.  Despite the crossover, Dylan continued to be a great storyteller.  The first person \\"Maggie's Farm\\" showcases his familiar wit with the details of menial labor from hell.  Then, \\"On the Road Again\\" captures the same idea, but with more of a vagabond flair.  \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" meets every element at the crossroads by telling a surreal story with pointed observations.  However, some of the most delightful moments reflect upon love.  \\"She Belongs to Me\\" and \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" both exalt and debunk the romantic tradition he helped overthrow.  \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" ends the album with a brilliant story about a misfit who trashes every sensibility of romantic notions.    An unqualified achievement, 'Bringing It All Back Home' synthesizes the outlaw with the dreamer where both folk and rock, tradition and iconoclasm meet head on and make music and culture new.      (*Dylan has moved on, and hopefully so can we.)

B000GIXEIG|4.0|'Beowulf', the classic 6th century tale, in a very entertaining interpretation from a young European/Canadian film team.    PROS AND CONS    On the plus side are the film's great visuals: very authentic and interesting costumes, awe-inspiring locations, charismatic actors. The script is also quite interesting, offering an unorthodox approach on re-telling the Beowulf tale for a contemporary audience.    Unfortunately, the film doesn't unleash its full potential. It lacks pacing and temperament, feels a bit slow and unfocussed at times.   Some of the characters and plot facettes are not satisfyingly developed.     Luckily, the film makes up for its lackings in dramaturgy and storytelling through great humor and certain loftiness that perfectly captures the Viking-era zeitgeist. Beowulf and his gang of hard-boiled norse machos are just a load of fun.    The film's greatest merit, however, is that it achieves a very difficult thing: it manages to feel fresh and innovative on the one hand, and at the same time in its heart remains true to the themes of the original source material, the Beowulf epos.      BOTTOM LINE    What you should expect: a very atmospheric budget film that has its shortcomings, but is well worth seeing. Particularly recommended for anyone familiar with the Beowulf epos or an interest in the epoch.    What you should not expect: while the film is quite gory at times, it can't really be called an action movie. Don't get this DVD if you are looking for hours of over-the-top fighting and special effects.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|Whilst we do own the two 'Donner' Superman HD movies, this is one of our first more recent HD titles and I must agree with most of the other reviews here... I am not disappointed at all! <br /> <br />I love Batman as a character as he is NOT super, gamma-ray blasted, a mutant, has not had a nasty encounter with arachnids etc, he's just a guy. The only thing that makes him different from us is his wealth, that aside, he a man. A rich, revenge crazed, power dresser - now that's a place to start a character off at. <br /> <br />The story is very believable and Chris Bale covers the aspect of his tortured psyche very well. Whilst the story does intially seem to be a bit of a slow builder, it does pop along at a decent lick until the time when BATMAN in on screen non-stop for the final reel. <br /> <br />I loved the 1989 Burton version of BATMAN - it was just right for the time.  And so Chris Nolan's version is now right for our time. <br /> <br />As one of our first HD buys, this really knocked us out of our chair! It was awsome.  Before this, we had a multi-region capable upscaling DVD and that made our R1 standard DVD look really great - I couldn't see it being bettered by much...turns out that I was wrong. <br /> <br />There may be better out there, but I really do like this one and I recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br />Roll on the BATMAN RETURNS sequel.

B00026YO36|5.0|I've been slightly conflicted by Mark Lanegan's solo career.  On the one hand, the highpoints are not quite as high as the highpoints of his work with the Screaming Trees.  On the other hand, each album as a whole tends to be better than the Screaming Trees's albums as wholes.  It isn't an accident that the two best Screaming Tree albums were anthologies.  But I've been struck by how very good his solo projects are from first to last.  This at least is true of SCRAPS OF MIDNIGHT, I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU, and his solo masterpiece, WHISKEY FOR THE HOLY GHOST.<br /><br />The songs on the album are consistently dark and melancholy.  Many are exceptional and there is a wonderful blend of hard driving rockers and softer, more introspective numbers.  There are also some significant guess appearances.  Lanegan was briefly in the band Queens of the Stone Age and former band mates Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri.  And one of my rock idols, Polly Jean Harvey, helps out on a couple of cuts, including what may be the best track on the disc, \\"I Hit the City,\\" the raucous second track on the album.  Izzy Stradlin appears on another cut.  Other highlights include the noisy but compelling \\"Methamphetamine Blues,\\" the more up tempo \\"Sideways in Reverse,\\" and hard rocking \\"Driving Death Valley Blues.\\"  There are also some great lo-fi moments.  \\"Strange Religion\\" is almost languorous, as is \\"Morning Glory Wine, which sounds an awful lot like a Tom Waits song, and \\"When Your Number is Up\\" which starts the album off.<br /><br />Over the past twenty years Lanegan has built up an impressive catalog of first rate material.  Anyone collecting his albums should put this on a short list of must-haves.  Last year saw him backing Isobel Campbell (those not directly familiar with her work may know her as the main female vocalist for Belle and Sebastian) as one of the best albums of 2006.  Hopefully 2007 will see him releasing a new album of his own compositions.
B000JU7NCE|5.0|Throw away the synthesizers and crank up the amps.  That's what Robert Smith and The Cure chose to do in the Summer of 2005.  The result:  a sound I like to refer to as 'rock'.  No synth-pop or new wave dance stuff here. Robert Smith has always nodded to Jimmi Hendrix from time to time and in this compilation of festival appearances shows off Smith's guitar chops like no other live DVD available.  The guy can play guitar. <br /> <br />Snooty video-philes and industry experts will tell you how horrible the editing job is and how terrible the video effects in this compilation turn out.  I don't get it.  After reading some of these reviews I expected some tortured, terrible creation that was barely watchable.  Quite the contrary.  The myth of its poor quality is just that - hardly relying on much of the 'amateur' footage from cell phones and what-not, the filming and effects capture the mood of each song nicely.  If you have a Phd in film studies, you will not agree since you know oh so much better than the rest of us philistines. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you like The Cure, the price is nice and there is absolutely no reason you do not want this item.  I'm glad I ignored the naysayers.  You will be too.
0812550706|4.0|Ender is the third child in a futuristic world where parents are only allowed to have two children.  Ender is an exception; the government asked his parents to have him because they thought he would have the genetic makeup to be an ideal soldier.  The government desperately needs good soldiers; they are worried about further attacks from an alien species that has already attacked Earth twice.  When Ender is six years old, the government decides that he does have the stuff in him to make him a great soldier, and so they take him from his family and put him into a children's military academy where he will begin training to be all he can be. <br /> <br />This story follows Ender from the time he is six until he is ten, and we see his growth from a scared little boy into a powerful military leader.  Ender is brilliant, and the purpose of the school is to mold him into a general.  Ender has to make the decision whether he will allow himself to be molded, though, and he needs to decide what kind of person he would like to be. <br /> <br />I liked Ender as a character.  I thought he was sympathetic and interesting, and I enjoyed reading about him thwarting all attempts to beat him down.  I also liked how the other characters interacted with each other, and I thought the war games were vivid and detailed. <br /> <br />There were parts of this book that were less believable than others, and I didn't particularly like the subplot of Ender's siblings.  I thought the book would be better if it just focused on the activities inside the school.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I was really bummed after listening to this CD a few times.   <br />I have been a HUGE fan of Norah's from the first time that I heard her voice.  I still love listening to COME AWAY WITH ME, and FEELS LIKE HOME.  These are 2 of the very few albums that I can just sit down and listen to all the way through--they have always moved me and I have found so many of the tracks on these past albums so musically powerful. <br />But, as I said, I have found this new one to be a slight disappointment.  The lyrics lack any complexity whatsoever, several of the songs are actually redundant, and I find it to be pretty much uninspiring all around.   <br />I have always defended Norah in the past when my friends and family have labeled her as \\"background music--\\" but I'm afraid that I would definitely (although reluctantly) put this album into that category...

B000H0MKOC|5.0|I loved this film. I thought it was one of the finest comedic films in a long time. Too bad, it was released to early in the year to get the Oscar momentum. Aaron Eckhart should have earned a Best Actor nomination easily. I saw this film on an airplane to or from London. I thought it was one of the best films around. It was smart, witty, and spoke volumes about the hypocrisy of the anti-smoking attitudes.<br /><br />No, I'm not a smoker but I'm not a zealot neither. I don't need Atlantic City to become smoke free. It would lose it's appeal as the only place in New Jersey where smoking is not only tolerated but allowed. Have we become a society where smoking is villified as public enemy number? Smoking is a choice. We know all the dangers about it from the cigarette pack labels and how smoking kills you.<br /><br />Yes, smoking can lead to lung cancer, emphysema, and heart problems but so can stress, anxiety, and unhealthy eating habits. The health food gestapo is already on our case about that we drink and eat poorly. Yes, I know soda is not good for me healthwise but I can't change my habits after a lifetime. I know that eating chocolate, cheese, and junk food is unhealthy but it's still my choice.<br /><br />Smokers have the right to choose to stop smoking or continue. The smokers who blame their addictions on the smoking industry are looking for compensation for their addiction when it was themselves who placed the cigarette in their mouths without force. Smoking is not healthy and probably caused my father to die sooner than he should but I don't blame the tobacco industry for our country's ills.<br /><br />You are far more dangerous to get killed by somebody talking on his/cell phone while driving. Smoking is used by most smokers to alleave the stress and anxiety in their lives. If you can cure stress and anxiety for all of us, we wouldn't need smoking or any other vice like caffeine to stop us. Until then, let smokers be who and what they are. Did it ever occur to anybody that maybe smokers don't want to live that long anyway? No, they just assume that we want to live to be a 100 and for what, so somebody can announce your birthday on the Today show.
B0001MDQ6W|5.0|This DVD is made by MTV, and it's got weird lighting, that's of course, really cool. The songs are good, & Bob was young-ish, so buy it for sure, or you'll never own a Bob Dylan DVD. (He signed each disc himself (not really.)). It's all acoustic, even the upright bass player. He uses no elctric guitars, but it's still really good.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements are simple to understand and are an easy way to begin a transformation in your life. If you want to live happier and have had it up to \\"here\\" with the ideas and beliefs that others push on you, you will really enjoy this book. <br /> <br />During the course of explaining the Four Agreements, the author gives a rather grounded explanation of consciousness and experience. It is metaphorical in its prose but sparks thought and gives an understanding of habitual actions and thoughts. <br /> <br />The book is not religious in nature at all, and the author states this intent early in the book. Another reviewer said the book is \\"New Age\\" but don't be fooled by that reviewer, the book is not \\"New Age.\\" It is also not \\"worldly\\" or \\"secular\\" or any of those kitchy sunday school buzzwords. <br /> <br />Have an open heart and mind when you read the book, it can work wonders for you.

B0007TKNKG|3.0|Rifftrax [...] announced that on 2/19/2007 they will release the \\"Mystery science theater 3000-esque\\" commentary track for this \\"classic\\".       I dont want to sound TOO much like a commercial for them, but this movie is bad in a good, cheesy way and the Rifftrax commentaries are perfect to play along while you are watching this film.     I remember watching this movie at the theater when it came out and groaning during the movie.   I cannot to watch it again with the humorous commentary.

0060005696|1.0|In the late 1990s Professor Schwartz went to buy a pair of blue jeans and was traumatized by the array of choices that confronted him.  Most guys who don't like shopping would have just ordered a pair of jeans from a mail order catalog.  But Mr. Schwartz became obsessed with counting things like the number of varieties of crackers (85) at his local supermarket or computer printers (27) at an electronics store.  That counting ritual led him to a \\"belief\\" that too much choice causes societal anxiety and unhappiness.    Mr. Schwartz further trivializes his topic by making no distinction between anxiety induced by having to make decisions about cancer treatments or spiritual and moral matters and the supposed (self-induced?) trauma of having to choose between blue jeans styles cracker brands.  And he also confuses materialism and habitual recreational shopping with the supposed disadvantages of \\"choice\\".  To understand this book it helps to know that Mr. Schwarz hates free market economies enough to co-author a book subtitled \\"How market freedom erodes the best things in life\\".    In an effort to pretend there might be some relevant objective evidence to back up the author's political views Schwartz cites some research about people called \\"maximizers\\" who are said to obsessed with seeking the \\"best\\" of everything instead of \\"satificers\\" (yes, this book actually uses these dumb academic words) who settle for \\"good enough\\". Then he tells us that people who are maximizers share some traits with people who are unhappy. Schwartz acknowledges (page 86) there is no evidence to support the notion that being a maximizer causes depression (i.e., unhappiness) but says \\"Nonetheless, I believe that being a maximizer does play a causal role in people's unhappiness and I believe that learning how to satisfice (sic) is an important step not only in coping with a world of choice but in simply enjoying life.\\"  There was a time when academics contributed to the public good by conducting actual research to provide evidence that supported their conclusions and opinions. But in response to specific questions about the so-called \\"maximizers\\" who Schwartz bases his entire book on - \\"What percentage of the population are maximizers?\\" and \\"What makes people maximizers?\\" - Schwarz responds, respectively, \\"I can't answer that\\" and \\"We don't know.\\"  This is research?    Schwartz spends the remainder of the book explaining how his \\"beliefs\\" prove that free market choices cause mental illness and then provides \\"strategies... for fighting back against the tyranny of overwhelming choices\\" (page 79).  So what are some of the helpful strategies for dealing with the free market choice-induced unhappiness Schwartz \\"believes\\" is occurring? \\"Choose when to choose\\" (i.e., don't spend as much time sorting through boxes of crackers as you would in evaluating a new car); \\"Make your decisions nonreversible\\" (i.e., paint yourself into a corner and never undo a mistake...); \\"Control expectations\\" (i.e., don't hope for too much because you might be disappointed...); \\"Curtail social comparisons\\" (i.e., don't compare yourself to other people because it will just make you unhappy); \\"Learn to love constraints\\" (i.e., it's futile to struggle for a better life in a world stacked against you so don't try).    Buy this book if you don't already have enough \\"tyranny\\" in your life to worry about. Otherwise, ignore it and go about your daily activities blissfully ignorant of Barry Schwartz' \\"belief\\" in choice-induced anxiety.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Nice packaging.  Love the series.  Additional special features on the DVD are nice.  Well worth purchasing if you are a fan of the show.
0440238609|5.0|If you enjoy Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings you will love this. <br />Very complex story with a lot of characters with their own agendas. <br />It takes place in many worlds with intertwined sub-plots. Stay with the first book for at least one hundred pages. It's a strange world at first  <br />but around ninety pages it starts to come together. <br />There's a movie coming out in the winter of 2007. Looking forward to <br />seeing it. It's gonna be big and no doubt there will be controversy  <br />surrounding it because of the religious themes within the plot.
B0007M22TI|5.0|One of the most enjoyable DVD's I have purchased. The ladies are truly gifted.
B000002H92|4.0|Great 2 disc set for the money as it is Absolutely Live on disc1 and abridged versions of Alive She Cried and Live at the Hollywood Bowl on disc2; I only minus it a star because I'm not real crazy about the Hollywood Bowl material. <br /> <br />So anyways, the whole first disc is awesome; really stand out guitar that is up in the mix and you get The Celebration of the Lizard tracks. The second disc has a definitive version of Roadhouse Blues and a really great version  of Light My Fire.

1573225517|5.0|\\"High Fidelity\\" is a near-perfect novel.  Not only is it almost too entertaining for its own good, it also is brilliantly written by Hornby and it provides and excellent look into the world of relationships.  Rob is a failing record store owner who recently broke up with his girlfriend and needs to go back and re-examine his life to realize where he needs to be is where he was all along.  Mix in some of the greatest music lists ever assembled and you have a great novel.  Hornby rarely lets people down and along with \\"Songbook,\\" this could be his most enjoyable work.
0800141660|5.0|I love this movie.  The acting is great, and it's got a great balance of Jane Austen's mild sense of humor and romance.  I have not read the book, but the style of this movie seems true to the style of the other books I have read by her.
B0001XAS1M|5.0|Yes, I am using the word masterpiece in reference to a Meatloaf album; and I am not ashamed!  Jim Steinman 'the writer of BOOH,' is one of the most overlooked songwriters/arrangers in rock and roll.  Todd Rundgren, rock genius/producer/arranger/guitarist on the album, was the only person who agreed to produce the album and that was after a year of rejections for Meat and Steinman.  Rundgren arranged all the background vocals as well and they sound just as good as they do on all his solo albums.   <br /> <br />The title track is one of the best openers in history and is a Bruce Springsteen esque heavy metal track with the ultimate motor cycle lyrics and the infamous motorcycle guitar 'played by Rundgren in one take.'  \\"Paradise by the Dashboard Lights\\" could be one of the catchiest songs ever written and would fit better in an Andrew Loyd Weber opera than on a 1970's rock album 'but that is the fun of the album.'  \\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\\" is the best ballad on the album and in the words of many would \\"forever change the love song.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, Meat Loaf has produced a lot of less-than-stellar albums in the 30 years since Bat I came out; however, this cd is truly essential listening for anyone who is a music fan and is not too proud to listen to Meat Loaf.

1573229725|5.0|I could not put this book down. And aside from the last Harry Potter book (book #6) this is one of the few books I've read so exhaustively fast that friends and family were a little peeved at my putting them off until I finished.<br /><br />Needless to say--the page-turning talents of Ms Waters are tremendous.<br /><br />She wraps you into Victorian England in a way that is part of the story and of our protagonists lives rather than being overly descriptive to show off historical research for it's own sake. Just the same, if you're a fan of Victorian anything (esp. hypocrisy), you'll love the way she immerses you in it.<br /><br />The story of our two main protagonists, who's fates seem almost completely controlled by others (except of course, for their love of each other) is set among a thick plot of thievery, debauchery, gentlemen society, London squalor and a lunatic asylum (all key victorian themes). The pace is quite fast through all three parts of the book, though I did think it got a little tired in the asylum chapters. however the book regrouped & I loved how it finished.<br /><br />I've just found that a BBC series was adapted from the book and can't wait to see it on DVD.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

0812975219|5.0|This is not an investment manual, it's just an interesting book about how much randomness impacts our lives and our (often inaccurate) attempts to cope with it.  <br /> <br />I'm not a trader or a mathematician, just someone who enjoys reading about interesting, intellectually stimulating ideas, and this book delivers that with compelling anecdotes, much as, say, \\"The Wisdom of Crowds\\" or \\"The Tipping Point\\" does.  <br /> <br />If you come for some thoughtful, fun and mostly insightful stories from a layperson's perspective, as I did, you will probably enjoy the book.  <br /> <br />If you come looking for an investment manual, a serious mathematical discourse on randomness or an economics text, you probably will not.
B0002234LS|3.0|A good DVD. Johnny Depp gives one of his better performances in this creepy little movie. The story is vintage Stephen King and bears some similarities to The Shining. The bonuses included four deleted scenes which were interesting to see, but I don't think anybody really misses them from the movie. The best bonus in my opinion was the animated storyboards of the opening credits and the garden. A nicely made movie.

B000M4RG42|4.0|To give a less than shining review of Clint Eastwood's FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is tantamount to being labeled un-American. That is sad because for this viewer the result of the film is not whether or not Eastwood's nonlinear development of a story that bumps and spurts and reflects and meanders and shadows reality lets us get to know the 'heroes' cast in the roles of the three men who survived a single incident in the atrocity of WW II: this is a film that hopefully will be ultimately seen as one of the strongest antiwar statements made to date.<br /><br />Eastwood does not preach to us, but he rather pulls the curtain back to see the staggering atrocities committed by both camps of soldiers on Iwo Jima - a mirror for every other battle that tore the world apart during WW II - while showing the true venom of the politicians and high mucky mucks back home, those rather insensitive men who elected to create mannequins out of the three men who just happened to be photographed in one of the most infamous photographs of the war and made them sell war bonds, cashing in on emotions to get the big bucks needed to keep the war machine well oiled. That aspect is the more terrifying. As the writers place the words in the mouth of James Bradley: 'Heroes are something we create, something we need. It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible, how people could sacrifice so much for us, but for my dad and these men the risks they took, the wounds they suffered, they did that for their buddies, they may have fought for there country but they died for there friends. For the man in front for the man beside him, and if we wish to truly honor these men we should remember them the way they really were the way my dad remembered them'.<br /><br />The cast is very good: Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, Adam Beach, Barry Pepper, Jaime Bell, Paul Walker, Joseph Cross as the young men and bit parts of the older men played by such luminaries as George Grizzard, Harve Presnell, George Hearn and Len Cariou. The battle photography is staggering and gruesome. No, we never really get to know the true personalities of the boys named as heroes, but having been through a war this viewer can mention that backgrounds and character studies somehow dissolve when young men are thrown into the horror of survival. They were all heroes, whether they survived or not. Eastwood is asking us to look at the heinous futility of war and the depersonalization war causes - except in the tortured memories of those who come home.

0060191325|2.0|This is a different type book than what I normally read.  \\"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\\" by John Gray is an attempt to help couples communicate.  The premise is that men and women are so different it is as if they are from different planets.  The book is full of examples of behaviors and the motivations behind those behaviors, which Dr. Gray assigns to one sex or the other.    As indicated by the two-star rating I gave this book, I have several problems with it, but it is not totally without use so I want to cover that part as well.  Starting with the problems I will begin with the writing style.  The Mars/Venus theme gets old very quick, and while he eventually seems to get away from it later in the book, he should have minimized it much more quickly.  The analogy is fine, but it doesn't need to be repeated ad nauseam.  The problem with being repetitive doesn't end with the theme either, as he feels the need to repeat his points over and over.  This makes for a longer book, but it does wear on the reader.    The content of the book is not without issues either.  Much of what he talks about are stereotypes and over-simplifications.  Furthermore, the behaviors he assigns to one sex or the other can easily be seen in both.  While he does indicate that you should not be surprised if your particular behaviors are more like the ones he assigns to the other sex, he definitely implies that people follow one type of behavior or the other.  I found as I was reading through the examples that I could relate to either set of behaviors (not just one), and thought of examples in my life which fit both.    At some point the book stops being balanced between the two sexes and seems to be more aimed at the female audience.  The chapter called \\"How to Ask for Support and Get It\\" would probably be more aptly titled \\"How to Manipulate Men and Get What You Want\\".  While he specifically indicates that particular chapter is for women, some of the other later chapters also seemto be skewed.    As promised, there is something of value to be gained from reading this book, and that is that it may well help you understand your partner's moods and thinking patters based on how you are seeing them act.  The basic premise of the entire book is to help people communicate, and I do believe that this book can help one to see things from the perspective of their spouse or love, and that can definitely help couples communicate.  So ignore the `one sex behaves this way and the other behaves that way' stuff, and concentrate on the behaviors and motivations behind them and you can get something out of it.  Also, it is a good idea to skip to the next section when you find a particular part has become too repetitive.
0385491026|4.0|I enjoyed this novel.  It's a \\"good read.\\"  Reading about \\"mean girls\\" that hover around young girls rang true.  I remember my two best friends deciding to ignore me one day on a field trip for no apparent reason.  They wouldn't talk or seat next to me.  Elaine's experiences are much more severe but her state of mind at the time seemed familiar. <br /> <br />Don't expect the great North American novel, but do expect a really personal glimpse into the main character's formative life.

B000FVQM2Y|2.0|Okay. This film has a nonchalant style of its own, it has a pretty good plot setting start and from then on, I was utterly bamboozled and I don't even use the word. I didn't understand the storyline. I didnt quite get the plot. The characters seemed dazed to me, they made me feel dazed too. The acting was a bit too inward. The villains look irritatingly queer. What is brick,anyway? The best thing about this confusing ride was the end. The fact that it had one. Not since Lady in the water, have I seen something so confusing.

0140430725|3.0|I enjoyed \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen a great deal more than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\".<br /><br />Elizabeth's sense of humor made her a much more interesting heroine in my opinion. She and her father seemed to enjoy a love for the absurd, although her mother's behavior did embarrass her. Other than that there are many parallels among the characters in the story: Elizabeth and Elinor, Lydia and Marianne, Jane and Mrs. Dashwood, Wickham and Willoughby.<br /><br />It still bothers me that all the women think about is finding a husband, that an \\"accomplished\\" woman \\"sang and played all day\\", but I have to assume that was the world Jane herself was exposed to at the time.<br /><br />You know that with a family that size and all those dinner parties, there had to be some people working very hard in that household, but they are barely ever mentioned and then only in brief passing and only in their concern for the family.<br /><br />Fifty years after these novels were published, we see books such as \\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott depicting an American family. In this book the characters are much less one sided. Although some of the girls were still thinking primarily of finding husbands, they had to pitch in and help make the world around them.<br /><br />Another fifty years later, \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" by L. M. Montgomery describes a young Canadian woman from a very different set of circumstances who puts the romantic side of life into perspective.<br /><br />Both Jo and Anne are charcters that I would encourage young girls to meet early in life. The Austen women in the books I've read so far, although they may be a study of women from a certain subsection of society in England at the time the novels are written, are not ones I'd place before my daughters.

If you seen and liked The Blues Brothers starring Dan Aykroyd, you'll like this film co-starring Dan aykroid. And did forget to say that Bill Murry is in it too! See this film before it's too late! YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM!!! Also see the film Ghostbusters 2.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers deserve many Grammys for this new body of work.  The two CDS are filled with transporting music and incredible lyrics.  The lyrics offer hours of enjoyment each line fresh with new ideas and imagery.  I love to listen to them while I'm painting in my studio.  I actually loose weight while I work because I'm jumping around like Flea in between strokes.  Kudos to the RHCP!!!
B00005JL0I|5.0|This is the original version of this film with David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen and other very familiar faces.  The film is nothing at all like the 2006 version which was very good.  But Ian Fleming intended his 007 to be a non-serious serious agent.  Excellent film and I heartily recommend it.  My 20-something grandson is a 007 fan and he really liked this movie; had to have the DVD after seeing it on TV.
0195073401|5.0|This book is a real heavy-weight book, in its content and in its size of over 1000 pages. It provides most foundations you need in microeconomics. Finish this book and find applications of your interests elsewhere: it does not contain many applications of microeconomics as it is not intended to be an book of applications. (Mild warning: after you read this book, most likely, you will see microeconomics differently.) It is not an easy book, but the payoff is massive.     PS. For those who mention that this book lacks economics policy implications, I think to be fair, this book is not meant to be a policy oriented book--it just builds the necessary foundations, then you find policy oriented books elsewhere.
B000068OCS|5.0|Call it a statement. An analysis. Fine Art. A masterful fusion of visual and auditory art, i.e. Philip Glass at his best.  Koyaanisqatsi shows us the ills of our modern world in a new light. It contrasts the beauty and grandeur of our natural world with its destruction.  Despite the date of production, the film is applicable to the state of humanity today.  <br />   It is an artist's, a monk's view of our hustling-bustling lives. A fresh world view is presented as if seen through the eyes of first century monk transported in time to the current era. It speaks to you at a deep subconscious level. This film leaves you with new desires, a reason to help make changes, and an urge for a more peaceful life. Koyaanisqatsi is unforgettable. <br />
B000LE1FAY|5.0|Cool, sophisticated, different.  She purrs, she showcases that signature, complex voice, all at once heartbroken, confident, sexy...she speaks a language I don't understand, but her voice is so well suited to this style of music, I do understand.  Tracks are all over the map...the flamenco guitar on Jezebel, cool disco beat of La Vie en Rose (Belinda to a disco beat? Perfection...no one thought of this sooner??), great classic ballads complete with classic french accordion, the avant guarde styled Bonnie et Clyde.  A pleasant surprise from start to finish.  I predict Americans will be too stupid to get this one, which is too bad.  She deserves major kudos for this.  Love it.

B00007GZQI|5.0|I saw this movie in the late '60's when it was made. I liked it then. I had not seen it since, but have been contemplating attitudes toward money lately and remembered the movie. It is interesting how 36 years (or so) can change one's perspective. Although the movie did not change (obviously), my attitude toward money has changed. I still have a certain amount of disrespect for money and for selling the days of my life for money. I still believe that people are much more greedy than they need to be. All of these things stayed the same, both in the movie (of course) and in my mind. I now have enough money to meet my basic needs and even a few \\"wants\\" that are not needs. When I first saw the movie, I was on the outside, not always knowing if I would have enough to secure basic needs. Either way, this movie is a biting satire and can allow one to step far enough from the current attitudes toward money that one might have and start to explore them from a different perspective.<br /><br />Even if the viewer does not want to have that deep of an experience while watching a movie, it is interesting to see how many well known people, both living and (now) dead are in one movie; sometimes just walking through in the background, sometimes with important parts.<br /><br />This movie is part of the culture and should not be missed.

1878424319|4.0|In \\"The Four Agreements:  A Practical Guide to Freedom,\\" author Don Miguel Ruiz offers us four cardinal principles for living a fulfilling, peaceful and happy life.  The four principles are:   <br /> <br />Be impeccable with your word. <br />Don't take anything personally. <br />Don't make assumptions. <br />Always do your best. <br /> <br />Ruiz calls these principles \\"agreements,\\" reflecting the Toltec view that we cause our own suffering by agreeing to self-limiting beliefs.  This process begins at childhood, when parents and teachers instruct us how to behave and what to think.  Through this process we create boundaries for acceptable thought and behavior; we also learn how to judge--judging ourselves, judging others, and creating separation and hurt.  By embracing the four agreements, we can reverse the process; we can experience lives that are authentic, rewarding, and painless. <br /> <br />Ruiz attributes his philosophy to the Toltec tradition, but many readers will find parallels with \\"A Course in Miracles\\" and other non-religious self-help books that teach the path to enlightenment usually involves shedding our own misconceptions and overcoming our tendency to force others to conform to our own expectations. <br /> <br />At times the language Ruiz uses is stilted; it seems as though he is intentionally trying to sound like a mystic or elder.  Fortunately, the book is short, and the advice timeless.  \\"The Four Agreements\\" will help you to transform--and improve--your life. <br />

B000M4RG42|2.0|the historical inaccuracies in this movie are ludicrous. we were not going broke fighting ww2. our navy and marine commanders were by and large thoughtful and caring men. the treasury department people in charge of the war bonds were nothing like those portrayed in the movie. the battle scenes shown are designed to horrify, not truly tell the story of what happened on iwo jima. there were a lot of heroes at iwo jima, not all dead on the field of battle. this movie seems to have been written by someone who wants to strip all nobility from warriors, and to denigrate any american authority figure from that time period. a lot of time and care went into this movie, unfortunately, in the service of anti-american propaganda. what in the world has happened to clint?
B000J103YI|4.0|I purchased this CD for the headliner, Jennifer Hudson and her rendition of \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\".  Honey, this is the crust topping of a creame brulee!

0743454537|5.0|I have read a few reviews and decided I needed to write my own.  I thoroughly enjoyed the different presentation of this book.  It wasn't difficult at all for me to keep up with each character as it switched back and forth.  The ending totally surprised me, but it wasn't what I expected.  I've heard other readers criticize the ending.  Why?  That's the way the story was written.  In real life, we moan and groan how things turn out, but there's nothing we can do to change them.  This was the first time I read any of Jodi Picoult's work, and if her other books are as well written, I will read more.

B000F1IQNM|5.0|Just like a fairy tale in that you have this funny story that has some very valuable truths to it. The kids will enjoy the humor -it really is a cute movie. The adults, some/most (hopefully) will get the larger message here.<br /><br />Cedric Brown is a recently widowed father of 7 children. He received financial help from a wealthy aunt who has given him the ultimatum to find a suitable wife and mother for the children within a month or her finacial backing will dissappear. The children are out of control and drive away numerous nannies until Nanny McPhee shows up and gets the unruly children to comply to her wishes. (lessons)<br /><br />The children try to drive Nanny McPhee away and she tells them that they should know something about the way she works: \\"When you need me, but do not want me, I must stay. When you want me and no longer need me, then I must go.\\"  -This reminds me of something I've read about anger/hatred -that when you hate something/someone it will stay, only after you can love it will it go. (be released) So, this makes me think that many \\"lessons\\" come in a form that we do not like until -as in the movie- the lesson is learned and then there is love and release. Each time the children 'learn'(complete) a lesson, Nanny McPhee magically loses one of her 'ugly' markings. Hence the saying -\\"We see things not as they are but as WE are.\\" Also, I liked the part where Evangeline is reading a story and is trying to figure it out, and as it turns out, the story is really about her.<br /><br />I think it's a great movie! Me and the kids enjoy it! The ending is beautiful!

B00065MDSQ|2.0|I had heard that \\"Red\\" was on par with \\"Permanent Waves\\" by Rush; in fact, the person who wrote that said that \\"Red\\" was the rightful precursor to \\"Permanent Waves\\" and that others should recognize it as such. Well I beg to differ! I bought \\"Red\\" with the idea that I was about to hear what Rush had, as was implied previously, \\"stolen\\" from King Crimson. When I heard the tracks, a meager 39 minutes total, I was thorougly unimpressed. Here's my assessment:  <br /> \\"Red\\" has five songs, one of which (\\"Providence\\") is nothing more than a sloppy eight-minute improvised monster of meanderings which does not even come CLOSE to resembling jazz or any other music form. There was nothing about this \\"song\\" which appealed to me, both as a prog music fan and as a bass player of 25+ years experience. Philip Glass is purported to be a fan of KC, and writes very long pieces of music...but at least HE keeps his listener interested throughout! Rush has written several mega-minute songs (\\"Hemispheres,\\" \\"The Camera Eye,\\" \\"Natural Science\\" etc) which were designed to tell a story, challenged the listener's imagination, kept the listener interested musically, and left them so satisfied that they wanted more (unfortunately for older Rush fans, this formula was abandoned by Rush after \\"Moving Pictures\\").  <br />   \\"Red,\\" the instrumental title track, was the only song which didn't make me cringe. It reminded me of some of Yes's early experimental work, notwithstanding Bill Bruford's work on the piece. The production work was very good, considering the time it was recorded (although this could have been enhanced by its re-production (I bought the 30th anniversary edition)). However, this was the only song I liked on the album.  <br />   In summary, as a long-time Rush fan, and former professional musician, I have to say that King Crimson's \\"Red\\" is NOT anywhere on par with Rush's \\"Permanent Waves\\" album no matter how you evaluate it. Rush's songs were more pleasing to the ear, easier torecall (obviously by the record sales and airplay of \\"Spirit of Radio\\"), more technically accurate and intricate, tight and \\"clean.\\" The first words that came to my mind when I heard \\"Red\\" were \\"disorganized\\" and \\"sloppy.\\" I know that I'm offending some fans here; I don't mean to do that intrinsically. My only goal is to refute the comparison between these two albums, and to put my two cents worth of opinion into the debate.  <br />   I will concede that King Crimson preceded Rush (ironically, \\"Red\\" came out the year that Rush offically joined together in 1974). However, I maintain that Getty Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart are far better musicans and songwriters. This is not my opinion exclusively: Rush's record sales are reported to be in the top 10 of ALL rock bands's of all time! To compare \\"Permanent Waves\\" to \\"Red\\" (or any other album for that matter!!!) is arbitrary at best. It's really a matter of taste and asthetic choice.
0790733226|5.0|This is science fiction, and should be watched as such. Many of the premises are credible, and many are incredible. I'm not sure that I would call 26 light-years as deep space (26 thousand ly would be), that would be our close neighbor, but it makes the possibility of a message being received and resent in 52 years. The first time I watched it, I was not thrilled, maybe since it seem too far-fetched. I recently saw it again and was able to enjoy as straight science fiction. I was not sure what to make of the relationship between the preacher (Matt), and Jodie Foster. I think he was added to buffer religious sentiments.

0684865130|4.0|I laughed outloud a lot while reading this book, but towards the last 1/4 of the book it began to drag a little, and I felt that it could have ended sooner and still been good.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|1985's The Breakfast Club stars Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, and Anthony Michael Hall. They play five high school students who have to give up half of their weekend to spend a Saturday detention at their school. The characters have nothing in common and obviously don't know each other when they get together for the detention, but they surely get to know each other quite a bit. Paul Gleason (who passed away last year, played Mr. Vernon, the principal) is great as well. When Mr. Vernon leaves the room, you can just imagine what goes on amongst the five students during their detention. I first saw this movie years ago on the Encore channel back in the 90s, and thought it was so cool and funny as well. The soundtrack to the film is excellent too, including the Simple Minds song Don't You (Forget About Me). The sound and picture quality are excellent too. However, there are no extras on this DVD, such as interviews with the actors, director, or behind the scenes footage. That is kind of a bummer, but the movie is still worth watching anyway. Get this movie and have a few laughs; you won't be disappointed.
6305511055|5.0|This has been a favorite movie of mine for years.  This 1975 flick was right in keeping with the cold-war spy stuff that so permeated the lives of people at that time. I remember all the spy TV shows and spy movies. Heck, I even remember as a kid going down to the basement when the warning sirens went off (East Coast).  I think that was the 1950s. In the 70s, spies were heroes and covert activities were going on everywhere. I wanted to work for the CIA, too, just like in the movies. (I do work for the government, but not CIA.)<br /><br />Anyway, as you've probably read already, Redford is in his prime and is a spy (Joe Turner) working for the CIA.  He just reads books and analyzes them.  He looks for things that are out-of-place in the writings, which may point to a covert operation taking place somewhere in the world.  If he finds something, he writes a report and (as typical within the government) sends the report forward up the chain-of-command.<br /><br />Well, guess what?  He submits a report on something wierd he finds in the books, goes out to pick up lunch, and returns to find everybody in the library office whacked. This was a somewhat secure location, too. Necessity is the mother of invention, and since Joe Turner feels the need to stay alive, he calls in to Headquarters and goes on the run. As he starts running, he begins to realize that people are after him too.  He can no longer be sure who to trust. Joe's cover name is Condor, which he never thought he would use, and Condor becomes a cloak-and-dagger guy, on the run. He enlists the help of Kathy (Faye Dunaway), just someone he picked at random and sensed was harmless. The head bad guy cold-blooded-killer is Max von Sydow (Jobert), and he is outstanding, as always. Jobert really doesn't particularly care who he kills; it's just business. But somehow, you kind of like Jobert. Cliff Robertson works for the CIA as Wiggins and Condor is talking back and forth with Wiggins to try to get to safety somehow. Condor is running from Jobert (and others), hiding and running with Kathy, and trying to work something out with Wiggins.<br /><br />Well, remember that book report Condor wrote that we talked about in the beginning? Turns out there is something going on.  That's why all those people got whacked! (Duh). What's going on has a bunch of people involved, so there are twists and turns and surprises, and there is running and hiding and being clever all over the place.  Condor turns out to be quite clever because \\"he reads books\\" all the time. Well, knowledge is power.<br /><br />Great spy story. I have to read the book one day because as good as the movie was, I'm sure the book is even better. Great acting by everyone. 117 minutes long..

But then: this is the music they played in the 70's - it's entirely without computing, and therefore as real as the hum of beas!<br /><br />Stevie is impressively inspired, at his most sensual.

B00005JM20|4.0|When I was in the mood for a spy spoof to watch with a certain James Bond film, I decided to give the Austin Powers films a miss, and sample Johnny English (other hopefuls would be Spy Hard, but my recollection of that film is that I wanted to walk out of the theatre--and then there's Spies Like Us, but, uh, no, not right now).    Johnny English stars George Lazenby--oh no wait, that's Rowan Atkinson--and an Australian with very little acting experience, George Lazenby--oh no wait that's Natalie Imruglia.  It is Atkinson, as the title character, who helps make this a delightful surprise, along with some pretty funny sequences:   for instance, Atkinson having trouble with his tie in a sushi bar, Atkinson involved in a car chase where the car he's in is hanging from the winch of a tow truck.    The knocks against this film, when they come, seem to be as follows: we've had too many spy spoofs, the plot involving John Malkovich as a Frenchman trying to become ruler of England is too ridiculous, and the film isn't that funny.  To all this frippery I say:   how many, exactly, is too many spy spoofs?, this is a comedy and the outrageous, shamefacedly contrived storyline is so brash and amorphous that it's a daring nonsensical joy, and finally, though not all the gags work perfectly, I found I was laughing most of the way through.    Uh, not to put too fine a point on it, but who is saying we have too many spy spoofs...fans of the TWENTY-ONE Bond films?    More thoughts on the gags:  sure, Atkinson's intrusion on a funeral and its results goes on a bit long, and a buttocks-shot joke harks right back to Naked Gun 2(and a half), and the drawn-out results of our bumbling hero's parachute jump onto a skyscraper are only mildly amusing, but there are many more tidbits that I don't want to spoil.  It's not true at all that this film is only funny the first time round; if You Only Watch Once, then you deny yourself repeated exposure to Malkovich's bad French accent, and the guy with the eyepatch, the banana-shaped scars, the bad teeth, and the frizzy orange hair.      I think that Johnny English is pretty consistent in doling out the laughs, and that makes it a success as far as I'm concerned.  We probably won't see a sequel, so those who feel we have too many spy spoofs shall have their petty little victory, I suppose.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|... because it is difficult to pick a starting point. <br /> <br />I think my DVD is nearly worn out already- and I have only had it for a few days... <br /> <br />I was originally utterly blown away by the original Celtic Woman DVD, so when \\"A New Journey\\" was announced, I was almost beside myself. Not just at the thought of more from the 5 girls, but the fact Hayley Westenra was to join them. Now, being a Kiwi, I am unashamedly biased when it comes to Hayley. That lass is pure golden syrup for your ears! So her inclusion in this new production is so much more than just an added bonus for me. Dare I say it, but her vocal prowess almost upstages the other 4 vocalists... <br /> <br />The next delight was to see Máiréad Nesbitt getting considerably more stage time. It would be criminal to give her any less of a presence in anything she is involved with. Her performance here would have to be her best on DVD so far- and I have been an avid fan since I first saw her in Lord of the Dance. She is just fantastic. As an earlier reviewer commented, it is almost worth buying the DVD for her performance alone: dancing, twirling, spinning, duelling with bodhrans or gracefully providing a lead-in for some of the slower pieces, she is easily one of the finest Celtic fiddlers in existance. <br /> <br />Overall, however, this definately at least as good as the original concert. Lisa excells herself, giving the impression that she is really enjoying herself. Méav still has a real mischievous sparkle in her eye, especially when she is singing in Gaelic. The only piece I am not particularly fussed with, is the same on both DVD's: \\"Orinoco Flow\\". To my mind, it lacks the depth of Enya's original- it sounds like they are merely skittering around the top of it. But, to be fair, there would be little point them replicating Enya perfectly. It would defeat the purpose of them performing it at all, if they cannot put their own slant on it, I suppose. Everything else is simply fantastic. Arating of 10 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />No, once you adjust to the new setting (and Slane Castle does provide a very picturesque backdrop), you will be spellbound. If you are not, then you probably have wooden ears and glass eyes... <br />I am already impatient for the next show. <br />

B000002I57|5.0|This collaboration has been a favorite of mine since I discovered the vinyl in high school 40 years ago. The soul of jazz, and in particular, of these two splendid musicians, is laid bare. The \\"sheets of sound,\\" mentioned by another reviewer, are used sparingly as Coltrane uses his horn economically to give us only the notes that are needed. Even the boistrous \\"Bebop\\" leaves us wanting for some jazz archaeologist to dig up a \\"first take\\" that might last 15 minutes longer. Milt Jackson can make you laugh, cry, or just plain get hypnotized with the magic of the mallets. No more words needed. Get this CD!

B00003CX95|4.0|It has been 12 years since Braveheart won the Academy Award for best picture and a release on DVD allows us to review this film in 2007 to determine its continued merit. Does it measure up? <br /> <br />Yes and No. <br /> <br />I gave the film 4 stars because on the whole the film remains strong after 12 years. The scenes of the Scotish landscape and weather conditions were highly realistic and beautiful. The architectural structures, whether they were peasant huts or fortress castles, were very impressive and facilitated the plot and mood of the film in a way that the Lord of the Rings Trilogy captures 7 years later after the release of Braveheart. The filth of common life in 1290 is captured well, for even the highest nobility were vermin infested and encrusted with dirt. The acting of Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks was superb, the best acting job in the whole film. Catherine McCormack as Murron and Sophie Marceau as French Princess Isabella were both excellent casting choices for while both beautiful, McCormack captures the beauty of a strong healthy peasant while Marceau captures the worldly sophisticated beauty of a woman destined for power.  The cinematography was exceptional. One final strength to the film that is certainly relevant to our time, which is that battle against native insurgency is never predictable. Longshanks was extremely lucky that for the most part the Scottish insurgency was willing to fight him face to face in traditional warfare (at least for that time and place) rather than engage in underground gurilla warfare, which is often the choice of insurgent populations.  <br /> <br />What are the drawbacks? <br /> <br />First, considerable historic license was taken to make the film more dramatic and romantic than history would indicate was the actual sequence of events. Second, the violence was a bit over-the-top with terrible scenes of torture and warfare. Third, Gibson was 20 years older than the young William Wallace who began his campaignwhen he was between 20 and 24 and died before he was 36. Fourth, the film is actually a bit too long. It is a 3 hour film that could have been shortened to 2 hours with little lost in terms of story or atmosphere. The fifth drawback is that by today's standards, the depiction of King Edward I could be seen as homophobic. History would imply that King Edward I was homosexual, but this film equates homosexuality with physical and emotional weakness.  <br /> <br />Overall, the film holds up to time and remains entertaining after 12 years.
B0000041BX|5.0|I had not come across the Quartetto Italiano before which is not so surprising as these recordings were made 30 - 40 years ago. However it is a great delight to find them as their playing delightfully taut and energetic. Maybe the tempo is a little slower than expected in the Andante of the G major quartet but it still brings out some wonderful highlights. <br />It would be surprising to find a btter recording anywhere. <br />Phil Rowe
0618680004|3.0|Mr. Dawkins failed in making this book interesting in my opinion. I expected him to be original in his ideas but all he seemed interested in doing was quoting other peoples thoughts. To much time was spent complaining about how atheist are being persecuted,(I'm an atheist myself) and to little time dealing with the \\"nuts and bolts\\" arguements. He keeps plugging one book after another and does little in the way of originality. He did, however, have a couple of good points. One in chapter 10 on \\"consolation\\" and the other concerning \\"religious terrorism\\". If you must read any of his books I reccomend THE BLIND WATCHMAKER or THE SELFISH GENE.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|The movie was fun and everyone in my family liked it from the 20 year old to my youngest. I don't think I'll watch it over and over but my kids will. Kind of like a Mary Popins without the music and lots of more british style humor. Not Benny Hill kind but still distinctly british.
B000G73U5Y|5.0|I like the list, but I am a fan. I recently listened to Gaucho with headphones....

B000HLDFK4|5.0|Its a chick flick, but it was a great story line.It was very well written not your tipical story line.
B00080ZG10|1.0|This movie sucks. I don't know what they were trying to do,but it didn't work.The acting was OK, but the plot and the way it was presented was really bad. I'm glad they were cheap, I gave it away. No wonder you didn't hear much about this movie.
B000J103OI|4.0|The movie was good.  Meryl Streep is good.  I couldn't  help however to reflect on the movie \\"Working Girl\\" in which Signourey Weaver out does Meryl Streep in \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" and Melanie Griffin is great. Want to talk about a nasty rotten boss - get \\"Working Girl\\" and make your own comparison.

B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Hey,lets all relax. As a new Incubus fan sort of!!. First of all let's face it, since the late 90's since kid, limp, etc. thier hasn't been good rock since then. But as time goes one their deserves a break for a band that passes it all. Incubus has finally done it for me these guys are about the best u can get bar none. I mean if creed, kid which is my favorite artist, limp, etc. couldn't make it, these guys kept on going and found out thier worth than advertise. Put it plain and simple these guys are rockstars and let the good times roll. There is nothing wrong with maturing and it helps out a band. I now own everything they have and they in my mind are up thier with Eddy, Kid Rock, Kurt, Plain and Simple Brandon Boyd is simply amazing and it took me till Light Grenades to realize that. He is simply amazing. If half the world knew what good music these day's they understand what good rock is. Simply stated rock and pop is still at it's low. It's sickening to me b/c Incubus is one of the finest bands out there and society in general is all messed up in the head. Plain as day Ive seen the best of the best and Brandon and the boys are up in the top five. Dig, Anna Molly, I wish U were here, Pardon Me, Drive, etc, etc, etc, I'm mean what more in this day to u have to prove before u become one of those bands honestly, lets let rock live on and enjoy what the great past can bring us <br />'
B000AP04OM|5.0|The DVD package was great-six hours of Sound of Music!   Excellent reproduction of the original film, interview with the cast today was the most interesting,
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|i thought the original theatrical release of this was fairly enjoyable,  but having developed an interest in 'director's cuts' since those of the the LOTR movies, i was immediately interested in the possibility that the original might have been significantly improved by additional footage.  it was much better than i had anticipate.  this (the director's cut) is one of the finest motion pictures to come out for quite some time.  it has a tremendous intellectual/philisophical depth as well as stunning cinematography which ensure repeated enjoyable viewing despite the running time (personally, i find longer running times that much more appealing...).  i find ridley scotts approach to scripting and directing semi-fictionalized histories very enjoyable.  in this case, the true history of this subject (fall of jerusalem) is boring at best.  he shows true directorial genius in his ability to make minor modifications to history to make a masterpiece of storytelling.  this work should be enjoyed for his ability to do this so well--not knocked for not making a completely accurate documentary.  i consider this to be the high water mark of scott's career thus far.  very highly recommend.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I am too tired to write a complete review, however this is the best CD I've bought all year.  The songs bring a mix of reggae, hip hop % R&B that is truely unique and enjoyable to listen too.  So good I went out and got his previous CD \\"Halfway Tree\\" and it is just as good.  I was introduced to Damian Marley watching Austin City Limits and haven't taken it out of my CD player since. <br /> <br />Buy it Now!!!!!!
B00000J7SS|5.0|okay, all you yayhoos out there; want some great late night listening? something to relax and edify? well, put away all your new age cds, shuck old yanni in the trash bin, and pick up miles davis's bitches brew. no law says laid-back music can't be powerful and soulful. so here it is: just such music. miles trumpet displays a calm, beautiful and mysterious tone throughout this masterpiece. unconventional jazz to be sure, but accessible to anyone's ears. the great john mclaughlin adds fantastic touches of guitar to the recording, and other master musicians on board are: wayne shorter, chick corea, dave holland, and jack dejohnette. after you get this album and find out how much you love it (which you certainly will if there is a modicum of sanity about you), be sure to pick up \\"in a silent way,\\" too. another classic miles album with a very similar vibe to bitches brew. happy listening.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I bought this as a gift.  The recipient really loved it.  He said it included great bounus materials.  The case that it comes in is very nice and the DVD are nicely organized.  Great gift for anyone who is a big West Wing fan.
B000005JAB|5.0|lush, hypnotic, elegant, subtle and beautiful. small short stories sung perfectly. mr cale's great voice is one of the most underrated instruments in rock history. over the course of 25 years i have listened to this album as much as any other album i have (up there with nick drake, v. morrison's \\"astral weeks,\\" and miles davis's \\"kind of blue\\"). it still strikes chords in me that few other albums reach, all these years on. my life is richer for this recording. thanks, mr cale.

B000001FFJ|5.0|of course you've heard of elevator music. this isn't that. this is parking lot music. music you can hide in like thick dust clouds blown off the side of the highway by bad passersby, whom, after they've burnt rubber and sped on gone laughing and waving goodbye so-long, you can hate as people, but must respect for the cover they've provided you in your illicit doings. these dust clouds. these lovely songs.
B000AP04L0|5.0|There is not a workplace in the world that one can walk into and not find somthing that parallels this something in this movie.  This was Mike Judge's live action directoral debut, and he hit this out of the ballpark.  Known for bevis and butt head and King of the Hill, Judge placed together and excellent cast to bring out the best humor that many of us can relate to in a close quareters office based setting. From the Fax Machine to the Memo's, to The overall dissatisfaction and unfulfillinness of the job.  The there is Milton...just an awsome character.  Laugh until it hurts.  Buy this movie, you will watch it over and over, worth the investment
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|This is an awesome movie in recreating the attack on Pearl Harbor. None have done it better. Tora Tora Tora is better for historical fact, but this movie puts you in the attack. Love story aside, this movie captures the essence of the times and of the attack. You feel the emotion of what has just happened. Don't miss out on a great movie because of the secondary story of the love affair. If all possible see this movie on a large widescreen TV with surround sound. The DVD has DTS sound. I swore bullets were flying by me. They filmed this at Pearl! right at the spots where this whole thing took place. They took bits of the stories from the men and women that were there and put them into the film. For the little bit of historical fact that was not right, like Dan Akaroyed's part in the film; it is overshadowed by the real stories and information that was put in the film. The negative thing about this movie is the lead actors Ben Affleck,Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale. They were good, but needed to be stronger. Now Alec Baldwin who is a great actor anyway was fantastic. A great movie! Great special features on the DVD.
B00005JOCU|2.0|Full Disclosure: I forced myself to see this film at my historic, 63-year-old,  locally owned theater because they are facing a bank foreclosure in 11 days. (If you ever lived in the City of Baltimore - The Senator, with probably the single largest movie screen in Maryland, is in danger of closing it's doors forever.) However, I did enter the theater with hope, no matter how slight, that I would leave feeling entertained!<br /><br />Call me old-fashioned, but I like to care about at least one of the characters in a story. Even in a godforsaken, awful movie I will sit through the whole tedious thing, if I can empathize with at least a single character. In Dreamgirls, I literally felt like I was watching an obnoxious soap opera with very shallow two-dimensional characters. Who cares about a bunch of  rich & famous show business losers?<br /><br />For example, after hearing one character say: \\" I spent half a million dollars (in 1960's dollars) on drinking.\\"  I practically groaned and said to myself, \\"as a young adult, you had nothing better to do with your money during the height of the Vietnam War & the Civil Rights movement then spend it on booze? How inspiring!<br /><br />Granted the cinematography and costumes are absolutely magnificent - the reason for  giving this film two stars, instead of one. But that's icing on the cake.  After a while it wears thin and it certainly does not carry a story to its conclusion.<br /><br />This movie is all flash and no substance. While there is certainly nothing offensive in this overblown production, having a wry sense of humor, like the very clever Chicago, would have done this film wonders. Also having fewer characters, and better editing, would not have hurt either.<br /><br />I found it quite ironic that one of the songs performed in Dreamgirls was along the lines of  \\"I've got soul,\\" something this shallow film sorely lacked!
B000000I3O|5.0|An essential cd if you are into punk rock or just love good music in general.  The Misfits style melds vintage horror film lyrics with Danzig's unique voice and a raw yet simple sound.  Every track on this album is a winner and like Operation Ivy or Led Zeppelin you will find that fans of the band vary on what songs are the best; there are just so many quality tracks to be found.  The recordings on this album aren't crystal clear but do not let that deter you from checking this album out.  A good starting point (perhaps the best choice) if you are new to the misfits.
B000M06K5C|4.0|Wow, you've got to hand it to these guys for such a bold move.  Gone are the stiff, jerky rhythms; spastic guitar riffs; and terse shouts that dominate their indie-rock scene and catalyzed their rise to fame on singles like \\"Helicopter.\\"      Gone, in fact, are the singles altogether.  Instead, Bloc Party has given birth to what has, in the new millenium, become a rare specimen: an album that's meant to be heard collectively, as an album.  But doesn't this fly in the face of the music industry's current assumptions? With the event of file sharing, the development of the Ipod, etc. isn't there much less of a market for this kind of thing?  Evidently, Bloc Party doesn't care a tick.    And after all, youthful non-conformity seems to be the spirit of the record.   Its words are a stew of strung out reflections, accusations, and critiques covering love, libertinism, political fear mongering, drugs, and of course apathetic mall-going drones.  Musically, it rejects the formula of the band's (former?) peers, which derive from the late 70s'-early 80s' alternative bands like Gang of Four, the Talking Heads, and (early) Cure.  Instead it goes for the theatrical, taking cues from, for example, eighties metal bands (don't try to tell me you couldn't mistake the intro to \\"Hunting for Witches\\" for a techno remix of \\"Crazy Train\\"); also early 90's alternative and some of the more recent post-punk, screamo, and neo-prog groups come to mind.  All this, of course, on top of jungle beats and an overarching punk rock sensibility.    Perhaps a more subtle and unlikely though is a hint of Bruce Springsteen (Just hear me out!) on songs like \\"I Still Remember\\" and \\"Sunday.\\"  Here we have two songs with lyrics about being young, looking at society from the margins, and being in love.  They are sung over persistent, chime arpeggios, wall-of-sound instrumentation, and steady break beats.  I can't help but think I'm hearing the dance club version of \\"Born to Run.\\" And don't get me wrong, I think it works, especially thanks to Okereke's persistent themes of disaffectedness and dissent throughout the album.    Perhaps, as we move further along into the decade, the indie rock scene is ready to make this kind of album a success.  Or maybe it came too early for the tipping point and will fade into obscurity.  Either way, I think it took strength, sincerity, and creativity to put out something like this, and for my money, it's a good record.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Slane Castle was a gorgeous setting for Celtic Women's second dvd. Everything, the women, the orchestra, the band, was sensational! Lisa was beautiful as always, singing \\"Caledonia\\", \\"The Blessing\\" and \\"The Voice\\". Meav was outstanding in \\"Dulamen\\", \\"Last Rose of Summer\\", and \\"Danny Boy\\". Orla, with her mysterious voice, sang \\"Newgrange\\" and while playing her harp sang \\"Carrickfergus\\"; both pieces brought chills up and down my spine. Chloe, seventeen now, and always a crowd pleaser, sang \\"The Prayer\\" and \\"Panis Angelicus\\". Mairead, who always gets the crowd going, played \\"Granualle's Dance\\" and \\"Shenanduah-The Pacific Slope\\". She sure can play the violin and move at the same time. Quite a sight to see!! Then there is Hayley Westenra, the new celtic women. She sang beautifully \\"Scarborough Fair\\", \\"Lascia Ch'io Pianga\\" and also sang  \\"The Last Rose Of Summer\\" with Meav.  <br />The opening piece \\"The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun\\" was sung by all and Mairead played her violin. It was so moving to see!! Other pieces as \\"Orinoco Flow\\", \\"Over The Rainbow\\", \\"Beyond the Sea\\", \\"At the Ceili\\", \\"Sing Out\\", \\"Spanish Lady\\", \\"Somewhere\\", \\"Mo Ghile Mear\\", and \\"You Raise me Up\\" were done by four or all five women.  <br />I can see doing \\"You Raise Me Up\\" again because that is their \\"Good-bye\\" song, but \\"Somewhere\\", \\"Orinoco Flow\\". and \\"Danny Boy were on the first Celtic Women, and I would of perferred different songs instead of the same. That was the only thing I found disappointing.  <br />Also, at the end, when the other women got their flowers, I will always wonder if Mairead got floweres too??? Carrying her violin and flowers would of been awkward, I know, but she could of managed it. She did such a superb job throughout the show, she deserved flowers too!!!!
0618680004|1.0|I was interested in reading this book because I have found Mr. Dawkins' other books interesting and well written. This book, however, is possibly the most poorly written book I have read in a long time. I also do not appriciate the \\"holier than thou\\" attitude he takes throughout the book. I would also have thought that he would have done some research before he wrote the book, its ashame.
055350259X|5.0|I read this book only because of how much I liked \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything,\\" not because I ever plan to visit Australia. And I was absolutely correct in doing so. Hugely informative, fascinating, and often laugh-out-loud funny. Don't miss reading this book. (I listened to some of the audio version of the book -- narrated by Bryson himself. I liked it even more than the hard copy version.)
1582701709|5.0|The Law of Attraction is a great idea, and that is what the secret is all about. The problem lies in how this wonderful law is presented. If you are not thrilled by paranormal channeling from another dimension, or can't stand anecdotal \\"facts\\" or suppositions, then you will not enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for hardcore advice on how to achieve wealth, you would be better served to read books by Robert Allen, Mike Kiyosaki, etc. You may also want to read \\"Think and Grow Rich,\\" by Napoleon Hill, or \\"The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth,\\" by Phillip Collinsworth. <br />
B000MS1XXI|3.0|Sorry for that title, but this movie doesn't exactly inspire eloquence.  I watched it on a projector with an HDTV converter, and I really enjoyed the cinematography, but even though Jamie did a great job and watching Colin Farrell is a heck of a lot better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, I think I might have shut if off halfway on a small screen.  Perhaps it's good rainy day viewing.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|What an awesome movie. I can't believe that this movie wasn't more popular at the theaters. I'd love to tell you about it, but you just have to see it for yourself to believe me.

6305127646|5.0|The Saint is an amazing adventure with a true heart and soul. My wife and I watch it several times a year and it always captivates us. Unlike the Hollywood schlock of late the Saint truly delivers thrills and adventures with a soul and emotion, something missing in the films of today. I traveled through out eastern Europe quite alot in the time period portrayed in this film and can say that it is bristling with true accuracy and atmosphere.<br /><br />This is by far one of my favorite films. This film brings me back to some personal grand adventures a decade ago. The music is great, the cinematography is phenomenal, and of course there are two endings !!<br /><br />Yes the Saint has an alternate ending in which Simon Templar fights Tretiak's son to the death in the Tretiak mansion as the Russian military launches a full on attack onto the manor with tanks. A spectacular ending I saw in a European version. Hope to God that Philip Noyce will grace us diehard fans of this wonderful film with a deluxe DVD. I would pay $100.00 for that.<br /><br />THE SAINT IS A TRUE CLASS ACT !!!  Val Kilmer is a genius and Elisabeth Shue is a world class charming cutie
B000LE1FAY|5.0|Belinda Carlisle is back - Boy, is she ever!  \\"voila\\" is the absolute best CD of her career!  I was leary when I first heard her new CD was sung entirely in French, but I was wrong to be uneasy!  From the moment you put this disc in the player, it is a wonderful musical adventure!  Belinda's voice is pitch perfect!  This album is getting outstanding reviews across the board (as it should!).  Belinda deseves a Grammy Award for her work on \\"VOILA\\".  I hope she will not be overlooked for this accomplishment.  I LOVE this CD, and loved it from the first moment I heard the songs!  Belinda sounds great! She looks fabulous on the cover too!  The best songs, in my opinion, on \\"Voila\\" are: \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\", \\"Pourtant Tu M'Aimes\\", \\"Bonnie Et Clyde\\", \\"Avec Le Temps\\", \\"Contact\\", and \\"La Vie En Rose\\".  Everyone should own a copy of this CD --- If you do, you will play it over & over & over & over again!

B000ICL3KG|3.0|Feel compelled to share the following with you as the hype behind this movie and the idolisation of Gore at Sundance and in the media misses something very relevant that is evaded in this film...the Gore/Clinton <br />record on climate change. <br /> <br />By MITCHEL COHEN <br /> <br />Al Gore's film, \\"An Inconvenient Truth,\\" raises the issue of global warming in a way that scares the bejeezus out of viewers, as it should since the consequences of global climate change are truly earth-shaking. The former Vice-President does a good job of presenting the graphic evidence, exquisite and terrifying pictures that document the melting of the polar ice caps and the effects on other species, new diseases, and rising ocean levels. <br /> <br />But, typically, the solutions Gore offers are standard Democratic Party fare. You'd never know by watching this film that Gore and Clinton ran this country for 8 years and that their policies -- as much as those of the Bush regime -- helped pave the way for the crisis we face today. <br /> <br />Gore never critiques the system causing the global ecological crisis. At one point, he even mourns the negative impact of global warming on U.S. oil pipelines. Oh, the horror! What it all comes down to, for Gore and the Democrats, is that we need to shift away from reliance on fossil fuels and tweak existing consumption patterns. <br /> <br />Even there, Gore and Clinton did nothing to improve fuel efficiency in the U.S. -- a topic which Gore talks about in the movie without any hint that he'd once actually been in a position to do something about it. The question Gore poses is, Who can best manage the relatively minor solutions he recommends, the Democrats or Republicans? For Gore, it's sort of \\"trust US, not THEM, to deal with this situation because they are liars and we're not.\\" Well, should we trust him? <br /> <br />As Joshua Frank writes, during the campaign for president in 1992 Gore promised a group of supporters that the Clinton-Gore EPA would never approve a hazardous waste incinerator located near an elementary school in Liverpool, Ohio, which was operated by WTI. \\"Only three months into Clinton's tenure,\\" Frank writes, \\"the EPA issued an operating permit for the toxic burner. Gore raised no qualms. Not surprisingly, most of the money behind WTI came from the bulging pockets of Jackson Stephens, who just happened to be one of the Clinton-Gore's top campaign contributors.\\"(1) <br />But failing to shut down toxic incinerators is just the tip of their great betrayal. In the film, Gore references the Kyoto Accords and states that he personally went to Kyoto during the negotiations, giving the impression that he was a key figure in fighting to reduce air pollution emissions that destroy the ozone layer. What he omits is that his mission in going to Kyoto was to scuttle the Accords, to block them from moving forward. And he succeeded. <br /> <br />The Clinton-Gore years were anything but environment-friendly. Under Clinton-Gore, more old growth forests were cut down than under any other recent U.S. administration. \\"Wise Use\\" committees -- set up by the lumber industry -- were permitted to clearcut whole mountain ranges, while Clinton-Gore helped to \\"greenwash\\" their activities for public consumption. <br /> <br />Under Clinton-Gore, the biotech industry was given carte blanche to write the US government's regulations (paltry as they are) on genetic engineering of agriculture, and to move full speed ahead with implementing the private patenting of genetic sequences with nary a qualm passing Gore's lips. <br /> <br />You'd think watching this film that Gore is just some concerned professor who never had access to power or held hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock in Occidental Petroleum (driving the U'wa off their lands in Colombia), let alone was the Number Two man actually running the U.S. government! <br /> <br />\\"Gore, like Clinton who quipped that 'the invisible hand has a green thumb,' extolled a free-market attitude toward environmental issues,\\" writes Frank, who goes on to quote Jeffrey St. Clair: \\"Since the mid-1980s Gore has argued with increasing stridency that the bracing forces of market capitalism are potent curatives for the ecological entropy now bearing down on the global environment. He is a passionate disciple of the gospel of efficiency, suffused with an inchoate technophilia.\\"(2) <br /> <br />Before Kyoto, before the Clinton-Gore massive depleted uranium bombings of Yugoslavia and Iraq, before their missile \\"deconstruction\\" of the only existing pharmaceutical production facility in northern Africa in the Sudan (which exacerbated the very serious problems there, as we're seeing in Darfur today), there was NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. The task of Clinton-Gore was to push through this legislation which not even strong Republican administrations under Reagan or Bush Sr. had been able to do. Since its inception, NAFTA has undermined U.S. environmental laws, chased production facilities out of the U.S. and across the borders, vastly increased pollution from Maquilladoras (enterprise zones) along the U.S./Mexico border and helped to undermine the indigenous sustainable agrarian-based communities in southern Mexico -- as predicted by leftists in both countries, leading to the Zapatista uprising from those communities on January 1, 1994, the day NAFTA went into effect. <br /> <br />Clinton-Gore also approved the destructive deal with the sugar barons of South Florida arranged by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, which doomed the Everglades. (In fact, Clinton was on the phone with Alfonso Fanjul, Jr., the chief of the sugar barons, while Monica Lewinsky was busy doing her thing in her famous blue dress under Clinton's desk.) <br /> <br />Early in Clinton-Gore's first administration, they pledged they would stop the plunder of the Northwest forests, writes former Village Voice columnist James Ridgeway. \\"They then double-crossed their environmental backers. Under Bush Sr., the courts had enjoined logging in the Northwest habitats of the spotted owl. Clinton-Gore persuaded environmentalists to join them in axing the injunction. The Clinton administration went before a Reagan-appointed judge who had a record as a stalwart environmentalist and with the eco toadies in tow, got him to remove the injunction, and with it the moratorium on existing timber sales.\\"(3)  <br /> <br />Then Gore and Clinton \\"capitulated to the demands of Western Democrats and yanked from its initial budget proposals a call to reform grazing, mining, and timber practices on federal lands. When Clinton convened a timber summit in Portland, Oregon, in April 1994, the conference was, as one might expect, dominated by logging interests. Predictably, the summit gave way to a plan to restart clear-cutting in the ancient forests of the Pacific Northwest for the first time in three years, giving the timber industry its get rich wish.\\"(4) <br /> <br />Gore and Clinton sent to Congress the infamous Salvage Rider, known to radical environmentalists as the \\"Logging without Laws\\" bill, \\"perhaps the most gruesome legislation ever enacted under the pretext of preserving ecosystem health.\\" Like Bush's \\"Healthy Forests\\" plan, the Clinton-Gore act \\"was chock full of deception and special interest pandering. 'When [the Salvage Rider] bill was given to me, I was told that the timber industry was circulating this language among the Northwest Congressional delegation and others to try to get it attached as a rider to the fiscal year Interior Spending Bill,' environmental lawyer Kevin Kirchner says. 'There is no question that representatives of the timber industry had a role in promoting this rider. That is no secret.'\\"(5) What the Salvage Rider did was to \\"temporarily exempt ... salvage timber sales on federal forest lands from environmental and wildlife laws, administrative appeals, and judicial review,\\" according to the Wilderness Society --long enough for multinational lumber and paper corporations to clear-cut all but a sliver of the U.S.'s remaining old growth forests. <br /> <br />\\"Thousands of acres of healthy forestland across the West were rampaged. Washington's Colville National Forest saw the clear cutting of over 4,000 acres. Thousands more in Montana's Yak River Basin, hundreds of acres of pristine forest land in Idaho, while the endangered Mexican Spotted Owl habitat in Arizona fell victim to corporate interests. Old growth trees in Washington's majestic Olympic Peninsula -- home to wild Steelhead, endangered Sockeye salmon, and threatened Marbled Murrieta -- were chopped with unremitting provocation by the US Forest Service.\\"(6) <br /> <br />The assault on nature continued with Gore's blessing. <br /> <br />Around the same time, Clinton-Gore appointee Carol Browner, head of the EPA, was quoted in the NY Times as having said that the administration would be \\"relaxing\\" the Delaney Clause (named after its author, Congressman James Delaney, D-NY). Congress had inserted this clause into section 409 of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in 1958. It prohibited FDA approval of any food additive found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Alone among all food-related directives, this legislation put the onus on the manufacturers to demonstrate that their products were safe before they were allowed to become commercially available. (7) A federal appeals court in July 1992 expanded the jurisdiction of the Delaney Clause, ruling that it was applicable to cancer-causing pesticides in processed food. Browner retracted her comment, claiming she'd never said it, but the proof was in the pudding. The ban on cancer-causing additives (the \\"Precautionary Principle\\") that had held through the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush, Sr. administrations was finally removed, not by the Republicans but by the Clinton-Gore administration. Instead of expanding the Delaney clause to protect produce and other unprocessed foods, the new Food Quality Protection Act legislation permitted \\"safe\\" amounts of carcinogenic chemicals (as designated by the Environmental Protection Agency) to be added to all food. (According to Peter Montague, editor of Rachel's Weekly, \\"no one knows how 'safe amounts' of carcinogens can be established, especially when several carcinogens and other poisons are added simultaneously to the food of tens of millions of people.) Nevertheless, the Clinton-Gore administration spun this as \\"progress.\\" <br /> <br />The Clinton administration, with guidance from Gore's office, also cut numerous deals over the pesticide Methyl Bromide despite its reported effects of contributing to Ozone depletion and its devastating health consequences on farm workers picking strawberries. <br /> <br />Much is being made these days about the need to save the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. But Clinton-Gore opened the National Petroleum Reserve \\" 24 million untouched acres adjacent to the refuge, home to a large caribou herd and numerous arctic species \\" to oil drilling. The chief beneficiaary of this was Arco, a major ($1.4 million) contributor to the Democratic Party. At the same time, writes James Ridgeway, \\"Clinton dropped the ban on selling Alaskan oil abroad. This also benefits Arco, which is opening refineries in China. So although the oil companies won the right to exploit Alaskan oil on grounds that to do so would benefit national development, Clinton-Gore unilaterally changed the agreement so that it benefits China's industrial growth.\\"(8) <br /> <br />Not once in the entire film does Gore criticize this awful environmental record or raise the critical questions we need to answer if we are to effectively reverse global warming: Is it really the case that the vast destruction of our environment that went on under his watch and, continuing today, is simply a result of poor consumer choices and ineffective government policies? Is the global environmental devastation we are facing today rectifiable with some simple tuning-up, as Gore proposes? <br /> <br />Neither he -- as point man for the Clinton administration on environmental issues -- nor Clinton-Gore's Energy Secretary Bill Richardson (with major ties to Occidental Petroleum), nor the Democratic Party in general offer anything more than putting a tiny Band-Aid on the earth's gaping wounds, which they themselves helped to gash open. <br /> <br />Clearly, the vast destruction of the global ecology is a consequence not just of poor governmental policies but of the capitalist system's fundamental drive towards Growth and what passes for Development -- Grow or Die. Environmental activists won't find in Gore the kind of systemic analysis that is needed to stop global warming. Instead, we need to look elsewhere for that sort of deep systemic critique. <br />

B000HBK3MM|4.0|I feel really bad about criticizing this album and this artist for a number reasons, but I do have one fault that stands out to me, and I'll get to that. <br />  <br />First of all, it's so refreshing to hear a young female singer(and I apologize for singling her out as a female, but you have to do that), that actually sings a song with a simple jazzy type band backing her, than the same old copying of 99% of the young female singers of today, who do nothing but eventually scream, and have three or four backup dancers, simply to distract us from the talent that's not really there. <br /> <br />Corinne has a beautiful voice, very soft and soothing, the type of singing that you could relax, sit back with a glass of wine, and possibly fall asleep to, but not due to her talent. She's just relaxing to listen to. <br /> <br />The one fault that I have is that the majority of songs on this album seem to have basically the same melody, but with different lyrics. If she would have only changed the melodies around a little.  That's the one small thing that with time listening to the album, it gets a little boring.   <br /> <br />Would I recommend this album? Certainly. She is so much more accomplished than the majority of the other female singers that we get tired of hearing about every day. I told you I hated to get picky, but I have to tell the truth as I see it. If I would have the chance to tell her what I have said, I would hope that she would accept it as consructive criticizm. I think if she is able to see that one flaw, she will be remembered for a long time. Thanks for the time. <br /> <br />

B00006JU7T|5.0|This early 70's classic starring Al Pacino as Frank Serpico , a NYC police oficer who's fight against corruption led to the Knapp Commission hearings and reforms , is a film that still pacts dramatic punch. While somewhat dated and Pacino's hippy cop act can seem almost campy 35 years later, his overall performance in this is still one of his best and following the Godfather established him as a major star.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent as well, with so many guys playing tough ,jaded NYC cops from the era.<br /><br />I guess the definition of a classic is a movie that represents it's era and yet can be viewed and enjoyed years later. Serpico certainly meets that criteria.

A lone mysterious man turns up in town and takes on evil ,wins over the local underdogs and rides off into the sunset.<br /><br />What makes Pale Rider different is the subtext of some undefined supernatural quality to Eastwood's character. He arrives wearing a preacher's collar and is only known as Preacher. Yet clearly there is a history to the man that the film never fully explains and leaves the viewers to draw their own conclusions.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed and well written, Pale Rider was the best western in many years and started a revival of the genre.

I do agree with some of the posters that the one \\"oddball\\" of \\"Sing Out\\" is a little jarring...but overall it's still worth 5 stars due to the quality of voices. <br /> <br />I am seriously in love with At The Celli and Spanish Lady...I think I made my car shake as I was sitting at a red light.  The other major higlight is the first track \\"The Sky...\\" <br /> <br />If you have to make a choice between the \\"regular\\" vs \\"deluxe\\"  go for the deluxe.

People who have never heard any music from them other than \\"Burning Down The House\\" watch this DVD and go buy albums.  I love sharing this DVD with friends because it opens people up to something new.  I had a friend call me a week after watching this DVD, and he said, \\"I didn't think I was going to like it, but I've thought about it a lot since we watched it.  It's just different.\\"  To add to that, it's captivating, inspiring, and moving.
B000J10EQU|2.0|Let me say simply not to waste your time unless you are extremely bored or find sitcoms on the WB intellectually engaging. <br /> <br />This was a pretty sad effort from the word go.

B000003TA4|3.0|Yes, this album kicked off the '90s. Yes, it changed the face of mainstream rock. Yes, it saved us from hair metal and brought us back someplace further down to earth (whether it was a good place or bad place all depends on one's taste). <br /> <br />But historical importance aside, this is basically Nirvana with bells and whistles. Studio gloss may have served them well as far as making them household names of epic proportions and, again, presenting something new to popular music, but as far as giving them any real artistic credibility or showcasing their raw (emphasis on RAW) punk roots, it accomplishes very little, in my opinion. Punk and polish do not mix. <br /> <br />A wholly decent, enjoyable album regardless, but if I want to hear the true essence of Kurt and the boys, I just pop in any of their other releases.

B00006BTCA|5.0|If you're into moody, atmospheric, and upbeat rock I'd recommend this album.  It is immensely catchy upon first hearing and the rhythyms here are really tight.  You can clearly hear Carlos' base playing and the guitars harmonize really well.  The lyrics can be open for interpretation but are more or less about love and relationships.  The guitar playing isn't necessarily anything special or complicated but the way that it's presented and played makes it worth listening to.  I highly recommend this cd.

0743289412|3.0|I started reading \\"Lisey's Story\\" several weeks ago.  And it kept me interested; but I wanted to find more time to finish it.  So, yesterday, while recuperating from a cold and sore throat, I took to the couch and completed the entire novel.  Stephen King laces this novel with his own vocabulary. He enjoys making up words and most of them are related to Bool.   He takes you in and out of Bool with his moving metaphors and grisly descriptions of the strange family sicknesses.  Both Lisey and her husband had blood cutting in their family history.  Besides that, Scott, Lisey's husband has the talent of being able to continue in Lisey's life directing her after death.  So, that makes her story even more bizarre.  The cover of the book with the shovel appealed to me; it's very eye-catching.  After you read the novel, you can understand how the shovel plays a major part in the action.  It's a talisman and a protector for Lisey.  She even takes it to bed in the beginning of the book.  My main thought of the book was that is was a widow's way of saying goodbye to her dead husband.  But, after reading and analyzing the symbols, I think that Stephen King was stirring up the imagination of his readers again with the love and hate contained in the family life of the characters and through the Boo'ya Moon, he tells us that was the land of creativity and darkness that lives in everyone.  <br /> <br />One of the passages where Lisey describes what could have caused the death of her husband demonstrates the incrediblity of Stephen's details:  \\"And what had caused his final illness?  His death certificate claimed penumonia, and she had no problem with that.  They could have put 'Nibbled to death by ducks' on it and he'd have been just as dead--but she couldn't help wondering.  Had his death been on a flower that he had picked up and smelled, or a bug that had slipped to its sipper under his skin as the sun went down red in its house of thunder?  Did he get it on a quick visit to Boo'ya Moon a week or a month before his final reading in Kentucky, or had it been waiting for decades, ticking like a clock?  It might have been in a single grain of dirt that got under one fingernail while he was digging his brother's grave.  Just  a single bad bug that lay asleep as the years passed, finally waking up at his computer one day when a reluctant word finally came to him and he snapped his fingers in satisfaction. Maybe--terrible thought, but who knew?--she had even brought it back herself from one of her own visits, a lethal mite in a tiny dot of pollen he had kissed from the tip of her nose.\\"

1400044162|5.0|Most of us will have little knowledge of the Biafra war, except, possibly, for the media's haunting images of starving children.  Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie brings her people's world to us in this beautifully crafted, deeply moving, novel. Set in Nigeria during the 1960s, the narrative alternates between the optimistic early years of the decade and the civil war period at the end of it. With her extraordinary storytelling skill, Adichie draws the reader into an absorbing account of fictionalized realities that is impossible to put down - or to forget after the last page is read.  With this, her second novel, she confirms her international reputation, established first with Purple Hibiscus, as one of the leading new voices of African literature.<br /><br />While the war for Biafra's independence, born out of highly complex Nigerian and international political circumstances,  provides the essential context for the novel, Adichie's focus is on the personal and private, the struggle of the civilian Igbo population. Her depiction of the horrors of war, the starvation and destruction is realistic. Yet she does not allow these scenes to take over and succeeds in not overwhelming the reader with them. By concentrating on one family and its close circle of friends and neighbours, Adichie creates an intimate portrait of these people's lives during both these critical periods. She paints her characters and their ongoing interactions against the panoramic view of events and environments that influence their lives and challenges their peace and even their existence.<br /><br />Central to her story are the twin sisters, Olanna and Kainene, from a wealthy middleclass Igbo family. The beautiful Olanna leaves Lagos for a university environment to be with her political firebrand lover, the math professor Odenigbo. Kainene, on the other hand, having inherited their father's talents, shines as a confident business woman. English researcher and writer, Richard, friend of Odenigbo, falls under her spell. Adichie explores the interactions sisterly intimacy and love as well as its serious tests with sensitivity and empathy for both. Through them and their surroundings she also touches on the social, political and religious tensions of the time.<br /><br />The list of main characters wouldn't be complete without Ugwu. Brought into the Odenigbo household as a house boy, he matures from the naive village boy to become a well educated, articulate and caring member of the extended family. In fact, Ugwu acts as a sort of understudy to the narrator, adding a very distinctly personal flair to the description of events and bridging the reality of his own family's rural environment with that of the intellectually stimulating social gatherings at the professor's house.<br /><br />During the war years, intimacies, friendships and loyalties are put to the test. Will they survive the dramatically changed circumstances that the group finds itself in?  Some are evicted from their homes and have to join the endless stream of refugees to find shelter and food for survival. Others move into remote rural areas to escape the fighting. Olanna's efforts to maintain her dignity and to protect her small family come alive on the page. So does Kainene's work with her confidence that she can beat adversity and barriers in her efforts to maintain the supplies for a refugee camp. They don't lose hope or humanity.  Odenigbo and Richard have their own demons to tackle. And Ugwu juggles his various roles while attempting to maintain something of a private life for himself.<br /><br />Half of a Yellow Sun, also the symbol of the short-lived Biafran state, represents some of the best that storytelling has to offer.  With strong imagery and beautiful language Adichie has created a masterwork. [Friederike Knabe].

B000J103PC|2.0|I loved the book when I read it, and was looking forward to buying the DVD. I bought it on the second day of release, and watched it a few days later.<br /><br />I was disappointed. The start of the film has a couple of montage scenes (good once, but twice?!) and whole chunks of the book are cut out. Meryl Streep playing Miranda Priestly, was so quiet, I kept turning the volume up, but still couldn't hear a word she was saying. It's said Meryl based this on Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry films, but it quite frankly, annoyed the hell out of me.<br /><br />I don't agree with some of the other reviewers who mentioned that the film works better without some of the \\"duller subplots\\" from the book. Andy's best friend Lily featured majorly in the book and even had a pivotal role in the finale. So did Andy's boyfriend and her parents. But they're basically forgotten about, apart from a small glimpse of her father. I liked Lily's story in the film, it showed how strong Andy's friendship was, but she gets no more than a couple of scenes, and a couple of forgettable lines. I don't agree the loss of these scenes made for a more \\"streamlined\\" film. I actually thought it would have made it better.<br /><br />The first half of the film sticks quite closely to the book, but leaves out the funny moments. The second half more or less goes it's own way, and I ended up losing it, and not really paying it my full attention. There are still some bits kept from the second half of the book, but not enough.<br /><br />The finale of the film is changed as well. With Lily's pivotal role forgotten about, it changes completely, and in a very unsatisfactory way too. I much preferred the ending of the book, but I did think it was good the way you saw Miranda at the end.<br /><br />The only saving grace about this film (apart from Anne Hathaway), was Emily Blunt's scene stealing performance as Emily. She is cattily on target with her portrayal of Emily, a perfect opposite to the wide-eyed innocent of Anne Hathaway. But her storyline gets partly changed as well towards the end, but not in such a major way.<br /><br />Reviewers calling this a comedy are so far off the mark that it's laughable. What did you find funny apart from Emily Blunt's eye-rolls and her witty comments? There's nothing funny about this. As another reviewer mentioned, it could have so been another Princess Diaries - the transformation from \\"I don't care how I look\\" to \\"Wow, don't I look good?\\" is seen right through the film.<br /><br />If you want to get it, get it cheap, and read the book first.

B000002H70|5.0|I just wanted to take a moment to shill for \\"Untitled\\", which for some reason hardly anyone else has talked about in their reviews and is the best song on the album.  The arrangement is incredibly simple, and the lyrics consist of one verse repeated--yet the emotional and poetic value are the heart of the entire album for me. <br /> <br />There is no better opening than \\"Plainsong\\" or closing than \\"Untitled.\\"  What a fantastic concept.  And \\"Lovesong\\" is a true oddity, reinforcing how melancholic the rest of the songs are.  From any other artist, on any other album, \\"Lovesong\\" would sound sad.  \\"Disintegration\\" is another major highlight, a lyrical collage evoking the disintegration of a once-lived life. <br /> <br />I always loved 'Wish' and 'Kiss Me . . . ' for their bizarre variety, each song contrasting the others around it, and this diversity was how I had come to characterize The Cure.  But it's amazing what they can do when they drop the happy-tinged sad songs (like \\"The Perfect Girl,\\" and \\"Wendy Time\\") and focus on being relentlessly, overtly lugubrious.  It's like coming home.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|I grew up in the late 80's and early 90's, and by the time I finished high school in 1996 I was an avid Megadeth fan, having been turned onto their music by some friends I jammed with. I knew and loved Peace Sells, I knew Countdown, I bought Youthanasia as soon as it came out, etc. Then I started to grow tired of heavy metal and started broadening my tastes. I still listened to Megadeth from time to time, but I wasn't obsessive by any means. I haven't really kept up with them since then to be honest. I was at a library sale and saw this album for 50 cents so I decided it would be worth the \\"Risk\\" (yes, I know that was horrible) <br /> <br />You can imagine my surprise when I listened the first time and heard violin, drum machines, and a synth bass on the opening track. This was clearly not the Megadeth I had come to know and love. But that's just the thing - it was so different, yet, I loved it. Every time it seemed as though they would return to their trademark thrash sound, they would pull out something unexpected. A drum machine here, a violin there, an unexpected tempo change, a pretty classical guitar part, there was always something to catch me off guard. The songwriting is strong for the most part, and the hooks are just huge. I can understand why longtime fans didn't like this album, but speaking as a longtime fan, I think it is absolutely brilliant. Sure, it's more radio friendly than you would expect, but does that always have to be a bad thing? Keep an open mind and you just might find yourself falling in love with this album. I don't have the album before it or the ones after it, so I'm not sure how this fits in the logical progression of their sound, but it doesn't matter. This is a great disc, and I encourage anyone who thinks differently to give it a few more spins and see if it grows on you. <br /> <br />Oh, and to the reviewer who compared this to Reload... I can definitely see where you're coming from, as both albums were the logical end of the path towards commercial radio. But I definitely have to disagree with your conclusion. I thought Reload was absolutely horrible, with the exception of a few tracks it was completely unlistenable. However, I think Risk is great, I would rank it just below their best albums. So to anyone who took that comparison to heart and didn't bother with this album, give it a shot, you just might like what you hear.

B00006878K|5.0|It would appear that \\"King Of The Blues Guitar \\" contains the same tracks with additional songs thrown in. However this album was groundbreaking/trendsetting when it first was released.*I'm not seeking to use these terms  flippantly as is the case with many reviewers.By the term \\"trendsetting\\" i mean to say it actually influenced thousands of guitarists including Eric Clapton who stole the lick from the intro of the title song as well as the melody for \\"Years Go Passing By\\" and  used it for his intro to \\"Layla\\".  The cover was striking and it's still rated as Albert's best ever release. \\"Personal Manager\\" for me is the standout track because Albert pulls out all the stops and ends up way past the 17 fret.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|To take down South Boston's Irish Mafia, the police send in one of their own to infiltrate the underworld, not realizing the syndicate has done likewise in Martin Scorsese's Oscar-nominated crime thriller, for which he won a Best Director Golden Globe. While an undercover cop (Leonardo DiCaprio) curries favor with the mob kingpin (Jack Nicholson), a career criminal (Matt Damon) rises through the police ranks. But both sides soon discover there's a mole among them.  <br /> <br />Remaking the 2002 Hong Kong film, \\"Infernal Affairs,\\" screenwriter William Monahan keeps a lot of the plot details the same, but Martin Scorsese's take on the material results in a much darker, more brutal, illicit, and devastatingly tragic film (not to mention even more rambunctiously entertaining, filled with great dialogue, great editing, great performances, and great music). It's the first Scorsese film that could be considered a \\"cop movie,\\" as we're all more used to Scorsese's pure-bred gangster fare, but the film exists in a world so ubiquitously infested with violence, debauchery, and betrayal among cops and criminals alike that Nicholson's character can't help but ask, \\"What's the difference?\\" In the beginning Scorsese has a good time observing how DiCaprio's and Damon's characters fit into the roles they have to step into for the benefit of the organizations they have sworn allegiance to and for the downfall of the ones they are now a part of. Damon is conniving and working his way up the ladder, given respect and admiration by the people he is fighting against. DiCaprio is violent and desperate, living in fear, living the life of a criminal to try and contribute to their demise. It's this type of dramatic irony that Scorsese has the most fun with in this film and the movie succeeds as a fascinating examination of these lifestyles of grandeur and of disgrace and of the lies these men are living.  <br /> <br />As the film progresses it becomes steeped in twists, turns, and deceptions, none of which are the type of annoyingly contrived plot points so common in today's thrillers. As the audience, we are on our toes from beginning to end as the tension becomes tighter and tighter. At the end of it all, Scorsese's film is intense entertainment as well as a perceptive and intelligent film that scrutinizes the desire to serve the law--in whatever way that may fit--versus the desire to live in glory of doing so. This is an outstanding movie.
1400031567|5.0|I thank fellow reviewer Leonard Fleisig for bringing this author to my attention. The writing is simply superb. I am very interested in reading more books by the Mankell. So far, I have bought and read six novels in the Wallander series.<br /><br />I thought that the novel was excellent up to a point. But then when the bloody and gruesome murders go on and on - and right to the end - it becomes a bit too much. For that reason I think that Faceless Killers or One Step Behind are his best novels. But the present novel is not far behind. This problem with the murders is that the story is set over a very short time frame, and Wallander does not have enough time to solve the case. I thought that Mankell was doing a great job with the novel and it might be his best, until the murders become tiresome. The novel reminded me a bit of the Peter Robinson Inspector Banks series and of course here the multiple murders set the structure of the novel.<br /><br />The book opens with a map of southern Sweden showing the location of the town of Ystad. The latter is the primary setting, although the crimes are spread around the southern part of Sweden. The police station is located in Ystad which is near the most southerly part of Sweden, south and east of Malmo and on the Baltic. Malmo itself is on the west coast of Sweden, just 10 km across the narrow straights from Copenhagen. Part of the tale takes place in Malmo and part in Helsingborg, north of Malmo.<br /><br />I will not give away the plot and the essential plot elements are outlined by the publisher: there is a series of murders and an unrelated suicide. The policeman, Kurt Wallender, takes a personal interest in the suicide, and is somewhat \\"sidetracked.\\"<br /><br />This is a great and a fast read that I was able to read with a great deal of enjoyment in less than a day or two - even though it is 500 pages. I read it while staying at a hotel in southern Sweden, not too far from the crime scene, and that the details and descriptions of the places, people, and other details are made to seem authentic.<br /><br />This is a book that I highly recommend, but because of the multiple murders it merits between 4 and 5 stars. The writing is smooth and flawless.and other details are made to seem authentic.     This is a book that I highly recommend, but because of the multiple murders it merits between 4 and 5 stars.

The best of the album is by far \\"Duke's travel-Duke's end\\" <br />The hits \\"Misundertanding\\" and Turn it on again\\" are totally burned songs, we have heard them too often.

0767817710|4.0|If you take this as a serious western, you'll be disappointed. But if you approach it as a nicely crafted, almost satirical hommage to the spaghetti westerns ( especially \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\"; if you are not familiar with this film, you won't get a lot of the references),this is a lot of fun to watch. Of course the story is predictable and vacuous; but Hackman is great (the man is incapable of bad acting), diCaprio is adequate, and Crowe turns in a nice, understated performance. The only miscast is Stone, who acts as if she doesn't know what the heck she is doing in this movie.  The music is good, the camera work very nicely done, and the shootouts well-staged. This isn't great movie-making, but I think Sergio Leone would consider this film a compliment.

B000AOEMXM|4.0|On September of 2001, the UPN network and Star Trek producer Rick Berman with writer/producer Brannon Braga introduced viewers to Enterprise (later renamed Star Trek Enterprise in season three).    This fifth live action series from the franchise took place a century before James T. Kirk's five year voyage of the original series. This series follows the pioneering voyage of the first warp five ships in the early days of Starfleet, before the formation of the United Federation of Planets.    The crew of the NX-01 led by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Barkla), consisted of the Vulcan liaison/first officer Typo (Jolene Blalock), Chief Engineer Charles \\"Trip\\" Tucker III (The great Connor Trennier), British armory officer Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating),Communication Officer/ linguist Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), Helmsman Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), and Denoblian Chief Medical Officer Phlox (John Billingsly).    The show had the distinction of being the series that ruined an almost forty year old franchise. But in the end its only crime was bad timing, the creator's total disregard to continuity, as well as wasting time putting around the galaxy, and focusing on the confusing Temporal Cold War while fans wanted to see the early days of Starfleet leading up to the founding of the United Federation of Planets. At first the series was sampled by Trekkers curious about the beginnings of the Federation, which wasn't addressed until the fourth and final season. Viewership dwindled by its racy tone, disregard of continuity, the fact that NX-01 looked technologically advanced to Kirk's NCC-1701,the unnecessary \\"Temporal Cold War\\" and it's theme song which was a AOR pop song(!!!!).The stories felt perfunctory as to appeal to a larger audience, which was the previous Star Trek Voyager's biggest flaw.    Aside from the shows fallibilities, the first season boasted great episodes in Broken Bow (the series pilot), The Andorian Incident, Breaking the Ice, Cold Front, Dear Doctor, Shuttlepod One, and Shockwave (the season finale cliffhanger).    By the time of the second season, it was pretty obvious that Enterprise was a disappointment to viewers who felt the show direction was weak as well as \\"Franchise Trek\\" becoming stale (indicated by 2002's Star Trek Nemesis's poor box office performance). After the follow-up to the excellent first season finale (Shockwave pt II),the season consisted of weak episodes(Precious Cargo, Canamar,The Crossing, Horizon, and the terrible A Night in Sickbay),among some of its finest(Carbon Creek, Minefield, Stigma, Future Tense,Judgment,Cogenitor, Regeneration, and the best Enterprise episodes ever, Dead Stop ).Fans who first tuned in to see how the steps were taken for the UFP to be formed(which would be touched upon during the last episodes of the fourth and final season) had to contend with two seasons worth of \\"Boldly Going Nowhere.    Sensing a change in direction was needed, the show took on a different course as Enterprise respond to an attack on earth (\\"The Expanse\\", an allusions to 9-11), and try to stop the Xindi race from developing a weapon of mass destruction. This story arc continued into the third season, as Archer's new mission of stopping the Xindi from destroying Earth with a superweapon.Albiet,there were some weak semi stand alone episodes (Extinction, North Star, Carpenter St.,and E2),among classic episodes which ranks with some of the franchises best(Impulse,Twilight,Azati Prime/Damage, The Counsel/Countdown/Zero Time).Staff member Manny Coto was responsible for new direction which made for the most exciting season of the entire four year run.    Unfortunately the exciting new direction couldn't produce ratings and was barely renewed after a fan based letter writing campaign, echoing the classic series fan fueled renewal.    The fourth season of Star Trek Enterprise was the season that most Trekkers have been waiting for, with homage to the original series (Mirror Universe, The Eugenics Wars, Orion slave women, T'Pau), as well as rectifying continuity errors (The Vulcans, The Klingon \\"forehead\\" issue).Unfortunately, the show was cancelled prematurely as the show was becoming what Trekkers been waiting for since \\"Broken Bow\\".    Sensing that the show wasn't going to see a fifth season, Executive producer Berman handed the reins to Coto, who set about in correcting the many elements in Trek history that have been disregarded, which driven away even the most dedicated fan.    The season's format was tweaked to make room for multi episode arcs which dealt separately with The Eugenics Wars (The Augment trilogy featuring Brent Spiner as Arik Soong), A Vulcan Civil War (featuring Surak, and T'Pau), A Klingon Virus (resulting in the humanoid Klingon foreheads from the original series), and the mirror universe featuring the USS Defiant from The Tholian Web.    One of the biggest disappointments of the season itself was the final episode \\"...These Are The Voyages\\" which takes place on the Enterprise-D, featuring Riker and Troi reviewing the NX-01's final mission before the charter signing of the UFP.Instead of giving the NX-01 crew a dignified send off,they were used as supporting characters in a glorified \\"Next Generation\\" episode.    Unfortunately, Enterprise would be a troubled production whereas the declining interest of Trek, flawed stories of the earlier seasons, and bad ratings would lead to its cancellation. The finale (written by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga) was called a \\"Valentine to the fans\\". But the real valentine was the entire fourth season which finally gave the fans what they wanted, and the most problematic Star Trek series a dignified ending, despite its weak finale.    Top five episodes    1.Dead Stop (season two)     2.Impulse (Season Three)     3.Dear Doctor (Season one)     4.Cogenetor (Season Two)     5.Damage (Season Three)

B000M5AJQS|4.0|Let's get this clear from the start. No matter what Scorsese says about being 'inspired' by Infernal Affairs (the original Hong Kong hit movie) and what writer Monahan says about the original work he put into 'researching' the script, this is simply a REMAKE. The plot, the scenes, the characters ... everything has been basically lifted from the original. The phone calls, the cinema scene, the taking of names by the Tsang/Nicholson character, the envelope with the corrected writing, the rooftop climax, the shooting of the Leung/DiCaprio character ... all these scenes and more have simply been carbon copied into The Departed. Even the expressions, pace, camera angles and other details have been faithfully reporduced. In an ironic reversal of roles, Hollywood is now doing the pirating of Asian movies now. So if you have watched and enjoyed Infernal Affairs (IA), what you have to ask yourself before paying to buy this DVD of The Departed (TD) is: Is TD any different from IA? Do the differences make TD better than IA? Are the differences great enough to justify my splashing cash on a flagrant copy of IA? <br /> <br />So what are the differences between the two movies? Here's some of the more important ones: <br /> <br />1. Jack Nicholson gets a HUGE expansion of his role (orginally Eric Tsang's in IA). This is where Monahan did his homework, fleshing out the role of this evil gangster with real-life Boston underworld details. Whereas Tsang had a relatively secondary role supporting the two younger leads, Monahan and Scorsese turn Nicholson's character into arguably the central pivot of their movie. Nicholson delivers a fantastic performance, creating one of the most memorable bad guys of the last 10 years. It is tempting to say that ol' Jack's virtuoso display alone is worth the price of the DVD. But IMHO this overly strong performance actually comes very close to overshadowing the entire theme of the story. The success of the original IA was the fine balance between the2 sides: Tony Leung & Anthony Wong (DiCaprio & Sheen) pitting wits against Andy Lau & Eric Tsang (Damon & Nicholson). This edgy and closely-matched battle was critical to the genius of the story. Nicholson's scene-stealing is eminently watchable but undermimes the central Damon-DiCaprio battle. Damon is in many ways reduced to Nicholson's stooge. This is a shame because both Damon and DiCaprio deliver truly great performances of their own which would already have carried the movie well. <br /> <br />2. The setting is changed from Hong Kong to Boston. This is done flawlessly. The basic story of IA was sufficiently brilliant enough to allow transposition to New England without any hint of awkwardness. Here, Scorsese works brilliantly with the script and actors to give a convincing Bostonian feel to the movie. The accents are natural enough, the settings feel right, and the details put the audience right in the heart of Boston (such as the rugby games etc). The first 1/3 of TD, where the characters of DiCaprio and Damon's characters are being fleshed out are easily its greatest area of improvement over IA. <br /> <br />3. TD adds the dimension of a love triangle evolving between Damon, DiCaprio and the psychiatrist. At first, this feels so contrived. Yeah right, so in a large city like Boston it just so happens that these two moles are stalking each other ... but they also just happen to go for the same woman?! Gimme a break. But after watching TD, it actually works OK. In IA, the psychiatrist (Kelly Chen) only acts as a foil to allow Tony Leung to verbalize his internal conflict as an undercover agent. Sammi Cheng's role as Andy Lau's love interest is even more redundant and sticks out like a sore thumb. Combining these two female roles into one actually serves to reduce their irrelevancy in this mainly male movie. The only downside is that the scene where Tony Leung comes across his ex-girlfriend and the daughter he never knew he had is gone from TD. That is a terrible shame: it was easily one of the most poignant and emotional moments in both movies - and a candidate for Top 100 Best Moments in movie history. <br /> <br />4. Mark Wahlberg's character is superfluous. Yes, he delivers a probably career-best performance - but the character really is completely non-essential. It is as though Scorsese and Monahan realized they stacked the hand of the gangsters excessively with Nicholson on that side - and decided to add Wahlberg to Sheen on the Police side to balance things out a bit. It doesn't work. Anthony Wong's strong display on IA confirms this: properly acted out, his character is the mirror image and equal of Eric Tsang's. Adding a Wahlberg cannot compensate for the dominating presence of Nicholson on the gangster side and imbalances the movie a little. Having Wahlberg delivering the final murderous twist at the end also feels excessively contrived and introduces last-minute questions of logicality that spoil the ending. <br /> <br />5. Monahan's script tries to be clever by providing extra detail on the main 'crime' perpetrated by Nicholson's gang: the smuggling of some fancy military micro-chips. But this is clumsily done and again serves to distract more than add to the story.  <br /> <br />6. In both movies, one of the gangsters finds out about Leung/DiCaprio's real identity just before dying. IA does a far better job of explaining why he didn't give up this secret. In TD, it seems so illogical why this hood didn't expose DiCaprio earlier. <br /> <br />7. In IA, the Andy Lau character is shown to be more of a master of his own destiny. He is cool and calculating, and he is the one who consciously makes the decision that he no longer wants to be a gangster - and then plots to make the switch sacrificing friends, mentors and collegaues ruthlessly in order to do so. In the end, he is prevented from completing his switch back to the side of Light by the second mole planted by the gangsters into the Police unit. He is therefore fated to live on in this purgatory existence - as opposed to Leung who dies but finally is allowed back his true identity and honor after death. Whose fate is worse? In TD, Damon's role is made much more simple-minded. His character is reactive, not proactive - having his hand forced by circumstances more. His desire to switch from Dark to Light is less obvious, even when he delivers the 'clean slate' monologue to his girlfriend. It seems that in TD, Damon is forced to suurender the main Gangster role opposite Leung's main Cop role to Nicholson. Instead of Lau vs Leung, we get Nicholson vs DiCaprio with Damon being nudged aside to a more subservient role. <br /> <br />8. Much is being said about the excellent acting throughout TD. This is undeniable. Besides ol' Jack, DiCaprio really gives one of the best acting performances of the year. He is truly wonderful to watch and convinces us with his torment and suffering. But as good as he is, one could argue that Tony Leung was marginally better. What DiCaprio delivered with his face, Leung delivered with his eyes alone. Tony Leung is widely considered to be one of the best actors of all time from Asia. Sadly, Hollywood seems uninterested in oriental actors who are not sexy nymphs (like Ziyi Zhang), kung fu superstars (like Jackie & Jet), or wizards at posing with guns (like Chow Yun Fat). Those who are even vaguely familiar with Asian movies will know that the ensemble of Lau/Leung/Tsang/Wong is easily the Hong Kong equivalent in terms of star power and acting ability to Hollywood's Damon/DiCaprio/Nicholson/Sheen. All four Hong Kong leads were Best Actor award winners at least once in Asian film circles. The only area where the acting in TD pulls away from IA is probably in the minor roles. Alec Baldwin gives a wonderfully steely, hard-edged core beneath the misleading fat buffoon-like exterior - far superior to the purely comic Hong Kong equivalent. As said above, both female leads in IA were annoyingly redundant(and accordingly poorly acted by trendy pop songstresses rather than proper actresses) but the psychiatrist in TD is sympathetically rendered as a flesh-and-blood person.  <br /> <br />So the conclusion?  <br /> <br />In the end, I still would prefer IA over TD. The story is much better told with a beautifully crafted balance of characters and wits on both sides. The emotions and conflicts of the two key protagonists are better portrayed and much more convincing. The story (surely a modern classic) is allowed to drive a powerful movie in IA, rather than serve as a Marty Scorsese bloodfest or a Jack Nicholson star vehicle. <br /> <br />But does that mean TD is not worth buying/watching? Far from it!! TD falls marginally flat only when compared to its stellar parent from Hong Kong. In its own right, it is a wonderfully acted and directed movie, with great chracter developments - especially in the early part of the film. For those who have not watched IA (or can't be bothered to read subtitles), TD easily represents one of the best movies of 2006 and one of the best ever crime movies from Hollywood. It is arguably even better than Goodfellas in terms of character development and entertainment value. Even for fans of IA, the differences between IA and TD are sufficently interesing enough for one to momentarily overlook the obvious plagiaristic elements and enjoy the experience. Watching TD for the 1st two times is probably more entertaining than re-watching IA for the umpteenth time for most people. <br /> <br />I would not be surprised to see The Departed win Best Film Oscar this year. Maybe Scorsese will finally win his Best Director Oscar. But it would be a shame that while he never won for his many original classics, he may now win for a blatant copy of a foreign movie - with even most of the clever directorial flourishes also reproduced exactly verbatim from Internal Affairs. If Scorsese did win Best Director, he owes the original directors of Internal Affairs a share of the statue.

B00004TJKI|5.0|This is a great, great, classic American film, in the truest Hollywood sense, a stand up film that holds up generations later. Combining excellence from all aspects of the production, it's relevence as a story-both in sheer fundamental formalism and subjective psychological, legal realism-emphasizes it's essential artistry.   The appeal of a show like Law & Order lies in it's unification of the formula and the particular circumstances of that week, impelling our complex society as a mirror unto itself, and a film like Anatomy of a Murder succeeds in this and by drawing itself in shades of gray under cloudy skies against the rigors of law.   James Stewart, Lee Remick, George C. Scott and Joseph N. Welch are great here. Great performances that propell the murder trial of an Army Lieutenant who killed a bar owner who the Lieutenant's wife (Remick) says raped and beat her. That's all I feel is necessary to say about the plot. See this for it's technical and envigorating fleshing out of the tale, executed beautifully.   I knew in the first eight minutes that this was a classic, (the legendary Saul Bass' title sequence almost guaranteed it.) Whether the performances, the cinematography, the amazing score by Duke Ellington (who makes a cameo as a band leader, Pie Eye), the crisp courtroom dialogue, in particular between Stewart and Scott, or Remick's ambiguous tramp/femme fatale....  A note of note: Joseph N. Welch, who is terrific as the out-of-town judge, was the lawyer for the Army during the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954, particularly famous for rebuking Senator McCarthy; \\"Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\\"  Five years after that, what with the maniacal onus of Otto Preminger, a film like this illuminated the significance of law, as the site where the infintely complicated lives of individuals are wrung through the system we've established to buffer ourselves as we progress into the abyss.

B000GCFO0I|2.0|Anyone familiar with the Silent Hill video games knows that Konami's horror franchise manages to pack in an awesomely eerie atmosphere with a somewhat lacking storyline.  While that isn't such a bad thing in the video game world, when it comes to film, well, that's not really a good combination.  Christophe Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf) directs the film adaptation of Silent Hill with Roger Avary (Pulp Fiction, Rules of Attraction) screenwriting, and the film is a faithful interpretation of the game series, but that's not always a good thing as we soon learn.  Radha Mitchell (Man on Fire, Pitch Black) plays a desperate mother searching for her missing daughter in the ghost town of Silent Hill, and wouldn't you know it that all kinds of ultra creepy things start happening?  Sean Bean plays her clueless husband searching for her whereabouts outside the town, and Deborah Kara Unger and Alice Krige are along for the ride as well, but they are clearly having more fun relishing in just how laughable this film is.  That being said, though the film's storyline is practically incomprehensible, the look of the film under Gans' incredibly stylish direction really is a sight to behold.  The CGI effects and makeup work are very well done as well, which is a shame because had Avery maybe added a little more to the story, Silent Hill could have been something special besides being another lame video game to film adaptation (but at least this didn't get stuck with Uwe Boll).  That being said, Silent Hill is worth seeing for it's ultra stylistic look and feel, but that's pretty much it.
B000FIMG68|1.0|Too many things on this second series make this series weak. <br />Some make it riduculous, with all due respect, the famous hatch, has a main entrance? <br />What is the point then for having a 90 feet hole with a bullet proof glass when there is another entrance. <br />During the show the 2 main characters start fighting over who is better? This is on a desert island where they are trying to survive? <br />The jungle from episode one had some sort of \\"invisible dinosaur\\" walking around and then what happens to it? Does he goe to sleep for 2 years? <br />I honestly think that this tv show could have been great but instead it really makes \\"Buffy the vampire slayer\\" like an intellectual scientific show.

1400079276|3.0|Kafka on the Shore was my first Murakami story.   I must say that it was somewhat of a split experience.  The storyline was pleasant, especially in the first half, though weaker in the second.  I found myself much more interested in the sub-characters, Oshima as well as Nakata and Hoshino, than the 15 year old, central figure, Kafka.    The story supposedly takes place in Japan.  However, multiple instances of American food, music, dialogue and other western cultural cues kept giving me the impression that the characters were not situated in Japan, but, were conducting their lives in some remote part of California.   The author attempts to mix narrative styles, but this didn't work for me, and I would have preferred that he would have stayed with a third person narrative.  The split, first person narrative, made Kafka's musings and reflections, sound like the content that one would read in a 14-16 year old boy's Myspace blog.     <br /> <br />I really didn't tire of Nakata and looked forward to his predicaments.  His magical umbrella, his dialogue with cats, his quest to open and close mystical doors kept the story moving along.   His friend, Hoshino's, personal growth was much more evident than Kafka's (though I expected the reverse).  The notion that an \\"empty\\" person can so effectively calm and heal another's troubled soul was also intriguing.     Late in the story, I was lured into thinking that I must fear for Kafka's welfare (although the lurid, evil characters that I imagined would emerge never materialized).   I was prompted to laugh at the end of the novel, imagining that if I were a cat, advising Hoshino on appropriate weaponry for killing the evil presence, that I'd strongly recommend a 10% solution of benzoyl peroxide.  Those of you who have read the book need only consider the metaphorical comparison between the problem and the solution. <br /> <br />I might give this author another try, but I would aim for his best book as a starting point. <br />

0790730960|1.0|Unfortunately I wasnt a kid when this film first came out ,So have no nostalgic feeling for it.   I came out of the comics back when Neal Adams brought back the darker,brooding Batman from what he had become after the TV show made him more of a silly \\"camp\\" cartoon clown. I mean ,I like Adam West...in a sort of William Shatner kind of way, but the show was always about the punchline.     so when the Batman movies did come along, I was waiting for more of a Neal Adams, acrobatic and vengeful Batman ...but was pretty dissappointed when they returned with a perhaps darker , but more drawing on the TV show Batman once again. So I only saw Batman and Batman Returns once, when they initially came out.    anyway, Last night \\"Returns\\" was on TV and I decided I better give it another chance to see what all the hoopla was about. ...and I still can't see it.  Yes Michelle is very Hot in her costume and her story was a bit more complex than I remembered, in fact the movie seems to revolve around her... which I guess is a positive, but it just wasnt enough to keep it from being the campy Burton film it is.   I'm just not getting where the \\"Dark,Moody and brooding\\" stuff is coming from. The whole night time lighting of the rooftop scenes actually reminds me more of The Chimney sweep dancing scene in Mary Poppins .Dont get me wrong, I thought Mary Poppins was very well done, But for the Creature of the night Batman is supposed to be...ok maybe hes not supposed to be, but I thought he was supposed to be...  this was just a bit to crisp,clear and bright. the camera work in the fight scenes and the fights themselves,  I wanted to be more amazing aswell. not this posing,punching, hold the camera still for the running backflips then back into stiff fighting poses.  Batman should be almost faster than you can see in his movements, So should Catwoman, Not out there posing!  the Penguin? geez, yeah, he's pretty grotesque.he's got penguins with rocket backpacks running around and a lot ofpeople get killed in the movie, but I'm just dont get sucked into this movie. Its just too campy for me.     But if you want you Batman that way, then hey this is a pretty good film,I guess.  But I much prefer the more recent Batman Begins. for me, That one finally got it right.
B000M4RG42|3.0|Like many of the previous reviewers, I was expecting to love 'Flags of Our Fathers.' I loved 'Saving Private Ryan' and am fascinated with virtually all things concerning WWII. And while I did find Flags to be relatively moving, I was also disappointed. Firstly, I do think the battle scenes were well done and the realism of war comes off just about as good as 'Saving Private Ryan.' But SPR this is not. Where SPR was unabashedly patriotic(which I have no problem with) Flags is a far more cynical look at the war. It not-so-subtly highlights the use of American propaganda (in the form of that famous picture) to raise money and moral support for the war effort. While this in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing, it is portrayed as a somewhat callous and superficial campaign that often brushes aside the very soldiers that bear the brunt of the sacrifice.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewers that the film was a bit disconnected in some places and that there is a lack of character development. With the exception of Ira Hayes, all of the characters are just kind of there, and we don't really get to know anything about them. This includes Ryan Phillippe's character, John \\"Doc\\" Bradley, who's son wrote the book and for all intents and purposes is the lead character. This is my main criticism of the film. While Eastwood seems to shun the gung-ho patriotism of the collective in favor of showing the personal toll on the individual soldier, he fails to develop any individuality in the soldiers. So needless to say, the film did not have the desired effect. With that said, I did find the ending to be somewhat moving and I feel that this was an honorable attempt at a tribute to our fallen soldiers.<br /><br />Incidentally, I have come to agree with Eastwood's cynicism regarding our country's treatment of our soldiers. One of things in the film that particularly struck me was how blatantly these soldiers were used and then virtually thrown away as soon as they were no longer needed. One of the more compelling scenes that portrayed this was the one where Private Gagnon can't find a job other than as a janitor after the war. Contrast this to the scene during their fund-raising tour where every businessman in sight was offering \\"the hero\\" a job. Not to mention the heart-breaking story of Ira Hayes. Many reviewers have critisized this aspect of the film as being too preachy, and while I agree it could have been a little more subtle, I think it is hard to argue that the premise is not essentially true. So while I think that 'Flags of our Fathers' ultimately came up a bit short overall, I think it's heart was in the right place. 3.5 stars.ne of the more compelling scenes that portrayed this was the one where Private Gagnon can't find a job other than as a janitor after the war.

B000ASATWQ|5.0|I love this CD.  The high energy of Damian Marley is sooo much like his father Bob Marley. The touching haunting melodic song \\"There For You\\" just grabs your heart.  Damian Marley's \\"Move\\", with his father's song \\"Exodus\\" intertwined throughout is fantastic. You want to jump up and start dancing. His theme song \\"Welcome To Jamrock\\", when I first heard it I loved it and is what drew me to purchase this CD.  If you love the Jamaican sound, in my opinion you must add this CD to your collection. New school and old school blended together sooo beautifully.
1400064287|1.0|Depending what you are trying to get out of the book, this book didn't do it for ME. <br /> <br />I own a 15 year old Public Relations Firm as marketing and sales knowledge is critical. I purchased the book based on the great reviews and couldn't understand why? <br /> <br />For a book that espouses \\"stickiness\\", it was a hard read. I had to force myself to read each chapter.  <br /> <br />One example is an analogy of trying to explain a \\"Pomelo\\", which is a sort-of fruit, well you can say it's like a grapefruit, sort of. <br />Quick Question: If you mixed pomelo juice with orange juice would it taste good? You might make a guess. But you must put a \\"flag\\" on it and tell people that a pomelo is \\"like\\" a grapefruit, you call up a mental image of a grapefruit. So, if you ask me what a Pomelo is i would tell you \\"it's like a grapefruit\\"(Now you know what a Pomelo is like). Wow, this is cutting edge, isn't it?  <br /> <br />Is this a sick joke? This Pomelo story rambles and rambles until you feel like your reading what you kindergarden children are reading. <br /> <br />The above-mentioned is the type of mindless rambling that this book reads like. If your into this type of psyco-babble, this book is for you. If you value your precious time, stay away, far away.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for great sales and marketing books, this is not it. There are many great (obscure) books on the market that will help you sell and market effectively which i would like to recommend but that wouldn't be fair to the authors of this mind numbing book. It was my mistake for buying it.   <br /> <br />I know it looks like this review is a contrarian attack, but i really wanted to like this book. My apologies to the authors.

If your interested in this type of stuff, be sure to check out a movie called \\"What the Bleep Do We Know?\\" Great stuff!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I've watched pretty much all different versions of Jane Eyre movies out there.  I have to say this is the one version where I love both Mr. Rochester and Jane.  The best acting has to go to Ruth Wilson as Jane, this is where she presents a mature, calm, serene, very confident female, and Toby is just wonderful, handsome and extremely manly to watch with a sense of humour and sarcasm.  I also love the older BBC version with Timothy Dalton, but this current version just makes me feel incredibly happy and optimistic with love and life, it makes me re-read the book and just fall in love with this story all over again.   <br />I strongly recommend all Jane Eyre lovers out there to try out different versions and decide for yourself.  Me, I love this one version the most.  My only complaint: it's a little too short.  In the book, Mr. Rochester tells Jane how he fell in love with her the first time they met, how he observed her, how he went extra length to make her jealous to make sure that Jane is in love with him as much as he's madly in love with her.  Although this movie doesn't have that part, but I'm happy with it so far.
B000GIXIBY|4.0|This HD DVD represents the best video presentation of the film thus far. The previous Universal and (mutiple) Anchor Bay DVDs just can't match the fine detail and color production of this edition. Even the standard DVD side is a  noticable improvement over the other DVDs. The biggest difference (aside from the advantages of HD) is that this edition features the film's intended coloration. The Anchor Bay DVDs have an ugly greyish-blue tint and are heavily filtered with digital noise reduction techniques.   <br /> <br />Sure, this HD DVD is only the 81 theatrical version, but not only does it beat the Anchor Bay theatrical version DVDs, it destroys the Anchor Bay director's cut DVDs. The DC DVDs look like a 9th generation bootleg VHS, Anchor Bay should be ashamed of themselves. On a sidenote if you want the best DC presentation on DVD, track down the region 3 Hong Kong DVD released by MGM. It's 96 minutes and perfect, the longest cut anywhere, and will make you feel cheated you ever invested in the unwatchable Anchor Bay DC editions to begin.    <br /> <br />Also this HD DVD/DVD Combo only has the film's theatrical trailer, but what can you expect when Universal never created supplemental features for the film. All that was Anchor Bay's doing. Sure, it kinda sucks it's so bareboned, but there is a rational explaination as to why.                    <br /> <br />So in short, this HD DVD/Combo Combo is a worthy purchase for any ED fan.
B00005JPAM|5.0|The Queen starts out unambitiously enough. Elizabeth II, Queen of England, meeting the newly-elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, a young up-and-comer who is determined to shake things up a bit in government. Elizabeth assures Blair, through her ceremony, forms, and observation that she has survived ten Prime Ministers (her own education in such relations starting with none other than Winston Churchill), that she will not be shaken up. That it is the young-buck Blair who has everything to learn, and not the stolid, stoic Queen. <br /> <br />Of course, Elizabeth was raised in a different time and age. Ensconced in various palaces, she rarely gets the opportunity to see what the realm she ironically leads, is like. When her ex-daughter-in-law, the popular Diana, tragically dies in an auto accident, Elizabeth has no conception of what a storm it will set off, both in Britain and the world. She has no *ability* to conceive of it, either: she believes that death is a private affair, and that England is a country of people who are as private and guarded as is she. On top of that, she personally bears Diana no particular goodwill, and so Elizabeth decides to treat Diana's death as a non-event. <br /> <br />But the British people--a different British people than Elizabeth imagines--demands a response. Demands a human, feeling monarchy. Blair, the new man of the people, represents this to the Queen, and so we are introduced to a struggle of wills between the old, controlled, powerful Queen, and the new face of Blair. It is also a struggle, more generally, between tradition and change. If you know what normally wins that struggle, or you remember these particular events in your own lifetime, then you know which side wins. <br /> <br />Elizabeth is presented an impossible choice: change and relent, or the monarchy, itself, will crack. It is a wonderfully dramatic scenario, and thrilling to watch it portrayed by such a talented, capable actress. Mirren will win the Best ActressOscar, and she will deserve it. <br /> <br />It is also fun to watch other famous characters, such as Blair and Prince Charles, portrayed. It's hard to not like Blair in this film (as he eventually comes around to respect the monarchy he once found silly and dated), and hard not to feel sorry for him in his own, more recent, fall from popular approval. Prince Charles is another matter all-together: it is moving to watch him grieve for Diana, and painful to watch how this man (the would-be King of England) is so bowed over and controlled by others in his life. Despite the fact that the Queen is the centerpiece, the others are all interesting character studies in their own right. <br /> <br />It is rare to have a historical film about events so recent, revolving around people still living and capable (and, in fact, still in power). It's nice to be given this sort of insight into the people we still see on the news, to be able to reconsider our once-held notions of them, instead of waiting until they're long-dead to reflect. The Queen provides us with this rare opportunity, and it does so in an entertaining and brilliantly acted way. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br />Five stars. <br />
B0002KQNJU|3.0|The Fearless Vampire Killers (aka Dance of the Vampires) is one of those films that always feels too broad and clumsily played to work half as well as it should despite some great ideas - gay vampires, Jewish vampires, even a Richard III vampire - and some gorgeous production design and photography of the snow-covered locations. Aside from Polanski's love of the grotesque, all too often he uses a sledgehammer to crack a nut, telegraphing jokes and egging on some of the performers (Jack MacGowran, Alfie Bass) way beyond the point of caricature while others (Polanski himself as the juvenile lead, Ferdy Mayne as the vampire count) get more with less. But there are enough moments, such as the dance of the vampires, to make it worth watching, and it does have one of the great lines in vampire cinema when Alfie Bass is confronted with a crucifix: \\"Oy, have you got da wrong vampire!\\" It also has one of the most curious but strangely effective pieces of dubbing, with the count's son trying to seduce Polanski with Vladek Sheybal's dulcet tones...<br /><br />The DVD boasts the uncut version of the film in a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer and also comes with the original trailer (\\"Two men on a vampire hunt. Simple. They certainly are!\\") and a ten-minute Scope featurette starring Max Wall as a vampire expert giving the audience a primer for the film. It's not even remotely funny, but it is an intriguing curio.
B00009AOBI|1.0|I liked it so much better when Eric Stoltz lived with that other family and decided to shack up with his tomboy drummer next-door neighbor chick with the new wave hairdo and duds, and tight little body. He turned down the annoying, future homemaker-looking Mrs. Popularity in the process. Amazing! Damn, it looks like Eric got stung in the face by a wild pack of bees for hours and then had his head stretched on a rack after being taken in by his new foster mom and biker gang. Don't worry, these are the same bikers as the ones who deliver cute little stuffed animals to kids with leukemia, so it's all good. Not! Later, if you'll remember, Eric devolves into a drug addict bank robber in Paris and eventually earns a living selling drugs to folks like Vincent Vega, an inane, puffy-faced and high-ranking Scientology official. So I guess you can at least partly blame Eric for \\"Battlefield Earth.\\"
0743298020|4.0|This is a page turner novel. While I was reading it, I felt as if I was in a cozy room with a blazing fire in the fireplace and lots of comfy chairs. Snow is falling outside.  The novel had the feel of something written many, many years ago. There is incest and murder in the story. At the end there is a happy ending or maybe it is better to say the possibility of future happiness.  The ending is not a downer.  <br />     A young woman is hired to write a biography of a famous reclusive writer. The writer's biography is the basis of the story, but there are other things going on. Almost all  the mysteries in the novel are solved. <br />This is a very entertaining book and a good one for a book discussion.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|As my fiancee and I were leaving the theater, we heard a discussion in front of us about the film:    \\"But why 'Babel'? What does that mean?\\" asked the wife (I presume).    \\"You know... babble... with two 'b's.\\" replied the husband (and again).    Well, almost.    As you probably know, the title of this film refers to the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel. According to that story, there was once a time when mankind was united in language, in country and in purpose. And, at that time, man decided to build a great city and a great Tower that could reach on to Heaven, itself. God, horrified at the prospect of man being able to do anything that he set his mind to (yeah, that's the rationale given...), decided to make such cooperation impossible, then and in the future, by dividing man into the several nations and tongues. We were given different languages so that we couldn't communicate clearly with each other; so that we would be divided amongst ourselves, and could no longer cooperate to reach for the sky (and attaining the sky is only possible through cooperation).    Babel is, in part, an exploration of how good a job God did.    Each of the four stories of Babel (a family of Moroccan goat-herders; the couple they accidentally shoot at; the couple's children and housekeeper in San Diego; a Japanese businessman and his deaf-mute daughter) revolves in some way around communication or culture, and how our difficulties and differences stand in our way.    That such communication and superficial differences might be our only *real* barriers is presented subtly, yet well, by providing us with scenes and themes in each locale which are universally human: the two Moroccan brothers tussling for dominance; the Japanese teen's struggle for acceptance and understanding; the joy and celebration of family and love in Mexico; and, the powerful intimacy between loved-ones, when death might be approaching. These people are all human, and their struggles and triumphs are familiar.In showing us these scenes, we learn to see past the subtitles and languages to the people behind them. We see that, whatever confusion God may have wrought might yet be undone, if only we were better able to understand one another.    This movie strikes one blow against God's project, in helping us to better understand each other, and in that (and several other aspects others will touch on, such as direction, acting, excitement, etc.), the movie is a great success.    Five stars.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|This is an unbelievably fantastic film!  This film is really what movies were meant to be (but often fail to live up to such expectations).  The movie is a genuine and timely portrayal of the human spirit to fall in love with the right person, regardless of where that other person falls within the socioeconomic sphere.  Love is far deeper than status and riches.  In the film, the story is centered quite strongly on the concepts of mysticism, but also, the issue of how far one is willing to go in order to be with the best possible person.  This is a movie not to be missed!  WATCH IT TONIGHT!
B000BYA5GO|1.0|Nothing more than a retelling of the Merry Melodies classic, \\"The High and the Flighty.\\" In the 1956 toon, Daffy Duck sells torture devices to both Barnyard Dog and Foghorn Leghorn who have drawn the lines as if battling over territory -- or perhaps just intentionally aggravating one another -- in the manner of the \\"Lord of War\\"-friendly Israelis and Palestinians (even so direct as Foghorn uttering the line, \\"This, I say, this calls for massive retaliation,\\" after getting hit in the head with a watermelon). Except that in the cartoon, the two warring parties eventually unite against the \\"Lord of War.\\" Cartoon director Robert McKimson presents a much more optimistic view on humanity. Nicolas Cage should be ashamed that he signed on for such an unoriginal and weak-spirited project.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyd, in my humble opinion, has achieved a level of sonic and spatial sophistication and brilliance that continues to prove timeless and without peers.  \\"Pulse\\" is the crowning achievement for a threesome that clearly understood the fact that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and, regardless of one's maniacal and mispercieved sense of self importance, had conviction that the name and the music must go on.  For that, we are all direct beneficiaries and I, for one, want to say \\"thank you\\" for soldiering on..... <br /> <br />My favorite part of the disc, you ask?  It's during the first minute of \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" when David looks over at Richard and smiles while working his slide guitar soon followed by Richard looking over at David and smiling as he manipulates a classic jazz chord on his piano.  Physically, their positions on the stage couldn't be further apart.  Spiritually, they're as connected on this disc as when they first came together. <br /> <br />A wise philosopher once said that, truly, one has no idea of what they have until it's gone.  Fortunately for us, Pink Floyd is alive and kicking and that, in my book, gives hope that they'll one day soon bless us with another live masterpiece.  If only for one evening, it will be a night not soon forgotten..... <br />
B000EGDB10|4.0|Many of the special effects are classics in their genre, and seem somewhat cliched after being copied (or improved) by numerous other films.  Tom Cruise was still a credible actor when he did MI-1.  Something weird happened to him on the way to the top, but when he did Mission Impossible 1, it hadn't occurred yet.  The plot is typical cloak-and-dagger stuff, with a few twists, updated for the early computer age.  The technical quality of the DVD is excellent, and the movie is very entertaining, even if you barely recall the storyline a week later.  If you like action movies, you NEED this one!
B000BTJDGC|4.0|\\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" was a great surprise for me.  Based on a true event, I was expecting a horror movie like \\"The Exorcist\\", but actually it is a great story of trial, with the confrontation of science and religion, but with an agnostic lawyer defending and a religious one accusing a priest.<br /><br />It is the horror plot and the plight of Emily Rose which engages the audience most though. Her story is told in a series of flashbacks that are never disjointed or abstract. It is the realism of her tragic story that is the most frightening thing in the film. It may even make you curious to read up on the true case the film is based upon.<br /><br />My only criticism would be that promising sub-plots end up going nowhere. Don't let this put you off though. \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is that most rare of things. A good, contemporary horror film.

IT WOULD BE A SHAME NOT TO HAVE THIS GREAT WORK OF ART.  HER VOICE IS AT ITS VERY BEST.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Sure, it's a fantasy, but so what?!  Sandra and Keanu give emotional, well-acted performances which will get to you.  It is easily my favorite movie of the last year.  If you're ready for a plot-driven movie instead of car chases and explosions, and if you don't mind keeping a Kleenex box handy, you will LOVE The Lake House.  Recommended!
B000AYELVU|5.0|This movie has the best opening scene ever!  It's amazing how great they made this movie considering the first one was only eh... <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
0061122416|3.0|I can see why The Alchemist has appealed to a lot of people.  The book is basically one positive message, conveyed with New Age language and seasoned with Jewish/Mormon mythology.  But, while the book's message is sound, I found the writing to be weak.  I understand that Coelho was trying to write a modern fairy tale, and thus was keeping the writing simple so that the words wouldn't interfere with the point.  However, instead of finding the writing elegant in its simplicity, I found it cloying.  That quality, along with the near-complete lack of depth for any of the book's characters, resulted in Coelho achieving what he tried to avoid:  have his writing detract from his message. <br /> <br />The Alchemist is an \\"okay\\" book, which would probably be valuable to anyone who hasn't heard its lesson in other forms.  But, those interested in that lesson should probably seek out other works that convey this point more eloquently.
B00005MP58|1.0|They covered all the basic plot points but I think the movie lost something in so doing.  Trying to cram everything into two hours left me scratching my head.  I'd have to say if you don't read the book and you watched this movie you might not understand everything that was happening.  All in all i wouldn't buy this flick.
B00092ZL80|5.0|This DVD is excellent because it shows two distinct styles of music getting along.  It also shows a variety of instruments that can reinforce the students' identification skills.  Plus the music is fun to listen too.  I usually only show one or two songs at a time.  It also shows how bad it looks (at least from my point of view) to be chewing gum on stage. <br /> <br />
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I've had this sweeper for about 6 months. I haven't had any problems with the battery or the handle. I've seen complaints about both in reviews. This product does not replace a vacumn or good old fashion broom and mop. Its a great quick pick up. The handle and pole are not made of the strongest material but anything else would make this product heavy and cumbersome. With normal use neither the handle or pole should present a problem. I have two cats and this works wonders to do quick pickups of the kibble bits by their food bowl. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a product for quick sprucing. The product does not replace general cleaning with a vacumn.       Edit: Shortly after writing this review this unit stopped working and was thrown in the trash. It has since been replaced with something different that has outlasted it. This is too expensive to need replacing in so short of time. Amazon won't let me reduce the stars I'd give this a 2 1/2
039472903X|5.0|Why reinvent the wheel when you have the soundest principles in advertising at your fingertips?  Although Ogilvy's book is almost 25 years old, it's jam packed with timely instruction, insight, and examples. Or perhaps because it is 25 years old.  Ogilvy quotes colleague Bill Bernbach:<br /><br />\\"It is fashionable to talk about changing man.  A communicator must be concerned with unchanging man ... The creative man with an insight into human nature, with the artistry to touch and move people will succeed. Without them he will fail.\\"<br /><br />Ogilvy had insight in spades, practical experience, common sense, a passion for research as well as creativity, and above all, a relentless focus on selling. Pick any few paragraphs at random and all those qualities will shine through. Among the many ideas I found really helpful--<br /><br />1. Branding means giving your product personality. (For example, the man in the Hathaway shirt wore an eyepatch.)<br /><br />2. Facts sell better than hype.<br /><br />3. The principles of direct response apply to all forms of advertising.<br /><br />4. Creativity is worthless unless it sells.<br /><br />5. Copywriting is the heart of advertising.<br /><br />6. Use the brand name in your headline. Otherwise 80% of readers may never see it.<br /><br />7. Long copy sells.<br /><br />8. Analogies, big words, and naming the competitor confuse people.<br /><br />9. Pricing cannot be determined scientifically.<br /><br />10. Excellent graphic design is simple graphic design.<br /><br />11. Corporate advertising is worthwhile.<br /><br />12. Always include a promise in your headline.<br /><br />13. The era of the blockbuster brand is ending.  (Ogivly detected the \\"Long Tail\\" 20 years before most of us!)<br /><br />14. According to Ogivly, \\"...advertising is no more and no less than a reasonably efficient way to sell.\\"<br /><br />But this summary doesn't do the book justice.  He makes solid points nonstop.  Not surprising for a master copywriter and former door-to-door salesman, he writes in plain English.  He offers \\"big picture\\" reflections on the advertising industry, including an impassioned defense of advertising against charges of hucksterism.  He offers detailed tips that are just as important, mainly on print advertising, direct response, and dealing with clients.<br /><br />Educational, authoritative, fun to read.  A+nglish.

1552091090|5.0|Come on people, get real.  These negative comments are, well, strange.  Talk about reading too much into a book.  This isn't a masterpeice of fine literature, but a cute little story about a mother's love for a child and a child's love for their parent.   I mean really, should we read Winnie the Pooh or Barney and take it literally as some have taken the mother 'sneaking into her son's house'   This book is really not so much a children's book as it is a book for parents.  As any parent knows, your love is undying and you will do anything for kids.  Take the book at face value and don't let some of the comments that are, really kind of depraved, deter you from at least taking a look at this book.  You have to wonder if some of the people who made such weird comments about this book didn't know a parent's love when they were growing up themselves.
B00005UEAR|5.0|After seeing Dream Theater 35 times in four countries and owning their entire discography, this is without a doubt my favorite and possibly their best. I'm not one into going through many details, but if you're here as a new fan, take my word for its greatness. My favorite track is one of their five greatest songs ever, \\"Blind Faith\\".<br /><br />\\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" is a brilliant piece of progressive rock and puts Dream Theater in a class with Emerson Lake & Palmer and Yes. When I met Mike Portnoy, he autographed the CD jacket's lyrics page of \\"The Glass Prison\\" and I nearly cried. When I saw them play \\"Six Degrees\\" in its entirety at Radio City Music Hall with an orchestra, I nearly cried once again. For I see something special in Dream Theater that sets them apart from others: their purity and perfection.
0439813786|5.0|No one can really summarize a book any better than the author proper. So what is, \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" anyway? \\"... this is not exactly a novel, and it's not quite a picture book, and it's not really a graphic novel, or a flip book, or a movie, but a combination of all these things.\\" In short, what you have is a book that can't really be lumped into a single genre. With the rising popularity of the graphic novel, authors have been looking at how to let the visual elements of a given story complement the text. Some will weave graphic novel elements in and out, panels on one page, text on another. Others prefer a kind of \\"Captain Underpants\\" melding with cartoonish pictures. And while all these books are fun reads, none of them have ever really had the (for lack of a better word) gravitas you'd find in a classic text-only children's novel. Until now, that is. \\"Hugo Cabret\\" is a risk. A 500+ page book that's told just equally by pictures as it is by text. It is also like nothing you've ever seen before. No other children's book has even come close.<br /><br />Without Hugo Cabret, none of the clocks in the magnificent Paris train station he lives in would work. Though he's only a kid, Hugo tends to the clocks every day. But there's something even more important in the boy's life than gigantic mechanics. Hugo owns a complex automaton, once his father's, that was damaged in a fire and it is his life's goal to make the little machine work again. To do so, he's been stealing small toys from an old shopkeeper in the station. One day the man catches Hugo in the act, and suddenly the two are thrown together. Coincidences, puzzles, lost keys, and a mystery from the past combine in this complex tale of old and new. The story is told with pictures that act out the action and then several pages of text that describe the plot elements. The final effect is like watching a puzzle work itself into clarity.<br /><br />Selznick is juggling so many different elements and inspirations in this book that you honestly expect the result to be a muddle. Okay. So you have a story involving old-timey movie-maker Georges Melies (he's the old shopkeeper) whose image in this book was modeled on children's book author Remy Charlip (also an influence). You have an automaton, the history of automatons, and the history of movies themselves. There are photographs of old films mixed in with some bizarre sketches. Then you throw all of this together and add in a story about a boy, a girl, a one-eyed man, toys, keys, and a train station. Boom! Instant book. The fact that this title ISN'T a mess is downright bizarre.<br /><br />They say that the mark of a good musical depends on how well the songs advance the story's plot. You can't just have your characters burst into song and then act like nothing ever happened. The case could be made too for books like \\"Hugo Cabret\\". If there is a picture in this story, it has a purpose. Nothing here was included on a whim. When the book breaks from word to image, it has to be done just right. It has to feel natural. At one point in \\"Hugo Cabret\\" our hero is nearly trapped by the Station Inspector. The book reads, \\"The Station Inspector saw the bandages and loosened his grip, at which point, like a wild animal, Hugo escaped.\\" What follows is a thirty-six page chase sequence that comes across like a black and white film. And the real star of this show, in the end, is Selznick's art. The man is doing things with mood and lighting that give the book just the right mysterious feel. Selznick's pictures are done, for the most part in graphite with plenty of shading involved. At the same time, he knows how to get the viewer involved in what they are seeing. There are moments where the \\"camera\\" is zooming in on a particular shot and instantly gets your attention. In the book's opening, we begin with a shot of the moon that pulls back and follows young Hugo. Then suddenly, we see Hugo look over his shoulder and the picture hits you hard. We're on the eighteen or nineteenth page and already we're deeply interested in what we're seeing. We want to know more. Hugo does have some magnificent bags under his eyes at times, and he and the old man's granddaughter Isabelle sometimes look rather similar, but on the whole it's hard to find anything wrong with what Selznick has chosen to place in this book.<br /><br />Admittedly, not everything works as smoothly as it might. Selznick has to keep everything in this story moving constantly. Nobody wants to see picture after picture of people just sitting around and talking, after all. So really, the downside to this kind of book is that some degree of characterization and description is lost in favor of plot and theme. The kids in this book go from liking one another, to hating, to liking again in a manner that feels a tad awkward. Motivations are sometimes murky, even if they're explained later down the line.<br /><br />But the allure of this book for kids can't be stressed enough. Selznick is most familiar to children, at this point in time, because of his covers of such Andrew Clements books as \\"Frindle\\" and \\"School Story\\". When kids see a Selznick cover, they know to grab it. Children who like big thick Harry Potter-sized tomes will pluck the multi-colored \\"Hugo Cabret\\" from its shelves without hesitation. Ironically, though, this is a perfect title for reluctant readers. Though the page count will scare off some, those who've been shown the insides will appreciate this unfamiliar form of storytelling. Unlike a graphic novel or a picture book, however, you can't understand \\"Hugo Cabret\\" through pictures alone. You can try, I guess, but you end up with a very different tale from the one Selznick has written. The nice thing is that in spite of all the complicated details and influences at work here, the story itself is straightforward and interesting.<br /><br />Extra kudos for the spine of this title, by the way. Publishing houses too often forget that sometimes the spine of a book is all a customer is ever going to see of a title. And if there were a Best Spine of the Year Award, I think I know who the winner might be. The spine and back are of Hugo's face, lit from the side. Just his left eye and part of his cheek are visible on the spine, with the title, author, and publisher information shoved to the bottom. It's haunting. Does haunting sell? You bet your sweet bippy it does.<br /><br />It's hard to say whether or not this kind of format would work with any other book. Really, it's the fact that so much of \\"Hugo Cabret\\"'s plot revolves around black and white movies that allows this book to jump so easily between image and text. If you did something similar with a story about, oh I dunno, a lion in the jungle, it might feel odd. But given Selznick's subject matter and his careful use of both his own illustrations, movie stills, and sketches, the book holds together. The writing is second to the illustrations, but it's still heads and tales better than most of the crummy kidlit you'll stumble across. Sometimes you hold a book in your hands and it feels like a classic from day one. \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" radiates that feeling.u hard.

B00005ASOI|5.0|This movie was a regular feature on Saturday nights in the west Texas town I grew up in, part two of a double feature showed on summer nights in 1978(The Ramones Rock and Roll High School would proceed it). The place would be packed by skate punks,red-necks,college kids,Air-Force pilots, and old hippies.  <br />It was great stuff, and people talked about this cult classic for years.  <br />The sound-track by The Goblins was an eerie addition to a near perfect horror flick,and anyone considering buying this should buy the set that includes the audio by them. <br />I can't add anything that hasn't been said previously,regarding the actual movie plot or about this genious director,but I've added what I feel this movie deserves--a glimpse into it's status as an original in it's genre. <br />The lighting,colors and imagery,along with the music are timeless. <br />
0743455967|5.0|I would not consider myself a huge Stephen King fan, but this book is amazing. If you're at all interested in being a writer this book is a must. It's the kind of book you can open at any page and be inspired or just amazed at this man's journey. It's a brave, honest book..that will inspire even the biggest procrastinators to write.<br /><br />And for those die hard Stephen King fans, this book will only make you love him more. Out of my 45 books I have bought on Amazon, this is up there as one of my favourites.
B000GYI32M|5.0|The Third installment of The O.C. were the most disapointing season yet,with only a few of those \\"EPISODES TO REMEMBER\\" but the episodes that are good are REALLY,REALLY GOOD, episodes like The Sister Act, The man of the year and The Graduates are all Episodes to remember with the wrigthing and acting on top. <br /> <br />Even though the third season weren`t the strongest of the season, Season 4 has mad up for it in a \\" BIG \\" way,and as we all know The O.C. is comming to an end,but if you want the show to end with a BANG! be sure to tune in Thursdays at 9/8c p.m. to show you support. <br />AND DON`T FORGET THE SEASON FINALE ON FEBRUARY 22TH 9/8c P.M. <br />BUY THIS DVD,TO SAVE THE O.C.!!!

B00000K31V|5.0|Cronenberg probably conjures the best depiction of \\"virtual reality\\" and its potential psychological effect on people in this often incredible film. This is a tough and frequently unpleasant movie (what Cronenberg film isn't), relentless even (much like a video game!), but as social/technological criticism it has legs galore. I find myself studying the art direction, acting, and script to see how he tweaks and disorients so subtly all through the entire film. It is meticulously crafted. The \\"bad acting\\" noted by the other reviewers is a depiction of social disorientation, detachment, sociopathology, and near-autism in a nightmarish future society where people can no longer distinguish between illusion and reality (and, as you learn from the film, neither can the audience). The final moment of the film boldly makes that point. <br /> <br />My personal feeling is that this is Cronenberg's greatest achievement. However, it is high art and those that go into it with conventional film expectations will be (clearly ARE) disappointed. One for future film historians to write about, unable to comprehend how it sat on the fringes of acceptance for years. The negative reviews of this film deeply disturb me.
B000GY729M|5.0|So many pop or rock  singers sound exactly the same. They don't sound bad (some of them) but it gets so repetitive. What's the difference between sno patrol, the fray, howie day, lifehouse, hoobastank, nick lache, and other boy bands? Nothing obvious. Brandon Flowers, the lead singer sounds so unique and pure. He doesn't sound boyish and lovesick, nor does he sound like he hates his life. Owning both CD's, I can tell you now that this is not a waste of money. All 26 songs on both CD's (hot fuss is their debut) are fantastic. Great singing, great guitars, great bass, great drums, and great synths. I highly reccomend this to you.
B0000256VK|5.0|Owning this fine work of audio bliss speaks volumes for your taste in music.  \\"Avalon\\" was certainly ahead of its time when it was released and still is considered by many to be a gem of the 80's.  So do yourself a favor and if you haven't already, add this to your audio collection.  It makes for a nice evening when you have the time to simply sit and be and sample \\"Avalon\\" with a nice glass of wine.  Enjoy
1594481938|4.0|The cover of Hornby's A Long Way Down features critical acclaim for the work, including the Chicago Sun-Times' assessment that the book is \\"exhilarating\\" and the Seattle Times' claim that it is \\"startling.\\" Not so much, really.  <br /> <br />Now, I'm a devoted Nick Horny fan (from the moment I read \\"Nipple Jesus\\" several years ago). So don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the book, though perhaps not \\"wildly\\" as the Seattle Times promised I would. <br /> <br />A lot of people are claiming that this book is about suicide, which is misleading. It is, of course. But it's really more about life and what makes it worth living and how crappy it can be at points, and how we react to those points, and what that reveals about us. It's honest, really honest. The characters in this book reveal us. They reveal what we rarely acknowledge in ourselves -- fear, self-doubt, disillusionment, and the quiet, pervasive, and often evasive hope that maybe there's more to life afterall. And then, of course, the realization that there really isn't, and that that's OK too.  <br /> <br />The characters are aptly rendered and the truths revealed in it are poignant and touching. I didn't find myself \\"startled\\" or \\"exhilarated.\\" I did, however, find myself nodding and smiling and recognizing myself in each of the four main characters at one time or another. <br /> <br />And so I would call this book \\"comforting\\" more than anything else. A nice reminder that we're all in the same boat, really. And the trick is to just keep paddling. <br /> <br />(And the nice thing is that Hornby does all of this without being nearly as smarmy and cliche as I just was in that last bit. Thank God.)

B000KCHZK6|3.0|Norah Jones burst onto the scene in a huge way with her debut album Come Away With Me in 2002. Her mix of blues, jazz, and country with an acoustic sound won over fans and critics alike, helping her garner 6 Grammys, including Song of the Year and Album of the Year. Having that kind of success so soon creates huge (and probably unfair) expectations for future album. He follow-up, Feels Like Home, stayed very close to the formula of her debut. Will her 3rd album follow suit?<br /><br />The answer to that question is \\"not quite\\". Jones' 3rd album is a departure from her previous two, albeit a subtle one. Unlike her first albums, this one is entirely composed of new material, without any cover songs to be found. The music is definitely not as polished as her other albums, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. She's definitely making an effort to not get pigeonholed into just the sound of her debut album, despite its huge success. That doesn't mean that there aren't any good songs on the album. Some of the highlights include Thinking About You, Sinkin' Soon, and Be My Somebody. If there's a downside to the album, it's the fact that a lot of the songs sound similar, and it makes the album lack variety.<br /><br />This is a good album, although certainly not on par with her debut. But it seems to be done purposely, as Jones is try to spread out into different genres, making this somewhat of an experimental album. While not as good as her previous work, it is still a very good listen.
B000002VMI|5.0|Annie Lennox never disapoints, almost all of my favs are on this CD from \\"why\\" about a disintegrating relationship. \\"Money can't buy it\\" a quest for material things & loss of love, to a very intense \\"cold\\" about non-reciprocated love, we can all relate to her material at sometime in our lives, she has an incredible gift to express her heartache/passion &/or pain/joy through her awesome voice & lyrics.
B00006HBUA|3.0|I have a confession to make.  I didn't grow up watching cartoons.  As a result, I've only seen a handful of episodes of this show in my entire life.  Yet, I was curious about the live action version, so I finally sat down and watched it.<br /><br />The Mystery Inc. Gang is in the middle of another exciting case.  Yet when they've captured the ghost, something strange happens.  A microphone is trust into Fred's face (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and suddenly the gang starts fighting.  Velma (Linda Cardellini) is tired of Fred taking all the credit.  And Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is absolutely sick of always being the damsel in distress.  Only Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and Scooby-Doo are interested in staying together.  And so the gang breaks up.<br /><br />Some time later, they are brought back together by Mandavarious (Rowan Atkinson).  He owns Spooky Island, a hip college resort.  Unfortunately, his guests are arriving as normal college students and leaving as zombies.  Will the Mystery Inc. Gang be able to reconcile to solve the case?<br /><br />The problem with taking a half hour program and making it a full length movie is the added time.  The writers tried to deal with that my adding the conflict within the group.  However, so little time is spent on it that it feels like an after thought.  Instead, the movie spends most of its time focusing on the story, which makes sense for the most part.  There's a twist at the end that I thought was just plain weird, but maybe that's just me.  Matthew Lillard is the standout member of the cast.  His Shaggy perfectly brought the cartoon character to life.  And the computer animated Scooby, while looking like a cartoon was believable.<br /><br />There are some parts that might frighten small children, but most will be ok with it.  It's a mixed bag, at least for this non-fan of the series.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I just love this CD especially the song \\"come away with me\\" it is such a romantic/free song. Don't so much like the following CD she did with the heavier country tinge, I love her sound when its closer to Billie Holiday & reminiscent of a smokey intimate jazz/blues club. She is so very talented,& beautiful on the inside & out, I have a soft spot for this CD & so many of the songs recorded on it.
B000KRN67C|5.0|Three years prior I stumbled upon Sanctus Diavolos at a local music store and bought it on impulse, never before hearing of Rotting Christ.  I have mixed feelings about that album due to it's highly repetitive nature.  It did, however, have some excellent standout tracks which were good enough to keep me interested.  Then comes Theogonia.<br /><br />I am floored.  Every track presented here is standout and not a single negative comes to mind.  Gone from Theogonia is the repetitve riffing, chorus, and drawn out sound effects that bogged down Sanctus Diavolos instead replaced by original, creative, and fresh works that should cement Rotting Christ's place in the metal world indefinitely.  I am now the proud owner of every Rotting Christ album from Thy Mighty Contract on up and in my opinion this is the pinnacle of their work- their darkest, heaviest, hardest hitting effort to date.  I predict that 2007 will be the year of Rotting Christ and hopefully they attract the recognition they so deserve for this accomplished album.<br /><br />If you own any Rotting Christ and enjoyed them IN THE SLIGHTEST you owe it to yourself to give Theogonia a listen.  They have far exceeded my expectations with this excellent release as I'm sure they will yours.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are:<br />Xaoeteneto (The Sign of Prime Creation)<br />Enuma Elish<br />Gaia Tellus<br />Nemecic<br />He, The Aethyr<br />Threnody

B00005N5SF|4.0|Which doesn't really say very much given the \\"quality\\" of the majority of the episodes of this season.  Still, in the first episode which closely resembles the \\"Squire of Gothos\\" from Season 1, we get \\"superior\\" beings who become intoxicated with their powerful telekinetic powers and become living proof of George Orwell's famous pronouncement in \\"Animal Farm\\": \\"Power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"  It what can be described a painful episode in more ways than one to watch, we get to see Spock and Kirk made to look extremely foolish and humiliated almost beyond bearing but then managed to turn the tables around and to have the self-restraint to not take revenge when the opportunity arises.  All in all, this is an above average episode and is certainly one of the better ones of season 3.<br /><br />In the second episode, we get another example of a powerful race rationalising that superior power makes it alright to impose your designs on the less superior.  Here, in order to perpetuate the species at all costs, the Scalosians decide that it's okay to kidnap, use and discard the unsuspecting for their greater \\"good\\".  Like the first episode in this volume, while not great this episode still ranks among the better ones of the season.<br /><br />Overall we get two episodes which highlight how power can easily corrupt and can even be \\"rationalised\\" as a perfectly good reason to abuse, exploit and manipulate the less powerful.<br /><br />Two of the more interesting episodes make this volume come under the \\"nice to have but not essential\\" category if you picking which volumes to collect and keep.

B000ASDFJU|3.0|I bought this version of the dvd set and love the series.  Unfortunately, the \\"sputtering\\" happens on every dvd player we have including the computer dvd player and playstation2.  It's throughout the seasons and annoying because sometimes you're missing a few seconds or a few minutes.  We've tried playing through it in slow motion but it just freezes completely or skips.  With such a smartly written show, any dialogue missed is very upsetting.  We're trying to return it and just buy the used versions of the individual box sets.  It's just awful.

0307346609|5.0|On its own terms - as a fictional look at humanities war with the zombies - this is a fantastic book. Told as a series of interviews with the survivors,  it is a chilling and horrifying story right up there with the best of George Romero. But what made this book so vividly frightening for me was the way the zombies are used as a stand in for \\"avian bird flu\\" or whatever other pandemic or scare comes along, and how easily THAT doomsday scenario could come true.  <br /> <br />This book gets almost everything right. The profiteers who make millions hawking anti-zombie pills that may or may not work (Tamiflu, anyone?). The sheer sense of panic that would engulf our pampered society when our entire industrial complex grinds to a halt. (Peak oil!) The terrible choices that societies make to survive, essentially condemning entire sectors of their countries to gruesome deaths. The military greatly overestimating the effectiveness of their high-tech toys. (Insurgents!) Governments lying to their citizens in order to \\"protect\\" them (Noted without comment.)It is an all too possible look at what could happen to us if we were caught unawares by a threat we didn't take seriously. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.

B000J233SK|5.0|Take a journey through an exotic, alluring world with Canadian singer/multi-instrumentalist Loreena McKennitt; a world where east harmonizes soulfully with west.<br /><br />I am a late-comer to McKennitt's music, but what a wonderful find she has been! \\"The Book of Secrets\\" is a musical masterwork, conjuring magical images and dreamscapes of rare color. Being a fan of Clannad, and to a lesser extent of Enya, I find McKennitt's music to be more haunting, more deeply spiritual and more aurally textural than either of the other two.<br /><br />There are many inviting tales inside \\"The Book of Secrets\\", but none more entertaining than her 1997 hit single, \\"The Mummer's Dance\\", a positively addicting blend of Arabic percussion, hypnotic drones, and beautiful vocal melody. I consider myself much more a World music fan than a New-Ager, but this song is a genre-buster; cutting a wide appeal across World, Celtic, New Age, Folk, and even Pop.  The more traditionally Celtic \\"Skellig\\" paints the lonely picture of an ancient Irish Monk, devoutly sequestered in the harsh Skellig Islands. The instrumental \\"Marco Polo\\" transports us to the smoky late-night Bazaars of Arabia, where mystery, danger and romance await around every narrow corner; behind every silken veil. You can almost smell the opium. And perhaps my favorite is \\"The Highwayman\\", a tragic love story whose lyrics are adapted from the famous poem by Alfred Noyes. McKennitt is obviously a life-long student of classic poetry, and her own lyric-writing reads like it. These songs resonate. These songs intoxicate.<br /><br />Clearly, McKennitt's musical journey has brought her a long way from the misty moors of Ireland to the mysterious markets of Marrakech. Atop it all, her ringing soprano stirs the very soul of the ancient traveler, the lover; the dreamer. You wouldn't imagine that an artist could weave Celtic and Arabic styles so seamlessly in to one tapestry, but not only does McKennitt do just that, she does it so beautifully that it makes one realize that these ancient sounds are not so diverse after all. She has found, at the core of it, that Eastern and Western music share a common and radiant soul.beautifully that it makes one realize that these ancient sounds are not so diverse after all.

B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I watched this Masterpiece Theatre version and Loved it! I then read the book, for the first time, and realized how they totally chopped up the book with many inaccuracies. I still love the movie because I do think they got the perfect casting. Ruth Wilson is a great Jane eyre and I absolutely Love toby stephens as Rochester. I've only seen one other version of Jane Eyre and that's the Timothy Dalton version. While I thought that he portrayed Rochester well, Clark was a horrible choice for jane Eyre. She was mousy and hardly passionate like Ruth Wilson.  <br /> <br />Now, that being said, I did not like that they COMPLETELY chopped up the entire story in so many places that I was actually astonished when I read the book. I still will own the BBC version when it comes out in may, but I really, really wished they would have made the movie more accurate with this cast, because then it would have been absolutely AMAZING and no other Jane Eyre's would ever have to be made! <br />Some of the inaccuracies are: <br /> <br />1.Bessie is not the one to tell her of her Aunt's wish to see her before she dies, John is <br />2. Blanche is not blond, but brunette <br />3. The Love scene in the garden was shown in a meadow in daylight, not with the giant tree at night,(totally a disappointment and anticlimatic) <br />4. St. John did not find her on some cliff or crag, but at his door in the rain. (they totally left out all scenes of her starvation and begging) <br />5. They brought in a Gypsy to read the fortunes, when the book is plain that it's Rochester who is disguised like a gypsy. <br /> <br />These are only a few of the discrepancies and they add so much other stuff that is not even hinted at in the story that it really makes it seem like a completely different version of the book was written. <br /> <br />Even so, It is a great movie in itself and the casting is wonderful <br />I would love to see the 2 main characters in another version with more accuracy. <br /> <br />Some have complained of the gloomy nature of the film, but I think that it is spectacular. The Timothy Dalton version is not gloomy enough and I think it adds to the gloomy nature of her life.
B000ERU9S2|5.0|Great film with drama and action what more can you ask from a film!!!!!
B000GIXEIG|4.0|There is a psychological edge to this movie that I liked. The Icelandic atmosphere, the wind, the desolate landscape creeps into the story as another character. Grendal's chivalry is not far fetched. Beowulf is caught in the middle of Horthgar and Grendel's feud, which was very interesting. The pace of the movie is slow by American standards, but if you allow the story to seduce you, it becomes a unique experience.

B00000IL26|4.0|I never cared for the title track when I first heard it, regarding it as little more than a boogaloo period piece.  But after listening to numerous attempts to copy the formula (and repeat its commercial success), it's easier to understand the attention the original has received.  Morgan and his cast of players seem to understand that it's all about the \\"groove,\\" and his conservative, underplayed solo, always staying inside the rhythmic pocket, insures that this sidewinder never goes off course.  Its only rival among all the Sidewinder wannabes is probably Kenny Dorham's \\"Una Mas.\\"<br /><br />Regarding editions, I've heard both the RVG remaster and the 1990 transfer, and prefer the earlier edition.  The boosting of bass and treble frequencies, perhaps impressive to some ears, contributes little to the serpent's sinuous and seductive path.
B0009W5JS2|3.0|I'm not sure what other people were expecting when I read their reviews.  It's a sequel to a bad movie, and it stars Ice Cube, Xzibit and Samuel L. Jackson (who will clearly take any part for the right price).  They couldn't even fine semi-famous actors to portray the token \\"hot chick.\\"  What did you expect?  Of course the acting is terrible.  Of course the plot makes no sense and there are a bunch of ridiculous explosions.  Again, what did you expect?<br /><br />I could have lived my whole life without seeing this movie and I wouldn't have missed a thing, but I happened to catch it on TV, and it's now awful.  It is forgettable, but that's not the same thing.  The movie is filled with terrible dialog and predictable twists, but who cares?  They blow a lot of stuff up, and it will make you laugh--not at the intended jokes, of course--but at the fact that it seems to take itself seriously from time to time.  Plus, you have Jackson and Willem Dafoe mailing in their performances, and Ice Cube trying as hard as can be to NOT be tongue-in-cheek and failing miserably.  That alone is worth the 90 minutes of your time, especially if you're doing something else and just want the background noise.
B00000K3CR|4.0|Who didn't wonder and wish they were 'all grown up' when they were young? For Josh, his wish comes true and, as the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for.<br /><br />Underlying the comedic element of this movie is true wisdom.  Josh finds himself living all his dreams but at a cost of those things (and people) he truly values. It's a story of being yourself and living in the moment, being who you are, and what you've been given.<br /><br />I'm personally not a big Tom Hanks fan, but his portrayal of a young boy in a grownup's body (and a grownup's world) is superb.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|I saw this film several months ago and am only getting around to reviewing it now.  When I saw it, it didn't make much of an impression on me, although I fully expected it to get a slew of Oscar nominations, considering the names involved (the Academy still owes Marty a Best Director Award).  I saw it in a theatre, felt I got my money's worth, but pretty much forgot it by the time I reached home.  What stunned me was a recent critics' poll in Film Comment that listed it as the best film of the year.  Their picks are usually somewhat esoteric from a mainstream point of view - the target audience for this film - so I was surprised they acclaimed it so highly.    The strengths of The Departed are the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Ray Winstone, the swift pacing (a result of Scorsese's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker's, usual brilliant work) and the premise, lifted from the Hong Kong actioner, Infernal Affairs, which Scorsese's film might be a slight improvement from.  Also, Mark Wahlberg's profanity spewing performance somehow manages to be very entertaining.    Among the weaknesses are Jack Nicholson's incredibly obnoxious presence.  He seems to be doing his utmost to steal every scene and ends up merely being a distraction.  Also, the film could have been trimmed down from its 151 minutes but it rarely drags.  The symbolism is also embarassingly heavy handed, seemingly deliberately so.    This is far below Scorsese's best work, some of which represents the best of American cinema.  The Departed is merely well crafted entertainment.  No new artistic ground is being broken here.  That's not a bad thing, but it's important that viewers have clear expectations going in.    My four star rating is not based on comparing this film with Scorsese's other work, but with other films from the crime-drama genre.

0307341542|4.0|Gillian Flynn's debut novel follows a beat reporter for a relatively small Chicago newspaper.  Desperate for a unique story, the editor sends Camille, his \\"star\\" reporter, back to her hometown in Missouri to report on the murders of two young girls.  Both girls were strangled and had all their teeth removed before being dumped somewhere in the local area.  The murders aren't all Camille has to deal with, however.  Her relationship with her mother cannot be explained.  Unhealthy would be way too...healthy of a word.  Camille is a deeply-flawed, sympathetic protagonist that is easy to root for.  Especially when the novel reaches its climax and Camille is forced to face here deepest anxieties and fears.<br /><br />The murder mystery is a main part of the novel, but the great thing is that Flynn also incorporates the family drama aspect, and the aspect of living in a small town.  Camille desperately wanted to get out of the town, and she finally did, but now that she comes back after all these years in the big city, she once again has to adapt herself to small town politics, and all of us who are from small towns know exactly how tough and annoying that can be.  As Camille is forced to interact with all these people from her past, she is almost drawn back into her life during high school, and its almost sad for the reader to watch her devolve throughout the book.<br /><br />The imagery in Sharp Objects is extremely unsettling.  There are a few dream sequences that had me squirming, and Flynn's descriptions are spot-on.  In fact, in dialog as well, Flynn proves herself to be an above-average writer.  The interactions between Camille and her mother are shocking, disgusting, and, I'm sure, somewhat familiar to a lot of people.  The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that, due to its short length, it doesn't really have a chance to develop completely any more than 2 or 3 characters, and I feel that if all the characters involved had been looked at more closely, the ending of the book could have had some more meaning.  But that is the only criticism I have of this great debut novel.ked at more closely, the ending of the book could have had some more meaning.

B00000J7JO|4.0|As the reviewer below pointed out, this CD has absolutely awful mastering. This is one of the worst examples of audio compression on a professionally mastered CD that exists, and it is disgusting. They have tried to make it so loud, that the music exceeds the limits of the CD, and causes clipping and the 'static' sound. I find this CD hard to listen to, which is such a shame because the music itself is excellent.

B000LE1FAY|5.0|As so many have already mentioned, I too was disappointed when I heard that this new CD was sung entirely in French.  It wasn't until I sampled some tracks on Belinda's myspace page that I began to grasp the scope of this project. I was fortunate enough to get the CD four days before it was released and was able to MEET Belinda at her CD signing in New York City...a day I will never forget!  <br /> <br />I have been listening to this CD everyday since and cannot get over how truly amazing it is. Never before has Belinda's voice sounded so rich and so full of emmotion. She didn't just record an album; she created an experience. You can do nothing but surrender yourself to the journey Belinda takes you on with this collection. From the haunting Bonnie Et Clyde to the--blow the roof off the joint--Jezebel, Belinda delivers sheer perfection at every turn that will surprise even her most loyal of fans. Avec Le Temps is without a doubt the greatest vocal accomplishment of her career. The heart wrenching performance cuts straight to the soul. Her vocals so incredibly brilliant there is simply no language barrier. <br /> <br />This album will serve as Belinda Carlisle's greatest legacy...an artist taking a risky chance and succeeding beyond anyone's wildest imagination.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Let's cut to the chase here. If you are already a fan of Norah Jones, then you'll love this album and if you don't care for her, well, this won't change your mind. Her characteristic sound is thoroughly intact on Not Too Late, from the pensive piano-based song arrangements to the molasses texture of her voice. It's a winning formula, and I find it to be as pleasant as hot coffee on a cold Sunday morning. In other words, it meets all of my expectations, without posing much of a challenge. The discernible differences from her past work are rather subtle. For instance, the songs go down as smoothly as ever, but this time around the melodies are more intricate, and the songs take a bit longer to sink in.<br /><br />Perhaps this is due to a change in methodology; Previous albums were produced by Arif Mardin, whose deft touch provided a light and spacious feel on each recording. His passing necessitated a change, so Jones' partner (and significant other) Lee Alexander took the reins. As the couple live together and have a recording studio in their home, Not Too Late became a homegrown affair. With no clock ticking away expensive minutes of professional studio time, the atmosphere was more relaxed, allowing the pair to experiment freely and focus on subtleties. The result is an album that could pass for pleasant, yuppie dinner Muzak or one that rewards multiple listens - it's only as challenging as you want it to be.<br /><br />The first indication of this subtle shift in priorities is the complete absence of cover songs; Jones writes or co-writes every song on Not Too Late, and the familiar, languid pace eventually gives way to an unexpected agenda. With its cabaret rhythms and political overtones, \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" is a good case in point. Lyrical details imply discomfort with our current state of affairs (\\"In a boat that's built of sticks and hay, we've drifted from the shore, with a captain who's too proud to say that he dropped the oar\\"), and this is made explicit on \\"My Dear Country,\\" when Jones sings, \\"that nothing is as scary as Election Day.\\"  On \\"Until the End,\\" she brings an unnamed famous associate down a peg, and then grows even more critical on the next track, bluntly stating, \\"You are not my friend. I cannot pretend you are.\\" It's surprising to hear such sentiments on a Norah Jones album, but the languid mood disguises the dark moments just enough to render them invisible. If you like Norah Jones because her music goes down smooth and palatable, you needn't worry, but fans who choose to read between the lines will notice the change.

0887081770|5.0|This is a small book perfect for small hands. The illustrations are true to Eric Carle's other book illustrations as you would expect. Learning a new concept is never far away in his books and you won't be disappointed with this one. They are boosted for understanding by the features of the page fold-outs, fold-ups, and fold-downs. It's wonderful as a board book because those fold-flaps can handle the frequent times they are used without tearing as a page does. This story is also presented on an Eric Carle DVD or VHS which I have also rated.
006054094X|4.0|The thesis of this book is every bit as provocative as the cover promises:  did Columbus discover the new world, as conventional history teaches, or was his voyage preceded 71 years earlier by a massive Chinese fleet--in fact, several Chinese fleets--that not only discovered America, but also circumnavigated the globe centuries before the expeditions of the great European explorers? <br /> <br />In this hefty book--the paperback is 456 pages long not counting the postscript and appendices--author Gavin Menzies marshals disparate threads of evidence--some physical, some historical (such as charts predating the European voyages), and some conjectural--to stake the astounding claim that in 1421, the progressive emperor Zhu Di sent fleets commanded by Admirals Zheng He, Yang Qing, Xhou Man, Hong Bao and Zhou Wen on epic voyages that ultimately traversed the world, surveying all the continents (except Europe) along the way.    <br /> <br />Menzies is a former British submarine commander, a fact that he frequently calls to the attention of the reader.  Lacking direct evidence of the route of the Chinese voyages, Menzies substitutes in its place circumstantial theorizing based on his experience as a sailor, navigator and seafaring captain:  if the Chinese had ventured to a particular geographic location, where would they go next, given prevailing winds, ocean currents, square-rigged ships that could sail only downwind, and the need to provision the ships with food and water?  Postulating answers to these questions, Menzies traces the routes of the Chinese voyages, contending that the fleets split up to survey continents and islands, sailed to specific latitudes to fix the position of navigational stars, and systematically explored the world--leaving colonies, crafts and agriculture of distinct Chinese origin in their wake.   <br /> <br />Readers raised with a Eurocentric view of the world will naturally regard these claims with skepticism and astonishment.  It is true thatMenzies' book is an advocacy piece:  evidence of a pre-Columbus Chinese presence, however equivocal or slim, is adduced in support of the thesis; evidence that contradicts the thesis is explained away.  For example, when charts are inaccurate, Menzie often attributes the error to the fact that the Chinese did not account for ocean currents.  One must wonder, however, how navigators who were sufficiently skilled to navigate the globe and determine longitude by elapsed time during a lunar eclipse could nevertheless fail to realize that currents were affecting their course. <br /> <br />It is also intriguing to compare Menzies' theories with those in \\"1491\\" and \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\"  I, too, wonder how it would be possible for the Chinese, with domesticated animals, to interact with people in the Americas without communicating infectious diseases and devastating those communities.  Menzies' failure to address--even realize--these possible flaws in his work calls into question the validity of his thesis and suggests that alternate inferences from the evidence might be warranted. <br /> <br />Still, the old adage says that where there is smoke, there is fire.  Menzies presents enough credible evidence to raise serious questions regarding the Eurocentric view.  In the appendices, Menzies lists and categorizes the evidence discussed throughout the book:  charts and maps; shipwrecks; transplanted flora and fauna; historical accounts; carved stones; common crafts (such as lacquering); metalwork; and even DNA.  Even if one rejects his most extravagant claims, one would still need to acknowledge that Chinese civilization had progressed far beyond that of Europe, and that our Eurocentric view of the world has caused us to ignore the accomplishments of this mighty civilization.   <br /> <br />Menzies writes well, and though the narrative periodically devolves into open speculation, there is more than enough substance to keep the reader's attention fixed and to justify Menzies' call for further study.   <br /> <br />This book is well worth the price even if one ultimately disbelieves the conclusion. <br />
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Ever since I saw Peter Chung's creation mow down piles of enemies with her two Uzis, a leather S&M get up, and little else, I fell in love.  Aeon Flux was bizarre, action-packed, and short on words (actually, almost none at all when she first debuted on Liquid T.V.).  I watched it over and over, I drew Aeon multiple times until I got her right, and the breakneck pace that was established in the film still affects my writing to this day.<br /><br />So it was with no small trepidation that I approached the Aeon Flux movie.  How could they possibly do justice to a bizarre series that was as much a style as it was a cartoon, alternately ugly and sleekly beautiful all at the same time?<br /><br />Taking place in 2415, Aeon (Charlize Theron sporting a brunette `do) is an agent of the Monicans.  The Monicans wage a secret war against Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas), a well-meaning despot who struggles to keep the fragile city of Bregna together.  The Earth has long since been devastated by a plague, and there are only five million survivors left in the city. And yet there's something rotten in the city of Bregna, for Trevor's brother Oren (Jonny Lee Miller) is about to stage a coup.<br /><br />After her sister Una (Amelia Warner) is murdered, Aeon's out for revenge against the supposed despot. Assisting Aeon in her mission of revenge is Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) who happens to have hands for feet.  And yet when she finally faces her target, Aeon discovers there's something very familiar about Trevor that gives her pause.<br /><br />Aeon Flux was directed by a woman (Karyn Kusama) and her sensibilities bring a refreshing touch to a genre that is all too muscular, boxy, and grim. Like The Fifth Element, Aeon Flux is an entry in a science fiction genre that avoids the standard futuristic tropes and injects new and bizarre technology into it.  Body modification, as evidenced by Sithandra, is an accepted part of sciety.  Technology is organic, ranging from killer grass to dart guns shaped like beehives, computers made of water to holograms formed of harp-like strings.  All the Monican agents are linked by a telepathic connection that lets them visualize each other in a sort of World Wide Web of the mind. Fashion styles are reminiscent of French couture. A zeppelin computer that looms overhead has all the appearance of a monstrous jellyfish. Even the city looks like a giant carnation from above.<br /><br />Aeon herself is played with deadly seriousness by Theron, who draws on her ballerina training to adopt a dancer's pose. Her martial arts is as much an art form as it is combat style, and the graceful leaps and jumps that the cartoon version effortlessly executed are much in evidence here; an amazing achievement, given that the original character's proportions barely conformed to reality.<br /><br />So what's the problem?  Critics lambasted the film, characterizing it as too complicated.  It's difficult for me to agree with them, because fans of the show will know precisely what's going on...and yet the movie wasn't spoiled for me either.  In fact, the biggest flaw of the film is the motive for Oren to \\"recycle\\" people in the city of Bregna. His \\"my way or else\\" proposition isn't really justified in the movie's narrative, such that we just have to trust that there's simply no room for compromise between the two ideologies battling it out on screen.  But once you're past that hurdle, the film is as much eye-candy as it is an interesting post-apocalyptic entry into alternative sci-fi.<br /><br />The backlash on this film is suspicious.  Perhaps it was Theron's Oscar win. Perhaps it's simply that many critics don't like science fiction.  Or perhaps it's that a truly feminist take on a science fiction world makes male reviewers uncomfortable.  Whatever the case, sci-fi fans should definitely give Aeon Flux a chance.rass to dart guns shaped like beehives, computers made of water to holograms formed of harp-like strings.

B000KRNCYY|1.0|I almost completely wasted my money on this version when some of my favorite songs are only found on the deluxe version. I think it is a really cheap ploy to have 2 versions when the deluxe version is a bit harder to find. I almost bought the regular version without even realizing that it was incomplete. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Get the deluxe version and get the real deal.
6305428352|5.0|I have loved this movie since I saw it for the first time. It is one of the best, in my opinion.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|Well done all around. Good acting, good direction - and based on the cast and crew I would have assumed no less.
B000M4RG42|3.0|This movie was OK. It was informational as I really didn't know too much about the history behind Iwo Jima so I'll leave it at that.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|.I should really stay away from these \\"feel good\\" comedies.  But I must admit I laughed out loud a little bit.  It was worth watching just to see the performance of Alan Arkin.<br /><br />The story follows a family driving from Arizona to California so that their little daughter can compete in the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" contest.  The film pokes fun at everything, including the human potential movement, the concept of a dysfunctional family, beauty pageants in general, and homophobia.  It all seemed so stupid that I felt like turning it off at once.  But then Alan Arkin came on the scene, cast brilliantly in the role of the \\"dirty old grandpa\\" and he absolutely stole the show.<br /><br />But one performance does not make a film I like.  And this firm doesn't even get on the playing field  in that category.  I just wish I had the power to cut and paste the sections with Alan Arkin and just watch those parts.  He was really that good.<br /><br />Comedy lovers who want to come out of the theater with a warm and fuzzy feeling might like this film.  But to grumpy old me, with the exception noted above, it was barely tolerable.
B000I0QM0E|5.0|As a child I was familiar with the headless horseman.  Although I never remember the ghost being so homicidal.  This movie is rated R although much of the content is not so terribly inappropriate.  Of course it can be violent at times with the death scenes overall this is an excellent tale.  The story is not overloaded and is easy to understand so I would think children would enjoy it.  Tim Burton helped recreate this tale but not in a horrific way.  The sound is excellent and the visuals are all that more beautiful on BluRay.<br /><br />The story takes place during the turn of the century in New York.  Johnny Depp who plays Crane does so very well.  The acting is excellent in this tale Burton seems to recreate this time very well.  Clothing, architechture, and even language seems to be in sync with the year 1799.  I have watched many of Burtons films and was happy to see his use of imagery.  Although like most of Burtons films they are dark.  The movie has some wonderful scenes but doesn't seem to keep me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this wonderful film or are curious to watch it on BluRay I would say it's excellent.  The quality is not as great as newer movies but in general it still looks great.  Good enough to see every detail on Depps face.
0553208845|5.0|A simple, yet profound and engaging tale of a young man's quest for enlightenment and meaning in life.  His quest takes him down many paths and teaches him many lessons.  It's certainly a realistic experience that many human beings travel and often get stuck without finding peace.  Perhaps this should be a required meaning for every human being who seeks peace of mind and serenity.  Siddhartha experineces the trap of worldly illusions, addictions, becomes suicidal and feels that life is meaningless; however in the end he awakens to the presence and peace in life.<br /><br />Through his journey some of the important things he learns are:<br /><br />Not to run from the self, but to embrace it.<br /><br />The world is beautiful and magnificent without an endless search;  it is simple.  One must experinece life as if a child.<br /><br />Be present and enter what is in front of you.<br /><br />Cannot discover self through thoughts we must experience it.<br /><br />The secret to life is presence and love is the most important thing in the world.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone on a spiritual path or anyone looking to enjoy a great book.<br /><br />In addition, check out my award winning book, \\"Your Daily Walk with the Great Minds\\"  It talks about similar principles and guides you through each day.<br /><br />Coming Soon My New Book, \\"Eastern Wisdom for Your Soul\\"<br /><br />Make Today Your Best Day Ever.

2070518426|1.0|I'm in the equivalent of 3rd year french (advanced conversational) and found this to be a WONDERFUL read, it read pretty easily, especially since i've read it in english. <br /> <br />HOWEVER... the book is HORRIBLE quality. The pages come out if you so much as look at them funny. I am NOT hard on books, but just in the first reading, 10 pages pulled out. I HIGHLY recommend finding a different edition.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is a cynical copy of so much American music from the 1970s to the present day.  Do you think John Lennon would have written Come Together in 1969 if Aerosmith would not have covered that song in the 1970s?  I could go on.  What about Carry That Weight... ahem, obviously inspired by the 1980 hockey victory over the Soviets.  100% stolen music from the Americans.  The Beatles are the foremost musical timethieves.  I say we need to stop them before they steal rap.  We could all be uninvented unless the Beatles are stopped now.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Disregarding the price, which is unbelievably high, Enterprise is an important part of the Star Trek franchise, one which didn't deserve the ridicule it recieved. I have been a die hard Star Trek fan since I was a kid, and I appreciate the loose ends this series tie together--without boring me. I'm hoping that this isn't the last series, what will they think of next? Amazing!
038572179X|2.0|This is the first book I have ever read by this author. He is a gifted writer and can spin a lovely phrase. However, the basic premise of this book - that an ignorant pre-adolescent child can influence events - struck me as false. I did not for a minute believe Briony was a real person. And, the truth is, human lives are seldom sent spinning out of control by the thoughts, actions, and lies of an adolescent.  <br /> <br />Once I saw where this tale was leading, I put down the book. The author had brought his story to an absurd and intensely frustrating spot. As far as I was concerned, I didn't care a whit about Briony. So everything that happened stuck in my craw and seemed just plain old ridiculous. The author was unconvincing; no kid is that innocent at her age. <br /> <br />Perhaps it all worked out in the end but I didn't bother to wait around to find out. <br /> <br />Here's my hint to all authors: the pre-adolescent mind is not a very interesting place to spend time. Spare your readers the trip to this tiresome, and in this book, very dangerous place.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This collection of songs was put together so well.  It truly has all of Stevie Wonder's greatest hits and is wonderful to listen to!
B0009QTS1M|5.0|This was an extremely well done movie. If you like Rome stories and you like action films, you wont be dissapointed. The acting was really good, too.
0307237699|5.0|Senator Obama offers a view of America that is both practical and inspirational.  He addresses our most basic need which is moving away from the bitter divisive politics of today towards something more important and essential for our nation. <br /> <br />I would suggest that you read Dreams From My Father first.  This will help you understand how the life of Barack Obama has influenced his political life (and gave him the title of his second book).  A very good read.

B000M4RG4C|3.0|to assault the JUMP back to the 3 men already in the states dealing with the tradegy FLASHBACK to the war for a few minutes BACK to the really old war veteran talking BACK to the war.   <br /> <br />Amazingly confused or saying what the hell?  Because thats what this movie is.  I loved \\"LETTERS\\" and wanted to love this but the way Eastwood tells the story is horrible.  It jumps back and forth from character to character with reckless abandon.  And by throwing us in without knowing the characters we or at least \\"I\\" did not care or root for any of the characters.  In \\"Letters\\" Eastwood gave us time to know the characters and experience what happened to them with them.  In \\"Fathers\\" we are jerked out of the battle scenes to 3 heroes at home that I don't care about. <br /> <br />You see the problem?  It expects us to care for the characters but they've given us no reason to care about them.  If Eastwood gave us 30 minutes to get to know the charactes and told the story chronologically this could have been a masterpiece.  And in the end I started to get bored with the battle scenes, we know who is going to live, we know the Americans win, and we don't care about the characters.   <br /> <br />The actors don't help us either.  There were some bad performances and some alright performances.  Adam Beach probably gave the best showing but  he was just alright. <br /> <br />The good?  Yea there are some great moments, but I'm just ticked because Eastwood had a chance to make something amazing, but instead he screwed everything up.  Overall this is a failure, go see \\"Letters\\" instead and actually care...
1416500294|4.0|I bought six copies of this edition of Treasure Island. They were passed out to my six enriched reading 4th grade students. My intention was to give a single copy up to the winner of a quiz. However, the price per copy was so reasonable that I decided to make a gift to each student.  I like this edition because it has a series of post scripts.
B00005JPKE|3.0|I really wanted to like \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" more than the three star rating that I gave it here. With a few honorable exceptions, most of the movies that depict the Japanese in World War II (at least the ones not made by Japanese) range from blatantly racist \\"ha, ha yankee you die now!\\" to ones that show the Japanese as sorts of noble savages.<br /><br />I give credit to \\"Letters\\" for showing what typical Japanese soldiers were probably like.  But the movie suffers a great deal from being sloooooow.  I actually heard one member of the audience snoring at one point.  I didn't fall asleep, but I think that if they had shortened it by about half an hour, it would have been much better.<br /><br />Another gripe is that some of the invasion scenes looked awfully cheesy.  It was pretty obvious that the invasion fleet was nothing but a bunch of CGIs.  I wonder if the film would have had a better effect if it had used newsreel footage instead.<br /><br />I did think it was interesting that the film interlocked with \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" to the degree it did.  I saw some of the same footage of the battle in both movies. The two films have a number of scenes in common with only the point of view shifting.<br /><br />One final note:  I've noted some people gushing here about how the Japanese soldiers were \\"just like us\\" and how they only wanted to go home too.  This is true to some degree.  But I would recommend people read books like \\"the Rape of Nanking\\" (where the Japanese army ran wild in China and killed about 200,000 Chinese civilians), maybe read \\"Factories of Death\\" (about the Japanese biological warfare unit that did things like vivisect living human beings), watch \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\" to see how badly Allied prisoners were treated by the Japanese, or read about the charming practice of abducting Korean women to be \\"comfort women\\" (i.e. sex slaves for the \\"honorable\\" Imperial Army).<br /><br />My point is, yes, there were a lot of ordinary Japanese who only wanted to go home after serving their country.  But the bottom line is that their country was a brutal, expansionist nation that chalked up as many --if not more-- bodies than Nazi Germany. Kuribayashi was one of the most formidable Japanese commanders the US ever faced on land and his soldiers fought bravely and well...but let's remember: it was in the service of an evil cause.ir country.

6305692572|5.0|Far under rated! Total BS that both Meg & Andy were not at least nominated for Golden Globes. This is the only movie I actually like Andy Garcia in actually. He seems to play a lot of shady slimy characters which I really do not feel suite him. In this role he was so loving, kind, honest, and devoted. Even with his typical male issues he was still the husband I'd want. Meg did an amazing job as an alcoholic and it's a very difficult and commendable role to take on. Loved the little girls in it as well. The littlest one just takes my heart. Such a sweetie!
0446677450|3.0|<br />Here are the main themes of this book. Start early to save. When you have money, buy things that <br />will make money for you (stocks, bonds, rental real estate, etc.) instead of things that will <br />cause you extra expenses or will depreciate. Hire someone to run your businesses so you have time <br />to make more money. Have capital gains instead of salary. Take some chances. You have to buy before <br />you can sell at a profit. <br /> <br />There is more, of course, and different people might select different main ideas. <br /> <br />The book reminded me of a motivational speaker. It is best for the reader that has a strong, <br />burning ambition to be very, very, very rich. It is for those whose goal is more money and whose <br />hobby is also more money. I suspect it is fine for them. <br /> <br />Those that want enough money to not have to worry about money, or those with more modest goals, <br />will probably find other books more useful. The first two ideas are useful for all. <br /> <br />Also read \\"The Millionaire Next Door.\\" Besides comparing the two books, it might be interesting to <br />compare the people that favored each. <br />
0393061434|4.0|As someone who was there (but not at Apple) \\"when the pudding whipped creamy,\\" I expected more from this book.  <br /> <br />Woz's exploits as a precocious math and science whiz, phone phreaker and all-around high-energy, enthusiastic and jolly fellow are interesting but aren't much differentiated in the book from other talented people of that era.  <br /> <br />As mentioned in another review, some editing would have helped.  <br /> <br />But there's no denying that these are the words of a true visionary of the time. <br /> <br />

B00005O3VC|5.0|From the opening credits to the final crane shot, you'll be in stitches. <br /> <br />It's hysterical at a level that any 12 year old can enjoy, but at the same time it's a sophisticated, post-modern romp through history that any adult with a funny bone can enjoy. <br /> <br />This movie is silly, irreverent, illogical, ahistorical, hysterical, naughty, and utterly charming.   <br /> <br />Monty Python is a comedy genius!!!!!
B000001EAQ|4.0|Pop has all the elements of a groundbreaking record:  vision, sound, songwriting, and the ambition to think outside of the box and redefine how music is made for the next generation.  Pop should've been the Bitches Brew for rock music -- the perfect melding of electronica and post-punk rock, woven with sounds from eras past, present and future.  The songs are great but the record falls somewhat short of expectations because of poor mixing or incomplete or hurried arrangements.  If they had taken another 6 months with this record, we would be talking about it instead of 'Joshua Tree', 'War', 'Achtung Baby' and 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' as U2's definitive masterpiece.  That said, this is still a landmark record of the 90's, and U2 has proven that they can do what most bands can't. <br /> <br />The band has recognized some of the original recording's shortcomings and have issued remixes and newer versions of some of the songs.  The version I loaded to my computer and burned to CD-R for the road has what I think are the best versions of the songs.     <br /> <br />1.  Discotheque:  a perfect combination of a rock anthem with electronica beats.  Though the version on the CD is very good, the new mix on the best of 1990-2000 is outstanding.  Even more ambitious and equally catchy is the 8 minute dance remix which appears on the CD single and relies mostly on an ambient keyboard and house beat.   <br /> <br />2.  Do You Feel Loved? - My favorite track on this CD.  The original version is great.  Bono sings with a grim desperation and Adam Clayton provides a great bass line over a Larry Mullen electronic/rock fused beat.  Edge provides his classic riffs with a darker, processed, yet human feel.  The U2 sound blends very naturally in the techno/electronica context on this sound. <br /> <br />3.  Mofo - Perhaps the most ambitious and successful experiment on this CD.  Mofo is truly wild techno rock that few bands have been able to achieve.  The original version is excellent, but the way they performed this one live is outstanding.  If you can find a live version of it, put it on your mix.  The Mofo remixes also have some great takes on this song. <br /> <br />4.  If God Will Send His Angels - This track sounds hurried and over-produced.  Bono needed to pare down the lyrics, and it sounds like they came up with several different riffs and tones for this song, but did not actually reach agreement on how they wanted the final product to sound.  The underlying song, however, is very good.  It is a moderate to slow ballad that has a country feel despite the electronica keyboard, beats and guitar effects.  I wish they would remake this one. <br /> <br />5.  Staring at the Sun - The second single from the record.  A very good song which was remixed on the Best of 1990-2000.  The best version of this song, however, is the acoustic version they performed live on the Pop Tour which is on a CD Single (`Please').  With the electronics stripped away, we hear the great harmonies of Bono and Edge and the underlying essence of this song.  A great take. <br /> <br />6.  Last Night On Earth - U2 released this as a single and I never understood why.  The writing and hooks are incomplete.  Even though it is has the power of U2 rock anthem, this one needed more work.  It is certainly no `Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me'. <br /> <br />7.  Gone - Another real favorite of mine.  The version on the Best of 1990-2000 is outstanding and more fully realizes its potential.  There is much more clarity in the guitar playing and in Bono's voice.  The subject matter, about a person who has had it easy for so long and doesn't know the meaning or value of anything and finds himself at a critical breaking point, is gripping.  I'd take this song with any great U2 song. <br /> <br />8.  Miami - A lot of people hate this track.  I am not a hater, but it did require a lot more work.  A techno track filled with tape loops and guitar samples, but it falls short ofsome of the tracks on Zooropa like `Daddy's Going to Pay for Your Crashed Car' which had more polished writing and song development. <br /> <br />9.  The Playboy Mansion - The record becomes delightfully unpredictable with this track.  This is a perfect melding of country and electronica, with humorous and insightful lyrics about the playboy mansion as a cultural icon.  Johnny Cash could've sung this one.  There are plenty of nice hooks and melodies to keep you humming in your car. <br />   <br />10.  If You Wear That Velvet Dress - a haunting, slow, bass driven ballad, with ambient textures and tasteful guitar hooks.  Cowboy Junkies meet Massive Attack.  A brilliant achievement. <br /> <br />11.  Please - Another favorite of mine driven by Adam Clayton's active bass.  The live version of this track which is available on the `Please' CD single is outstanding.  Edge is more settled on the guitar parts for this song, and his playing takes this song to another level.   <br /> <br />12.  Wake Up Dead Man - For anyone who has expressed disgust with those who kill in the name of religion, this song is for you.  The version on the CD is badly overproduced, but the song somehow survives.  I would love to see the band remake this song in an acoustic format.   <br /> <br />Pop has its flaws, but it is still one of the best records of the 1990's and one of their most compelling efforts.  Twenty years from now, Pop will be remembered as one of their most inspired efforts. <br />
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I saw him singing \\"new shoes\\" on a tv show recently & immediately went to the computer to see who he was & where I could find this CD.  I just got the cd & have been playing it over & over again.  Can't get enough of it.  My favorite songs are \\"new shoes, rewind, last request, & Autumn\\", but they are all great.  This is one of the best new cd's I've heard in a long time & I'm checking his website daily as they are adding more tour dates & he may be here in March. This guy is an awesome talent with a very soulful voice & I'm now a huge fan. Highly recommend this cd. :)
0060832819|1.0|Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism? <br /> <br />Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ... <br /> <br />Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO.
B00005RYL2|4.0|I really like this movie.  It's one of those you can just rewatch every once in a while.  Sean Connery is delightful and Chris Lamb is pretty good!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Good Effort from the Director and all the Cast. The running time is a bit too long but the action is so far the best in all bond films today. Daniel Craig gets two thumbs up for performing all or most of the stunts by himself. <br />He is very serious in his role. Great movie to keep and view for years to come.
0743454537|5.0|I felt very in touch with all the characters. The author was such a strong story teller that I need not be lost in descriptions of setting , surrounding ect. I was completely lost in every character. The end of the book brought me to tears. I loved this book.
0811806405|3.0|I found this book to be OK.  There is a lot of great information, but I found it a bit inadequate for modern wood shops.  I do not wish to build like they did 200 years ago.
B000GY729M|5.0|This album is simply put, amazing. Beginning with Sam's Town and it's lyrics \\"I've got this energy beneath my feet\\" which captures the whole album from start to finish as upbeat and catchy. The choruses are wild usually consist of layers, and the lyrics are brillant. I have to admit I was a little uneasy about this album after hearing the songs on Hot Fuss but this album totally blows the first away. It just has an energy about it that makes you feel an urge to sing to every song. Truly amazing. If the Killers next albums are likes this one, I think we can't expect to hear a lot of great music from them to come.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I can't say anything eloquent here that hasn't already been said.  But I just have to tell everyone what a wonderful movie this is.  Beautifully filmed, and a wonderful story, exciting and romantic, keeps you guessing, and with a wonderful ending.  Really one of the best movies I've seen, and so much better than most.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I've been looking for this movie since a while here in Dubai where I live. Finally found it on Amazon and booked it pronto!!!! That was the best thing I did in recent times. Amazing portrayal of emotions on screen. A timeless Classic of modern times.
B000FQJAIM|5.0|Of course I like the theatrical version best.  Sometimes the enhanced version throws you off - you're not expecting stuff.  Good show.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is probably my favorite album ever, next to Bob Dylan's \\"Bringing It All Back Home.\\" There is not a single song on this disc that I would even consider skipping over when listening to it. Every song is spectacular, and somehow manages to sound fresh and new everytime I listen to it.<br /><br />It's actually hard to listen to this album without listening to the whole thing. For the people who have listened to Radiohead starting with their more recent albums (Kid A, Amnesiac, Hail to the Thief), this album may come as a surprise. If you dislike the electronic sounds of Kid A and Amnesiac, this album is definitely for you. Even if you love those CD's, this one will probably end up becoming your favorite Radiohead CD, and possibly one of you favorite CD's in general.<br /><br />Spectacular!
B000002AGE|5.0|This album earns its place in music history--an epitome of fusion and jazz rock forthcoming. It is a unique and intricate blend of different tastes and styles of music. Zawinul provides beautifully crafted molodies; Shorter, sweet wholesome leading tones; Acuna and Badrena, delicious percussion patterns. And then, they had a pyro-technical bassist by the name of Jaco Pastorius, who provides strengthly attractive rhythmic\melodic bass sound. I play bass and guitar, and I found that his bass style does not only provide a solid rhythm section for the band, it indeed has prominent melodic roles of the band. I would consider that he takes two roles at the same time--one as a bassist and the other as a guitar player. His approach to his bass style and his music is quit similar to Jimi Hendrix to guitar or Paganini to violin.     The album earns its place in modern music history; the band earns its place in the top echelon of modern jazz pantheon. They are indeed giants among giants.
0920668364|1.0|Ok, i'm as sentimental as the next mother, but come on!  This story starts off very sweet and becomes downright creepy half way through.  Really odd book and the illustrations are awful.  I won't be reading this to my son.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|At first the album seemed different from what I expected but the more that I listened to it the more I liked it.  It has elements of everything you might expect from Mike Patton and then some. <br /> <br />
0446677450|2.0|Many of us have heard of this book, and there are almost 2000 customer reviews for it. There's some real gold in here, mainly something that'll get people motivated to learn about how money works and take more responsibility for their finances. There is a huge bias towards real estate, probably because that's what the author felt comfortable with investing in. Obviously not for everyone.
1401307787|5.0|If you want to learn how to slow down and realize where you are and what to do each day this book is the one! Easy and relaxing from the start. <br />Excellent for parents and for grandparents too.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|It's probably the first album that I loved every song on it. Every song was great. I listen to it almost everyday. I'm glad finally I bought it. This band is really amazing. 3 months ago I didn't even know the band and didn't really know about Jared Leto. But now I'm a big fan of 30 Seconds To Mars.  <br />
074356619X|5.0|I love listening to The Secret on CD!  I drive in my car many hours and it has been so wonderful listening to all the secrets of The Secret.  I like the summary of the main points that are given at the end of each chapter.  It is well put together with other speakers contributing in their own voice and not just Rhonda Byrne speaking the entire time.  There is more information in the book than on the DVD. Well worth the money!
B0002W18MU|5.0|In my opinion, Johnny Cash never had a musical voice, but he had the rest-- enough to make him a true legend. As I listened to this CD,at first I was a little embarrassed for him.But what would you expect at his age and condition!! As I listened, however, I was drawn in.He gets to you. You will be a little sad, but elevated too----and happy you have the CD.
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|This version of the 12C Platinum seems to live up to the \\"improved\\" billing in HP's ads. The processor is faster and the calculations take much less time to complete.In the programming mode, there are now 400 program lines available rather than 99. If you need it, one can now switch from HP's RPN mode to algebraic mode. The only criticism is that the keys feel cheaper and less substantial than on the original HP 12C, but perhaps its just the texture that gives that impression. And the leather case that comes with the Anniversary Edition is nice.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is a first rate CD. I guess I have been asleep, because I did not know of Mark Knopfler---and too bad for me. I think he is great and the combo with Emmylou(who I did know) is a wonderful match.The music, arrangements and lyrics all do a lot for each other. I usually do not write opinions , but if this music is at all in your area of interest--buy and enjoy.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Keep in mind, bands change. You would be foolish to expect Incubus to cover the same ground they did on something like Morning View. I listen to this album and think it different - thats all. I feel like if you enjoy listening to the development a band like Led Zeppelin made between their first album and Physical Graffiti you will like this album. Just give it a chance to stand up for itself, not compared to other things Incubus has done.

0062502182|4.0|This inspirational fable by Coelho; \\"The Alchemist\\", is an exciting novel that bursts with optimism; it is the kind of novel that tells you that everything is possible as long as you really want it to happen. As the alchemist himself says; \\"when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true\\". This is the core of the novel's philosophy and a motif that echoes behind Coelho's writing all through \\"The Alchemist\\".   Coelho also suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their \\"Personal Myth\\", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and un-fulfillment. Fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness.
B000EDWKXS|4.0|...John Malkovich's character (Cyrus the Virus) announces after taking over a state of the art prisoner transport plane.  This and many other lines help make Cyrus one of the most charismatic and lovable convicts I've seen in a long time (he is the bad guy in the movie though, but I can't help but like him).  There is tons of other great characters in this movie as well, many of them covicts.  Nicholas Cage, John Cusack, Steve Buscemi, David Chapelle, and Ving Rhames are all solid as usual. <br /> <br />Yes this is standard Jerry Bruckheimer action fare, but that's not a bad thing.  It's a movie made to entertain and that's it.  There is loads of comic relief and pleasantly cheesy dialogue that helps to make sure you don't take the film too seriously.  As mentioned by others the Unrated Extended Edition DVD has absolutely no special features, which is a little disappointing, but the movie by itself is worth the price regardless.
B00005JPKC|5.0|Clint Eastwood's \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is the perfect counterpoint to \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\": the latter, like so many other war movies, focuses solely on the American characters; the former, on the other hand, gives the audience a first hand look into the lives of Japanese soldiers. Rarely do we get to watch a war story from the opposite side. It was quite a refreshing and eye opening experience, especially since it didn't dehumanize a single character. I say this in spite of the fact that many gruesome death and destruction scenes are featured, each side fighting for what they believe to be right. This film depicts war from the \\"enemy's\\" point of view; it's an experience I recommend to everyone, especially to those who have only seen one-sided commentaries.    As the title suggests, characters frequently write letters to loved ones back on the Japanese mainland. Mostly taking place in 1944, we hear the thoughts and feelings of two soldiers--General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya)--as they write, bringing to the story an emotional depth that's incredibly compelling. Saigo writes to his wife, Hanako (Nae Yuuki), who was pregnant when he was called to duty by the Japanese government. He understandably wants to return home, not only to reunite with his wife, but also to meet his baby daughter for the first time. Such things are repeatedly said in his letters, as are general complaints about their hardships and their grueling daily activities.     While stationed on the island of Iwo Jima, the soldiers prepare for America's inevitable attack. They must do a multitude of tasks: digging trenches, hollowing out caves, arming weapons, etc. But what makes their situation even more difficult is the fairly low morale among the soldiers; despite their service to their country, despite believing that they will die honorably, many seem to know that they're fighting a losing battle; most of their forces have been destroyed, and they're clearly not readyto do battle on the island. It doesn't help that the soldiers are being served tainted water, causing widespread dysentery. After weeks of such conditions, many are willing to surrender the island to American forces. Saigo makes the mistake of suggesting this out loud as their hotheaded captain, Tanida (Takumi Bando), passes by. Apparently, saying such things is unpatriotic and disgraceful; he certainly makes this clear as he beats Saigo with a whip.    Then enters Kuribayashi, a levelheaded man of surprising emotional strength (as shown during scenes of letter writing to his unseen daughter). He notices Tanida's outburst and immediately points out that a good captain uses his brain, not just his whip. Already, this puts him at odds with other military officers, who begin to feel that he's better off behind a desk than commanding an army. They also grow increasingly suspicious of his proposed strategies; he believes that digging a trench along the beach is a waste of time, and that the soldiers should focus their attention on caves underneath the mountains. As the film progresses, feelings against the general rise, especially when they learn that he had spent some time in America.    Indeed, his feelings for the Americans are not as clear-cut as most of the other soldiers'. They were raised to believe that Americans were a weak, inferior people, easily succumbing to emotional impulses when out on the battlefield. By the time combat begins on the island, many Japanese soldiers realize that what they were taught to believe was wrong. There's an especially powerful scene in which the Japanese takes in a wounded American soldier. The superior officer orders that he be treated, not killed. His reasoning is simple: any one of his soldiers would do the same for him. \\"An American would never treat a Japanese soldier!\\" protests a young officer. \\"Have you ever met one?\\" is the commander's reply, which was a profound thing to say. The complex relationship between the opposingarmies grows deeper after the wounded soldier awakens; he and a Japanese soldier engage in a very cordial conversation.    If only the world's problems could be fixed that easily. Unfortunately, a war is raging, and not everyone is ready to put all differences aside. The Japanese know this all too well: their ammunition is rapidly dwindling, as is their food and water supply; reinforcements will not be sent; soldiers are dying left and right. Some soldiers resort to suicide, believing that they should die honorably as opposed to fighting a losing battle. A very graphic yet important scene shows a number of soldiers with hand grenades, activating them while holding them tightly to their chests. One can't help but question the mentality of anyone willing to die so needlessly, especially since they had the chance (albeit an incredibly slim one) of surviving the war and returning home.    At a certain point in the film, Saigo buries a sack full of unsent letters, none of which would be found until 2005, when a research team discovers them. A shot of the letters falling from the open sack is extremely poignant, with the voices of the soldiers overlapping one another. That scene in particular shows the greatest amount of humanity, and I thank the filmmakers for including it. Much like \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is not a film that glorifies war in any way; rather, it gives a face to the violence and bloodshed that was World War II, a face that we have rarely been given the chance to see. It was both brave and necessary for a war film to show America's \\"enemies\\" as human beings, with hopes, fears, and loves. For that reason alone, this film needs to be seen.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|I wouldn't exactly call it a departure album, since many of the songs have the same feel of past efforts, but there is something different about this collection of songs, a desire to expand her universe, experimenting with a little cabaret, reaching beyond her comfortable confines just enough to make one feel that she isn't at ease with herself.  This album isn't as light and breezy as was \\"Feels Like Home.\\"  There are hints of melancholy and a quiet sense of dispair on Wish I Could, but it quickly gives way to the playful Sinkin' Soon, even if it too seems to evoke a sense of impending doom.  The Sun Doesn't Like You is a bit mournful, but she returns to familiar ground on Until the End.  She is at her most poltical on My Dear Country, which seems to reflect her disappointment in Kerry's loss in 2004, while at the same time reaffirming her faith in the country.  After a reflective Wake Me Up When It's Over, she picks up the tempo on Be My Somebody.  Don't get too depressed, there is much to draw from on this album.  There is a wistful quality to the song selections, as if drawing the inspiration for this album from an old-time radio show, but I think Norah also wants to remind us of the uneasy times we currently live in.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The trailer to this movie caught my eye with its great cast, and intriguing premise.  I was excited to give this DVD a spin and see if it lived up to its expectations.  The movie itself was solidly entertaining, but not as good as I hoped.<br /><br />The Illusionist captures the feel of the Victorian era quite well, plunging you into Vienna at a time before World War I.  The camera work and overall look of the film captures a silent era feel, adding to the atmosphere, but not distracting too much.  The sound is especially immersive during the scenes where Eisenheim is performing his magic.<br /><br />For the most part the cast does a great job.  Edward Norton is very believable as Eisenheim, capturing the characters emotions as well as he theatrical nature when he is on stage.  Paul Giamatti plays the persistent police inspector as a man who admires the illusionist, but is forced to work against him.  Rufus Sewell plays the crown prince as a nasty villain you want to see get his just desserts.  The only weak link is Jessica Biel.  It could be my problem, but she didn't seem to fit into the period as much as the other actors did.  She seemed too contemporary, and pulled me out of the movie.<br /><br />The score by Philip Glass is also distracting.  At times it works well, at others it's meandering strings and piano caused me to focus on it instead of the film itself.  Neil Burger's direction is solid and he makes the movie work.  The script is simple, but entertaining.<br /><br />As a whole the movie keeps you entertained.  Some may find the ending of the film a bit disappointing, but keep in mind that the ride is what is important here.  The Illusionist didn't beguile me completely, but it's deceptions did pass the time.

006097625X|5.0|Scott McCloud's first task in this book is explaining<br /><br />how comics work: what are the mechanics of art and the<br /><br />functions of the human brain that make this form of story<br /><br />telling so popular?<br /><br />As often happens somebody explains something that you thought<br /><br />needs no explanation, the explaining opens up a whole new<br /><br />world. One part of the beauty of this book is that it makes<br /><br />comics a lot more fun to read. Another is that it tells us<br /><br />(or reminds us) that a medium-novels, poems, comics, plays,<br /><br />or whatever have structure. The structures may not be<br /><br />obvious, but they're there and they're learnable.<br /><br />So after you put this book down and start enjoying your<br /><br />new insights into -let's say- the funny pages, you auto-<br /><br />matically find yourself wondering. How do novels work? What<br /><br />about video games? Daytime soaps? Campy horror films?<br /><br />Now logically, any explication of any medium could do this<br /><br />job of brain-opening for you. But McCloud's brilliance is in<br /><br />using a very sexy medium to explain the very same medium. In<br /><br />this case the artist and the commentator are one. (chances<br /><br />are that you'll never read an epic poem that explains the<br /><br />way epic poems work).<br /><br />It also happens that McCloud is a master as both artist and<br /><br />commentator and the time you spend reading this book will<br /><br />be very pleasant indeed.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE and<br /><br />the forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN<br /><br />9781601640005

0684830515|5.0|On the dedication page, Hemingway quotes his friend Gertrude Stein: \\"You are all a lost generation.\\" This is followed by a quote from the Biblical Book of Ecclesiastics: \\"One generation paseth away, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth forever... The sun also ariseth...\\" <br /> <br />This book gets better with each reading--or maybe its because I've grown a little older and wearier myself along the way. It is a character study of a group of friends from a generation of young men and women who in the aftermath of World War I, in F. Scott Fitzgerald's words, have \\"grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken.\\" Hemingway sends a group of friends, American and British expatriates  living in Paris, on a trip to the Festival of San Fermin in Spain to party for a week of days and nights and to see the bullfights. Of the five of them--Jake, Brett, Bill, Mike and Robert Cohn--all but Cohn have been affected by WWI, and all but Cohn have become disconnected, disillusioned and apathetic. <br /> <br />After divorcing her husband who was driven to mental instability by his war experiences, Brett carelessly bounces from one man to another even as her new finance, Mike, is travelling with her to the festival. For his part, Mike is bankrupt and is bitter on many levels; he mostly accepts Brett as she is. Bill just doesn't care about much of anything except enjoying the here and now, and Jake is struggling with a most unfortunate war wound. They find the good things in small pleasures such as a wonderfully rendered fishing trip or a long evening of inebriation at a cafe.  <br /> <br />Only Cohn is unaffected by the War, and while he may be a bit of a twit he's basically a nice guy who keeps expecting people to behave decently and keeps being let down by this bunch of lost souls. Cohn has been among Brett's lovers and the friction created by her callousness towards him creates the dramatic fiber of the story. But it is Jake & Brett's affection for each other and the sad fact that they will never be able to consummate it that really provides the metaphor for the lost generation, rendered impotent by their experiences, sent spiraling off away from each other in different, aimless directions. <br /> <br />The festival itself, with its rich, colorful traditions and camaraderie is a great contrast with the disillusioned protagonists. Their disregard for the welfare of the very talented young bullfighter Pedro costs Jake a friendship with a fellow bullfighting aficionado and Jake doesn't really seem to care. He simply never did fully understand the passion devoted to the sport, although he tried. And yes, Brett sometimes teases men like a bullfighter taunting bulls to their deaths. <br /> <br />Some criticize this book as being about nothing but that isn't true at all. The people in it are careless but not without reason, and under the surface--watch the dialog and action carefully--there is great pain and struggle within them. The reader needs to bring some life experiences along for the ride to really get it. If you haven't experienced loss or disillusionment yourself it's hard to see what these characters are going on about and why they behave as they do. <br /> <br />Hemingway's famously minimalist prose provides a rich, colorfully detailed story while letting the characters speak for themselves. I can't imagine how tedious this story would be if the narrator were constantly trying to put these motives into words. Hemingway's great talent was in describing the dialog and action simply and yet still completely controlling his themes with grace and realism. The Sun Also Rises was and is landmark literature for its story and its prose style, and today it is also a revealing historical document about the time and the mood following the First World War.

The genius and insight of Lincoln is amazing. That and his ability to understand and size people up.

A can't miss book.  <br /> <br />The only negative is its length, and the time it takes to introduce each of the key players, but a book of this depth and insight has to be extensive. Don't let the size stop you. It's well worth the read. You will be a more educated and appreciative person for having read it.

1576462676|1.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen, is a book about the life of a girl, Elizabeth Bennet. She has five sisters and lives with her mother and father in 18th century England. The story tells of her sisters' loves and marriages. Elizabeth's youngest sister gets married to a man of questionable character, who happens to be the friend of the man that Elizabeth herself loves, Mr. Darcy. Of course Elizabeth's love isn't that simple, since she first has to hate Mr. Darcy and then blames him for everything that her sister is going through. Jane, Elizabeth's oldest sister, falls in love with another of Darcy's friends. All the trouble that any of Elizabeth's not-quite-normal family has is blamed on Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Basically, the whole book is about an 18th century girl whining about her upper middle class life. Of course, at the end, she gets exactly what she wants and everyone lives happily ever after. There is credit to be given to Jane Austen, since she wrote the book in an American household in the early 1800s, with no support from any of her family. She had to hide her writing under knitting or sewing whenever someone approached. She then had a friend publish the books she wrote, without telling her husband. Considering all that, the story really isn't that bad, but in general, if you were looking for a book by Jane Austen, Emma would be a better read. If you want a predictable love story, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a good book for you.
0060899190|5.0|When I discovered the PostSecret website I had no idea that the creator / founder had already published three collections of the postcards people have anonymously contributed to his website.<br /><br />As a refresher as to what PostSecret is: Frank Warren came up with the idea of having people anonymously send a postcard with a secret that is true and that has never been shared with anyone before. The postcard could be drawn up in any way to have the image reflect the secret being told in the text. Warren has a PostSecret website which he updates every Sunday with a new round of secrets. The secret can range from the painful (\\"I love one of my children\\") to the funny (\\"I would love to jump in a pool of Jell-O\\") to the sad and embarrassing and silly. But the common thread here is that they are all deeply personal and true for one person and reading through the secrets of other people it is clear that what may seem like a shameful secret that a person thinks nobody else has ever had is really something that is a common human emotion and a sadly common truth. Other people have gone through some of what these people are going through, and that's what makes PostSecret such a fascinating website because while it is a glimpse into the secret hearts of strangers, it is also a glimpse into our own.<br /><br />The above paragraph is tailored specifically to the website, but the collection PostSecret: Extraordinary Confessions from Ordinary Lives is a collection of secrets previously posted on the website and likely also shown in traveling PostSecret art exhibits. But the book can bring the secrets to a wider audience. Since I am very new to the world of PostSecret every secret contained in this collection was fresh and every one was fascinating and many rang true and others I could at least understand.<br /><br />Since Frank Warren appears to remove previous secrets from his website every Sunday when he adds new ones, this collection may also be the only way to see some \\"old favorites\\" again for those readers and viewers who have long been familiar with the concept of PostSecret.<br /><br />It's worth checking out.

B000I5X80G|5.0|Yes, we all realize there was much more to the show than 6 songs but none of us can do much about that.  The fact of the matter is the music is classic Neil Young with the incredible Crazy Horse blowing away the crowd.  Take the songs that were released and listen.  You may even smile a bit if, like myself, you saw the band on that 1970 tour.  Neil is a pretty strange dude but his musical brilliance is undeniable and one needs only to look at his 40+ years of recordings to understand the talent possessed by this legend.  He does it his way, always has and always will.  Deal with the reality that 6  songs is better than none and it's enough to remind us of his unique ability to write, sing and play.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Albeit Gore could address everything for there are many supporting issues that have been culminating to bring this whole sound picture to light. Not to mention how his person/delivery may get in the way for others to be able to hear his message. Understood, but that's sad. People don't throw out the Baby with the Bath water! Literally everyday now more things are comming to light that only further reinstate these views and understandings.<br />Here are some common myths and Facts on the subject from my fact finding I have found immutable...<br /><br />MYTH: The science of global warming is too uncertain to act on.<br />FACT: There is no debate among scientists about the basic facts of global warming.<br />The most respected scientific organizations have stated unequivocally that global warming is happening, and people are causing it by burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences, which in 2005 the White House called \\"the gold standard of objective scientific assessment,\\" issued a joint statement with 10 other National Academies of Science saying \\"the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action. It is vital that all nations identify cost-effective steps that they can take now, to contribute to substantial and long-term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions.\\" (Joint Statement of Science Academies: Global Response to Climate Change [PDF], 2005)<br />The only debate in the science community about global warming is about how much and how fast warming will continue as a result of heat-trapping emissions. In the case of global warming, scientists have given a clear warning, and we have more than enough facts to act on.<br /><br />MYTH: Global warming is just part of one of the earth's natural cycles.<br />FACT: The global warming we are experiencing is not natural. People are causing it by burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests. Scientists have shown that these activities are pumping far more carbon dioxide (C02) into the atmosphere than was ever released in hundreds of thousands of years. This buildup of CO2 is the biggest cause of global warming. (IPCC 2001) Since 1895, scientists have known that CO2 and other greenhouse gases trap heat and warm the earth. As the warming has intensified over the past three decades, scientific scrutiny has increased along with it. Scientists have considered and ruled out other natural explanations such as sunlight, volcanic eruptions and cosmic rays. (IPCC 2001)<br />Though natural amounts of CO2 vary from 180 to 300 parts per million (ppm), today's CO2 levels are around 380 ppm. That's 25% more than the highest natural levels, looking back 650,000 years. Increased CO2 levels have corresponded with higher average temperatures throughout that long record. (Boden, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center)<br /><br />MYTH: As the ozone hole shrinks, global warming will no longer be a problem.<br />FACT: Global warming and the ozone hole are different problems. The ozone hole is a thinning of the stratosphere's ozone layer, which is roughly 9 to 31 miles above the earth's surface. The depletion of the ozone is due to man-made chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). A thinner ozone layer lets more harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach the earth's surface.<br />Global warming, on the other hand, is the increase in the earth's average temperature due to the buildup of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities.<br /><br />MYTH: We can adapt to climate change--civilization has survived droughts and ice ages before.<br />FACT: Individual civilizations have collapsed from dramatic climatic shifts.<br />Although humans as a whole have survived the vagaries of drought, ice ages and more, not every society has. What's more, unless we limit the amount of heat-trapping gases we are putting into the atmosphere, we will face a warming trend unseen since human civilization began 10,000 years ago. (IPCC 2001) The consequences of continued warming at current rates are likely to be dire. Many densely populated areas, such as low-lying coastal regions, are highly vulnerable to climate shifts. A middle-of-the-range projection is that the homes of 13 to 88 million people around the world would be flooded by the sea each year in the 2080s. Poorer countries and small island nations will have the hardest time adapting. (McLean et al. 2001) In what appears to be the first forced move resulting from climate change, 100 residents of Tegua island in the Pacific Ocean were evacuated by the government because rising sea levels were flooding their island. Some 2,000 other islanders plan a similar move to escape rising waters.<br />Scarcity of water and food could lead to major conflicts with broad ripple effects throughout the globe. Even if people find a way to adapt, the wildlife and plants on which we depend may be unable to adapt to rapid climate change. While the world itself will not end, the world as we know it may disappear.<br /><br />MYTH: Even if global warming is a problem, addressing it will hurt American industry and workers.<br />FACT: A well designed trading program will harness American ingenuity to decrease heat-trapping pollution cost-effectively, jumpstarting a new carbon economy.<br />Claims that fighting global warming will cripple the economy and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs are unfounded. In fact, companies that are already reducing their heat-trapping emissions have discovered that cutting pollution can save money. The cost of a comprehensive national greenhouse gas reduction program will depend on the precise emissions targets, the timing for the reductions and the means of implementation. An independent MIT study found that a modest cap-and-trade system would cost less than $20 per household annually and have no negative impact on employment.<br />Experience has shown that properly designed emissions trading programs can reduce compliance costs significantly compared with other regulatory approaches. For example, the U.S. acid rain program reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 30 percent from 1990 levels and cost industry a fraction of what the government originally estimated, according to EPA. Furthermore, a mandatory cap on emissions could spur technological innovation that could create jobs and wealth. Letting global warming continue until we are forced to address it on an emergency basis could disrupt and severely damage our economy. It is far wiser and more cost-effective to act now.<br /><br />MYTH: Water vapor is the most important, abundant greenhouse gas. So if we're going to control a greenhouse gas, why don't we control it instead of carbon dioxide (CO2)?<br />FACT: Although water vapor traps more heat than CO2, because of the relationships among CO2, water vapor and climate, to fight global warming nations must focus on controlling CO2.<br />Atmospheric levels of CO2 are determined by how much coal, natural gas and oil we burn and how many trees we cut down, as well as by natural processes like plant growth. Atmospheric levels of water vapor, on the other hand, cannot be directly controlled by people; rather, they are determined by temperatures. The warmer the atmosphere, the more water vapor it can hold.  As a result, water vapor is part of an amplifying effect. Greenhouse gases like CO2 warm the air, which in turn adds to the stock of water vapor, which in turn traps more heat and accelerates warming. Scientists know this because of satellite measurements documenting a rise in water vapor concentrations as the globe has warmed.<br />The best way to lower temperature and thus reduce water vapor levels is to reduce CO2 emissions.<br /><br />MYTH: Global warming and extra CO2 will actually be beneficial -- they reduce cold-related deaths and stimulate crop growth.<br />FACT: Any beneficial effects will be far outweighed by damage and disruption. Even a warming in just the middle range of scientific projections would have devastating impacts on many sectors of the economy. Rising seas would inundate coastal communities, contaminate water supplies with salt and increase the risk of flooding by storm surge, affecting tens of millions of people globally. Moreover, extreme weather events, including heat waves, droughts and floods, are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity, causing loss of lives and property and throwing agriculture into turmoil.<br />Even though higher levels of CO2 can act as a plant fertilizer under some conditions, scientists now think that the \\"CO2 fertilization\\" effect on crops has been overstated; in natural ecosystems, the fertilization effect can diminish after a few years as plants acclimate. Furthermore, increased CO2 may benefit undesirable, weedy species more than desirable species.<br />Higher levels of CO2 have already caused ocean acidification, and scientists are warning of potentially devastating effects on marine life and fisheries. Moreover, higher levels of regional ozone (smog), a result of warmer temperatures, could worsen respiratory illnesses. Less developed countries and natural ecosystems may not have the capacity to adapt.<br />The notion that there will be regional \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\" in global warming is based on a world-view from the 1950's. We live in a global community.  Never mind the moral implications -- when an environmental catastrophe creates millions of refugees half-way around the world, Americans are affected.<br /><br />MYTH: Global warming is just part of a natural cycle. The Arctic has warmed up in the past.<br />FACT: The global warming we are experiencing is not natural. People are causing it.<br />People are causing global warming by burning fossil fuels (like oil, coal and natural gas) and cutting down forests. Scientists have shown that these activities are pumping far more CO2 into the atmosphere than was ever released in hundreds of thousands of years. This buildup of CO2 is the biggest cause of global warming. Since 1895, scientists have known that CO2 and other greenhouse gases trap heat and warm the earth. As the warming has intensified over the past three decades, scientific scrutiny has increased along with it. Scientists have considered and ruled out other, natural explanations such as sunlight, volcanic eruptions and cosmic rays. (IPCC 2001)<br />Though natural amounts of CO2 have varied from 180 to 300 parts per million (ppm), today's CO2 levels are around 380 ppm. That's 25% more than the highest natural levels over the past 650,000 years. Increased CO2 levels have contributed to periods of higher average temperatures throughout that long record. (Boden, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center)<br />As for previous Arctic warming, it is true that there were stretches of warm periods over the Arctic earlier in the 20th century. The limited records available for that time period indicate that the warmth did not affect as many areas or persist from year to year as much as the current warmth. But that episode, however warm it was, is not relevant to the issue at hand. Why? For one, a brief regional trend does not discount a longer global phenomenon.<br />We know that the planet has been warming over the past several decades and Arctic ice has been melting persistently. And unlike the earlier periods of Arctic warmth, there is no expectation that the current upward trend in Arctic temperatures will reverse; the rising concentrations of greenhouse gases will prevent that from happening.<br /><br />MYTH: Recent cold winters and cool summers don't feel like global warming to me.<br />FACT: While different pockets of the country have experienced some cold winters here and there, the overall trend is warmer winters.<br />Measurements show that over the last century the Earth's climate has warmed overall, in all seasons, and in most regions. Climate skeptics mislead the public when they claim that the winter of 2003-2004 was the coldest ever in the northeastern United States. That winter was only the 33rd coldest in the region since records began in 1896. Furthermore, a single year of cold weather in one region of the globe is not an indication of a trend in the global climate, which refers to a long-term average over the entire planet.<br /><br />MYTH: Global warming can't be happening because some glaciers and ice sheets are growing, not shrinking.<br />FACT: In most parts of the world, the retreat of glaciers has been dramatic. The best available scientific data indicate that Greenland's massive ice sheet is shrinking.<br />Between 1961 and 1997, the world's glaciers lost 890 cubic miles of ice. The consensus among scientists is that rising air temperatures are the most important factor behind the retreat of glaciers on a global scale over long time periods. Some glaciers in western Norway, Iceland and New Zealand have been expanding during the past few decades. That expansion is a result of regional increases in storm frequency and snowfall rather than colder temperatures -- not at all incompatible with a global warming trend.<br />In Greenland, a NASA satellite that can measure the ice mass over the whole continent has found that although there is variation from month to month, over the longer term, the ice is disappearing. In fact, there are worrisome signs that melting is accelerating: glaciers are moving into the ocean twice as fast as a decade ago, and, over time, more and more glaciers have started to accelerate. What is most alarming is the prediction, based on model calculations and historical evidence, that an approximately 5.4 degree Fahrenheit increase in local Greenland temperatures will lead to irreversible meltdown and a sea-level rise of over 20 feet. Since the Arctic is warming 2-3 times faster than the global average, this tipping point is not far away.<br />The only study that has shown increasing ice mass in Greenland only looked at the interior of the ice sheet, not at the edges where melting occurs. This is actually in line with climate model predictions that global warming would lead to a short-term accumulation of ice in the cold interior due to heavier snowfall. (Similarly, scientists have predicted that Antarctica overall will gain ice in the near future due to heavier snowfall.) The scientists who published the study were careful to point out that their results should not be used to conclude that Greenland's ice mass as a whole is growing. In addition, their data suggested that the accumulation of snow in the middle of the continent is likely to decrease over time as global warming continues.<br /><br />MYTH: Accurate weather predictions a few days in advance are hard to come by. Why on earth should we have confidence in climate projections decades from now?<br />FACT: Climate prediction is fundamentally different from weather prediction, just as climate is different from weather. It is often more difficult to make an accurate weather forecast than a climate prediction. The accuracy of weather forecasting is critically dependent upon being able to exactly and comprehensively characterize the present state of the global atmosphere. Climate prediction relies on other, longer ranging factors. For instance, we might not know if it will be below freezing on a specific December day in New England, but we know from our understanding of the region's climate that the temperatures during the month will generally be low. Similarly, climate tells us that Seattle and London tend to be rainy, Florida and southern California are usually warm, and the Southwest is often dry and hot.<br />Today's climate models can now reproduce the observed global average climates over the past century and beyond. Such findings have reinforced scientist's confidence in the capacity of models to produce reliable projections of future climate. Current climate assessments typically consider the results from a rangeof models and scenarios for future heat-trapping emissions in order to identify the most likely range for future climatic change.<br /><br />P.S.

0385512058|5.0|This book is incredible!  I read through the book in less than 2 days and then went back and read it again at a slower pace to simply absorb the information presented.  Keith does an outstanding job of highlighting the importance of networking and reaching out to help others.  Many of us want to network and don't know how and this book offers the solution.  Still, there are many others that already have a large network in place but don't realize it and Keith illustrates the necessity to reach out and ask for help when you need it.  This book is very motivating and enlightening.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in expanding their network or making the most of the network they have in place.
0552151696|1.0|Looking at the cover's title \\"best seller\\" and the rave reviews from various critics you'd think it would be at least a decent book to read.  The ridiculous plot was filled with incompetent blobs wearing genious tags in the ultimate super secret government agency protecting our vital interests.  There was no depth to this plot.  The information within would probably suffice for an elementary school reader.  I didn't even bother reading the last few pages after the plot turned out to be a joke.  This was my first book by Dan Brown and probably the last.
B0002O7XWC|3.0|Ok so in 35 years there is still no director's cut? I've heard that this version we all know and love of easy rider is only about 40% of what was the original director's cut. If someone is going to put out a special edition, then supposing we finally see a second disk with the 3 or so hours of deleted scenes? And I mean- a director's cut movie, not just a bunch of isolated deleted scenes. Also, if you're going to add bonus soundtrack items, how about including the Hendrix tune from the movie, which I think is about the only one i remember from the movie that is not in the original movie soundtrack lp. But.. besides me wanting to know what the other 3 hours was like, this movie is all time classic independent american cinema and highly recommended to anyone over 18. It has great performances by many folks down to the louisiana locals who were used to make the movie more authentic. The trip scene was bizare for its time and arguably even for today, but very relatable, if you are 'experienced'. The scenery is absolutely stunning (watch it in WIDEscreen). And it's a great look at a country polarized by cultures and an unpopular war (sound familiar?) Buy the movie but save on the 'extras' till the 'extras' means the whole 4+ hours movie.

0060989157|5.0|I hurt my back this summer and my sis brought over several rock books (GNR, The Cure, U2 etc...from our youth.  We weren't huge Motley fans UNTIL we read the book.  Having done every drug on the planet, we could so feel the thrill when Nikki discussed his drugging, the fear when Nikki OD'd and the pain when they all cleaned up.  And then when sober coming out with \\"The Doctor\\".  F..ing awesome.  And then finding out I have the same disease as Mick.....I have so much respect for the guy.  If you watch Carnival of Sins, you know he's hurting...but he rules.  If you like this I suggest you get the DVD of their Best of Videos and watch the Nikki/Tommy interview.  And as always Nikki somehow gets hotter by the day.   <br />Also read 'Up and Down with the Rolling Stones' by t. sanchez.  Keith and Nikki are so similar--- it's uncanny (Keith was also very hot until about '93). And both weren't really known as the master song/music writers.  And the fact that some of their best work was on smack and overcoming it all and selling out stadiums with awesome music........  Ti & Jen
0743455967|4.0|I was skeptical at first as to how good this one would be.  I really, truly enjoyed it!  This is the book Stephen was writing when he was hit by the van.  He has been very generous with advice and, as always, that King charm.  A very good book if you want to see into the mind of a master.
B0000640VN|5.0|So one of the movies I saw recently when I was in Seattle was Kate and Leopold.  It's an old movie, and I actually like old movies a lot. <br />The reason I like old movies so much is that it lets me verify whether I'm watching a good movie.  Sometimes, when a new movie is released, it's hard to tell if it's any good because the publicity about it makes me want to see it, and it's hard to tell in that moment whether it's any good.  Whereas, when the movie is old, if the jokes are bad, and the plot is stupid, it shows. <br /> <br />A lot of people think Kate and Leopold was a cheesy movie, but I liked it for several reasons.  Although Meg Ryan was a disappointment because she played herself, or the same character in You've Got Mail, I thought Hugh Jackman was impressive because he acted differently than Wolverine.  Well of course we all expected him to act differently than Wolverine in Xmen, but sometimes people play themselves and are not able to adapt to new roles very well.  Jackman did a great job of acting like a knight in shining armor, even though he probably is one in real life.
0743289412|3.0|Of course it's well written.  It's King.  BUT if you are an avid King reader as I am, you well know that some of his books are a bit slow and you just have to bear with them.  Lisey's Story is a good book but if you want your eyes to stay riveted to the pages, go read The Dark Tower Series.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|If you are into cerebral quick witted dialog then you will enjoy this <br />television show.  I never saw it when it was televised.  It was recommended to me after I expressed my enjoyment over Studio City on the Sunset Strip.  Aaron Sorkin is a genius.  This is quality programming!!
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Being a music lover, I've often purchased a new artist's CD based on one hit song.  Most of the time that's the only song on the album worth listening to, but sometimes I get lucky.  This was the case with Taylor Swift.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed every single song on the album.  Her voice is beautiful, and she doesn't try to portray herself as someone much older or more sophisticated.  The songs took me back to my high-school years and the emotions we all felt.  Everyone I've played the album for has enjoyed it, and I listen to it a lot more than I do a lot of other artists.  Taylor's emotions run deep and she has the skill to put them into words that hit home.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed!
B000929AJQ|5.0|this cd is a complete 360 back to an old style. This album sounds closer to Pretty Hate Machine than any other NIN record but at the same time not quite. Yes this cd will dissapoint NIN fans that are looking for the anger, and the hardcore sound Trent is known for but dont think for one second that this album dosent have the energy or production quality of past albums. This is a new NIN, a new direction, a new(ish) sound. This is Trent matureing because of this one fact, his old fans are also matureing. For first time listeners, youll like this album and all it has to offer, but for past fans, sit there and listen to it a few times and it will grow on you when you notice theres tons going on in the background that you didnt notice the first time arround. this is a nice trip to a revamped old style that makes for an amazing listen. I honestlly beleve the best is yet to come with this new direction, simply put this album is Trent growing up along with his older fanbase.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie happens to be about two guys who are gay, but there are important and powerful messages in the movie that apply to everyone, regardless of sexual preference.    Each of the characters is in denial, and tries to live the life that society, or his parents, or he himself, thinks he should live.    In the end, failing to live their real life results in a destruction of their \\"pretend\\" lives.    While the main characters here are gay, there are millions of heterosexual (and I'm sure many married) people who have a secret love affair and meet clandestinely every once in a while.    The novel and movie illustrates that in the end, living a life that isn't your true self will destroy you.  The scenery is breathtaking, and the acting, while at times a little contrived, is really well done.      Beautiful movie.  Everyone should ask themselves whether they're living the life they should be living.  And if the answer is \\"no\\", then you should be brave enough to do whatever it takes to be true to yourself.

B000094HMU|5.0|I watch a lot of opera on DVD, and there's usually some element of each performance that doesn't quite match the others.  Perhaps it's a singer who isn't on par with his or her cast members, or -- more likely these days -- the design and/or directorial \\"concept\\" is anachronistic and distracting.  But there's absolutely nothing -- and I mean nothing -- that doesn't work about this Met \\"Turandot.\\"  One can quibble perhaps with the scope of Zeffirelli's production, but for once his obsession with size pays off.  This is an Asian fairytale, and the design is appropriately fantastical.  (I actually recommend that, if you get the chance, you see this production in the house, as it has to be experienced live to be believed.)  And the VOICES!!  I was leery about Marton and Mitchell, as I haven't always loved their work in the past; but they're brilliant.  As is Mr. Domingo, whom I've always loved.  To be honest, \\"Nessun Dorma\\" doesn't quite explode the way it should, but I've rarely heard him in better voice.  All in all, I cannot imagine a better \\"Turandot\\" on DVD.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Maybe I have this wrong... I'll have to review the footage... but in the final scene at the night club did they get the wrong guy? Did anyone else notice this? I think I saw the actual rapist standing and watching the events unfold with a smirk on his face. At least I think it was him. That would be the ultimate irony in this disturbing but amazing film.  <br /> <br />

0792164903|5.0|Well, I bought this movie about 7 years ago..around the time when it came out and I just watched it again and I think I had forgotten how great it was! It definitely has a little twist from Washington Irving's \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\"...but a good one. It constantly has me on the edge of my seat...and laughing. That about it sums it up, a good, scary, funny movie all in one...couldn't ask for more. I definitely recommend this, it's fun for everyone to watch, no matter what your age is. (Johnny Depp is good for those type of movies, by the way, so you should look into more of them)
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I cannot find a fault with this movie. The music is fantastic. Judy Garland is at her peak. Vincente Minnelli balances story and visuals. The sountrack alone is worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />The bonus features are excellent as well. A look back at the history of MGM seen through eyes of the period of her greatest hour of need (the early 1970s) and documentary on the making of the film are priceless. The trip through Judy's career via her movie trailers is a trip worth taking. For all that MGM did wrong, including its mistreatment of Judy Garland, they did manage to produce the greatest musicals of all time. <br /> <br />If you're not a fan of Judy Garland when the film starts, you'll be more than a fan by the end; you'll be in love with her. Vincente Minnelli had this experience with this movie and so will you. <br />
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I have read all of the reviews of this album...and many are right on the mark...great-no, more like fantastic CD...seems to bridge two types of music...punk and rock...and the lyrics come across as very real... <br /> <br />99% of the time I listen to my 8 GB iPod nano in my car...but these two CD's -- Saliva (Blood Stained Love Story) and Rise Against (The Sufferer and the Witness)... haven't even made it inside my house to get downloaded into iTunes...they are that good... <br /> <br />If you don't own this CD, you are missing out! <br /> <br />I am looking forward to the next Rise Against CD...
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The sounds of the Beatles catalog remixed and remastered is worth the cost of this CD/DVD. The greatest catalog of music in pop history needs to be remastered and re-released. George Martin gives us a taste of what that will be like when it eventually happens. <br /> <br />Sure we've heard these songs 847 times each. Sure we probably own every released, re-released and bootleg song the Beatles have ever recorded. But you have never heard these tracks this way. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" in true stereo with a remixed vocal begs for the rest of the catalog to get the same treatment. Lennon's guitar on \\"Get Back\\" comes to life on this disc. <br /> <br />I've read that 130 songs are represented in this project. I can't verify that, but I can say that whatever the count, George Martin deserves a great big Thank-You from Beatles' fans for giving us at least this project. <br /> <br />George Martin needs to get with Paul McCartney and give the whole catalog the remastering treatment! I bought this disc, you know I'm ready to buy the remastered orginals!

Well everyone I know, I guess just hit the spot.! \\"SAW 2\\" was good, I liked it too, But not like the first SAW, But this SAW 3 is kind of looks like a lots flash backs and getting little lame and drama type the flick, I guess really wasn't all that like first saw & saw2, A bit downfall to me. The \\"SAW\\" series is kind of like \\"HOSTEL\\" scrip.  Well \\"HOSTEL 2\\" going to release in theaters soon, Hope they NOT going to screw it up like they did with this SAW3!!I bought first SAW & 2 on DVD ...But this \\"SAW3\\" is ok rental instead to Buy!!

B000GFLE1S|4.0|Charlie Price thought he escaped Northampton and the family business when he and his fiance moved to London. But when he father dies, he must take over the reigns at the Price & Company shoe factory, which has been in the family for three generations. But the place is hemorrhaging and soon he is forced to make people redundant. What he needs his plucky employee Lauren (who is about to be fired) tells him is to change the product. His eyebrow-less fiance Nicola would rather he sold the building and move on. But Charlie doesn't want the factory to fold under his watch.<br /><br />When Charlie travels to London, he comes across a lady being mugged, only to find that he's no lady, but rather a drag queen named Lola, who has a bugger of a time finding stiletto's that fit a man's foot just right. Soon an odd friendship is formed, when Charlie realizes his niche market and proposes to create a line of kinky boots for men who dress as women. Lola travels to Northampton to oversee design of the shoes that the factory will produce for the upcoming Milan show. To keep from standing out, he dons the clothing from his alter ego, Simon.<br /><br />Loosely based on a true story, \\"Kinky Boots\\" is a hysterical and sentimental story about a town banding together to achieve the company's destiny.  Superb casting including the outstanding Chiwetel Elijofor as Lola/Simon (who does his own singing) makes this more than just another British import. The DVD extras are pretty basic, but include a look at the actual shoe factory the story was based on, as well as the construction of a shoe.

I myself look forward to hearing much much more from you in the years to come. CARRY ON!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|That's how Al Gore introduces himself when he begins his presentation. With this film, Al Gore has made an impact on American society that he never could have with hundreds of speeches. Long known as a passionate advocate for doing something about global warning before it's too late, Gore has criss-crossed the country speaking to groups about the irrefutable scientific evidence supporting the idea that greenhouse gasses are going to cause serious disruption on the planet in the not-too-distant future. This documentary captures his lecture from beginning to end, while skillfully weaving in details about Gore's personal life. The scenes when he talks about his family's tobacco farm and his sister's death from lung cancer are particularly poignant. Interspersed in the credits are a number of simple, practical ideas anyone can follow to contribute in a tiny way to the solution. What a lot of consciousness-raising Gore has accomplished! <br /> <br />As I watched this film, I wondered if Gore, like Jimmy Carter, is destined to make his mark on America in a way far more effectively than he would have done as a successful politician.And of course, comparisons to the White House's current occupant are inevitable. Gore is one smart guy--if only. . . . .
B000KCHZK6|2.0|I just bought this album a few days ago and enjoyed 2 songs out of 13 on the album.  The lyrics are boring and not catchy at all. I let the whole album play and it just became more like background noice.  This is nothing compared to her old album \\"Come Away with me.\\"  There are two good songs on the album, which I suggest you should just purchase the singles of the two songs, if possible.  The first song \\"I've been thinking about you,\\" has a very catchy beat and good lyrics.  The second song I like on the album is \\"Rosemary's lullaby,\\" which pulls you in when you hear the lyrics and the beat.  However, as stated before, the rest of the album became like background noise.
B000002OAZ|5.0|I've often heard that \\"blues purists\\" have great disdain for this album, which leads me to think the definition of \\"blues purist\\" is \\"someone who tries way too hard to not like good music.\\" <br /> <br />Sure, Wolf was old. Sure, you can tell he wasn't in great health. But he was still perfectly able to get a song over and still had ample power upon which to draw when he needed to. The performances by the backing musicians (particularly Ian Stewart) are generally impeccable, the arrangements are tasteful if at times a bit cluttered, and Eric Clapton manages to walk the fine line between showcasing his own chops and not stepping on the toes of Wolf or his material. I think he pulls it off splendidly. <br /> <br />My only two complaints about this album are A) The Steve Winwood organ solo on \\"Who's Been Talking\\" (more '60s psychedelia than Chicago blues, sounds out of place), and the criminal relegation of the great Hubert Sumlin to (barely audible) rhythm guitar duties. This is like asking Michelangelo to paint tract houses, and the album would have benefited if Clapton and Sumlin both played lead guitar. <br /> <br />Aside from those fairly minor gripes, there's not really anything to dislike about this album if you enjoy listening to great musicians play great music. Highly recommended.
0143036556|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Well written. Lots of viewpoints, knowledges and good examples.
B000002OCP|1.0|My opinion of this album has nothing to do with being a \\"blues purist\\" as other reviewers have posited. It's a simple matter of good music vs. horrible music. Electric Mud is horrible music. It was intended as a fusion of Chicago blues and late 60s psychedelia, but it manages to mangle both genres equally. It doesn't help that Muddy's vocals sound disinterested and at times confused (as if he's subconsciously asking \\"How the hell did I get myself into THIS?\\"), or that the mix makes him sound like he's being recorded from a phone booth three miles away. <br /> <br />If Electric Mud has any value, it's as an object lesson in just how embarrassingly horrid a great artist and great songs can be made to sound. Not only would I never recommend that anyone spend their money on it, but if someone tries to give you a free copy, tell them no thanks.
1400064287|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish!  Immediately started applying many of the ideas to my non-profit organization with much success.  I found the breadth and scope of the subject matter to be especially interesting and fresh.   Thought the anecdotes were telling and fun.  Cannot say enough good things.  Just a really fun, interesting read that has already made a significant difference to my organization.
B0009VRHLK|4.0|If you love acting and original writing you will enjoy this film. It is extremely unique. If you have a closed mind or no interest in intimate film making,character, or story you probably won't understand it. If you have ever been in love,lost love,or had a drastic occurence stuck in your mind this film will hit home. This movie cannot be compared to ANY other movie.That's one big reason it is worth viewing. <br /> <br />

B000H6SXMY|2.0|It is a great idea to put all of the FRIENDS seasons into one series! I love FRIENDS, I think it is the best show ever made.  However, this product was confusing and I am very surprised by the way it was put together.  The discs were labeled by number of discs without any recognition of what Season is on it and what episodes I could find.  Not to mention the fact that some discs had the end of one season and the begining of the next on it.  There should have been some kind of order to the discs, as well as the season number on the discs so that I dont have to calculate disc 20 and what episodes will be on it and what sesaon that may be.  I was very disappointed and I, therefore, returned this package.  I refuse to have to look at the book every time I want to watch a specific episode.

The book is too.  That's the point.

B000FA57RG|1.0|This DVD is so bad that the company canned the idea of releasing it by itself, so they decided to release it with the album.  I saw this \\"documentary\\" when it was on TV. Madonna and her new \\"English\\" accent and \\"I'm better than you attitude\\" has finally gotten on my last nerve. She used to be a DIVA, now she is just and old preachy hen who wants to shove her Kabalah ways down her fans thoats! Face it, her glory days are long gone and it is only her die hard fans who still hold on to her \\"Blonde Ambition\\" days who still seem to think she is any good. She has not released a great song in years! <br /> <br />There is a scene where her daughter tries to talk just like her mother. She rants on and on, just like Madonna that all of a sudden Roco, Madonna's son, tells his sister to shut up! Well done, now he just needs to tell his mother the same thing!

B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is a Friends-like comedy about five twentysomethings (Lily, Marshall, Ted, Robin, and Barney) in New York. Lily, a kindergarten teacher, and Marshall, an aspiring attorney, have been together for the last nine years and in the first episode they become engaged. Ted, an architect and Marshall's roommate and best friend, has been looking at their perfect relationship for the last nine years and decides that it's time for him to find his own someone special. Barney, who wears suits just about everywhere, is Ted's other best friend and the most hilarious character on the show. And finally Robin, a tv news reporter, just joins the group when Ted decides that she might be the one.<br /><br />The story is told from Ted's point of view and the show is basically a love story in reverse. In the year 2030, Ted is telling two teenagers the story of how he met their mother beginning with the escapades he and his friends had in the year 2005. The five of them hang out at MacLaren's (their Central Perk) and try to navigate planning a wedding, finding a soul mate, and having legendary moments on a day to day basis. Each episode brings us closer to finding out who the \\"mother\\" is, but it's left to the viewer to wonder if the woman in question is Ted's wife or if these are even his kids.<br /><br />How I Met Your Mother is easily one of the funniest shows on television right now. Each episode is full of hilarious one-liners, and Barney's lines alone are enough to make you laugh out loud. I don't know how I missed this show the first time around, but I'm grateful it's on DVD. If you're in the mood for easy laughs with witty humor, I'd definitely recommend How I Met Your Mother.
B00008V5VN|1.0|I loved 'holy mountain' but really this sucks, long, repetitive and requiring chemical support to listen to.

B000004727|4.0|I found this album while searching for spanish flamenco guitar music and was not disappointed. Since then, I've heard other flamenco guitarists and De Lucia stands alone. His strings sound like rubber as he gracefully, yet powerfully, plays in delicate bursts that still leave me astounded by the enchanted beauty of espana. Every now and then there will come a guitar phrase that blows my mind and this was just what I was looking for. This feeling doesn't stick with me, though. I'm not in Spain and De Lucia is a somewhat cheesy for my taste, but he's probably one of the very best.
B000GG4XJM|3.0|Why couldn't these extra songs have been made available for purchase on Springsteen's official website, where one could download them onto their computer through iTunes or any other system of the like?  Springsteen and his team would still be able to receive their royalties and such, while fans would not have to put-out $20 for 14 tracks that they already own from the original We Shall Overcome album. And should anyone incorrectly believe my idea to be \\"revolutionary\\", I should point out that many musicians/bands are already doing this and have been doing this for the past few years or so. <br /> <br />In short, I love the bonus material hands-down, but I also feel that Springsteen's label, Columbia Records, could have approached this in a way that wouldn't cost as much money for his fans. <br />
B000M4RG42|4.0|Director:  Clint Eastwood <br />Cast:  Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, Adam Beach, John Benjamin Hickey, John Slatterly, Barry Pepper, Jamie Bell, Paul Walker, Robert Patrick. <br />Running Time: 132 minutes <br />Rated R for sequences of graphic war violence and carnage, and for language. <br /> <br />Whoever said \\"Truth is often the first casualty of war\\" must have had \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" in mind, the powerful new film from director Clint Eastwood that vividly juxtaposes the reality of the battlefield with the fantasy of the home front.  The movie tells the behind-the-scenes story of the picture-seen-round-the-world, the one showing the Marines raising the American flag triumphantly on Iwo Jima. When that photograph hit the nation's newspapers in early 1945, it provided not only a renewed feeling of hope to a nation weary of war, but a perfect PR opportunity for a government desperate to raise badly needed funds for the (pardon the pun) flagging war effort. Even though it was little known at the time that the photo the world saw was actually of the second raising of the flag (hence, the later charge that the whole thing was staged), the military pulled the three surviving men in the picture off the battlefield so that they could participate in a carefully choreographed, whirlwind tour designed to raise bond money back home. The romantic mythology that sprang up around the event so quickly embedded itself into the American consciousness that these self-described Regular Joes achieved an instant legendary hero status that they were not prepared for psychologically. The film explores the effect all this unlooked-for fame and publicity had on the men at the time and the way in which the label of \\"hero\\" haunted them for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br />Using James Bradley and Ron Powers' book as his source, scenarist Paul Haggis - whose recent work includes the superb \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" and the stylishly intelligent \\"Crash\\" - has written (with co-author William Broyles Jr.) a screenplay that deftly examines the nature of heroism and shows how truth is often sacrificed in the service of patriotism. That is pretty heady stuff in a day and age when charges of treason or at least of not supporting the troops are carelessly hurled at people who so much as question the wisdom of a particular war-related strategy or goal. And it is also surprising coming from a director like Eastwood, long associated with the more conservative elements in Hollywood. Yet, \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is a highly patriotic film in that it implies that we honor the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform the most when we adhere to the truth and don't try to manipulate the facts to suit our own purposes, no matter how noble those purposes might be. <br /> <br />The filmmakers have divided the film into three interlocking parts: the first is a brilliantly staged war-is-hell recreation of the island battle; the second documents the bond tour; and the third involves present day interviews with the survivors reflecting back on their experiences.  The battle scenes, which combine amazing CGI effects with sepia-toned photography, have the same stunning force as those in \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" No less impressive are the performances by a large and gifted cast, including Barry Pepper, Paul Walker and John Benjamin Hickey. In relatively minor roles As the three young men who feel unworthy of the title \\"hero,\\" Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and especially Adam Beach, as a Native American affectionately referred to as \\"Chief,\\" turn in superlative work.  As usual, Eastwood knows how to employ images for emotional impact: the combat sequences are brutal and relentless (and given Steven Spielberg produced the film, comparisons with Saving Private Ryan's gut-wrenching opening battle are a bit inevitable), and thanks to the cast's affecting, unpretentious performances (most notably Beach and Barry Pepper, who gives a memorable turn as the platoon leader) the movie never stops being a relevant, powerful piece of work. The only part where the director risks losing the audience's attention (and that's pretty bad, since he hasn't gained it yet) is the slightly confusing beginning, which consists of a series of intertwined flashbacks, which feel pretty pointless considering they're repeated, in their extended form, throughout the film. The other complaint one can come up with is related to the running time: had Eastwood avoided playing certain scenes more than once, the movie would have been more fluid and accessible. \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" may not be Eastwood's best picture, but it certainly deserves to be mentioned among the high points of his career, and makes it worth waiting for his companion piece \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", which tells the same story from the Japanese point of view.  <br />
B0000640SB|2.0|Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are great actors, but not in this film.  \\"Men in Black\\" is about as realistic as winning the lottery every day for a week.  On the good side, its violence is not to be taken seriously, and it probably is a great family show for those with 6-10 year-old children.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|I purchased this movie because my son had just finished reading \\"The Curious Incident of a Dog in the Night\\", and he made comments about the boys math skills.  I suggested he watch Rain Man, it has funny moments and interesting look at how someone's life can change.  After watching it again I got much more out of it.
0563486430|4.0|The book reads just like an episode on television, which is both good and bad. GOOD, in that it basically captures the spirit of the show and gives the characters an adventure with a few close calls, puzzles to figure out, and timelines to cross. BAD, in that this isn't a television show -- it's a book.<br /><br />See, the best thing about novelizations is that they let you explore things that movies or TV episodes can't -- emotions, thoughts, motivations, etc. A book is a great chance to get to know the characters better: to insert memories, to demonstrate how they reason and think their way through events, to explore how what's happening affects them and why, to delve into their feelings for other characters. All the kinds of things that are difficult to show on TV, but which really fill out a novel, adding depth and texture and interest.<br /><br />It appears to be aimed more at young adults than the adult crowd, which is fine, so long as you're not expecting anything deep or meaningful. No plunges into the inner workings of the Doctor's mind or examinations of his relationship with Rose, here. Basically, it's a good book with an interesting storyline, plenty of trouble for Rose and the Doctor to get into, and even a brief tour of ancient Rome. The characterization wasn't perfect, and it seemed a rather simplified adventure, even with all that happens. But that works very well for the younger readers it's written for.<br /><br />\\"The Stone Rose\\" is worth buying and worth reading. I give 4 stars, only because it does lack the depth I expected from a novelization. Other than that, it's a fine book!
038073186X|4.0|I love Dennis Lehane, but SHUTTER ISLAND is not one of my favorite novels by him.  Unlike his earlier novels, there is no character in this book that the reader can strongly relate to.  As a result, I was never emotionally invested in the story.  The book has a slightly surreal quality to it, and there are sections of this novel (mainly the middle) where pretty much nothing interesting happens.<br /><br />Still, Lehane is a great literary craftsman, and I found SHUTTER ISLAND enjoyable for the sheer quality of the prose.  This book also has a great ending, one I will not give away.  I advise readers to avoid reading too many reviews of this novel, because some of the reviewers will thoughtlessly spoil the novel's resolution for you.  Whatever you do, don't give up on this novel too soon, because I think the ending is the best part.<br /><br />In short, SHUTTER ISLAND is a good book, but you're better off reading MYSTIC RIVER or GONE, BABY GONE if you want a great Lehane novel.

As a nurse, I thought I was well informed - well, I wasn't! Reading \\"The China Study\\" was a unique and very satisfying experience.  Dr. Cambell reveals new concrete data that has drastically improved the quality of my life and health.  I'm grateful that he had the courage to tell the truth about what goes on at the top.

I only have one point to make: I had FIVE people telling me to go see Serenity. It takes a quality product to produce fans that militantly dedicated to getting things out to others.    In retrospect, it was a Katrina level tragedy that a show like this was unable to find an audience. As great as Buffy and Angel were, the miniscule number of episodes of Firefly still serve as Joss Whedon's magnum opus.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|\\"The Illusionist\\" was one of the best movies of 2006. Featuring a subtle, nuanced performance by Edward Norton that would have been Oscar nomination-worthy in a year of lesser male performances, \\"The Illusionist\\" is a movie that embraces the power of magic and love in a truly magical way. Where \\"The Prestige,\\" that other movie about magic, failed to enchant, \\"The Illusionist\\" is a visual and emotional delight from start to finish. Jessica Biel is a revelation, but the battle of wits between two intelligent adversaries, Norton's Eisenheim and Paul Giamatti's inspector, is the true acting tour-de-force. This movie is not to be missed.

Vocal harmonies galore, musicality, musicianship, great singing voice, clever lyrics, vast array of moods, serious, witty, and humorous... it does offer all of the above and then some.

B000002LRX|5.0|....and secured their musical legacy.  The Real Thing was a solid rock/rap mixture with newly hired Mike Patton providing vocals.  On Angel Dust, Patton had a lot more creative input, providing his wonderful vocal stylings and schizophrenic persona to Faith No More.  It's a joyous ride that after a less than stellar performance initially, has become something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts - and with good reason.  This album is all over the board.  Land of Sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies (which is the supposed inspiration), while Caffeine is an anthem for Patton's drug of choice, and one of FNM's most energetic recordings.  Then there is the occaisonal oddball track showing Patton's range and sense of fun, like RV, which is like a melancholic rant from the stereotypical figure you might find living in an RV.  Not exactly bilboard material, but fun. <br /> <br />Adding to the record were the internal tensions of the band.  Jim Martin was having creative differences, yet pumps out some of his best work here.  Tensions may have fueld a more agressive record, and FNM would never sound better than they do on this album.  It's the bands chemistry - both good and bad - that make this album work.  Commercially, this might have not been the hit the record company wanted, but its legacy can still be heard today and it's still a great record to crank up for a drive, barely showing its 15 year old age.

B00005JOIH|5.0|Spielberg's schizophrenic world view is on grandeur display in this movie. I like Spielberg. I really do. Like what Harry Knowles from Ain't it Cool News website says; he makes two types of movies. One to satisfy his innerchild, his curious pre-adolescent youth that he either cherishes so much that he makes movies like \\"The Goonies\\", \\"Indiana Jones\\" trilogy, \\"E.T.\\" etc. to \\"mourn\\" the loss of that period of innocence. Another part of him makes self-important films that may seem to indulgent or even forced. Spielberg excels in the former. He hits and misses with the latter. <br /> <br />Hits: <br />Schindler's List <br />Saving Private Ryan (1st 25 minutes of the film: D-Day invasion) <br />Empire of the Sun <br />Munich <br /> <br />Misses: <br />The Colour Purple <br />Amistad <br />A.I. (Kubrick should have made this before he died) <br /> <br />Out of the \\"serious\\" films, Schindler's List and Munich stands out as giants. I consider Saving Private Ryan as an adventure flick for boy scouts with grand plans on enlisting as marines. <br /> <br />With this issue aside, first off; Munich is a fine movie. One of the best film of 2005. Upon seeing it the first time in the cinema, I experienced the most nail-biting suspense welling in my chest. A sense of impending doom and horror unfolding before me onscreen as Spielberg skilfully reenacted the entire Munich hostage takeover. Of course, I know the outcome, but it's the process that hits you most. Yes, and man can be more bestial and monstrous than any other beasts in the world. No amount of explanation or hypothesis could explain the rationale behind the horrific and senseless murder of the athletes.  <br /> <br />The acting in the movie is rather dispensable. Eric Bana made a valiant effort in trying to stand out, but I feel that Spielberg is of course, the star here. In any case, this may be an attempt by the man to score a hat-trick with the directing award at the Oscars. In any case Ciaran Hinds also makes a fine supporting role as a venerable mentor to Bana's character.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, you have to decide on your own whether reprisals, political or clandestine, will work to counter potential terrorism. As Spielberg is trying to imply here, there will be no end to cycle of violence, pain and sorrow. As a blatant reminder to that, he closes the movie with no less than a clear skyline shot of the World Trade Center towers, \\"helpfully\\" reminding us that the West got their comeuppance as far as violent reprisals go. <br /> <br />Onto the DVD itself. I own the 2-disc set. It does come with a beautiful booklet that doubles as an insert. However, it's nothing more than a coffee table book with blurbs from the various critics heaping praises on the film. The 2nd disc is quite informative actually, and Mr. Spielberg is not providing an audio commentary on the feature film either. Since, it's out of print, I guess the rest of us have to settle with the 1-disc set, unless Universal pulls its tricks with a double-dip, which I highly suspect they might.

B0001EKZOQ|5.0|It is quite rare to find an album that can be enjoyed in its entirety, but this happens to be one of them. The genius arragangements of Bebo Valdes accompanied by the moving and impassioned vocals of Cegala are a match that could only be made through divine intervention.
0312340958|5.0|Karen Armstrong has written a most marvelous account of her life within a very strict order of English Catholic nuns of the 1960's.  Her description of the torments she endured has caused me to regard with renewed respect and affection the nuns who taught me in the 1950's.  How odd that we boys who were in class with the nuns for hours each day really had no idea of what kind of lives some of them led in the hours before and after school. The moral, spiritual, and intellectual gifts they bestowed on us daily are inestimable, even though at the time we were probably more interested in whether or not they actually had hair under their wimples!<br /><br />I've noticed some confusion in these reviews about several aspects of Catholic religious orders of those days.  First, despite having no contact for long periods of time with \\"seculars\\" - i.e., civilians -  Karen was not in a order of \\"cloistered\\" nuns.  Cloistered sisters do truly cut themselves off completely from the world and, if I can be so bold as to describe them, they live a life governed by \\"ora et labora\\" - work and prayer.  In fact, though, as strict as they were, Karen's order was primarily an order of teaching sisters.<br /><br />But there is a much more important concept that many people seem not quite to grasp, and that is that all Catholic youth of those days - at least in my experience - were taught that the most perfect way to be a true follower of Christ was to share in his suffering.  That is why those nuns were treated - and treated themselves - as harshly as any Marine Corps recruits would ever be treated - only the nun's harsh treatment was to continue all her life.  Certainly, most youth who took Catholicism very seriously must have given thought at one time or another to entering the religious life.  We were always told to examine ourselves to determine if we had a religious vocation, but we were also warned that it was not a calling for everyone.  In any event, to decide at a young age to become a nun, brother, or priest - to dedicate one's life to doing good - was not understood by many of us to be the same as dedicating one's whole existence to God.  When young people make the decision to enter the religious life they often do not know what that really entails.  Some religious communities are extraordinarily strict, others less so. The particularly strict order to which Karen belonged was obviously intent on making sure those young girls found out immediately that the religious life was not a game, that sharing in Christ's suffering was not to be an abstract concept but a concrete reality.  Those young nuns were to put up with the sadism of some of their superiors in the same way as Christ had to endure the sadism of his tormenters.  They were not only to tolerate it but to welcome it and even seek out even more spiritual pain and physical hardship. (As the British often jokingly say about the paddlings they endured in school, \\"Please sir may I have another?\\")  This concept of self-denial is probably not well understood in our modern climate of \\"personal fulfillment.\\"<br /><br />The total abnegation of self, of one's personal desires, of pride, of the hope for friendship and love, was the goal of the harshness they inflicted upon themselves. Their goal was to die to themselves in order to reach God.  If you do not grasp this concept I think you'll miss the heroism inherent in the story of Karen and her fellow nuns.  Naturally, that kind of life is not for very many of us, as Karen eventually found out for herself.  It may be totally misguided or, by modern standards, even pathological, but it's the way some people have reached true holiness.<br /><br />I'm very happy for myself and for all her readers that Karen Armstrong eventually chose to leave the convent and to follow another path in life.  This book is not only a gift from her but, through her, a gift to us from all those other nuns who took - and take - the road less traveled.  A truly wonderful and enlightening gift.uly wonderful and enlightening gift.
B00006D295|5.0|Released in 1975 well ahead of it's time \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" is a marvelus delight of comedy, horror sci-fi/musical all played out in a macabre style of visual storytelling. Tim Curry Is the bizarre doctor who hosts a stranded couple in his castle to witness his creation a genetacally modified human male. The film showcases a different apporach to the whole Frankenstein genre & as well as offering a young and talented Susan Sarranden who can certainley carry a tune. Weird and very different than most other films at the time The Rocky Horror Picture show is considered to be by many a true cult classic.
0380789019|1.0|This was the worst written book I have read in a very long time! Absolutely NO PLOTTING done by this author, that's obvious.  He does not bother to tie any of the loose strings together. Everything that happens is just plain convenient to the pointless meandering plot, no reason given. And the characters are cardboard cut-outs that we know nothing about beyond your basic dungeons and dragon stereotype story line. I suspect that Gaiman just sat down with a concept and wrote whatever popped into his head, and then gave it to others to proof read for him and give suggestions,  and when they said things like, \\"this just happens for no reason\\", he awkwardly went back and put in some clumsy \\"foreshadowing\\" here and there.  He started with a good first chapter and a concept (which is just a little too much like the underground magical London world of \\"Anubis Gates\\" by the masterful Tim Powers, written years before) but Gaiman had no idea where he was going after that.  All in all, it reads like a \\"fanfiction\\" and not even a very good one. It was incredibly difficult to finish reading this mess.
B000K7VHUU|5.0|If you have seen this you know. It is a very good story on how every class and background of child in high school has there own \\"what they believe\\" hell that there life is. A great story for your teen. <br /> <br />
0618680004|3.0|I was hopeful that Dawkin's book would present an interesting and logical arguement concerning the odds of there being a biblical-type God up in heaven somewhere.  What I got instead, on average, is a ranting screed aimed at Dawkin's fundamentalist enemies.  The GOD Delusion's final chapter is a thoughtful, even inspirational, look at our (humans) place in the universe and how unlikely (miraculous?) it is that we rationale beings even exist.  Unfortunately, I had to wade though pages upon pages of vindictive rant to get to nuggets of philosophical insight.  I can't recommend this book unless you're looking for a rabid critique of fundamentalists.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|the photography was gorgeous, the sepia tones, the forest scenes, all very \\"long,long-ago and far-far-away\\".  Perfect escapist entertainment.  Beautiful costumes, beautiful horses, the interior shots are beautiful, crammed with detail evoking another (and more beautiful) age.  I loved this movie and recommend it to everyone who loves mystery and romance.<br /><br />This movie would make a perfect opera, it has the setting, the characters and the music.
