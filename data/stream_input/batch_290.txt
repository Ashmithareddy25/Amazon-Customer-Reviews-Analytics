B00005QDW1|4.0|This is the album that left many No Doubt fans cold. It's a shame too. Many claim they supposedly \\"sold out.\\" Well, \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" went a whopping 10x platinum and gave them the biggest hit of their career...a pop ballad called \\"Don't Speak.\\" So I really don't think \\"selling out\\" is a valid excuse. <br />To date this album has yielded three massive hit single which have all been top 20 hits *two of them top 5.* The first single \\"Hey Baby\\" is a sort of love/hate song. I happen to love it and it's one of my favorite songs by them. Very catchy. \\"Hella Good\\" was the second single. I loved it at first but it was EXTREMELY overplayed and I quickly got sick of it. It is a good dance song, though. Good instrumentals. The third single and biggest is \\"Underneath It All.\\" This song is fantastic. I love Gwen's vocals on it and the little \\"rap\\" in the middle ... There are other good songs on here too. \\"Running\\" is a toned down, but still cool track. It strangely reminds me of Cyndi Lauper's \\"All Through the Night\\" but that's a good thing. \\"Rock Steady\\" has a very unique chorus with a nice vocal effect. \\"Making Out\\" is another personal favorite.<br />I'm glad No Doubt took the direction they did on this album. They're trying to be slightly different with each one. \\"Return of Saturn\\" was an alternative approach and I guess they decided to go more pop with this one. Try it out and form your own opinion. It's definitely worth a chance.
B00005JLSC|3.0|I had hoped to see a film reminiscent of the colorful, happy musicals of the 40's and 50's, with chorus lines and big productions.  But, much of the movie is not colorful, and doesn't approach the happy feelings imparted by earlier musicals.<br />I would give the film one star up to the point when Richard Gere finally appears.  From that point on, the movie gets better and better overall.  If I could go back in time, knowing what I know now, I would plan to arrive at the theater around 20 minutes after the film started!
B000084T18|5.0|This cd is by no means brilliant, but when you compare it to ja rule or nelly than it is. In the state hip-hop is in 2day it is a blessing to have someone who doesnt just rap about women, ice &amp; cars...etc. There isnt a track on the album that i skip, which is unusual. My favorate track on the album is 21 questions which is absolutely brilliant. 50 cent cannot possibly live up 2 the hype around him, so dont expect this cd 2 be a classic, but if you want a rapper who talks about real things, who is real hip hop, than i recommend this album. + also if u want a classic get Gods Son by Nas, its better.
0060278250|5.0|Garth Nix is truly amazing.  When I first read Sabriel after having it suggested to me, I couldn't wait for the second book.  It was just the same for this one.  You really can't ask for a better fantasy trilogy, they're up there with the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien, the Golden Compass trilogy by Pullman, and the Harry Potter books by Rowling.  Abhorsen was thrilling, exciting, scary at times, and was definately worth the read.  I can't decide if I enjoyed Abhorsen as much or better than Sabriel.  If you enjoy Nix as a writer you should check out Shade's Children as well.  I really hope that Garth Nix continues to write outstanding novels like these.
B000002KKC|5.0|Tusk is one of my all time favourite albums. I have spent hours listening to the music and studying the covers of the original album ,which to me is a wonderful journey in the Fleetwood Mac universe. In 1979 I was a young student from Denmark , visiting a Seattle family and highschool. It was like a new world opening up - and what a blast.<BR> Most music - lovers know that long lasting albums , quite often are the ones you need to spend lots of time listening to, to get to know really well. This album simply grows and grows.<BR>There are so many nuances and styles - due to the massive talent represented in the gruop. Also the fact that their previous album Rumors , was such a smash hit - enabled these powerful musicians to take Tusk to the next level artistically. You really get a feeling that the bandmembers were eager to find new ways to express their talent , and they enjoyed it.<BR>This is American pop/rock at its best. If you already know it , I'm sure you will agree. If not , go get it.
B00005JKED|2.0|As a black man and a lover of blacks in film, I thought Training day was one of Denzel's worst roles and his worst performance on film.  While watching the movie I always got the impression that he was reading a script on how to be tuff and ruthless, but failed miserably at both.  It's one of those things that hard to explain.  Your facial expression, your body language has to sync with your speech when doing a play or performing on film.  It's akin to capturing the essence of the rage of an Inner City youth in all its nuance.  It would be difficult for an actor into Shakespearean play to try and pull off the street verbage of an Inner City youth- capturing the fire and the rage and still make it \\"look real\\".  By the same token, the reverse would be true if you ask the Inner City youth to do Shakespeare, while not being impossible, it would be difficult.  Denzel Washington receiving an Academy Award for this film and not receiving one for the film \\"The Mighty Quinn\\", is to stand justice on its head.  He was superb in that film - he lived the role.  The people in charge of award selections don't know what to look for in an actor who is to portray a tuff guy - they have their cliques and attend their champagne Holloywood parties, but the don't know \\"Street\\" the way I do -If you get my drift.  Training Day will not be a part of my DVD library, but I have many other fine Denzel Washington films to fall back on.<br />PS: Hollywood, if you're thinking about doing a movie similar to Training Day, who would you cast as the tuff cop, Blair Underwood or Malik Yoba?  If you choose Blair over Malik you would have blown it again.  Blair Underwood is a fine actor and one of my favorites, but Malik would be the better choice - Get it!!!!!

B000021XS0|5.0|Most bands think that they are \\"evolving\\" as a band with each new album they put out.  Shamefully, this only ever happens in a production sense.  Few rock bands actually evolve musically.<BR>    Dream Theater, as always, is the exception to the rule.  Their first two albums are the \\"classics\\" according to the cult fans, but all cult fans seem to say that about whatever their favorite band may be.  With all due respect to all DT releases, which I am all familiar with, this is the best of them all, as of this writing in the winter of 2003.<BR>     Do you want to actually get your money's worth for buying a cd? Do you want to have a cd that you'll still be wanting to listen to 20 years from now? Do you want to have a cd where there is something new to pick up on every time you listen, even if it is the 3 millionth time? Please do this band a favor.  They practiced music in their rooms for all of their lives when they could have been doing other things, the least you can do is not copy this one from someone, and shell out the honest to god cash for this, so the well deserving musicians get their money.<BR>     If you love concept albums with amazing vocals, lyrics and plot twists, you'll become addicted to this album.  If you hate vocals and just want to listen to good complicated instrumental prog (I hate that word) compositions, you'll love this album too. Heavy riffs? Epic ballads? ROCK AND ROLL? Point made.<BR>    The guys will always over play, but for a brief multi-month period, magic happened while creating this album - it seemed they could do all the overplaying they wanted to, and still the songwriting would not lose focus. There are some moments where they just seem to go off and overjam themselves out of character of the paced flow of the album, but even many of the highly complicated lines become catchy after awhile! You'll catch yourself whistling the sextuplet guitar fills to \\"Overture\\" in the shower, I guarantee it! I truly believe that is the BEST possible music that can be made; highly intellectual, yet vividly, gutwrenchingly, memorably emotional at the same time.  I personally felt that the heart in this band has grown by leaps and bounds since \\"Awake\\", for example.<BR>     And no example could be truer than the epic moment of glory, the song \\"Spirit Carries On.\\" It is written and paced perfectly.  So emotional, words can't do much else here; one of my favorite moments in music EVER is the bridge (\\"Move on Be Brave...\\") where the chords go from e minor to E flat major.  Genius! (Of course Pink Floyd's \\"Shine On....\\" deserves the credit for innovation there).  Then there's a heart shattering solo in b minor, owing a nod to \\"Comfortably Numb.\\"  It seems like there's climax after climax, AND the band manages to keep from overplaying here! All that and the song doesn't even clock in at 7 minutes.<BR>     There's no way to speak of the godlike accomplishments on this album in any way other than writing a doctoral thesis type analysis.  Unless you can't handle heavy guitars (there's some real metal in there), I can't see ANY reason why ANYONE wouldn't be able to find atleast something they would think as incredible here.  \\"Six Degrees...\\" is amazing too, but seriously, after Metropolis 2, where else can you go?
B00003CXHJ|1.0|As a world war 2 buff I was looking forward to watching this movie, especially in the age when film makers are doing much better in obtaining accurate research to provide the best means of providing the audience with authenticity. A modern W.W.II submarine movie should be good!<BR>I was grossly disappointed. This film was slapped together by people who know nothing of submarine warfare and apparently did zero research into the subject. Some of the stunts pulled off by the sub crew and way they survived, over and over again when they should have been blown to bits, was laughable. Okay, so the film makers are entitled to a little flexibility to make for good entertainment, but they went way too far. The visual 'wow factor' rapidly diminished to 'give me a break.'<BR>The film also gave the impression that this was in some way an accurate depiction of the US navy being the first to capture the notorious Enigma coding machine, they weren't, the British already had one and had broken the codes by 1942. In summary, very much a 'B' movie, not recommended.
B00006RIO7|1.0|what an album--and movie!ALL the songs are first rate-we are of the depression generation and LOVE 20's-30's music!!Take a trip<BR>into the past--if you DARE! cant wait for the MOVIE!!looks like<BR>Moulin Rouge
B00006G8O1|5.0|This film is a clever fantasy with a suprising twist, which should keep most viewers guessing until the end. In fact, ~Darko~ has a great ending, subtle, thought inspiring and extremly powerful.<br />Donnie Darko is an over-sensitive teenager, brilliant in many ways, who is convinced the world will come to an end on a certain day in the near future. His 'imaginary' friend, a hypnotic and somewhat demonic rabbit, commands Donnie to do certain things, (the famous schizophenic voice) also informing the boy of future events. The screenplay by director and writer, Richard Kelly, is indeed flawless, which manages to connect seemingly disconnected people and events in the boy's life in a very believable and compelling way.<br />The cast is an unusual ensemble that one would not expect to see in an offbeat film - Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell and Drew Barrymore; all gave great performances, and especially Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead, whose haunting expression, particularly his eyes during his strange visions, was quite remarkable.<br />~Donnie Darko~ is one of those rare and surprising films, dark, humorous and original - this is an excellent motion picture.
6305807086|5.0|I avoided this 1999 film when it was in the theaters.  It looked just plain silly to me.  And yet, it's received accolades from critics everywhere.  And so I decided to catch up on what everyone was making such a fuss about and see the DVD.  Oh my!  What a film!  I've never seen anything so innovative and creative in my life!<br />John Cusak stars as an out-of-work puppeteer.  Cameron Diaz is his wife.  Catherine Keener is the sassy woman they both find attractive.  And John Malkovich plays a version of himself.  All are excellent actors.  And all are exceptional.  How the writer, Charlie Kaufman, ever thought up the premise is amazing.  And the director, Spike Jonze, certainly knew how to make it all fit together.<br />This is a comedy with depth.  And the laughs and insights keep getting better.  There's an office building with a floor numbered 7-1/2.  It's only 4 feet high and everyone who works there has to walk around half stooped over.  Then there's a secret doorway behind a file cabinet.  When a person crawls in, he or she falls down a tunnel and finds himself or herself inside the brain of the actor John Malkovich for a mere 15 minutes.  Soon, Catherine Keener and John Cusak are selling tickets to people who want to experience this.  Soon, too, Cameron Diaz gets hooked  - so much so that, with an interesting gender-bender twist of the plot, she finds herself being John Malkovich while making love to Catherine Keener.  And that's just one of the many sub-plots.<br />Sound confusing?  Well it's not.  It might sound silly, but as a viewer I was completely there with the story all the way, letting myself enjoy the twists and turns of the plot that just kept getting better as this intriguing tale moved along.  It's all very surreal.  And it's absolutely brilliant.<br />Later, I thought about all the themes it touched on.  The puppeteer theme had to do with manipulation, both with puppets and with real people.  Everyone was manipulated in this film, and different people pulled the strings at different times.  It also had to do with what it means to be a celebrity.  And what, actually, is identity?<br />I loved this film and hoped the DVD would have some good special features.  I yearned for insight into the making of the film and I wished there were interviews with the actors.  Instead, there's scene with an &quot;extra&quot; who had the job of driving a car back and forth all night so that the headlights would give the appropriate background for one of the shots.  And a scene where the director feels sick and throws up.  However, when I think about it, what can I expect from such off-beat filmmakers?<br />This is the most refreshing film to come out of Hollywood that I've ever seen.  It might not be for everyone but I thought it was great!  It therefore gets one of my highest recommendations.people pulled the strings at different times.

B000088E6M|5.0|50 Cent is hot in the streeys and he is the next big  thing. His album is amazingly hot from beginning to end. Songs like Patiently Waiting, Heat, Up In Tha Club and Dont Push Me can be rewinded over and over without being worn out. Its about time an artist came out and lived up to the hype with an incredible album. It makes you mad that the album has to end.

This book about these chinese women that talk about the thier lives moving to the states is amazing. It shows us that coming during a time of war and famine wasn't easy for these women. And that we think that we havetrouble sometimes but they show us it isn't or wasn't easier for them. This was a wonerful book that i highly recommend.

B00005RHGK|1.0|The hype preceeding this movie, including a good review by Stephen King, made me very anxious to see it and I was very disappointed in it when I did. Take one generic creature with wings and a movie with a flimsy plot and great marketing, think Blair Witch Project here, and you have a complete waste of time at an hour and a half. The two leads are good but the fact is this movie is not scary...you're better off with The Ring or even The Others. Don't waste your time with this one...Francis Ford Coppola has his name attached as a Producer...how embarassing!
B0000024TT|5.0|I have just recently discovered Leonard Cohen and have taken it upon myself to pick up all of his albums. However, nothing compares to this one. It is phenomenal from start to finish. His songs are a bit reminiscent of Bob Dylan, although the content is of a polar opposite nature.<br />&quot;Suzanne&quot; touches the heart like few songs do, until you listen to &quot;So Long Marianne&quot; and you really start to yearn for that lost love. <br />When I got this album I listened to it on repeat for an entire day to try to discover it's cryptic message and I am still wondering now.
B00005JLSC|5.0|There's a reason this show has gone on so long, on and off Broadway . . . this is great film adaptation of a big, blowsy, bluesy stage show . . . the music is terrific and the performances uniformly excellent (something I never thought I'd say about Richard Gere, in a musical yet) with Zellweger (way too thin, however) a standout in the part of a singer and dancer, and Zeta-Jones too gorgeous to believe as a singer and dancer who doesn't have to act it. Taye Diggs has a tiny, but telling part . . . he's a comer. If you're old enough to have loved the golden days of Hollywood musicals, this is a nostalgic trip . . . but even if you're a relative kid, there's a reason everyone loved the big, singing, dancing, Saturday afternoon show.
B00006CXSS|5.0|That modesty and that sentiment seems to be shared by all the survivors of Easy Company, 506th PRI, and many of them can't hold back the tears as they mumble it.  One of the great benefits of this marvelous series was the closeup interviews of the real men portrayed, those wonderful old seamed faces, breaking at last with emotion as they recall their experiences and the love of their comrades and the pain of loss of other friends. It moves me greatly, and I'm glad the Extras in this set has an extended documentary re-tracing the time-frame of the film with these real veterans recalling the action we've seen re-created.     Brought with loving care and fanatic attention to detail by producers Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks and their carefully chosen band of producers, directors and actors, this is an unsentimental, near-documentary telling of the story of Easy Co. from training to D-Day, Hedge Row fighting, Operation Market Garden, Bastogne, into Germany, liberation of Death Camps, and the capture of Berchesgarden & Hitler's Eagle's Nest.    Throughout it all, the aim has been to tell it straight and get it right. They have done so in remarkable style.  The truth HAS enough drama, and the various episodes reveal it.  We get to know these men and care about them.  We marvel at their endurance and the way they go about getting the job done, professionally, and with matter-of-fact, everyday courage. It is a true tribute to the Citizen Soldiers who won the war.    With 10 episodes and lots of extra goodies, presented within an exceptional package, there is just too much to review here.  Some memorable moments:  the harrowing jump into the explosive, tracer-lit night skies of Normandy; the assault on the 88's; Winter's killing the young German; the episode dedictated to the Medic; the monstrous artillery barrage on the men in the snowy forest of Bastogne; the shock of the farmer's wife on seeing the closeup hand-to-hand killing of the German by \\"Bull\\"; and finally, the incredibly moving scenes of the liberation of the Concentration Camp, and the final days of Easy at the War's end.    These last episodes are all the more powerful because we have followed Easy Co. and these men and  have seen the death so random and arbitrary around and among them that a slow emotional tension has been built that we now realize with the intensity of anger/pity/horror at the Camps and the bittersweet joy and subsequent farewell of VE day.    I could cite great moments by each individual actor, and nicely played and effectively understated but powerfully emotional scenes but suffice it to say this is an ensemble piece with superb performances throughout. The quiet power of the different episodes underscores how wonderfully written the entire piece is, and with corresponding excellent direction and production values.  A one-of-a-kind production, having the time to tell the tale with detail and care, and with all involved doing honor to the men who lived it.  And finally, there are those men, bringing it all back to the reality of real lives lived.  Exceptional stuff.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Rene Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah and Mya. Shall I go on, great cast, top notch music, very funny and by the way, a strong plot. Makes for one of the best movies ever made. Thumbs way up and recommended for the whole family. I loved it!!

Many people have purchased this album after hearing it in my car when merely riding with me.

From the title track to &quot;Georgia Rae&quot;, you won't be disappointed.
B000002UAX|5.0|Music during the 20th Century has created for itself many conventions. The sophomore jinx, the one hit wonder, the artistic breakthrough, the comeback. One of the conventions of music is that when a popular artist reaches their peak, they release an album that is brilliant, not for being cohesive, but for being far-reaching in its sprawl and sometimes messiness. Songs In The Key of Life by Stevie Wonder and Prince's Sign &quot;O&quot; The Times&quot; are examples of these albums. But the original masterpiece in the double album format was the Beatles self-titled album that has since picked up the affectionate name &quot;The White Album&quot;.<br />First thing first; this is probably one of the best albums by the Beatles, but the thing to note is that it is not really a Beatles album in the sense of their early work or even their later work. This was the Beatles working not only as a group but by themselves. They are not just trying to create one type of music; they are experimenting with music forms of all kinds. There is swing elements &quot;Honey Pie&quot;, folksy songs &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;, avant-garde &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, blues, plenty of rock and they even hint at the future of rock with the song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;.<br />The album finds John Lennon rising in power as the most formidible writer of the four, writing some of his best songs for the album. Paul is not far behind. What is most impressive is George Harrison's contribution. George really had become a great writer in his own right, giving us &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. Even Ringo Starr gives writing a go.<br />This album symbolises rock music at its best; it is messy, eclectic and revolutionary. Its surprisingly excellent quality in spite of its length and messiness is something that only a handful of artists have managed to match (Stevie Wonder, Prince, Marvin Gaye and a few others have succeeded), but this was the original and some might say, the best.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Master filmmaker Miyazaki has created one of the most beautiful animated movies I've ever seen. Frankly, I'm beyond impressed. Anime seems to have a much more realistic feel and the themes are very adult in nature. With intellectual themes, magical creatures and mature relationship issues, this is one captivating movie.<br /><br />Even though the film doesn't make judgments about good or evil, it does make a statement that pervades the entire story. The message is ecological in nature and asks many questions about the role of humans and animals on the planet. The characters have to deal with loyalty, fate and death. The characters are really not trying to save the planet, they are dealing more with survival issues.<br /><br />Princess Mononoke was raised by wolves on a mountain. She wears a fur type coat with ears attached. Very cute. The mountain is ruled by the forest spirit who never speaks, but has the power to give or take life. The tiny forest spirits that rattle their heads are adorable. They are like little ghosts. The forest spirit changes shape at night and when he walks through the forest as a \\"deer god,\\" flowers grow around his hooves.<br /><br />The forest is so beautiful it is not difficult to see why the animals want to preserve the pristine location. The animals all talk and are larger than most animals. In fact, they are actually gods defending their mountains. There is quite a bit of violence so this is not really an animated movie for children. They might be a bit frightened by the boar crawling with demon worms or the huge explosion that kills the boars.<br /><br />Ashitaka takes up the role of warrior and kills a demon-boar monster threatening his village. In killing this angry beast, he is cursed and retains a marking on his skin from the battle. When he arrives in the forest, he finds himself torn between helping the animals and helping the humans.<br /><br />\\"Ashitaka: Look, everyone! This is what hatred looks like! This is what it does when it catches hold of you! It's eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me! Fear and anger only make it grow faster!\\"<br /><br />I think it is honor that drives him to help the women of Irontown. I don't think he really is fighting on the side of Lady Eboshi. At least we don't want him to because she is after all trying to kill the forest spirit. I think Ashitaka is trying to take both sides or is at least trying to promote peace. He sees that humans need to work to make a living and that might include chopping down a few trees. The wolf tells him that when the trees are chopped down they cry. I don't like chopping down trees, but I don't think they cry. ;) That was when the movie went off into a more mythological interpretation.<br /><br />While Princess Mononoke takes the side of the wild boar tribe, Ashitaka takes the side of the outcasts working in an iron mine.<br /><br />A much more realistic feel than most Disney animations. This also has a much deeper emotional appeal for adults.<br /><br />I could have watched the dragonflies and butterflies in this movie for a much longer period of time. The delicate mist floating over the lush hillsides was amazing in itself. The beauty of the forest spirit was just amazing and really you just have to see this movie to believe how beautiful animation can be. The scenes of the Night walker are just astounding from an animation perspective.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewme alive, and very soon now it will kill me!

B00005JLRR|4.0|I went into this movie with expectations at floor level. 9 critics out of 10 had dissed the film to some extent, and the plot (from what I knew of it) didn't sound too promising. I was expecting to be disappointed. Pleasantly, I was in for a small treat. While most certainly not the best film in the Star Trek canon, \\"Nemesis\\" serves up some good dialogue, moody effectiveness, action, and philosophical angst.<br />The story starts within the Romulan senate, and the exterior view of the senate chamber, panning down from the sky above, looks like something straight of the Star Wars prequels. The senate is assassinated, and a new leader emerges. His name is Shinzon, and he proves to be the namesake of the film. Meanwhile, on Earth, Wil Riker and Deanna Troi are getting married. The nuptials are overseen by Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and many of the \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" regulars and semi-regulars are in attendance. Soon, the crew is underway to Troi's home planet, so that they can stage a Betazoid version of the wedding. If you do not know who Romulans, Riker, Troi, Picard, or Betazoids are, then this movie isn't for you. The film does not explain it to you. This one's for the fans. Just letting you know.<br />Aboard the Enterprise, Picard and Co. hear a strange signal emanating from a planet, investigate, and find a duplicate of their android crew member, Data. News soon reaches the Federation that the new Romulan leader wishes to make peace with them, so the Enterprise is sent to extend an olive branch. Shock of all shocks, Shinzon is actually a human clone of Captain Picard, and is bent on making war, not peace (this is all given away in the previews). Shinzon also hates the Romulans, as they had exiled him in his youth to their sister planet, Remus, a cold, desolate place enshrouded in darkness. With a Reman band of desperados, Shinzon plans to destroy the Romulans and the Federation with his super warship and its massive, devastating new weapon. Picard andcrew must, of course, stop him.<br />\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" is, in many ways, a paler version of an earlier Star Trek movie, \\"The Wrath of Khan\\", a film considered by most Trekkies and non-Trekkies alike to be the best in the series. There is a villain with a personal vendetta against the protagonist (Khan vs. Kirk / Shinzon vs. Picard). There is an emphasis on great ship-to-ship space battles. Both films feature the climactic battle scenes inside conveniently-placed nebulas. And both films feature the death of one of the main characters. I must say that, like \\"Wrath of Khan\\", \\"Nemesis\\" delivered somewhat of an emotional wallop for me. The inclusion of old familiar characters such as Wesley Crusher, Guinan, and Admiral Janeway make for nice touches. There are nice \\"talkie\\" scenes, where the characters explore the undercurrents of what drives them, and what makes them unique. All in all, it works. This is purported to be the final film featuring the cast of \\"The Next Generation\\". If so, it is a fitting end.<br />You're going to have to overlook some things about \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\", and just kind of 'go' with it. Yes, there are some plot points that don't make sense. Yes, the wedding scene is excruciatingly hammy. And, yes, Shinzon is rather reminiscent of Austin Powers' own nemesis, Dr. Evil. But perhaps it is because I grew up watching cheesy British sci-fi that I can sidestep some of these issues, and try to focus on the general story at hand. We are given some good food for thought regarding cloning (timely, to say the least), and the uniqueness that makes up who we are as individuals. There is also humor, camaraderie, and sacrifice.<br />\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" is a dark film in many ways (set design, lighting, plotline), but it does feature one startling positive message: that we can change ourselves for the better. This sort of unequivocally bright outlook is what helped define the seven year run of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\". I'm not sure what the future holds for humans, and our possible exploration of the stars, but this particular incarnation of \\"Star Trek\\" has always been the way that I would look to see it turn out. They do, indeed, boldly go.
6300214435|4.0|Of the three Indiana Jones pictures, this one is possibly the best.  The first one might have had a more far-reaching plot (I mean, how do you top the wrath of God?), and the third was just a laughable (not a compliment) parody of itself.  But \\"Temple of Doom\\" is my favorite because there are several stretches of the movie that have so much action you literally don't have time to catch your breath.  The timing of these scenes and the stunt coordination are done so well I can't think of a movie that has done this better. <br />The only irritation, and unfortunately it's a major one, is the Kate Capshaw character (say that fast ten times).  I can see comic relief at certain points in a movie, but her role is used WAY too much.  Her constant whining and screeching in practically every scene she's in gets irritating much too quickly, and unfortunately, continues for the entire movie.  I don't blame her, I blame the plot, and the movie would have been much better had she been a stronger character.  <br />But this is not to take away from otherwise a very fine adventure.  The opening sequence opens with a lavish stage production, which leads to a double-crossing situation between Jones and the shady owner of the club.  It takes off from there with an exciting scramble for both a diamond and a vial of poison antidote.  The thrills don't  end until Jones needs to figure out how to get out of the middle of a rope bridge with the enemy coming from both sides and hungry crocodiles several hundred feet below.  Even with the point I don't like, this is still an action film for the ages.
0792842499|1.0|Sergio Leone plumbed his greatest depths of nitwittedness when he essayed the script for this travesty.  Still, people are watching it 35 years later, so his financiers got something out of it.  It would take the film's full running time to detail how bad it is but one scene captures some of the flavor.  Prisoner Eli Wallach the Ugly is being transported to the gallows by Union troop train when he throws himself and his guard out the door of a crowded boxcar.  Nobody says hey, train never stops, and neither does another express coming the other way when Wallach uses it to cut the cuffs between him and his dead captor, despite the fact that the deceased is laying in the middle of the tracks.  Leone knew exactly nothing about the American West and neither do the people who enjoy his ludicrously mismanaged fantasies about the time and place.
B000002UAX|5.0|Music during the 20th Century has created for itself many conventions. The sophomore jinx, the one hit wonder, the artistic breakthrough, the comeback. One of the conventions of music is that when a popular artist reaches their peak, they release an album that is brilliant, not for being cohesive, but for being far-reaching in its sprawl and sometimes messiness. Songs In The Key of Life by Stevie Wonder and Prince's Sign &quot;O&quot; The Times&quot; are examples of these albums. But the original masterpiece in the double album format was the Beatles self-titled album that has since picked up the affectionate name &quot;The White Album&quot;.<br />First thing first; this is probably one of the best albums by the Beatles, but the thing to note is that it is not really a Beatles album in the sense of their early work or even their later work. This was the Beatles working not only as a group but by themselves. They are not just trying to create one type of music; they are experimenting with music forms of all kinds. There is swing elements &quot;Honey Pie&quot;, folksy songs &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;, plenty of rock and they even hint at the future of rock with the song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;.<br />The album finds John Lennon rising in power as the most formidible writer of the four, writing some of his best songs for the album. Paul is not far behind. What is most impressive is George Harrison's contribution. George really had become a great writer in his own right, giving us &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. Even Ringo Starr gives writing a go.<br />This album symbolises rock music at its best; it is messy, eclectic and revolutionary. Its surprisingly excellent quality in spite of its length and messiness is something that only a handful of artists have managed to match (Stevie Wonder, Prince, Marvin Gaye and a few others have succeeded), but this was the original and some might say, the best.
B000088E6M|5.0|This cd is simply good, except for one or two songs.

B00003CXI1|5.0|The first in the J.K. Rowling series entitled \\"Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone\\" is one of the best fantasy films that I've seen in a very long time. While nowhere near as captivating or as visually explosive as the Lord of the Rings movies, Harry Potter is a marvelous silver screen adaptation of Rowling's first novel. I know that I will almost certainly be butting heads against HP book-reading purists as I'm a Harry Potter newbie (as of writing this review) and I can fully understand that, but this movie is a marvelous fantasy classic. I have no regrets about buying this on video and I've watched it countless times over and will continue to do so in the coming years.<br />The movie begins with Hogwarts Professor Dumbledore bringing a an orphaned Potter to his uncle Vernon Dursley and aunt Petunia Dursley who, along with spoiled cousin Dudley, become very unkind towards him due to their belief that witches, wizards' magic are a grave threat and they try to bury the whole topic during his childhood realizing that Potter was the child of a wizard and a witch, something that the Dursley family wanted nothing to do with. Later, a friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid comes crashing in and takes care of Potter's abusive relatives and takes Potter to a huge school of wizardry and witchcraft called Hogwarts by means of a secret passageway called Platform 9 3/4. I sometimes even think of why the carts don't crash into the wall instead of vanishing through.  During the trip there Potter meets Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. It was around that time when the rivalry with the troublesome Draco Malfoy would begin. It was eventually around then when he'd learn of the evil wizard known as Voldemort who killed his parents but why Harry himself is so famous. And so the adventures that involve monstrous creatures, magic, witchcraft, Quidditch matches, all begin.<br />The cast of the characters was great even though maybe not perfect. Richard Harris did such a wonderful job portraying Albus Dumbledore and with his tragic passing, he will be missed by millions of movie goers. No word on who could take Harris' place. Maggie Smith does such an incredible job playing the fearsome, strict but fair Professor McGonagall. I love that British accent and it's so funny seeing her get angry when Potter and his gang get in trouble at school. She was perfect for McGonagall's role. Alan Rickman has that unsettling deep commanding voice that perfectly matches the mysterious Severus Snape, Slytherin's Potions Teacher. Tom Felton does a solid performance playing the cold-hearted Hogwarts bully, Draco Malfoy. Although he is sinister in terms of Hogwarts students, if Malfoy was real, he would seem like a nice guy compared to some of the violent bullies in real-life schools! :( The threesome Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley, and Emma Watson, were great choices to play these characters.<br />A great amount of suspenseful music gives the movie a relatively chilling feel to it. The production is excellent in the entire movie and the special effects are astounding, even if nowhere near as mind-blowing like those from The Lord of the Rings are. I know that there's already tons of LOTR vs. HP going on all over the place and while I definitely prefer LOTR over HP, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is a marvelous classic that should be owned by almost any movie lover.raying Albus Dumbledore and with his tragic passing, he will be missed by millions of movie goers.

B000089CKH|5.0|I have long been awaiting this album and I can honestly say I am not disappointed. If you like some of the more dynamic songs by Nada Surf such as firecracker (from proximity effect) you might not be so enthused about this as the songs are all a bit more mellow. The standout songs on this i think are Hi-speed soul and the The way you wear your head which are some of the faster paced songs on the album. As always though if you like good music and meaningful lyrics then you will love this new album!
0671015206|5.0|This is such an excellent book.  It is really a good read for everyone and is definitely an eye-opener.  I would have never guessed that most millionaires live in middle-class and upper middle-class neighborhoods and that they usually do not drive expensive import luxury vehicles and don't belong to country clubs.  I suppose not buying luxury consumer goods was a big contributor to their financial success, along with extensive saving and investing plans.  This book does state that being thrifty will really help you become wealthy, but it also infers that you don't have to deprive yourself of every luxury to build wealth.<br />If you are looking for a book to tell you how to invest to become wealthy, this book is NOT for you.  However, if you are looking for a book to find out simple common-sense behaviors you can partake in to assist you in building wealth (along with saving and investing), this book does a marvelous job.

B000002NFM|5.0|I'l make it simple. Since 1991 when these guys busted out &quot;Experience&quot;, they have torn down and rebuilt &quot;techno&quot; with every album that comes out. This is definitely in the top 5 dance albums of the nineties, along with &quot;Vegas&quot;, &quot;Dig your Own Hole&quot;, and &quot;Better Living Through Chemistry&quot;. Climbatize is the greatese song on the whole album. It slowly builds and builds until it just explodes in your face! Anyone unaware with the Prodigy should buy this album and the Dirtchamber Sessions. They will change your life. Peace.

B00005RHGK|1.0|...that I just spent 1 1/2 hours watching this horrible movie.  I heard many good things about it, and was very excited to see it myself, and then I actually saw it, and...  I can't believe how BAD it was.  I don't even begin to comprehend what people saw it in.  The script was just INANE, it just did not make any sense at all- some of their ridiculous actions led one to question whether the characters were on drugs or something.  There were plotholes (as can be expected from any horror movie), but they were just so glaring that they were unforgivable.  There was one suspenseful scene in the whole movie- the one with the cats.  I would not recommend this trash even for a late-night party.  It was HORRIBLE- do not see.  (And I do not give things one star lightly)

B00006F83Y|4.0|This is a great album, an opinion coming from a brand new fan of this band. I got this album first because Dave Grohl plays drums on it, then I rushed out and bought their first two, self titled and Rated R, those blew me away even more. They are much heavier and melodic compared to this one. Don't get me wrong, Songs For The Deaf is amazing and a bit more mature in sound from the first two, but I still like the first two albums better, they're much more fun to listen to, the songs just rock so much harder. All I'm saying is if you like this album, don't stop there, buy the first two as well, you won't be disappointed!
0440211727|5.0|\\"A Time to Kill\\" freaked out one of my professors so much that he put it down after the second page, vowing never to return.  It then became the last of the currently published Grisham books for me to read; if it appalled an attorney, would *I* be able to read it?<br />This was such an incredible story that I was surprised to read this was John Grisham's first book.<br />The premise is simple:  two drunks repeatedly rape a ten year old girl, crushing her poor little body and mind.  She's hurt so badly that, even when she's out of critical condition, the damage control assessment is that she'll never bear children.<br />An arrest is quick.  When the prisoners are being moved, the irate father shoots them down, injuring an officer of the court in the process.<br />The underlying story isn't quite so simple.  The book is set in the South.  The little girl is black.  The rapists are white.<br />On the one hand, it did disturb me that the father wanted a fair trial, one that never came to fruition for the rapists (who were dead long before a trial date).  On the other hand, while reading, an old Twisted Sister lyric repeated over and over in my head:<br />    \\"Now before you shake your head/Think if it was your child instead!\\"*<br />Those lyrics haunted me in the mid-80s when I first heard them, and I'd never forgotten.<br />Another major aspect of this book is the amount of prejudice there appears to be in the South.  I'm from a middle-class family in New England, and I honestly didn't know that things were still this bad.  We have prejudice, sure, but I've only heard of one Klan rally up here.  I'm not sure if my parents did a disservice to me by raising me to judge people by their actions and not by the color of their skin, because I was shocked by what I read.  (How can we human beings expect world peace when our own country is at war with itself?)<br />\\"A Time to Kill\\" will stay with me for a long, long time.  It made me think a lot.  I'm glad I got over my fear, and that I read it.  Frightening though it is, it is VERY real, and it's an eye-opening book for parents.<br />*from \\"Street Justice,\\" part of HORROR-TERIA (The Beginning) by Twisted Sister, 1984

B000088E6M|5.0|Okay so he is huge and he's only gonna get bigger, but 50 cnet has the talent to back it up. I can only think of 2 songs out of 19 I didn't feel right away, but my God this man is a genius. Wanksta is a classic, the 2nd verse should say it all, rappin &quot;chedda&quot; with &quot;amaretta&quot; is just smooth and hilarious. High all the Time is also a smooth song where at one point he challenges Nas and Jigga for the throne of New York. And it is a substantial challenge. Most people look at Biggie and Nas as having instant classics but listen to the words and New York drawl on 50 and you can see his style is different than anything you have ever heard before. His street cred. is at its peak and you should see everyone trying to get this guys album. I am in Canada and up here this man is selling out! The last time I remember that happening for a debut release was DMX and Snoop's Doggystyle. He will outsell both of them with this album and it ain't all hype. <br />Very glad to see, Wanksta put in here, Life's On The Line-I had that 1 year ago. You Not Like Me is another 50 classic. In Da Club will be the anthem for the next 4 months leading into the summer. And I think my fav. tracks besides the already mentioned are anyone of the first 10 songs!From 11-13 I am not so sure but then the last 5 songs are amazing again. 16/18 songs is an instant classic. So Higgins please don't sell 50 short again!
B00005221M|5.0|As long as you don't expect the movie to follow the book exactly, you will love this movie.  Its attempt to capture the wildness of the northeast states during the colonization were wonderful.  The colorful filmwork brought out exceptional detail.  The fight scenes may have been full of gore, however it makes the fighting repugnant, something I believe the director was trying for.  It didn't glorify it by any means.
0316666343|2.0|Unless you're a sentimental middle-aged housewife, don't believe the hype.<br />This book is trite and completely ordinary.  The voice is tired, the characters are cliched, the plot sags, and the aftertaste is that of water.  I persevered past page 70 -- indeed, I finished the book out of sheer will, trying to see what in the world was so remarkable and moving about it.  But it remained utterly bland and uncompelling.  (The mom is sad.  The dad is sad.  The sister is sad.  The murderer is bad and sad.  Things Fall Apart.) No creativity AT ALL was involved in the writing of this book.  So Susie narrates from heaven with courage and acuity?  Big deal.  Where's the spark?  The resonance?  The complex, three-dimensional characters?  All I see is a contrived, sappy attempt at poignancy.<br />But sheep would fawn over this book.  And they have. It sure does &quot;pull&quot; &quot;at&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;heartstrings.&quot;
0316666343|3.0|If a book is telling a compelling or exciting or even a touching story I am willing to stay up until 1 a.m. to read just one more chapter. I started The Lovely Bones December 26, 2002 and just finished reading February 4, 2003. In the beginning the book grabbed my attention but after the first 100 or so pages it graps starting slipping. I would pick the book up maybe once a week and read a chapter and put back down again. From all the hipe and reviews I was expecting so much more than was actually there (for me anyway). I don't feel that I wasted my time reading the book but I think that it could have been so much better. The character developement of Mr. Harvey definitly needed more work. He was a central character but not much attention was given to him. Susies mother was another chacter that I felt needed more work. I had so many questions about her behavior and why she made the choices that she made. Without giving to much away I will say that I was confused about her behavior and apparent selfishness. I was especially bemused by a comment that she made near the end of the book regarding her feelings for Susie. She definitly needed more work. The charcter developement of Susie was much better. I think that Ms. Sebold did a good job of telling the story the way a 14 year girl in the 1970's would. Even after her horrible death Susie had a innocence that was sweet and sincere. I think that Linsey was the most well developed chacter. The effect of losing her sister, the stigma of being the sister of the murdered girl plus all the other ups and downs of growing up were expressed very well. Unfortunately, the ending was a let down.  I know that justice doesn't always prevail and I don't expect every story to have a neat or happy ending but the ending seemed to quick.  It was almost like Ms. Sebold ran out of ideas.
B000003CMB|5.0|The best live album ever made.Though never given credit it really began the Live album genre;the musical interplay between the members is astounding from beginning to end they display musical power and gracfulness.Today many of the jam band genre drone endlessly.

B00006HBUA|5.0|&quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; is the live-action film version based on the original hit cartoon series, &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?&quot;. Directed by Raja Gosnell, it is fun and has the same spirit as the TV series did, while in 3-D.<br />PLOT SUMMARY: In the opening of the film version of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, the Scooby gang are in the middle of solving a mystery. They have become very famous, but when Velma (Linda Cardellini) thinks everything is too formulatic, she decides to quite. The self-proclaimed leader and concited Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.) as well as Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) also quite, leaving Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and Scooby behind with the Mystery van. Two years later, all five of them receive mysterious invitations to an amusement park for college students called Spooky Island. At the airport, they discover that all of them have received the invitations and reluclantly decide to go. On the plane, Shaggy meets Mary Jane (Isla Fisher) and falls in love with her. It's ironic how she's allergic to dogs. When they get to Spooky Island, they meet the strange theme park owner, Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) who claims that something has gone terribly wrong in his theme park: the students who come to the park, arrive as their normal, wild and crazy selves. But when they leave, they are super-serious students, who act almost like zombies. Now, it's up to the Mystery Inc. gang to solve the mystery before it destroys all of humanity.<br />MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I must say how surprised I am by liking the film. I guess it's because I loved the TV show. The acting performances are probably the best part about the film--watching these young, talented actors like Gellar, Cardellini, Prinze Jr., and especially Lillard, transform into the cartoon characters who everybody loves. But Lillard steals the show--he manages to capture Shaggy's character like no other and brings him to life. I really believed that Matthew Lillard wasn't just PLAYING Shaggy, buthe WAS Shaggy. The storyline is fun, light, and easy to follow. It can be scary at times for very young children, but it is mainly harmless. The directing by Raja Gosnell was amazing, and the special effects were awesome, especially the CG Scooby. It must be a challenge for actors to play alongside any CG character, but the cast of &quot;Scooby&quot; pulled it off really well. There are enough surprises to keep you interested, even though it may seem a bit predictable.<br />The DVD has lots of goodies which include a making of the film documentary, filmmakers' and cast's commentary options, never-before-seen footage, featurettes, a music video, &quot;hidden extras&quot;, interactive computer games, and DVD-ROM extras. The DVD is available in both wide screen and full frame formats.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;.<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+

0440237688|5.0|Twelve-year-old Jonas has lived his life in a controlled community. At first glance this community is a virtual utopia where pain, suffering, and disorder do not exist. Demanding rules run this society, leaving no room for personal growth beyond communal expectations. At his 12 ceremony, a public celebration of age, Jonas and his peers are assigned jobs. Jonas is -chosen- to be the Receiver of Memory, a job that places him under the guidance of the Giver. In receiving the memories of the Giver and of the past world Jonas comes to question his community. Though the memories come with great pain they drive an ardent longing for a life of freedom, choice, love, beauty, and wisdom. The longing leads to a plan, a plan that allows for \\"no looking back\\".<br />     The Giver is a beautiful book! It's truly complex in its simplicity. Louis Lowry manages to bring to life the community, taking a fantastic world and making it believable. His characters and their community live vividly in the mind of the reader. Lowry's simple writing style leaves the reader to struggle with the flaws of the misguided \\"utopia\\" and the difficult choice between security and freedom. <br />     The ending is vague and somewhat unsatisfying to a mind used to being given a straightforward outcome. In writing it so, Lowry offers a chance for the reader to apply his or her own thoughts and morals to the resolution, in essence giving them the freedom that his protagonist searches for. All in all, The Giver is a thought-provoking book that will stay with the reader for a long time.

B00004YL6D|5.0|Definetly One of my all times favorite Bands, POISON rocked the 80's, the 90's, and as a few good bands of those \\"Long Hair Golden Years\\", they still rocking these days!!! <BR>This is one of the albums that made me a big Poison fan for life!, every single song on this Album is a Rock n' Roll Party  anthem, and for me (as for many people) those songs became for sure, part of my \\"Life Soundtrack\\".....
0312305060|4.0|Whenever someone starts making a point of telling me, or whoever might be listening, that the world is a great place, that it's a beautiful day, that life is really worth living, I can't help but suspect that this someone is suffering a mild or moderate form of depression.  There is something desperate about such profuse positive declarations - why, after all, need such sentiments be expressed unless there was some doubt about them.  Whatever its virtues, 'The Hours' suffers from a spirit sodden with such tendentious declarations.  Its redemptive moments of happiness consequently fail to ring true.<BR>*<BR>Virtually all the characters share an underlying cattiness, which I found surprising and disappointing.  This similarity might have been intentional, straining to embody the emotional milieu of Bloomsbury as imagined by Cunningham, and to provide an emotional link between the three strands of story, but it also selects and emphasises a superficial level in the characters' emotional spectra, a level that, for me, was off-putting and, given its repeated emphasis, undermined any conviction in the characters' capacities to experience deeper emotions.  <BR>*<BR>There is a notable absence of powerful negative emotions.  Nobody hates.  Jealousy is tempered and compromised.  Yet death, specifically suicide, is central to the book's concerns.  For me, the deaths are robbed of their seriousness, of their tragedy, and, frankly, of their reality, in that they do not emerge from an emotional world where the dark aspects of human nature are acknowledged and made palpable.  The cattiness mentioned previously is allied with a superficial aesthetic preoccupation that polishes the surface of the prose, and of the characters' interactions.  The suicides are in danger of being seen as almost aesthetic gestures - like blemishes upon the tidy lives and tidy passions portrayed in the book.  There is something deeply unsatisfying about this.  These are people stalked by madness, decay and impending death, and who have complex and fraught emotional attachments, yet beautiful prose and beautiful flowers are offered as sublimations of this.  <BR>*<BR>While the above reservations prevent me from accepting 'The Hours' as 'profound', the lavishness of the prose, its unabashed sensuality, the willingness to celebrate an agonistic relationship with an established great author, all this is exciting, and a potent antidote for so much narrative writing that finds its inspiration in disingenuously objective journalism.  Perhaps the disguise it offers to troubling emotions and death is what most of us need, at least some of the time.
0375414053|5.0|I liked this book very much.  One reviewer called it \\"a slow read\\" and I consider that a compliment.  I enjoyed the humor and sharp observations so much that I slowed down to catch them all.  I gallop through many books and it's like wolfing down food.  <br />Kate isn't a workaholic so much for extrinsic rewards as for her own intrinsic needs.    I find her a sympathetic character.  <br />I read parts of the book aloud to my husband, always saying, \\"I don't feel COMPLETELY like this,\\" while knowing I feel doggone close.<br />I cracked up on page one as she \\"distressed\\"  mince pies, and then on the next page when she observed, \\"Women used to have time to make mince pies and had to fake orgasms.  Now we can manage the orgasms, but we have to fake the mince pies.  And they call this progress.\\"
B00006JJ1O|5.0|A lot of people have tried to pass this album (and this group) off as a marketing gimmic. Sure, two young lesbian producers making an album together DOES sound like the kind of thing that would get young males (American or Russian) into stores, but that turned out to be just a lot of talk.<br />A lot of people also like to bash them for not speaking english, which does impart a slightly strange sound to their singing, but thats not a bad thing in any sense. Actually I think its something good, it adds another side to the sound, but even if they were just singing while beating on pots and pans this album would still be great because unlike basically any other pop-rock act in the world they actually have lyrics that are pleasant to listen to. <br />Its full of bittersweet imagery and jumps from manically happy to the dark depths of depression. If you like music at all then at least one song on this album is for you, and no matter what your style preferences it will grow on you until you love all of it.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|I heard Rufus Wainwright sing at the Bottom Line in NYC back in early 2001, along with his mother and aunt, the McGarrigles.  He sang a few numbers, including the one he did in Moulin Rouge, which sadly was barely heard. Too bad.  It was astounding.  His voice is beautiful.  But he spent the night gettng toasted with a glass of red  wine while he sang.  I've read a couple of other interviews that make me hope Mr. Wainwright takes care of himself so he's around a long time.
B000001FI7|5.0|The one drawback to this album might be that listening to it for too long can cause a 'sympathetic depression'. I, however, find the saddness of this album to be almost theraputic and indisputably beautiful. <br />Of all the albums Portishead has put out this is by far the best, and although I can't wait until they turn out another studio album, I think its impossible for them to top this one.
B000002KXV|5.0|I bought &quot;The Nightfly&quot; on CD in 1992 after reading about it in Stereophile magazine.  They listed  it as having amazing production values and being one of their all-time Desert Island Disc-type records.  And it didn't disappoint.  But after hearing this on DVD-Audio, I'm giving away the CD.  <br />I won't go into the background of this concept  album, which other reviewers have detailed very nicely.  Instead, I'd point out that this is a stunning example of how good music can sound, even in 2-channel DVD-A.  <br />There's a format war going on between DVD-Audio and SACD.  I guess there's room for both.  But from my standpoint, DVD-A makes more sense, since even those people with conventional DVD players can play DVD-A discs.  They won't get the full benefit without an actual DVD-A player. But they'll have a nice collection when they eventually upgrade.  There is something like 60 times more information being transmitted with DVD-A.  And this disc is a great start if you want to experience how good 2-channel or 5.1 sounds.
B000003TSP|5.0|This entire album reminds me of a dark, foggy street with a single man standing under a streetlight far away. You know he's watching you, but you don't know why....<br />It's a fantastic, dark, and surreal musical landscape, and although its nowhere near as good as their first album (Dummy) its still amazing.<br />Buy Dummy first, and if it hits you the same way it has me, then go for this album too.
6305897786|4.0|From the day The Ninth Gate was released theatrically, it was a criminally underrated film that was bashed by critics and ignored at the box office.  However, what lies in The Ninth Gate is a creepy, atmospheric suspense/horror film that is more than worth a watch.  Johnny Depp stars as a rare book authenticator named Dean Corso, who becomes employed by a demonologist played by Frank Langella to authenticate a rare book that, according to legend, was written by the devil.  Corso ends up going across Europe when he uncovers a vast conspiracy to find the book, and Depp is at his most cynical in his role.  If it wasn't for Depp than The Ninth Gate would lose most of it's charm; one of the reasons I like Depp so much as an actor is the eclectic roles he takes in some of the daring films he has done.  Films which he powered like Edward Scissorhands, Nick of Time, Sleepy Hollow, and Dead Man are all films that most actors wouldn't dare take a role in, but Depp has always been a daring actor, and The Ninth Gate belongs in that category.  Director Roman Polanski uses some great camera work and the creeped out atmosphere adds to the film, along with the fact that the atmosphere makes you feel like you never know what is lurking around the corner or is just outside the frame of the camera, all of which adds to the suspense making The Ninth Gate a great thriller.  All in all, if your a fan of Depp or horror/suspense films in general than you should definitely check out this film.
B0000019HU|5.0|As a Pumpkins fan, I discovered this album by way of Billy Corgan's new band Zwan, in which Slint's Dave Pajo now plays.  Via articles I heard how good Spiderland was, and had to check it out.  A mate finished downloading it two days ago for me, and I can't take it out of my CD player.  I've read the other reviews below, and they're right.  This record is incredible.<BR>It took a couple of listens to really get it, but now I've made it inside this record I'm not sure how to get out.<BR>If you don't own it, and you like rock/guitar/indie/alternative music, you should.  After two days this has become one of my favourite records, and I'm not sure how to go back to anything else.  This is what music is about.<BR>In England, Zwan's new record comes out tomorrow.  I was going to go get it, but not sure I'll bother now.  Think I'll stay in and listen to this instead.
1400031346|5.0|You'll love it all! The descriptions the characters and, above all, the story. The author writes with such beautiful simplicity that you won't want to put it down till it's all done. That's a guarantee.  If you've ever been interested in Africa, you just can't miss this one. I eager to see what comes next. A definite must!! And if you're looking for a few other great titles, look no further than these, Buckland's Hot List: most creative, The Butterfly: A Fable (Singh); most engaging, The Alchemist (Coelho); most interesting, Life of Pi (Martel); most enlightening, 9-11 (Chomsky); most thrilling, The Lovely Bones: A Novel (Sebold); and finally, the most creative, engaging, interesting, enlightening and thrilling book of all, The Little Prince (Saint-Exupery). These are the books I'd recommend to my family, friends, students, and wife. There are many more, trust me, but these are the first that come to mind (for having left an impact slight or proud as it may be). If you have any questions, queries, or comments, or maybe even a title you think I should add to my list, please feel free to e-mail me. I'm always open to a good recommendation. Thanks for reading my brief but hopefully helpful review. Happy reading. Donald S. Buckland.
B00005QK39|5.0|Marillion begun with Script for a Jesters Tear, a very moving album that any desperate, lonely, heart broken young man can relate too. This one packs a punch! Fish is a great singer and anyone who loves real music will need to own this album. The double cd is great with an extra cd of b sides and alternative versions of songs, plus a huge ooklt full of pictures and stories. Marilion are one of my favorite bands of all time!
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I'll use this review to say things that no one else has pointed out yet. I was greeted with the New York, New York video on VH1 early one morning when I couldn't sleep. I took a minor chance on the album and bought it.....<br />Since then, I have also bought Gold on vinyl just to get the second disc because I couldn't find it on CD... I don't even have a record player, but if I get one, it's just to play this album. <br />One of the greatest songs ever is &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot; <br />This is the album of all albums for the new millenium, a twist on old music, done by young artists. This album should be placed on a pedastol and all new rock albums compared to it. <br />And to quote an old newspaper article that described a classic rock band's old live shows, &quot;Exaggeration? You cannot exaggerate perfection...&quot;<br />Need I say more?
B0000640VO|4.0|This otherwise wonderful movie has been spoiled by two very explicit sex scenes, which it could have really done very well without.  The story of Amelie is a touching one.  She is very lonely but is persuing a young man in a very unorthodox, shy manner, since she senses he could be her true love.  In the meantime she does things anonymously to help others.  This movie would have received five stars from me, were it not for the sex scenes, which do somehow ruin it, at least for me.
B000084T18|4.0|I never been the biggest fan of &quot;gangsta rap&quot;, but 50's album is undeniably fire. It had to be since he made one of the biggest power moves in a while by taking the leap to Shady/Aftermath and since he has about 1000 tracks in the chamber. &quot;In Da Club&quot; and &quot;Wanksta&quot; are killin' the radio right now, but they only give you part of 50's flow. This album is packed with even mo' jamz that re-visit his fluid, conversational flow of old, like the Dre-produced &quot;If I Can't&quot;, &quot;21 Questions&quot; featuring Nate Dogg, and the equally creative and ear-friendly &quot;Blood Hound&quot;. Don't think he is all about hits, though. He also sinks mad deep on the sadistic &quot;Heat&quot; and the mixtape-destined &quot;Back Down&quot;, where he says Ja &quot;sings for h**s and sounds like the cookie monster.&quot; Another plus for this album is G-Unit, who, unlike many crews, actually took the time to pen tight rhymes before stepping in the booth. Check Lloyd Banks on &quot;Don't Push Me&quot;, who manages to stand out even with the lyrically loco Eminem on the track. I had to take one star away since 50 lacks the depth of a 2Pac and falls just short of Biggie, plus the album needed a deeper posse cut. But 50 manages to drive his point home without having to get hoarse behind it like that other cat that could use a lozenge.
B00004YRQA|5.0|When I got my P.S.2 for Christmas, I got one of the memory cards with the load up disk.  Before I could play I had to start it up with the disk, then put the game in and wait even longer for the games to load.  With this one, you just put it in and start your game wich is very fast.  It is only 5 dollars more than the one with the disk, so this is a very good buy if you ask me.
B000001FI7|5.0|This album was a great addition to my collection.  It is definitely one of the best pieces of music I have ever heard.  Gibbons seems almost tortured on many of the tracks eliciting so much emotion its almost painful.  I was never a big fan of trip-hop, but this album has won me over.  I definitely recommend purchasing this album.  It not a great party album, but it good to listen too if your getting drunk by yourself after you found out your girlfriend cheated on you.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Living up to the allusion of its own title, I felt this movie was a dark and interesting look at how I might even reflect upon my own life.  It's unique examination of the perspective of a teenager who not only experiences torment but at the same time realizes his dreams.  The effect of the events portrayed in the ending are icing on the cake.  This movie is definitely worth a peek.
B00007E8V4|4.0|I'd give it 4.5 stars if it would let me.  It's just another great cd from System of a Down.  I've been a fan since the first cd, and some of the reviews I read I just don't understand.  Some people write that Toxicity was nowhere near as good the first cd.  To me, all three of their cd's pack the same punch, and that doesn't mean they sound the same.  My advice is buy this album and the other two if you don't have them.  Don't buy into reviews.  In fact, don't even buy into this one.  Find out for yourself.  There's a great chance you won't be disappointed.
B000084T18|4.0|After listening to this album, the wait has been definately worth it, there is not a moment that you ever think of fast forwarding a track. Listening to the lyrical skills that this emcee has got is like listening to &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; and sayin' to yourself &quot;Damn&quot; People will definately love him like they love Pac. 50 aslo shows us that he's not in it for the money but just to show the world there's a &quot;new&quot; thug in town! This album will give other so-called rappers a run for thier money!
B00005JLSC|4.0|The long-awaited and much-hyped movie version of Bob Fosse's theatrical production of \\"Chicago\\" will disappoint anyone looking for a deeply absorbing script - or sympathetic characters.  What does, ultimately, engage the viewer is the stirring, toe-tapping and booty-shaking delight of the music.  \\"Chicago\\" is a visceral, sensual sundae of inventive dance moves, excellent performances (Richard Gere's tap-dancing marvel halfway through the film drew applause the first time I saw the film) and songs that beg the listener (namely, myself) to sing along like a demi-diva on steroids.  The movie's standout song (or one of them) is \\"Cell Block Tango\\" - a tour de force of female angst and aggression that, while wholly unsympathetic in its tepid rationales for its protagonists' acts of murder, manages to interject wry humor and sardonic commentary into the stunning dance moves and memorable harmonies. \\"Overture/And All That Jazz\\" opens the film, and it and later performances quickly draw the audience in - even when the screenplay disappoints.  Queen Latifah was an excellent choice for the role of \\"Matron Mama Morton\\" - and she belts out \\"When You're Good to Mama\\" with conviction and confidence.  Kudos to all the musicians, songwriters and choreographers who created this fun and fearless film.  It ain't high drama, and it isn't exactly instructive.  The characters don't stay with you after the curtain closes - but the music sure does.  \\"Chicago\\" is a sensory delight - and sometimes that's just the elixir we need.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This album was great. I love every son on it; they have an awesome sound and great lyrics. Listening to this CD is uplifting, because the songs are filled with so mch energy. A must buy!!
B00003CXGG|5.0|This movie was great. It combined two vast worlds of hip hop and Martial Arts together...with the help of Aaliyah, Jet Li, DMX. The chemistry between Aaliyah and Jet is remarkable. The movie had a great story line and an ending which left the audience predicting... Overall, this movie is excellent. For this to be Aaliyah's first big screne acting primere, you would think that she has been in the movies for years. She becomes Trisha O'Day.
B000002ADT|5.0|If your looking for a reason to buy this album, you must be new to jazz idiom or perhaps, you just fell off the turnip truck.  Whatever the case, you can find great comfort in knowing that this is truly one of the greatest musical recordings of all time.  Why?  I'm not sure.  I doubt that a consensus will ever be met.<br />For years, jazz enthusiasts have mimicked each other in their praises of \\"Kind of Blue\\".  In fact, if I had a nickel for every time I heard that this was, \\"The best...\\" or some such phrase, I'd be independently wealthy.  Unfortunately, the system doesn't work that way.<br />I'm still not sold on the fact that this recording is the greatest of all time.  However, it's important to note that it may be impossible to cast that distinction on ANY one album.<br />Please DO buy this album and discover it for yourself as recording means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.<br />I suppose I should throw something in about Coltrane's haunting solos or Bill Evan's exquisite use of  space and time - both true pioneers of Modal Jazz.  But I'm sure that after you listen to this album for a few times, or a few thousand times you'll quickly form your own opinion.<br />I would suggest that this recording should be used as some kind of launching pad into the world of jazz.  Trust  me, you cannot overplay this album.  The true genius, that is Kind of Blue, is found in the masses of all that it influenced.  Like a ghost, its presence can be felt in a multitude of ways, by the artist that keep it alive.
0345350499|5.0|This is the best book - hands down.  Normally, I am not a fan of fiction.  In fact, I hate fiction.  But this book, &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; somehow slipped through my secure netting of truth (maybe because I love ancient European history).  I read this book about four years ago (I inherited it from a relative who loved it too and decided to share it) and have since worn it out from rereading it constantly.  There is no other book for the reader.  It has everything, literally - everything.  It is impossible to express how great this book is (though the rest of the series is not so hot).
0783222475|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies it pulls you right in, because it is so intense the graphics are very realistic and the chemistry is wonderful.
B000084T18|5.0|I got this cd the 1st day it came out and haven't stopped listenin to it. 50 Cent has done it again, and this is his best yet. If you haven't heard of Eminem's new rap prodigy then you don't know what your missing. He has a sound and style all his own, which is refreshing when all of rap seems to be soundin the same lately. Standout tracks are his latest radio release, &quot;In Da Club&quot;, &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;High All the Time&quot;. But thats not to say those are the only good songs, this is a cd that you can listen through the whole thing without havin to change a song. If your a fan of 50 Cent or even Eminem, then you have to run out and buy this cd.
0930289455|5.0|After you read this or anything else that Moore does (apart from his Image comics work) you will be hard-pressed to find stuff of close-caliber in superhero books.  Alan Moore is an amazing writer and if you are a fan or either him or Batman, you need to check this out.  But, like I said, Moore's is the best stuff in the industry and after tasting of the sweet nectar of a god, all the rest cannot compare.
6304806418|5.0|To say Evita is a difficult production is a gross understatement. Having done the stage production, I was prepared to dislike them movie, but was very pleasantly surprised. Superb castting and well researched and executed costumes and settings make this a movie to watch again and again.
0825303958|1.0|Best twisted children's story EVER.  I tricked you, you thought this was going to be negative, but I seriously don't know how you can't like this book unless you're some sort of fundamentalist (which I used to be, but thank, God, I got straightened out).  Gorey's art is fabulous black and white and his humor subtly subversive.  Seriously, it's only $$$, stop reading and just order it.
B000002L82|4.0|How could an album with no singles, no pictures of the band members or even mention of their names, and such a non-flashy album presentation be recognized as one of the seminal albums of the 1980's?? Well, this is one case where musical merit wins out over style. Being born a year after this release, I wouldn't know, but imagine being a fan of Joy Division and hearing about Ian Curtis' death. Then you find out about the remaining members forming New Order. You hear 'Movement' and it's got a lot of things you'd remembered from 'Closer' with a few added twists, such as more synthesizers. After a few singles (each getting increasingly more different), two years later comes 'Power Corruption & Lies', a very different sound than Joy Division and 'Movement'. It's kind of like that.<br />This is not to say that the album is without its flaws. A lot of the music is much more minimalist than later New Order releases, which to some people is either a curse or a blessing. The music is also somewhat positioned in-between their more dancy and their more minimalist sound, which makes this seem more like a transitional album. 'Age Of Consent' is really a sign of things to come for New Order. 'Leave Me Alone' and 'Your Silent Face' stand out as the most musically striking compositions (along with 'Age Of Consent') and make this album what it is. 'The Village' is definitely an escape from the gloom of their previous incarnation. While not the best New Order album (in this reviewers opinion) it is definitely a good album by any standards.<br />*** It is my guess that when Warner re-issued New Order's back catalogue in compact disc format, that 'Blue Monday' was stuck on here because the album had no singles on it and 'Blue Monday' and its b-side 'The Beach' were stuck on to make this album stand out to people who bought the original 12\\" or who knew this monster hit but didn't want to pay $$$ for 'Substance.'
1878574590|5.0|Best noir graphic novel, EVER.  If you are a Frank Miller fan already, you must've read this so I am not going to waste my time on you.  For those that aren't really familiar with Frank Miller or Sin City, this is the perfect introduction to both.  Dark, fun, and great-looking.  The high-contrast black vs white art perpetuates that feeling that you get from watching German Expressionistic films like Nosferatu or The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  And I personally am a junky for that fix.  Miller takes a very simple story set in a compelling setting of a fictional city where law is so tied with religion that the seedier elements in the city are all the more seedier.  So much fun to read, and such a classic milestone in graphic novels that if you are interested in American comics at all, you need to check this out.
0151008116|4.0|Altough I enjoyed PI, (and didn't have too much trouble buying into the Chef and Algae Island episodes) the final debriefing by authorities after Pi's rescue seemed to me less than credible.  This is no longer a fifteen year old speaking - and even given the maturation that such isolation and survival must have had on Pi - he shifts into a persona that is impossible to accept.  We've come too far with Pi as an ingenious and resourceful adolescent to cast him in the role of mystic guru even under the interrogation of such dolts.  The book shifts from the voice of Pi to the voice of Martel and it left me feeling betrayed.  Sorry, Yann, but even in allegories, characterization needs to remain consistent.
B0000013GT|5.0|This is the old school ATliens CD which in my opion was the best CD that OUTkast made. This CD was responsible for getting OUTKAST heard because it produced ... with a flow style that just made the party hip-to-the-hop. If you just got into OUTKAST recently and never heard this CD, you must get this cd immediatly!

B00005T33W|4.0|Based on the serialized comic book tale by Daniel Clowes, the film is based on two ultra-hip friends (Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson) who spend their summer after high school together contemplating the future. As Enid and Becky talk snobbishly and cynically about the world ahead of them, they're being watched, unbeknownst to them, by another person.  <br />The film does have some foul language , but does a good job mocking the hypocracy of liberals and the double standards that they have created.<br />Becky is forced to take  a sumemr school art class to fulfill her high school graduation requirements. The glass is run by a pseudo intellectual clinton supporter like art teacher who falls in love with a piece of art submitted by becky. The piece is actually an old poster art ad for a chicken restaurant chain once known as \\"Coon'S Chicken\\"  While the teacher does find artistic value and statement in the piece that is described as \\"found art\\" by becky.  She is offered a one year scholarship to arts school , only to have the same liberal like first ammendment loving liberals be outraged by beckys \\"found art piece\\" . <br />They cry foul and order the piece removed from the art show. The piece portrays a 30' era black man as a \\"coon\\" with bug lips and a clownish smile.<br />The same type crowd who would cheer anti christian art an would applaud a flag burning are \\"offended\\" by the piece and order the scolarship revoked and beckys grade be changed to an f. The liberal teacher caves and the writer has done an excellant job with  this in your face portrayel of liberals.
B000065V3H|5.0|This movie absolutely rules.  Although Patrick Dempsey plays his part pretty well, this movie is all about Amanda Peterson.  She is the chick you watched from afar in high school but wouldn't dare to even speak to.  Amanda is so hot in this film it's amazing her career didn't really go anywhere.  At least we have this movie and, through Ronald, can live the life we wish we lived in high school... he got the girl.  Damn.

0375414053|5.0|While some working moms may feel that this book was meant to push the message \\"a working mom is a bad mom\\" I don't believe that was the message at all! I believe the writer meant to emphasize the message that we working moms put entirely TOO much pressure on ourselves trying to \\"do it all\\" and worrying what everyone else thinks of us.  Do our kids look at us differently if we don't bake homemade bread and pies?  I think not!   I am a working mom in a very male dominated job, and I saw a LOT of myself and my coworkers in this book.  I laughed out loud when Kate mentions that she learned to handle her boss and coworkers as she does her toddler and that as long as she lets her boss think he came up the ideas, things get done the way she wants them to. I also agreed with her when she mentions that everyone thinks it is wonderful when one of the male coworkers takes time off for a child's play, but when she does it, they feel she is \\"slacking off\\"  I have felt the same feelings.  I hope everyone enjoys this book as much I did!

B00004TLN3|2.0|As I understand it, the book NORTHANGER ABBEY was Jane Austen's one attempt at a Gothic satire - vastly different from her comedic novels built around Regency polite society, period manners, and notions of courtship and romance. If this film version (for the British telly) of NORTHANGER ABBEY is an accurate indicator, Jane should have stuck with her day job.<br />Katherine Schlesinger stars as Catherine Morland, a genteel adolescent sent off to the spa city of Bath to tarry awhile with good friends, Mr. and Mrs. Allen (Geoffrey Chater and Googie Withers respectively). Of course, right off one can see a difference between NA and PRIDE & PREJUDICE, SENSE & SENSIBILITY, MANSFIELD PARK, and EMMA, where the storylines evolve principally in rural manor houses. While in Bath, the Allen's make every effort to introduce Catherine to \\"society\\". Two of those that befriend her are Henry Tilney (Peter Firth) and his sister Eleanor (Ingrid Lacey), who eventually invite her to sleep over at the family manor, NORTHANGER ABBEY, presided over by their widowed father, General Tilney (Robert Hardy). This is where the satire comes in.<br />Catherine and her impressionable girlfriends are absorbed in one particular Gothic novel - a contemporary best seller, so to speak - that has an illustration of the heroine at the mercy of the ogreish master of a gloomy estate. Anyway, Catherine has delicious nightmares of being in a similar situation extrapolated to the point where the peril to her virtue seems at hand after the dreamworld villain carries her upstairs during a violent storm, then leers suggestively after tossing her onto a bed. These dreams work on Catherine's overwrought imagination such that, while at NORTHANGER ABBEY, she begins to suspect that the creepy general had something to do with the sudden death of his wife. The connection between the two scenarios seems dodgy, but the point of Ms. Austen's satire was \\"Oh, puhleeze!\\" That, at least, I can agree with.<br />For me, the main problem with this film was that absolutely none of the characters were engaging or particularly interesting. Miss Morland is the epitome of the wide-eyed Silly Girl whose foolishness knows no limits. Moreover, the screenplay was borrrring from beginning to end, the soundtrack was melodramatic to the point of campiness, and the ending was so low key as to be almost invisible. (I didn't realize the conclusion had arrived until the credits rolled. A nice surprise, in retrospect.) Good heavens, what was the BBC thinking when it produced this drivel? It makes the cinematic versions of Austen's other works released in the 1990s, more clever by far, look comparatively like the greatest films ever made. The only positive note was the use of the romantically moated, 14th century Bodiam Castle in Kent for the exterior shots of Northanger Abbey.n problem with this film was that absolutely none of the characters were engaging or particularly interesting.

0671027344|5.0|This book was a great experience and I recomend it to any teenager or adult.  It is the gross reality of how painful and wonderful being a teenager can be.  I fell in love with the narrator Charlie who wrote letters of his life.  He is a deeply honest and good person.  And his unique style of writing makes the book even more real seeming.  He writes like he would talk and doesn't try and doesn't use big words that people would never say in thier everyday conversations. He is a simple boy that most people can relate to in some way.
B000001ESJ|4.0|Rush had found themselves as a band with their 1976 breakthrough prog-rock classic, 2112. The following year, they released this disc, A Farewell To Kings, a loose conceptual piece that finds the band further exploring just what they could do compositionally and instrumentally. Here, they do it quite well.<BR>The album starts off in a way that probably surprised fans -- a gentle classical guitar with Moog synth and chimes to accentuate the mood. Then the band pause and kick into the title track. The song is not the best, but sets the tone for the rest of the album with its sudden changes and complex arrangement.<BR>The band's addition of a wider range of sounds -- guitarist Alex Lifeson's use of doubleneck and classical guitars, bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee's addition of synths, and drummer Neil Peart's array of new percussion toys, such as the aforementioned chimes, along with woodblocks, gongs, and a xylophone -- created a much larger canvas for their most ambitious work to date. The full potential of that can be heard in the grandeur of the classic Xanadu. It clocks in at about 11 minutes, and glistens with a cinematic vista of sounds and moods. It is arguably one of the finest moments in Rush's prog era, if not their whole career.<BR>The token 'hit' can be found here to balance out the album's longer pieces in the form of the 2.52 bittersweet Rush standard Closer To the Heart. It cracked the Top 100 and gave Rush a bit of airplay, but it was their live shows and albums that were making the most impact. Still, the simplicity and idealism of the track about making a better future for our world is, if not naive, then atleast catchy. <BR>The album continues with another catchy mid-tempo rocker called Cinderella Man, with lyrics penned by Lee (all the other lyrics are by drummer Neil Peart). It contains a nice acoustic guitar line and an interesting middle section. <BR>The only clunker here is Madrigal, which sounds a bit corny and forced. Thankfully, it is short.<BR>The album ends with the magnus opus Cygnus X-1, another futuristic sci-fi inspired gem in the same vein as 2112, only much shorter than that 20 minute + track. Cygnus runs at about 10 minutes, and contains one of the best prog-rock riffs ever, highlighted by the fat, slapped basswork of the formidable Lee. The song then literally blasts off into the outer reaches of space as the storyline takes the listener into the 'heart of Cygnus', a blackhole. The song ends with our hero being sucked into the blackhole and the lyric sheet inside the album says \\"To be continued\\". Guess you have to buy the next album to learn what happens, right?<BR>The production here is nice. The guitars are still heavy, but have a cleaner, leaner sound. Everything is taut, and some could call it cold, in its execution. But this is not Bread. This is Rush, and you get everything that made them cool back then here. Geddy Lee's shrieks, Neil Peart's idealistic lyrical musings and octopus-like drumming, and Alex Lifeson's strong able rock guitar atmospeheres. If you don't like Rush, this album is not really going to change that fact. But if you are into prog-rock, or want to learn more about a uniquely bizarre rock band, this is a good disc to have.
B000002UR7|5.0|OK, I'm not one of these guys who religiously collects every album and piece of memorabilia ever rolled off the production line by Radiohead, but I have enjoyed their music for as long as I can remember. This is truly all I can remember, sheerly as a result of it's (for want of a better word) &quot;Radioheadness&quot;. <BR>This album seems to have been designed without any of the constraints of your modern day &quot;Arty&quot; artists. It's sheer balls to the wall stuff, which can easily be directly reproduced live with no loss of quality. What's more is that all songs therein have that now forgotten concept of the riff, that little piece of a song which will make you remember it forever. For example, &quot;Creep&quot;, who's ever going to forget this hard hitting, creative piece? It is a perfect concoction of Jonny Greenwood's everlasting dive into the deep crevasse of musical originality, and Thom Yorke's expansive lyrical imagination.<BR>&quot;Creep&quot; is not the only colourful song on the album, that's for sure. &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot; and... well pretty much every other title on the album has that Radioheadesque charm and impact.<BR>The song which really hit me hard was &quot;Blow Out&quot;, just because it's one of the last tracks on the album does not mean that it's no good. God no, this song is so dynamic and beautiful that it brings me to goosepimples every time I hear it. The transition from floaty and jazzy to hard and, well, perfect, works beautifully. It'd a difficult song to describe, but it really is fantastic.<BR>In a way of summing up Pablo Honey, this isn't something you're going to like if you're more of a &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; kind of person. But if you sway towards &quot;The Bends&quot;, you're missing out on something big, I mean huge.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is one of the greatest Beatles' CDs it has the great poetic and meaningful lyrics of the post 1965 albums but it still has the boyish charm of the earlier ones. In our current time of one hit wonders and fame based on looks instead of talent its refreshing to hear music that means something and still sounds really cool.When you sit down and listen to it you just feel good inside and if your like me you realize even more why The Beatles are one of the worlds greatest rock groups.

B00004TDRD|5.0|Jaws, 1975 film   It is night on the ocean. A buoy clangs its warnings. Young people are sitting around a campfire at night. A couple goes to the water's edge. The girl goes in alone and finds an unpleasant surprise. She screams, then all is quiet. The next morning a man gets a telephone call. There are body parts on the beach, with crabs. What will they do? Amity Island is a small town that depends on summer tourism, the Town Council does not want the beaches closed. Will the truth be covered up? We see people in the water. &#34;That's some bad hat, Harry.&#34; Where did that dog go? &#34;Did you see that?&#34; People rush from the water. Where is Alex? The Town Council wants this nes suppressed. Will they close the beaches? One man offers to catch the shark for $10,000. Quint says &#34;you know me&#34;.   Chief Brody does research on sharks. Two men try to catch a shark with bait. The dock collapses! &#34;Swim, Charlie, swim!&#34; They can go home now. People volunteer to hunt this shark. Matt Hooper from the Ocean Institute arrives. Its not a boat accident, it's a very large squalus. One shark was caught. Hooper measures its mouth for the bite radius. Mrs. Kintner objects to Chief Brody's failure to close the beach. Can you believe the reports on the news? Most shark attacks are about ten feet from shore in three feet of water. The shark is still out there. The boat sails at night. They find a small boat. Hooper gets a shock! &#34;It's a great white.&#34; The Mayor's politics override any warnings. Brody says they need men with guns and boats. Tourists arrive for the July Fourth weekend. All seems peaceful, but nobody is in the water yet. Some boys go sailing in the pond, others in the ocean. The people see something in the water. You see the reactions as they race for the beach. False alarm?   The shark appears in the pond and gets a man. Larry seems confused, but he will sign the voucher. Quint presents his terms for hunting the shark. Hooper will go along on this fishing expedition. [Note how the story changes focus here.] They throw bait into the water to attract sharks (&#34;chumming&#34;). Noise from the reel sends a signal: a bite on the line. They change course. Brody sees the shark. Quint and Hooper compare scars in a bonding ceremony. We hear about the USS Indianapolis in 1945. It was torpedoed and only 316 of the 1,100 survived. Then bumping noises alarms them, something is hitting the boat.   Quint fires a rifle into the sea to no effect. A barrel floats close to the boat. The shark is back. Quint puts another harpoon and barrel into the shark. Tying the line to the boat? There is a problem with the boat. Hooper will try to stab the shark in the mouth. [Sounds easy?] The shark-proof cage is lowered into the ocean. What if it fails? The shark attacks the cage! Next it attacks the stern and weighs it down. Quint slides towards it. Brody throws a tank of compressed air. The ship lists to port. Brody climbs to mast with his Garand. He spears the shark. Next he shoots at it. One shot hits the air tank for an explosive result. The shark leaves the half-sunken boat. There is a new development for a happy ending. [What's next?]   Note the message from the ending to this story. Was it an echo of &#34;Moby Dick&#34;? Why should the most experienced sailor be the lone victim? Its still a good movie, but not as impressive after 35 years. Note the presence of firearms, would they do that today? [Shouldn't Quint have used an exploding harpoon to finish off that shark? It kills bigger fish.]   I wonder why Quint didn't take any explosives along. An exploding harpoon would have quickly ended the attack; it kills the much large whales. The use of a military rifle to kill the monster must have kept this film off broadcast TV for many years. One version used electronic editing to remove the guns used in the early part of this film! This reflects the corporate politics for gun prohibition, and the mocking of the armed people who respond to the threat of the shark. There were attacks along the Jersey Shore in 1916. There are two books that go into more detail. Note the freedom to keep and bear arms then.

B000002GQG|5.0|This album could be the most exquisite and fantastical album ever written by this band. The entire album flows together as one, making it a journey through exotic soundscapes. From cascading harps, to journeys through the jungle, through mysterious territory, to paradise and on to the meaning within ourselves. A creative earthy experience is in store throuout the album as it flows gently through mystical truth and excursions. Wonderful melodys with acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and eastern insturments (tabla and Sitar), enhance the beauty and create an album completely different than any other  they have accomplished. To me this is the best album and always provides a fantastic listening experience.<br />Ben.<BR>the 15 year old.
B00005A46T|5.0|I've listened to many songs, and none of them have the raw punctuality of this cd. From People=S**t to the thought-provoking Iowa, which implies the lyrics were written by a murderer (not that they were). Great intensity; sweet for those who enjoy heavy, heavy metal. Some songs get old, but the great ones more than make up for it. Here are my individual ratings for each track:<br />1 - (515): Signature intro track(funny the way the shrieks cutoff)<BR>2 - People=S**t: Absolutely great. 'Chorus' is really cool.  The song has a wind up sound effect like a futuristic generator.<BR>3 - Disasterpiece: Not exactly my cup of anthrax. Some lyrics don't make sense.<BR>4 - My Plague: Great. Gets old after a while, but still is cool.<BR>5 - Everything Ends: OK. It can get old, but I liked it.<BR>666 - The Heretic Anthem: Fabulous. High intensity; great use of sound equipment.<BR>7 - Gently: Slowly builds up, but then masses. Great ambience music for headphones<BR>8 - Left Behind: Great. Lyrics are spoken in a way which increases the wonderful intensity of the song.<BR>9 - The Shape: Great song with good lyrics.<BR>10 - I Am Hated: One of my favorite songs. Lyrics are excellent, and everything else rules too.<BR>11 - Skin Ticket: Very odd(even for me). Lyrics are near-none, and music is sparse. A 'lite' song.<BR>12 - New Abortion: Starts off with a heavy beat. Great. Lyrics are nothing next-gen, but are great to listen to.<BR>13 - Metabolic: OK. Music is great. However lyrics are lacking in structure.<BR>14 - Iowa: The title track. And it has every right to be. A concervitave person would probably have a heart attack if they read the lyrics. Sounds kind of creepy, but mostly doors slamming and vultures. Controversial, but still an awesome song, if long though.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD was given to my husband &amp; I as a surprise Christmas gift.   At first listen, we were intriqued by Norah's unique voice but weren't immediately captivated.  By the end of the second listen, we were hooked and are now recommending it everyone we know.

B00005JKDR|5.0|If you have small children, movies such as this are worth their weight in gold: the kids love it (our two year old can barely start the day without at least seeing scare trainee Mr. Vile whose friends call him &quot;Phlegm&quot; and his ill-fated run through the bedroom simulation), and since the kids love it, you'd better get used to the idea of YOU watching it OVER AND OVER AGAIN.<br />And here Monsters, Inc. (along with the Toy Story movies and the outstanding Shrek) really shows its mettle: even for my (somewhat addled) parental brain, this film stands up to repeated scrutiny: I think I could probably recite the entire script verbatim and I still get a kick out of it.<br />Partly it's the characterisation - Goodman and Crystal are as good as you'd expect, but the secondary characters are their equal - the adolescent door shredders and, of course, Mr. Vile are amongst my favourites. Every aspect of the film rates highly: the script pops and fizzes (probably thanks to Crystal's ad-libbing), the computer rendering is brilliant (though I still say Shrek is the undisputed CGI heavyweight championship of the world), and the grand scheme of the film - its look and feel, is just remarkable.<br />Viewers who complain that the darker aspects of the story weren't adequately explored seem to have missed the fact that, first and foremost, this is a story for very small children. And besides, there's no way I'm marking down a film that guarantees me a half-hour lie-in on a Sunday morning just because it isn't nasty enough.<br />Two nitpicks (neither of which rob the film of the five stars it deserves): Firstly, the standard version I bought isn't the full widescreen version (this wasn't made clear on the tin, and even if it was, it is a curious and rather cynical decision on Disney's part), and secondly, to get the movie to play you have to scroll through a bunch of other Disney trailers - there seems to be no way to avoid these (other than impatiently cueing through them). This is standard Disney practice - although what they think it will achieve is beyond me, no matter what they do I'M NOT BUYING TARZAN - and it is irritating as hell.<br />But as soon as the family sees Mr. Vile hopping round the room frantically removing jacks from his arse, all is forgiven.This is standard Disney practice - although what they think it will achieve is beyond me, no matter what they do I'M NOT BUYING TARZAN - and it is irritating as hell.<br />But as soon as the family sees Mr. Vile hopping round the room frantically removing jacks from his arse, all is forgiven.

068484267X|5.0|This is a marvellous book. An exceptional story, well narrated by an exceptional writer. It made me laugh. It brought tears to my eyes. What's remarkable is that it isnt funny and tragic by turn - but both simultaneously. You develop an insight into almost each of the characters that inhabit the pages. Cannot wait to read Tis. Or anything else Frank McCourt may write.

B00005JLEX|5.0|The language of the Seinfeld series has become a part of popular culture (like Cheers, MASH, or the Honeymooners) as people often quote lines or situations from the show.  Likewise, since Seinfeld's creation, everyone has probably experienced a daily situation that would make a great episode on Seinfeld.  I personally remember some of the daily annoyances from the show, like getting soup from a rude owner, having someone talking too close, trying to pick up a \\"reserved\\" rental car, or watching someone do a dance that's really odd.  I know that I have experienced similar daily annoyances and have simply thought to myself, \\"what a Seinfeld-ism.\\"  Every now and then, I think of a specific episode of Seinfeld that I want to view; however, even my homemade videos of various episodes doesn't really help, because I don't know which episodes (from which season) are on which video.  So, they continue to sit and collect dust.  <br />Since many other tv series and sitcoms (Friends, the Sopranos, Sex in the City, The X Files, and 24) have been selling newly released DVDs and video tapes of their show by seasons, I figured that Seinfeld would NATURALLY be out on the shelves a LONG TIME AGO.  However, I can't find them anywhere.  I really hope the creators of the show will soon publish/produce such a DVD with all of the sucessful seasons.  I would certainly buy all of them in a heartbeat because it's great to laugh at the daily routines humans seem to have.
B00005Q66T|4.0|This is a great compilation of Madonna's work.  The songs are great and will get you up on your feet and dancing in no time.  Some might even bring back some fond memories; Ah, how the years fly by.  Although all are radio edits I still found myself enjoying the album and if you don't want to buy every CD Madonna has released this one then is a must; it will give you a great overview of the woman's ability.  I didn't give it five stars though for two reasons.  One, there are no new tracks to accompany the hits like there was on the Immaculate collection CD; and two, she left out songs which should have been included on here.  Where is American Pie?  You'll see?  And what about a remix or two like you did on your first Greatest hits.  Still I highly recommend it; especially if you do own Immaculate Collection; together they make a great set and will give you hours of great music.
B00005CDNJ|5.0|This is one of the best albums Abba recorded. Like some of the others, I bought it originally on vinyl, then upgraded to CD, then bought the re-mastered CD with three bonus tracks (including Gimmie gimmie gimmie, not listed on this edition but readily available on Abba compilations), but ignored the latest digipack version.<br />Two British number one hits came from this album. The first, Winner takes it all, is a very sad song about the break-up of a relationship. It was inspired by a marriage break-up within Abba, but was not itself autobiographical. As they admit, neither partner came out winners from the divorce. The song hits home hard, perhaps because Agnetha really felt the song. The second number one, Super trouper, is more typical Abba - very upbeat.<br />My favorite tracks are The piper, The way old friends do and Our last summer. The piper was put on the B-side of Super trouper. I felt that was a mistake - it would have made a great A-side. In fact, they could have used Put on your white sombrero as a B-side - it was dropped from the album and had only rarely been made available before its inclusion here. The way old friends do is a live recording which provided a great finale to the original album. With the bonus tracks, it no longer has that effect, but is still a great song.<br />Elaine was the original B-side of Winner takes it all but, like Put on your white sombrero, had rarely been available before, although both could be found on a 4-CD boxed set.<br />I thought Our last summer could have been a great single, but the only other British single to be released from the album was Lay all your love on me backed with On and on and on. They had proved popular on dance floors so were made available on twelve-inch format only.
B000002BYD|4.0|On pearl jam's 5th album we find doing a more grounded,more old shcool style album. Unlike the experimental elements of \\"vitology\\" and \\"no code\\", with yeild we find a more mellow version of pearl jam, with the exception of 6 some odd songs. Of course yeild has it's share of duds, it has it's share of in my opoion, pearl jams best tunes to date. Yeild not only being one of my favorote rock albums and my 3rd favorite pearl jam album starts off with tunes such as \\"brain of J\\" and \\"faithfull\\". What better way to start off a rock/alternative album with two very impressive tunes? While \\"no way\\" reminds me of something off of vitology, that song really to this day does not impress me. But \\"given to fly\\", well besides from sounding eirly like led zepplins \\"going to calliforinia\\" is awsome, with full of emotion vocals from ed vedder(as he now calls himself)and very rythimic guitars. While the middle part of the album pretty much falls into very mellow ballads, mostly acoustic oriented. Tunes such as \\"whishlist\\" \\"pilate\\", both of witch are pretty good, and wishlist as being probably one of pearl jams most flamboyant songs next to \\"even flow\\". Then you get into the later half of yeild and goes pretty much with the same formula, but definetly has some very nice tunes such as the laid back ballads \\"MFC\\" \\"lowlight\\" and \\"all those yesterdays\\". While \\"in hidning\\" as being one of my all time favorite pearl jam tunes with it's mellow/rocking formula and at the end a very neat little riff. I would definetly recomend yeild to new pearl jam fans and rock fans.

0694003611|5.0|This book has been an absolute blessing for our toddler.  We use to have a hard time getting her to bed at night but now when we say we'll read her the Goodnight Moon book she runs to bed.  It truly is a classic!  I recommend this board book over the paper version because if your child likes it the pages won't tear.  Much more durable.  Can't say enough about this book and we are a big book family.  We have a membership to a book club but of all the books this has been the best one yet.  And after a long day, it doesn't take forever to read.

B00005NOOH|5.0|I remember watching this series with my family when I was growing up almost 30 years ago. I've never forgotten it. And it's just as interesting and compelling<br />today as it was all those years ago. Jeremy Isaacs direction is superb and focused. Sir Laurence Olivier's narraration is so majestic, it's hard to describe in words. You get a well rounded story from all sides (American, British, Russian,<br />French, Italian, German, Japanese, military, civilian,etc.). The DVD transfer is wonderful, the films of the interviews were obviously kept in good hands. Carl Davis' music score is great and dramatic and is presented in Dolby 2.0 digital. There's extras like timelines, maps, shortcuts to songs, photo galleries for each episode and  an<br />introduction by Mr. Isaacs for each episode.<br />You'll also come to the conclusion that some things never change- how America wanted no part of WWII. There were protests against fighting Hitler and Mussolini all across the Nation. Just like now. The situatuion was hard for Roosevelt, but the Japanese made his decision easier on December 7, 1941.<br />All in all, a timeless reminder of why war is so horrific, and at times, necessary

This man has worked to get what he wanted. Being orphined at eight, being shot nine times, being stabbed, and selling crack, this man cannot be brought down. Get this album while they are still shipping the DVDS in the package! biography, music video, and more! All he needs to do now is watch his back, not get shot again. im out payce

0375414053|4.0|Alison Pearson's missive on the trials and tribs of the working mom is a total laugh-riot! I highly recommend it and believe that any working mom will be able to relate to this compelling and heart-warming book -- I laughed, I cried, my husband thought I was nuts. Some past reviewers seem to have taken this book as something of a criticism of the working mum.  It is important to remember that this is a comic novel -- take it with a spoonful of cynicism and a generous helping of self-depricating humor.  If you can't step back and chuckle at the absurdities of the juggling that go on in the working mum's life, including your own, than this book is not for you.  For me, it was a mirror image of my family's zany life, and a great escape hatch!

B00000IPAX|4.0|Wow, I've had Take Off Your Pants and Jacket for the longest time, but I had yet to buy Enema of the State.  What was I waiting for?  This is a great cd, and I can't believe I didn't get it sooner.  There are some famous songs on here, but the best are the ones that I hadn't heard before, like 'Going Away To College' and 'Anthem'.  My favorite song by and far is 'Mutt' (absolutely hilarious!).  Anwyay, I think this is an entertaining cd, and the enhanced part of it lets you see a pretty funny bonus video (with some very 'nifty' dancing on Tom's part)!
B00000JMQE|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was broadcast on the Disney Channel when I was in Kindergarten or first grade. At the time I was just starting my massive Oz phase (which lasted several years) wherein I set out to read every Oz book ever published.<br />I loved this movie. I owned copy of this movie that we had taped off television up until I wore the tape out years later.<br />Fast forward about fifteen years. I had nearly forgotten all about this until I happened to stumbled across the aged and worn out tape in our videocassette library. I instantly knew I had to find this on DVD. Fortunately Amazon had it and I bought it.<br />I'm glad I did. Watching again after not having seen it for over a decade brought back a whole lot memories and I remembered why I loved it in the first place.<br />People, whose only experience with Oz is through the Garland movie, will be in for a surprise. It's certainly a lot darker than they would expect, but anyone who read Baum's original books would know that Oz was never a technicolor place all the time.<br />The DVD itself is decent. The video and audio quality is not a high as most current movies but I believe it's because it was transferred from original (and aging) film stock. There isn't much in the way of extras other than a segment of Fairuza Balk fondly reminiscing on making the movie.<br />As a child-hood fan of this movie I was certainly glad that the studio chose to release it like this after all these years. And I'm definitely glad I bought it.
6305736650|5.0|While the Maltese Falcon has always been my favorite Bogie film, Casablanca is all its said to be and more. Helping his lover and her husband escape a Nazi infested Casablanca, keeps Bogie juggling relationships with the French Prefect (Reins) as well as his love interest (Bergman). Great is perhaps an understatement.
0316666343|2.0|What a let-down. This book was so one-dimensional. Sebold places Susie in heaven, where she can see what everybody is doing, hear what they're thinking, and feel what they're feeling. How convenient. Susie was raped and killed but she's not too upset about it. Then she goes to heaven and sits in her gazebo and watches tv (the drama on earth) all day long and narrates it to you. In time, her family moves on, but there's no indication that Susie has. The mystery was never solved, so there's no closure. Since Susie can't tell anybody where to find her bones, a simple ending is contrived just so there's some ending. But wait! She did have a chance! She incredibly gets to live in a human body again for a few minutes. You would think she would go and comfort her long-suffering family or lead the police to the evidence, but she spends all her precious time ...her crush.<br />This is a novel about Susie, and we get inside everyone's heads except Susie's. (And we had to get inside everyone's bodies too.) She doesn't do anything, she just tells you what others do. She doesn't feel anything, she just tells you what others feel.<br />It'll be a long time before I read fiction again. Btw, if like me, you picked up this book because you're curious about what people do in heaven, you'd be better off reading \\"In Her Own Words: The After-Death Journal of Princess Diana\\" by Christine Toomey. That's the real stuff.
B00006LPER|2.0|Ok, first, I like foreign movies, and I especially like French foreign films. They just have a different way of doing things, cinematography etc...  But this film was really really bad.  <br />There really is no character development, you are just to take these vapid characters with extreme problems at face value. The main charcter is a piano teacher with deviant sexual eccentricities, and thats putting it lightly.  Follow her through this film while she tries to make everyone and everything that she touches as sad and lonely as she is. She's a mean woman and it's just not entertaining to watch her spy on young lovers at the drive in, and then urinate next to their car while shes in sexual climax, nor is it interesting to watch her sabotage the young career of one of her students by putting crushed glass in her coat pocket. The only up side to this film is the romantic tendencies of her persuer who, for reasons unknown, is attracted to this woman at any cost. <BR>She's a nasty woman with serious problems.<BR>This film does not resolve a conflict, it abruptly ends.  <BR>I would not recommend this film to anyone.
B000031XCR|5.0|I truly enjoyed listening to this album.  It was very nice to hear how Celine has grown and matured in voice and material over the years.  This album has replayability galore!  There are a couple &quot;oopsies&quot; on this record, but overall it's 5 stars!
B0000039QA|5.0|Biggie had it all- all the fame, fortune and glory endowed on those at the top of the rap game. Even then, he was unable to pull out of the gangsta way of life. So, unfortunately, he left us with only 3 albums showcasing his verbal assault he unleashed, venting his fury at the only way of life he ever knew. Ready to Die is a standout album, but Life After Death tops it easily, thanks to being 2 discs. Notorious Thugs, Nasty Boy,and Somebody's Got to Die all compete for title of best song on this recording, with Hypnotize, Sky's the Limit and Fu**** u Tonight bringing in the second wave. A top notch album that maintains its significance almost six years after its release, Ready to Die is a must have cd.
B000069HK2|3.0|The Used are a mix between Good Charlotte and Finch. I don't find them very interesting.
B0000029GA|5.0|Forgive me, hip hop world, because I made a monumental mistake. For some reason I still cant figure out, I slept on this album for about 5 years after it was released.Of course, I heard all the talk about how it was the best hip hop album ever made, so one day I picked it up.I was impresed. I dont think it ranks at the top of the overall list, but this album is extraordinary in its own right.The entire album flows together, showcasing a blessed poet rhyming over music. Cuts like Halftime and N.Y. State of Mind paint vivid pictures of Nasir Jones young life. The standout Lifes a Bit** with AZ is a hip hop jewel shinier than most. While Nas' recent releases Stillmatic and Gods Son are quality recordings, it would take an absolutely perfect album to eclipse this as Nas' best effort.
0060920386|5.0|Even as times change, the way business is conducted does not.  Business dealings at the highest levels are still usually about fame and egos rather than what is good business sense.  It is within this context that the outstanding Barbarian at the Gates, by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, has been written.  This fascinating and detailed account, by the Wall Street Journal reporters who initially reported the case, gives insight into corporate power struggles to buy RJR Nabisco back in the late 1980's.<br />More specifically, the story involves Rob Johnson, the then CEO of RJR Nabisco and how some investment bankers corral him into a highly risky, yet immensely lucrative MBO.  The story unfolds with great suspense (and wit) as the process of the MBO occurs.  The writers have taken arcane financial terms and made them easy for any reader to understand so an MBO (management buy-out) is not understood only by an MBA.<br />But much more powerfully, the writers have given the characters great depth as the reader really can envision who these players are.  When Kravis is sitting at the table, the writers clearly describe who has the power and who doesn't.  You get the sense that you are right in the middle of the action.  Barbarians at the Gate is an entertaining and informative tale about Corporate America.<br />You will not be disappointed with this read.
B000002L71|4.0|This is a great disc even if you are not a huge Talking Heads fan.  It's fun to listen to and is full of the quirky lyrics that made the band and front-man David Byrne famous.  Don't let the \\"big suit\\" on the cover concern you...this disc is definitely a good fit!<br />NOTE:  The original verson is good, but you may want to look for the remastered version with a revised track order and bonus songs.
0060931736|3.0|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is a very interesting book.  There are many different themes and moods.  And you never really know what to expect.  The setting is mostly within the school that in which Miss. Brodie is a teacher but in the least sense of the meaning.  Miss. Brodie is in her \\"prime\\" and doesn't really teach what she's is supposed to but what she wants too and what she feels is \\"important\\".  <BR> Miss. Brodie picks six students and they quickly become her favorites and are know to everyone as \\"The Brodie set\\"  Miss. Brodie seems to live her life through these six girls.  She teaches them lessons about art, love, and how to be a proper woman.  Not only does she teach the girls about all of this but she tends to demonstrate it as well.  She encourages the girls to become sexually active and tells them of all the stories of the love of her life and how she would not do it, but always hinting that she had.  She would take them to plays and tell them about the greatest writers and poets, but it would always have to do with how polite they were, never really with the artists themselves. <BR> Miss. Brodie is a very unique women and doesn't care what others think.  She knows that the head mistress of the school despises her and is willing o do anything to get rid of her but she needs some ones help.  The book goes through the lives of the girls from when they were younger and in their \\"prime\\" until they are older and no longer associate with Miss. Brodie.  The big plot of the story however is that Miss. Brodie gets fired and it is because of someone in her precious Brodie set.  <BR> The book provides you with lessons of individuality, group identity, loyalty, rebellions, love, and relationships.  A good book for anyone to read.
B00006AW2F|5.0|Though the Stones didn't want this particular compilation released, I for one am glad it came out as it did.<br />Like the Bob Dylan bootleg series, the alternative versions of these Stone's songs are real gems.

B00006RIO7|5.0|The movie is one of the biggest success of this year's new movies. It has been proven by the Golden Globes that the movie has gotten! THe soundtrack is just as brilliant as the film! Hearing the actors singing, hearing that some of them can sing better than a lot of singers nowdays. The music business is finally refreshed with something new. THe music business which has too many not-worth-to-mention pieces! And all of the songs of the soundtrack is brilliant, starting with Anastacia's Love Is A Crime or just thinking of Macy Gray's amazing voice. So don't let Elisabeth Vincentelli stop you with giving you bad prejudices with reviewing talents with words such as 'blagh'!
0790729628|5.0|One has to remember this was done in the early 1980's when watching this film.  Replicants aren't too far off from reality these days, nor is the blending of cultures and languages portrayed in a Los Angeles of the future.<br />Like an old Bogart movie, Harrison Ford is out to get his man (replicant) and makes some self-discoveries along the way.<br />The sets, acting, and story line all meld to make this an outstanding film.  Based on a compelling novel.
0786868694|5.0|I got this as a Christmas present, and was happy to get it, but more for browsing through than actually cooking. But as I really read the recipes, I decided I had to try them because they really looked fun. Nigella takes all the pressure off, with a sort of attitude that she's just a really good friend who can cook, not an imposing, almighty, Julia Child type. Anyway, fun to make stuff so far has been the Ham in Coca-Cola, the creammy scalloped potatos,the mozzarella in carrozza, chocolate fudge cake, and the South beach black bean soup, which is excellent. My only flop was the salmon fish cakes, which grossed me out because I'm not used to canned salmon, so that's my fault, not Nigella's. This is a colorful, pretty cookbook, and so unique. I highly recommend it.
0792839749|4.0|I know this movie is amazingly corny. But I remember loving it as a kid when I saw it at the Cinerama theater in Santurce and enjoyed seeing it again on DVD. I guess kids today wouldn't like it too much and would find it boring, but if you liked it as a child go ahead and buy it.<BR>The complaints about pan and scan are valid, but MGM did a great job on the transfer. This movie has never looked better. And they kept the Intermission that occurs just when the car is going to crash into the sea. I remember that Intermission pause really  made an impact on me as a kid and it was great to see it  on the DVD!

0060523794|1.0|For those of us who survived King Louis XVI's entire reign as IBM CEO, the image of our unbeloved monarch as some sort of brilliant savior is painfully laughable.  It's true that Gerstner instituted a few much-needed reforms during his first couple of years: do-nothing employees (\\"retired on the job\\") could no longer coast their way along.  The number of habitual slackers was small, however, and they were pushed out the door quickly.  Those of us who remained were promised great things for our hard work and loyalty.<br />So what we did we get as our reward?  In 1999, in the midst of a booming stock market when IBM was rolling in money, Gerstner gutted our pension plan.  His forcible conversion to a cash-balance plan would have cost many older employees half of their pensions.  Luckily, the uproar was so great that Big Lou soon relented and magnanimously allowed employees over 40 to keep what they had been promised for decades.  Those under 40 were out of luck: by most estimates, they lost \\"only\\" a quarter to a third of their pensions.  A previously unthinkable IBM employees' union was formed in response to this atrocity.<br />(Gerstner does not even bother to discuss the pension issue in his book.  On July 31, 2003, a federal judge ruled that IBM's alterations to its pension plan illegally discriminated against older workers.)<br />More back-stabbing was to follow.  Retired employees who were promised free medical coverage for life are now required to pay a big chunk of their pension for health insurance -- and this in the face of only one tiny cost-of-living adjustment in a decade.<br />It was around the time of the pension massacre that the last vestiges of trust and open communication between employees and executives disappeared.  \\"Respect for the individual\\" had been replaced by \\"Respect for the size of Lou's bank account.\\"  The annual opinion survey was gone -- in pre-Gerstner days, it had been taken quite seriously -- and open discussion of difficulties and complaints had all but evaporated.  As late as 1997, we received a candid memo from our division president apologizing for the horrendous problems associated with Lotus Notes (another of Lou's unadmitted disasters).  By the end of the 1990s, the best we could expect were bland management-speak memos whose content was about as perceptive and inspiring as Marie Antoinette's comments on peasants.<br />Instead of candor and respect, we were offered Gerstneresque pearls such as the worthless \\"Win - Execute - Team\\" garbage that even our line management found hard to discuss without laughter.  (\\"What's the latest name for our annual list of accomplishments?  Personal Business Commitments?  No, that was last year.  Oh right, now it's called WET.  Whatever.\\"  Muffled guffaws.)<br />In short, Louis V. Gerstner's \\"turnaround\\" changed IBM from one of the best companies on the planet into Animal Farm.<br />\\"All animals are equal but ... oh, why bother.  Just hand over any remaining benefits we forgot to take away.\\"mplaints had all but evaporated.

B00005JKES|3.0|Twin Peaks may be great, and I'm glad to have it available on DVD, but I think it's really deceitful to market this as \\"the complete first season.\\" That's really a lot of bull, and they have you over a barrel once you've purchased it. Why... wouldn't they include the pilot in this set (rights or no rights)? I had looked forward to introducing my friend to this great series last night only to have the evening ruined because the so-called first episode already had a two-hour jump on the narrative. That is ridiculous and I resent having to buy another dvd to get the pilot. Harrumph!
B000084T18|5.0|The album lives up to the hype.  This album is off the chains!!!!  His underground work is better, but you gotta know that working on the mainstream is different, but that still didn't change the fire that he brought to the unknown ear.  He starts off the heat with \\"What Up Gangsta\\", then \\"Many Men\\" gets hot.  Then obviously there's \\"In Da Club\\".  \\"Heat\\" is off the block.  His rip on Murder Inc. on \\"Back Down\\" is hot, but \\"P.I.M.P.\\" has got to be my favorite.  There are some holes in this album, but you gotta be a fool if you're not gonna cop this album.  As the late Jam Master Jay said \\"50 Cent is the truth!!!!\\"
B0000067L2|5.0|If &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; introduced the trio as a bristling exercise in yanking the blues to the future, &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; showed what Cream could do in terms of melding their blues sensibilities to some solid pop craftsmanship that made room for experimentation enough. They didn't abandon the blues (and never really would); the stirring &quot;Strange Brew,&quot; the thrusting &quot;Sunshine of Your Love,&quot; the jabbingly liquid cover of Blind Joe Reynolds' &quot;Outside Woman Blues,&quot; and the breezy &quot;Take It Back&quot; made that much clear. But now there's a loping, compact pair of psychedelic mini-masterworks (&quot;World of Pain,&quot; with Eric Clapton's neat dub of tandem guitar lines; and, of course, &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses,&quot; with that sloping splash of wah-wah guitar and Martin Sharp's suggestive lyric); a chiming &quot;Dance The Night Away,&quot; with its sweet falsetto harmonies, Clapton's pretty Byrds-meet-raga guitar overdubs, and the neatness of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker in the rhythm section; and, even, a little British music-hall lunacy (the hilarious &quot;Mother's Lament&quot;) to punctuate it. <br />For a band who earned a reputation for excess (a reputation not entirely justified), Cream is almost downright restrained here - even if &quot;SWLABR&quot; is pushing it a little bit (though the rippling between Clapton's quivery guitar and Baker's skins is worth it) and &quot;We're Going Wrong&quot; seems a little too anxious to burst its seams before Bruce and Clapton riff it neatly into the finish. The dynamic tension between that restraint and the natural burstings of the three musicians made &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; an album bound (you were sure of it when you heard it in its time) to outlive its time. And that, it did...plentifully.
B00006RIO7|4.0|This is a great soundtrack to a great movie!  However, the Queen Latifah, Lil' Kim, and Macy Gray remake of &quot;The cell block tango&quot; is really horrible.  Rap is very out of place on that soundtrack (and out of place in music, in my opinion).  If it weren't for that one song, this cd would be near perfect! Catherine Zeta-Jones does an excellent job on &quot;And All That Jazz&quot; especially.

6305922756|5.0|This really wasn't that funny, because all the jokes are old, and it's just plain silly. Did I like it, no not really, would I watch it again, yes, would I recommend it to you, yes. 1 star is a bad rating in my book, but so many others liked it, so if fact I can't say whether or not you like it. You may or may not, it's totally up to you, and I suggest you see it, because who knows, maybe you'll like it. I thought it was bad. Go ahead and see it and form your own oppinion. After all this is a movie that you honestly can't go and see based on others oppinions, because this may or may not entertain you. I didn't like, but see it anyway. JUST KIDDING, this movie rules, it's so funny. Believe me. It's a spoof documentary. A must See!
0613325419|5.0|I hate to give away some of the books more interesting points, but I LOVE the way this book is written to explain away muggle sightings of magical beasts such as the Loch Ness Monster, and other creatures featured in muggle \\"fairy stories\\" such as fairies, unicorns, trolls, etc.  It also explains how such creatures can really exist without our knowledge.  The Foreward by Dumbledore that mentions the \\"Thiefs Curse\\" on anyone reading the book who did not purchase it is also cute.  The notes by Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are amusing as well.<br />Another benefit for any reader of Harry Potter books is that it gives one a greater understanding of why creatures like the centaurs in the first book and the mermaids in the fourth book mostly want little to do with humans.  Of course this portrayal of the centaurs behavior is only in the book and not the movie, and therefore wouldn't be at all intriguing to someone who has only seen the movie, but only to a true addict like myself.  I can't wait till the 5th book is released - I WANT MORE!
6305903182|4.0|Scream 3 is easily the scariest, most suspensful, and most clever of all the Scream flicks. The first one [was bad], the 2nd one was better, but this is easily the best in the series. It just barely makes a 3.5. This third installment of the hugely popular Scream trilogy doesn't have the moxie and smarts of its two predecessors, but it's still a great thrill ride. The Scream Trilogy has to be one of the most influential trilogies since Star Wars and the Godfather. The first Scream, it was easy to figure out the killers, in Scream 2 they made it harder, but I didn't guess right in Scream 3 though. So anyway, these aren't really that scary, but Scream 3 does have effectively scary parts. As I said, the slashers that came before it are FAR superior to these, but for some laughs and a couple of cheap thrills, you should buy this along with Scream & Scream 2. Watch them alone in the dark.
B000084T18|5.0|This album was everything that I anticipated. Ive been a huge fan of 50 since '99'. 50 commands your attention when he spits. There is nothin better than listen to something that u know is real. This is the way hip hop is supposed to be. There isnt one song on here that u can fast foward and thats very impressive. when I listen to it, I start from the first song and play it all the way through. Only one other album that gets that attention from me right now is Nas's \\"God Son\\". Im also lovin that DVD that came with the album. Overall, I gave the album a 4.5 cause he shoulda had another artist featured. I would have loved to hear Devin tha Dude and Snoop Dogg on that \\"21 Questions\\". That woulda made it a 5. JSTEED. IM OUT.........................<br />\\"if David can go at Goliath with a stone, I can go at Nas and Jigga both for throne\\"
B0000640VO|5.0|This is the best film I saw in 2001!  I left the theater with elation and joy in my heart and a grin on my face.

B00000JFV9|5.0|The Original Old Jack City soundtrack before there was a New Jack! They don't even make sndtrcks like this and SHAFT anymore.  All African American film sndtrcks today are vocal and usually aren't related to events or help tell the story of the movie, just could be on any artists regular LP. The only two that has come close in the new era is probably New Jack City which resurrected the sndtrcks and Boyz in the Hood. Put Superfly in your CD or cassette player and drive around the hood and tell me you don't feel part of the story or better yet, create and imagine your own story from Curtis's music alone.  That's powerful.  Ride around listening to Little child runnin wild and tell me you see &amp; feel the images around you come to life.  You imagine you're in your own movie, not just Superfly but any one of several scenarios. I could write an entire different movie alone and put Curtis's sndtrck to it and it would be a hit.  I've already imagined it.  That's how ingenious and compelling this man's music is. And it's all original, no drum machines, synthesizers, computers, it's note for note his! It touches the very essence of who we are.  It &amp; Shaft are the two best pound for pound! Check my SHaft review!
B00000IQC8|5.0|alright, clerks isnot the best movie ever, but its one of the best modern comedies, but a good movie does not necesarily make a good dvd.  However, the director comentary on this dvd is amazing.  it makes the clerks special edition dvd a must own for all smith fansb
B00005JL3A|4.0|I was a bit worried this movie would be nothing but another bland horror attempt, but thankfully Resident Evil is far more. It has the visual effects, the soundtrack, and the acting to really shine. The story is complex enough to keep you guessing, but simple enough to let the action flow. Resident Evil is the truly first good horror movie in quite some time.<br />The visual effects of RE are quite unique. A beautiful mix of all CG scenes with live action really puts that video game fill into it. The often overlooked fact is that as a RE gamer, you usually have at least in part a lot of info on the world around you. You know things you couldn't otherwise know. For example, how things work, maps, where things are, etc. This movie does a great job of keeping the viewer informed in this manner, without going so far as to ruin the surprises. As for the undead, this movie is unmatched. The way they move, moan, and even die is exactly what any RE fan will expect. It's really good to see the attention to detail.<br />The soundtrack is every bit as cool. In the theater it sounded incredible, and it certainly doesn't disappoint at home. For all of those out there watching on some crud two speakers system... you'll miss out. The movie just doesn't have the same punch without the deep bass and creepy ambient surround sounds around you. For all of those with the system to handle it, you'll have a new showcase title for your DVD collection.<br />As for the acting, the downfall of so many movies, it's simply outstanding. You really do feel as if you're watching an elite squad of jaded specialists. It's somewhat like Starship Troopers, in a different setting. I really felt convinced of the performances. When they're hurt, they act hurt. When they're scared, they're scared. There's very little room for uncertainty here. If they actors aren't upset about being injured, or scared of the death that surrounds them, then it's quite hard for the audience to be concerned either.<br />Resident Evil manages to not only get the job done, but to excel. It should pass all expectations you may have for it, and surprise you a few times as well. It certainly ranks among my favorites as an action / horror flick. I honestly believe it would even if it didn't have the game series behind it.<br />- Rirath_com
0345409671|3.0|This book is a theory.  As the Bible is a theory, the Torah, the Koran.  Albeit much more interesting and not so hypocrytical, that is all it is and I think that what Anne Rice did with this book is put all her own theories into a story and instead of being rudiculed for writing a Religion book (a book that would actually be in the religious section of the bookstore) she decided to throw Lestat in there and pass it off as fiction.<br />The non-theory part of the book (also the parts that actually concern Lestat, which is only about 1/4 at most of the book) is pretty good.  There seems to be a long work-up in the begining and after 300 pages of dialog and only a few paragraphs of action, it seems like Rice rushed the ending and decided to throw in one minor tragedy which could be summerized in her own words as, \\"Armand, Armand.\\"<br />So if you want to read a book and hear a new theory on God and the Devil (at it really is not a bad theory, mind you.  As a matter of fact, it is the best I have ever really heard with the exception, of course, of \\"There is no God\\") then go ahead and read this book.  If you are looking for an important piece to the Vampire Chronicles, then skip this book.
0451457994|4.0|This book had me entertained from start to finish. I have to admit I skimmed over the long descriptions of planets, and how the space flights worked, simply because it seemed so very outdated now. Most of the descriptions though, especially later in the book, were ideal. They portrayed the scene perfectly. You really feel like you can picture exactly what the book is describing.<br />The book isn't nearly as dull and drawn out as the movie. While it does have a few slow moments, it manages to switch around enough so it doesn't start to bore you on one detail. There are just so many plot twists, and the book covers such a grand scale, I found I never became bored. I found the book to be many times better than the movie. Much more detail is given, and the story although mysterious, actually makes sense. A deeply interesting story and great Sci-fi elements make this an all round great book.<br />- Rirath.com
B00003CXDG|1.0|Tom Cruise did here the same that Drew Barrymore did with CHARLIE´S ANGELS: he simply destroyed the original TV series concept (modestly preserved in the first movie), and change the main character (EThan Hunt) into RAMBO, more than a superman, and virtually banned all the other characters from the screenplay!! IT´s just a vehicle for Cruise´s ego, nothing more than that!<br />Also, it has one of the worst villains ever, and there exists a total lack of chemistry between Cruise and the thief lady.<br />About Woo´s direction, the same as always: heartless, mechanic, violent without purpose, a total waste. Go back to Hong Kong, man.

B00006F83Y|5.0|I bought this on the strength of \\"No One Knows\\" which has driven me up the wall humming it and threatened to ruin various long friendships as a result. I was quite unprepared for what I heard and played the whole thing through three times as soon as I got it in the car (it was a long journey).<br />The title track \\"A Song For The Deaf\\" is one of the best songs I've ever heard and the spoof girl DJ's introduction to it sends shivers up my back. Other stand-outs are \\"First It Giveth\\", \\"Go With The Flow\\", \\"A Song For The Dead\\" and \\"Millionaire\\". One hysterical (one minute) moment is \\"Six Shooter\\" which is how I'd like to behave in front of my customers once in a while.<br />Finally, Dave Grohl needs cloning. He's far too good at everything to live long at this rate.<br />\\"..the sweatest grease, the finest meat...\\". Songs For The Deaf is the dogs.

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zep's first 6 albums are absolutely essential.  Of course all their albums are good, the first six are just especially great.  I've listened to this album along with all of Zep's albums over and over again, and they never grow old.<br />1. Black Dog - Perfect opener, an odd timing that frustrated John Bonham, this is a great riff written by John Paul Jones and the song features incredible Plant vocals and great Page riffing.  A Zeppelin radio staple. 10/10<br />2.  Rock and Roll - Another well known Zeppelin classic.  It starts out with Bonham doing a Little Richard beat, and it's a straight ahead rocker.  Pure energy, and again every member of the band putting forth their top effort.  10/10<br />3. Battle of Evermore - Great song featuring Page playing a mandolin, it sounds like a Tolkien-esque war song.  Like Immigrant Song's acoustic cousin.  Very mystical, very atmospheric.  10/10<br />4. Stairway to Heaven - easily Zep's best known song, and the most played song on the radio.  There is nothing more I can say about Stairway that hasn't already been said. 10/10<br />5. Misty Mountain Hop - another rocker.  Good riffs, great vocals by plant, powerful Bonham drumming, pure zeppelin. 10/10<br />6. Four Sticks - one of the most difficult songs for Led Zep to record, mainly because of Bonham using four drum sticks to play the song (hence the title). Great powerful riffs, shows off plant's vocal range, and JPJ reinforcing the heavy, rolling riff. 10/10<br />7. Going to California - Another radio staple, this acoustic, piece gives Plant room to stretch out his voice.  A classic 10/10<br />8. When The Levee Breaks - A great, if underrated Led Zep song.  This blues number features Page playing heavy slide guitar, Plant wailing away on the harp, and Jonesy laying down some thinck heavy bass.  The centerpiece of this song is Bonham's impossibly heavy drumming which was created by putting his drum set in a stairwell.  Tremendous closer 10/10<br />This album is flawless,it's hard for me to pick a favorite Zeppelin album cause I like them all so much, it's like picking a favorite kid.  But this one's definitely up there, and a strong case can be made for this as zep's best.
B00005JL96|3.0|Ya know, it's sad when a fun family film like this can be bogged down by worthless PC garbage. I never saw this movie in the theater, I almost didn't even rent it. Why? Because every review or shred of information I read pointed to the character designs. Junk like &quot;It's so wonderful to see an empowered female character who doesn't fit the barbie cookie-cutter design.&quot; and utter non-sense like that. I figured, judging from what I'd heard, it was nothing but Disney PC garbage. I should have trusted Disney's sense more than that.<br />Look folks, it's simple. Lilo is slightly overweight and so are a few other characters in the movie. Other characters are very fit and lean. There's a wide mix and this is NOTHING new. This is NOT some kind of PC garbage, this is not woman empowerment, and this has NOTHING to do with the movie. It doesn't make them look &quot;real&quot;, it doesn't change a freaking thing from any other movie. It's just one tiny little aspect that these lifeless morons decided they wanted make center stage. The characters and locations are wonderfully drawn and animated, and each have their own style.<br />This of course leads to senseless bashing of all the Disney women of the past. How low can people stoop. I've heard so much garbage now about how Ariel, Jasmine, and the rest are such awful role models for girls. Get a freakin life. Ariel is a MERMAID for crying out loud, and Jasmine's a princess. How can you think that the active, healthy women of Disney films would not LOOK healthy! It's mind numbing.<br />But, enough of that. Less than 15 minutes into the movie you'll realize this has all been blown so far out of proportion it's not funny, and forget all about it. Disney has put together a movie that's funny, action packed, and filled with great characters. Lilo is a bit of a brat, which is just plain hilarious. It's the only way a relationship between her and Stitch would be even slightly believable. Her older sister Nani is a little pointless, but fills the role none the less. Cobra Bubbles is a stretch to believe, but hey... why not. He's entertaining, and his voice booms loudly over the sub-woofer. It's just fun to hear him talk.<br />It's far from one of Disney's best, and it's largely forgettable. But hey, it's worth a rental and it's got some good laughs. You'll be hard pressed not to love Stitch no matter what you think of the movie. It's worth renting just to see him alone, but the movie itself should keep you entertained as well. It's not a classic, but it is fun hour and a half... and that's all I expected.<br />- Rirath_com
B0000256KE|5.0|From model Amanda Lear looking pre-S&amp;M on the cover, to the insane outfits of the band in the booklet, it was already obvious by the second Roxy album that this is a different kind of glam. Besides crediting their hair stylists and designers, Roxy Music were apparently a band pushing style as well as substance. Equally, in fact. <BR>&quot;Do the Strand&quot; is a favorite, as it and &quot;Editions of You&quot; are the only real songs you could imagine hearing on the radio. Yet &quot;Beauty Queen&quot; is a ballad in classic Ferry tradition: &quot;ooh the way you look/makes my starry eyes shiver&quot;. Bryan's almost-vampirish vibrato twisting about every phrase is something it takes time to get used to. If you have a sense of humor, it shouldn't take too long. <BR>The masterpiece of the album however, is the one everyone has to mention. &quot;In Every Dreamhome a Heartache&quot; could probably beat out a Bowie glam tune out of sheer decadance and eerieness. &quot;I blew up your body...but you blew my mind&quot; is just one example of the essential couplets in this vaguely-psychedelic blowout. <BR>&quot;The Bogus Man&quot; may be one of the strangest tunes, but definitely amazing. The lyrics may only last 4 minutes, but odd droning of the synths (courtesy of Eno), guitar from Phil, and heavy breathing gasps from Ferry for the next 5 minutes is pure 70s bliss. <BR>The rest of the tunes, I suppose, are a bit difficult to describe. That's for you to find out.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|There is not much that can be written about this movie, for words cannot express the quality of this film.  This is the only time a movie has made me both happy and depressed based upon its terrific acting.  I believe this movie is more realistic than &quot;fantasy&quot;, as it brings out emotions that films never do.  All I know is, it made me think long and hard, not necessaril about the plot, rather about the movie itself and its grabbing nature...This movie deserves 5 stars solely for that reason.
B00005JL78|3.0|Minority Report fails on many levels, but succeeds enough to be worth watching. Having seen it twice now, once in the theater and once on DVD, I'm pretty sure I didn't miss any of the story along the way. Even so, there's so much unexplained happenings it's absurd. I'm not the type who has to have a explanation for everything, but there's so many wild leaps and bounds in this movie it's simply outrageous at times. I'm all for sci-fi universes having their own set of rules, but Minority Report just leaves me scratching my head.<br />The whole powerball wannabe crime detection system makes so little sense it's scary. In the age of incredible technology, wooden balls are used? What? And why does everyone throw out their TV sets, and project faded blurry images against walls? Why would newspapers and cereal boxes have moving up to date data? There's no way this could be practical cost wise. Why on Earth would cops use \\"stick sticks\\" that makes the perpetrator throw up?! Why do the police run around like keystone cops trying to take the perps down using only said sick sticks and various other close combat techniques? Does the future have no sniper weapons? And why does Anderton Jr. run like he's one neuron short of a synapse? Okay, I'm just being mean now... but it's still true.<br />I'm just getting started... why on Earth do I want to see a closeup of fake mucus oozing from someone's nose for absolutely no reason at all. The ending, which I won't spoil, is completely unsatisfying and actually ends up just leaving me wondering if they couldn't come up with anything better. It's like they just gave up on the story and defaulted to the simplest answer they could find. So many scenes make absolutely no sense and was put in for reasons I can't understand. An old woman smoking a pipe laughing... for no reason what so ever, having nothing at all to do with the story. A kid, alone and bored, going around on a merry-go-round. Why? It's like some kinda surreal experiment gone very wrong. And these clear computers... give me a break. There's no way they could be useful to the users, and would never survive.<br />All that being said though, despite some big time flaws it's still a decent movie and it's worth watching at least once. The ending's a let down, half the story is unnecessary, and there's even two or three complete gross out scenes for no reason at all. Still, it manages to have it's moments, and the effects are pretty good.<br />- Rirath_com
B000002J09|5.0|To put it in analogy...Stairway is to IV as IV is to Zeppelin. This is your definitive source for early Zeppelin, as in non-selftitled albums :) Don't overlook other stuff like Physical Graffiti, LZ III, etc, but when you say Led Zeppelin, this is what people think of.
B00000099Y|5.0|I must admit that it's pretty easy to dismiss Tool as another angsty teen nonsense-metal band based on their fan base alone. I avoided this band for years because of the kind of people I saw wearing their T-shirts: The same gothy teenagers who worship Marilyn Manson. I finally decided to check out Tool after a friend whose musical opinion I trust suggested them to me, and bought \\"Lateralus\\" and \\"AEnema.\\"<br />Let me just say that if you listen to music deeply at all, this album will probably be an acquired taste. Despite it's traditional instrumentation, the album challenges the bounds we've set for what music \\"should\\" sound like, and what structure it's \\"supposed\\" to follow. At first listen, it will probably strike you as being \\"just noise\\". There's a method to their madness, however, and with an open mind and repeated listens, you can start to get inside of the music and appreciate it.<br />\\"Aenema\\" is very rhythm-driven. The guitar, bass, and drums all contribute to the percussive feel of the music, creating an overall \\"tribal\\" sort of vibe to much of the songs. This is most apparent in the song intros (especially Eulogy), routed heavily in the Indian rhythms that drummer Danny Carrey studies.<br />Another unique aspect of the music is the way in which sections are dragged out while managing not to sound monotonous. We're often teased by a \\"rock out\\" chorus that always feels JUST out of reach, building more and more tension until the band finally kicks into the chorus. This way of building energy is used throughout the album, particularly on \\"Hooker With a ...\\" after the second chorus. Through the wall of sound, a rhythmic figure in 5/16 emerges and builds in intensity until the whole band (vocalist included) is playing the rhythm over a flurry of tom notes created by Danny Carrey. Tension builds as the listener knows they're on the edge of something, when suddenly it stops, Maynard whisper/sings \\"Shut up and-\\", a drum fill leads into \\"BUY!!\\" and the band explodes. It's kept just out of reach for nearly a minute, and when it happens, the effect is VERY powerful. And unlike a lot of other \\"powerful\\" moments on other CD's, it never gets old. This music is still just as intense for me as it was several months ago.<br />I've only touched on what makes this album great, and encourage people to discover the rest for themselves. The key to enjoying \\"Aenema\\" (and \\"Lateralus\\") is to approach it with an open mind. Give it as many chances as it takes to appreciate what the musicans are trying to do on this album. Your efforts will be well worth it.
B000084T18|5.0|It's almost as if 50 cent didn't want to give us too much on his first effort. The slowly paced album doesnt jump right in to deep to quick. Its almost as if hes saying heres a taste of what i can do, but you just wait till i drop my next album. However, what an album this is. Not that 50 cent can lose, he has aligned himself with two of the biggest names in rap right now, Dr. Dre, and Eminem and theres no looking back. His calm raps, laid back style, and gangsta lyrics would appeal to any fan of rap music. There is only one weak track, 21 questions with Nate Dogg seems weak, not his exact style..by far the best tracks are in da club, dont push me (feat eminem) and paitently waiting (feat eminem) also p.i.m.p, and what up gangsta are solid hits, this whole cd is great, theres only one song to skip the others are ALL tight tracks. YOu may think, oh sure he needs Eminem in his tracks to be good, but thats not true. Cent raps with eminem in two songs and the two complement eachother so well they should think about making a whole cd for real! And the tracks that are just 50 Cent, are also super tracks, overall, this is a rare thing, a rap cd with no stupid skits, (the only skit actually turns into a song), and all 18/19 tracks are solid. GREAT buy, pick this one up if you like rap, period. FIVE STARS.
B0000636UN|4.0|It is easy to be a Sheryl Crow fan.  Her talents as a musician and singer are rare.  Rarer still is her songwriting ability.  Combining all three ensures her a place (yet to come) in the Rock-N-Roll hall of fame.  This album reflects her maturing musical taste.  It does seem to revisit previously used musical themes but is by no means repetative.  All in all, great to listen to anytime.
B00005YW4H|5.0|A true and pure vocalist like Norah Jones only comes around once in each decade. In the 70's it was Karen Carpenter, the 80's Whitney Houston. Norah is this decades great new vocalist. <BR>She has a natural voice which puts her amongst the classics. She sings in rich full bodied tones with a soulful quality which cuts right to the center of your emotions. Her voice is instantly recognizeable with a certain grace and class which is usually possessed by a seasoned vocalist of many years. Though Norah at the young at of 22 has these qualities. <BR>Her music is smooth with a sense of mystery and tranquil soul.<BR>If this album is any indication, Norah has quite a bright and hopeful future ahead of her.
0806930152|3.0|You MUST have an in-depth knowledge of the human anatomy (particularly the bones and muscles) before you buy this book.  I bought this book on the account of the previous reviewers who I assume (just now, unfortunately) are professionals or fine-arts students.  Most of the analysis refers to scientific names of bones and muscles. I understand this is a good thing BUT most of the time, there are either (1) no visual references to these bones and muscles on the page where the analysis is made (i.e. sometimes you have to move forward a few pages to determine what is being discussed) or worst, (2) there are no visual references at all.  I don't blame the author considering this book is a compilation of his individual works which may have been complete unto themselves.  I blame the publisher for not taking the time and effort to add value to the book by labeling the visuals themselves (perhaps by asking Mr. Bridgman's former students to do it for them) and for making sure the pages are in the correct order.  I get the feeling this book was hurried out of the press.<br />I have downloaded Mr. Loomis book \\"Figure Drawing for All It's Worth\\" and if you're a beginner like me, it's a better deal (heck, it's free) because the text are clearer and the visuals cleaner.  Please consider my rating a beginner's gauge rather than a professional's or a fine-arts student's. <br />I'll just probably use this book as a visual reference rather than a self-study guide...
B00004R99R|2.0|I like most Disney movies but I hated this one.  I love Greek mythology and they ruined it.  I can sort of understand some of the changes because this is a movie for kids.  However, some of the changes were just stupid.  That part were Phil is talking about the other greek heros is horrible.  None of them failed and Perseus is a constellation.  I did like some of the songs.  Disney should have done another myth that would be better suited to be made into a movie for kids.
B000084T18|5.0|CLASSIC!  Congratulations 50 Cent, Dre, and Em on putting together one of the tighest rap albums ever.  In my opinion, this album can be put right at the top with Illmatic, The Chronic, Doggystyle, and Reasonable Doubt classics.  Every true rap fan needs to buy this album, you won't be able to stop listening to it.  Ghost.
B000084T18|5.0|Remember back in the day say around 96' when you were bumpin' your head to Biggie and Pac and feeling every last word uttered from these hip hop geniuses? You will get that same feeling listening to \\"Get Rich or Die Trying.  50 Cent has captured true street grime, and let it loose on his debut. DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!  It is an instant classic! And if you are a true hip hop head then this is the silly and soft rap and R&B duets...YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!A real rap record....It's about time.
B000084T18|5.0|This cd lives up to the hype.  It is right up there with the greatest of all time.  50 has a great future ahead and i dont think we have even heard the best yet.
B00006690G|5.0|ok, for a start, i don't usually listen to hip-hop, i'm into metal, basically because its a damm lot better than any other sort of music there is around. but i heard this at a mates house, and well what can i say its an amazing album! ive bought it now and played it to death, eminem rocks! what puts him above other rappers that he actually SAYS something that means something, and just like the best metal out there, its full of passion and the care and dedication he put into the songs is evident. damm good.

B00005RYLE|5.0|Well once again Evil Dead has been re-released on dvd but this time the packaging tops all the previous released versions. The book that comes with the dvd is a great little history on how the years have been unkind to Evil Dead on video. Like Night Of The Living Dead, Evil Dead has seen tons of different video, laserdisc and dvd releases, and i'm sure this won't be the last DVD version either, which is good for the collector but bad for the wallet. Evil Dead today is one of the most respected horror films ever. It's amazing to think that this was a low budget film and it proves that you don't need a huge budget to pull off a good horror film. Night Of The Living Dead was the same way, low budgeted and a classic (Romero should stick to his roots with the next Dead movie and not go big budget like he's trying to do). Bottom line...Evil Dead is a classic horror film. It's full of humor, gore, cheesy special effects...everything a good horror film should have. They definetly don't make them like they use to and it's a shame for horror films everywhere!
B0000065O1|5.0|This is a great cardio workout.  You will feel the results for at least the day after.  All the workouts are very good except the chest exercises, not enough of them.  All in all a very good tape.
B000002AGN|5.0|Here is an album which broke new molds in the jazz idiom; exploring complex melodic improvisations with odd time signatures, recorded beautifully with lots of space and open live feeling. <br />Now since music is music and I would never expect everyone to like the same things, I cannot guarantee that you will enjoy this album as much as I do. <br />However, I can guarantee that some people who make reviews on this website are total morons and their opinions aren't worth the text that shows up on your monitor. Case in point, Aaron's review.<br />To sit there and tell people that a classic work which has obvously stood teh test of time, made by musicians that have been highly respected as true greats in their field is no good shows a lack of understanding about how music is created. <br />There are facts in this world and there are opinions. Opinions measure the amount of enjoyment music brings us. Opinions are personal and need not be supported.<br />However, there are facts too. Facts such as a player's skill on their instrument. Skills can be measured in definate ways. One can tell when a skilled player is at their instrument, regardless of whether we enjoy what they are playing. That is my indictment of this person's inconsiderate review. To say that these musicians are bad musicians is completely irresponsible journalism. These musicians are fabulously skilled on their instruments; dead on with their timing and displaying flawless control over their creative intentions. <br />Just because you don't personally respond to a sound does not give you the right to say that someone's musicianship is lacking. That is what is wrong with criticism; too much of it is our own stupid opinion and not enough evaluation on the actual work and its artistic integrity matched to it skillful execution. <br />Just because you don't prefer to listen to something, don't ruin it by telling others not to like it either. Am I supposed to feel like some sort of a musical idiot now just because you insist that this album is so bad and that I have been enjoying it so much? I guess that means anyone who likes this album doesn't know good music, and anyone who thinks that Joe Morello is an excellent drummer has no idea what drumming is?<br />I would love to see you play a drum solo in 5/4 time and make it so classic, so great, that people will still care to love it 40+ years later. I  happen to be a drummer, and I also happen to be friends with more than my share of other drummers. And guess what, they all agree that Joe Morello is one of the greatest that ever lived. You know who else said that on several occassions? Buddy Rich. But I guess you think he is also \\"terrifically bad.\\"<br />Another audacious and stupid comment you made regarded the color line in jazz. Arts, especially jazz are not here to seperate people, but instead, to bring them together. You must remember that jazz would not exist if not for white music  as much as it would for black music. If you knew anything at all about the history of this music, you would know damn well that it was born out of the mixture of Western music and the music of the slaves. Jazz is the sound of America not because it is black or white, but because it is everything. Jazz has grown from its beginnings to include the music of the Cajun peoples, the black slaves, the Irish immigrants, the Italians...even the music of Jewish people as Benny Goodman included Klezmer sounds in his repertoire. Take the classic \\"Sing, Sing, Sing\\" for example. Here is a song written by an Italian-American (Prima) adapted and arranged by a Jew, and performed in the Jazz idiom (Anglo-African) by a mixture of white, black, and jewish musicians. And yet here you are saying that Dave Brubeck ripped off a black art? Get a grip and read some books. Try to know what you are talking about before you shove off with your ignorant reviews. I find your comments disgusting and tasteless.<br />And just for your information, in this recording, that\\"terrifically bad\\" bass player is a black person. Again showing how much research you did before opening your mouth.<br />As my own critique of this disc, I would say that I highly enjoy it. I find the solos to be exciting and innovative, and the tunes are well written and well put together. <br />The only bad music there is in this whole world is music that is made by corporations for sale to large audiences with no integrity and no meaning. That is the only \\"bad\\" music in this whole world. The rest is all our own stupid opinions. It's very easy to sit back and critique other peoples' hard and long efforts and contribuations to the world of art. Very easy to sit there and tell others what is good and bad.<br />Very difficult to make something of your own.<br />I hope when you do, someone tells you how much you stink.<br />Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.
B0000683DH|5.0|[THIS CAN BE DEBATED, SO PLEASE VOTE POSITIVELY.]<br />After Gene Roddenberry's removal from the producer position because of the debacle regarding TMP, Paramount turned to television producer Harve Bennett, famed producer of nostalgia shows like \\"The Sixth Million Dollar Man\\" and \\"The Bionic Woman.\\"  Bennett obviously did his homework on what Star Trek was all about and even original writers Samuel A. Peeples and Judy Burns contributed to the script's execution.  But the man that would make this the best Star Trek film would ultimately play the role of unaccredited screenwriter and director: Nicholas Meyer.<br />For those of you who hated Shatner, I find his acting much better here.  In fact, there are no slackers in this cast at all.  But the actor to be most commended here is Ricardo Montalban (reprising his role as Khan from the TV episode \\"Space Seed\\"), who acts with angst and malevolence as he relentlessly pursues Admiral Kirk in pure Captain Ahab style.  The special effects are also good (some were lifted from TMP because of time constraints) and James Horner provides one of his best scores in his career.  Spock's death is also handled in an emotional fashion, as he Kirk must deal with his death even though the two cannot embrace because of the glass containment room keep them from doing so.<br />Nicholas Meyer told a story that is phenomenal in essence that it is several things at once: Shakesperian, Sci-Fi (obviously), a strong relation to the story Moby Dick, and submarine thriller (as the two ships battle each other in the Mutara Nebula).  All in all, a GREAT story.<br />Don't like Star Trek?  Watch this film.  It has many qualities that makes it seem different and yet a part of Roddenberry's legacy.  Get past the Trekkies and the hype of today's shows... WATCH this masterpiece.  It's a cinematic marvel.
0440237688|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  It not only provokes thoughts and ideas, it touches the people reading it.  Utopias are interesting subjects to read about.  Imagine a world without any pain, hardship, or public death.  However, there is also no love.  The main character, Jonas, realizes this as he receives memories.  I can't describe what some parts of this book make you feel.  I would recommend The Giver to anyone over the age of 12.
B000002513|5.0|&quot;Greetings from Asbury Park N.J.&quot; introduced Bruce Springsteen to the world. &quot;The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle&quot; introduced the world to &quot;The Boss!&quot;       This album captures all the best things that rock and roll should be and maybe . . ever will be. It is wild, innocent, and full of life at its most exciting time of discovery and the promise of new romance. The songs on this record exude youthful passion and joy in their purest, most musical and lyrical forms.       On his first album he rose like a savior from the dirty streets of that small-town carnival world known as Asbury Park along the Jersey Shore. With the release of &quot;The Wild, The Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle,&quot; Bruce Springsteen became the savior of rock and roll! -Peace-
B00005JLWN|5.0|Confession time. I never saw the Matrix. I am not a big fan of the genre.  I was merely intrigued that several fine actors such as Emily Watson, Christian Bale and Sean Bean were in a movie that was getting literally no promotion. So without really knowing what to expect,  I took a chance with $... bucks and two hours of my life.<br />I haven't had so much purely unexpected fun at a movie since a serious film buff friend dragged me to see a dubbed copy of one of John Woo's early  Hong Kong gangster epics starring the ever charismatic Chow Yun-Fat.  <br />Like those movies, Equilibrium took me on one heck of a visual and emotional roller coaster ride. <br />Was the plot derivative and full of holes?  Yes, but I did not care,  for my eyes were glued to the screen.  Kinetic direction and a set of charismatic actors caused Equilibrium to soar above its well worn plot lines. <br />Movies like this are for entertainment not great enlightenment.  I hope it finds an audience on DVD or as a feature movie on the Sci Fi channel.  It deserves far better marketing than the studio gave it.
0783241569|3.0|Any movie with Hugh Grant in it is half way decent, so I guess I have to say the same for the movie.  Grant plays his hopelessly in love character to the core, and Julia Roberts plays her role perfectly since she basically is who she plays.  There are some touching moments in the film, and a few funny ones as well, but it doesn't strike a chord.  Perhaps because the plot is too much like other romantic comedies, or maybe it's Grant's vulgar roommate &quot;Spike&quot;, who draws attention away from the story.  But if you like typical romantic comedies, then you might as well see this one too.
B000088E6M|3.0|It's a good album, but kind of disapointing. I was expecting more after &quot;Wanksta&quot; and &quot;In the Club&quot; came out. Oh well, it's still a good album. Best song: &quot;Blood Hound.&quot;
B00004YYWI|5.0|Come on this is Opeth, need i say more than 5 stars! The best band in the world, and if you dont like them????<BR>Keep on listening to your manufactured ____!
B00003CXC7|3.0|A bit slow at times, but classic Hitchock.<br />Summary:<BR>L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) is a photographer who broke his leg getting an exciting picture for his magazine.  As a result he has been stuck in his apartment for 7 weeks getting better and has one more to go.  He is dating Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) but he doesn't want to marry her and he doesn't want to change his life to adapt to what married life would be like.  <br />When Jeff believes his neighbor, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), killed his wife, Mrs. Anna Thorwald (Irene Winston), he begins an intrigue that sucks in Lisa and several others and only ends when Lars comes into Jeff's apartment and nearly kills him.  <br />My Comments:<BR>Either it is me aging or Hitchcock aging, but Hitchcock seems to get better the older I get.  The movie was fun to watch and the acting was pretty good.  Jeff's nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) was also a lot of fun, offering the wisdom of a wise woman's life in the time it takes to rub a man's back.  The set was brilliant (the entire story takes place in an a group of apartments).  And, perhaps best of all were the relationships that played out between the cast members.  There was love and loss and loneliness and rejection.  It was all there.<br />I never really felt any tension in the movie, but then again that could have been because there were moments when it was slow and I just didn't identify all that well with the characters.  But the film was very enjoyable nonetheless.  Great Hitchcock.  Also, the DVD special features were very informative and included interviews with most of the cast.
B00005JL96|1.0|Ok, I gave this movie 1 star only because there was no option for 0 stars.<br />At the beginning of this movie, after all the alien mumbo-jumbo, the movie starts with a beautiful scene of Lilo swimming in the ocean and then moves to an exquisite hula dancing scene.  Right then, I knew this was going to be one of my favorite movies.  But very suddenly that delusion was knocked out of me as Lilo beat up and bit another child.  The movie continues with unbelievable violence between Lilo and her sister.  There was a scene with Lilo, who locked herself in the house so her sister could not get in, laying on the floor listening to Elvis records saying she wanted to die.<br />I've worked with a lot with children and I know for a fact children will act out what they see in a movie or video.  In a lot of ways, what they see on a screen teaches them how to work out conflicts in their own lives.  What on earth does this teach them about how to act?  Biting and beating kids up because they reject you?  Gee, I can't wait for the sequel when Lilo goes to school and blows all her classmates to pieces ala Columbine.  And how many kids are now going to lay on the floor spouting to leave them alone, they want to die, just to get attention?  And no parent or adult sibling guardian has any right to beat a child into submission and make degrading comments (\\"I'd rather have a bunny\\") no matter what frustration they are feeling.  And then supposedly a nasty little alien comes down from the sky and makes this situation all better?  Somebody needs some therapy!!!  Oh, yeah, then there's this big assassin-like social worker who tries to take the child away.  Oh, but after aliens blow up the house and kidnap the girl, everything ends in your typical Disney happy ending.  Were the filmmakers on drugs???<br />This just further proves Michael Eisner is the worst thing to happen to Disney.  Thank God Jeffrey Katzenberg still makes great animated movies like SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMMARON -- notmy absolute favorite, but at least it had a good story that won't warp the minds of our little ones.<br />My experience of Hawaii is that children are highly prized, even having their own holiday, and that the village truly does raise each child there.  I remember there always being lots of grandparents, aunties and uncles, cousins, etc., to make children feel loved and to teach them honor.  Everyone in the community is Ohana, family.<br />Growing up in Hawaii, there was always so much magic, especially with all the legends and ghost stories.  And each culture that comes together to make up Hawaii, is so vibrant and interesting.  But these filmmakers chose to forgo all the beauty and magic of Hawaii and its history and culture, and had to juice up the movie with space aliens???<br />This film will not be in my collection.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I didn't even know the story of Chicago when I went to see the film a couple of days ago.  I was floored!  What amazing fantastic wonderfully talented actors!  One can often forget that to become an actor, one has to be multi-faceted in their talents to get those early and current roles!  Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere and John C. Reilly surprised me with their amazing singing and dancing!  Queen Latifa was wonderful, but I knew that from the movie &quot;Living Out Loud.&quot;  She's a hell of a singer and performer!  Listening to the soundtrack, all I have to do is close my eyes and I see the movie.  What a joy and delight!  This film and it's actors should sweep the Oscars this year!  To not, would be a travesty.
B000066NW0|4.0|Not your typical teeny bopper cd....I strayed from buying this because I thought this would be another bubble-gum pop cd, but it's definitely not. The cd has a little edge. A couple of songs show her age, but overall I am impressed with this cd.
0151008116|4.0|I very much liked this book for its initial character development and scene setting. The story was well told, although like a number of other people who reviewed this book, I thought some of the material in the last quarter of the book did not fit easily in with the rest of the material.  Still a highly entertaining and thought provoking work.
B0000636UN|2.0|I didn't really enjoy this cd at all. I ended up selling my cd. None of the songs were really that good...
1573229725|5.0|I came to this book when a friend handed it to me saying, \\"It's by the foremost lesbian novelist in the world.\\" Not exactly sure what to expect, based on that comment, I started reading. That characterization (which I've seen repeated in reviews) is unfair and does a great disservice to a wonderful novel, because it makes one believe that it promotes a viewpoint or that the story revolves around that narrow issue.<br />As to the story, it involves two orphans, a plot to deceive, arcane books, weird noblemen, machinations of all kinds, and in short, every gothic device imaginable. It has echoes of Dickens, Jane Eyre, and modern masters of the thriller. Don't let anyone tell you much about the plot ... I just envy you the experience of reading it.<br />It is very rare that I can find the time to finish a near 600 page book in under a week, but Fingersmith gave me little choice. It has wonderfully drawn characters, astounding plotting, and enough interesting elements to make you stay up way past when you want to. Go read it.
B00000JGHL|1.0|Would have given &quot;0&quot; stars on this one.  Boring and lacks any direction.
B000084T18|5.0|Get Rich Or Die Trying is A Ill Cd. Not Since Ready To Die (Notorious BIG) or Illmatic (Nas) has a debut cd had this much buzz. Of course 50 Cent's been blazing up mixtapes so the streets were dying to get this guy on a label and have him make a real cd. Eminem upping his street cred massivly with this move signed 50 Cent to shady aftermath and Get Rich Or Die Trying was made. The best song on the cd Patiently Waiting an Eminem produced track which also features em spitting a verse comes out with the Attitude 50 Cent is trying to bring to the rap game. In The Club the first single is a familar Dre track that brings good energy to the cd. P.I.M.P. is a funny song but on this cd full of classics is the weakest. Over all Get Rich Or Die Trying is one of the best CD's to come out since isnt this amazing 50 Cent's label mate Marshall Matthers so if you like hardcore hip hop or just love Aftermath/ Shady records go get this because although 50 Cent seems ready to die he's got a few more illmatic d's in him
B00006RU5B|5.0|There has been little hope of rock returning to the public lately, but fortunately, there is hope: Audioslave. With the Rage Against The Machine rapper gone, they picked up Chris Cornell, an *amazing* singer. This album kind blends Rage's style with that of Soundgarden, and the result is freaking awesome. It has been a long time since I heard a true rock album as good as this. To say the least, if you like Rage or Soundgarden, your going to love this album; and I'm confused as to why a lot of critics gave this album less then a perfect score. Nevertheless, if your sick of the mainstream MTV crap you hear these days, and you want rock back, well this album is the answer. Happy listening. <br />Best Songs: \\"Like a Stone\\", \\"Getaway Car\\", \\"Shadow of the Sun\\", \\"Cochise\\", \\"Set it Off\\" and \\"I am a Highway\\".
B000002H97|5.0|This album was one of the first albuns I bought. I bought it for \\"Sad But True\\", listened to all of the songs and instantly fell in love with the album. \\"Enter Sandman\\" was no doubt a great song, instant metal classic. If I were asked which song was the best one, that would be impossable to answer. All the songs were very good. \\"The Unforgivin\\" was like Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" in a way, it had an acoustic intro and just the rest was good. Defentily one of the best albums in the world.
B00006NSGX|5.0|I love this collection--I've listened to it many times over already! The combined talent on this CD set is incredible! Eric puts his matured voice to the test and gets an A+! the way he sings these songs and works that guitar---well, you just have to hear it. Very slight variations of pitch in voice (from the original cuts) in Tears in Heaven and Wonderful Tonight, make these versions better than what is normally played on the radio stations! And his rendition of Over the Rainbow is definitely worth the price of the CD alone!
B00005RY7X|3.0|I'm just glad this album didn't cause a new &quot;genre&quot; to spring up. Damn you MTV. Although you have to give credit to the guys in Andrew for actually writing their music, which is more than can be said for many of today's hot sellers, you can't exactly polish a Grammy for them. The riffs are fun, the lyrics are fun, the melodies are fun....maybe it's all a little too much fun. Another sour note on &quot;I Get Wet&quot; is the bothersome similarity between many of the songs' riffs. No one cares about the lyrical content being too shallow or similar....hey if the Kottonmouth Kings can make a career out of being potheads then surely there's no guilt in &quot;Partying till you Puke&quot;....right? Wrong....in the end this classical pianist and his large group of oddly dressed jamming buddies, while briefly entertaining, are probably a slap in the face to more legitimate acts who can't get signed. Plus, there's something that leaves me uneasy about rocking out to a band that sounds like GWAR on Ecstacy. Party metal? You can keep it.
B00005B36H|2.0|I dont know what the hype is.  So they can play in 7/8, whoopee.  Its basic radio rawk.  If you really want to to hear adventurous challenging heavy modern music pick up some Spiral Architect, Martyr's &quot;Warp Zone&quot;, or &quot;Led Circus&quot; by Simon Steensland!  The best part about this CD is the cover.
1558216847|3.0|I've read the book and think it makes a good story, but nothing<BR>more. There are things in this story that reveal it is purely fictional. First, there is no way you can walk 30 miles a day<BR>in at least three feet of snow in subzero temperatures. You have<BR>to have skis! Without skis, you can walk no more than 3 to 5 miles in those conditions. This is common knowledge to all us living in the same latitude and climate. As for making a hole in the ice in a Siberian river with ice thicknesses of over 3 feet. It is hard as steel and there is no way you can punch a hole in it using a block of wood! It is totally impossible. How about getting wet, wringing the wet clothes and putting them back on in subzero temperatures and howling wind? Gimme a break! You'll just freeze all over. And what about walking through the Gobi desert without a drop of water? I mean, given the high temperatures in that area, you can<BR>manage without water no more than 6 to 9 hours! And this guy tells us that they walked for days without so much as a drop of water! I would advise the publisher the check this guy out and change the heading from Autobiography/Adventure to Fiction. That is,if there really exists such a man as Rawicz, which I seriously doubt.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I rented this movie hoping to learn a bit more about the Navajo codetalkers that served in WWII.  I didn't learn anything about the program at all.  This movie is all about the fighting, and the acting during the fighting scenes stinks.  I usually enjoy Nicholas Cage's films, but this one is definitely his worst.  There is absolutely no character development and very little plot.  Save yourself the time and money, and skip this DVD.
0446310786|3.0|i think that this book is ok. its kind of confusing at some points i think you have to be a really good reader and smart to understand it.i think that the book has a good point and story, but some parts you just wont get. i would reccomend this book to people who like reading books about people's rights and older books about life. i think that the book could have been more exciting or they could have made it easer for people to read. they could have got rid of all the parts (suff) not important or needed. i would say that if you were to take a test on the book i think it wise to watch the movie to help you out. but all in all i think that this book was good but could have been better. but i do have a question why was this book banned??? when you read this book you will wounder why it was benned to, trust me. and if you know why it was banned then pelase post it so i can see why. thanks. read the book if you are up to the challange just joking read it if you want to read a good but challanging book. this is the one.
0316666343|1.0|By the time I got to the end of this book I was just flipping through the pages, skimming them for anything that seemed interesting. I had high hopes for this book, but I think, and I believe that any critical reader would agree, that there is no substance to this book.  I dogear pages in books that contain some jewel of language that I think pertains to my life or has some insight on human nature.  I didn't dogear a single page in this book.  Don't buy it.  If you must buy it, buy it used.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|sorry but this movie just made me mad. I was eagerly anticipating watchin this movie as I had seen the first and really enjoyed it.<br />Ok ive seen it now and I just have to say it is not up to the standards of the first. Its good and at times its a bit funny but for how long can a talking dog be funny? Its funny the first time, mildly amusing the second time it speaks and makes jokes but from then on you just wish it was out down.<br />It isnt really funny and didnt make me laughing out loud like the reviews said it would. It was just a film. An average film and not even the soundtrack that will smith done for this film was played during the film, it was only played in the end credits which is useless.<br />This whole fim was sloppy and tacky and it aint good enough. I wasted money renting it and I just hope they dont make another men in black after this.
6305807086|1.0|This movie seems scripted as if the screenwriter was involved in that parlour game where someone starts a story with a sentence and then the next person in line adds a line, and so on.  Except all the players commence the story after consuming some awesome 'shrooms. So yeah, its an amazing concept, and has some crazy premises and situations, and it is imaginative, but as is typical thoroughout the movie, the explanations of the basic concept of this film by old timers who aid the Cameron Diaz character are contrived and wholly unsatisfying.  By the end you're asking yourself \\"what happened to the Cusack character?\\", nevermind the Hollywood-politically correct coupling of the Keener and Diaz characters.  The movie has the feel that the writer took nearly his entire schedule writing the first half of the story, and that he finished the last half of the story in four hours to meet his deadline.<br />For those of you that say the movie satisfies your curiosity as to what it would be like to be someone else, in reality, the Cusack character is actually being himself only within the facade of Malkovitch's body.  In the late scene in JM's agent's office, where Malkovitch reveals to the agent of his impending \\"career change\\", JM takes on the persona of Cusack.  So what's the difference?  If that's all there is, then I'd rather be in Cusack's body.  And yeah there's the blatant, obvious, idea that one's talents are more well received if you're famous to begin with, but my 14 year old niece could have told me that, and I could have saved $8.00.<br />So rent it, watch it and forget it.  Its got nothing to say and is nothing more than a nihilistic roller coaster ride where all the great hills are at the beginning.  The roller coaster end up jumping the track, and you have to walk back to the park feeling only half amused.
B00005JLSC|5.0|After seeing the film, a few things come to mind.  Having been lucky enough to see the original cast of \\"Chicago\\" (Chita Rivera/Gwen Verdon/Jerry Orbach/Mary McCarty in Chicago at the old Congress Theatre back in the mid 70s, I'll bet Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon are looking down and smiling along with Chita Rivera (who had a very brief cameo in the film).  The film proves that the movie musical is not dead and hopefully is making a resurgence.  The five leads are terrific and deserve any award/recognition that they receive. The ensemble cast was excellent. Everyone involved in the film should be very proud. Go see it .......and enjoy.
B00005MP58|5.0|Colin Firth makes an excellent, snotty, Mr. Darcy. This is a tale about a British family that does not have a male heir, but instead has five girls. A wealthy man, Mr. Bingley, buys a home there and soon the town is all a buzz. To welcome the new resident they decide to have a ball in his honor. At the ball Mr. Bingley meets Jane. He is captivated by her beauty and sweet demeanor. His friends however do nothing to hide their disdain for such middle class foolery. Bingley tries to get Darcy to dance with Elizabeth, Jane's sister, he makes a snide comment about Lizzie's plainess and refuses to dance. What they do not realize is that Lizzie had heard his comments. Now she is disposed to dislike him. He on the other hand takes a second look and decides he likes what he sees, but she will not give him the time of day. Throughout the movie they dance around each other, dancing the steps of two very independent people learning to overcome social barriers and preconcieved ideas to find love where they least expect. Wonderful script, characters, and performances. It is fun to see Mr. Darcy overcome his pride and Lizzie her prejudice. This movie is well worth watching. One of the best Jane Austen movies ever made.
055325748X|5.0|A number of the readers who ranked this book poorly seemed to think they had read a novel, though the author says immediately that &quot;it must be regarded in its essence as fact.&quot; The narrator, Pirsig, is a man in early middle age, once a teacher of rhetoric and technical writing at Montana State in Bozeman. While there he became interested in the philosophical pursuit of an objective standard of quality or value (a larger form of the discipline of aethetics); this became an obsession when he entered graduate school at the University of Chicago, and the narrator eventually suffered a severe nevous breakdown. In a mental asylum he received 28 shock treatments over two years, destroying much of his memory. At the time of the motorcycle &quot;chatauqua&quot; that frames this book he has rebuilt his life, working as a a technical writer. He has remarried, fathered two children and come to think of himself as a wholely different person. He calls his earlier self  &quot;Phaedrus,&quot; (the wolf) somewhat ironically after a character in a Socratic dialogue. <br />The trip that reunites him with places and people not seen in years allows Pirsig a good deal of time to meditate on Phaedrus, to try to piece together his former life and how he careened toward insanity. Early in the book is an intimation, that his 11-year son, riding pillion on the cycle during the entire trip, is showing early signs of mental illness. This does not make him easier on the boy; he is instead surprsingly strict, bossy, even competitive, which makes him a vivid if often diasagreeable first-person narrator. (Chris Pirsig did suffer a breakdown, and lived only till about 20; he was still alive when ZAMM was published, however.)<br />I go into this at length because many of these reviews seem to ignore the fact that there is a solid overall narrative structure to the book--this, I think, is useful for potential readers to know, together with the fact that it is an unusual and honest memoir ofa man who has had a difficult life.
B00005YXZH|3.0|This is my first Wilco disc.  I know they are a critically acclaimed band and this disc has really been blown up.  I bought this disc on the basis of the rave reviews it was getting from everyone.  I must say, I am thoroughly disappointed.  I have listened to the cd many times and find nothing ground breaking or moving.  The first song is a good song as well as the &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; song but for me that is where it ends.  It's just boring and droll.  If that is what they were going for, they nailed it.  Beck's &quot;Sea Change&quot; blows this away.
0446608955|5.0|Having previously seen the movie and thinking it was really good I decided to get the book and read it.  The book to put it bluntly was much more detailed about the relationship between Landon and Jamie and also about how Jamies secret affects Landon, her and their relationship (I am NOT giving any spoilers). I found that the final 40 pages of the book were probably the most sad and at the same time inspiring thing I have ever read.  This is the only book that has almost made me cry for about 5 pages within the final part of the book.   It truly is a great book and I think I will get more books by Mr Sparks he is a great writer and I finished this book in 1 day (a first for me since Firestarter by Stephen King).
B000067DNC|4.0|Too cheap to pay for Showtime during it's original run, and unimpressed with the Stargate motion picture, \\"Stargate SG-1\\" didn't make it on my radar until the SF Channel started to broadcast reruns. What a pleasant surprise this series turned out to be. In spirit Stargate SG-1 reminds me powerfully of the original Star Trek, but set firmly in the late 1990s. Mankind is brash, flawed and out there exploring the universe, often before it's really ready.<br />Noteworthy is the series creators' careful attention to detail and continuity. Important ramifications from past episodes are not simply forgotten about, but are revisted in future episodes. Most importantly, this show has a great cast. Our four intrepid explorers of SG-1 have wonderful on-screen chemistry, and the support personnel back on Earth feel much like NASA mission control. Then there's the starring piece of hardware, the Stargate itself, as awesomely cool as any spaceship.<br />If I had to level a criticism, it's that most of the plots are less than original and will be familiar to most SF fans. I also sometimes wish that the writers wouldn't  pull their punches (there are times when I wish they'd gone for the throat like \\"Babylon 5\\" sometimes did). But these are fairly minor quibbles. This is simply wonderful SF entertainment.<br />As for the DVD set, some fans who've already seen all the episodes may be disappointed by the lack of special features.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|You only need to buy this if you only want one Beatles album (though if you want two: abbey road and white album!).  You'd be much better off buying all of them (slow and evpensive but more rewarding), they all have their own unique charm which is lost in a mix tape of their best.  Also, if you still have a record player buy all your Beatles albums on LP, they really do sound better!
B00006AW2E|5.0|Rather than echo the insightful comments of previous reviewers, I will try to add to what they've said.  In the mid 70s (when I was very young)I stumbled onto a discography of the Stones' early UK releases and recorded from a hoard of US vinyl albums onto cassette to recreate the UK sequences, which I always preferred. I applaud ABKCO for offering some of the UK albums on CD to American audiences; I wish only that the first 2 British albums were offered as well.  Regarding sound quality here, in the 80s and early 90s I made due with those awful ABKCO cassettes - this is a vast improvement, I guarantee.
B000068PQ0|4.0|The Flaming Lips are one of the best bands out there right now.  It's hard to be original anymore so to be original is a testament.  Yoshimi starts of superbly with Fight Test, 3001, and Yoshimi parts 1 and 2.  I think my favorite cut is Ego Tripping, who else can do this but the Lips?  The production is top notch and not overly done at all.  When you can put accoustic guitars and fat analog synth tones in the same song and blend so well, you are onto something.  Their previous cd Soft Bulletin is a classic as well so they were hard pressed to make a follow up to match the quality and they have done just that.  Can't wait for the next one!!
B00004WGAI|5.0|I can't improve on anyone else's review by saying anything different than the rest have--just that this is the most perfect adaptation imaginable. That it was a BBC production, instead of a cinema production, means nothing has to be left out or altered, as so many directors like to do. (Of course, its being a BBC production also means you have to turn the sound up to what would normally be a deafening level, but that's what you get.) <br />Before seeing the film I was a bit disappointed to think Timothy Dalton played Rochester, but I was quite wrong: He IS Rochester, getting him exactly, passionately right. As for Zelah Clarke, I do agree that a sense of suppressed passion is lacking in her performance, but not so much that the viewer feels cheated; on the whole she is a great Jane, and I enjoyed her playfulness in the ending scenes, in which she teases Rochester over her cousin's interest in her. <br />There is no possibility of your disappointment in this version; it's the only one you need to buy.
B00006CYAD|2.0|Simple Plan is exactly like Blink 182 just a little more childish. I would say their lyrics are good, but the way their music is and the way its sung isn't too great. To me, they sound like little kids singing. I give them two stars just for the lyrics, some are pretty good. Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying this CD. Too many bubblegum punk bands are coming out, and it needs to stop.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I've had this movie for  3 years now, but when I re-watched it again this past weekend, I couldn't help but say WOW! Everything is great and believable from the sinking to the freezing water.I usually fall asleep during 90 minutes movies, but I didn't even know 3 hours had gone by when I was watching Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet gave very very excellent performances and I couldn't help but watch it over and over again. I don't understand why people called it a \\"chick flick\\", but wasn't it that \\"chick flick\\" that made over $600 million in the US and & almost $1 billion worldwide making it the most popular motion picture of all time? I truly recommend it for anybody who hasn't seen it. It's worth your every penny and time!
B000002U82|5.0|I'm writing a review for this cd only because its average rating is an unacceptable 4.5 stars in an attempt to get it back to 5.  How the greatest album of all time can have a less than perfect rating just boggles my mind.
0609610570|1.0|An opportunistic manager who looked like a genius until the economy turned.Look at the merged Honeywell/Allied Signal today.
B00005OWEG|4.0|It's good to see that after 20 years, this film can still engender so much passion and controversy.<br />For my six cents' worth, I'll start by stating that neither the original or the Redux versions are perfect. Some inconsistencies of the original are \\"fixed\\" by Redux but I agree that some of the extra footage was superfluous, particularly the Playboy bunny scene at the Medevac hospital. However, the plantation scene serves to divorce the viewer from reality and adds to Conrad's vision of a world gone mad through imperialism in \\"Heart of Darkness\\". Don't forget Conrad based his novel on his experiences in the Belgian Congo over 100 years ago.<br />PS I would have loved more extras with the Redux release and it would have been great if Paramount had included Mrs. Coppola's ground-breaking documentary \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" about the making of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" with location shots and the pure hell of putting a masterpiece together. Perhaps there were copyright issues.
B00006F83Y|4.0|First of all This is a great album. I really havent heard anything like it before. And after reading many reviews i dont see how people can call it boring or repetitive or anything of that nature. Truth being this is proabbly one of the VERY best albums of this year and for one simple reason...I LOVE metal, and i love it alot, but theres too damn much of this \\"nu-metal\\"...out there that mixes Rock and rap and it dont belong and thats what makes this album so much better. Its time to stop mixing the \\"nu-Metal\\" ... and go abck to roots.and this is waht this album does.Its nothing but an hour of pure rock with its Energetic and Low moments that keep you listening. These guys keep it real and original and just a Good straight forward rock album. So basically to put it nicely either keep it Metal, or Keep it Rap, or Keep it Rock, And thas wut this album is Rock. Oh and by the way if your used to listening to the 3 Doors down radio freindly i have to sound like the lead singer of Creed Rock(like Nickelback,puddle of Mudd and 3 DD or anything like that) Then this album is not for you.
B00004W50T|5.0|The Big Pink is such a soulful album. I read once that Robbie Robertson's influence for The Weight was Bunuel. You can hear the influence on not only The Weight but the entire album. Each tune paints a portrait of a man on the verge of losing his soul. Love and insanity is driving the characters of these songs to the brink of losing their souls. Bunuel's films painted a very similar painting. These songs with their vivid imagery of magicians, cheating spouses,lonesome lovers and just plain desperate men must have been quite revolutionary to fans of psychedelic music back in 1968. The Band didn't need to have wailing guitars or feedback to paint their portrait. They used their sweet soulful harmony to paint their landscapes of lost souls.
B00006RIO7|3.0|Why, oh, why did they feel it necessary to include the Anastacia (Sp?) song and the hip hop thingy at the end?  What audience did they think was going to purchase the original soundtrack of a fine movie and want those two junky songs?<br />I have to race to hit the stop button before these songs come on my stereo.<br />Other than that, a great cd.
B000084T18|5.0|This cd is one of the best cds I have heard in a long time.<BR>Every track is hot and the lyrics are tight. For example \\"Im gonna love you like a fat kid loves cake.\\" ... GO COP IT NOW CAUSE YOUR MISSING OUT ON ONE OF THE HOTTEST CD's OF THE SEASON...
0880389052|5.0|Homeland is the first part of R.A. Salvatore's second trillogy starring the loved Dark elf Drizzt.  The Dark Elf Trillogy takes place before the Icewind Dale Trillogy and tells of the beginnings of the Dark Elf.  His evil family, and the one man (or elf) that changed his life forever.<br />This is the story that introduces us to the evil ways and lives of the Dark Elves, and how even the most evil can spawn something very different than they wanted.  That thing is Drizzt Do'Urden.<br />We follow drizzt from before his birth up until about the age of 20 (which is about 5 years old in human years).  If you love the Dark Elf as thousands of others do, but want to know more about his life before the surface, you will find it in Homeland.<br />5 stars.  The book is awesome.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I'm not normally the kind of person who gives incredibly high ratings, but this is AWESOME!  It's just one of those movies that when you see it, it hits something inside, you know?  It's a classic tale of adventure, suspense, magic, and romance.  This is a movie for all ages (about 5 to ...um....100!!...)  Chihiro, a 10 year old girl, is thrown into the Sprit World, where she meets a strange boy, Haku, who helps her.  She must work her way to gain her freedom from the Spirit World and display incredible kindness and courage to the least likely of \\"people.\\"  Also this movie has an incredible way of displaying that no one person can truely be all good or all bad (like in fairytales).  With that real life spin on it to top it all off, you have one of the best pictures, nto of the year, but of all time!!...  This is a definite must see!
B000002KEV|5.0|&quot;Made In Japan&quot; is Deep Purple at their absolute best!Once I put on this album I don't want it to end.&quot;Highway Star&quot; is my personal favorite on the album.I must admit,while growing up, to playing Blackmore's guitar break on this song over and over again to the point that my mother's sanity was truly.As for&quot;Smoke On The Water&quot;what else needs to be said?This is a timeless classic.The whole album is a masterpiece!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Everyone keeps comparing these girls to Britney Spears, Cristina Aguilera, and groups like the Indigo Girls or Spice Girls.  How further from the truth.  If your new to Tatu and wondering wether to buy this CD or not they are a teenage lesbian duo (the name tatu literally translated means girl loves girl).  Yet any band who plays with such Metal artists as Ramnstein and Prodigy is far from the Aaron Carter or Britney Spears genre.  They are more pop fuesed with Industrial (techno and hard rock).  Most of the songs are really electronic, hence the techno, and they sound alot more like Madonna than the Spice Girls.  The best songs on this album are &quot;All the Things She Said&quot;, &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot;, and &quot;Ya Soshla S Uma&quot; which means I've lost my mind.  If you want the shock rock style like Marilyn Manson or Skillet, but fuesed with Pop then you'll like Tatu; and if your one of those Avril Lavigne posers then try something real.  I hate most pop, but this group is pretty good.
B000085RTZ|5.0|This album is truly great, it shows how Kamelot has matured over the years. Keeping things straight to the point with yet another brilliant concept album, thus making Epica probably one of their best in history.
B000084T18|5.0|This album is one of the few rap cd's of recent years that you can pop it in the cd player and let it play from beginning to end, then go through the whole thing again and still not be tired of it. Don't let the radio singles fool you, the complimentary songs on the cd are hard, \\"grimey\\", hood stuff, that has been looked passed over for a while for the girly, pop rap that ja, which gets a nice little dis on track 10, makes. With help from Eminem on a couple songs and G-Unit throwin in it's work this CD is BIG. This cd has to be part of your collection if you're a true rap fan.
B00000JZC4|5.0|Hey guys and gals, If you want to hear something that is different yet very much appealing to both eyes and heart, listen to this cd, I think This group is genius for this.  I am not a hard rock person, nor do I declare this as such, but I do think its great listening.
B000084T18|4.0|I was a little bit hessitant to buy this album at first because I was afraid 50 went commercial. But I was wrong he stayed mostly true to him self and most of the songs on here are hot. With Back Down dissing Ja Rule it looks like there beef will never end. Now as for eminem saying this album will be as good as Illmatic, Ready to Die, Enter the wu the 36 chambers and so on. This album doesn't come close to them although it's one of the better albums I heard the last year and a half
B00005QIPH|5.0|Undoubtedly this album ranks in the top ten of the year.  It started a wave of new sound and a welcome relief from the overpolished pop music we are inundated with from the likes of j.lo and dave matthews.  Reward The Strokes for their musical courage to do something different -- this album is a great buy!
0316666343|4.0|I was skeptical of this book and it's concept at first but ended up really getting into it. I am not a religious person at all and was anticipating a religious overtone and it had none. I loved the fact that she wrote of a heaven that did not necessarily involve a god. I would absolutely recommend this book!
0930289234|5.0|In Watchmen, Moore has not only created an astounding work of art but has also shed light on all the important themes of comics.  Watchmen is it's own self contained story chronicling a world much like ours where heroes, super or otherwise, exist.  It's also an analysis of where the archetypal figures in all other comics originate.  He explores each character's past and how they came to be who they are today.  He also explores the common themes of comics: good vs. evil, the end of the world, the contrivance.  He's created a story that not only entertains but also teaches.
B0000013GT|5.0|Of course this is an amazing album!  Coming from the Atlanta hip-hop duo, this one was a classic the minute I bought it back in '96.  That is why I am here, purchasing it again, and telling all you young'ns that if you think Andre and Big Boi are hot now, you should  have seen them break out with this album.  It is by far the best one they have released to date, and any fan of rap and hip-hop music needs this album in their collection.
0790729628|5.0|While received poorly at the box office upon first release, Blade Runner has entrenched itself in the collective minds of moviegoers. Its greatness is evident by the number of new releases who continue to borrow visually from Blade Runner (A.I. and Dark City are prime examples). It is a shame Ridley Scott didn't devote more time to the sci-fi genre, instead of giving us \\"classics\\" such as White Squall, GI Jane and Hannibal. That aside I must agree with some of the other reviewers. I too enjoy the director's cut more, but would've liked to have seen both versions available. Each version has its own admirable qualities, but I think the narrated original is better for the casual viewer. I tend to straddle the fence of movie snob and \\"Joe Popcorn\\" and would like to have the option of watching either version as my mood dictates. And in all honesty, the narrated version is probably the only one I could get my girlfriend to watch.
B0000640SA|5.0|This is one of a new line of (future) classic movies of the last 5-10 years.  This movie blew my mind the first time I saw it and hasn't disappointed in subsequent viewings.  The movie is in reverse chronological order (if you didn't know already) and tells the story of a man who has no short term memory who is looking for his wife's murderer.  The film has a couple twists throughout, but the main course is the ending (or should I say beginning).  <br />This DVD is full of extra features as you can see by the list that ... provides.  The best of which is a version of the movie in the \\"correct\\" chronological order.  This version is almost as good as the original movie!  This is like getting 2 movies for the price of one.<br />I will admit that the menu's are a bit annoying in the sense that it can be difficult to get to some items, but there are navigation guides out there if you need help and you will get the hang of it.  <br />It basically comes down to this: if you like your movies on the edge, innovative and little off kilter, this is the movie for you.  If you into more straight forward flicks, then you should probably stay away.  All in all, this was one of thebest of 2001 and I say A+ and highly recommend this movie!
B00005BL2A|1.0|The cd title should be \\"Horrible\\". I am a big fan of Depeche Mode but this release is a big dissapointment. The songs \\"Dream On\\", \\"I Feel Love\\" and \\"I Am You\\" are the only tracks worth hearing in my opinion. I keep hearing all the talk of David Gahan's drug problem being a reason for bad work in the past. Well, with Exciter, I suggest you get back on the drugs if that's what it takes to produce good work!<BR>My amazement is that you can find many \\"Exciter\\" Bonus tracks on the internet that I haven't been able to find on the cd. And everyone of those Bonus Tracks is twice as good as what the group choose to put on their album. The guys definitely got the good and bad mixed up when deciding on which tracks to include with this release. Check out the bonus tracks on the net. If your a DM fan like me, you will probally be pleased with what you find. But don't bother with the Exciter release. Sorry Depeche Mode, hope you learned a lesson this time.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I maybe in a minority but I think DS9 was the best series of all. I thought the stories were better and the action in space was much more exciting. The final episodes leading up to the finally was the best of all the series.
B00005JLS0|4.0|First, let me me just say that Sandra Bullock is her usual cute quirkself in this sweet romantic comedy about a \\"save the world\\" lawyer who gets swept up by a rich tycoon, pleayed by Hugh Grant.  The story is simple, Bullock plays Lucy Kelson, a Harvard graduated lawyer who spends most of her time fightinf lost causes.  She is determined to save a Community Center that has stood in her childhood neighborhood for generations.  Enter George Wade, Grant, the tycoon whose company is planning on buildinga high rise condo community where the center stands.  He is need of a lawyer who can actually think while chewing gum (he's a bit of a womanizer, and his brother tells him to hire a woman with substance.)  In order to get her to work for him, he promises to save the community center and build around it.  Her new job turns into more of a personal assistant than Chief Attorney, as she has to help him pick stationary and clothes.  The line is crossed however when George calls Lucy out of her best friends wedding to help him pick out a suit.  In frusturation, she turns in her resignation and gives him two weeks notice.  He convinces her to stay long enough to hire and train a replacement.  The replacement comes in the form of red head vixen, June, played by Alicia Witt.  June moves in quickly, using her charms and her looks to get in the bosses..  um good graces.  Lucy realizes too late that she has feelings for George, and thinks she has lost him to June.  What happens next is what makes romantic comedy so much fun to watch.  This movie, while a little long, at just under 2 hours, is a gem and a must for any Sandra fan.
B000002HD5|5.0|The Afghan Whigs were the best of band of the 90's and this was their best album.  In an era where concept albums are a rarity, the Whigs produced this classic gem about love, lust and loss.  The Whigs created soulful rock that has been unmatched ever since their unfortunate breakup.  This albums flows as well as an album can, merging songs as if they were one song.  Greg Dulli sings with a passion not found in today's artists and is unmatched in his ability to perform.  If you like your rock n' roll with a twist of soul and Rn'B, pick this up.  The Whigs other albums also come highly recommended.  If you are new to the Afghan Whigs, this is the album to start with.
0761957553|5.0|Dr. Field,<br />Has written a book that should be an example to all others writing about: 1. SPSS and 2. Research methods. As a grad student I have been trying to put together all the stats classes that I have taken and the SPSS class I took and make sense out of it. This book was the final key that brought it all together. Based on logic ... its funny that the science of statistics should be so without logic as far as teaching goes. Again, this book is the way that books on stats and SPSS should be written. My only problems: 1. That while there is a lot covered, I wish that he would go through all (or almost all) of the statistical applications available in SPSS and 2. I would've liked to see a &quot;refresher&quot; on the commands to complete the statistical process talked about, at the end of the chapter. In summary, this book is the only book that I would recommend to those in need of help regarding SPSS and statistics. I can't wait for his new book, co-authored by Dr. Hole.
0060977493|5.0|I thought this novel was a wonderful exploration of Indian culture.  Even though the Christian Indian life was relatively unknown to me, the cultural implications that the novel deals with seemed to me both real and poetic.  Roy deals with, and has dealt with, an intricate and well-established society that spends very little time evaluating itself.  The political ramifications of this book in her hometown almost caused the book to be banned.  As for the quality of the language and the style of writing I think very highly of them.  She does not spare her characters and because of that their individual beauty shines.  This book is a beautiful work of art.
0375414053|5.0|I loved this book.  It was as though she was living my life - I work in the finance industry, have 3 children, was the main breadwinner in the house, quit when I had my third, suffered through temptation.  All of the stress, the helpful but clueless husband, the demanding bosses, the male jerks in the finance industry.  The nervewracking childcare issues.  It is all very true!  Now I know my husband isn't the only one out there not to realize that when there are things on the stairs, they should be taken up the stairs.  Kate is a bit edgier than I am, but darn this book was almost too realistic.  I did enjoy the satirical style, it helped me see some of the humor in situations that I have lived through.  It was a fun book that I was sorry to see end.
0792844890|5.0|Many view this movie as a step down from many of Mel's classics, but in my opinion, this remains one of the best comedies of all time.  Spoofing the widely popular Star Wars trilogy, Spaceballs is hilarious.  Mel himself, John Candy, the sound guy from the Police Academy movies, among others are all great.  It is pure comedy.  Cheesy at times, yes, but most comedies are.  This is slapstick in it's purest form.  <br />Extras are a little lacking on this DVD, but you can't beat the price. I have heard reports of a possible Special Edition, but no word on a date yet.

B00005YW4H|4.0|The only reason this album doesn't get 5 stars is due to the fact that Norah Jones did not write most of the music on this album.  Aside from that this is sweet, sweet music.  Norah's voice is as beautiful as I have heard in recent years and she sings with passion as if she wrote the words.
B0000024RQ|5.0|In late 1962, after Bob Dylan's debut album was deemed a relative failure.  Columbia was considering of dropping him off their label.  They felt (being the big record company they were) that they didn't need another second rate folk singer on their label.  However after some negotiating with producer John Hammond, Columbia gave Dylan one last chance in the studio.  What a redemption!  After some extensive sessions with John Hammond, where a load of material (most of it being Dylan's own) was recorded, Dylan's second album 'The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan' was completed.  Upon release it would gain critcal acclaim and be the first of Dylan's records to actually chart (at a respectalbe #22).  To this day it remains one of Dylan's most beloved albums and for good reason.<br />On his debut Dylan had only two of his own compostions on it and a bunch folk covers.  Freewheelin' reverses that formula and the majority of tracks here are Dylan's own.  The music itself is not complicated it's just Bob's acoustic and harmonica.  The lyrics are a different story though for this album defines Bob Dylan as a stellar poet.  And why not?  All these songs display Bob's artistic talent with words.  Whether it be the timeless classic BLOWIN' IN THE WIND, the beautiful GIRL FROM NORTH COUNTRY, the angry MASTERS OF WAR or the the poetic brilliance of A HARD RAIN'S A-GONNA FALL and DON'T THINK TWICE, IT'S ALL RIGHT.  These songs remain some of the greatest compositions ever written.  The other tracks here display Bob's talent, personality and undeniable wit.  DOWN THE HIGHWAY has some nice acoustic guitar work.  BOB DYLAN'S BLUES is outrageous fun.  Whereas BOB DYLAN'S DREAM has a bizarre sort of beauty to it.  OXFORD TOWN is a simple tune dealing with the complex issue of racism.  TALKING WORLD WAR III BLUES is one of Dylan's ranting songs where his brilliant wit is displayed.  CORRINA CORRINA is a nice loopy cover of the classic.  HONEY JUST ALLOW ME ONE MORE CHANCE is more fast paced fun.I SHALL BE FREE closes the album with Dylan's strang but clever sense of humor.<br />This album clocks at 50 minutes which was quite long for a record in 1963 however a ton of excellent material was recorded during the sessions for Freewheelin' and this is just a small piece of it.  Perhaps a double album would have been necessary?  Some tracks from the sessions like LET ME DIE IN MY FOOTSTEPS definetly should have been on this album.  Although not all of the material has been released a fair share of it has appeared on 'The Bootleg Series Volume 1-3' another essential Dylan collection of songs.  <br />In conclusion 'The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan' is one of the biggest landmark albums of the 1960's and easily one of Dylan's best albums.  It's a better introduction to Dylan than his debut album and was the first Dylan album I bought.  I purchased this album because I'm afraid that the turmoil in the world these days will lead to worse events therefore I needed to listen to a voice that would ease my fears worries.  This album helped and it made a big impact on my life.  Sure Bob Dylan's voice isn't the nicest singing but this album is more than just music.  It's some of the greatest poetry ever written.  Highly recommended!
B0000640SA|5.0|Wow, what a movie...I've had a few in the past that made me go directly to the internet to see what other people thought about the ending and specific plot elements.  This movie, right from the start, sucks you in and does not let you go until the ending credits roll by.  I was mad at first, some movies you really want to understand and this one lets a lot of the ending come from each person that watches it.  You can formulate your own stance on the ending from the various events presented in the plot.  A must see, and a great DVD!
B00000063U|5.0|Back in 2000 when Island released the Richard & Linda Thompson Best of The Island Years Collection, I was looking to whittle down the number of discs I owned and it seemed to be an ideal opportunity in regards to my Richard & Linda Thompson library: highlights from albums I didn't own were represented, material I was always curious about was there, and, in the case of I Want To See the Bright Lights Tonight, 7 of the 10 cuts were included.  I figured, hey, pick this up and I can get rid of IWTSTBLT as well as Pour Down Like Silver.<br />Yeah, I know: I also feel like I should be made to sit in the corner wearing a \\"Dunce\\" cap.<br />The Best of IS a superbly constructed compilation - heck, the songs that are on it are even in the same sequence as on this release, so what's the problem?<br />That this is an ALBUM, in the classic sense.  It has an intention, as well as a beginning, a middle, and an end.  The songs that are missing aren't the albums highlights, true, but that's only because all the other material is just so superb.  \\"We Sing Halelujah\\" (not on the greatest hits) is a wonderful song, and \\"Has He Got a Friend For Me?\\" and \\"The Little Beggar Girl\\" are...well, y'know something, some of these songs are the albums highlights...(damn!)<br />The rest of the material is some of Thompson's - heck, the WORLD'S - darkest: \\"Down Where the Drunkards Roll\\", \\"Withered and Died\\", \\"The End of the Rainbow\\"...the titles say it all.  But they're balanced by the drive and ...hope(?) in other songs like \\"When I Get to The Border\\", \\"Calvary Cross\\", and the title track.  For all of their hope and desire, the songs remain wise and world-weary.<br />Individually, these all remain great songs, but in the context of this album is where they really make sense.  Thompson's guitar work remains a unique talent, and Linda's voice is just superb (I have yet to find a solo Richard album this satisfying, because with his penchant for such dark, unflinching material, a voice as beautiful asLinda's provides excellent counterpoint).<br />Oh...and a word of warning: I picked this up after I'd gotten Shoot Out the Lights and wanted more of the same: this album is much more folky from songstyle to instrumentation and arrangemtents.  It took a while for this album to sink in, but, boy did it ever...<br />Selling this album (and Pour Down Like Silver)...wow, I can be a real [dunce] sometimes...
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent really shows that he has alot of skills and future potential. Gettin with Dre and Eminem really helped his sound.  The cd has accouple of hot club bangers! Hopefully we'll see alot more a 50 cent in the future!
0380977788|2.0|I know I'll get lambasted for this, but I'm having a hard time understanding Neil Gaiman's appeal of late.<br />I know what he's capable of. I've read the Sandman series.<br />I've read Neverwhere and Stardust and American Gods and Smoke and Mirrors, too. Neverwhere is unbelievably brilliant and creative. Stardust is cute, and clever, but not extraordinary. American Gods is clever, but undeveloped in its execution.<br />I also have Gaiman's other works with illustrator Dave McKean -- The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch: A Romance...the Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish...Dustcovers: The Selected Sandman Covers and others.<br />So I'm no stranger to Neil Gaiman.<br />Neither am I devoid of ability to recognize talent, creativity and passion.<br />That said, I must admit Coraline left me cold. Not much went on in the book. The characters were flat. And it seemed very dark for supposedly being a children's book.<br />Frankly, the same problem that plagued American Gods seems to run rampant through Coraline: a good idea left undeveloped.<br />Coraline starts out promisingly enough. A big old house. A curious little girl. A bunch of odd neighbors. And a locked door with a brick wall on the other side. Great premise. Lots of things could happen in such a setting.<br />Things do happen, but too quickly without any character development. The stories goes from zero to 60 in a couple of pages and then wraps up -- before any explanation is giving as to why this other world existed, who or what those \\"other parents\\" are, who the strange neighbors are, and why the little girls seems wise beyond her years, able to face terror with hardly a blink of her eye.<br />I think Neil Gaiman needs a hard-nosed editor, one who'll tell him, \\"Great idea, Neil. But it needs to be developed more.\\" Or, \\"Good draft. Could be published as-is. But I think it needs a bit more fleshing out in these areas...\\"<br />I said it in my review of American Gods, and I'll say it in my review of Coraline: Neil Gaiman is extremely talented and creative, but his best work is still ahead of him.<br />I can't recommend Coraline.
B00005JLEU|5.0|In one of the most engrossing cartoons of my lifetime, I was just wanting more. After seeing the film I wondered why it was such a limited release in theatres. Many of my friends who wanted to take their children could not as it was too far to see it. My children all loved the film and cannot wait till it comes to DVD.
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent's new CD: Get Rich & Die Tryin is a flawlessly crafted work of art. This WILL be 50 Cent's first big splash into the commercial rap/hip-hop market and he has hit the scene running in full stride. With a little help from Eminem, 50 Cent comes off as a professional coming thru with song after song of awesome material, in both the beats and the lyrics. 50 Cent is another rapper who has found a distinguished voice (flow) and he puts it to constant good use throughout this CD. Everyone has heard \\"In Da Club\\" which is a GREAT song but others on the CD really show how good he is, whether it's the tough street anthem \\"What Up Gangsta\\" or the smooth flow of \\"P.I.M.P\\", 50 Cent shows that he can do it with great delivery anyway he wants. So why 5 stars? Easy. NOTHING on this CD is worth skipping. Every song has a purpose and that purpose is to inform the listener as to WHO 50 Cent is and he does this through infactious beats and ill rhymes that don't ever stop throughout this awesome \\"big splash\\" CD from 50 Cent. This CD sets 50 Cent upon a pedestal of rappers, like Jay-Z, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, DMX and Ja Rule who have broken through to the mainstream audience with flying colours and he is indeed looking to be the \\"Next Big Thing\\". Check off another checkmark for Eminem and Dre for coming through with another protege who looks to be doing nothing short of taking the rap/hip-hop and the music world in general by storm!
B00005OCMR|5.0|Before I start, let me just say that I have loved TRON since I first saw it in the theaters in the summer of 1982.  I was 8 years old then, and while I can now, at age 28, recognize the plot holes and sometimes hammy acting, back in '82 TRON was a breathtakingly good romp.  Since 1982 I have seen TRON literally hundreds of times.  Perhaps thousands?  I lost count a long time ago.  For whatever reasons, I never get tired of it, and while some other SF and fantasy fans can claim to have viewed Star Wars or Star Trek hundreds or thousands of times, I'd have to say that, for me, TRON is at the top of the pile.<br />Getting down to brass tacks, and without spoiling the plot, TRON is a lot like BLADERUNNER in that it was way ahead of its time, and therefor suffered audience and critical apathy in the year of its release.  I don't think people were ready for either film, and perhaps not coincidentally both TRON and BLADERUNNER dovetail to form the cinematic bedrock of the Cyberpunk genre on the silver screen.  No cyberpunk movie made since 1982 can escape comparison to TRON and BLADERUNNER; either because of Bladerunner's grimy and dystopic future cityscapes, or Tron's abstract and surreal CGI-generated \\"world inside the computer\\".<br />In the years since its release, TRON has been much slower to attract the critical and public acclaim that is now heaped on BLADERUNNER.  But the acknowledgement is coming just the same, and Disney's 20th anniversary efforts are proof of that.  The DVD set itself is a wealth of refurbished footage, more colorful and vibrant than ever seen on VHS, along with piles of goodies wrapped up in a very TRONish menu.  One can spend hours flipping through the electronic pages of the bonus CD, and some of the cut footage like the 'love scene' fills in some holes that have always been apparent in the original release.<br />I would especially recommend TRON to that generation of movie-goers who only know cyberpunk through films like THE MATRIX or perhaps the truly awful LAWNMOWER MAN movies.  Watch this film if only to get a taste of what things were like when the fusion of computers with public life was in its infancy.  Those of us who grew up in the 70's and the 80's knew a special kind of electronic magic, before the internet, before truly virtual realities.  Take a wayback-machine voyage to the epoch of the quarter arcade, when the Atari 2600 was the home game console of choice, and we all blasted pixelated bad guys to the guitar riffs of punk and New Wave rock.<br />END OF LINEthe truly awful LAWNMOWER MAN movies.

B000084T18|5.0|I picked up this cd the day it came out.It was one of those cd's you purchase instead of burning.When i got to the store,the cd was already sold out so the store had to order another case,which convinced me i had to have this album.When i played it at home i couldn't believe my ears.I hadn't heard an album like this since B.I.G and early Nas.Dre's beats are awesome and 50's lyrics are fresh.\\"In Da Club\\"is already a classic big beat track,and Ja Rule takes a beating on this album.A new feud is born!!This album is like a throw back to when rap first hit it huge,definetly worth buying!!!
0312932081|5.0|I first read this book when I was 15 years old.  At that time I had never heard of Orson Scott Card, and I recall being somewhat skeptical because my mother had picked up \\"Ender's Game\\" and its sequel while visiting the LDS book chain, Seagull Books.  I'm a proud member of the LDS church, but especially at that age, I was loathe to embark upon a sappy, sermonizing, or otherwise heavy-handed LDS-influenced morality play.  OSC had a rep as \\"The Mormon science fiction author\\" and I was actually hoping more for a Clancy-in-space type techno thriller.<br />Well, suffice to say, \\"Ender's Game\\" blew my socks off.  This is a very adult novel, because its themes and setting are entirely adult, but the main characters are engrossing if only because I think any child, teenager, and most adults, can immediately empathize with Ender, or any of his cohorts.  Card has an uncanny ability to put the reader into Ender's head and thus we see as he sees, hurt as he hurts, so that by the time the novel is under way we are already caught up in Ender's tragic struggle to extract love and survival from a harsh, war-ready world.<br />I won't spoil the plot, but the only portion of the novel that dates is the Warsaw Pact.  Keep in mind that this book was written in a time when the Soviet era seemed like it would drag on forever, and you can understand Card's employ of this traditional monolithic bad guy.  But even so, the Warsaw Pact is simply a sideshow compared to the built-up horror of the Buggers, who we do not truly come to know until the final chapter or two of the novel.<br />I recently re-read \\"Ender's Game\\" after picking up the Bean-centered parallel novels \\"Ender's Shadow\\" and \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\".  I wanted to refresh myself on OSC's future history and the characters that dwell within it, before inserting myself into the Bean novels.  I'm 28 now and have joined the military, and I am stunned once again at OSC's gripping prose, the sharpness of Ender's journey through the Battle School, the grim necessities of real war, and the remarkable currency of the International Fleet's pre-emptive strike against Earth's enemy.<br />OSC is a masterfull writer, and \\"Ender's Game\\" is probably his finest work, even after all these years.<br />I would especially recommend it as a terrific starter novel for kids between 10 and 15 years of age, especially if they enjoy science fiction programs such as Farscape, Star Trek, or motion pictures like the Star Wars saga.  Parents especially might appreciate the fact that the tale is free from needless sex, profanity, and violence.  \\"Ender's Game\\" is a terrific piece of SF literature, yet new readers and younger SF fans won't have any trouble plugging into Ender's world, and the drama within it.School, the grim necessities of real war, and the remarkable currency of the International Fleet's pre-emptive strike against Earth's enemy.<br />OSC is a masterfull writer, and \\"Ender's Game\\" is probably his finest work, even after all these years.<br />I would especially recommend it as a terrific starter novel for kids between 10 and 15 years of age, especially if they enjoy science fiction programs such as Farscape, Star Trek, or motion pictures like the Star Wars saga.

B0000035E7|5.0|This could quite possibly be the best album that I own. It easily ranks up there with Soundgarden's 'Badmotorfinger', Pearl Jam's 'Ten', and Alice In Chains' 'Dirt'. This is it, people, this IS grunge. Raw, angsty, angry, intoxicated, grunge. This CD is up to it's ears in mindblowing lyrics, heavy, distorted, often disturbing guitars, swift bass, and of course to back it all up, simple, yet first-rate drums. Every song on this CD is a kicker, and a classic. I recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Melvins, or anything else that has a heavier, garage band sound. <BR>   ---3 favorite tracks---<BR>           Sifting <BR>          Paper Cuts<BR>Blew/About a Girl/Floyd the Barber

B000003S0P|1.0|With roughly 900 CDs in my collection, mostly rock-based, you'd think I could acquire some kind of appreciation for King Crimson, especially since prog-rock is my absolute favorite style. Sorry, but this review will be a dis to KC fans. Red is replete with a discordant lead guitar which meanders mostly aimlessly without a hint of melody. Songwriting and vocals sound like they were written and performed by Pink Floyd [imitators], but too amateur to get even remotely close. Track #4, Providence, is hard to define as a song because it sounds like several people testing out sound effects in a studio, and nothing more. The songs overall are coarse sounding, mostly due to guitar, but the lead vocalist is often off-key and can't reach notes. The songwriting seems baseless, uninspired, and even trivial. I rated this CD a 1 because I could not go any lower.<br />As it is obvious from the 5 rating that King Crimson fans love this album, LISTEN TO THEM if you already like KC. But if you're not, you may want to stick with old prog-rock bands ... or some excellent new ones ..., all available on this site.
0553801511|3.0|Robin Hobb is a readable, talented, inconsistent writer. Some of her books have been brilliant, while others hover around the 'good' level. Nothing she writes is outright bad, and that is true of this book too. It's occasionally hard to get into, and some of the exposition is overly windy. On the whole it's quite good, but again I suffer from expectations made high by the slathering reviews on this website, which led me to believe it was the second coming. It's really not. But it's pretty good.
B00005JM09|3.0|- Couldnt expect much, but the movie was a fun ride. Unlike the previous entries in the serie, Terminator 3 entertains us with its witty humor and none stop action sequences. I liked the movie, i liked it a lot. But, i did not love it! JUDGEMENT DAY is still the no.1 Terminator film to me, but Terminator 3 proves that a movie doesnt need a VERY rich plot to entertain audiances. Course, movies need plot, but this movie managed to entertain the entire theater i was in. However, if you are looking for a movie with a more depth and a plot, then look elsewhere, T3 is a one and a half hour fun ride with action, special effects, guns & glory, chases and explosions. And all in good humor. O'course i know people would dissagree with my rank for this movie, but since it wasent as good as it could have been, i have to recomment people to rent the movie before buying.
B000089A07|4.0|While I did enjoy this film, I think I do have to agree with a couple of other reviewers who said Edward Norton was miscast.  I think he's an excellent actor, but he didn't quite fit the role of Will Graham.<br />I don't understand why critics insist on calling this a \\"Hannibal Lecter\\" film.  The movie does include some scenes with Lecter, but overall this movie (as well as the book) is more about Will Graham and Francis Dollarhyde/the Tooth Fairy.  Ralph Fiennes does a superb job as the creepy Tooth Fairy, a killer with serious issues involving his grandmother and his facial \\"deformity.\\"  I was glad to see the movie bringing these issues, as they were not included in the previous screen version \\"Manhunter.\\"  These details make the character more believable, in my opinion.<br />Overall, this is an above-average film, and is enough to satisfy fans of \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"
B000084T18|4.0|Overall, this album is  a very good buy. With production from Dre and Rockwilder and guest appearances and production from Eminem lets face it, the formula for success is there. Add 50 cents unique mush mouthed battle lyrics and almost every song becomes a head nodder. With all the hype building up to this album, it almost lives up to it. Bangers include &quot;patiently waiting&quot;, &quot;in da club&quot;, &quot;blood hound&quot;, and the list goes on to include several others. This will be, hands down, one of the best albums of 2003, if not the best. We will wait and see what Rakim has to say later in the year.
B000088E6M|5.0|50 Cent has the most anticapted album of 2003. I reccommend every rap fan add this to their collection.
B00006ZSAD|5.0|The record is a great improvement in the vocal preformances of Beth Gibbons. If, in the Portishead albums, she had a great voice but still somehow immature, here she displays a great versatility and she easily adapts her voice to the sound of the songs. In some songs she sounds like Billie Holiday, in other songs she sounds like Nina Simone..it's really amazing, you would tell there are different singers throughout the record.<BR>HEr songwriting is also impressive. Together with Paul Webb they managed to write a great bunch of songs. The musical style is very quiet and relaxed..basically an acoustic version of Portishead. Being without the electronic base, all the songs tend to be more focused on the voice of BEth, however the arrangements are always interesting, albeit very simple. Most of the times the songs have just a piano and some guitar, sometimes a violin or a horn is in the background, but the vocals tend to predominate. The only song where there is a real orchestral arrangement, with some horns in the background, is Tom the model, which is the best song of the album and is a bit reminding of some motown stuff. Other real masterworks are Show and Sand River. But the general tone of the album is very good and there is not one single bad song. All in all, a great record, which establishes Beth Gibbons as one of the great singers of this decade.
B00006690G|4.0|I'm not all that well versed in rap or hip-hop, but like some of what I hear in the genre.  The Eminem Show is a catchy album and I admit that I like it, but at the same time, I can easily see why some reviewers consider it to be white boy rap.  So if you're not offended by the lyrics, you'll probably like at least part of this disc.
B0000844IT|5.0|...this movie is a masterpiece. Classic.  You honestly can't go wrong with this movie.  Action, horror,comedy...all in one.
B000088E6M|5.0|50 Cent is hotter then ever. Ever since late summer 2002, he has made the biggest mark on rap ever since Christopher Wallace, otherwise known as The Notorious B.I.G. New York and the whole rap scene have been waiting for someone like 50 Cent to come along and now they finally have it. Not to many people knew of 50 Cent before his summer hit \\"Wanksta\\" hit the streets and blew up. But now, everyone and there mother knows 50 Cent. You can't walk the streets without someone mentioning him. And with his new album dropping five days before it's original release date, he definitely knows what the people want. 50 Cent has made his mark on the rap game and he sures intends to keep it that way. With over 500,000 copies of his cd sold in just two days, we can all imagine how well his record sales are going to be. Selling well is one thing, but being the king of the rap game is another. Can 50 Cent do as well as the Notorious B.I.G.'s \\"Life After Death\\" album did? Selling ten million records (1 time gold and 3 times platnium). By the way 50 Cent is going, I think he will do just that. \\"50 Cent is the future, 50 Cent is now.\\"
0812550757|1.0|After the short thrill-ride that was Ender's Game, I expected another book with a similar plot, or at least as well-written, with some sort of connection.  I was to be disappointed.  In fact, Speaker for the Dead is so un-Ender's Game-like that it would be a misnomer to really call it a sequel.<BR>Speaker for the Dead takes place on a stupid planet with a stupid name where a bunch of stupid people that speak a stupid language live.  To even call Speaker for the Dead a novel is also a misnomer - its more of an ugly amalgam of tenuously connected, badly written prose about several matters, none of which engross the reader.  The characters are dull and unlikable.  The premise is horridly boring.  The setting is overdeveloped and stupid.  Yeah, pretty much everything about this book [stinks].<BR>In short, if you're looking for a quality companion to Ender's Game, don't read this ... psuedointellectual attempt at blending Asimovian elements into OSC's science fiction.  Get Ender's Shadow instead - OSC sticks to what he's good at writing there, and it shows.
0743216385|4.0|In his afterward, the late Mr. Ambrose admits that this book, which brought him great acclaim before and after the HBO series, was basically a very easy side project while he was between more scholarly books.  It's a very easy read and perfect for anybody who is normally turned off by histories.  That said, pure history buffs who eat this stuff up will enjoy it as well.  It's not &quot;dumbed down&quot; history - - - it's history told with a narrative that flows and attention to character.  Put another way, there's something hear for everybody - - wanna be history scholars and people who just want a quick read on the commuter train.<br />Ambrose has been accused of &quot;borrowing&quot; liberally without appropriate citation in other works.  Not much of a chance to cheat here because the story is really just the condensation and reshuffling of all of the interviews he conducted of Easy Company personnel over the span of about a year.  A good chunk of information included in the book is clearly based on unit histories and other sources, but the real story is told by the men themselves and simply organized and presented in Ambrose's text.<br />It's a remarkable tale to be sure.  The 101st Airborne, 506th, E Company was, in Ambrose's view, &quot;the best rifle company in the war.&quot;  There are plenty of units that would take issue with the characterization that this unit did more, suffered more, were braver or better than any other combat unit.  I'm sure the guys in other divisions who served in and around Bastogne (the 82d Airborne in particular) would have problems with such a characterization.  Regardless of whether Easy Company was &quot;the best&quot; by any kind of standardized combat measuring stick (which is, of course, impossible) the story of this company is a great microcosm for the story of just about any of the elite combat units in the European theatre.<br />Ambrose does a great job of developing real characters in the book - - so you identify with each member of the unit as opposed to just developing some vague understanding of the chain of command.  This book gives the reader a very good ground's eye view of what it was like for these guys to suffer through a couple of years of gruling training in the U.S. and then England and then 10 months of even more grueling combat from D-Day until the end of the war.  Read alone or in conjunction with books that provide a broader &quot;bird's eye&quot; view of the war in Europe this book is a great oral history.<BR> <br />All in all, a great story - - - and well told.
B000067CPX|5.0|One thing about just about any Chili Peppers album: you'll always get your money's worth.  This is no exception.  There are several great tracks on this CD: By the Way, Zephyr Song, Universally Speaking, Cabron, etc.  This is one of those CD's that will sit in your car stereo for months- because you can listen to and enjoy almost every track, even though there may not be that one amazing single (although \\"By the Way\\" is quite good)<br />I put this CD up on the same level with Californication, but not quite Blood Sugar Sex Magik (their best, IMO).  It's a great CD, and a must-buy for any moderate+ Chili Peppers fan.
B00006I53S|5.0|this is a good starter lens.  not a great telephoto or wide angle lens.  i use it with a canon 1ds.  very good.
B00004TDTO|5.0|There probably hasn't been a single movie in the last 30 years that has changed the psyche of moviegoers more than JAWS.  As I recall, people literally did not want to go back into the water!  Speilberg tapped into this fear and tapped into it rather well.<br />As someone who had a certain fear of water, watching this movie on the big screen as a kid, you bet I was horrified!  Today, JAWS still remains a classic.<br />To those who say that the shark looks fake and that a CGI one would've looked superior, well, I wish they would stop looking at movies through CGI-colored glasses.  Personally, I think Speilberg's Great White (though mechanical in close-ups) was truly interesting.   It had a certainly personality.  IMO, many computer-animated creatures today are rather uninspired creations.<br />Besides, JAWS is much more than just about a shark.  The story of greed at the expense of human life is truly interesting to see.  It also boasts some great characters as well, namely, Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and especially Robert Shaw as Quint, the old shark hunter with a Captain Ahab syndrome.  And what can I say that hasn't been said already about John Williams now timeless score. It's just magnificent!<br />Yes, JAWS does contain its fair share of frights, but Speilberg was wise in inserting genuine moments of humor as well to relieve that certain tension.   A movie shouldn't be all fright, all of the time.   Certainly, that scene with Chief Brody at the dinner table with his young son copying his every move was both humorous and quite touching.  It gave the movie heart.<br />JAWS  was the first movie to crack the one hundred million dollar mark.   Today, many movies seem to crack that mark with ease.  Yet, many of them are nowhere near as good as JAWS.   Has the movie-going public been dumbed-down as to watch anything and make profits for these lesser movies?<br />With all of this success, there was a downside.  JAWS did to sharks what another great monster movie, KING KONG did to gorillas - it gave these poor creatures a bad image and thus many were slaughtered.  Like I said, this movie really changed the psyche of people, in terms of fear of the water and a huge dislike for sharks.
B000002KHB|5.0|This CD from 1972 was from one of the early hard rock groups that were helping to form heavy metal and then metal.  While the titles of these songs may not necessarily ring a bell, fans of early hard rock will recognize at least one of the three most well-known tracks, \\"Highway Star\\", \\"Smoke on the Water\\", and \\"Space Truckin'\\".<br />Listening to \\"Highway Star\\", you can hear one of the roots of 80s rock of various genres.  Music similar to this would later be called glam rock or big hair rock or art rock.  Whatever you call it, this song has a driving, fast paced sound with crunchy guitars for sure, but it seems like everything crunches in this song.<br />\\"Maybe I'm a Leo\\" has a slower and thicker beat than \\"Highway Star\\", and seems to have a harder edge because of the backing bass.  The lyrics are sparse for a nearly five minute song, relying more on the music to carry the theme.  This song compares well to music that at that time was contemporary with Black Sabbath.<br />\\"Pictures of Home\\" is another hard driving song.  The guitars are nearly attack instruments on this song, pounding out chord after chord, dueling with an organ for dominance; hard rock that influenced contemporary groups such as Emerson, Lake and Palmer.  It is sometimes difficult to tell who influenced who because of the pace at which rock was advancing during this particular time frame.  Sometimes the influences went both directions.  \\"Never Before\\" falls into a similar vein.<br />\\"Smoke on the Water\\" is likely the best known Deep Purple song.  The song starts with a riff that makes the song instantly recognizable.  The instruments all work together on this song and create a hard rock masterpiece that has influenced many other groups.<br />\\"Lazy\\" is the longest song on this CD, and I suspect it owes some influence to King Crimson and possibly to Led Zeppelin.  While most of the music on this CD is definably hard rock, elements of progressive are occasionally evident.  In this song there is a strong progressive element, as well as a notable jazz element.  When the lyrics kick in about four and a half minutes into the song, the lyrics are sung blues style, and a backing harmonica enhances the blues styling.<br />The CD finishes with \\"Space Truckin'\\".  This song kicks off with heavy guitar crunches and hard driving drums, and there is a hint of echo or reverb in the vocals, with a dominating organ.  We once called this type of music acid rock for the electronic effects used as well as what we perceived to be the drug-oriented theme of the song.<br />This music is best played with a good stereo system that will bring out a good balance of the bass and treble.  With a really good system the potential to annoy your neighbors for at least two or three blocks is pretty high.  While it is possible to listen to this music turned down lower, you tend to lose a lot of the sound that is available, which is often a characteristic of hard rock.  More seriously, if you like early Led Zeppelin, or consider yourself an aficionado of hard rock, this CD is a must have.  The three songs mentioned earlier are staples of stations that play classic hard rock, as well as 70s rock.  Deep Purple was influenced by a number of contemporaries, and influenced them in return.  Some of Deep Purple's riffs found their way into 80s rock, and you will occasionally be reminded of various 80s groups on some songs.  However, remember that this CD was from 1972 and Deep Purple was there first.  Five stars for a great early hard rock album.ng progressive element, as well as a notable jazz element.

More seriously, if you like early Led Zeppelin, or consider yourself an aficionado of hard rock, this CD is a must have.  The three songs mentioned earlier are staples of stations that play classic hard rock, as well as 70s rock.  Deep Purple was influenced by a number of contemporaries, and influenced them in return.  Some of Deep Purple's riffs found their way into 80s rock, and you will occasionally be reminded of various 80s groups on some songs.  However, remember that this CD was from 1972 and Deep Purple was there first.  Five stars for a great early hard rock album.
0671027344|3.0|I did not entirely hate this book.  Far from it.  I enjoyed it to an extent, though did not find it to be the insightful though-prevoking novel I was anticipating after reading some of these reviews.  Granted, this book does have a well developed scenario and is relatable, but I do not feel like I gained anything intelectually from partaking in this experience or lack there of.  I am only a high schooler, so really, what do I honestly know about world literature?  A fraction of what I should, I admit, but I do know there are greater books that have had a larger impact on humanity then \\"Perks of Being A Wallflower.\\"  Try something existential, or look in to some of the writers of the beat generation, whose techniques, I believe, Chbosky had the sense to imitate.  But if you are just starting out reading, then perhaps you should disregard my review and start small, but work your way up to someone of promising literary merit.
0312932081|5.0|Orson Scott Card has quickly become one of my favorite authors, mostly because of his work with the Ender series.  Card takes you on a four-book journey through the amazing life of a truly remarkable man.  Ender's Game ends with Ender still in his teens, and in later books you are taken to the end of his life.  Don't be fooled by the cover art.  Spaceships and aliens play a relatively minor part in this story.  Ender's Game is by far one of the best books I have ever read.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I still cant believe to this day how damn good this cd is...its mindblowing, this cd puts the energy back in music, i would recommend this to anyone who just likes good music, simply put, people who wrote bad reviews about this obviously dont have a good taste in music, so ignore all of them and pick it up, its your loss if you dont
B00006J9OT|5.0|This is a refreshing album that has a lot to offer in terms of musical value and quality of performance. Unlike Norah Jones, Diana Krall's talent for improvisation keeps the listener absolutely enthralled and energised for the entire performance, but doesn't neglect musical sensitivity, especially on the 'quieter' tracks.     After hearing this version of \\"I Love Being Here With You\\", it's difficult to go back to her earlier (slower) interpretations, but it's worth it! The track only gets better with familiarity. \\"Maybe You'll Be There\\" is positively wicked, with nuances that completely change the subtext of the song from earlier recordings, but make it just as good in different ways. \\"Devil May Care\\" is breathtaking, with an impressive, sensitive introduction, and then a wonderful upbeat song that will knock your socks off!...
B000000OQF|5.0|I sat and read the lyrics while listening to the song. an absolute picture into street life.  some of the best guitar work i have heard ever.  great transitions and axl's voice is the best it has ever been.  every song is a classic and would be a hit on any radio station.  just a timeless classic that i would recommend!
630305904X|4.0|This movie is one of those that you must be in the proper mood for.  The pace is slow, and there are often long pauses in the dialogue, filled by the haunting, wide eyes of Tilda Swinton.  But if you are relaxed and open to this movie, it is a wonderful experience.  It is beautifully photographed, and spiritually fulfilling.  Loved it!
B000000Y87|4.0|I'm a jazz novice.  I picked up this album, my first Bill Evans disc, after hearing \\"Blue in Green\\" (from \\"Kind of Blue\\").  Although I'm enjoying the album, I have a little problem: I'm not a big fan of the bass.  I'm told that LaFaro was a genius; I'm sure he was, but personally, I don't really \\"get\\" this instrument (yet).  Hopefully in time that will change, but since I only found out after purchase that the numbers on this disc were selected with an emphasis on LaFaro's role, I thought I would pass along a word of caution to other inexperienced listeners.  That said, Bill Evans's piano playing is just great.  I might try \\"Waltz for Debby\\" or one of his earlier albums.  Or one of his solo \\"Conversations\\".
B000002UAF|5.0|I can't believe some people have given this album a bad review!  It is their 4th album and the last before they got into the Dylan influence.  The height of their early stuff and a definite classic.
B00007E8O5|5.0|I've been a casual fan of AIC for a few years, so when I heard that Jerry Cantrell was set to release DEGRADATION TRIP this past spring, I was mildly interested. After hearing \\"Anger Rising\\" on my radio station, I felt that it was worth downloading a few songs to sample the CD before buying. Unfortunately the first one I decided to grab was \\"She Was My Girl\\" (his contribution to the SPIDERMAN soundtrack if I remember correctly), which I was none too impressed by. I dismissed the record and pretty much forgot about Jerry until a few days ago when I saw the 2-disc set of this album at my local store. I decided to give it a chance, and boy am I glad I did...<br />The other reviewers have hit the nail on the head by calling this one of the best pure rock records in several years, and it's a dirty shame the record company didn't promote it, and even worse that radio stations didn't give \\"Anger Rising\\" much airplay to attract more attention.<br />While the music is fairly straightforward heavy rock / metal on most tracks, the lyrics are brutally honest and fairly deep (much like those found on TRIPOD), and the melodies are much more interesting and experimental than the corporate rock found on today's airwaves. After listening, I found there to be several exceptionally good tracks (rivaling material from my favorite band, Tool). Among them are \\"Siddhartha\\" (hands down the best cut in my opinion), \\"Solitude,\\" \\"Spiderbite,\\" and \\"Gone.\\" In addition, the mainstream rock types \\"Anger Rising\\" and \\"Angel Eyes\\" never seem to get old; both tracks feature extremely catchy harmonized vocals. Other tracks of note from the original recording released in June 2002 are \\"Hellbound,\\" an incredibly catchy pure metal track; \\"Psychotic Break,\\" the odd but satisfying dismal opener that will, again, be stuck in your head for days; and \\"Bargain Basement Howard Hughes,\\" a dark number inevitably referring to Staley.<br />The new tracks may be of slightly lesser quality on average than the originals, but that doesn't mean there aren't some very good ones in the mix. \\"Hurts Don't It?\\" is an instrumental that recalls \\"Whale and Wasp,\\" and is a personal favorite. \\"Pig Charmer\\" is interesting in that Jerry sings from Staley's point of view, and seems to imitate his vocal stylings while doing so; it is also a ridiculously catchy (though dark) track. The ultra-funky \\"S.O.S.\\" and straight rocker \\"Locked On\\" are also highly recommended.<br />All in all, there are very few disappointing tracks, and there is more variety on this collection than on any AIC album. In fact, I would go as far as to say this effort is on the same quality level as DIRT and JAR OF FLIES. The great thing about the CD set is that it combines elements of both of those records; everything from intstrumentals to acoustic numbers to relentlessly heavy songs are found, and they blend together fairly naturally. Next time you go to the music store with the intention of grabbing the latest Nickelback/Default/etc. spinoff, make sure you at least consider picking this up too.
B000063V8S|5.0|With season two, TNG began to hit their stride. While some of the episodes from season one were tentative and awkward, there were very few missteps by the time of seasons three and four. Despite comments posted in other reviews (about the great but very different DS9 for one), there was considerable character growth. TNG focused on a ship that went to a variety of port of calls; this gave the show a focus on external stories. DS9 on the other hand focused on the internal conflicts because of the more static environment. Both are outstanding shows with very different approaches to their material.<br />The story arcs in TNG began around the second season and, although they aren't quite as convoluted as DS9, TNG didn't really lend itself to those type of stories. Season four opened with a fantastic conclusion to The Best of Both Worlds. This conclusion to one of the series early arcs (begun in the last episode of the first season, continued on in season two in one episode and carried further forward during season three with two pivotal episodes. Season four saw the conclusion to the cliff hanger and at least two episodes that built on the previous stories as Picard tried to deal with what had happened to him)is both powerful and dramatic. It really could have been carried over to a third episode.<br />The picture quality is outstanding (an improvement over season one and two). The extras have improved as well. For those fans disappointed with seasons one and two, three and four are a great place to start.
B000002LSV|5.0|ZZ Top has got to be one of the best ever, and most underrated American Rock bands.  How cool is that &quot;guitar spin&quot; trick they do?  Who else could do that?  This album has some of their best ever.  &quot;Gimmie all your lovin'&quot; &quot;legs&quot; and &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; alone are worth the price of admission folks.  You can't go wrong with this one...and if you look at the album cover real close...you can see what greatest it really is!
B000084T18|4.0|Let's cut through all the hype first. 50 Cent is by no means a great MC. He doesn't have the lyrical complexity of Rakim, the intricate flows of Biggie or the groundbreaking content of KRS-ONE. What he does have is a raw fire and authentic swagger that comes off more vivid and believable than perhaps anybody in the game since Pac. In addition, 50 Cent has perhaps the most valuable skill in the modern rap game. He knows how to write songs (complete with introductory adlibs, choruses, and even some  adrenaline fueled trash talk at the end of songs). It's what seperates MCs who can kill a cipher or a mixtape verse from rap superstars who command heavy radio rotation. <BR>  50 brings the whole package together perfectly on the Dr. Dre produced lead single \\"In Da Club\\" where 50 lays out his mission for '03: \\"They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac/But Holla in New York and n*ggas'll tell you I'm local/the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold\\".<BR>   While 2Pac's icon status may not be within reach, this album definetly brings enough heat to keep the street's feeling 50. \\"What Up Gangsta\\", \\"Many Men\\" and \\"Heat\\" are pure nitro, but the album reaches it's testosterone feuled apex on \\"Backdown\\" where 50 calls out Ja Rule and the whole Murder INC over a broodingly menacing Dr. Dre concoction. While lacking the lyrical wit of Jay-Z and Nas's now legendary verbal barbs, in terms of intensity and pure venom, 50's diatribe is rivaled perhaps only by Pac's \\"Hit 'Em Up\\".<BR>   Careful not to neglect the radio, \\"21 Questions\\" allows 50 to play the sensitive thug over a smoothed out beat. The Nate Dogg hook is just the icing on the cake. And finally, careful not to forget any segment of the market \\"P.I.M.P.\\" rolls with a slowed down southern bounce. 50's slow delivery flows like molasses on the track, making the cut, surprisingly one of the album's highlights.<BR>    At 19 tracks including bonus cuts, the limited subject matter does get repetive at times. And when the productions falters, such as on the Rocwiler filler track \\"Like My Style\\" 50's slightly slurred flow can come off as boring. But overall, Get Rich or Die Trying will almost certainly be one, if not the most successful hip-hop debut ever, and of the millions who will likely buy it, few will be dissappointed.
B000088E6M|5.0|This album reminds of the good hip-hop days, 2pac and Biggie would appreciate this album. With all the bubble gum rap in the game(Ja Rule, Nelly) this gives a twist of gangster with a touch of cockiness. The beats are great and 50 knows how to put a good hook. No female singers, no whining voices just real ...!

0064407667|4.0|I knew I had to buy these books for my children because the author warns us just how awful, depressing and miserable the lives of the Baudelaires are.  And he's right.  Poor kiddos; dreadful things happen to them but they have each other.<br />The writing style is a rather dry, but humorous.  The villan is over the top- filthy, shiny, with icky tatoos, nefarious plots, and worse friends.  Violet and Klaus each have admirable characteristics; Violet is an inventor, Klaus is an avid reader.  Sunny didn't seem so sweet initially because she is a biter, but she isn't a random, vindictive biter.  The children (or orphans!) may seem to be lacking depth, but Lemony Snicket just doesn't go deeply into detail on their emotional lives.  Yes, they miss their parents, they cry, but he doesn't dwell on it.<br />I saw through the evil plan of Count Olaf right away, as well as the general idea the books will follow, but I'm not 8.  Younger children will be held in suspense a bit longer than most adults.  :-P<br />My 8 year old daughter doesn't like these books yet.  She doesn't have a droll sense of humor that is necessary to appreciate them, and she has a huge fear of Bad Things Happening to Babies; a Bad Thing happens to Sunny, at which point my daughter slammed the book shut and declared it dreadful.  I might have her skip the first book and go to the second............. oh, but she might not like having snakes portrayed as Bad Guys.<br />I would certainly recommend these books over the Goody Two Shoes \\"Boxcar Children\\".  These have depth, humor, include new vocabulary words, and fantastical situations.
B0000640VN|3.0|The movie, while somewhat cliche', was an adorable romance with one big problem.  I found myself constantly distracted by Meg Ryan.  I kept hearing my mother saying things like sit up straight, comb your hair, or ladies never chew gum in public.  By the end of the movie I was surprised that I was actually aggitated at Meg Ryan for not combing her hair. :)  I would have given it 5 stars if not for Ms. Ryan.  However, if you like her you will love this movie.  I personally found her gum smacking quite annoying.
B00005JLRR|2.0|We should all be so lucky.  I've been a ST:TNG fan from the beginning, and had to be one of the first to see it.  Unfortunately I found myself yawning, looking at my watch, shifting uncomfortably in my seat...I was bored kids!  <BR>What an unbelievably talky installment, and with so many words, you'd think they might have been able to find something to say.  Not the case.  :(<BR>Some effects were cool, but save your money.<BR>Truly an upsetting end for such a great cast.  I have to agree with another reviewer's comparison of \\"nemesis\\" to Dr. Evil.
B00006IUL7|2.0|Other than this movie having a great cast, it was incredibaly boring. My husband and I could barely keep from yawning throughout the whole thing.  Some other people I know said the same thing, it moved very slow, and seemed to go nowhere. I would not reccomend it.
B000066NW0|5.0|For someone this young & fresh on the scene, Avril's got it goin' on. Showing that girls can be bad a**es too, Avril is definately on her way to stardom.
B00006IUL7|4.0|I didn't think I'd like this movie as much as I actually did.  It surprised me, I thought it was sad, but the story was very good, and so was the acting.  I highly reccomend this movie.
B00005RFAI|4.0|This album was great, it showed a fresh & more independant side of Pink. I like how she kinda broke away from that so-called pop-princess image people say she portrayed. This album shows \\"the edge\\" side of Pink we all enjoy. Check out the duet with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, it rocks.
0448060191|5.0|I read Little Women by:Louisa May Alcott. <BR>   This book is an amazing book.  It does not necessarily teach you lessons on how to live, but from reading the book you learn alot.  I enjoyed this book so much.  It taught me about family, love,  sacrifices, hardships, and alot more.<BR>   When Beth goes and visits the Hummel family and gets Scarlett Fever from the baby, you sense alot of feelings from everyone.  That was a very intense part for me.  Also when the Dad gets sick, and the Mom leaves that is another intense part.  Alot of things happen that make you feel like you do not know what is going to happen.<BR>   Then the sister's start to grow up and fall in love.  You get to know them so much throughout this book. When they feel something like when Jo thinks Beth loves Laurie, the guy Jo met and become friends with, and then goes away and lets Beth have him.  That hurts to know how she is feeling.  But when Jo meets Professor Bhaer and starts to fall in love with him you get very excited.  <BR>   I was did not specifically like how the book ended becuase I wanted something else to happen that did not.  But I still think this was a great book and I reccomend it to anyone searching for a book that you can not help but care about the characters.
B00005T7I1|3.0|This was a fun movie, with many similarities to a comic strip, such as the villians and the colors, but I don't think that Warren Beatty could have possibly been worse. He was so cheesy in it, and granted, it's a rather un-serious movie, but man was he bad! Al Pacino was great though and even received an oscar nomination for this one. Madonna was more attractive in this role than any others she has taken on (A League of their Own, Evita), and Dustin Hoffman's tiny role as Mumbles was fascinating. Obviously don't see this movie expecting to see reality. The backgrounds were extremely fake, as well as Beatty's acting. It's fun to watch though. The PG rating was surprisingly too mild for this film. There is a substatial amount of (nongraphic) violence and even some sexual innuendo. It was fun though.
3438052199|5.0|If you are going to buy the Old Testament in Hebrew than this is the one to buy.  It is the standard that is used by almost all scholars. It is the one we used in my University courses.  If that doesn't convince you the introduction will.  It is a lengthy descripiton of how the text came to be and about the various scholars who worked on it.  Furthermorre it explains the many footnotes which show variations in the Targum, Syriac, and other famous editions. It's worth the price.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Wow! The entire movie, all that I could think of was \\"this is a great movie.\\" I was never bored, and who could be with Al Pacino and Russell Crowe? This was an incredible movie, and I am so surprised that it didn't receive any of the 7 academy awards for which it was nominated. Anyway, I think that this is certainly Russell Crowe's best work, even better than his academy award winning performance in the following year's \\"Gladiator.\\" Al Pacino once again delivered a stunning performance, and even Christopher Plummer had his moments. All of the actors got into their roles, the cinematography was great, the dialogue was gripping. This was a 5 star movie, but probably not one that kids would enjoy, for several reasons, including the 2 hour 40 minute length. Not that it would be appropriate for children anyway; it's R rating was a deserved one, with a substatial amount of explicit language. Other than the language though, there is nothing \\"wrong\\" with the movie.
B00005221M|5.0|The directors of our day could really learn something from Direcor Michael Mann. He actually pulls off a &quot;Romantic War movie&quot;! Possibly one of the great movies of the 90's. Kudos to Daniel Day Lewis for his acting. And also, the movie does a good job of portraying the Native American Culture and the differences in culture and the relations with the French and the English.<br />The DVD itself was well done. Anamorphic widescreen is good quality. One downside is the lack of special features.
1573229725|3.0|When I received my copy of Fingersmith, I immediately started to read it.  I made it to about chapter 4, then stopped for awhile.  This book is one of the strangest things I've read in my life.  It has some really wild plot twists and involves quite a few &quot;controversial&quot; themes.  If you like reading modern Victorian literature or you enjoy stories by Charles Dickens, Fingersmith is a must-have for you.
B000088E6M|5.0|This CD is perfect! Probably my favriote ever! Better than any other cd shady records has produced or equal to devils night. It has eminem in it and 50cent is much better in this album than others. buy it =)
B000002UKS|5.0|I know I am a little late for writing this review. Having said that, i bought this CD when it came out. It is on my list as one of the greatest Rock Cd's of all time. All the songs are good, everlong is my favorite song, but each song is good in their own way. Buy it, its great.
B000084T18|4.0|They're not going to like me for this!!!!  50cent  comes at you RAW......With cathy lyrics and street slang........... The Lyrics are crucial.....The beats are DRE's so you know there tight!!!! With the G-unit and EMINEM's production this album is a can't miss. 50 cent has been listening to 2PAC and thats a good thing for him.........He's delivery is different and he knows how to put some humor in the RAP game but at the same time, he can do the damn thang!!! Go get this album and don't bootleg it!!!!!<br />DREW 2003
1891252089|5.0|David Swenson is a fantastic teacher.  In this book and in the related video, he comes across as a caring, careful guide to breathing and asanas.  He emphasizes practice, but also lets you know why you are doing what you are doing.  And he does so in a way that is neither patronizing nor pseudo-mystical.<br />As I am not particularly limber, I liked his allowances for those of us who are not able to reach the full extent of the pose.  Other teachers can be somewhat exclusionary, and even virtuosic in their practice, and David - despite being amazingly flexible - is not.  <br />The fact that the book is spiral, and thus ideal for use when you are on the mat, is indicative of the thought David puts into his books, videos, and, I imagine, his courses. <br />I have been using this book for two years, and I imagine I will be doing so for a long time to come.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I became interested in Wilco after hearing the song &quot;How to Fight Lonliness&quot; on the Girl Interupted Soundtrack (from Wilco's earlier album Summerteeth). I haven't heard their earliest work, but this is definitely not alt-country. I LOVE this CD; it has so many standout tracks that you don't feel like you're tolerating some so you can get to the better songs. The melodies are catchy enough that it's perfect for driving around in the summer, but the lyrics are profound enough to listen to while chilling in your room. I especially like &quot;Radio Cure&quot; and &quot;Jesus etc&quot;. Similar sounds are Cake, Jack Johnson...another less well-known group I reccommend with a similar sound is the Walkmen.
0783226837|4.0|I have been watching this movie on t.v. everytime it comes on.  I've always liked it.  I decided to get the DVD, and I love it!  It gives you an alternative ending, gives you insight on how the movie was made.  I'm not a technical buff, so I can't recite technical terms and buzz words.  I can only say it is a light, easy to watch movie that is very well made.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat, has some wonderful actors, and not a whole lot of gore or foul language, two features that seem to be the modern  way of film making these days.  Films today seem to be short on story and long on shock value.  I don't think this movie is too intense for the younger set, either.  A good pizza or popcorn movie!
B00005JKES|2.0|Its interesting to re-visit this show---but I have to say big doses of it are harder to stand than they were when it first came out.  In those times it was cutting edge tv! These days, compared with say Six Feet Under its rather passe.Nice to have...but really a once watcher!
B00005MP58|5.0|I love Jane Austin!  I first saw this series on A&amp;E.  I thought it was great.  I didn't know, however, how much better it could be until I got the DVD!  The detail is so much better!!  I'm a period costume fan, so I was delighted to find that the detail of the costumes was so much more visible with the DVD.  I also swear that there were extra scenes.  The extra features (location info,  actors' bios and interviews), all the behind the scenes features were great!  All in all, I feel that if you are wavering between VHS and DVD, definitely go with the DVD, you won't be disappointed!
B00004TJLD|4.0|I was thinking this was the DTS version,but it still rocks.
6304994540|5.0|Before anything is really said, you must know that this comedy is not like anything you'll ever see.  You may find movies with a slap-stick slacker style, but none like &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.  The movie stars Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude'; or of a more formal nature, Jeff Lebowski.  Alongside The Dude there is the always funny John Goodman.  Goodman plays the part of Walter Sobchak, who is The Dude's best friend and bowling partner.  And what makes the duo so hilarious is how their sometimes subtle humor flows throughout the entire movie.  Part of that humor may be the fact that neither Goodman or Bridges go two minutes without using the F word.  It's 'F-this' and 'F-that' and you just get used to it.<br />What really gets the movie going is when a China-man (or an Asian American, which is the preferred nomenclature) relieves himself on The Dude's rug.  He them comes to find that the China-man was actually looking for was a different Jeff Lebowski, who becomes known as 'The Big Lebowski'.  The Dude then persists on getting his rug back and pays TBL a visit.  He says no and the movie seems to be at a standstill.  But then TBL's wife (played by &quot;American Pie&quot; star Tara Reid) is kidnapped and the whole movie takes off in different directions.  But I'm not going to ruin any more of it for you; you'll have to see it for yourself.<br />The Coen Brothers, who've helped make movies like &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; and &quot;Fargo&quot; become what they are, give us something new to laugh it.  And it includes the star of &quot;Fargo&quot; Steve Buscemi (who is the third member of the bowling team), as well as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, and John Turturro.  There's also an awesome appearance by Sam Elliott who introduces (by voice) and concludes (in person) the film as the infamous 'Stranger'.  His character really adds the movie's excellence.<br />All in all, this movie is just a great piece of work.  It ranks #10 on my list of favorite movies, if that says anything--and it should.  There's no way you can hold back the laughter; and if you're able to you must be mute.  As I said it is a different sort of twist on comedy, but then so was &quot;Fargo&quot;.  And if you liked &quot;Fargo&quot;, then you'll love this one.  The cast is terrific and it is without a doubt the best performance I've ever seen Jeff Bridges play.  So if you're lazy, or even if you're not, make sure you see this movie.  You'll truely appreciate it, I'm sure.that says anything--and it should.

So if you're lazy, or even if you're not, make sure you see this movie.  You'll truely appreciate it, I'm sure.
0679642382|5.0|A.S. Bryant weaves a romance that can only truely be appreciated when the book is finished.  It is like watching a tapestry be woven, only fully appreciating its beauty when all of the strands are interwoven and fall into place.  An excellent book.
0780631684|5.0|I don't understand why everyone is saying that this is a horror-comedy; it's not funny nor was it meant to be.  So if u want a horror-comedy see Evil Dead or Dead Alive.  But anyhow, this is a great horror movie.  It's not a stupid teen slasher movie like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer.  The premise is very different than most movies, and the fact that the murders are being commited by an invisible force make them much more shocking than if some Jason or Micheal Myers is doing them.  That being said, the death scenes are some of the best that I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot) while there actually isn't that much blood, the deaths are all inventive and different and will stay with you for a long time to come.  I have seen Final Destination 2, and the events of that one tie closely in to this one, and it also explains what happens at the ending.  There is a great deal more of blood in the second one also.  So if you are looking for a different horror movie, or just enjoy inventive deaths, than be sure to pick this one up, and then see the second one in the theaters.

B000084T18|5.0|In my opinion, 50's debut album does live up to the hype, thanks to the superb production from Eminem and Dre, and solid rhyming skills displayed by 50. In my opinion, the strongest tracks are &quot;Don't Push Me&quot;, &quot;Back Down&quot;, and the 1st single that everyone has heard, &quot;In Da Club&quot;. This is just the beginning for 50 Cent on Eminem's label, and like future releases, this one is definitely worth the money!
B000077VT7|3.0|Those who read the Ludlum novel may feel this presentation is vaguely faithful.  There is some question if Matt Damon is the right Bourne for this movie? Certainly the movie in which Richard Chamberlain played Bourne is in some ways more like what Ludlum wrote.  Those familiar with Ludlum and what his novels try to communicate in themes relating to democracy and clandestine operations is not present in this movie.  In short not enough love went into the making of this video and for that reason it is difficult to figure out what if any point it makes? There is plenty of action and that is the sole merit of this Ludlum movie.
B000002TQV|5.0|I put on this cd and it transports me to another world. These songs are great, I don't think there is a bad one in the batch. I like \\"You Do It To Yourself.\\" Wow! What a song. The opening song \\"Planet Telev\\" rocks out and is swirly and strange. The song \\"My Iron Lung\\" is just brilliant. We play that one a lot. Put this CD on and transport yourself to another universe. Completetly!!!
B00003CXXS|3.0|What made Jurassic Park 1 a big hit was its brilliant presentation of the author's ideas on genetic engineering, chaos theory, fascination for dinosaurs and use of CG generated scenes that amazed Jurassic Park fans around the world.<br />Sadly the Jurassic Park 3 lacked all of the above. The storyline was cheesy at best. Dr. Grant accompanying a couple on a flyby over Isla Sorna which later turns out to be a rescue mission for their lost son. Improved graphics, new dinosaurs and more action. But that's basically it.<br />But the movie is still fun to watch. It's fast paced with lot of great action scenes. Suspense wasn't lacking and the special effects as usual were top notch. It's a fun roller coaster ride with all the thrills and stuff. But then that's basically just it: a roller coster ride.
B000001ZSE|5.0|If you like Jarre music, this is the album for you.  Made of one of the best of his scores ever.  From the beggining to the end.  Just put the CD on, sit down, relax, close yor eyes, and let the music do the job.  If you're a newbie, you've probobly heard his music before.  You're just not aware of what's behind.  Hear it, experience it, belive it, learn it.
0140288503|5.0|I avoided reading this book for a while, because I thought it would be a depressing account of one of America's largest military and political failures since Vietnam.  <br />I was wrong.<br />This book was incredible from page one.  Bowden's prose is riveting, even when describing the political conditions which precipitated the events in Mogadishu.  I could not put it down; the drama that unfolded on those pages was incredible, from the first signs that things were going badly, to the final run to the soccer stadium and salvation.  The chaos that took place--in spite of high-tech command and control--was conveyed with riveting detail.<br />What I got from this book was a sense of pride in the men who were in the air and on the ground and a real understanding of why soldiers despise politicians.  I'd seen several documentaries about the battle of Mogadishu, and knew what to expect through most of the book, but it never failed to keep my attention.  <br />Amazing.
B000084T18|5.0|This is one of those rare cds where practically every song is great. <BR> He doesn't get into as much complicated rhyme style like his produce Em but he has a great style of his own.<BR>Check out songs like In Da Club(of course), P.I.M.P, Don't Push Me. You even get 3 bonus tracks. 50 is gonna be around for a long while, even fellow artist who try to diss him know this(ya that's you Ja) So go pick up the cd you won't be dissapointed.
0792844890|3.0|This was Mel Brooks's last funny movie, really.  He had some talent to work with, and did some pretty funny stuff.<br />The Dark Helmet-Colonel Sandurz exchanges are for the most part, priceless.  You can, however, see some of the dumb jokes that plague Brooks' later stuff creeping in on this one.<br />A good screwball comedy that pokes fun at the popular sci-fi series of the time.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|About a Boy is one of those films that gets better the more times you watch it.  It's so funny you can't laugh at half the jokes because you are still chuckling from the last one.  Yet About a Boy is more than just a bunch of punch lines strung together, this film touches on some serious issues, but in a manner that never seems pretentious.<br />Will (Hugh Grant) is in his late 30's and doesn't really care about anyone or anything but himself.  Attempting to meet single mothers (although he hates kids, he thinks single mothers are desparate) he accidentally falls in with a boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).  Slowly the two begin a friendship that will be the most important relationship either has ever had.<br />I don't want to say much more than that.  This story is endlessly charming.  American Pie directors Paul and Chris Weitz have fashioned a magnificent film out of Nick Hornby's material.  And how well does Hugh Grant fill out this role?  Charming, witty, and hopelessly self-absorbed, he is fantastic as Will, the guy you know you shouldn't like, but do anyway.<BR>All the supporting players are great too.  Toni Collette is amazing as Marcus's misfit mother and few child actors come off better than Nicholas Hoult does here.  I really enjoyed this one.
0440224764|5.0|The main character, Patrick, is so smart that he outmaneuvers almost everyone...except...you have to read the book.  Hated the ending.
0780622553|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I was so blown away that I didn't catch everything. I have seen this movie probably seven or eight times since seeing it in the theater and it still leaves me feeling the same as the first time. It's almost a magical feeling.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin park is the best band in the history of mankind.  Eminem and them are my favorite band.  The DJ is hip, the singers are awesome, and the instruments rock!  I will now rate the songs. <br />SONG #1: Papercut(10/10)-This is a great song.  The rapper really does his best in this song.<br />SONG #2: One step closer (8/10)-good song, but kind of disturbs me when they scream SHUT UP WHEN IM TALKING TO YOU!!!<br />SONG #3: With You (7/10)-Cool beginning.  Rap is pretty good too.  But the rest is pretty bad.<br />SONG #4: Points of athority (9/10)-Wow!  I really like this song.  Great chorus.  I think they also have pretty good music in this one.<br />SONG #5: Crawling (10/10)-I LOVE this song.  It is easily my 2nd favorite.  I mostly like that they arent screaming through the WHOLE song.<br />SONG #6: Runaway (7/10)-Okay song.  Pretty bad words and rythim though.<br />SONG #7: By Myself (10/10-WOW!  I really didn't listen to this song much until my friend Derek showed it to me.  Now it is my fourth fav.  Great music and rap.<br />SONG #8: In The End (12/10)-This song is not only my favorite song on this CD, but my favorite song in the world!  The best song Ive ever heard.  AWESOME rap and music.<br />Song #9: Place For My Head (9/10)-I like this song.  Great rapping, but the rapping was kind of slow; and it has one of the outbursts like in number 2.<br />SONG #10: Forgotton (6/10)-I really dont like this song.  I really dont have many positive things to say about it.<br />SONG #11: Cure for the Itch (10/10)-I LOVE this song.  Mr. Hans Rocks in this one.  Pretty funny too.  How the little people are talking in the beginning.  My third Fav.<br />SONG #12: Pushing Me Away (6/10)-Pretty nice lyrics, but I really dont like it.  It would be better suited for a slow rock CD.<br />     Through and through, even the low rated ones arent too bad.  This is still, by far, the  best  music  EVER!
6302968100|5.0|This movie will absolutely blow you away. The only thing wrong is the title, It makes you think it is a chick-flick. It is a masterpiece seldom seen. If you buy no other movie this century this one is the one to buy. Alabama is superb, Clarence even Elvis has a great spot.
0151008116|5.0|No, it didn't make me believe in God--I already do, but I'm not sure it would have swayed me if I hadn't.  Still, it was an amazing read.  What an imagination Mr. Martel has!  Excellent story telling--I would recommend.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Interesting cd. Perhaps a trip to the groups web site will convinence you they are a little out there. I realy like the adventure the group takes us. It's realy tough to carry a theme through a grouping of music. (the sound is like a cross between The Beatles and King Krimson not a bad cross) For the most part the group pulls it off,
B0000062FL|5.0|out of all the works by Carlos and the Band, this is the best of the earliest works.  Just make sure you listen to this through headphones or a really great sound system to get the full impact!  If music has the power to move you, this CD will surely do that...it music is simply soaring!  There is and never will be anyone like Carlos and this shows him at his best.
B00006L3S3|2.0|Ok the re-issue.... simply save your cash get the first release.
B00005A0RI|5.0|I had the pleasure of hearing Haden and tremedous sidemen (hah, each sideman is a leader on their own)at the Cleveland Museum of Art, in a concert played, as Hayden noted from the stage, entirely without amplification.  It was a wonderful moment, and I can think of very few jazz concerts that I have been to (many) that matched this for sheer musicality and understatement.  This was the first time I had seen Haden live, and I've been a fan ever since I first heard him play with Pat Matheny over 20 years ago. I hope I'll be fortunate to experience him live again.<BR>The point of this is the cd captures the live experience of the concert which I'll have the pleasure to listen to repeatedly, and you should go buy this cd immediately.
B000077VT7|3.0|Watching THE BOURNE IDENTITY brings to mind numerous previous spy films in which an agent may be a turncoat and has to be brought in from the cold.  In order for this genre to resonate the audience has to empathise with the agent so that they can feel his concern and his peril.  Car chases, explosions, and exotic locales ought to be used to further cement the relation between viewer and hero, rather than divert the former in accepting the derring-do of the latter. What director Doug Liman presents is a non-stop action thriller that tries so hard to thrill that credibility goes out the window early on.<br />Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is a surprisingly youthful amnesia victim plucked from the ocean by Italian sailors.  He has two bullets lodged in him, yet after only two weeks he is able to do heavy physical lifting.  In a nutshell, these rapidly healed bullet wounds suggest the film's major weakness: the audience is asked to take Bourne's physical presence as reason enough to overlook some pretty big holes placed there by logical slugs.  Bourne does not even know that he speaks Italian, Dutch, French, or German until he faces native speakers of those languages.  His mastery of the martial arts is closer to the fighting of THE MATRIX than to any legitimate style.  <br />There is a scene in which Bourne and a local woman (Franka Potente) are interrupted in a moment of passion by a hired assassin who battles Bourne in a manner more than suggestive of Robert Redford in a like situation from THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, complete right down to a knife sticking out of the assassin's shoe.  Further, the ongoing but futile attempts of the CIA to track what they deem as a turncoat agent seem a pale comparison to a similar hunt from DAY OF THE JACKAL.  What all these logical gaffes suggest is that to create a spy thriller a director need not do more than have a youthful and handsome hero, an equally attractive female lead, numerous hand to hand clashes, and frequent use of exoticlocale.  The directors of THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and DAY OF THE JACKAL could offer Doug Liman some useful tips on how to do just that.
B000007VCM|5.0|Reading the other reviews, it sounds as though we're preaching to the converted. Anyhow, this album stands as one of my all-time faves and would definitely make it into my top 5 to bring along with me onto a desert island (provided that island had a CD player and some power source; hmmm, maybe I'd just bring along a satellite phone instead)
0743201140|5.0|On its own, &quot;Now, Discover Your Strengths&quot; is a very interesting read for anyone in a leadership position, but paired with its prequel, &quot;First, Break All the Rules,&quot; one can be armed with a self-awareness and understanding of others to create paradigm shifts in nearly any organization.  As an educator, I recognized immediately the implications of exploring the thirty-four talents outlined in this text for all levels of an educational organization.  Teachers would do well to read this book to help bridge students' natural talents with curricular knowledge and skills (multiple intelligences), building-level administrators would do well to tap into various staff members' talents in order to develop and manage a school culture where each staff member is valued and, therefore, serves with a common goal of helping students reach their full potential.  Central office administrators would do equally well to understand the talents outlined in this text as they go through their recruiting and hiring routines.  Working from the text's premise that it is best to develop people's talents into strengths instead of trying to 'fix' weaknesses, evaluation and professional development practices in schools have the potential to be dramatically improved.  Overall, this book, either alone or with its predecessor, would be a valuable read for any aspiring or practicing instructional leader.
B000084T18|5.0|Everyone go out and buy this CD. This is a must have in your music collection. This has hot lyrics and beats to rock ya trunk. 50 Cent is the hottest artist right now and you gotta get his album.
B00005U8EM|5.0|It's the chance we'd all like and never get. Finally, an opportunity to do it all again and not screw up. And so in \\"Groundhog Day\\" Phil Connor (Bill Murray) gets the chance--and blows it. Then gets it again, and blows it again. And on we all go on a wild excursion from delightful comedy to the darkest recesses of the human soul. Sure it's been done. Scrooge took an equally dark ride though his past in an attempt to reclaim his soul; and George Bailey was given the opportunity to view the world without him. \\"Groundhog Day\\" isn't better, but it's damned good. What's more, Scrooge was s-o-o-o very evil, and George Bailey was s-o-o-o very good. Phil Connor is Everyman. <br />It takes him many mornings of waking up to \\"I Got You, Babe\\" to learn life: The rest of us get that one morning only. We better not blow it.

B00006YXEK|5.0|This is by far the best album since All Things Must Pass. Any Road and Stuck Inside a Cloud are great songs... The delux package is cool... The poster is very nice as well as the pick. The picture of George on one side and the OM sign on the other... The Guitar Pick is something that I will hold dear to me... The DVD could have been longer. But it still manages to tug the heartstrings...<br />You get to see George working it out in the studio. The man did not even let on that he was as sick as he was. He even told people what the recording business is really about. \\"Real people playing real instruments straight on to tape.\\"<br />His son.. I about cried when I laid eyes on him... He looks like his father... What he and Jeff Lynn did was super... They both felt that the music should be heard, and the people are listening. I think George would be very proud of his last effort.<br />Aside from what shortcomings that some people may find, I think that Jeff and Dhani did George justice on this, his final album. RIP George... You did great on this one....
B00000IQC8|5.0|Yes it's true; Clerks is black and white, has no real movie stars--just casted with old high-school and college buddies, and was made on only a $27,000 budget. Most people would think that with that kind of start--a good movie would be impossible to make. Not for Kevin Smith...<br />Clerks follows a day in the lives of two overworked counter jockies who hate their jobs more than anything. The convenient store worker, Dante, is on his day off and is planning on sleeping in and playing hockey in the afternoon. Early in the morning, the boss calls him and tells him that the other guy is sick and cant come in. Dante agrees to work as long as the boss shows up at noon to take over. From there the day only gets worse for Dante and his best friend and video store worker, Randal. During the course of the day they manage to [upset] almost every costumer, learn things about their sex lives, play hockey on the roof, and even attend a wake (which the scene ends in one of the funniest ways).<br />This movie made Kevin Smith a huge star. All it took was the hilarious Clerks to start him off and by the next year, he had already made another movie with stars like Jason Lee and Ben Affleck. And from there made movies with even more stars like Joey-Lauren Adams, Matt Damon, Shannon Elizabeth, and still keeps his old \\"Clerks\\" buddies like Brian O'Halleran and Jeff Anderson, and of course Jason Mewes. <br />Clerks is definatly one of the funniest movies ever and IS the funniest Kevin Smith movie out of the New Jersey series. Watch out for \\"Jay and Silent Bob's\\" first movie appearance which was followed by roles in Kevin Smith's other movies and even their own movie. This is Kevin Smith at his best.<br />\\"Clerks\\" runs for about 95 minutes. It is rated R for extremely explicit sexual dialogue and for strong language. It originally was rated NC-17. Not reccomended for anyone under 17.
B000089CKH|5.0|A band probably more popular for other things.  About 6 years ago this band came out with a talking song called &quot;popular&quot; that made them popular among the MTv generation.  I went an saw them at a now defunct club called &quot;Club Babyhead&quot; in Providence, RI and they were awesome.  I will never forget them ending there set and the club owner coming over to thank them for not playing &quot;Popular&quot;.  I was so distraught and I could see it on their faces.  This band has talent and they have songs to back it up.  All of there albums are great works, but this one is the one that took the most emotional energy to write.  You simply will get drawn in from the 1st cut &quot;Blizzard in 77&quot;.  I cannot stop listening to the 5th song entitled &quot;blonde on blonde&quot;.  and the second to last song on the album is amazing; &quot;Treading Water&quot;.  Imagine the sounds of Coldplay, Oasis (when they were good), and Luna, and you will have a fair idea of what makes there sound.  I have a feeling all three of these songs probably won't be released, but they will be played in my house and hopefully yours' soon.
0694526088|4.0|Love this book.  Its message is fairly straightforward and makes sense.  Many have said that it's perhaps too simplistic, but if it were so easy to implement these strategies, more companies would be best in class.<br />My only complaint, the author is absolutely annoying on the Audio CD.  Great exaggeration, overemphasis on every topic.  He sounds like a bad actor who is trying too hard.  The unfortunate part is that the author is narrating the Audio CD, not someone else.  He comes across a bit to self-absorbed and proud of himself, as if he discovered the Holy Grail.  There is nothing wrong with being passionate about your work, but this guy needs to relax.  <br />He also needs a speech coach.  Since when is Nazi pronounced \\"nasi\\"?  Buy the book and be forewarned that the Audio Book will have you hating this guy by the end and you'll forget his message.
B000000WZ4|3.0|Depeche Mode jumped the shark with this album.  Dave Gahan's vocals sound strained in many of the songs, and the beats are The Orb/One-Inch Punch/Tricky electronica.  DM was a trendsetter in 80's synth-pop, but with &quot;Ultra&quot; they're chasing the crowd.  The overall sound is bluesier, more organic and loungy than that of prior albums.  Con: the energy level is way down.  Alan Wilder's presence is missed.  Did he foresee something the other three didn't?  <br />&quot;Barrel of A Gun&quot; is a decent edgy-funk opener, but has none of the urgency of earlier songs like &quot;Something to Do&quot; or &quot;Never Let Me Down Again.&quot;  Other tracks like &quot;The Love Thieves&quot; and &quot;Freestate&quot; have a mellowed-out style that probably took root when DM wrote &quot;Condemnation&quot; for their previous album.  (I'm too lazy right now to type &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion.&quot;)<BR>&quot;Uselink,&quot; &quot;Jazz Thieves&quot; and &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; are blatant filler.  The hidden track (#12) is more filler.  Put outtakes in an anthology; don't use 'em to beef up a weak album.<br />OK, I'm not gonna be a total jerk.  &quot;Home&quot; has good orchestration and Martin Gore has never sounded better.  He's always been a better singer than Gahan, anyway.  &quot;Sister of Night&quot; stands out for its energy and the catchiest chorus of the whole CD. <br />I can't say that I've &quot;outgrown&quot; DM's music, because their style HAS definitely changed/evolved since &quot;Violator.&quot;  So, I'll say that DM outgrew me.  &quot;Ultra&quot; is a logical step in the progression from &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; to the unnecessary &quot;Exciter.&quot;
0425173895|5.0|Having to read this book for my Crime Stories class at my college, I knew that I should read it before it was assigned so as to actually enjoy it and not have the classic case of \\"assigned-book-equals-boring-book\\"-syndrome that too many students have to suffer.  I read it about two weeks before it was assigned, and finished it today.  Oh my god, that was amazing!<br />Written in a complex (not to mention dated) style, this book is narrated by one James Sheppard, a small-town doctor in Victorian England.  He introduces us to the town and its characters (which, I might add, there are a LOT of), and the whole mystery itself.  It also features the super detective Hercule Poirot, in his fourth adventure (yes, this is part of a series...fortunately it doesn't seem to involve any of the other books except through vague mentions).<br />As to the mystery, I won't get too into it, it involves the suicide and possible blackmail of a woman, a wealthy man's murder, and...okay, just read it and find out for yourself.  It's just so interesting; it's a quick read, and once you put this book down...just...I can't begin to describe it.  Let's just say that I could not believe how everything turned out in the end.  Read it, and I hope you enjoy it as much.
B000063147|5.0|This cd is a7f's First CD and it is simply Amazing. I found a copy of this in a local CD store ... Take a little old school metal (Iron Maiden) Mix it with some HardCore and add in a lot of Megadeth Styles and you get A7f's. I was never big into the \\"scream core \\" scene till I heard this cd. They are Even better live! The one song on there that catches your attention the most has to be Warmness on the Soul. The most ordinary Piano Love Ballad ever, but from a band that produces some heavy Sounds, it's quite astonishing! Check this cd out, you won't regret it. Also Check out Atreyu \\"Butterfly kisses and Suicide Notes\\"
B00006RIO7|1.0|The movie will never compare to the original Broadway show and the Revival Broadway show but it is bareable to watch.  Actually it's better than nothing. But to get the sound tract album is a waste of money. Your ears will not like the voices of the 3 main characters and then,why should they...Hollywood almost had it right. If you look at all the other musical movies over the ages they casted people that had musical talent...If you want a great cast recording of \\"Chicago\\" get the Broadway or Broadway Revival version. It's alot better on the ears. And what is the Rap thing at the end?  Have they lost their minds? Where do they get this stuff from?...Plus it has NOTHING to do with the musical show \\"Chicago\\" and is a terrible insult to the original composers...
B00005JL0I|4.0|If one has only seen the traditional James Bond movies, this film may come as a shocker.  Yet it is surprisingly accurate (for a parody) when compared to the book of the same name-- especially in the card game scene.  It pokes fun at the Bond movies of the '60s in addition to '60s pop culture (i.e. the opening scene with \\"Les Beatles\\" on a lamppost).  Casino Royale is a refreshing delight with an All-Star cast!!!
B000022TSF|5.0|I had the pleasure of watching this film one shot at a time during the Virginia Film Festival.  It was a 3-part lecture series with Roger Ebert in the audience to lead discussions and answer some of our questions.   It was a great way to watch this particular film -- in the dark with a room full of strangers yelling \\"stop\\" every time something interesting pops up.  Nearly every frame of this movie would work as a photograph worthy of hanging in your living room.  Aside from this movie's unforgettable visual elements (and some of those frames we stopped on are now ingrained in my brain), Chinatown has one of the most compelling and original plotlines of any serious drama I've ever seen.  Too bad the dramatic climax has been parodied so much in the last couple decades...<br />Anyhoo, if you liked this, you should probably check out Polanski's new one, \\"The Pianist.\\"  If theres one thing this man knows it's trauma.  Polanski reminds us that life ain't always a walk in the park...
B00000DC10|5.0|There are bands that are good and then there are bands that are great. Refused is one of the greats.  This was released in 1998 and still feels fresh and innovative and will for years to come. This picks up where the Refused last cd \\"The songs to fan the flames of discontent\\" left off, on that release they were combining rock and roll guitar riffs into metal/harcore with overtly punk lyrics. \\"The shape of punk to come\\" continues this style adding and expanding to even more genres of music. Electronics and techno-ish beats pulsating through and in between the songs and even a stand up bass in the \\"deadly rythm\\". This isn't where the genius ends the lyrics are orginal and informative, the vocals are insane ranging from soulful mod rock singing to screaming in a great way that isn't awful like thrice, and the last and least important thing is the refused had style. There fashion sense was amazing. Great haircuts too. If you're just getting into hardcore or looking for something fresh you should own this record. It could change everything.
0151008116|3.0|I don't know that I saw such symbolism in this story as other online reviewers here saw. I felt for one that that Pi's religious leaning never materialized much in the main meat of the story, when he was lost at sea. I was expecting more of an enlightenment to come during his time with Richard Parker, instead it remained to me a basic castaway story, with the routine \\"Oh God, why have you done this to me\\"'s scattered about. And the ending was the oddest I think I have ever read, making me wonder which was the real story? Could the truth have been the tale of murder and brutality that he told the investigators in the end, when they found his tale of being abandoned in a lifeboat with a tiger too farfetched? Could the main story of the book been all mere symbolism for horrors that Pi could not face and understand? I think the heart of the story was really a wonderful tale, but to me there were parts that seemed mismatched and disjointed.
0553103547|5.0|...Is that this is the funniest fantasy series out there (that I've read anyway). I think one of the downfalls of this genre is its sense of self-importance. This is absent from ASoI&F. And while it has a clever sense for the absurd, it never declines into parody. These books deal with adult topics (sex, violence, etc) in ways that are not romanticized like they usually are in this genre.<br />For example, a couple of the main characters are disabled, and it is dealt with in such an honest fashion (they have unique strengths apart from their disabilities), I really appreciated it. It seems that in so many fantasy epics everyone is beautiful, strong, intelligent, or they're pure evil and/or dead.<br />While I don't think this series is necessarily the best example of fantasy (LotR of course), I do think it is the best example of a fantasy that has something new to say. Robert Jordan tried to say something new in this genre, and by the 5th book, totally lost control of it. Hopefully that won't happen to this series.
B000021XS0|5.0|This album is one of my favorite albums of all time.  It was the first thing I ever heard of Dream Theater and as a result I now have a DVD of their concert along with five of their albums, plus both Liquid Tension Experiment albums, which if you've never heard of, I suggest you look up.  I love the whole storyline setup and the music is just unbelievable!  I'm on my second copy of this album because my first got played so much that my stereo wouldn't even read it any more.  I'm a college man, and half of the people I've met have approached me because of how loud I crank up my stereo when I put this album in. Petrucci is my favorite guitarist ever, and his riffs and solos on this album are the best!  I could go on forever, but you just have to hear it for yourself, so stop reading this and go get this album!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Who would expect Chris Cornell to join the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine?  Well they have done it, they have formed a band like no other, forming their own sense of soul into the music.  The music will leave you breathless, the lyrics make you realize about life as one would have never defined it.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|What a pleasant surprise!  I had skipped both the book and the movie last summer, but picked up the DVD on a whim.  Hugh Grant (the initial attraction for me) does a terrific job portraying a single man who seems as if he's trying to convince himself that he is happy with his lonely and disconnected existence. He reluctantly becomes involved as a father figure to a 12-year-old misfit of a boy, and discovers that he has a knack for helping this kid through some troubled times (at school and at home).  Even my husband, who frowned when I didn't return from the video store with &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, confessed that he really enjoyed this movie.  I think he (and a lot of other men) can relate to the main character's feeling that he was an &quot;island&quot; but is now part of an &quot;island chain&quot;. :)
B000067DNC|5.0|In my opinion the Stargate SG-1 series is in a class of its own with very few flaws. I have Seasons 1 and 2 and I am curiously waiting for season 3. I am one that puts himself in a movie when it's worth it and let me tell you I had a few wet towels. I am glad to see Dean instead of Kurt as lead roll because of the humor differances between the two actors. I too would like to see a movie or two come out of this in the future but please no spinoffs unless they are as good or better. This is one series worth seeing over and over and you will pick you favorates as I had. You will enjoy !!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Holly Cole and Norah Jones sound very similar in voice, with Holly picking up a much more voluptuous and mature bottom end. However, the rhythym, textures, and timbre are so similar, I wouldn't be surprised if they work together or have the same musicians. Listen to some of the Holly Cole samples if you are a Norah Jones fan, you may enjoy them.<br />Wes Y. Keller<BR>Round Rock, TX
B000066NW0|4.0|My expectations for this CD were higher than the product I actually got. I was hoping for more punk hits like Sk8r Boi.. but no.. they were all softies. Don't get me wrong, I love the CD, but I was hoping that she wouldn't totally sell herself out and make songs that people want to hear every 2 seconds on the radio. I guess for a debut album songs have to be like that. So for the next album, I'm hoping for hardcore punk.<br />For everyone who says she's just like Britney.. she's not. Sure, she may keep her hair and makeup under check, but she's not all about showing off her bod and proving to the world how not-innocent she is. She's just.. Avril. And for that.. she rocks my world!
B00005LW7R|5.0|This an effervescent recording of what is, in my opinion, Verdi's greatest opera. The BPO play with terrific elan and virtuosity (as you'd expect). Abbado conducts the performance with all the experience he's gained over many years. It shows. The extraordinary second scene of Act II (where Falstaff gets dumped into the Thames) is very successful, the line of the drama never being allowed to slacken. All the singers sound involved in the performance, much as they would if it had been recorded live.  <BR>When listening to this recording you can only be amazed, again and again, at the incredible fecundity of Verdi's musical imagination. As a comic opera, Falstaff only has an equal in the three Da Ponte operas of Mozart. No one else, other than Mozart and Verdi in Falstaff, came close to creating a fluid musical texture that could respond to every comic nuance of a libretto. Certainly not Rossini, good as he is. What a miraculous achievement this score is. 10 out of 10 for the recording too for bringing it to life
B00003CWL6|1.0|This movie is quite simply awful. The plot is unbelivable and the movie is filled with scenes that are just asking for some nouveau artsy fartsy type to find symbolism where it doesn't exist. This movie had nothing to say to me, I got no meaning from it. I found some humor in Lester's actions, but I much prefer the attitude and antics of Peter in Office Space to Lester in american beauty. At least Peter was deep down a good person and balances his revelation with reality in the end. People that enjoyed it seemed to come away thinking it was wonderful, but not really being able to explain why. I came away from the movie thinking that the adult characters are all self absorbed and disgusting and the younger characters are naive, much like the reviewers who gave it a positive review, but feel free to keep looking closer until you find some meaning to this movie. I've seen it several times and still come away feeling disgusted and irritated with it.
B000085RTR|5.0|...because this is the best album of the year. I just received my copy of the limited edition in the mail today, and my day halted to a stop. I could not wait to listen! <BR>First, the packaging is gorgeous. Of course, it's a digipak and the cover artwork is some of the best album art to come out in recent history--in the leagues of Dream Theater's album \\"Scenes from A Memory\\", \\"Snow\\" by Spock's Beard, or \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" by Emerson Lake & Palmer. The digipak has a glossy sheen to it and folds out nicely, containing a temporary tatoo inside with the new Kamelot logo. Liner notes are also unattached to the digipak and are quite complete in detail.<BR>Pop the disc in your stereo and you have an awesome new power-progressive rock concept album; pop it in your PC and you have an amazing Quicktime-driven multimedia experience. I won't spoil that, though. Just take my word for it and put it in your CD-ROM drive.<BR>Now let's get to the meat: the music of the album. The production quality of this work is mind-blowing. For such an underground band (in comparison to Britney, Avril, NSYNC, or Mariah, etc.), the overall sound puts theirs to shame. The highs are crisp and the thumps of Casey Grillo's double-bass work give you a nice kick (no pun intended) without bottoming out your system. This album has more keyboard involvement than heard with Kamelot before, making for nice techno-esque phasing sounds and panning, a la Front Line Assembly or Chemical Brothers (we're talking sound quality here, not musical quality). Khan's voice soars on this album, with reverb and majesty we haven't heard before in a Kamelot recording. Whereas his voice would sometimes become muddled and lost in verses, now it mixes perfectly with all other elements. The songs are heavy but still orchestral and epic in nature, making you wish even songs that last six minutes would never stop. The grooves are \\"headbangable\\", if you will, but don't overtake the album, willing to step aside to gorgeous female vocal passages, symphonic themes, or Gregorian Chants. <BR>Each band member is at their finest in this effort, most of all, Thom Youngblood, on guitars, who has always been impressive as a guitarist, but I think has finally begun to define himself and his style on this record--especially his songwriting ability. <BR>Anyway, before I bore you to death, let me say I can't sing enough praise of this album, and if you're a fan of Dream Theater, Symphony X, Spock's Beard, Transatlantic, Stratovarius, ARK, Iced Earth, or just any sort of metal but are open-minded to more diverse elements, give this one a shot.<BR>I picked up Kamelot's previous album, \\"Karma\\", in September of 2001, just on a whim, without hearing them much previously, and am now a heavily devoted fan. This band WILL grow on you, if you let them.<BR>Epica is set to be 2003's album of the year. It may only be February, but this reviewer will still stand by that statement in 10 months.<BR>Don't cheat yourself out of this one. I'm sure Lord Chimp, the Amazon Prog-Rock Guru, would agree.<br />(Album highlights include \\"Center of The Universe\\", \\"Edge of Paradise\\", \\"Descent of The Archangel\\", \\"Helena's Theme\\" and how it leads into \\"The Mourning After\\" and the awe-inspiring finale, \\"III Ways to Epica\\". Everything is incredible, though, not just these tracks. Thanks for reading.)
B000069I1C|3.0|This movie is funny and entertaining and doesn't take itself too seriously since it makes fun of other old tired cop movies out there, and surely pokes fun at itself. Murphy is a cop who wants to be an actor. Deniro is a detective who punches out a camera man and is forced to become part of a &quot;cops&quot; like TV show. Murphy auditions and gets the part as his partner and the two couldn't be more different. They rub each other the wrong way and while Murphy is trying to look good on the show to land a big acting job, Deniro is trying to be a typical cop. Its humorous to watch the interaction between the overacting murphy, who represents the typical police drama, and the serious Deniro who represents real cops. In one scene shatner is showing deniro and Murphy how to do some &quot;hood jumping&quot;, Murphy pulls it off like a pro and deniro remarks that hood jumping never happens in real life, but later on we find him hanging on to the hood of a car in a high speed chase.  I really like deniro and murphy together, and though murphy isn't the best actor, it doesn't really come out in the movie, because he's playing the part of a poor actor trying to act like a &quot;TV&quot; cop the whole time. The only problem I have with the movie is the ending with the camera since its not very believable. The acting is ok, the plot is interesting, but the humor and satirical irony are what kept me interested, and even if you don't &quot;get it&quot; and like simple movies, you'll enjoy and laugh at this one.
0679720200|4.0|Title says it all, the Stuart Gilbert translation is much better.  I'd give the Gilbert translation five stars.  Do you self a favor and gat that one.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Hm...so it's been a while since i saw my post here regarding this disc, and lemme tell ya, the CD keeps getting better and better with each listen! I mean, man, I'd never thought Audioslave would wound up becoming legendary listening, but it has, and now they're about to show the rest of the world what they're made of with an upcoming tour, and yes,  a Lolapalooza slot. Kinda weird since Chris Cornell's Soundgarden was one of the last bands to played Lolapalooza in the 20th century, and now he's back with his new band in the show for the 21st century. Well, enough of the rants, now it's time to tell you what each track on  the CD has been for me since i bought it last year:<br />1. Cochise: Despite the title not being mentioned in the song ( or for that matter, an explanation in the song as who or what it is), the song still stuns me everytime i listen to it. Plus, i've heard one of their demos for this one, and even then it was hot!<br />2. Show me how to live: Perhaps the most spiritual song on the CD after \\"Light my way\\", it stands as a great rocker even without the lyrics.<br />3. Gasoline: Perhaps the band's favorite song from themselves, this one always gets stuck in my head because of the guitar solo.<br />4. What you are: perfect anger-release song. That's the best way i can describe this one.<br />5. Like a stone: The second single is also perhaps one of the simplest songs Tom Morello has ever done..at least it sounds that way. Great tune.<br />6. Set it off: How do you set this sucker off? By playing it loud and heavy!!<br />7. Shadow of the sun: Nice change of vocals here by Cornell and yet another use of the sun in one of his songs.<br />8. I am the highway: Easily the best ballad on the album. I love to sing along with this one ( heck, all of them too) while strumming to my acoustic guitar.<br />9. Exploder: For some reason, the first thought that came into my mind when i read the title of the song was \\"hmm, they named a song after a pro wrestling movefrom Japan?\\". Stupid, i know. Nevertheless, the    song itself is worthy of rock pantheon, with the simple (and catchy) rhythm that's played by Commerford, Morello and skatted by Cornell staying in your head all throughout the song.<br />10. Hypnotize: Techno-garden? \\"this is not raging against the machine!\\". That's what a lot of people have htought of this number. Me, i'm impressed by Wilk's drumming ability ( reminiscent of rage's cover of \\" Renegades of Funk\\") and  Morello's brilliant guitar here.<br />11. Bring 'em back alive: Maybe it should be called the virus song. Nevertheless, the vocal effects and the lyrics finished this tune off nicely along with the guitar.<br />12. Light my way: This prayer set on \\"electrifying\\" features incredible guitar sound.  Heck, i think this is the best spiritual  song that's released by a secular band lately.<br />13. Getaway car: and i thought no one could write a song from the POV of a car. But here it is, with great introspective lyrics to go with it.<br />14. The Last Remaining Light: Just like Troy Percival of the Angels, this song closes the album hard. Great pace and an amazing details in the lyrics of the song. Cornell can still take his voice up to the heavens at his ripe age.<br />      There you go...if you havent been enslaved yet by Audioslave, by all means, please buy it. It does, indeed, get better with time.
B00006RIO7|5.0|My only complaint is that the prologue to &quot;Roxie&quot; that Renee Zellweger does in the movie is not included on the soundtrack. I thought it was very effective and moving (and funny) and would have LOVED to have seen it included on the album. Oh well, can't have everything I suppose.
B00007KQA3|5.0|I have seen this film on VHS and it is perfect in every way. Not only is Hurt stellar in his portrayal of Winston Smith, but Richard Burton gives his final hurrah as the Minister of Love in George Orwell's classic. The Eurythmics add to the mix with the great title track of \\"sex crime\\" which is one of their best singles.<br />When the VHS stopped being distributed, I was devastated. You could not find this flick except at rental stores. I tried several times to find sellers of the VHS on the web with no success. Now that this forgotten movie has come out on DVD, I am in heaven. The cinematography, the acting, the whole feel of the movie are a spot on match for Orwell's dark novel of a dysfunctional future.<br /><br />Complaining that this movie is too dark and depressing misses the point.  \\"1984\\" is not a happy novel.  I remember seeing an animated production of  \\"Animal Farm\\" made in 1950's that ruined that novel's intent by putting in a \\"happy\\" end.  Film is more than mere \\"entertainment\\" when it is done correctly film can illuminate the human condition or give us pause for thought.  While the bard wrote numerous comedies, (the popcorn movies of his time) he also wrote some of the greatest tragedies of western literature. A more recent example was the film \\"Gattaca\\" its' bittersweet ending made it a standout film.  It did not try to \\"entertain\\" but it was still great cinema.<br />This movie is almost the exact opposite of the typical Hollywood movie, especially the over-hyped action-fests that are par for the course these days. While \\"MI 2\\" and its' ilk are good popcorn movies a steady diet of popcorn will leave you malnourished. This film will fill your MDR of thoughtfulness and gravis for at least the next six months. Even if this movie is nothing more than a transfer of the VHS to DVD I would still recommend it. I'm buying this DVD sight unseen, which is something I rarely do. Few movies deserve to get the DVD treatment. That dreck like \\"Battlefield Earth\\" or \\"Barbwire\\" got shipped out on DVD while \\"1984\\" laid in cinematic limbo is proof positive that Hollywood has its' priorities screwed up.Barbwire\\" got shipped out on DVD while \\"1984\\" laid in cinematic limbo is proof positive that Hollywood has its' priorities screwed up.
B000001EAQ|5.0|At the end of a decade of experimenting with dance and techno, U2 put out their most heavily techno-influenced album to date.  Recieving what I understand to be mixed reviews, this album has grown to be one of my current favorite records.  <BR>  From the intense dance opener, to great techno tracks like MoFo, to more serious songs like Staring at the Sun, this album proves that U2 can succeed in making wonderful music of all different kinds.<BR>  The pace of the album is perfectly balanced as well, like all U2 albums, balancing the mix of slower serious songs, and techno/rock tracks like the first three.<BR>  Like Achtung Baby and Zooropa before it, Pop brings U2 fans a great rock and roll record, regardless of whether or not it sounds like their work from the 1980's, and I admire bands who are not afrain to experiment with their sound like that, especially bands as huge as U2 were at the time they began to experiment wiht their sound.  It was a risk that was well worth taking.
B00006CXXU|5.0|There are so many things to say about this CD! I couldn't believe how well Christina did on this! A lot of the songs on it were very close to home with me and gave me some inspiration! All I can say is that this has to be the best music investment i made in a long time!
0201485672|2.0|The book attempts to match the Gang of Four book in both format and effect. Unfortunately, it fails. The author spends so many pages explaining trivial refactorings such as renaming a method or introducing a constant. Any software developer with moderate experience would now how and why to perform such tasks without any need for such a book. The book doesn't cover more complex or exotic refactorings that are of greater value to the experienced developer, and it doesn't touch upon the impact that refactoring might introduce into existing code and how to manage and minimize that impact.<br />However, it does contain some useful tips on correcting some classic design mistakes using refactoring, which might prove valuable to the novice. Thus, the two-star rating.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Well what can I say about this movies, nothing but great and lots of persons already have to say something about them.

B000088E6M|5.0|First off, I have to say that 50's come a long way from the bottom strate to the top.  His albums in the past have been hott, but this is most definately his shining moment.  This album was tite from begining to end.  Every track shines in it's own respects.  Especially on the dark type beats on tracks such as 'Patiently Waiting', 'Don't Push Me' and 'Back Down'(MADD heat spit in Ja's direction...I wonder how this is going to pan out????).  The production was amazing on this album..the beats were DEFINATELY one of the reasons this album is so good.  And of course the obvious reason, 50's lyrics are on point and definately something a lot of people can relate to.  Something else I noticed was when I listened to the album, I was feelin it.  Than watched the DVD, listened to the CD again and understand every last lyric he spit.  As an artist myself, I have madd respect for 50.  His style's unique and they way he flips his words n syllables is off the chains.  Go cop this...for real. This is definately somethin I'd suggest EVERYONE go buy.  You WILL not regret it.
0345347951|5.0|I borrowed &quot;Childhood's End&quot; from a friend and didn't expect very much.  I'm no fan of Sci Fi most of the time (which more often than not seems to veer dangerously into Star Trek-ish geekery), but my friend reassured me that much more was going on here; namely, real humanity and spirituality of a sort.  Despite what I've seen in other reviews of the book, I didn't feel at all cheated at the end - in fact, I felt a sense of peace and wonder:  could it really be this way?  If so, I'm all for it!  Well worth checking out.

0425166805|4.0|The part that you mention is exactly what I was wanting to review.  Interestly enough, I seem to remember that the TV movie told about signs of the coming of the Anti-Christ, namely that 10 european powers would come together to use one monetary unit and that the the Anti-Christ would be the son of a an ex-President of the U.S. and would also run for the office.  Does anyone else remember that?
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of the strangest and most undescribable movies I have ever seen. All the characters in this story are tragic and complex. The performances are all top notch. The story is very lush and you are easily lost and caught up in it. The cinematography is beautiful. The music well bound to the scenes that are shown. I highly recommend that you see this movie. Its definitely a thinker and you'll be compelled to rewatch the movie right after you finish watching it for the first time.
0688152023|3.0|I find this a great reference for working out, especially with the NYC Ballet workout on DVD.<br />My biggest complaint is that it's designed more like a &quot;coffee-table book&quot; than an exercise manual. A spiral binding would have made all the difference, as the pages would be able to lie flat. I *do* enjoy the commentary at the beginning, and the photography is simply luscious.<br />Because the book doesn't lie open on it's own, I have a little trouble following the whole &quot;long&quot; routine directly from the book. However, the shorter routines in the back are easier to do, as I can usually remember all the movements (or only need to reference one or two).<br />I read a suggestion, somewhere, that you make an audio recording of each movement (reading out the text description) and the number of reps counted out, and then play it back while working out. This would be instead of fumbling with the book. I'm working on doing that, myself, and I hope it will aid me in doing the whole long routine.<br />I think the pictures in this book are clear and detailed enough to even teach someone who doesn't have a ballet background &quot;how&quot; to do the movements, but, I coudn't say that for sure, as I had 8 years of lessons.<br />Gwen

B00005B36H|5.0|What is so fantastic about Tool, particularly in this album, is that when you listen to their music and their words, you aren't thinking, &quot;wow, this band's pretty good.&quot;  Instead, you're feeling their words and the emotions they express in their music as if they were your own.  You begin to contemplate, what does a grudge do to you?  What happens between supposed lovers?  What would have happened if you had taken the easy path?  What will bewilder you?  The heavy, dark, and deeply beautiful music expresses so much emotion, it is almost overwhelming to the listener; the words are so provocative and touching, and sung so well, that the whole thing melts into a superfluous part of the listener's being.  Before i become much more sappy, i'm going to tell you right now, get this album, get Aenima, get Undertow, and get Opiate, in that order.  Tool's music opens up a new space for thought and contemplation that you never thought could be possible in music.  You don't know what you're missing.
B00005AQGH|5.0|In November of 1996, just two months after the tragic murder of rapper/actor/poet Tupac Shakur, possibly his best piece of work was released.  Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (released under the alias 'Makaveli Tha Don') has been universally praised as one of the greatest albums of all time, of all genres.<BR>Dark, gritty, mysterious, and intriguing - 'DK7' (as it is known) transformed rap's hottest superstar into an urban legend.  The album is said to contain countless 'clues' and insights into 2Pac's murder, which has led many to believe that 2Pac faked his death and will be returning in 2003 (7 days = 7 years).<BR>In addition to popular hit singles \\"Toss It Up\\", \\"Hail Mary\\", and \\"To Live And Die In LA\\", 'DK7' also contains gems such as \\"Blasphemy\\", \\"Hold Ya Head\\", and the often-sampled \\"Me & My Girlfriend\\".  This is one of those albums you can listen to all the way through without skipping a single track.<BR>Having since gone Quintuple-Platinum (5 million units sold), 'DK7' is a must-have record for any serious music fan.  With all of the hype surrounding this release (and the subsequent claims that have been made in the past 7 years), if 2Pac doesn't return in 2003, then we've only BEGUN to unravel the mystery of the 7 Day Theory...
B00005JL96|5.0|Disney's Lilo &amp; Stitch, is a fun action-comedy, with a tuch<BR>of romance and Si-fi-adventure... And best of all, it's something<BR>the whole family can enjoy!<br />The story fallows:<BR>In a place far, far away, illegal genetic experiment #626 is detected: Ruthless scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba has created a strong, intelligent, nearly indestructible and aggressive being with only one known weakness: The high density of his body makes it impossible for the experiment to swim in water. The scientist is sentenced to jail by the Grand Council of the Galactic Federation. The experiment is supposed to be transported to a prison asteroid, yet manages to escape Captain Gantu, who was supposed to deliver him there. With a stolen police cruiser (the red one), the destructive being races towards a little and already doomed planet: Earth. Stranded on Hawaii, experiment #626 can't actually do much harm: water all around, no big cities and two well-equipped representatives of the Galactic Federation already following close behind to catch him again. But Dr. Jookiba and the Earth expert Pleakley never could have guessed that earth girl Lilo adopts the experiment as dog, gives him the name Stitch and actually causes an emotional development in the little beast. Her dysfunctional family, consisting only of Lilo and her sister Nani, is about to be ripped apart by social worker Cobra Bubbles. Stitch as the new family member brings quite some action into all their lifes, and after a while, not even Pleakley and Dr. Jookiba can recognize their former target. But how shall they bring the news of failure to the Grand Councilwoman without being punished?<br />Overall I think this is a good disney movie, for anyone.
B0000640VO|1.0|If I new it was going to be subtitles and narrating I would have avoided it all together.  First 20 minutes and I just couldn't watch anymore.  The scenes were kind of dull.  I do not like foreign films and this one didn't change my opinion.  I go to a movie to relax and enjoy and let it do all the work to entertain me.  I don't want to have to squint and concentrate and rush reading so I can understand the storyline.  It just gave me a headache and I was instantly turned off.  If I want to read I will get a book.  On top of everything else the narrator's voice(male - creepy old man) sounded so dam annoying.  I thought this was going to be a charming feel good movie with a sweet girl and nice accents in some nostalgic little quaint village and interesting people who got a second chance at happiness.  Who knows, maybe when I get patience or desparate I'll give this movie a 2nd chance.
B00006LETU|5.0|When I started listening to the dvd-audio version for the first time it didn't seem that much better at first. So I put the normal cd in my cd player and switched to that one... OK... Now I hear ;-) It *is* good! Very good indeed! Too bad it's kind of a pain to switch my Toshiba player into the dvd-audio mode. But it's worth it. And the video of New Frontier as a bonus, that's so nice.<BR>Now I'm just waiting for those rare moments that I have the house to myself so I can pump up the volume and get totally immersed in the sound...<BR>When will they bring out all the Steely Dan CDs in DVD-Audio I wonder.
B00000K19E|5.0|Fishbourne was awesome.  Reeves was surprisingly awesome, too.  I really enjoyed the martial arts scene between the two of them it was really them and no standins, impressive!   Loads of action and scifi special effects.  Mind boggling.  One of my favourites. So worth buying!!!  Makes you go \\"hmmm\\".
B00005JKLZ|3.0|I found this movie to be disappointing with its story, yet I came away liking it a lot.  The earlier movie tied the past and future together in a more coherent manner.  Yet, I found myself surprisingly moved by the love story aspect.  The flower conversation that tied future to past actually made me gasp, which I'd never done before.  The future gets quite weird, and I get the feeling that something was omitted from the story which might have filled in the gaps better.<br />The best part of the movie is the music, which has echoes of Star Trek + Titanic + Enya.  I listen to the soundtrack CD over and over.  Maybe that's why I found the movie more moving than its story deserves.  The time travel sequences are terrific, and the machine itself is a worthy homage to the first movie.
B000088E6M|5.0|This has definitely got to be THE BEST album to come out this year.  By far better than any other rap CD in a while, probably since Eminem's \\"The Eminem Show\\".  Every song on here is HOT!!  Way better than any Benzino ...  And Ja Rule doesn't even compare to 50 in any way.  ...  The best song definitely has to be \\"Many Men\\". And when he rips Ja in \\"Back Down\\", very hot stuff.\\"Sings for hoes/Sounds like the cookie monster\\".  By far the best album out right now.  If you ain't got it, go and cop it RIGHT NOW!
B00005JLSC|5.0|Modern Day West Side Story with a equal impact.<BR>The best I've seen in many Years. <br />Mike Cassidy<BR>Brentwood, Md
B00005Q4CS|5.0|The only movie I've seen that was this intense was Fight Club.  Requiem made drug use unbelievably attractive, then unbearably cruel.  Not for the faint of heart.
B000066NW0|5.0|While I accept that Avril is part of the constantly churning music machine, her music does rock a favor by bringing melody and guitar crunch back into the mainstream again.  I personally find this refreshing.  Her songs vary in style a bit, but she seems to spend most of her time in alternative rock... clearly she is influenced by Alanis and Sarah Maclaclan; this is quite evident in her writing.  She has a wonderful voice and she uses it skillfully, the melodies are memorable and the choruses usually swell into climactic explosions which was a popular technique in many 80's rock bands.  Lyrically she relates to the world like any 17 year old would.<br />I believe that Avril is extremely talented and will no doubt have a very successful music career.  I hope that she manages to keep her wits about her while swirling inside the great music machine.  I recommend this album highly.
B000005RQT|2.0|I don't agree with all these people who claim that \\"In rock\\" is a masterpiece. Of course it's an album that helped developing rock music, but that is more because of the sound, or approach itself, than the actual quality in the songs. \\"Speed king\\" and \\"Bloodsucker\\" are good songs and so is parts of (the much too long) \\"Child in time\\", where Ian Gillan show us all what a beautiful and powerful voice he have. I'd spend my money on \\"Machine head\\" and \\"Fireball\\" before even considering buying this one.<br />Maybe 2 stars is a bit too little, and 2.5 stars would be more correct.
B00008438V|5.0|Finally, the big boys in hollywood have been decent enough to grace us with a re-release of one of the great teen flick's of the 80's.  Starring a young and accomplised Anthony michael Hall (The Breakfast Club) and a host of other 80's stars, the story follows two 15 year old teens who decide to make a virtual woman on their computer. However, things become more then just virtual as the woman they created becomes more then just a dream, and infact, real!<br />If your a fan of director John Hughes, then this is a DVD you simply have to own. It'll go nicely with other classics like \\"The Breakfast Club\\", \\"Sixteen Candles\\", \\"Pretty In Pink\\" and many more.<br />Oh, one more thing...I'm glad its being re-relesed for 2 reasons. 1) my VHS copy is almost worn out. 2) I wont have to pay for a over priced second hand copy.
B0000062S0|1.0|I'm having a hard time getting through this album. Not melodic at all. To me it's too noisy, too sloppy, too annoying. I guess you'll have to be a die hard Led Zeppelin fan to like this. Not at all for the average rock fan.
078610984X|4.0|Donald Spoto has done a good job on writing about Marilyn Monroe's life. Better than some other 'out to make money authors'. His approach is both sensitive and honest. He doesn't make her a joke and she would have liked that at least. And he finally stops those stupid conspiracy theories which keep on circulating regarding MM and JFK and RFK....Marilyn from reading Spoto's book, appears as fragile, sweet, intelligent young woman who was simply also battling her own demons and was complex, sensitive and self-destructive. She was her own enemy and nobody else could have killed her.
B000002L99|3.0|Of course, the real Van Halen features David Lee Roth on vocals, and Sammy Hagar can never take his place. While Roth has a rough voice full of attitude, Hagar is more of a high pitch squeaker. But \\"5150\\" is without doubt the best post Roth album from Van Halen. \\"Why can't this be love\\" is the outstanding track on this rather solid release. \\"5150\\" is not only for dedicated Van Halen fans. If you like melodic hard rock I guess this one will satisfy your needs quite well.
B00000K19E|5.0|Have you ever imagined what would happen if the noble intention of bettering society through the use of technology would be misused for vicious motives? Have you ever thought if one person could stand up against an extraordinarily powerful entity that keeps updating itself in order to be invincible? Can a lowly computer operator overcome the tendency of going complacent and convince the general society that they were living a lie and to embrace the truth, despite the certainty that they would suffer grave consequences, the likes we haven't imagined before?<br />Well, that is what The Matrix is all about.   Deep mythology. Wild Action. A group of dedicated rebels for the cause of the truth. Oh, yes. That very annoying agent guy who keeps coming back.  Watch the DVD and then save up money in order to watch the next two installments in the theaters.   The Wachowski Brothers have done a brilliant job of pushing the envelope in filmmaking.  When the next two movies eventually come out on DVD, make a note to yourself to play some banging electronica on your stereo system. :)
B0000026SF|5.0|In the early 1980's Europe won the Swedish rock championship (yes, there was such a thing!) and the prize was to record an album. I remember watching the final on TV and I was taken by this band. When they later released this self titled effort (with a different cover than this cd re-release) it was very clear that especially Joey Tempest (vocals) and John Norum (guitar) were talented. Being influenced by Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy and UFO, Europe themselves did a great job carrying the tradition.<br />This album, together with the follow up \\"Wings of tomorrow\\" are the bands best albums although none of them include their world wide hit \\"The final countdown\\". The music is both melodic and energetic with very good vocals and guitar playing. Every single song is heavy metal of top quality in a genre that hadn't experienced hair metal yet.<br />Europe went on and recorded \\"The final countdown\\" from which the title track became a huge hit. The rest of the albums' material wasn't pop metal oriented, but the record company which had got a taste of Europe's ability to earn large sums of money for them pushed the band into hair metal... John Norum (who was more heavy metal oriented) decided to quit the band and go for a solo career (later to join Dokken), while Joey Tempest struggled to write another hit in the same vein as \\"The final countdown\\".<br />After two rather mediocre albums: \\"Out of this world\\" and \\"Prisoners in paradise\\", Europe had come to an end. Joey Tempest released a solo album \\"Place to call home\\" that sounded more in the line of Tom Petty. Joey Tempest's first release is in fact a very good album and if you come across it - buy it. His follow up \\"Azalea place\\" was not so good, but still worth having. His third recently released self titled album is different (due to the production with it's more modern approach) from the two previous albums, and it takes some time to appreciate it.<br />If you think I'm qualified to give advise, I suggest you check out PrettyMaids \\"Red, hot and heavy\\" - very good!
B00005JLWN|4.0|Take a great story like 1984 and give it a small action twist without making it corny, and you'll have Equilibrium. The acting was good, the fight scenes were well coreographed and worked with the story, and the plot was intellegent. As far as its comparison with the Matrix goes although the feel of the movies are similar the stories are different, and don't be fooled into thinking this is just a martial arts flick. The martial arts while fun to watch are really a side note in this movie. I highly recommend checking it out.
B000001EUR|5.0|\\"Love at first sting\\" was Scorpions most commercial album, at least up till the time for its release. Maybe it's also their best album ever, besides \\"Animal magnetism\\" and \\"Blackout\\". The songs are very strong - catchy and melodic but still guitar driven. Klaus Maine has a good voice and Rudolf Schenker is clearly a very talented songwriter. There's just one or two tracks that don't reach the same height as the rest. So, turn up the volume and prepare yourself for a pleasant time with quality rock!
B000002UAU|5.0|The above title is sure to raise some eyebrows, and others may even conclude that I'm &quot;bashing&quot; this 1967 album.  But that simply isn't so.  Is &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; a classic?  Yes, of course.  Is it the best album by the Beatles?  I don't think so.  Here is an album that is so often equated with words like &quot;perfection&quot; and &quot;masterpiece&quot; that few even bother to examine &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; critically and in relation to the group's other releases.  In my ever-humble opinion, 1966's &quot;Revolver&quot; shows the Beatles at its absolute peak, and it's the more experimental and envelope-pushing record.  Still, there are plenty of kicks to be had on this winning release, such as the stomping title track with its background orchestra.  George Harrison gives us a welcome Eastern slant with the use of the sitar in &quot;Within You Without You,&quot; while Lennon and McCartney collaborate fully on the incredible &quot;A Day in the Life.&quot;  And though Elton John took &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot; to No. 1 in the 1970s, his version pales in comparison to the original that surfaces here.  McCartney gives us the still-glittering gem &quot;When I'm Sixty Four,&quot; while Ringo Starr lends his voice on the timeless &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends.&quot;  As with virtually all Beatles releases, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is a classic that's ageless, even if I'm slightly partial towards their other work.
B000002H6C|5.0|I have listened to Metallica for 2 years now and this is as good as it gets.I love everything Metallica (including their new material) but this is hands down the best. It starts of with Blackened a fast,long,heavy song which sets the stage for the entire album. One is one of the greatest metal songs ever and Harvester of Sorrow has a wonderfully dark feel to it.<BR>    The only downside to this album is that the recording is not exactly top-notch.<BR>   Other than that I would reccomend this to anyone with any intrest in Metal because this is whaat it should sound like.
0066214122|2.0|OK, I've read the book--it's very short and should have MORE detail and MORE plot and MORE character development--and read some of the reviews here.  What I want to add to the criticism is that there are a lot of OBVIOUS gaffes in the plot.<br />Let's take a simple example.  A guy heads to a clean-room lab where nanobugs have gotten loose.  He argues with the lab boss and leads a team out to where the bugs are.  The lab has lots of high-tech wizardry to eliminate particles from one's clothing on the way in and out of the lab.  The team finds itself outside and being chased by bugs.  What's wrong with this picture?<br />Well, I kept screaming at the book the same thing anyone who has ever watched an Intel commercial might scream:  WHERE ARE THE BUNNY SUITS?  A lab like that always has protective suits and gas masks available.  For that matter, later on they reveal that the garage (where this team headed) had a stash of of gas masks tucked in a cabinet.  Why didn't they grab the gas masks BEFORE half the team gets attacked?<br />And on and on it went.  Practically every scene had holes like that.  It really did read like a movie script, where the writer can get away with omissions like that in the interest of moving the plot along.  But Crichton's built his previous reputation by paying close attention and making sure the whole plot is consistent.<br />Sorry, this one needed at least another 100 pages of actual text (not the blank filler pages between &quot;chapters&quot; which were as short as a page or two) to make it hang together, and some real editing.  He took three years to write this?  He needed at least another three months of editing to get it right.
B000084T18|5.0|well , the cd wus uhm verry great and uh juss wanna say it is verry hip as the amerikans say and uhh juss wanna say go get this coopy cuz it is jammin as they say . lol
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched \\"Band of Brothers\\" on HBO and knew I had to have the DVD set when it came out.  I paid the list price for this without hesitation and have now seen it three times.<br />This miniseries is absolutely outstanding.  It has been meticulously researched and from what I understand, the actors who played the soldiers in Easy Company spent time with their real-life counterparts.  This really shows -- these guys are all real.  I was hooked on this series from the beginning and it is one that really is worth watching multiple times.  I find that I'm catching lots of details and dialogue that I missed the first time I watched it.  Plus, the battle sequences are so realistic, it's hard to catch everything that happens during them without going back and watching again.<br />This story is mainly told through the eyes of Captain Winters, who is brilliantly portrayed by Damian Lewis.  Other great performances include Captain Sopel by David Schwimmer (even though he is extremely unlikeable), Captain Nixon by Ron Livingston, Sergeant Lipton by Donny Wahlberg, and the actor who played Bill Guarnere (I can't remember his name, but I think the real Bill Guarnere must have been just like him).  The story follows Easy Company's exploits through their grueling training in Georgia to their D-Day jump into occupied France, their battles in France and Holland, and finally culminates in the capture of Hitler's Eagles Nest. <br />For anyone who wants to know what combat during World War II was like, I don't think they can go far wrong by watching this series.  It doesn't pull any punches in its violence, but this was war, after all.  This is a first-rate series in every sense of the word!
B00005JLRR|4.0|I saw this new star trek movie on the sunday after it came out.  I remember looking at the trailers and saying \\"Wow, this is going to be cool.\\"  The movie did not disapoint.  Of course I am a die-hard star trek fan, but I am also like movies like Lord of the Rings and Die Another Day.  I usually have about the same taste in movies as the average person and the movies I like are usually top box-office hits.  I couldn't understand why star trek nemesis was not.<BR>      <BR>I think that people are way too harsh when they consider this movie.  It was a great movie, yet everybody seems to think it was some horrible worthless movie that shouldn't have made it one the bigscreen.  I totally disagree.  You couldn't ask for more action and special effects in a star trek movie, or any movie for that matter.  I'm not an emotional person when I watch movies but I have to say, this one nearly made me cry.  <BR>    <BR>I think that this all started with some non-fan watching it and saying he didn't like it and then everybody backing him up.  Sure the story lacked a little, but the action and suspence made up for it.  I think that all you people who think that this was a terrible movie should go watch it again, and leave the critism at home.  I think you will find that this is an extremely enjoyable movie and you shouldn't be so harsh on it.
B00006AUIG|5.0|I think many people giving this movie a bad review didn't understand the concept of it. The TRUE horror of this film is what can happen to a person when things in their life start to go bad. The setting takes place in real-life abandoned insane asylum, and the director makes good use of dark corners and shadows, giving the film a VERY creepy feel. The acting is above average for an indie film and it is well scripted. The story starts out slow as you learn about each of the five main characters in the film. As the film progresses, you're given subtle clues about the life of the lead character, Gordon. There is a sub-plot that eventually ties the lead character to a person that was once a patient at the asylum. The ending of Session 9 is a little confusing at first, and makes you really think hard about what happened when it's all said and done. The ending of the film will definitely send chills up your spine!<br />Overall this movie is one of the best psychological horror films ever made. The abandoned insane asylum is merely used as the sixth character, scaring you as you learn about its dark past throughout the film. This movie is not about ghosts floating around the insane asylum (although they MAY exist), but rather our own personal demons that can, at some point, take over our lives without us ever knowing. The setting just makes the film that much creepier because of the terrible things that went on in there. I highly recommend this DVD to any horror movie fan that is looking for something completely different, and that will leave them thinking about it long after they're done watching it. EXCELLENT film!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Is it pop or is it jazz? Whatever, it sounds great, and is very personal. As a fan of Diana Krall and Maria Harp (closer to home), this is an artist that I can really enjoy.
B000002N3N|5.0|Enya has one of the most beautiful voices of this day. Her voice is fitting for the style of music she sings. Clear as a bell, her voice is airy and light, as she sings in English, Latin, or Gaelic. There is a lot of power in her voice. The music she chooses supports her voice appropriately, and adds to her sound. She has the ability to conjure up images with each note she sings. Like all of her previous albums, this one is again excellent.<br />There are a many great songs on this album. \\"China Roses\\" has that airy sound that Enya is well known for. She sings the backing vocal as an arpeggio of three long notes of just her voice. Over it, she sings the lyrics of the song in her crisp tone, almost like a crystal bell ringing. The Latin sounding \\"Pax Deorum\\" has a medieval sound to it. Again, she utilizes her voice singing in the background, to add counterpoint to the lyrics.  \\"Anywhere Is\\" sounds like the perfect single for the album. Much more upbeat than the other songs, it has a very staccato feel making it a very energetic song. On the opposite end of the spectrum is \\"Hope Has a Place\\". Here her voice has a very haunting quality to it, made even more so with the organ playing behind her. It is a very beautiful song. <br />I'm amazed at how Enya can keep making new albums that sound similar to her previous ones, yet be totally new for the listener as well. Her voice is aging well, and she seems to improve with each passing album. I hope to hear much more from her in the future, as there is always room in my collection for her beautiful voice.
0553274503|4.0|This book is one of the most get to your feelings book I have ever read. It goes into such detail about things and how a person with disabilities can be treated. the book starts out telling you about a man in his thirties and how people treat him with his disability. His name is Charlie Gordon and he has his own apartment in New York. He has friends as it seems to him at the bakery he works at. He goes to a school for the challenged and is going to have a surgery to help make him smarter and make him understand things in his life. After the surgery he ends up falling for his teacher Ms.Kinnian who doesn't know this and treats him like a friend. This book is the book to read if you need a challenge.
B00006LLNU|5.0|( ) by Sigur Ross is nothing short of a beautiful masterpiece, far more superb than any of the past Sigur albums! It's a climatic journey that begins with nothing and builds to be everything you want it to be and more.  None of the lyrics are in any official world language but rather the ramblings and stammers of a made-up language that the lead singer calls, \\"HOPELANDISH.\\" This band cannot be explained but only experienced. I passed out the first three times I heard track eight, now I just get spontaneous bloody noses... regardless, it hasn't left my CD player since I bought it.
B000084T18|5.0|Ok, Ja Rule has really lost a lot in recent years.  This fella, 50 Cent has really substantially brought a lot to the hip hop community.  Good beats, good lyrics, a little of everything for anyone who likes rap music at all.  P.I.M.P. has a cool Jamaican beat that flows very nicely.  Well worth going out and buying this album.  I have bought tons of hip hop albums, and most chorus lines are pretty weak, these are strong.  I wonder, is there anyone who can raise up in the community to overcome what 50 Cent has established for 2003.  That is all for now...Peace out..Buy the album, don't Share!<br />--D's Factor---*next big thang!* Holla!
0792839730|2.0|Based upon an outstanding book by Cornelius Ryan, this movie tells the story of Field Marshall Montgomery's ambitious but very risky plan to invade Germany in the fall of 1944, by dropping airborne troops to take strategic bridges, and sending an armored column to link up with the airborne troops.  The plan required too much to go perfectly, it didn't, and the plan failed.  The movie is told mostly from the British point of view, but that is appropriate because the British planned the operation and took most of the casualties.  The British 1st Airborne Division, commanded by Roy Urqhart (Sean Connery) was dropped 64 miles behind enemy lines, right on top of a Panzer division, and was nearly wiped out.  Only 2,000 of the 10,000 men in the division made it back to allied lines.<br />This is a war movie in the grand tradition, made before moviemakers could cheat with digital effects.  Thus, the massive air drops, for example, were real.  (The same airdrop portrayed in the recent HBO series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; relied on digital effects to paint in many of the parachutes in the background.)<br />Unfortunately, the film that this DVD was mastered from was in dreadful, really terrible condition.  There are flecks and white spots galore, all throughout the picture.  These white flecks can be digitally &quot;repaired,&quot; but no one bothered to do that on this DVD.  Consequently, this is just about the worst looking DVD I have ever seen.  A movie this magnificent deserved a better DVD treatment, authored from a cleaned up, fully restored film.  My grade of two stars is for the DVD only; the film is easily a five star film, especially for war movie and WWII movie buffs.
B000000WA4|4.0|There's no denying that this album does have some incredible moments on it, but it has nowhere near the consistency, songcraft, ingenuity, and unity of their first two albums (and Pisces Iscariot, though not really included as it IS a B-sides collection).  It's great that they managed to score the biggest-selling double album ever, and it's nice to see the musical talents of the other members showcased a little more prominently.  I still believe, however, that they will go down in rock history more for their first two classics, and that Mellon Collie isn't the be-all end-all album everyone touts it as being.  Corgan AGAIN changes his vocal stylings on this album, but for the worse, as his trademark nasaly whine permeates the entirety of this record.  It's hard to think of him seriously as a singer when he changes his style so much.  This is probably his most natural singing voice, considering he kept this style for all of the remaining Pumpkins albums.<br />As far as the songs go, to be honest the album might have fared better as an artistic whole if it were kept to one disc.  Disc 1 is very chaotic in style, ranging from the swelling strings of \\"Tonight Tonight\\" to the blistering rock of \\"Zero,\\" \\"Bullet w/ Butterfly Wings,\\" and \\"Ode to No One,\\" then suddenly shifts gears again with \\"To Forgive.\\"  Granted, they are for the most part fine songs, although \\"Bullet\\" and \\"Love\\" are frankly silly, and I personally prefer the more consistent Disc 2.  Many more slower songs, abruptly broken up by a couple of rockers, but more smoothly sequenced.  Makes a good companion to their next album \\"Adore,\\" with songs such as \\"In the Arms of Sleep,\\" \\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby,\\" and \\"By Starlight,\\" beautiful, gentle, and expertly penned songs.  \\"XYU,\\" though, is poorly placed and somewhat superfulous.  Silly, again: \\"And into the eyes of the jackal I say KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-BOOM!!!\\"  Uh, whatever.<br />Overall definitely worth owning if you're a Pumpkins fan or even just somewhat like them (everything they did is except Machina, a piece of you-know-what), but if you really want to hear the great band the Pumpkins were (and should've stayed) first listen to Siamese Dream, Pisces Iscariot, and Gish, by all means.  If you want a good companion to these discs and are willing to shell the cash, consider picking up \\"The Aeroplane Flies High,\\" a collection of mostly excellent b-sides from this album that are actually quite better, IMO.
1590710037|5.0|This book is worth getting just for the discussion in the first half on \\"resistance.\\" This is Pressfield's term for anything that prevents the artist from doing \\"the work.\\" Pressfield humorously and elegantly recounts all the stumbling blocks, procrastination, avoidance, neurotic behavior and fear -- all summed up as \\"resistance\\"  -- that any human faces in creating anything.  I laughed out loud as recognized some of these crazy behaviors and irrational fears as very familiar to me. For anyone who is trying to make the transition from creative amateur to working professional it provides a pathway and a license for personal change. Some might complain that this book is composed of short anecdotes but I think it's a refereshing alternative to long-winded self-help books with arcane and convoluted exerecises, workbooks, recipes and programs. Most of defeating any problem begins in recognizing it, and this book helps you do just that.
B000084T18|5.0|This entire album is hot. When artists go national they usually go soft. Not with 50, he still brings it on every track and his flow is still strate from the streets.<br />50 and his crew are the first people in a few years, outside of the Dirty South - New Orleans, that I can respect.<BR>I can feel and believe what he's saying, and after I watched the DVD \\"Get Rich...\\" there was no denying this mans experiences, he's talking about what he knows.<br />Get Rich or Die Trying might not be \\"Ready to Die\\" or \\"Illmatic\\" in every critics eyes now, but it will be in a year, and this is the realest album a nationally recognized emcee will release for a while.<br />If you know your [stuff] or if you like whats dominating the charts, get this and see what 50s all about.
0151008116|3.0|I can't say I found as much in Life of Pi as I have in Roddy Doyle, J.M. Coetzee or Pat Barker, but I can't exactly dismiss it either.  Pi's religious issues, his binary issues, and his species issues are all entertaining.  I half heartedly looked for representations but can't say I was interested enough in Pi to go on.  Compared to Coetzee and the characters from Disgrace or Barker's the Ghost Road (Mann-Booker winners), Pi doesn't stay with a reader long enough for deeper introspection. I thought the algae island and the two boat dialogs the highlight of the book.
B00000K44W|5.0|I thought I was the only one who had ever even heard of this<BR>album let alone thought it was the greatest ever written - what<BR>a pleasant suprise to find that there are a half dozen or so<BR>other folks somewhere in the world who feel the same way!  This<BR>is Tull at their absolute finest - the title and subject matter<BR>of the album fits their style and musicality (and band name)perfectly.  A true bit of a better world that will never be again(and maybe never really was)...and I agree with the gentleman from Washington who feels that &quot;Rover&quot; is the finest song ever written.
0780620828|3.0|\\"Spawn\\" is not a great film. At best, it's average. But it did help to pave the way for new superhero movies like \\"Spider-Man\\" and \\"Daredevil.\\" With its neat-o special effects and really fast pace, this film based on Todd McFarlane's graphic novels (comic books) would be a great movie had the bad guy (Martin Sheen) not been so darn wimpy. Spawn could have seriously kicked some ... had he not been busy crying over losing his wife to his best friend. But the special effects are amazing, and I suppose that's what this film is all about: special effects. Well, there are tons here, ranging from Spawn himself to the fiery pits of Hell, to Satan himself. John Leguizemo is mostly funny as Clown, another of Spawn's nemeses. \\"Spawn\\" was definitely one of the better superhero movies of the nineties, but there weren't many good superhero movies in the nineties to begin with, so I don't know if that's a complement or not. See it if you must, but avoid it if you can.
B00005JKBC|4.0|I like this movie. It's a story of a teacher-student relationship that takes place over a period of years in nasty places, between a veteran CIA agent and a kid he recruits. It's told through flashbacks. Oddly enough, although the flashbacks cover 20 years or more, neither character looks any younger or older in any of the scenes...  that tripped me out. There's no explanation for it, the movie's just that way. Oh well.<br />Anyways, there's a problem and this operative is in trouble, and the agency is asking the older dude for information about him... I love the ending. It's a very clever movie.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver was, in my opinion, a very good book. It was easy to read and easy to understand. The story is about a boy named Jonas, and he lives in a community that is perfect- that is, there is no pain and no memory of any negative experiences. It is essentially a \\"Sameness\\" area where nothing changes. However, when Jonas turns twelve he is given a job in the community. That job involves the memory of all past events- good and bad. Jonas's life changes because he learns the truth about everything, whether he wants to or not.<BR>I would highly recommend this book to anyone. I found that I had a hard time putting it down...I had to know how it ended!
B00005YU1O|5.0|If you are familiar with Linklater's previous efforts (especially &quot;Slackers&quot;), the narrative style of this movie will not surprise you.  Visually however, the animation work is truly imaginative and original, the soundtrack is haunting and the end of the movie is unforgettable.  Along the way, Linklater raises life's ultimate questions and suggests numerous avenues of thought to pursue the answers.  The ideas discussed in this movie are provocative and the manner of raising the issues is wholly original.<br />For those of you who prefer Hollywood, be forewarned.  There are no Hollywood CUES on what to think or feel and the &quot;story&quot; is really a freeform exploration of ideas told with different styles of animation and brought to light through one character and his interactions with numerous bit players.  In short, if you don't enjoy thinking, don't bother with this movie.
B0000399WI|5.0|Shawshank is an absolutely amazing film. Its concept is not especially compelling; you might even call it plain, but oh, the execution! Certainly this is how to make a movie.<br />I saw Shawshank in the cinema, which is always good, but not necessary for a film where the plot and filmatic skill are what draw you in. When I left, I noticed that everyone was sniffling. The film is so beautiful that even the tough people cried. I don't mean that it's a tearjerker either, it doesn't make you cry out of sadness or pull cheap stunts to get the tears flowing. Well, perhaps sadness has something to do with it, but it's a deeper kind of sadness, one that's got tears of joy in it too, not \\"how could they kill the dog?\\" sadness. And while it makes people cry, they're glad they saw it. It's not even my kind of movie, but there's no way I can give it less than a 10.<br />Notice that this movie is loved by all kinds of viewers. From the people who aren't so articulate to the movie snobs, this film hits home on a level that none other I know of does.
B000002L99|2.0|Well, here it is, the great,grand, brand new Van Halen making their first album after Dave, and to be honest it's pretty lame. Not to say that 5150 is total garbage, but it sure doesn't live up to the Van Halen name, either.<br />  First off, I must ask, WHAT IS WROMNG WITH THOSE DRUMS?? Those cheesy 80s electronic drums haven't aged well at all and showcase how much of a pop rather than rock record this was.<br />  Next, Eddie's guitar playing is not up to par with any of the DLR-era albums(even Diver Down). The solos are lackluster and it just sounds like Eddie is disinterested.<br />  I will admit that in terms of vocal range, Sammy Hagar is definitely superior to Diamond Dave. However, he lacks to prescence and more important, lyric-writing of Roth.<br />  All of these factors, in combonation, make most of the more straight-ahead rock tracks on 5150 founder. The exceptions to this would be the generally acceptable title track and Get Up(despite the fact that its an obvious Hot for Teacher ripoff). This leaves the best tracks on the album as the singles(Why Can't This Be Love, Love Walks In, Dreams) as the best songs on the album. To be honest, they're all pretty good, but not at all like Van Halen.<br />  To put a different perspective on it, compare 5150 to 1984. Where 1984 succeeded in incorporating pop elements into VH's music, 5150 totally overdoes it. Sammy was genreally unsatisfactory replacement for David Lee Roth and this album, more than any other, proves it. I heard once that Warner Brothers wanted Eddie to chantge the name of the band after Sammy joined in 1985. Had this been done i would've rated this album much higher than i do here, but since they kept the name, 5150 does not live up to the Van Halen name.
0767817478|4.0|People who chided the remake of \\"Godzilla\\" for not having a plot obviously haven't seen any of the Toho Godzilla movies. They're even more devoid (although they are twice as fun). Roland Emmerich, hot off the success of \\"ID4\\" gathered up his team of special effects wizards to make what I consider to be the best non-Japanese monster film of all time (excluding flicks like \\"Jurassic Park\\"). The pace of the 2.5 hour movie is surprisingly quick and the dialogue, while often cheesy, is good summer-movie fun. I really don't see why so many people have a problem with this movie. It's got laughs, great special effects, a cool monster, and those baby Godzillas are way cool. I like movies like this, so maybe I'm a little shallow. But at least I'm having fun!
B0000640S1|4.0|This is the original, written by David Morell, only slightly altered. It's a wonderful story. Yes, when you think of Rambo you think of the [stuff] they piled on after; but there's a reason they made them... and that's because this movie is powerful and excellent. I was skeptical, but after watching this movie I have to admit that Sylvester Stalone is a much better actor than I ever gave him credit for. I always dismissed him as a beefcake not-much-dialog tough guy; this movie... well, it doesn't break that mold, but it shows you a bit more depth than you might imagine.<br />I read the book years ago and was deeply moved; David Morell is a terrific author. This is the first time I've seen the movie, but I'm very glad to have it on DVD and I'll easily be able to  watch it again.
B000067CPX|5.0|RHCP has done it again.....this album is great infact more than great........how do they do it?..i'm simply amazed by RHCP. Still gettin things done after all this years. All the tracks are superb...plus their arrangements are fantastic. The album kicks-off with the hugely popular 'By the Way', then the rest is history! Trust me get his album, you will not regret it at all, escpecailly all you RHCP fans!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I agree with the editorial review in the sense that this movie cannot be pinned down.  Is it a science fiction thriller?  A movie about schizophrenia?  A movie about the late 80's in America?  It is all of these things and more.  This is a stunning debut from Richard Kelly with superb acting by all, especially the star, Jake Gyllenhaal.  Jake is an admittedly troubled teen in psycho-therapy who is called upon to save the world.  The way that Richard Kelly renders this comic book plot however, is incredibly complex.  Like the plot, the meaning of the movie cannot be discerned even after repeated viewings.  The experience is exhilirating even after repeated viewings and the movie continues to provoke thought and debate.  One thing that's not debatable; this is one unique, heartfelt movie, and is highly recommended.
0393316041|3.0|Whie I understand that this Nobel Laureate may have made some significant contributions to the study a physics, I find it tremendously inappropirate to make a mockery of it.<br />Where woud we be without gravity or even string theory? I don't know, but I certainly do not want to go there. The honorable physician should take his job seriously, not all hokey jokey. Treat physics with the grace and dignity that it affords the universe.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Grease is everything a musical film should be.  It is a visual and aural feast that has captured the imaginations of audiences for over 25 years.  Everything is larger than life and the action occurs amidst a riot of 1950s colour.  Who cares if the cast is largely composed of 30-somethings playing teenagers?  The key to Grease's success is not realism, but the enormous amount of infectious energy exuded by the cast. <br />This zest for life is particularly apparent in the lively and eminently sing-able chorus song-and-dance numbers.  The tunes of retro party favourites such as 'Greased Lightning' and 'You're The One That I Want' will probably be familiar to many viewers, but lesser known songs, including the short and sarcastic 'Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee' and 'Beauty School Drop-Out' (with Frankie Avalon in the role of guardian angel) are also fun toe-tappers.  <br />Musicals work best when, like Grease, they concentrate on the music rather than the plot; however, the story here is completely adequate.  Sandy and Danny had a summer fling at the beach, but at school Danny has an image to uphold - which Sandy doesn't really fit - so their senior year at Rydell High is spent in a daze of \\"will-they-won't-they\\" teenage angst.<br />John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John set the screen alight as Danny and Sandy; there are some fabulous character roles in the \\"Pink Ladies\\" and \\"T-Birds\\" school cliques, and some very funny cameos - particularly the pairing of Principal McGee and Blanche the office lady.  There are sexual innuendoes aplenty if you look hard enough, and despite the fact that the movie is set half a century ago, the viewer is led to conclude that teenagers have been, and will always be, teenagers.
0553274503|5.0|I really liked this book!!  It's about a young man named Charley , and he is mentally challenged. In the book, their is also a mouse named Algernon who once had an operation to make him smarter. Docters wanted to perform this operation on humans, but first, they had to test it on an animal. Algernon was the one picked for the operation, and it did make him smarter! The docters asked Charley if he wanted the operation and Charley said yes. The operation also made him smarter, and so he lived a normal life, until the operation backfired and Charley discovered that something bad was slowly going to happen to him; he was going to go back to being mentally challenged.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Oooooh! I love this movie. A friend of mine didn't like it and said bad things about it, so I put off watching it and wasn't expecting much. But he never pays attention when he watches movies, he's always off thinking of something else, and this movie really needs your full and undivided attention. It's very complicated, very quiet in some ways. There are some perfect moments; where all the gentry are listening to the gentleman play the piano in the glittering room, and all the servants are very carefully and quitely listening from the stairs and behind doorways; you can feel the stillness in the house.<br />It is a murder mystery, in it's way. And a sort of love story, and a story about class structure in England and the way life used to be. I'm very glad I have it.

B00000JLWW|5.0|People said that Titanic would be an enormous flop, destroying 20th Century Fox more than Cleopatra did,35 years ago!!! But, it wasn't, it was a phenomenal hit!!!! Teenagers loved it because they felt like Rose (she was 17 when Titanic sank): she's beautiful, she's rebellious, she's searching for her true love,she hates the man who is destined to her, she's always unhappy, she doesn't like living in the rich world and teens could easily identify themselves to her and teens (girls) loved Jack beavuse he was handsome, brave, courageous,funny,serious, intelligent and full of life!!!And I was a kid when Titanic was released in France, Korea and South Africa, in the school newspapers, people said their favourite movie was Titanic because it talks it was romantic and they loved the characters (Jack and Rose). They loved Leonardo di Caprio especially and that was always annoying me (I don't like him) and in France, it was the most high-grossing movie of all time, beating \\"La grande vadrouille\\" (I recommend it to you, it's a very funny French comedy) with 21 000 000 tickets sold against 14 000 000 tickets sold!!!<br />Ican't forget that movie, its music so beautiful and making me always cry when i listen to it, the characters who are very emotionnal, the costumes, the art direction, the visual effects (impressive!!! Bravo!!), the direction (thanks to James Cameron), the song amazingly  sung by Celine Dion which made her also a super duper star!!!!!!!!<br />Titanic is the movie that nobody will forget even if it was released 6 years ago!!!!!!!!!

B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm impressed by this series. I saw one episode on TV and on the recomendation of a friend (ok, of a passel of friends) bought the series for my husband, who was agitating for it. We both like it a great deal. It's something you can watch slowly, with some consideration, and enjoy (in a somber kind of way). It's about the original Airborn units... The interviews with the vetrans make it something very special. This is the last generation that these vetrans will be alive to tell their story, and we should listen and learn from them; they are us, and this war is something different from any war before or since. It's not for no reason it was called a world war. Trnasportation and communication were finaly good enough to involve the entire planet in a conflict, but the tactics and planning were still evolving to catch up with this fact. A lot of firsts, in that war.

B00005JKCH|5.0|I&iexcl;¯ll admit that I wasn&iexcl;¯t a die hard Spider-Man fan in the past.  I was a Batman fan but this film is visually and emotionally amazing.  This film does not go camp nor does is borrow on ideas already seen in superhero films.  It is almost a real human story.  You are left sympathizing for Peter Parker and his struggles and then cheering him on as he continues to do what is right despite all of his personal setbacks. Tobey Maguire did for this film what Michael Keaton did for Batman.  He is the essential Spider-Man.  You see that he feels right at home as Spider-Man and succeeds at making Peter Parker his own.  What is arguably the greatest and most successful comic book films of all time, it is almost as if you are reading a comic book.<br />Willem Dafoe is simply astonishing as the Green Goblin.  While it is true that he does not compare to Nicholson as the Joker and Hackman as Luthor, he stands on his own as Osborn.  In the beginning, he&iexcl;¯s an ordinary billionaire, but after the accident, the transition he makes from businessman to raving psychotic is simply amazing.  You can tell he studied his character because his diction and his facial expressions are amazing if not straight out of the comics.  I remember feeling that Kirsten Dunst was miscast as Mary Jane but when I saw the film, I changed my mind.  This young lady is going places and it shows.  Mary Jane is portrayed as more of a victim in this film than she ever has in the comics or on the animated TV shows and it works.  Dunst&iexcl;¯s performance is breathtaking as she blends together the right mix of class, savvy, and sex appeal to make Mary Jane one of the most memorable comic book heroines ever portrayed on film.<br />All in all, a great film which should be looked at as one of the greatest of all time.  The violence may turn some of you off but a comic book film without violence is like a romance film without kisses.  The CGI is off the charts, every time I watch it, I have difficulty telling the CGI from the real stuff.  That is amazing.  LOTR may be looked at as the better film visually and critically, but this is one film that we will not soon forget.he CGI from the real stuff.  That is amazing.

B000001FKY|5.0|This album is in fact their most successful to date. It was their last collaboration with producer Mutt Lange, though not the last to hear guitar primo, Steve Clark's awesome guitar sound. The sound is very polished. The drums are electronic (Allen didn't play an acoustic kit until 1995) and the songs were...after recording...dissected and put together piece by piece, so every piece was just so! This album set a new scale of recording albums. When this was released, studios and producers were still using a method that was outdated at the time. It was very ahead of it's time, and to this day, it sounds ahead of it's time.<BR>NOTE:  One more thing...Def Leppard is not a heavy metal band.  They have said this time and time again and nobody seems to get it.  They never were and never wanted to be a heavy metal band.

B00005ATQD|2.0|Kubrick's last film sums up the bulk of his oeuvre. The pace varies from slow to dead slow. The characters are completely vapid nonentities: shallow beyond belief, and just uniquely uninteresting people. The dialogue is banal in the extreme, repetitious, meaningless and only semi-articulate. There is an obsessive attention to design, irrelevant details and photographic technology, handled with very little imagination or creativity. The viewer sits there, hypnotised, mouth agape, wondering if anything is ever going to happen, or if there is anything s/he can identify with or feel engaged by. The plot, whether it is a well-heeled middle-class dream fantasy or whether it isn't, is stupefyingly tedious and unbelievable. The culmination is bleak and empty, a grim and humourless vision of life's utter pointlessness; the joyless shell of a nuclear family during the ha-ha happy holidays season who cannot think of a single meaningful thing to do. I had another look at A Clockwork Orange, and it was very similar. Why did this exercise in prolonged tedium have such an impact when I first saw it all those years ago? These films just don't stand up. They don't entertain, they don't uplift, they add up to nothing but a feeling of numbness and desolation.
B000059XUP|5.0|i wrote a reviw of this  but am not sure if it will be posted.<br />this is a great movie it is origional and a good sequal without steping on brandon lee's memory. it is about ashe the new crow  who is getting revenge on the thugs who killed him and his son. sarah's back from the first one. im tired of people saying they should have changed the crows makeup. here is why it makes sense sarah paints ashe's face like what she saw eric draven's face painted like. if your going to hate this movie because of that then rent the CROW SALVATION. thanks for reading and give me a good review.
0064407667|4.0|I was on a cultural exchange trip to China with a bunch of teenagers and twenty somethings.  I bought three of these books in case \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" couldn't hold my attention on the long plane rides. (Which it could, thankfully)<br />But something magical happened with the SUE books.  Every night before bedtime, I had a handful of young adults gather around as I read aloud 2 chapters a night.  How unfortunate that I ran out of books before I ran out of trip.  It became such an important winding down time for us, I promised my biggest fans that I'd make an audio tape of the next book for them and send it to them when I got home for those tough to sleep nights.<br />I think Snicket keeps the characters somewhat flat so that you don't feel as devastated about their great losses.  And yet, I really wouldn't read these to children because they'd be too dark.  But in our situation it was wonderful.<br />Next trip, I'm taking SUE along for sure.
B000084T18|5.0|This album is the hottness. every song on the album is great. he has three bonus tracks that are off the hook. he talks bout gangs money hoes cars. but its not like he raps on the whole album , he sings too.

0446677450|5.0|I'm the CEO of a business acceleration company and was very impressed with the message behind this book.  Regardless of how you choose to make money, Rich Dad Poor Dad explains the importance of managing your money and spending wisely.  If more people would define assets and liabilities the way Robert Kiyosaki does, the world would be much more financially secure.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially young people who are learning how to manage their money.  Regardless of how much money you have or make, this book will change your outlook on how you spend and invest it.  It will fundamentally change your mindset when you face decisions about assuming debts-something that will affect you for the rest of your life.  I hope you find this review helpful.<br />Steve Watts

B00005JLEU|5.0|I saw Spirited Away two times in Spain (in Spanish, naturally), and it has become my absolute favourite of all of Hayao Miyazakis films. Miyazaki is, for me, the epitome of Japanese animation and the undisputed master of his craft. He fills the screen with minute details, doing most of the painstaking animation by hand in an age of computer animation (see Disney). His films are always unique both in visual style and in plot, expressing lost mythologies, alternate worlds, and the spirits that surround us. In Japan anime is not only for children, a concept which Western audiences have difficulty understanding. These are more than mere cartoons; they are explorations of self, nature, and in some ways Japanese society (there are frequently Japanese elements in many of Miyazakis films although most are set in fictitious places).<br />Spirited Away tells the lovely story of Chihiro, a ten-year-old Japanese girl that is moving to a new town. Along the way the family stops to explore a mysterious tunnel that turns out to be a pathway into an alternate world filled with gods, witches and strange creatures. Chihiros parents are transformed into large pigs as punishment for their gluttony (there are frequently morals in Miyazakis tales as well), and Chihiro begins work for the witch Yubaba while desperately trying to find a cure for her parents before they are eaten (!). She befriends Haku, a mysterious boy whom she feels some past connection to, and together the two attempt to overthrow the tyrannical reign of Yubaba.<br />A gorgeous film, with a beautiful soundtrack by frequent Miyazai collaborator Joe Hisaishi (Princess Mononoke, Kikis Delivery Service, Totoro). There are some elements that may be disturbing to very young children (the threat of Chihiros parents being eaten even as a pigs head is shown at a feast, several scary rampages, some blood), but overall this is an excellent, quality film that is a feast for the eyes, ears, and imagination, and a true journey of the spirit.s, ears, and imagination, and a true journey of the spirit.

Schindler's List was mainly from the perspective of Schindler and, by all means, it was a very good story too.  However, \\"Life is Beautiful\\" is from the perspective of a Jewish man. A man who is portrayed to be ordinary in many respects and even a natural clown to some degree, but you eventually realize that this man is no 'clown' when it comes to what is most important to him.  Benigni uses a device at the very end of the movie that leaves you with no doubt of what that is for him and should be for all of us; love.  ...

The only time I ever put this in my system is when I want to hear some other Eminem stuff, I listen to the sampler it came with more than the soundtrack itself.  Don't get me wrong, Eminem's tracks are tight but the rest leaves you wanting more M.
B00005Y228|4.0|Just recently picking up this CD after hearing numerous tracks and I was not disappointed. Ms. Minogue is so refreshing in her approach. I thought this album would slow down at some point but it doesn't and I loved that. She definitely gives these tired and dried-up American female \\"singers\\" a run for their money. Kylie is not afraid to stick to the dancefloor and maintain a House vibe,rather than coming down and getting all sappy! Who needs that?<BR> I find myself listening to some tracks repeatedly and I kind of wish some of the songs were longer. It would have been even better to include some re-mixes.  But, for the most part the entire album is very sexy and well-done. She's always been huge on the UK charts. But that's because that audience is  a bit more sophisticated and not as young the American listener. I just don't think Americans really get what she's doing and what she's all about. But who cares if they do or they don't? I know I enjoy it and I know exactly where she's coming from. I certainly caught Kylie's fever and damn it feels good.
B00005JKZ3|4.0|In light of all the recent negative reviews, I feel I have to say something about this film. This happens to be an excellent movie, loaded with laughs, great acting and, most of all, fantastic special effects. C'mon... You think the effects in this film are bad?!? If nothing else, Rick Baker and ILM, the leaders in their respective industries, do a stupendous job of realizing Sonnenfeld's vision. Yes, the plot is simple and flimsy... This is a si-fi comedy blockbuster, remember? Yes, the film is derivative of the first film, to at least some extent. But this is a sequel, right? Same characters, same design elements... I can think of MANY other sequels that are MUCH more derivative or their originals. I think people have grown far too accustomed to expecting their own, specific opinion of what a movie should be override their ability to enjoy an artistic experience. This film is at least as good as the original and certainly much better on a technical level.

This is the foo fighters best album in my point of view.  every song on it is an A+!  I dont think even Nirvana Nevermind could live up to this.  This album is too underated and its a musical peace of art.  An album of heartbreak songs....it must be true that pain equals great art.  Buy this, maybe it will change your life like it did mine.
0066620996|2.0|2/11/02  I thumbed Jim Collins' book several times, surprized that the great jacket which had made me borrow it from the library had not duplicated itself inspirationally through the many pages of info on CEO and Corporation scenarios..Finally page 205 ,hit me as the perfect page ..that one person amist his 'ex-students from Stanford'who wanted to know why greatest,why not just success..Collin's explanation on Pgs 204-206 re: Good,Great,and what he considers 'Perpetuating Mediocrity' is a driving force for many(e.g.Henry Ford, Bill Gates,Martha Stewart,Bill Cosby) and has even been thrust on others(some political leaders,Regis Philbin,many newspaper anchorpersons,dynasty(s)via philanthropy,etc)..but good does not give a feeling of 'mediocrity' to all who give their best(as a Marketing Teacher\\" once explained at a local University ,to build a better mouse trap\\" is not enough ,you must find the consumer whose looking for one(often it might be just\\"The Greatest\\" wanting to buy your idea or 'take you over' in a legal merger)...being in the right place at the right time is more crucial(as those whose movies have been pulled from the shelves when it was the theme of a surprize 'bad event'...Appendix 1.D mentions 28 companies were selected(11 good-to great,11 dirct comparison,6 unsustained comparison) with  Appendix 1.D'(Pg 246)having a section : \\"Role of layoffs\\"(many would 'differ with the author' as that being the most suitable way to define the activity of layoff).
B00005KARK|5.0|Why am I not surprised that there is someone reviewing this classic who trashes it as if they had never seen it and were offended by the cultural sensitivity issues that are part of the film.  (See the Tallahassee reviewer titled \\"Do not purchase this video for children\\" January 21, 2003)  For crying out loud, this script reflects what was normal at the time the film was first released.  It's full of classic pieces that of course include a white dominated societal commentary on what was perceived as appropriate black cultural roots at that time.  Is it outdated?  Sure, so is nearly every other film from that era.  Does this make it less of a classic?  Absolutely not.  In fact, this is the *real* Disney, long before it was sanitized for the Anaheim-Orlando crowd.  Is the film inappropriate for a 21st century kid?  That's a parental decision, but if you plan to shelter your child from the real history of the U.S., they will have a rude awakening (with all the accompanying psychoses) that you *won't* be able to control.  My kids loved this film when they were very young.....we talked about the cultural issues by the time they were in school.....in fact, I distinctly remember them coming home to ask why some kids treated others so badly because of the color of their skin, their accents, etc.  We used Dumbo to show them what used to be, was is today, and how to deal with it.  And there was never a place where the original empathy of the film was lost on them.  They have repeatedly made personal decisions and stood up against improper cultural slurs their entire lives (they are all either in college or their final years of high school now).  I've been pleased with how they can see a cultural slur coming and are not willing to put up with any of the culturally \\"acceptable\\" ways of trashing others' ethnicity.<br />Now, what about the film?  This is a great Disney classic from the days when there was a full bodied, earthy smell to what they did.  It's release in this formatprovides a historical window on American culture from the 1950s that is true and clear.  It loses nothing in the 21st century translation and in fact, gains considerably from it's historical context.  A great child's film that every adult needs to understand!
078322799X|3.0|Like many of the other reviewers here, I believe that The Frighteners is a very unique and well crafted movie.  Great special effects, and a great story.  However, the movie is ruined by the most annoying character EVER.  Whoever decided to write in the paranoid FBI agent spoiled an otherwise excellent movie.  The FBI agent's character doesn't fit in with the theme of of the movie or the seriousness of the other characters.  He is so annoying that repeated viewings of The Frighteners are unbearable.
0899661270|5.0|The good news--Georgette Heyer is the standard by which all writers of Regency Romance are judged.  The bad news--after reading any of Ms. Heyer's books, one becomes a true stickler for detail when it comes to other writers in this genre.<br />Like most of her novels, 'Cotillion' is a witty and elegant romp through the world of the beau monde--its foibles and its fashions.<br />Kitty Charing in her own right is as assertive as any modern heroine as she learns to navigate the convoluted social waters of London.  Unlike those around her, she sees the good in everyone, which of course lead to some comic mishaps.  Her pretend 'fiance' Freddy is wonderful as the not-quite-as-brain-dead-as-everyone-thinks-him man about town.<br />Like all of Ms. Heyer's novels, it does help to be rather familiar with regency cant, and there are actually fan sites out there with glossaries of regency slang used in her books.
0451147960|3.0|This book is dated, and the plot took a while to sink in for me.  However, once I got into the swing of things, I enjoyed this book very much.<br />Because the amount of artwork by any given artist is finite, discovering that there may be an undiscovered work by a famous artist is a huge discovery in the art world.  When an art student studying abroad hears that not all of Modigliani's works are available, she delightedly decides to find the one that was reputedly hidden during the War.<br />The many twists of the plot are difficult to follow until they tie together at the end of the book.  The plots do fit nicely! but it is confusing to follow throughout the body of the book.<br />This is not Ken Follett's best work.  However, for an early work, it's quite good; furthermore, it's a lot better than a lot of the drek that some authors are trying to pass off as literature.
B0000797IO|4.0|Why do so many reviewers think they have to give the entire plot in their comments? Here is something to think about that avoids giving it all away.<br />Jennifer Aniston, of course she's a good actress, otherwise she wouldn't have made it as far as she has. Is she a great actress? We'll need a half dozen films like Good Girl to decide. At least she has started....which is more than you can say for most of the cast of Friends.<br />Is her character, Justine, a discarded wife? I'm not sure, her husband seems to have discarded himself too and I sure didn't see Justine valuing him too much either. Reviewers who are talking about \\"her destiny lies in her own hands and not in the hands of those around her\\" are pretty far off the mark in my opinion. This plot is a tangled web of interwoven interpersonal interactions, nicely done with a good number of unexpected twists and decisions by the characters that make sure you can't predict what will happen next. And that, folks, is what makes a movie intriguing. That's a pretty good offering and certainly more than you get from most films these days. Nice job by director Miguel Arteta and the script writing team.

0064471837|5.0|In this epic story told not unlike tales in the golden age of fantasy, Garth Nix has successfully joined great names, such as those synonomous with fantasy (J.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis).<br />This book is not at all related to any other tale, it is an original, pure and simple, using no familiar concepts or ideas to convey the main point of the story.<br />In the story, a adolescent girl named Sabriel realizes that her father, Abhorsen, has been detained or trapped somewhere in the endless river of death, and as the story progresses, it becomes obvious that the culprit is the Great Dead creature Kerrigor, who had once, over two hundred years in the past, had tried to destroy the Charter, the magical force that binds the world together.<br />Along the way on the quest for an understanding of her heritage and her father, Sabriel meets the Free Magic being Mogget, chained to the power of the Abhorsens unwillingly, beneath the quiet exterior of his cat-like bady lies a murderous being of tremendous power which Sabriel will have to confront.  She also meets the imprisioned prince of the Old Kingdom, who calls himself Touchstone, and is also unwilling to share with Sabriel his tarnished past which Mogget seems to know about.<br />The story includes magic, love, adventure, and brilliant new ideas by a writer rising in promenince among the literary society.  All the components are there for an epic, and Nix brings them all together brilliantly.  A classic.

I don't think this has gotten a bad review yet, so I think I'll just join the crowd in recommending this book to every parent, wannabe parent, or friend/relative of a parent.

1576751988|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, and found it to be fantastic. It was concise, clear and well-written with precise exercises to do. Though it has some ideas that I have seen oftentimes before, yet this made me see my assignments and projects differently with a new perspective. <BR>This was one book I read in almost one sitting. That was my first step in not procrastinating. I have recommended the book to a few of my friends. This was a hard cover version of the book.
B000001G89|5.0|I have to throw my unabashed endorsement of this recording into the ring. Abbado, Berganza, Domingo, Cotrubas, Milnes made a superb team and a CARMEN for the ages. I first bought this on vinyl when it was a first issue in the seventies. I have owned and listened to many other versions. But I keep coming back to this, drawn like a moth to a flame by Berganza's intelligent, haughty, supremely self-aware portrayal of the supreme operatic heroine. You sense that Berganza would never let this Carmen become a mere victim. She knows she is implicit in her own destiny, but rides it all the way, regardless. Abbado elicited ravishing sounds from the LSO, intensifying the lighter-than-air quality of French opera, but spiced with peppery Spanish flavours. You can't go wrong with this recording. I just bought it on CD again. I love it so!

6304711891|1.0|While the performances of the actors are satisfactory, they can not compensate for the formulaic, unoriginal, predictable, and sucker-by-previews style of worthless movies directed by the Michael Bay, and produced Jerry Bruckheimer.  Yeah, I said it!  Many of you thought so in one form or another when you saw Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys, or Armageddon.  Their movies wreak of contrived melodrama (the massacre of the squad inside the prison), weak plot (get in, get out), weak dialogue (with a few mild attempts at humour).  How can a movie be exciting if it is utterly predictable, and so insipid and ludicrous that it is unbelievable?  If you want a real action movie, watch Die Hard!  It has everything, this movie could never achieve.
B00006GA4C|5.0|One of the best Loooooooooong trippy aural blasts that might be right up there with Iron Butterfly's \\"Inna godda de Vida\\"...\\"Inside Looking Out\\" is an old blues tune.  <br />It is given a treatment by the Grand Funk Railroad that carries the listener on a spiralling journey.  The gain is up a touch...sounds real and heavy.  I wonder if it were to be played at our local Music Fests such as HFSetival here in the DC area...what a mind blowing experiance for a whole new generation of tuned in/raving listeners...what do YOU think the scene would look like?  I think during the solo riffs, the crowd whould be laid flat back, trippin to a heavy psychodelic wonderous piece of musical history.  Play it loud over and over.<br />Hey, if there are any members of 3 man Michigan Band Grand Funk reading this: come on down to DC this summer:  Contact me @ ....com<br />Enjoy the Ride,<br />Terry

B00005JKCH|1.0|The '60's cartoons were better. This film was a missed opportunity. It should have been groundbreaking- a classic telling of Marvel's most celebrated hero. Instead, it is just an unimaginative, unimpressive, mediocre popcorn flick. I must put the blame squarely on Sam Raimi's overwhelmed shoulders. It is quite obvious that he was completely at a loss as to how to do the film right. First off- the film is not cast well. Tobey Maguire is not bad, yet not well suited as Peter Parker, as he is too neebish, short and nasally voiced to convince me he is a superhero. He looks like he belongs in middle school, not high school. Kirsten Dunst is horribly miscast as Mary Jane Watson. Aside from her not resembling her comic counterpart, she is just too unattractive to convince me that Peter would fall for her. Willem Dafoe churns out a typical over the top villain performance for the umpteenth time and looks like a green power ranger reject. Aside from the casting problem, is the script, which is in desperate need of a rewrite. ' Who Am I?' Peter Parker says at the beginning and ending of the film. Who are you talking to?? Nobody asked you who you are!! Why is Macy Gray making a cameo in this film? No reason at all, other than she simply convinced Raimi to put her in. Silly singing, parades and balloons were stolen from Tim Burton's closet and put in this film. Stupid decisions like this help kill the film. Add BAD cgi effects into the mix, and it soon becomes apparent that this film is beyond redemption. Cheap, amaturish effects are also thrown in, such as having Peter sticking to walls and ceilings and not showing how he got there, utensils sticking to his hands, ridiculous 'Spidey-sense' sound effects ... puh-lease. You needed a budget of  100+ Million to do that? If it seems I'm a bit hard on this film, it's because I am a Marvel fan and it should have been a great film. Instead, it's just not a very good one. Like I said, a missed opportunity. I hope the sequel is a lot better, but since it appears the same director and cast are returning, I don't have much hope of that happening.

Go to one of his showes sometimes.
B000002VE7|5.0|This was their strongest album in a while, both musically and lyrically. Was Eric Woolfson having a nervous breakdown? The theme here is clearly one of losing touch with reality, bitterness at the real world, and drinking too much (&quot;it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain&quot;).<br />This was the next-to-last album with Woolfson as lyricist and vocalist, and I can't help but think it was his siren call for help at not dealing with the fact that the Project was not as successful as it used to be and as maybe Alan was telling Eric it would be. <br />The album opens with the song Stereotomy, a vague title that seems to mean different things to different people. From what I can tell, it has to do with splitting the two hemispheres of the brain--maybe an allusion to the splitting of Eric and Alan philosophically? The song has a lot to do with fear and paranoia (&quot;Silent knives dissect me and I feel no pain...do anything you want with me...it's always the same&quot;). Beaujolais is very catchy, but check out those depressing lyrics (&quot;One race I can't win with an alter ego...wherever I go he go...Beaujolais will be my ruin&quot;). Urbania is one of Alan's most creative instrumentals, with a jazzy flair unlike any other recording of his. Limelight sounds like Eric giving up on ever being in the limelight (&quot;I can hear the roar of a distant crowd, they are calling my name...limelight you were all I ever wanted since it all began&quot;). In The Real World is very much about not being in the real world (&quot;Don't want to live my life in the real world&quot;). Where's The Walrus? is also one of the Project's more creative instrumentals; very dark guitar &amp; synth-oriented. Light Of The World describes a descent into powerful depression  &quot;I am lost in so many ways I can walk no more...No matter how much I try the tide will not turn for me...I can take no more&quot;. Chinese Whispers is a short but interesting transition to the next song. Stereotomy 2 closes with a reprise of the opening.<br />Don't get me wrong--this isn't boring. Depression and conflict are powerful emotions, and this album has a lot more emotion and oomph than most of the Project's boring 1980's albums. This is eccentric but a real keeper.
B000001ESN|5.0|I've always thought &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; was a somewhat underappreciated Rush album.  I mean, I know it was hugely successful in its own right, but it seems that when it comes to Rush I keep hearing &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; this and &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; that.  I, for one, find &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; to be clearly the better of the two albums.  For one thing, I think &quot;Shapeshifter&quot; from MP may well be the worst Rush song EVER, but there's more to it than that.  For whatever reason, everything came together on &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; in a way that it didn't on MP.  This may not be the best Rush album, but it's probably the best combination of musicianship, creativity, and heart in their catalogue.<br />&quot;Permanent Waves&quot; was the first Rush album I ever listened to, and for newbies it's definitely a good place to start.  At six songs clocking in at an efficient thirty-five minutes, it's a handy introduction to everything that Rush has to offer.  What's most instantly notable about the band is, of course, their musicianship.  Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart are all masters of their instruments who play some complex stuff, but they all play together very well, with no one stepping on anyone else.  And while Geddy's vocals certainly never made anyone forget about Frank Sinatra, there's no denying his distinctiveness, and he adds some much-needed emotion to the polish of the music.<br />However, what I think really elevates &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; to the top of the rock heap is the songwriting.  For this album Rush turned down the progressive elements from their previous albums to create a more radio-friendly sound, but this is still pretty advanced stuff, and some of their best tunes can be found here.  The opening combination of &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot; exemplifies exactly what's so great about &quot;Permanent Waves.&quot;  Both songs feature the intricate rhythms that characterize much of Rush's work, but at the same time they include catchy melodies and shredding guitar solos that just about anyone could enjoy.  &quot;Entre Nous&quot;  is another catchy song that's extremely simple by Rush standards, but it's got an addictive guitar riff and some synthesizers for depth.  What's more, all of these songs have a feeling of &quot;warmth&quot; that's not at all in keeping with the &quot;coldly intellectual&quot; tag that's often associated with the band.  What's not to like?<br />The last two songs are classics as well.  &quot;Different Strings&quot; is an acoustic song that's sort of a departure for Rush, but it works.  The lyrics are thoughtful, Geddy's singing is heartfelt, and it provides a nice break from the hard-driving stuff.  The album ends with the obligatory epic, &quot;Natural Science.&quot;  At just over nine minutes, it's nowhere near Rush's longest song, but it still has that distinctly &quot;epic&quot; feel.  The song starts off slow, but it picks up in intensity and complexity as it goes along, and there are plenty of instrumental passages that let the guys show off their skills.  It's a downright invigorating song, one of Rush's best.<br />Anyway, not to down &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; or any other Rush album, but I really don't think PW has gotten quite the credit it deserves, at least compared to some of their other work.  &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; may not be as grandiose as its predecessors, or quite as accessible as its sucessors, but it balances the two elements perfectly.  I know this is an extremely subjective matter, but I find &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; to be as good a Rush album as any.

B00005JL96|5.0|Disney has finally come up with a great movie after the Lion King.  If you have lost faith in Disney movies, this movie will change your mind about the movies, although not Disney Channel.  This movie is teen wannabe free.  NO KISSING AND NO TEENAGE WANNABE STUFF.  IT'S NOT LIKE DISNEY CHANNEL.  The only thing close to romance is Nina and David being friends who each have a crush on each other.  No classic teen flirting.  <br />This is the best science fiction cartoon movie Disney came up with.  (not like Atlantis or Treasure Planet)  This movie is worth the money because it will make you want to watch it again because it is a cute story.  Even if you bore it out, within a month or two, you will want to watch it again.  <br />The music in this film is pop star free, except for credits.  No dumb attempts to try to promote the pop music industry.  The music is just movie orchestra music, Hawain choir, and some Elvis songs.  Even the pop music is pretty.  <br />Just buy this, you won't regret it.  This is the best Disney movie.  The technology we have today makes this just as memorable as the old Disney movies
B000088E6M|4.0|With Emenim and Dre producing this album I anticipated some great beats which it has.  The first couple tracks do get off to a slow start.  Seems like other reviews I have read say 50 cent is one rapper who has something to say.  Seems to me all he talks about over and over is the same thing on every rapper does.  Just hos, guns, drugs and having beef with some other rapper.  He does pull off some good lines and I like his flow but I wouldn't call him a prophet.  He's just getting down to some good beats.  I give this album 4 of 5 stars based on the fact that I like Em and Dre and I think they did well producing this album.  It's one I can listen to all the way through and enjoy it for the most part.

B00005K3NY|2.0|I honestly can't see what all the fuss is about. For years I've heard how Scanners was a classic piece of sci-fi, how it was David Cronenberg's first masterpiece. But when I sat down to see it I could only see small pieces of greatness drowning in a sea of a greatly overrated film.<br />Sure Cronenberg is a talented director, and Scanners shows his promise, but this story about people with telekinetic powers seems like it comes from a rough draft of a script without the ideas, plot and characters fully worked out. Almost as bothersome is the monotone acting by the lead, a newly recruited scanner sent to kill another attempting to take over the world. Though many have said the acting is intentional, it just came across to me that he was a very poor actor (of course, the DVD's badly dubbed voices could account for some of that). But more so, every scene seems as though it's still a work in progress, that the screenwriter (Cronenberg) ran out of time before production. It doesn't feel remotely closed to polished.<br />I admit that if I had seen this in 1980 when it came out, that it may have had a bigger impact on me. But I've seen plenty of sci-fi prior to this time that was leagues better then Scanners. I know I'll catch some flak for my unpopular view, but it's my honest, well thought out opinion. Of course I thought the \\"exploding head\\" scene was excellent in its shocking quality, the rest of the film just seemed to fall from there.<br />Scanners was a major disappointment for me, and though I know many disagree with me, I can't share their enthusiasm. It's worth checking out if only too see the exploding head, but, for me, is otherwise a forgettable film.
B000088E6M|4.0|Yo all yall gotta cop this joint.  50 shines on this cd and it has songs that have a tendency for longevity.  My favorite song by far is &quot;Many Men&quot;, on that song 50 shows a depressional - gangsta side.  That song belongs being his next single.  Its got other hot joints like I Get High All The Time, Wanksta, and U Not Like Me which will keep this cd bumpin in ur ride for a long long time.  50 Cent may be becoming mainstream but he's bringin that real thug Queens muzik right in ur eardrums like Cormega and Mobb Deep.  Everyone may not like it but ur either gonna love it or hate it!  One Love
B00005JKG9|4.0|A fantastic film about desperation in a shady real estate office, Glengarry Glen Ross has a tight script, tight scenes and a superb cast. Never revealing too much, it focuses on character rather then plot.<br />It's a small movie, almost fully taking place in the real estate office (a result, no doubt, from being a David Mamet play adaptation), that doesn't waste it's time on exposition. Instead it jumps into this corrupt real estate world as though the audience already knows all about it, and flushes out the excellent characters. Each and every member of this cast shines, from Kevin Spacey to Al Pacino. But above all Jack Lemmon steals the show. His portrayal of desperate salesman is right on the mark, eliciting a wide range of emotions. He has the most depth, the most feeling, and this is positively one Lemmon's greatest roles.<br />What helps makes this movie work is how each scene is more of a character study through which the plot is moved almost subliminally. You understand what's happening, but the movie never has to overstate the situation, it's clear in the context of the dialog. And though sometimes it seems what characters are saying often doesn't have much meaning, each line directly reflects the character. Each has their own way of lying to and cheating their customers, their own mannerisms and unique reactions. In other words, each character is fully realized as a three dimensional person.<br />Glengarry Glen Ross is a must-see combination of the film noir and con-men genres. It never underestimates its audience and sticks to showing you the characters rather then events. After all, people's reactions to events are often much more interesting then the events themselves. This one's highly recommended.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|Maximum of 1,000 words? Sadly, some do use this text to write a thousand words about a group that was brilliantly masterminded by one of the best producers in the business, you put two well underage teenage girls with mild talent and loud musical effects and sounds into a recording studio, pronounce them bonified lesbians, wow, you're a millionaire.<br />So I have not bothered to purchase the CD, I do listen to their music, it has a light flare to it with a modern spunk, some are still mindless to the thought of who T.A.T.U really is, thats ok, best song by them is the Nas song, most of their english is poor, I say merchandise it out like Rammestein, sing it all in Russian and German for a few years, wait it out, then sell an album in english, you've stretched out your popularity, now they'll have to resort to more risque images and clothing to sell albums by next year.<br />Oh well.<BR>Review by, Mercedes. Musical Producer. 2003
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Solid collection of Lenny's work. As with all hits collection, I could have swapped a track or two, specifically &quot;Black Velveteen&quot;  for something else from the first two albums. I also could drop &quot;American Woman&quot; for something of his, but I'm sure alot of people are glad it's here. All 5 albums are represented by at least 2 tracks, and these hits are evenly split between the big rockers, the big ballads, and a few other quality album cuts. The new track &quot;Again&quot; is also a good inclusion. The only real bummer is that each of Lenny's records have numerous non-single tracks that are sometimes better than the single's on this disc. I guess it's a good thing I have them all. Let love rule.
0451191153|1.0|Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead was a ridiculous farce that didn't spare the good sense of its readership.  I found her use of similie quite boorish and plebian.  The author is clearly of a mindset which dictates her outrageous behavoirs.  She is a product of the sub-culture which nourished her desire for world domination.  It is clear that this book is a cry for help to be removed the world in which she is forced to live by a domineering husband.  Ayn Rand's style of prose is detestable at best.  We're all less enlightened for having to read this unimaginative, unitelligable work.  Tee-Hee, hee.
B000062YAZ|2.0|Slayer's third album Reign In Blood easily ranks as one of the most overrated albums in all of metal. If there's any Sacred Cows in the genre worthy of butchering, it's this one.<br /><br />Now, before all you Slayer fanboys start piling \\"unhelpful\\" votes on this review, let me say that I don't hate your favorite band. I just have some serious issues with this particular album, and the influence it has had on metal in general. I will admit that Angel Of Death and Raining Blood are quintessential thrash songs, and Postmortem has a pretty great main riff; that Dave Lombardo is an excellent drummer; and that Rick Rubin's production is stellar (as usual). The rest....well...<br /><br />First off, RiB is completely speed-for-speed's-sake. Every damn track on this album (except Angel Of Death and Raining Blood, easily the two finest tracks on the disc) is over in about 2 minutes or less, resulting in a rather forgettable 28 minutes. Listening to songs like Piece By Piece and Jesus Saves, one can tell that there is a germ of a good song present, but it's totally glossed over in favor of more BPM. Coupled with the thin guitar sound (you won't find much \\"crunch\\" here), it's not \\"extreme,\\" just numbing and samey-sounding. Darkness Descends by Dark Angel (released a month later) pulls off similarly fast tempos, but there is a sense of dynamics and a heavier guitar sound to boot, which means it absolutely flattens your eardrums. RiB aspires to that, but can't pull it off.<br /><br />Second, Tom Araya's voice and bass playing are weak. His voice is mostly monotonal, contains little emotion, and is ofttimes unintelligible since he slurs his words trying to keep up with the music. He has a killer scream, though, but it's really only heard on Angel Of Death and a couple other songs.<br /><br />Third, Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are completely overrated guitarists. Yes, their rhythm work is all-around solid, but their solos consist of downright obnoxious trills and whammy bar abuse. An amateur guitarist could pull off this stuff after a couple months of lessons--it's not impressive, just annoying. These guys can't hold a candle to Marty Friedman or Chuck Schuldiner.<br /><br />Fourth, the lyrics are typical early Slayer, which is to say generally overly theatrical, pseudo-Satanic nonsense. However, RiB does present a turning point, where they start talking about real-life horrors (Angel Of Death, with its lyrics depicting the twisted Nazi doctor Joseph Mengele) and the hypocrisy of organized religion (Jesus Saves). They would explore those themes to better effect on later albums. Some people think that Satanism is \\"evil\\" or whatever; I just think it's a juvenile and easy way to shock your parents.<br /><br />It's too bad so many future death and thrash metal bands have tried to duplicate this album's reputation of speed and evil. The result is a genre largely composed of boring, image-obsessed soundalikes. Did RiB ruin metal? No, but its success certainly has resulted in a degree of stagnation. Moronic bands like Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, and Krisiun, I'd argue, outgrew from RiB to some extent (and the incredibly overrated Morbid Angel.. but that's another story).<br /><br />Slayer have released some solid albums--South Of Heaven and Seasons In The Abyss, the albums following RiB, are a lot more substantial. Better-developed songs, generally better riffs, more intelligent lyrical themes, better performances all around. Still not on par with the best of Metallica, Sepultura, Megadeth or even Anthrax, but solid nonetheless. RiB isn't the weakest Slayer album (that title would definitely go to the suckfest God Hates Us All). But it's still a far cry from masterpiece status.d pull off this stuff after a couple months of lessons--it's not impressive, just annoying.

B00006DEFA|5.0|I first saw \\"Amadeus\\" around 1984 when it was first released. Besides being a visual and musical masterpiece of film making, it kick-started my life-long love of and appreciation for classical music.<br />I won't repeat the story synopsis as it's already been thoroughly described both by Amazon's critical review and multiple customers here already.<br />I will say though that this edition, 'The Directors Cut', is a major improvement over the first DVD release. First, (and finally!!), the movie is now a single-side DVD...gone is the annoying 2 sided 'flipper' that the first release was. You can now watch \\"Amadeus\\" from start to finish without having to get up and turn it over. For my money, that's reason enough alone to own this new version.<br />Secondly, 'The Directors Cut' now adds about 20-30 minutes of previously deleted scenes, placed back into where they were originally intended. Personally I find some of the newer stuff enhances the story overall and fills in some details that were left vague in the original theatrical release. I won't give away any details, but there is a new scene between Mozart's wife, Constanza, and Salieri, Mozart's chief musical rival (and secret arch-enemy) early in the movie that puts an whole new perspective of Salieri's twisted and battered psyche.<br />As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are both exemplary. Included is a second disk with bonus material including interviews and making-of extras.<br />If you loved the original, you owe it to yourself to pick up this version. If you're new to classical music and Mozart, this is the best place to start.<br />lr** Feb 10,2003<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is a great CD collection.  The only aspect of Elvis' music not covered on this is the gospel music.  Yet, even though we go from Heartbreak Hotel to the last days, we don't get images of the swiveling hips, or the bloated, polyester clad Vegas act.  Instead, we hear the raw, immense talent of Elvis Aron Presley.  The 50s tracks sound just as awesome as today's artists.  He is the king of rock and roll!
0800141806|5.0|This movie shows the reality of a cruel world but full of hope and future. The fight against AIDS should not stop never. I love the performances of all cast. The theme and the way it was presented was very professional and truely. I like this movie a lot. I cry every time I see it because is so emotional and inspiring.
006092988X|5.0|This is one of my new favorite books.  It is an amazing body of work, by Betty Smith.  It was her first novel and was written in 1943.  It is the story of a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, learning the tough lessons in life under the most difficult of circumstances.  It is about living life and learning the lessons that are thrown in your path.  One of the aspects of this book is that the characters hold themselves responsible for the choices they make, good and bad, and rarely do those that love them throw their mistakes in their face.  It is about facing life in the worst situations with dignity and pride and trying to improve your situation through hardwork, education, determination and an ability to continue on and not give in, no matter what may come.  It is about a time when self reliability, hard work and family were highly valued, as opposed to an  entitlement mentality,  by those families like the Nolan's.  This is a classic American tale that will be appreciated by discerning readers.
0800141806|5.0|When I saw this movie for the first time I was 16 years old. It was shocking to me to realize the fact of been so close to the death because of AIDS. I cried like a child with the movie and understood how society is so cruel and cold with other people just because they think or act different. This movie shows the reality of life in it's maximum expression. I've seen this movie like 10 times and always make me cry, think and smile of happiness for those who are just... HUMANS like everybody, else!
B000084T18|5.0|Oh man is this album hot!! Especially tracks 2 and 6. What Up Gangsta is just what 50 cent is made for and High All The Time is just plain sweet. That chorus is soo awesome. Then of course there's In Da Club which you gotta just love. \\"Go shorty, its ur birthday\\" haha love it, sorry. ANYWAY, Many Men is also awesome, i'll never get sick of that chorus. Back Down is sort of way too hard beated and doesnt really match 50 cent. More like Nappy Roots style maybe. Speaking of style, I also love Like My Style, especially the background beat throughout the song. Blood hound is weird and song 3 has Eminem. I think so does 15. I also like, If i cant, do it, my homie it cant be done!! (and ima make the champagne bottle pop, ima take it to the top, to show i can make it stop, baby...) sorry again. Heat is boring.  Poor Lil Rich is boring. P.I.M.P. sounds like some sorta hawaiin or jamaican song with that tune. And the other two songs are also boring. But the rest, GREAT!! BUY IT NO MATTER WHAT!!!
B000084T18|4.0|a force jay and ja-rule watch your back he seems to be legit
B000075BFK|5.0|Man dont even think about giving this album less than 5 stars. Cause if you do than your just crazy. The best song on this cd is Fair XChange. Oh man this songs hot, the chorus especially of course. And Still Ballin' is also hot especially that hard chorus. When We Ride on our Enemies is just kinda boring cause there's a long pause between each chorus \\"whatevertheycallits\\". Changed Man is awesome too, from start to finish. F*** Em All is boring and those words hardly appear anyway. Never B Peace is cool, but it has a quiet chorus. Tracks 7, 8, and 9 are all kinda boring too so forget them. Late Night is weird, but fun. Ghetto Star is also awesome enough and Thugz Mansion on cd1 is AWESOME! On cd2 my favorite is once again track 10, There U Go. That chorus is just like woooah cool! And I LOVE Catchin Feelings! I think his voice is best in that song. Military Minds is also fun, but kinda long. This Life I Lead is also very very awesome. Better Dayz has a VERY dull chorus. Listen to it and you may fall asleep. Fame is ok and so is U Can Call. I dont like the My Block remix has good as the first one but its still pretty awesome. Since I, um, sorta have the burned version, I dont have the last two tracks. But the cd is hot, and even the kinda boring ones are definitely worth listening to!!
B000084T18|5.0|Great Album. Just bought it.<BR>50 cents is the next big thing thanks to Em and Dre. Track 4 is the best one.
0440237688|4.0|This was a very interesting read, despite the extremely simple language Lowry used, as it is on a relatively low reading level.  The Giver appeared to be used as a tool to point out things in our society that we take for granted and also to show what life would be like if we were to try to create the world in this book.  Many people dislike pain, however Lowry shows through The Giver that pain is a necessary evil of life and something that cannot just be done away with.  She indirectly shows the importance of differences in our lives.  Another very important aspect is the reader's shock when he/she comes across things and ideas that are expected in this fictional world, but happen to be the characters had never heard of.  The Giver is, in my opinion, a very good book with many different levels and should not only be read a younger age but also by older readers so that the full value and concept of the book can be understood.  Lowry presents a very important message about our society and culture and the dangers of assimilation in a very unique way.  Although I feel that the ending could have been far better, for there were so many things the author could have done, I believe it was an overall well-written book.
B000002GFT|5.0|&quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; was Fairport Convention's fourth album and represented the group's transformation from a rock band with a love of folk music to a group that reinterpreted traditional English songs.  You will only find one original song on this album, &quot;Come All Ye&quot; by Sandy Denny and Ashley Hutchings, who were already on their way out the door when this 1969 album was being recorded.  The rest are traditional English folk songs, but done with gorgeous harmonies backed by a splendid mix of acoustic and electric guitars that suddenly made this type of music artistically and commercially viable.  It is hard to pick favorites from this album because everything on it sounds great.  At the moment I like &quot;Reynardine,&quot; &quot;Matty Groves,&quot; &quot;Farewell Farewell&quot; and &quot;Tam-Lin&quot; the best, but ask me again next week and you will probably get a different album.  Fairport Convention was never really popular on this side of the pond, but few groups anyway could match their singing or their instrumentation (think of them as a mix of the Mamas &amp; the Papas with the Byrds for a rough idea) and with Sandy Denny on lead vocals they had the pre-eminent British folk-rock singer of her generation.  Consequently, there is something of an understandable bias towards the work of Fairport Convention during this early period, although the signature sound they developed on &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; would be continued for well over another decade by the group's new lineup.
0446677450|5.0|Initially may come across as a bit elementary (if you have had basic exposure to accounting), but picks up very quickly.  Kiyosaki makes quite a few basic and extremely valid points that we can easily overlook when managing our day-to-day finances.  Also provides insight on great investing ideas that the average investor would not necessarily think of.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to get a better grasp on their finances.  I am going to purchase another one of his books right now.
B00007KWHP|5.0|I purchased this album after I bought THE VERY BEST OF YES and I Must say that this was a much better cd in that the songs were clearly outside of the pop-realm with the exception of roundabout. Cans and Brahms is a killer track for lack of a better term. I liked South Side of the Sky and Heart of the Sunrise. Those two songs make the cd in my opinion but the other songs are great. Any fan of YES should have this album!
0930289234|5.0|Comic books were never &quot;just for kids&quot; as anyone familiar with a lot of EC titles already knows, but the censors in America, with their &quot;Comic Codes Authority&quot; had long made it difficult for more mature titles to surface before Alan Moore, Frank Miller and others popped up. This book is an awesome melding of &quot;typical superhero&quot; fiction with a dystopian twist. The characters have flaws, scars and varying intentions, which makes them more three dimensional than many other &quot;superheroes&quot;. By the late eighties, many others had followed the trend of darker and more mature themes in the comic medium. Even Batman was affected by this trend, obviously fitting in with the film noir elements already inherent in the series. This book is one of my favorite books period, and is entertaining and contains more twists than a whole season of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;. I recommend to any fan of the modern &quot;Dc Vertigo&quot; type comics for a glimpse at the very exciting start of the &quot;Suggested for mature readers&quot; modern comic book movement.

B000084T18|5.0|Other than the intro, there aren't any tracks you can really skip on this album. This album has the best production i've seen in long time in a rap album. 50 cent is the future, plain and simple.
0440237688|4.0|In a futuristic society where individuality is suppressed to be virtually non-existent, a young boy tests the limits of conformity. \\"Selected\\" to be the new Receiver of the community, Jonas begins to understand the hypocrisy and deceit his entire life has been based on, and the realization that maybe the \\"perfect\\" community was lacking some things that were essential to life. Jonas' story is a defiant struggle of the self versus the masses, in which one young boy will strive to maintain that which he holds dear. The Giver is an excellent story of a Utopian society that is perhaps not all its cracked up to be. Although based on a middle school reading level, the story contains ideas that can be re-examined over and over again. The Giver is a truly brilliant and insightful work about the evils of conformity.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I have seen most of Miyazaki's films, and this by far is the best to date! Ever see a film that you simply cannot stop thinking about? This film stayed with me for weeks afterward, it kept me thinking, it made me wish I was 10 again. <br />I kept wondering why I was one of four people in our theatre -- what a waste! The world has missed out on this gem, don't pass up this DVD.
B000009RNM|5.0|This excellent compilation draws from the albums The Man Who Sold The World, Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, Pin-Ups, Aladdinsane, Diamond Dogs and his opus magnum Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars. It thus provides some of his best work with producer Tony Visconti plus a wide variety of different musical styles. There's the wistful pop of Space Oddity and Starman, the pre-punk aggro of Jean Genie (supposedly written about Iggy Pop), the anthemic rock of Rebel Rebel, the 60s pop of Sorrow and Oh You Pretty Things (This was a hit for Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits in 1971). There's also the heavy rock of Man Who Sold The World (a hit for Lulu in the late 1960s) and All The Young Dudes (a hit for Mott The Hoople in 1973), the bleak ballad Drive-In Saturday, his fast and aloof interpretation of Let's Spend The Night Together and the phenomenal and breathtaking Life On Mars with its gripping arrangement and poetic lyrics. Other favorites of mine include the catchy Prettiest Star and Changes with its interesting wordplay, plus the magnificent Diamond Dogs with its howling hound sounds. The choice of tracks is highly intelligent and although these things are always subjective, I do for once agree with the selection of the compilers. Of course, Bowie had a novelty hit in 1973, The Laughing Gnome, but it would have been out of place on this album so I won't complain of the omission, and it was recorded long before 1969. Bowie's early work has stood the test of time very well. These are all strong, melodic songs that still evoke vivid images and emotions. This album well and truly deserves its five stars.
6304259093|1.0|Okay, you're asking me, \\"why did you give a Crow movie a 1?\\"<br />well, all I can say about it is that it [stunk]. There was one fighting scene, and that really didn't live up to all the \\"fighting for justice\\" thing that The Crow set for the rest of them. and the follow up, trying to stay in the spotlight of the first was tacky. It was alright, but it really didn't follow the realness of The Crow. I didn't really take to Ash anyway. I could more relate to Eric. <br />There was also the fact of there was a bit too much information when it came to the clubs. And they really didn't have to add some of the things at the end. I didn't like it. [sorry for the spoilers there...]<br />It's not just because I am a major Brandon Lee fan, and I know no one can beat an original, but I know that Vincent Perez was almost there in the whole thing about walking in his shadow and succeeding, but he wasn't quite there.<br />*Shrugs~ so maybe you have a different opinion, but this is mine.
B0000640S2|4.0|Rambo 2 is a terrible movie if taken seriously. However, it is entertaining if viewed as a comedy. Sly Stallone delivers another 5 star performance that was really snubbed of an Oscar nomination. This film revolves around Lt. John Rambo whupping some bad guys and rescuing some POW's. Throw in helicopters, explosions, guns, and Russians and you've got yourself an excellent little picture.<br />This film's finest hour is when Rambo takes to the sky in an Apache and rains death down upon the jungle and anyone who might be in it. I'm getting excited just thinking about it. In closing, this movie is simply too good to pass up.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|A sublime and remarkable meditation on sin, salvation and, especially, death in a highly unlikely package - covers of The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode and other unlikely artists. This should be a disaster.  Instead it is a masterpiece.  There is serious alchemy happening here. Johnny Cash transmutes the base metal of these familiar pop tunes into precious musical ore.
6304711905|5.0|This somewhat cult classic has attained its status for a few reasons. Firstly, Val Kilmer is excellent as Doc Holliday. His performance is extremely entertaining and will no doubt stick with the viewer for years. Kilmer's Holliday delivers countless classic lines and a few memorable moments such as his cup swinging antics in response to one of the film's bad guys.<br />Kurt Russell and the rest of the cast also deliver good performances in this film which centers around Wyatt Earp and the town of Tombstone. While this movie may not be histroically accurate, it is one of the best action films of the 90's and very much worth a viewing.
0316666343|2.0|I would have to agree with the lady from Texas--this book isn't really that great.  Agree that the beginning is interesting but unfortunately it just doesn't keep you moving.  I'm surprised it is doing that well because I had to push myself to keep reading it and I eventually gave up and read the ending; wasn't impressed.  I'd take a pass on this one.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|&quot;Memento&quot; is an interesting film that toys with the ideas of time, memory, and indentity. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man who can no longer create new memories after suffering an injury to the head. Only the tattoos on his body and the few people left in his life remain as reminders of his true self.<br />The plot unfolds both backwards and forwards as Leonard tries to piece together his life. Joe Pantoliano is excellent as Lenny's acquaintance and Pearce himself also delivers a memorable performance. Fans of films like &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, &quot;LA Confidential&quot;, and perhaps even &quot;Fight Club&quot; will appreciate the suspensful plot and witty humor of &quot;Memento&quot;.
B00005JM6E|5.0|The 1939 version of The Four Feathers with Clements et al is a masterpiece in more ways than one. I believe that this version describes vividly an era and a disposition of class consciousness that is not seen today. Faversham boldly goes it alone clearly not for recognition, but for honor and to support his fellow officers. So, we see a man tested to his mettle, and without all those special effects which detract from solid character acting, and a good plot. The old general however \\"takes the cake\\" in his repeated version of the battle at Balaclava, clearly he won the battle all by himself, one could imagine him in real life not only as a good storyteller, but one who is fiercly loyal to his cause and his men. A absolutely fabulous tale, which richly deserves the honor of being put on to DVD...PW. Oxnard California.
0452281881|5.0|I think I have reread this book 4 times since initially reading it almost 2 years ago. I don't think I've enjoyed a book this much in a very long time. A must read for anyone who has ever, or will ever work in an office setting. Suddenly I look at my coworkers in a whole new way :).
0066620996|4.0|With all and much due respect to the other reviewers, specifically those with backgrounds in data research and business owners taking a negative lean on Good to Great concepts, I think they've missed both the point and the appeal of this piece. This book does what many fail to do, it takes the touchy-feely ideals of people oriented structure and, for the very first time, supports them with pure data. Other books either take the strong dollar line describing how to logically move money from one place to another to make more money or go the complete opposite, describing how to be one with the universe and perfectly in tune with your failing business. OHM! <br />Sure, I'll be the first one to agree that the data herein may not be processed to the point of mathematical certainties, but that is simply the nature of the assertions it is trying to make. This book looks into the past, it searches for the data, rather than telling me how to better run a business in the future with no explanation as to why I should say \\"bless you\\" every time an employee sneezes. Good To Great shows how the compassionate in balance with the passionate is not just the guru of the week's feel-good cliché, but a methodology that CAN work. Mr. Collins does not seem to assert, at all, that these methods WILL work. Instead he and his team have virtually proven that a construct more in tune with the people can be a staggering money maker. <br />I think the problem with this book is the crowd to which it appeals. Frankly, it is hard to imagine anyone apart from a business owner, a wanna-be business owner, or a statistician ever pulling it off the shelf. As such, these are the very people who will most easily scoff at the findings as they are probably part of the problem. If one is already increasing his/her profit margin solely via massive layoffs, of course s/he is not going to agree with sticking things out over time, changing people's positions, or cutting his/her own salary. Your method is working in the short term. Blame the data, blame the conclusions if you will. The little nugget of gold, to me, is that Good to Great shows that a dedicated, but employee friendly structure, CAN make as much doe as the big guns. It has completely blown away the idea that the hard line is the way things must be done.<BR> <BR>If you are a potential reader who is NOT looking for the SECRET of running a business and who is NOT looking to refute the SECRET of running a business, the issues demonstrated herein are very rewarding. Collins essentially compares several companies that were maintaining a good status quo before skyrocketing and holding the orbit for 15 years to as many other companies poised in the same position, but which failed to do the same. The data often referenced in the text is droves of articles published about these companies during the times of the skyrocket. Sounds dry to your everyday reader, but when stretched out end to end, the results are quite compelling. Unlike what is written by other reviewers, the conclusions are not simple matters of getting the right people in the right place at the right time. Rather, they are often proof that counter-corporate concepts and actually losing money while these more human concepts take shape can result in yielding enough revenue to throw down with the big boys. I don't know about you, but every time I see a person second guessing their technique or approach to life because Joe Corporate makes more money quicker, it pains me. Joe Corporate has actual data to harvest. His numbers yield numbers making everything easy to see. Doesn't make him any more personable. Finally the people people of the world have data to support their own processes without hard liners thinking them foolish. <BR>Essentially, this book is top line because it is HOW to go from good to great, not WHAT it takes to make the leap. A WHAT is easily disproved. Yet, there can be a million HOWs. This is one of them. <br />Be forewarned, as the set ofcompanies examined are often rehashed to illustrate the conclusions to each chapter, the read gets a tad repetitive if you are not focused. Other than that, however, it is an easy read, common speak. There is no Mr. Hawking to this book, just a buddy who did the work for you.
B00005A1PR|5.0|In world full of songs about sex, money, and cars, it is refreshing to hear someone like India sing about things that actually matter in life: life, health, happiness, love, and God.  R&b has become so trite nowadays that it's like when you listen to one song, you've listened to them all.  But not with India.  Her voice is so beautiful and calming and she uses it effortlessly on the songs on this album.  The best songs are \\"Brown Skin,\\" \\"Nature,\\" \\"Simple,\\" \\"Ready for Love,\\" and \\"Always in My Head.\\"  India's music makes you sit back, think, and appreciate all the good things in your life.  If you want to get away from all the \\"bling bling\\" and baby-mama-drama plaguing contemporary r&b, come give India a listen.
B000002UAI|5.0|I give this CD 5 Stars because all of the Beatles CDs get 5 Stars.  Most especially those that were released as albums while the group was still intact.  I just wanted to weigh in against all those who consider Mister Moonlight the worst Beatle song ever. You have got to be kidding. Lennon does a great job of singing, and the boys harmony is very good as well.  I'm not crazy about the organ break in the middle...but it is still the Beatles. let's set the record straight.  The worst Beatle song ever is Revolution 9 on the White Album.  I love the Beatles, and I love John Lennon...but that is the worst 8 minutes ...they ever put onto tape and released. I have tried hard to listen to it and appreciate Lennon's genius.  But Rev 9 is junk. So let's leave Mister Moonlight alone. <br />This CD has great songs.  My favorites are No Reply, I'll Follow The Sun, Eight days a Week, Every little Thing, and Look What You're Doing. I love \\"Words of Love\\" as well, but I take some points off only because it was written by Buddy Holly and not one of the Beatles.<br />My favorite Beatles CDs are Help, Rubber Soul and Abbey Road. And the slice of Abbey Road from \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" through \\"The End\\" is the greatest slice of rock music ever recorded.  Do yourself a favor.  Buy Beatles Fos Sale.  Listen to it 10 times.  And then buy all the other Beatle CDs.  You won't regret the decision.
B0000039PW|5.0|With this single release, \\"Ready to Die,\\" Biggie cemented his place as absolutely, without a doubt, the sickest lyricist to date.  Just listen to \\"respect\\".  This track alone is enough to make Biggie my favorite rapper of all time.  Unlike the supremely talented artists of today (Eminem, Andre of Outkast, etc...), Biggie can tell a story with coherent ease without using lyrical \\"gimmicks\\" to get the listener hooked.  It is Biggie's genuine sincerity added to the over-the-top skills that makes him untouchable.
B00005JLF5|4.0|Of course the series is great im not going to get into that here on this review on the dvd.<br />The case for season 1 is kind of a let down as opposed to the star trek TNG dvd box sets ( nice silver case with nice box inside housing the episodes ) its a see through but i have to admit it stays shut better than the TNG case and the dvds are much easier to get to.  Also something i do not like is that the deep space 9 dvd set did NOT include a booklet i think this is a must for all series dvd box sets.  However Deep Space 9 has some very nice graphics on the dvds ( each one has different graphics unlike tng's rather bland mix of colors )<br />8 out of 10 for box<br />The image quality is about the same as tng season 7 ( noise becomes apparent from the first episode however around disc 4 and 5 the picture quality has improved a good bit. It is also full frame.  I;ll give this dvd a 7 out of 10 for video<br />The audio on this dvd is simply amazing.  You actually feel thier while watching the dvds ( nice 5.1 audio ) audio gets a 9.5 out of 10<br />The Menus are very nice and well thoughout and much crisper.  Trek fans will find the menus simlar to the ones the computer sys uses on the show. 8 out of 10 on menu design.<br />Last but not least the Extras!  This box set gives us a full dvd full of extra's ( disc 6 ) the quality on these are very nice and extra's are always welcomed.<br />Anyway have to jet now wheather you are a sci-fi fan or a treky or someone looking to pass their time with a series This is a great dvd ( get it when it hits retail for 100 instead of the retial of 150 or you will kick yourself! ) and its worth checking into.
0553274503|5.0|I read Flowers for Algernon, which is on the banned book list.  I was intrigued to find out why.  When I finished the book, I still couldn't figure out why it is on that list.  The book is about a man in his thirties named Charly who is mentally challenged.  He undergoes an amazing operation to try to raise his I. Q.  Well, it works, but perhaps it wasn't such a good idea.  He begins to realize that the people who he thought were his friends were actually very cruel to him because of his disability.  You don't have to dig very deep to notice that the book is about self-realization and knowing yourself.  This tear-jerking novel inspired me to try to be a better person and make sure that I keep track of myself.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I must say that I am pleased to see that there are others in the universe, like myself, that enjoyed this show or grew to enjoy this show. I was impressed with the pilot episode and thought it had some great potential. Well, in my opinion, it exceeded its potential and became my favorite of all the Trek shows to date. Though, I only became a consistent viewer of the show at the beginning of its fourth season, I intend to get all the seasons of DS9 on DVD and go back to watch episodes from the 2nd and 3rd seasons. I felt that the writing and charachter development did make the show a huge success. As the others have already stated, it also displayed awesome story archs too. Seasons 4-7 were the best in my opinion and I was truly saddened to see the show end in its seventh and final season. I still have hopes that Paramount decides to take this series to the big screen. There is great story telling left for the major charachters of this show in my opinion. <br />Again, its great to see that there are other DS9 fans out there besides myself that are just as excited as I am about the release of this show on DVD.

B000084T18|5.0|He's been an underground mixtape champion for over 2 years.  His entrance into the game is the most anticipated since Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac.  All the hype is worth it!  The CD bangs from beginning to end.  Phat tracks include &quot;Patiently Waiting,&quot; the banger &quot;In Da Club,&quot; &quot;Heat,&quot; &quot;Back Down,&quot; &quot;Don't Push Me&quot; and &quot;Gotta Make It To Heaven.&quot; 50 Cent may not be the most positive artist and the production may not break any new ground.  However, 50 is a lyrical giant!  It's hip hop at it's finest!
0679736646|5.0|From about the mid-60's to mid-70's PKD was really in his element, delivering his greatest novels of bizarre mind-expanding futures. While some of his earlier and later works are bogged down by preachiness or a lack of focus, *Ubik* is one of PKD's sure classics, along with *A Scanner Darkly* and others from around the same time. Here we have a world in which psychic and anti-psychic people battle for supremacy in a cutthroat corporate environment, and this battle extends to the world of death as well. Characters try to determine if they're alive or dead while time collapses around them. Holding everything together in its own weird way is a strange product called Ubik, which is clearly PKD's commentary on brand name products and saturation marketing. The uncommon term \\"entropic fiction\\" applies to this novel and a few other of its ilk by a variety of writers, in which time and society degenerate into disorder - but not necessarily chaos, just a different state of reality. Like the best of PKD's mindbending works, just read this and then spend some time removing the entropy from your thoughts.
B000084T18|5.0|This album is the hottest thing out there now. They ain't nuttin worth skippin ahead on this album, no filler. We all been waitin for 50 Cent to drop dis thing, and it was worth the wait. ...
B00007DWRZ|5.0|A lovely little album!  The band's name and all-star cast are an apparent tribute to the Veloso-Gil-Bethania-Costa mid-1970s supergroup, Doce Barbaros (The Sweet Barbarians), but in this case the musicians, neo-tropicalistas Arnaldo Antunes, Carlinhos Brown and Marisa Monte, go for tender restraint, rather than wild excess.  It's a remarkably gentle, dreamy album, with an interesting blend of voices and styles.  If I had to characterize it, I'd say this sounds more like an Arnaldo Antunes album than anything else, with its off-kilter sensibility and unhurried style.  Monte, who put this album out on her own Phonomotor label, plays the central vocal part, though, with both Antunes and Brown complimenting her in unusual harmony parts.  Carlinhos seems a little lost in the mix, at least his former trademark Afro-Brazilian percussion is hardly as prominent as on other albums.  All in all, this is a very pleasant, inventive and multi-textured record, well worth checking out!
B00007LL7O|2.0|Kotipelto signs great as usual, but...the record is way too artistic. There's too much choral singing and too little brutal force and uncontrolled passion from their early days. For new listeners: buy some old record like Visions or Infinite.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|...this compilation is a bit Paul-heavy. Now I understand this is only supposed to include their &quot;number one&quot; songs, but I am a mystified as to what the qualifications were for inclusion. <BR>&quot;Please Please Me,&quot; historically referred to as their first number one isn't here. Ditto &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; which was the other half of a double-A sided single with &quot;Penny Lane.&quot; Maybe I'm being paranoid but it seems the living half of Lennon-McCartney, especially in light of his latest obnoxious behavior, may have had something to do with those omissions. <br />Be that as it may, it is an excellent entree into the Beatles catalogue, which is unmatched in the annals of pop music.
B00005JL96|5.0|I saw this in the theater with my children and knew we'd have to own it.  Since others have summarized the plot and characters, I thought I'd reflect on what makes this film so special.  The real charm of this film lies in how flawed *all* of its characters are.  That, I know, is a big &quot;minus&quot; for parents who only want their children exposed to good fictional role models, but I totally disagree.  We all feel flawed at a fundamental level, and the challenge is to rise above that to create goodness in the world.  Lilo is a bully, Stitch is a monster, and Nani is out of her league when is comes to parenting her little sister.  Still, they (and other misfits) take what they have to offer to create a family and a home.
B00004Y5A8|5.0|This is certainly an interesting collection of songs! I can't say I love DISC 1 in general, but there are some nice surprises. \\"Kooks\\" is a lovely little song! The band playing with Bowie is quite good in \\"The Width Of A Circle\\" and \\"Unwashed And Somewhat Slightly Dazed.\\" I heavily prefer Disc 2 because I have loved the \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" material for many years. The familiar songs sound different but as enjoyable as the released versions. Bowie was great at reworking good songs into even better songs, which is quite apparent on \\"I'm Waiting For The Man\\" and \\"White Light/White Heat.\\"  I can't say enough positive things about Disc 2 other than \\"Freak out, in a Moonage Daydream! Oh yeah!\\"
B00008DDSC|5.0|Okay, the actual dvd isn't available yet, I've just pre-ordered mine.  Anyway, if you love BDSM, then I think you'll love this movie.  It's a great movie to watch with your sub, Dom, Top, or bottom.  I think it tends to speak more to the younger crowd, but don't let that stop you.  I attended a showing of this movie a few months ago, and am happy to see it is finally available for purchase.  I'm not a big movie buyer, but this was on my list of \\"Worth Owning\\".
0553274503|1.0|Having read Flowers for Algernon I wouldnt recommend this book to anybody unless you like slow and not exciting books. The human expirement that the doctors do is really not interesting at all. Personally I can not stand any books that dont have any adventure or are interesting and this book falls in this catagory. At first when reading this book it I was hoping it would start getting interesting, but of course it didnt and never had a good part. So unless you have tons of patience and like boring books you dont want to read this book.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Perhaps the most underrated of British blues guitarists, Robin Trower is also one of the very few to completely master the uniquely American blues techniques of \\"bend\\" and \\"wobble\\". Add this to a razor-sharp acuity for developing tone poetry, an excellent couple of bandmates (James Dewar's dependable bass and dark, dramatic vocal stylings with Reg Isidore's rock-solid backbeats)and a musical mind obviously steeped in late-60s British psychedelic blues and you have all you need for a rock and roll milestone; that is exactly what this recording represents.  From crashing machine-gun opening chords and time-signature-banding arrangements through eerie windy sound effects the songs share dark themes like confusion, abandonment, hopelessness and the post-hippie emptiness of youth emerging from a drug-induced stupor to find wrecked relationships and a bleak future.  Long a staple of album rock radio, tunes like \\"Day of the Eagle\\", the chilling title track, \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\" and \\"Fool and Me\\" have been standards practically since this record's release.  Combining crafty writing with virtuoso performances -- Trower's guitar alternately shrieks in panic and moans in agony, twining itself around Dewar's heavy, husky, almost Gothic vocals -- this is, in my opinion, the definitive recording of certainly one of the best British bluesmen.  An absolute must-own for fans of great guitar records.  The re-mastered tracks featured on this record appear to my ears indistinguishable from the previously released \\"re-mastered\\" two-record set that includes this album plus it's brilliant, if more \\"basic blues\\" predecessor, \\"Twice Removed From Yesterday\\".  And the bonus live performance tracks on this cd, while interesting, do not substantially vary from the studio tracks.  Still, in whatever form you acquire this recording, JUST DO IT!  Crank up the old lava lamp, partake of your favorite herbal refreshment and immerse yourself in one of the few \\"psychedelic\\" recordings that has withstood the test of time to emerge as a true classic.
B00003CXAW|5.0|The original King Kong is by far still the best movie of its type to this day. The terrific and exciting fight scenes between the creatures even today has not been surpassed. Nothing that Spielburg has done has reached the genius of Merian Cooper. When one considers that these scenes were done without the use of computer or animation but used stop action photography and 18\\" models, genius IS the only way to describe their efforts! And the scenes of the Ape destroying the village and New York are horrific and tremendous film making! The action is riveting! Dialog is a little corny but fun! \\"I've never seen it fail, some hard-boiled egg gets a look at a pretty face and wham! He crack's up and goes sappy on me!\\" \\"Don't be alarmed! Those chains are made of chromium steel!\\" \\"Well, Denum, looks like the planes got'em.\\" \\"No, It was beauty that killed the beast!\\"<br />Supurb film from beginning to end. And Fay Wray has the BEST scream in movie history. It is still used today on soundtracks!<BR>No one's done it better!<br />This film fits the classical form of a Greek tradgety. FANTASTIC!
B00005LMBK|2.0|this cd was one of the the first cd's that i purchased instead of burned. I kind of made a mistake purchasing this cd because someone told me it was a rock cd and i thought well hey the cover of the band looks cool so off i went and bought it. When i listened to it i thought it was ok and there where some great rap songs like clint eastwood which is a vicious rap song and then you have sound check which is a great song with great scratchings which sounds a bit spooky. Another great rap song is rock the house which is a very bluesy rap song, and then you have the song 19/2000 which is a great song which makes you feel like goin to the beach and yes it is a good song to listen to on the beach but then the rest of the songs are kind of like country music. So yes this album was kind of a mistake but turned out not bad so if you like techno, rap, jazz, blues, and even country, well then this album is for you. This is propbably one of the most alternative albums i have ever heard of. Some people think there is pure rock on the cd but i don't believe them because i am a very big rock lover and the only rock song which is more punk but any way is the called *punk*. So yeah its a good enough album if you like the types of music in this album that i just mentioned. <br />heres what what kind of music each song would suit.<br />1.rehash-soft rock, country<BR>2.5/4-similair to punk rock<BR>3.tomorow comes today-soft rock, country<BR>4.new genious-techno, folk<BR>5.clint eastwood-vicious rap<br />6.man research-techno<BR>7.punk-punk<BR>8.sound check-techno<BR>9.double bass-soft rock<BR>10.rock the house-jazz, soft rap<BR>11.19/2000-techno<BR>12.latin simone-latin<BR>13.starshine-soft rock<BR>14.slow country-soft rock<BR>15.m1a1-punk<BR>16.dracula-techno<BR>17.left hand suzuki method-techno<br />if you like the techno on this album get moby, if you like the soft rock, punk get weezer, though if you love the rapping/jazz rnb get del the funkee homosapien or dr octagon.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Much like it is impossible to read a review of The Strokes without the obligatory Velvet Underground remark, when discussing the latest American rock buzz band, Interpol, it is mandatory to reference goth-rock legends Joy Division.  The common threads, angular guitar riffs, foreboding bass lines, hyper-kinetic drumming and yearning vocals, are obvious.  But upon further review, Interpol's debut CD Turn on the Bright Lights also reveals influences like early Psychedelic Furs, Kitchens of Distinction and the Pixies.  Comparisons with this band are inevitable, plentiful and even detrimental (hey: Jackie Childs might sue me for that line) when they are pigeon holed as retro knock-offs, but Interpol's work can proudly stand alone.  And while the forecast for a Joy Division song was always mostly cloudy with a chance of doom, there seems to be light at the end of the Interpol tunnel.  Not to say they make shinny, happy music because they don't.  The band certainly wears their pensive, inner turmoil on their sleeve, and they have the emotional urgency reminiscent of Joy Division, but the soundscapes aren't as stark, cold and barren.<br />In fact they begin with the understated and sullen, \\"Untitled.\\"  And while \\"Obstacle 1\\" has a nervous energy and maniacal lyrics (\\"stabbing yourself in the neck\\"), it is countered with the dazzling, \\"NYC\\" that, with lyrics like \\"New York cares,\\" seemingly was written as some sort of post 9/11 tribute.  The single, \\"PDA\\" got virtually zero commercial radio airplay and gets a few random spins on MTV2, yet it is already a cult favorite.  \\"Roland\\" is a pure pogo-stick slam-dance throwback, whereas \\"Hands Away,\\" \\"The New\\" and \\"Leif Erikson\\" all have a restrained, albeit brooding calmness.<br />Interpol hails from Brooklyn, NY and completed their line-up in 1998 and has had success, not surprisingly across the pond.  Beginning with tours of clubs in NYC in 2000, they completed a short run of UK dates with a performance on BBC broadcasting icon John Peele's radio show in April of 2001.  That is the ultimate in a 3rd party endorsement.  In producing such an impressively polished debut, it will be interesting to see how their career unfolds.   <br />Raised on what is now considered classic 80s British alternative (The Smiths, Echo & The Bunnymen, New Order) and American indie veterans (Sonic Youth, Luna, Pavement), there seems to be an interesting melding of styles amongst today's wave of stateside rock hopefuls including Detroit's White Stripes and the second most famous band out of Portland, OR, The Dandy Warhols.  Drawing from British punk and American jangle-pop with a healthy dose of distortion, there are finally new bands that are a welcomed break from the painfully pedestrian dreck of Creed, Matchbox 20, Puddle of Mudd, Nickleback et al.  After just one disc, Interpol deserves a place at the-what should we call this group-Bramerican? Briterican? round table. Never mind, scratch that last thought.  ...
B000002U82|5.0|At the age of fourteen I discovered Pink Floyd's movie The Wall.  Having never knowingly heard any of their music, I watched the movie with some friends because we heard it was 'trippy.'  Immediately I began saving my money so that I could buy both the album and the video.  What this led me into should be familiar with many fans of Pink Floyd.  I started buying their albums.  All of them.  Many of them I had to buy twice because they got worn out or lost.  Once I bought a second copy of Meddle while on a family vacation even though I knew exactly where my other copy was at home.  I just couldn't wait till we got home to hear it again.  <br />I've owned at least one copy of Dark Side on tape, CD, and vinyl.  Recently I found this on LP, along with Abbey Road, and began to rediscover two of my favorite bands.  Both the Beatles and Pink Floyd (especially on Dark Side) are masters of vocal arrangements.  Abbey Road and Dark Side (both recorded at Abbey Road Studios) demonstrate the bands' abilities to bring out the richness inherent in their songs through vocal harmony and lush instrumental arrangements.  Yada yada yada...<br />I imagine anyone who reads this is already familiar with this album, so we're just sharing our appreciation (if you're not familiar, well.. it's never too late)..  For me, the greatest thing about this album is that it transports me somewhere..  It takes me back to 1973, three years before I came to be.. It takes me to the beginning and ending of time.. It takes me to outer space.. It takes me on a trip through my own mind..  <br />Lovely.. Absolutely lovely.. If you don't know it, you just don't know..
B00006JIAF|5.0|The Strokes.  More than just five drunk guys playing music.  Ok, so that's the way it seems at first, but as you listen, there really is more to it.<BR>They are very talented.  Yes, they do have influences from other bands, but who doesn't?<BR>All in all, they have an original sound that is very unique and stands out among the pop crap that is out in the world today.<BR>The Strokes are a refreshing whiff of air that isn't like the rest.  It's nice to hear something different than the same old.<BR>Sure, there are other bands out at the moment, but I think that when you look over them all, The Strokes just stand out.<BR>I think, in my opinion, that we will be hearing more from them soon, and hopefully they will go up rather than down.
0151008116|5.0|I don't usually pick up a book that has won a serious prize as I tend to think that they are too intellectual and too deep for me but the few words on the back cover caught my attention. I wasn't hooked immediately but was soon after Pi boarded his Noah's Ark. I felt like I was riding a wave of emotions as I accompanied Pi through his long struggle to survive. I felt his fear for Richard Parker and his triumph when the whistle he blew conquered Richard Parker. I could feel his joy and his misery of the downpours of rain and the scorching of the midday sun. The book is a wealth of discovery. How do you fish in the middle of the ocean? How do you know how to eat a turtle? How do you catch the rain? Not a book for the fainthearted though nor for vegetarians. The description of death of the zebra was not a pretty sight. And as for Pi salivating for the taste of Richard Parker's excrement, I must admit I was fascinated to find out Pi's degustation. A very original book which I would highly recommend!
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent is awesome.  His CD is the best one I've heard in a long time.  This will definitely be one of the top albums of 2003.  Dr. Dre mixed some awesome beats for this album.  Eminem also adds some flavor to this album with his appearances on &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot; and &quot;Don't Push Me.&quot;  50 is by far the best artist on Shady/Aftermath.  The best songs on this album are What Up Gangsta, Patiently Waiting, In Da Club, If I Can't, Blood Hound, Back Down, &amp; Don't Push Me.  The only song that needs some work is High All The Time.  But every song is good in its own way.  If your looking for a good album or if you like Eminem and Dre, then 50 Cent is the album for you.  Also pick up 50 Cent's earlier albums with the G-Unit, who are also tight a** rappers.  50 Cent is blowin up!
0805017445|5.0|My youngest son has loved the Brown Bear board book since he was about 9 months old. Now at 19 months, it is still his favorite book despite the fact that he probably has over 100 others. We have memorized the text but he continues to loves to look at the illustrations.  He also likes, \\"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?\\" but it's definitely his second choice.  We have used both books to begin learning colors, animal names, and the sounds that animals make. I only wish the board books were bigger!
B00005RY7X|5.0|In a time of too much crap rap, this album brings back rock.  Simple lyrics, 80's style guitar riffs and harmonic chorus lines.  Sure some of the songs sound the same but for those fools who have time to write long reviews to mock this, go listen to your Michael Bolton CD's.  SHE IS BEAUTIFUL!
B000002U8H|5.0|For many people, Pink Floyd starts with Dark Side of the Moon, some people acknowledge Piper At the Gates of Dawn, but overlook excellent pre-DSOTM albums like Atom Heart Mother and this one, Meddle.  This is the album that shows the first true example of the &quot;Pink Floyd sound,&quot; and that comes through on the album's epic closer &quot;Echoes.&quot;  As a fairly new but educated Floydhead, I can safely say that Meddle is an album not to be ignored.<br />The album's opener, &quot;One of These Days,&quot; is arguably the heaviest track in the Floyd catalogue.  The song, opening with the sound of wind blowing, is driven by a repetetive but entertaining bassline.  This song also features the only vocal performance by drummer Nick Mason (the only Floyd to appear on every single one of their albums, BTW) as he growls &quot;One of these day's I'm going to cut you into little pieces,&quot; then the track kicks into full blown high gear.  As the final winds of this track fade out, the gear shifts from high into low, with the lush, beautiful &quot;A Pillow of Winds.&quot;  This incredible track is driven by acoustic picking, clearly influenced by John Lennon compositions &quot;Julia&quot; and &quot;Look At Me.&quot;  This one is great to put on when you cuddle with your girlfriend on a cold night by a roaring fire.  David Gilmour's vocals here are excellent, and the song itself is just pure bliss.  The track that follows is a mid-tempo poppy acoustic number that is very singable.  &quot;Fearless&quot; is a catchy tune that serves as a great centerpiece for the album.  The next track, the jazzy &quot;San Tropez,&quot; shows a playful side of Floyd that the so-called &quot;radio fans&quot; would not have thought of.  This is Roger Waters' only vocal performance on the album, but he would take over in future years, but that's a whole other story.  Closing the first side is the hilarious &quot;Seamus,&quot; a blues about a dog of that name.  As the dog barks throughout, the Floyds show that they can play the blues as can anyone else.  The next track, &quot;Echoes,&quot; takes up all of side two, clocking in at over 23 minutes.  The entire track is pure bliss, with poetic lyrics and heavenly music, this is without question one of the top 5 tracks in the Floyd catalogue.  The sound of blowing winds ends the album just as it began.<br />To those who know this album I cannot tell you anything you don't already know.  To those who don't, this album is highly recommended.  Any Pink Floyd fan will no doubt enjoy this album.  One will not believe why this album is so often overlooked.  This album is excellent and very enjoyable.  Especially if you are a Floyd fan, buy the album and give them you money.  They deserve it.<br />5/5
B00005YW4H|4.0|Love the cd.  She has a soothing voice and I have been playing it on my work cd player for a week now and still haven't gotten sick of it.  Bought it for song #1 however have enjoyed the entire cd.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I tell you if you want to get the house clean in a jiffy put this CD on,  you'll dance around like a fiend.  I'm telling the truth here,  I got me an artificual hip and all sorts of maladies but nevertheless I had me a good old time dusting and vacuuming and kicking up a storm to this CD.  Glad my kids gave it to me right after we saw the movie.
B000065U1N|5.0|I am only fourteen, and I went to see this at the movie theater. I was truly amazed by this compelling story of recent military history. It's a horror story all on it's own.<br />Now, if you have seen the movie, you'll know that people in Somalia, or Africa, were being starved by warlords controlling them. Seeing the people suffer is horrible! In 1993, the U.S. military, including Delta Force and the Army Rangers, were sent in to help with the situation and restore order to the crumbled society. Quite a compelling story at first glance, especially when it is actually true! Seeing the blood and violence is not for the light-hearted or very young children. Mature enough teens can see this.<br />The movie is incredible. I've been waiting a long time for a movie to be pure action from start to finish. This one is. The characters are also good in the movie, and it's easy to feel a real sense of compassion for the victims of the tragedy. Master of action, Ridley Scott, directs the film, while Hans Zimmer provides a powerful score. Acting veterans are scattered everywhere in the film, such as Josh Hartnett and Orlando Bloom. The visuals are too hard to describe-you have to see it to believe it! The whole time I felt as if I was really watching the event take place! From start to finish, all action. This is not another Saving Private Ryan.<br />The DVD extras stink, but that's okay if a DVD is all you've got. The trailers and behind the scenes aren't worth the money. Trust me and get a VHS on this one! If you really want it, it's not a complete waste.<br />Don't forget the Black Hawk Down game coming out this spring on almost all platforms!
B000023VR6|4.0|Let's get right down to the wonderful parts of the album. The beats are magical, and the tones are smooth and easy to groove to. This is straight gangsta rap-put this on when you're going down the highway late at night and you just want to lay low. Snoop Dogg's contributions to the album are wonderful. You can't help but love his style of rap, the lazy, smooth drawl. And Dr. Dre is bigger and better than ever on this album. If you're like me, a huge Eminem fan, then you will cheer when you hear the songs that he appears on. He's the best all the way!<br />Now, I don't know what Dr. Dre was smoking, but other than Eminem and Snoop Dogg an maybe Xzibit, he put some real lackluster rappers that nobody has ever heard of, on this album. That really drags the album into a pit. If Dre didn't have so many goofballs rapping on here, it would be the best rap album every created. Also, Dr. Dre scarcely performs by himself on this thing. I think we all miss that. And finally, some songs can be boring in the lyrics. With this being gangsta rap, most of the songs are about vodka, scams, and cruisin' down the street in a 67' Buick smoking fat Cuban cigars. The style gets old.<br />Overall, this album is good, but not great. If you love rap, get it anyway. Great songs are Still D.R.E., The Next Episode, and Forgot About Dre. On his next effort, let's pray that Dr. Dre can do a little better than on this one. If all of his songs are as good as the highlights on this one, that'll be no problem!
B00005YUNY|5.0|This is why DVD was created. Who cares how many times they do \\"that\\" song or here's \\"another live\\" CD: this is YES.  This is the greatest Yes music ever heard or seen - period.   I saw the NYC concert and was blown away, I remember Jon saying we're recording tonight and we all went wild, (shame its all europe here, but still) then Ritual started and i was mesmerized. Is this the greatest YES song ever???, that middle percussion passage that just grew and grew and then when you think it's Steve Howe time they have added more drums japanese?)and it's just breathless.   I remember thinking can't wait for that DVD and now it's been some months and I play Ritual over and over-again, really, really loud in full 5.1. So go out today or order right now then get 2+ hours alone, sit down and play this loud without any distractions. It's like an event, so indulge your senses.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I am a tough critic, but I love this album! At first, I really didn't like it much. I thought that the Eminem Show was much better, but now I find that this is more \\"classical\\" rap than The Eminem Show. The only problem with this album is lack of songs, and there are a couple of really bad songs, untypical for this rapper. However, the great songs such as \\"Stan\\", \\"The Real Slim Shady\\", and \\"The Way I Am\\" are more than enough to pull the album. Also creating a good scene are \\"Marshall Mathers\\" and \\"I'm Back.\\" The odd thing of this album is the fact that \\"Kim\\" is the best song on here, in terms of artistic value, but it is also the most disturbing. Listen to find out.<br />Production is great as usual, with Dr. Dre being at the front of the production lineup. Except for RBX and Sticky Fingaz, the guest artists are great. This album has exceptionally artistic lyrics, for a rapper. Go get the lyrics off of the internet, and follow along. At times he is disturbing, moody, or even hilarious. Think aggression mixed with The Slim Shady Lp and you'll get the picture. Overall, if you like rap or Em, get the album today! Seriously.
0440237688|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It caused me to think about issues that I do not normally think about.  It also provided an entirely different viewpoint than any that are available in the world today.<BR>The book showed benefits and flaws to a controlled system, one that many people think could work, given a chance.  Some of the issues presented in the book, had not even crossed my mind as being a problem or a solution, such as the formation of the family unit and the generalization of age by having one day on which people advance in age.<BR>The Giver also showed what it would be like to experience certain concepts and emotions for the first time, something I enjoyed tremendously.  Love, anger, hate, suffering; all of these things were discussed in this book with a kind of clarity that no one who had grown up with them could possess.<BR>This book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys being provoked into thought.  It is easy to read, with moderate vocabulary, but is incredibly well-written.
B00006690G|4.0|Eminem, whether we like to admit it or not, is a genius. We like to think of him as a trashy, no good white rapper with appaling lyrics, but no one can deny the real Slim Shady. Every part of Eminem is terrific, and this album is really no different.<br />Some of Eminem's best and worst songs are on this album. Unless you've been living in a nutshell, you have heard Without Me and Cleanin' Out My Closet. Good, huh? Those are only samples of this rapper's true talent, and the face behind the mask. On the downside, some songs on here are pitiful, such as Say What You Say, featuring Dr. Dre, the legendary rap artist. Now, for the two simply greatest rappers in history to be singing this ..., it is really hard to listen to.<br />The album is terrific if you love Eminem, although it is not Eminem's greatest ever. However, it feels good for Eminem to open up a little more about his life. Until now, we really didn't know who the real Slim Shady was or thought. His two previous albums were very much more goofy or fantasy than this.
B000002U82|1.0|Why is this album so overrated? it's not nearly as good as most of their other recordings. This isn't as much an essential as I'd heard it to be. I wouldn't recommend buying it.
B00005NWM3|3.0|I bought this CD knowing that there are only 2 good songs, the ones you have heard on the radio. I accept this truth...you should, too. The rest of the CD is just noise and there are unfortunately no good surprises.
6305291489|5.0|I am sixteen and grew up watching the Hayley Mills version of the Parent Trap. At age eleven (the same age as Annie and Hallie are in this movie) I saw this movie and fell in love with it. Two days ago I watched it again (I got it for Christmas in 1998) and fell in love all over again. So whether you are old, young, or in between, watch this movie for a fun treat!<BR>Hallie Parker (Lindsay Lohan) is an 11 year old, spoiled, bratty, spunky redhead whose dad (Dennis Quaid) is a super rich vineyard owner from Napa, CA. Despite being a little brat, she is rather likable. Annie James (also Lindsay Lohan) is an 11 year old, spoiled, bratty, spunky redhead whose mom (Natasha Richardson) is a super rich up and coming wedding gown designer from London, England. She is also very likable. As far as Annie and Hallie know, each has only one parent (the parents divorced when the two were babies) and is an only child. That is until they wind up at the same summer camp. Annie and Hallie are immediately bitter enemies (both fun, cute, and rich, so why not hate each other?) until their Prank War goes to far and they end up spending the rest of their camp days in an Isolation Cabin with lots of time to spend alone talking about their life stories. It doesn't take them long to figure out that they are twins. They soon decide to switch places and get to know their other parent...hoping that when the parents un-switch them Mom and Dad will see each other, fall in love, and live happily ever after. Perfect plan, right? (ok, so this plan is unbelievable, but just go with it b/c it's fun). There's only one problem. While little Hallie was away at camp, her loyal dad fell in love with a hot young long-legged beauty who only likes him for his money. So before the parents can fall in love again, Annie and Hallie must break up their dad and his new fiance. <BR>This whole movie is a fun ride from beginning to end. Yes, it is predictable but if you are in the mood for a sweet, funny, adorable romantic comedy, this is the movie for you!<BR>P.S. Watch out for a super cute secret handshake between Annie and her butler; also look around for Hallie singing &quot;Let's Get Together&quot; in an elevator--a tribute to the Hayley Mills version.
B00005YTFG|1.0|I didn't like the set, didn't like the costumes, and could not get completely through the movie.  TOO MUCH singing!  I don't like musicals and didn't know that this was a musical.  I hated this movie so much that I gave it away!  I only purchased it because the entertainment world fooled me into believing that it was a great movie.  HA!  I would have had a better time watching paint dry on the front porch in the dark!  There was too many things going on at the same time to make sense of the movie.  If I were Nicole Kidman, I'd seriously think about suing the director, my agent, the producer, the actors and all of their spouses for putting me in such a horrible predicament!
B00004XQ83|4.0|After we finally saw the movie on DVD, I just had to buy the soundtrack. This is a phenomenal soundtrack for folk music, bluegrass, country, soul, and honkytonk fans everywhere. Incredible tracks, unbelievable sound. Some tracks are just flat-out annoying (I do not care for choruses of off-tune 7 year old girls), which is why the CD gets a 4 instead of a 5. But most CD players can skip a track, and the rest of the album just blows me away.
0385484518|5.0|Morrie is one heck of a guy.  How can you not like someone who's favorite poet wrote, \\"Love each other or perish.\\"<br />This book is about a teacher/professor who decides to die surrounded by loved ones and to pass his last days on earth with utmost dignity.  This book is written by a former student who at the time was caught up in the upper ranks of sports journalism and who lost most of his mentor's valuable lessons.  Fortunately, he happens to turn on the TV at the right moment to learn of Morrie's condition.<br />Consequently, Mitch Albom (the student) reaches out to his old Brandeis University professor and they agree to do one last final thesis.  Coincidentally, the decide to meet on Tuesday's, the same day they met for class years earlier.<br />This book is uplifting.  Morrie is not wrapped up with egotistical things, career, having enough money, and seeks simplicity in life.  The author is a gifted writer and carefully documents the slow tortuous death (Lou Gehrig's disease) of his old professor.<br />\\"Tuesday's With Morrie,\\" is a quick read but will make you stop and consider what truly is important in life.
0066214122|1.0|The story starts out only describing one character in detail and ends the same way.  This thin book reads the same, no depth.  I do think that can be produced into a great movie, if they take the Crichton name and the book title, add some action and great special effects.  But, as a book it was lacking in all important aspects, plot, character development and flow.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This cd is by far one of the most complete and masterful albums I own. After reading many negative reviews, I must ask, are you people deaf?  I don't get everyone's constant criticism about comparing John to Dave.  Of course he's going to sound like someone in the industry!  It's called INFLUENCES!  Now I am not knocking DMB for anything, he deserves much credit, and I listen to him religiously.  But why does everyone try to bring Mayer down?  He is a very talented individual and sings songs that many people can relate to.  That is what makes a great artist.  So people please give props where it is due, and John deserves a lot of it.  I would recommend this cd to anyone, my dad even listens to it!
B00008A7HZ|5.0|I recently purchased Delta Goodrem's debut album &quot; Innocent Eyes&quot; after hearing the multi - talented 18 year - old perform the song &quot;Born to try&quot; on &quot;Neighbours&quot;.  The performance was simply breath - taking.  I could not fail to be impressed by Delta's debut single and the album was even more outstanding.  To realise how talented Delta really is, purchasing the album is a must,  it is Simply Outstanding as she managed to write almost the full album herself.<br />    A truly wonderful talent, proven by the fact that &quot;Born to try&quot; reached number 1 in Australia and is soon to be released in the UK where i am sure it will be extremely successful.<br />    Currently the best album in my collection,<br />              Thanks<BR>                      Bryan Edwards
B000088E6D|5.0|I bought this album on a whim.  Michael's voice harks all the way back to the days of the true crooners.  One of the finest albums and a welcome treat after the recent abysmal Rod Stewart release.  <BR>I hesitate not with my endorsement for this fabulous album.  Great for dinners, parties or just shear pleasure.  <BR>Will be awaiting any follow up albums with great anticipation.
B000067CPX|5.0|16 songs of pure musical genius 1.BY THE WAY, great way to start out an album, probably one of the heavest songs on the album, beautiful yet rocking. 2.UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING,with magnificent guitar and drums along with a very kool guitar solo 3.THIS IS THE PLACE. one of the few negiteve things about this albumis that anthony says f**king in this song, but yet a very cool song.4.DOSED,a unique song with three guitars doing tottaly differnt things ,interesting lyics 5.DON'T FORGET ME,not a happy song, but fun to sing to, with fantastic guitar THE ZEPHER SONG,I like the drumming, one of my favorites. 7.CAN'T STOP, try keeping up with Anthony without knowing all the lyrics,a get up and go song. 8.I COULD DIE FOR YOU, the ultimente love song heartfelt lyrics with an unforgetable bridge. 9.MIDNIGHT a searious song but never the less wonderful with chellos and amazing guitars. 10.THROW YOUR TELEVISION, very very kool bass,11.CABRON a mexican sounding song with catchy guitar.12.TEAR one of the more slower songs, neat melody. 13.

0446530573|5.0|I bought this cook book as a gift for my sister. She raved about it so much that I was compelled to buy myself a copy. <BR>I love the easy reading, simple but delicious recipes and beautiful photographs. <BR>My late Italian Aunty Josie would have loved this cookbook. She was the best cook and loved to feed everybody whether you were hungry or not. \\"Sit down and eat something\\" (mangia) was her motto. <BR>She would whip up pasta and oglio al dante. Just one of the many favorites she made. I was thrilled to see that recipe in the cookbook. <BR>Nonetheless, I grew up eating many of the Italian dishes described in this cookbook. Sunday dinners, Christmas Eve, holiday's & celebrations, this book brought back memories! Italians focus everything around large quantities of food. <BR>Now, I feel as though I can continue the family tradition with the Sorprano Family Cookbook. Sadly Aunty Josie passed on with out passing on her homemade recipes to the Fichera family....We may not be the Sorprano's but we are still family!
3438052229|4.0|The importance of BHS is not necessarily its version of the Masora (edited by Gerard Weil) or textual notes (the part that varies from edition to edition), but that its text is the basis for the last generation (thirty years) of commentaries, translations, articles, monographs, &amp;c., so that anyone who wants to use these tools knowledgeably needs to refer to the text of BHS in their own study, just as those who want to compare their favourite translation to the Hebrew or Aramaic text--a common motivation for students of Biblical Hebrew--needs to look at BHS.<br />My rating of four stars reflects my own irritation with the numerous gratuitous textual footnotes based on an editor's concept of what Hebrew poetry (for example) should look like, and the editorial decision to represent (arrange) certain passages in otherwise narrative books as poetry. If one ignores the textual notes, of course, the former is not an issue, and as long as the reader remembers that the manuscript upon which this is based does not reflect &quot;poetic&quot; layout, the latter concern is also laid aside.
B000007T2Z|5.0|This dreary, visionless film contains three songs filled with fear, regret, desire, and hope. I know this because there is a blueprint inside the booklet marking these different feelings (fig. 3a). Also there is some feelings in between such as anxiety, helplessness, and self-doubt. I couldn't have explained it better myself. If you really get into the music, you will feel all these things and more. Each song is longer than the preceeding song, adding up to about 65 minutes running time.<br />If you listen to this with full attention, it will create images in your head. It seems so much like a film -- only you imgine your own visuals so it can be whatever you want. The first song, &quot;The Dead Flag Blues&quot; starts off with a narrator and he is heard a bit later in the song too. For me, this guy is walking around a city that has been destroyed and is slowly making his way to the last remaining corner of the earth. He is trying to make the best of the situation, he says &quot;The skyline was beautiful on fire...&quot; after a while you hear a train go by, i picture he went into the train and fell asleep for many long, cold, rainy hours. Then the dreary, dismal, sorrowful, crying string instruments consume the atmosphere. This is probably one of the most depressing songs i've ever heard. (on the most depressing cd I've ever heard). While listening to it you might just feel like crawling into a sewer and crying or hanging yourself. This song doesn't even have any up-tempo musical climaxes like most godspeed songs do. At the end however, there is a glimmer of hope! this nice nostalgic, faded, twisted old-western melody feels very hopeful.<br />&quot;East Hastings&quot; has some musical climaxes and more clear melodies. Eerie silences lead up to the one main climax in the middle, which is overwhelmingly powerful, and creeps up unexpectedly and backs away just as fast. This song mostly portrays fear.<br />&quot;Providence&quot; contains a lot of subtle, faint melodies, and even though the idea this is the &quot;Soundtrack to the apocalypse&quot; has been tired out, this song really does have that feeling, mostly helplessness and regret in the beginning, leading to hope, fear and others. this song has truly an epic feel to it, with the perfect opener and sections leading into each other that wouldn't sound better any other way to build up these feelings and ideas. This song definitely has some interesting things such as echoed, distant, obscured vocal sections (there arent really vocals on this cd though) and well done percussion work in two different areas. It may seem to be incoherent and going all over the place, but it really makes sense in a poignant way.<br />Is this rock music? who knows. I've always thought of GYBE as a mix in between rock and orchestra, actually leaning a bit more towards orchestra because of the instruments used (violins/cellos along with guitars mostly) and the songwriting techniques. Orchestra with a much darker twist than you've ever heard before.<br />I don't feel I've descibed as much as I really feel when listening to this cd, it is a truly unexplainable experience and you must hear it for yourself!and even though the idea this is the &quot;Soundtrack to the apocalypse&quot; has been tired out, this song really does have that feeling, mostly helplessness and regret in the beginning, leading to hope, fear and others. this song has truly an epic feel to it, with the perfect opener and sections leading into each other that wouldn't sound better any other way to build up these feelings and ideas.

0553269631|5.0|Imagine George Bailey plunging to his death as \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" comes to a premature end.  In a sense, that's what we see in this compelling novel by Carson McCullers.  We see what one man means to others but he is never given his Clarence to find that out himself.  <br />It's hard to say just who is the main character in this book but I go with the idea that it is John Singer, a deaf mute who becomes the conscience of the community's troubled souls.  There are certainly other characters who take their repeated turns on the main stage.  There is an alcoholic labor agitator who can't seem to understand that complex new ideas are best delivered in simple, small doses.  There is a black doctor who has risen to to a height of respectability due his profession that is denied him due to his color.  There is the owner of a diner who is an observer of his community but apparently not a participant.  There is a young girl who becomes a woman way too soon.  All these people gravitate to Mr. Singer who can't speak but does a great job of listening (he is able to read lips).  While they unload their cares, they assume that their listener has no cares of his own.  The reader gradually realizes otherwise although Mr. Singer's solution to his own problems still comes as a shock.  In the end, the others move on and we are left with a glimpse of into life in a rural town in the Deep South circa 1939 (quite similar to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\").<br />There are ample coices of themes in this book.  What I took away with me was the interdependence people have on each other.  Certainly there was plenty of discord shown on these pages.  However, each character needed to have someone to talk to in order to deal with their inner turmoils.  Mr. Singer was the ideal listener and people kept coming back to him because of this tonic that he offered.  In contrast, Singer had no one to talk to about his turmoils.  He did originally but that contact was withdrawn from him and ultimately lostto him altogether.  I'm sure others who read this book found other insights.  This is a very readable novel with something for everyone.  Read it and discover your own messages.

0385503954|5.0|Love and Redemption are tried and true subjects for novels. However Ian McEwan's Atonement tells the story in an original, gripping manner. This book will get inside your head, and during the periods that you are forced to put it down, it will dredge up those times in your life that you made a mistake, and tried to make things right. Of course we can't make everything right all the time. Some things we can't ever fix--and here we are, with material for a novel. McEwan brings us characters in a disfunctional family in pre-war England. A big, terrible mistake by a naive young female family member changes everyone's lives, mostly for the worse. Years pass and the girl grows up and realizes just how big a mistake she has made, and sets out to make things right. This turns out to be dreadfully difficult. World War II has started. The rest of the family has their own problems. <br />The end holds a surprise; it is delightful. Can hearts, lives, and people that have been broken be made whole again? Once a huge mistake has been made, does honesty, sincerity and truthfullness win the day? Or can our actions haunt us with unreconciled acts and estrangement. McEwan gives us hints. The judgement is ours.<br />This is one of the best books of the last few years. If you like excellent, compelling writing, it will stick in your mind for a while after you're done.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam's Riot Act is a nice blend of good old rock and roll. Although 2000's Binaural was good, it was by far not their best work. It was missing an edge, which Riot Act provides effortlessly. I read about critics asking for a Pearl Jam masterpiece, and that sounds so ridiculous. Just look at the entire Pearl Jam catalog, and they collectively ARE a masterpiece. They are the most consistent band I have ever heard. They write the music they want, and say f--- you to anyone who doesn't like it. Riot Act is great from beginning to end with &quot;Save You&quot;,&quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;, &quot;Cropduster&quot;, &quot;I Am Mine&quot;,and &quot;Get Right&quot; as my favorites. If you are a true Pearl Jam fan, like myself, this is a must buy. But if you are a chump and you only like their debut, Ten, then don't waste your time. To Pearl Jam, keep making great music.

0553208845|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about _Siddhartha_. It is the most potent and miserly introduction to Eastern thought I have read.  With all the vague and mysterious books on Eastern philosophy out there, this book stands alone as the quickest and most efficient way to enlightenment.  If you are curious about Zen Buddhism and Hinduism, this is the best place to start your journey towards enlightenment.  If you are already a Zen guru, this could also be the last book you ever read and you would still get just as much out of it.  It is for both beginner and expert alike.  I especially like the almost biblical flavor to this book.  Herman Hesse is a legitimate myth-maker, and _Siddhartha_ reads like a parable of wisdom from some ancient, archaic religious text.  That is what makes this book so special.  It also almost singlehandedly triggered a worldwide revival in studying and writing about the wisdom of the East.
B0000009XP|5.0|I recieved this Buddy Guy cd when I was moving away from popular music and goin to classic rock, blues, and jazz. This cd still is constant rotation after owning it for over 6 years. All the songs on here are impressive and makes one wish that Buddy Guy payed less attention to the crowd and more attention to his guitar. If you prefer more hooked oriented, pop sounding contemporary blues than this isn't your thing. But then again blues isn't suppossed to sound contrived and too radio friendly. When I listen to this cd I wonder where Buddy Guy gets all this energy...it's almost like straight ahead Chicago blues with the energy of Hendrix....lotsa funk, random jazz type phrasing and interaction, tons of jamming. This is one of those cds you listen with your mouth wide open in full attention of his crazy guitar. Five years ago I picked up my Fender strat with this cd in the background. There are very few things that will make you break your guitar strings as much as trying to recreate the sounds and intensity on this cd. This is the over-the-edge style of playing that only Buddy Guy can create.
6305972591|5.0|In the 80s you could make a low budget horror flick with unknown actors and it would become a household name.  This is the case with Children Of The Corn.  Not a great movie or anything, but a classic nonetheless.  In all honesty, I have absolutely no clue how so many sequels got made.  But this one is 100% horror movie junkfood entertainment that they just cannot make anymore.  The movie tries to be creepy, but only succeeds some of the time.  The first scene in the diner is still a bit shocking even today.  Unfortunately, the rest of the film never lives up to that scene.  Another highlight is John Franklin's performance as Isaac.  They couldn't have picked a better guy for this part, he's pretty creepy.  He could pass for 17 or 30, man or woman!  I could have done without all the supernatural junk thrown in near the end, and the \\"monster\\" that looks like Bugs Bunny tunneling to Albuquerque.  Do you think anyone would notice a deserted town after three years?  But I don't like this movie for it's logic, just coz it's fun.
0312305060|5.0|This is truly a GREApiece of literature. Michael Cunningham is suprisingly detail in his description of every object, action, and thought. Half way through this book and i said to myself, &quot;Wow, so this is what a Pulitzer Price winner reads like.&quot; And what suprised me the most was how easily readable this book was. This book didn't need esoteric language to be great. It is great. It would be a shame for anyone to miss this book.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Im not gonna bore you with what I thought of it, just by me writing this review you can guess that I really like them, and I do, and so wll you.  This is a geat album, it only has a few songs, that is the only real downside, but thats only cause this is their first american CD, but FYI, they are HUGE all over the rest of the world, they are bigger than Britney and Nsync, put together...dont believe me?  Of course you wouldnt, cause you have never heard of them right, of course not, cause you watch MTV right?  Of course you do, thats where you get all your music info from right?  Well then my friend, you would be very very wrong, MTV only puts on what is \\"HOT\\" and then they stick with the same people for like 3 years, think about it, it takes 65 days for a video to finally be kciked off TRL, that means for 65 days you are listening to practically the same music, and by they time that one song gets old, the same artist has already released a new single, and your still looking at their perfect little mug dancing around your tv screen, T.A.T.U. is what you would call breakthrough, they made it through the piles and piles of ... old music, and are finally being recongnized by the US, its about time, they are HUGE ALL OVER THE WORLD, and we just not hear about them.  You wont  regret spending the 10 bucks on this CD, but it now before its costs 30 bucks like all the other CD's.
B000084T18|4.0|Good album. A little too thug for me. He does want to kill my cats (turn their flesh into lead) and sleep with my mother, but he does it in an entertaining way. At least Eminem produces and raps, and 50 Cent is quite talented. A pretty solid purchase, as long as you are not looking for any goods lyrics.

0553062182|5.0|I truly wish that this book would have existed 30 or more years ago. Almost everthing traditionally written on this subject has been tacitly negative. The highly sensitive, or introverted, personality type was automatically assumed to be defective to some degree for their failure to \\"adapt\\" to the extroverted \\"norm.\\" I think that this is because most traditional American psychological thought has been fundamentally industrial and military psychology- the subject is always supposed to adapt to the environment and never the other way around. Those who cannot adapt are identified and disposed of. That is certainly how military psychology has always been practiced. This book is the first to demonstrate that highly sensitive people are both \\"normal\\" and have many valuable traits. Indeed, they excel against extraverts in most areas that make people truly \\"human.\\" Not only that, but in other cultures without an unnatural majority of extraverts, the sensitive person was seen as the ideal friend and citizen.<br /><br /> I especially appreciated the explanation of the biochemistry of \\"over-stimulation.\\" When sensitive people are forced to interact in unnatural evironments the cortisol levels in their bloodstream increases, making them even more sensitive to their environment than they usually are. Unless they can withdraw, or otherwise calm themselves, it is a virtual certainty that they will overreact. This means that they will act contrary to their usual conscientious, reasonable, and understanding normal behavior in order to escape. Needless to say, inspite of the fact that this reaction is virtually out of their control, this overreaction is dealt with harshly by society- and by employers. Inspite of the fact that highly sensitive people are the most conscientious, hard-working, competent, and even gifted, of employees 99% of the time, this absolute physical need to escape to a less stressful environment can ruin their lives. They are labeled as freaks, as not being \\"team players\\"- and as \\"unemployable.\\" I know this, for like the author, I was also born a HSP. This means that in an unnaturally extraverted society I often find myself wishing that I had not been born at all- inspite of my gifts, inspite of the shear injustice of it all....s\\"- and as \\"unemployable.\\" I know this, for like the author, I was also born a HSP. This means that in an unnaturally extraverted society I often find myself wishing that I had not been born at all- inspite of my gifts, inspite of the shear injustice of it all....
B000001Y5D|4.0|I got this record after I heard What's up, not really for it, just hoping it was going to be interesting and I got lucky. The album is really good, a lot harder than I would have thought. It starts in force with Train, it's quite unexpected really, and then it goes in the same vein with Superfly. Things cool down a little after that, but they don't really get pensive. There is sheer force throughout the album and not only due to the impressive vocals (but largely thanks to it all the same). Very good drum work and guitars are up to it as well. I was impressed with the variety of themes as well, it's not the kind of thing that goes on with the same kind of songs, changing the tune a bit from one to the next. No, every song has its well defined personality, no way to mix them up. The other thing about it is the actual recording, it sounds absolutely briliant, one of the best sounding records I've got, even if it goes back all that time. Sounds a lot better than a lot of remastered albums if you asked me. Too bad it was the one and only, but there you go. Better than five so and so albums, that's for sure.
B00006RU5B|5.0|First of all, I want to let it be known to everyone else who reviews this... that this is not Rage Against The Machine, or Soundgarden.  IT IS A NEWLY FORMED BAND with many past influences that mesh into a killer group.  And as for a lack of polotics... lyrical motives come from the person who writes the lyrics, and the lead singer of Audioslave writes some damn good ones.  Try getting out of your commercial bubble of rebellion and listen to some music with feeling and substance.  Songs dealing with personal revalation help people in real life. No song can, &quot;change the world,&quot; no matter how powerful the message.  But a song can change, &quot;your world.&quot;  Audioslave has put together a monumental collection of songs that incorperate different styles and the brains and talent to make it work.  Great album... something fresh.
B00003CXAA|1.0|As you can tell from my other reviews, I usually give great reviews. But these movies deserve ZERO STARS!! The Godfather films ... big time. I day dreamed during the first two. I didn't watch the third one. I only watched the first two because of Cinema class I had my senior year during high school. Don't waste your time on this piece of garbage. It's not worth it. I would not recomend watching this movie even if it was for free. Find another movie to watch you will be glad that you did. The Godfather ... big time. I did not find any enjoyment out of the first two movies, except for when they were over. I wanted to jump up and down when they were over. I have seen tons of movies and there are only three movies that I do not like. I don't like the first two Godfather movies, and a horror movie that I can't remember the name of. In other words stay as far away as you can from the Godfather movies. You will be glad that you did.
0064409422|5.0|I am a lover of books, and I think I know why.  It is this book, the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, and that other book, Charlotte's Web, that I read when I was too young to fight off the effects of a good read.  And then I was hooked.  Parents, if you want your kids to love reading, give them this book when they are between seven and ten.  It will blow their mind and forever mark them as studious, brilliant, wise, noble, as are all the young kings and queens of Narnia.  And don't forget to give them a dose of the spider, too, in Charlotte's Web
B00005JLF5|5.0|Deep Space Nine is truly the hidden treasure of the Star Trek franchise.  Instead of telling the umpteenth story of a ship in space meeeting new aliens with funny noses, DS9 explored the human (and alien) condition living in space.  In retrospect, the show gallantly became an archetype for our world.  Multiple cultures sharing the same world (or region of space).  Throughout the series, alliances change, cultures meld (or fall apart) but through it all, we see the true sense of the human spirit.  While I'm sure Gene Roddenberry would have had a problem with the initial premise of the show, the series turned out to showcase a group of characters who exemplified the best of humanity. <br />If you're looking for great acting and great drama, tune into the episode \\"DUET\\".  It's a two character story between Major Kira (the amazing and painfully underrated Nana Visitor) and a former Cardassian overlord.  Clearly, an early sign of great things to come from this series.  <br />I'd much rather watch reruns of DS9 than new episodes of the ghastly \\"Enterprise\\" any day.
0140157352|5.0|This book is a true classic.  It takes you step by step through the various methods of conflict resolution.  It teaches us that quite often there is a win-win situation that we should strive to achieve, no matter what we may feel personally about the person we are &quot;negotiating&quot; with.  I can't tell you how many times I've referred this book to people at work who are having problems with each other.  Business professionals and world leaders alike have been influenced by the book.  A great book.  A very important book.
B00006F83Y|5.0|probably the best album since nevermind.  The problem with rock today is that its all crap, like creed and nickleback.  There of course are several others.  People today just keep on buying that garbage, and most of them will never hear this album just because they don't know what great solid rock sounds like.  For some reason music fans of today can't hear greatness.  I tip my hat to Queens because they made a hell of a record, and i'm looking forward to their future work.  If your looking to buy this album, well stop looking and scoop it up.  Its really in my opinion a 4 star album, but because todays music really stinks up the ears, its a 5.
6303257844|5.0|I can't understand why any fan of action would dislike this film.  This movie is . . . fast.  The first time I saw it, my heart was racing as fast as the bus itself.  I kept saying to myself, there is no way they can sustain this kind of pace for 120 minutes--but they did!  This movie rocks!
6305603847|5.0|Anyone who has experienced The Wall knows that it is an incredible film.  Having been intimately familiar with the songs before I first saw the movie, I was astounded by how the visual images exceeded my imagination to a degree I didn't think was possible.<br />I am however compelled to log a complaint about the DVD.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound track is inferior to the PCM stereo track on this DVD.  The 5.1 track is not as crisp overall, with the surround channels being particularly noisy.  This finding really surprised me, but despite numerous adjustments and listenings I find the PCM stereo track to be much more enjoyable.<br />On a positive note, the PCM stereo track is still better than most DVD movies.  The PCM track invokes a full 3-D sound -- you will still hear artillary shells zipping over your head, and feel the crashing down of The Wall.  I possess THX-certified components and am experienced with 5.1, so I don't think I'm having a technical issue.  Additionally, I have heard this same problem with a friend using a different disk and audio rig.<br />Please Roger, we need a new 5.1 remastering of The Wall !!!
B000000W3G|4.0|This is a surprisingly good collection of the singles and their respective b-sides from the Mellon Collie sessions, with many terrific tunes that aren't nearly as over-the-top as some of Mellon Collie's more silly moments.  It's amazing that such good songs were relegated to b-side status.  Though the format makes for a difficult listen, and a couple of the singles aren't that great, it's still a worthwhile set for anyone interested in delving into the Pumpkins further.<br />Disc 1- Bullet with Butterfly Wings is probably the weakest of the five, being mostly a collection of pretty mediocare cover songs.  The second track, \\"Said Sadly\\", is the exception, a bouncingly sad original piece sung by James Iha and D'Arcy (I believe).  Very heartfelt and sweet.  I wish this were placed on one of the other discs instead.  The Cars cover is pretty much the only other one worth listening to on the disc.<br />Disc 2- 1979 is where things pick up quite a bit.  All of the b-sides here are exceptional, and combined with what follows, you wonder why they didn't even make a 3-disc album with Mellon Collie.  \\"Ugly\\" is a simple plaintive tune the kind that Corgan is (or at least used to) be able to churn out by the handful.  Despite his grating whine, he puts feeling and emotion into the melody.  \\"The Boy\\" comes next, one of my favorite Iha-penned tunes, a rollicking number in the spirit of 1979, yet remove the generational context and replace it with simple longing.  \\"Cherry\\" and \\"Believe\\", by Corgan and Iha respectively, continue the same great midtempo vein, and although samey, are rousing songs of loss and hope.  \\"Set the Ray to Jerry\\"'s probably the sexiest (yes, sexiest) songs the Pumpkins ever wrote, with a lustful bass and rhythm section backing Corgan's almost cooing vocals.  Good stuff all around.<br />Disc 3- Zero is again a mixed bag of sorts.  \\"God\\" probably comes closest to the silliness of Mellon Collie with its over-the-top, quasi-cliched vocals.  The lyrics could almost make a good NIN song (as good as NIN songs are considered to be, which isn't much).  \\"Mouths of Babes\\" I believe was a song oringinally from the Siamese Dream era, and it shows with the same kind of grungy thundering pace of that material.  One of the highlights, along with the almost-funky \\"Tribute to Johnny\\" (I think its a dedication to their deceased keyboardist).  \\"Marquis in Spades\\" is so overblown, you can't help but like it.  Probably the meanest vocal Corgan's ever done, and it comes off as convincing.  For once the angst of the music is matched pound for pound with Corgan's own, and it doesn't come off so forced.  He even pulls off a couple of great primal screams during the track.  \\"Pennies\\" kind of clashes with the rest of the material on the disc, but it's still a jolly little listen with a great chorus.  The last track, though, could really be done without.  \\"Pisctachio Medley\\" is a 26 minute useless hodge-podge of bits and pieces from various outtakes.  Though some of the melodies seem interesting, and you want to know what the whole song was like, in the end it's just trying.<br />Disc 4- Tonight Tonight is the most depressing fare of all the discs.  All mostly acoustic guitar and little else, most of these tunes are genuinely affecting.  \\"Maladori Magpie\\" has the gentlest rhythm to it that it becomes nicely catchy and bordering on the edge of depressing all at the same time.  \\"Rotten Apples\\", on the other hand, is quite depressing, though a fairly good sad song.  \\"Jupiter's Lament\\" is by far my favorite, a whistful tune about wanting to leave the world behind while holding onto the tinge of hope that remains.  Short and very sweet.  \\"Medellia of the Grey Skies\\" is unbearably dark though, and just might be the most depressing song ever.  Sad and echoey, I can't stand to listen to it because of the plain moroseness of it all.  \\"Blank\\" kind of relieves that, being a small simple acoustic song with a simple plaintive message.  Very good, but quite a downer.<br />Disc 5- Thirty-Three rounds out the package nicely.  The first 3 b-sides on the disc are absolute essentials.  \\"The Last Song\\" is as affecting as any a Pumpkins song have been.  Wonderfully beautiful guitar bridge done by William Corgan Sr., Billy's dad.  Then comes \\"The Aeroplane Flies High\\", practically the centerpiece of this set.  Fading in and out samples from the band, Corgan reading a bit of prose and the others making cryptic epithets, it all comes down in a crash of guitar noise that sustains through most of the song.  A bit overdramatic, but still an intense piece of music.  Uplifting in the darkest way possible, is probably the best way I can describe it.  \\"Transformer\\" is next, which is simply a great rock song, with a terrific beat and guitar work by Corgan and Iha.  Practically the same as their other guitar-based tracks, but with the company they're in, that's one of the highest compliments that could be paid.  \\"The Bells\\" is another sad song from Iha that is kind of superfluous and not as good as his other material on the album.  The closing cover \\"My Blue Heaven\\" is lilting and lulling in a good way, but kind of leaves one cold after the outstanding tunes before it.  Still a great way to close the set.<br />Overall a wonderful collection.  If you have the money and the interest in the Pumpkins, by all means go for it.  The format, though, is what hurts it the most.  It would be awesome if it were all put on a single CD, Pisces Iscariot-style.  Then it would have been essential, and better than Mellon Collie even.  In any case, it's definitely better that this music exists than not at all, and do yourself a favor and pick this up if you enjoy the Pumpkins to any degree.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I just listened to this album, and now I'm going to buy it and &quot;Return of Saturn.&quot; I've never listened to an album like this before. It's happy, makes me want to go on vacation for about a month. It has influences in reggae, good 80s music (I think), and dance/techno-type music (I don't know how to describe it). But this is certainly a rock album, not a pop album. My favorite songs are &quot;Underneath It All,&quot; &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot; &quot;Start The Fire,&quot; &quot;In My Head,&quot; and &quot;Waiting Room&quot; and &quot;Rock Steady.&quot; But I love all of the tracks. This album will stand as a new, unique type of listening in collection, and I have a lot of cds from many genres. I'm really glad that No Doubt made this album.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay, simply, is about as close as we're ever going to come to another U2.  They don't have quite the social consciousness or lyrical consistency (at least yet), but they have the best singer and the most creative guitarist to bring their music across the pond since the Irish rockers.  Direct and poignant without Radiohead's slight tendency towards a condescending tone, Coldplay offers a varied musical landscape rife with cranking guitars, ringing pianos, gospel choirs and soaring strings in astonishingly effective packages.  One never gets the sense that the arrangements are overdone or even close to getting out of hand.  The only thing missing from this album is more vocal harmony, but one can see why - what harmonist could ever complement Chris Martin?  His voice is out of this world, with all the soul of Jeff Buckley, the drive of Thom Yorke, and better pitch and control to boot.  This band will do great things.
B000088E6M|5.0|This is the hottest album out right now.  If you are a rap fan, you must have this album in your collection.  It fuses hardcore street lyrics with excellent production from Dre.  Its justs sounds awesome.  Put the the CD in the deck and just listen.  Great DVD extras only bolster this awesome package from 50.  Columbia made a huge mistake dropping this cat from their roster.  He came along way dragging alot of haters, he addresses this on the album.  Just cop it.  You will not be disappointed.
B00005YW4H|3.0|... There is no doubt that Norah Jones is the most formidable new jazz vocal talent since Diana Krall.  Her vocal control, style, tone, and soul are unmistakably brilliant.  I also find her writing ability to be fantastic, as evidenced by the title track - the only reason her tracks don't stand out as much on the CD is because of the star-studded cast of old-time songwriters represented by the other tracks.  However, there is a major caveat with this album, which is that its mood is completely monotonal.  Taken individually, each track is a beautiful lament (Don't Know Why), slow burning love song (Come Away With Me), or smoky introspective (Nightengale).  However, taken en masse they create such a dark, contemplative weave that after a while the listener loses consciousness of the details of the tunes and his/her attention easliy wanders to other things.  The introduction of even one or two upbeat, more aggressively arranged tunes would save this record and earn it 5 stars in my book.  I'd like to hear Jones take on some of the bop classics, or maybe dabble in some Kurt Elling-like rearrangements of mellower tunes with spicier backgrounds.  All in all though, a CD worth owning and an artist worth looking out for in the future.
0316666343|2.0|Doesn't live up to the hype at all. Sebold tries to tackle ideas that are substantial with weak writing. As a result, complicated themes are barely supported by immature writing.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay have done it again.  While Parachutes was a brilliant beginning, becoming almost as instant a classic (with a little less radio polish) as Counting Crows'  &quot;August and Everything After&quot;, A Rush of Blood to the Head is more than a classic - it is a masterpiece.  Chris Martin pushes the cannon of pop and rock vocals beyond anything ever done before.   The music is arranged with perfect balance between guitar, piano, and other instruments.  The hooks are brilliant, the melodies so well thought it out I find it amazing that the music doesn't sound contrived.  Instead it is emotive, powerful, demanding of attention.<br />But don't be fooled - this isn't just Parachutes v2, with a little added punch.  Coldplay explore totally new ground here - from the edgy, in-your-face rock of &quot;Politik&quot; to the exotic arabic-influenced &quot;Daylight&quot;, they puah the envelope in every direction.   Rock doesn't get any better than this.  Coldplay join U2 and David Gray as the best artists of the last five years and undoubtedly of the next twenty (incidently, it certainly sounds to me like Coldplay and David Gray have been listening to each other - and I can't imagine a more fruitful interaction).
B00003CXC7|4.0|I've always loved this film but was shocked by the poor quality of this restoration. The grain is heavy and the colors are flat. Was the negative that bad? Could it be the transfer? It appears worse than the prints that have been floating around during the last 20 years. Compared to the restoration of films of that same period it just doesn't compare.
B00000DFMM|5.0|During the '80's there was an explosion of bands (a lot of them British) that used synthesizers to inovate their sound.A lot of them succeeded too..(Depeche Mode,Heaven 17,Human League etc.)in gaining a mass audience that welcomed each new album with relish.However, no one really established the chilling effect of synthpop like Propaganda did.Hailing from Germany, these four musicians made a masterpiece during 1985 that would define the '80s alternative music scene forever.With British ace producers Trevor Horn and Steve Lipson at the helm,A Secret Wish was born.The cinematic opener,A Dream Within A Dream  is truly a standout.Singer Suzanne Freytag's icy narration lasts well over 8 minutes before turning over the major vocal duties to Claudia Brucken who has the most unsual but interesting voice that debut's on The Murder Of Love.Duel and P-machinery were the commercials high points.Both were sizeable hits with a heavy percussion sound.The rest of the album is much darker and forbidding .Dr Mabuse(their first single)tells the tale of evil doings,while Frozen Faces(another standout)and The Chase highlight Claudia's voice to the best effect.The closing track Strength To Dream establishes once again the chilling cinematic presence of the album opener A Dream Within A Dream.This album is truly a classic.I just hope that Propaganda would reform and make another masterpiece like this one.
B00006RU5B|2.0|If you're a big Rage fan I guarantee you probably won't like this album. I know I didn't. Tom, Tim and Brad are perfect together (Zack is perfect with them too), but I don't know about Chris. Chris changed the sound quite a bit. If you like Soundgarden get this, but if you like Rage Against the Machine, don't get this. If you like both... get it, but expect more Soundgarden than Rage.
B0000029AP|5.0|THe modern Aerosmith (pos-PUMP) is definetly not my type of rock band...<br />But there´s nothing more to say about the stupendous quality of the &quot;old&quot; Aerosmith, that of ROCKS and TOYS IN THE ATTIC.<br />TOYS IN THE ATTIC is  a superb piece of hard rock, nothing more, nothing less.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Rio is in close competiton with the Duran Duran debut as the best album the group has ever released in my opinion. What keeps it from being their best for me is 100% a personal preference: Rio is a much 'happier' album than the debut. Where the debut travels from ascerbic to moody to near vicious in places [see Girls On Film and Careless Memories], Rio's darker or more melancholic moments [The Chauffeur, Save A Prayer] are fairly sweet and are what amount to love songs. <br />The fact that Save A Prayer and The Chauffeur are love songs certainly doesn't keep them from being my favorite tracks from Rio along with New Religion. The Chauffeur has become something of a cult classic among Duranies and is a great example of Nick Rhodes creativity and points toward their more artsy side which would subsequently be on major display with Arcadia's So Red The Rose. Save A Prayer is a  real sentimental favorite that combines Duran Duran arthouse panache with the epitomy of what a ballad should be.<br />Duran Duran's second album brings to the table a much warmer collection of songs than the debut, which was certainly intentional. From the opening title track to Hungry Like The Wolf, the image of the album was transformed for Mtv perfectly, as evidenced by the accompanying videos on the remastered version. All in all, Rio is a pristine album. The weakest track is Lonely In Your Nightmare, and this is a single-worthy song mind you. I still juggle between Rio and the '81 debut as to which I truly prefer, because they are mostly equal. It mostly depends on the mood I'm in or wish to be in. Rio is fun jetsetting; the debut just fits my personality a small bit better.
B000069HKH|3.0|OF course we all know that, when it comes to final production decisions, The Boss has the final word, no matter who is the &quot;official&quot; producer of his albums.<br />But in THE RISING it seems he trusted producer Brendan O´Brien a lot, and he should not have done that, because what could you expect from a typical pop producer like Brendan?<br />The rsult was a ultra-slick production, also sometimes muddy, that hides a  lot of the majestic capability of the E Street Band, and cut out the typical Bruce energy and inspiration, even in the best songs.<br />I agree that 14 songs maybe was too much, he could have edited some of them out. But, if anyone has the talent to write loads of songs, this is BRuce (check TRACKS, for example!)
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent has surprisingly went from \\"Most Hated\\" to \\"Most Anticipated\\" to \\"Most Celebrated\\". You may remember him from 1999's single, \\"How to Rob an Industry N\\", where he jokingly talked about robbing many famous artists like Mariah Carey (who was on his label, Columbia) while ribbing them at the same time. Not many artists found that funny, the song turned into a gimmick and soon he was dropped from Columbia (maybe it wasn't a good idea to sing about robbing your labelmates???). During his downtime, he made many foes, including Jay-Z (in 1999's \\"It's Hot\\", Jigga rapped, \\"I'm about the dollar/WTF is 50 Cent?\\"), and I think that he's even been shot more times than 2Pac. But after Eminem picked 50 up and signed him to his Shady Records label, and 50 dropping \\"Wanksta\\" and a few underground albums with his crew, the \\"GGGgggg-uuuUnit!\\", the streets embraced him and anticipation was at an all-time high.<br />Get Rich or Die Tryin' is one of those debut albums that actually lives up to its hype. In fact, if you're in your car playing it to the end, you may just feel like playing the whole album again. While the lyrical content may not break any new ground, 50 Cent, whose flow sounds like a mixture of Jay-Z, 2Pac, and Mase, knows how to deliver it WELL. See \\"Gotta Make it to Heaven\\" (an otherwise played-out subject matter with gangsta rappers), where he gives the topic an interesting twist, and \\"In the Club\\", where he takes topics like cars, drinks, and women and make them sound original. Fans may say that song sounds radio-friendly, but he didn't go to mainstream, mainstream went to him.<br />The production on here is also stellar; not one track sounds similar to another, a problem on most rap albums today. Check out the dark beat on \\"Patiently Waiting\\" with Eminem and \\"21 Questions\\" and notice the difference in production. And what would a rap album be without a diss record? (See \\"Wanksta\\" and the funnier \\"Back Down\\", both aimed at Ja Rule.)<br />Even though \\"P.I.M.P.\\" isembarrasingly old-school and lazy on 50's part, Get Rich... is one of those rarities in hip-hop: a highly anticipated album that truly delivers, by a rapper who disregarded gimmicks to let people know why Slim Shady signed him.

0061091480|2.0|I heard an interview with Dyer and Tony Robbins so I decided to listen to one of Dyer's audiobooks.  I was really disappointed.  The entire thing was him talking so softly it was very boring.  I feel this CD is good for people who are very unhappy with their lives, depressed, etc.  But if you're relatively happy with yourself and just looking for a fun program to try, THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT IT!
B000084T18|3.0|This album is so confusing... What the hell happened to 50 cent? Its seems that every artist that signs with aftermath has to \\"do what Dre says\\" and destroy whatever style they used to have with a Dre formulaic album... Does Xzibits last two albums come to mind? 50 cent is probably one of the hottest rappers on the scene right now, building his rep through numerous bootlegs, the anticipation for his debut on aftermath/shady records was huge. But if anyone has heard Power of the Dollar they will know that 50 is capable of running with the greatest. He is real, he is clever and he isn't afraid to speak his mind. It is the production and repetitive subject matter of this album which is so dissapointing. Not enough gritty street, to many in the club bangers. 50's east coast feel is lost on this album and what the \\"heck\\" is with \\"pimp\\" and every \\"darn\\" song eminem produced? There are so many problems with this album yet there are some high points which are amazing... \\"what up gangsta\\", \\"heat\\", \\"if I cant\\", \\"many men\\"  and of course \\"in da club\\" but other than those there isn't much here. 50 should look to some real producers that create a new sound and the not recycled sounds that dre and eminem lay down on the boards.

B00005QGAZ|5.0|This is to pop music what Illmatic is to the rap world... as close to perfect as you can possibly come. Both are relatively short (Thriller has 9 songs, Illmatic has 9 plus an intro), but both are widely regarded as among the best of their respective genres. These songs are all outstanding, and I'm sure you've heard them all millions of times before. If you don't have it, get it... it's just that simple.

B00005B36H|5.0|The \\"Lateralus\\" album marks a watershed of sorts for Tool.  Their sound developed from raw beginnings into a smooth, haunting nightmare punctuated with anger and violent imagery.  After \\"Aenima\\" and the related legal wranglings with their record label, Maynard James Keenan took a break to do vocals for \\"A Perfect Circle,\\" a band whose sound was tool-esque, yet mellower and more melodic.<br />With Lateralus, the third full-length album from Tool, the listener reaps the fruits of Keenan's labors with APC and Tool.  The Lyrics are as cryptic and intriguing as ever, and the songs as epic as those from Aenima, but the tenor has shifted subtlely toward melodic vocalization and more thought-provoking lyrics than angry ones.  \\"Schism,\\" \\"The Patient,\\" and \\"Lateralus\\" all are songs Tool could never have written two or even one album ago.<br />\\"Ticks and Leeches\\" has a little of the old Tool rage in it, and it scans like a companion piece to Aenima's brilliant commentary on selling out, \\"Hooker With a Penis.\\"  \\"Parabola\\" is another up-tempo song, and one of the few on the album that are not epic both in terms of diverse musical directions as well as length.  The album also contains several short \\"bridge\\" tracks, which I find less than enjoyable, but which work better on this album than on Aenima.  \\"Faaip de Oiad\\" is actually more disturbing than any track that short has a right to be, and it showcases Tool's brilliance at poking listeners in the right place to make them think and freak them out.<br />The liner notes also deserve a special mention in this review, because in classic Tool style, they are so radically different as to be shocking.  The Jewel Case has an outer plastic sleeve which has the album title on the front and track listing and engineering/production credits on the back.  Slip that off and pull out the booklet, though, and all you get is bizzare drawings on transparent sheets of acetate of the layers of muscle and tissue inside a human being.  There is also pseudo-buddhist imagery, and no explanation, no punchline.<br />The essence of a Tool record is that you, the listener, are there to experience them.  You are not asked (indeed, often not allowed) to understand, merely accept that they are a unique band with a unique style, and half the bands out right now could not hope to touch their style and creativity.  Bravo.seudo-buddhist imagery, and no explanation, no punchline.<br />The essence of a Tool record is that you, the listener, are there to experience them.

B00005JLSC|5.0|It's not often a musical floors me, but when it happens, it wins me for good. About the only musical genre I'm a complete sucker for consist of old Busby Berkeley flicks. <br />I went into this film knowing absolutely nothing about the musical, and I'm glad I did. This is one great film, and the effect is even greater going in without expectations. The plot is a fine thread involving murderous self-centered folks (Zellweger & Zeta-Jones) in the entertainment industry, folks who we would normally loathe were they not surrounded by even scummier scam artists. Add some brisk Guajardian wit to the dialogue and lyrics, and this gritty piece winds up charming and amusing, without straying into syrupy!<br />When I talk to other fans of this film, I find it interesting the variety of characters that steal the show for them. Some were blown away by Richard Gere's sly lawyer sans morals, some by Rene Zellweger's [up an rising] star, and a few dug Lucy Liu's too brief performance.<br />It was Queen Latifah who absolutely stole the show for me. She was awesome portraying Prison Matron Mama, a performance that was excellent with dialogue alone. But it was her song and dance number \\"When You're Good To Mama\\" introducing Mama early in the film that won me over as a Queen Latifah fan for good! OH MAN! She's got a rich beauty in her singing voice, does a sexy & sassy dance number, and she has charisma with an aura all its own! <br />Strongest dance number overall was \\"Cell Block Tango\\" in which the other women prisoners each have a song & dance telling us how and why they killed their men. John C. Reilly's \\"Mr. Cellophane\\" is heartbreaking albeit fabulous, and the final number with Zellweger and Zeta-Jones is a solid finisher.<br />If you have not already heard too much buzz about \\"Chicago,\\" it's worth seeing, preferably before you're plastered with frequent clips on TV around Oscar time.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has a sultry voice that is so relaxing and easy on the ears:) The songs on this CD are all fabulous and in my opinion, the one song that has been played to death on the radio is not a fair representation of Norah's talent. I can hardly wait to hear her next album:)
B00005JL2O|4.0|When I first heard of this movie I found myself saying, &quot;Another Austin Powers movie, whoop-de-doo Basil.&quot;  I had always liked the other two, but I just couldn't see anything funnier being added to the Austin Powers frachise.  I was dead wrong.<br />Goldmember is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!  I don't usually laugh out loud during movies, but I did so multiple times on this one.  It was just plain hillarious!  &quot;Welcome to my underwater sub.  It's long, hard and full of seamen!&quot;<br />&quot;After saying that, I do have some suggestions.&quot;  Despite it's comedy, there is some flaws.  The main plot wasn't the best and wasn't consentrated on.  The deal with Austin's dad was very good, but the rest of the plot didn't get very much attention.  The first two had very good plots and funny parts, while Goldmember is full of funny and has some good plot parts.  Also, the ending wasn't quite satisfying.  There was something in the end that happened in the first two but not in Goldmember.  Oh well.<br />All in all Goldmember is an extremely funny movie and worth every minute.  The new cast members are good and worthy of the Austin Powers franchise.  I just thought that Foxxy and Austin should have had a closer relationship.  I mean they were supposed to have been going out earlier, they didn't have to go through all the flirting and slow movements again.  Oh well.  It's a great movie if you want a good laugh and I highly recommend it.
B000000WIG|3.0|A pale copy of \\"Still got the blues\\". But \\"Cold day in hell\\" is a great song. The rest isn't bad, it's just that you've heard it all so many times before - but that's the nature of the blues.
B000088E6M|5.0|It's about time that a REAL and true hip hop album has received so much prestige in the industry, in so many years.  I've been tracking 50 Cent for years since \\"How to Rob\\", and I hope he, G-Unit, and other up and rising underground artists (like Royce Da 5'9 or M.O.P.) finally make it to the commercial world and put an end to this bubblegum and R&b-Rap  BS.  When Ja Rule has like 4 songs in rotation, something has to be going wrong. About the album: its a great album with one of my favorites being \\"Many Men\\". However, unless you listen to it more than once, you may not find one song that sticks out as a definite classic.  I have to admit tho, that even though I like this album as a whole better, I like some of the individual songs on his previously unreleased albums/mixtapes better (some of which are included as bonus tracks).
B000002KLQ|4.0|\\"Making movies\\" is Dire Straits' best album, and the opening song \\"Tunnel of love\\" is without doubt the best Dire Straits song ever. In fact I believe it's one of the better songs in rock history and that means a lot! \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", \\"Hand in hand\\" and \\"Solid rock\\" are other highlights on this release. <br />Old time fans of Dire Straits will most certainly already have this album in their collection, but if you're unfamiliar with this band I strongly suggest you buy \\"Making movies\\" first, then go back to their debut simply titled \\"Dire Straits\\". These two albums will do for the less dedicated fan...

B00005JL3A|5.0|If you want to know the story, read the editorial review.  Here's why I liked this film and what you should expect when viewing it;<br />-This is a quality horror film. Not one cheep scare in the whole movie.  Some may be disappointed by the lack of gore.<BR>-Special effects are not gratuitous. They are there to enhance believability and they work well.<BR>-This is not close to the same level of \\"Alien\\". It's less sophisticated than that.. more \\"in your face\\".<BR>-The gore is actually quite tame. No spilling intestines etc. (Sorry).<BR>-Mila Jovovich is becoming an excellent action heroin. First \\"Fifth Element\\" now this.<BR>-The pace is relentless. I re-viewed scenes repeatedly because so many details are missed in casual viewing. They left few stones unturned.<BR>-The \\"laser room\\" scene is one of the most intense scenes in horror movie history. <BR>-Not high art (are you surprized?),  Just high entertainment.  I was on edge from the beginning.<BR>-Acting is better than expected for a film of this genre.<BR>-Good extras on the DVD.  I was still on edge watching THEM!!<BR>-Sound and picture are first-rate.  <BR>-This was on my \\"must have\\" list after renting. <BR>-Pay attention to the color of this film.  It is remarkable<br />My biggest problem with Game-to-Film translations is the \\"Gamer Expectations\\".  As with LOTR geeks that have unreasonable expectation, RE fans should approach this as a separate but related piece of work.  This film is highly under-rated.  If in doubt, rent it first.  A non-gamer like me got sucked in.  Just take it for what it is.

0312305060|5.0|The film version of Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning book \\"The Hours\\" has just garnered nine Academy Award nominations. I have yet to see the movie, but if it has stayed true to this book, I think it has more than a chance to take home Best Picture honors.<BR>I'm sure the movie trailers have already mapped out that this is a story of three women from different time periods who are connected somehow. This connection is the heart of the story, and the promise of discovering it is what keeps you reading.<BR>The storytelling is descriptive, which is not everybody's cup of tea. But Cunningham uses subtlety to build the plot, sneaking in points here and there just to make sure you are paying attention. It all comes together brilliantly, but uniquely. Some authors tend to throw a twist at readers, shocking them. Cunningham folds in the connection in such a way that you should have known it all along. And I'm NOT talking about the fact that all of the ladies link to Virginia Woolf. <BR>This book is wonderful, touching prose. It is also very methodically put-together. For example, Cunningham's story alternates between time periods. For Virginia Woolf's time period, his writing takes a classical turn (in other words, illustrative and fancy). For Laura Brown's part of the story, his writing is more conservative and simple, much like the era of post-World War II itself. Finally, for Clarissa's tale, he chooses a more modern style reflected in many of today's novels, resembling everyday speech. <BR>\\"The Hours\\" is a refreshing addition to modern literature and truly deserving of its praise. If the Hollywood version sells more copies of the novel, then that's great. More people will discover why this one is destined to become a classic.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|For those of us who have read the novel by Sylvia Nasar, this movie will come as a complete surprise. I remember sitting in the theatre in complete confusion thru portions of the film. The confusion, however, was finally replaced by the realization of what the makers of this movie were trying to do.<br />The 3 imagined characters were pure fiction and much of the movie was highly fabricated. The film also entirely omitted the object of Nash's first affair, Eleanor, as well as the son he fathered by her, John David.<br />As all good movies do, this film had its reasons for proceeding thus. The story is about Nash's courtship and marriage of Alicia. It was during this period in his life that he experienced his biggest bouts with mental illness, which is also central to the theme. To have included Eleanor and John David would have made the movie much longer and the film would have lost its focus.<br />As for Nash's illness itself, to give an accurate account would have made the film wander about without any real direction (which is exactly what Nash himself DID do for several years). The 3 fictional characters are installed to bring the film a cohesive plot as well as a storyline with a considerable degree of symmetry.<br />Ron Howard does an outstanding job directing this film. The cast, featuring Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and Jennifer Connoley, is magnificent. Particularly impressive is Crowe as this role is so very different from his notable performance in GLADIATOR.<br />This is a film that I would recommend everyone adding to their DVD collection. Movies about the lives of atheletes are commonplace, but films that detail the stories of intellectuals are exceedingly scarce. For that reason alone, I would admonish all persons to watch this movie.<br />Ultimately, this movie is a REPRESENTATION of Nash's life as opposed to a glossing over of actual events. However, in Hollywood, as well as storytelling in general, style is something that may trump veracity. For those who want the full story I recommend Nasar's book by the same name.veracity. For those who want the full story I recommend Nasar's book by the same name.
1573229725|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars, I would.  This book combines all my favorite themes.  If you liked the Wilke Collins classic, &quot;The Woman in White,&quot; then you'll love this.  Of all this book's many virtues, the most powerful is the incredible writing. Nothing is more satisfying to me than a well written book, rich with intense and complex characters, and an intersting plot. This book has it all, along with the best victorian foils of mistaken identity, villains, mad-houses, dark country estates, and London itself which give this book rich texture and detail. The love story is unique and gratifying.  You will not be disappointed!  I could not put this book down, and am forlorn now that it is finished. (I fear I shall never find another book so wonderful as this!)
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I picked this up from Amazon after seeing Dylan in concert recently in Upstate NY. If you're a longtime Bob fan, you'll be glad to hear that the MAN IS BACK! Of course, you probably already knew that, but I digress...<br />If you're new to Dylan, you won't be disappointed. This is as good a starting place as any.<br />There isn't a bad track on this album (yes, I still call them albums...so sue me), and some of it is positively stunning. With clever lyrics and a kick-... backing band, you can't go wrong with this one.
B00006G8O1|4.0|Sometimes before I write a review I read through other viewers ones to help jog my memory, I especially like reading all the one-star reviews; but I was a bit bewildered by some one star reviews of this as DONNIE DARKO is one of THE most original films I have seen in the past year.<BR>Jake Gyllenhaal gives a mesmirising performance as the title character (yes, that is his real name), a teenager blessed with intelligence and a vivid imagination; but who is seen by his peers and teachers as a bit strange. Things get more bizzare when Donnie's bedroom is destoyed by an airplane engine, his delusions make him believe this is a sign that the world will end in 28 days. Over this period while he is waiting, Donnie's behaviour starts getting more eccentric... and he's stopped taking his medication.<BR>That's about as much as I will say about DONNIE DARKO, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The recipient of numerous awards, the movie is a triumph for all involved, especially Drew Barrymore who co-produced the film through her company Flower Films, who also has a small part as a teacher. Patrick Swayze is surprisingly good as a motivational speaker who incurs Donnie's wrath. Keep your ears open for the \\"Smurfs\\" conversation. A must see.

0440539811|5.0|Many things can be said about Shea's and Wilson's Illuminatus! trilogy. It is not immune to literary criticism, except for its blatently self-acknowledged frivolity. This is a very crafty prophylactic device, leaving critics and apologists alike to identify their own preoccupations in relation to the material content and style of the novel.<br />More importantly, this work presents, through its phenomenally colorful cast of characters and imaginative themes and events, a veritible cornucopia of historical facts and thoughts about the real life of politics, religion, metaphysics, psychology, crime, fanaticism, conservativism, liberalism, etc., and behind-the-scenes activities, real and imaginable, of the major institutions of global culture and civilization.<br />The full reading of this epic novel forces the reader to assimilate such a complex amalgamation of diverse and conflicting, subtly interacting currents of thought and action that it would seem that no imaginable position is left unsatirized. Ultimately, this enables the reader more clearly to understand one's own thoughts and actions within the context of the full blown dimensions of our tumultuous modern/postmodern world.<br />The information download alone makes this book well worth the reading. The great humor employed in the characterizations and blending of known facts and prominent personages makes the assimilation of this historical knowledge a most delightful experience. Victims of our national school systems in America and elsewhere can easily remedy that deficiency to a great degree by the reading of Illuminatus!

B000084T18|5.0|I've never been a big 50 cent fan, I always thought he had a tight flow but earlier on in his career I never really heard him rhyme about anything tight.  I guess life and pain and feeling to art because he's been killing the Mix tapes and to top it off, this album is Hot!! There are only 2 songs on it I don't really like and that's because I don't really like the beats. To sum it up this album is making a good case for an early career classic. Easily the Hottest street ablum out now! God Son is Hot, but just on volume of song that bang this album edges Nas! Point blank...buy this album you won't be disappointed!!!
B000088E6M|5.0|50 Cent's 2nd album \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" is worthy of all the hype surronding it. Finally 50 has got the backing (Aftermath/Shady), and the beats needed to make an excellent album. 50 has come a long way since \\"How to Rob\\", remember first hearing him on \\"In Too Deep Soundtrack\\" and I knew then he would blow one day. Underground for a long time, nice to see him drop an album commerically, and see that he hasnt sold out on anything. Executive Produced by Dr.Dre and Eminem, with guest appearances coming from Em, G-Unit members- Young Buck, Tony Yayo and Lyoyd Banks, and the king of sick R&B hooks Nate Dogg. Ninteen tracks total including intro and 3 bonus tracks. Standout tracks for me at the moment are: \\"Patiently Waiting\\" Feat. Eminem, \\"Many Men\\", lead single \\"In Da Club\\", \\"High All the Time\\", \\"If I can't\\" and the relaxed banging \\"21 Questions\\" feat. Nate Dogg\\" and the adrenaline laced \\"Gotta Make it to Heaven\\". The 3 bonus tracks \\"Wanksta\\" (8 Mile soundtrack), \\"U Not Like Me\\" and \\"Life's on the Line\\" close off the album well. Full of tight Production, entertaining lyrics and blazing beats \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" is one of those albums people are going be bumping for years to come.

B00005QDW1|5.0|I always thought labels on music was bad...and I still do.  Older No Doubt fans seem to think this album stinks because it isn't &quot;ska&quot; enough, but No Doubt have even said themselves that they didn't want to be labeled a ska-band.  I think on &quot;Rock Steady&quot; No Doubt have served up some new dishes on their menu.  I loved &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; and couldn't take &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; out of my CD player.  it's no doubt that I have fallen in love with the new album as well.  &quot;True&quot; No Doubt fans who don't pigeon-hole bands into one category will like this album.
B000000H8B|5.0|The best. Out of all of their releases, Beneath is easily the best of them all, closely followed by Arise. Heavier riffs and vocals than Metallica, they were the premier Heavy Metal band of their day. Each song flows from one to the next with perfect synchronicity, with the opening howl of the title track to one of the best riffs ever recorded on Inner Self, they continuously amaze me. The album gets better each time I listen to it. Better chords than Slayer, heavier vocals than Metallica make Sepultura the best Metal band in the last 20 years. Buy this and Arise, and the two albums will change your life forever.

Avril has a great voice that really suits her musical style.  I'm impressed with the honesty and lack of pretension in her work.  My favorite song is Sk8er Boi and I would like to see more of these up tempo songs on her next album.  Definitely worth the money.
6303477259|5.0|I will most likely never see Pink Floyd in concert in my lifetime.  So I'm glad I own this!  We get to hear much of the The Division Bell tunes accompanied with some cryptic interpretable images on the big round video screen.  We get to hear the entire Dark Side of the Moon which is a pleasure to hear in comparison to the studio version that he have all most likely played countless times.  We get to hear wonderful encores Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb, and Run Like Hell.  I don't believe there is a single moment on this video that falls flat.  We get to see David Gilmour's guitar skills up close without losing the impact of the intense light show that is being projected at us.  I wish I were there in person, but this and the upcoming DVD (?) will be as close as I'll get.
B00006IR5S|4.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is my favorite Harry Potter book, and now the music is. Yes, they have some of the same old songs but they are played a bit diffrently. John Williams wrote some beautiful and outstanding music for this film. The Spiders is my personal favorite on the soundtrack. I'm the person who likes there soundtrack music to be loud and fearful. Dueling the Basilisk is alright ,but for me it's only good when your watching the movie. <br />Fawkes The Phoenix is a wonderful theme. I can picture it being played in a ball room. Gildory Lockarts theme well lets just say I'm laughing the whole time. I really like the music for the flying car especially ( if your watching the movie and listening to the music) the few seconds when there first revealing Hogwarts with the loud choir. I do wish they would have added Hedwigs Theme because there is a part in that song that is my favorite Harry Potter music out of both soundtracks. Also I don't know how many people pay attention to the music when there watching the movie in the theatre, but I would have given Chamber of Secrets five stars if they had the Quddidicth Match song on it. Because there is a few moments ( when Harry and Draco are flying through the trench)  were John Williams puts in almost the exact same music form The Chase Through Curasont on EPISODE 2. <br />Overall it is an outstanding soundtrack. Sadly this might be the last time you read Music Composed By John Williams because based off of what I've hearded someone else will write the music for The Prisoner of Azkaban. Hopefully it will be Williams Ross who would oddviously be the best choice since it was he who rewrote the songs and put them on the soundtrack.

The best are the other forteen ones. \\"Endorphinmachine\\" is Prince's wildest hours. \\"Gold\\" sometimes make me cry (really). \\"I Hate U\\" starts soften just to break through a powerful guitar solo to engage the title song... Prince at his best.<br />Just a masterpiece and a must have.

B00005JLXC|4.0|\\"Lawyer by day, judge and jury by night.\\"<br />Like many superheroes before him, Matt Murdock leads a double life.  In one of those lives, he defends the innocent in court.  In the other he is known as the Daredevil, a vigilante who takes the law into his own hands and punishes those that take advantages of the loopholes in the justice system.  The unique thing about Murdock is that he is blind, an unfortunate result from a childhood chemical accident.  To compensate the loss of sight, the rest of his four senses are consequently heightened to help him navigate his environment, acting like radar that works in a similar way to the bat sonar. <br />\\"A man without fear is a man without hope.\\"<br />Surprisingly, Daredevil isn't a simple crime fighting fare or a showcase of good vs. evil.  Beneath those familiar themes is a struggle with the meaning of justice and revenge.  As expected, the obligatory introduction for the protagonist is there for the benefit of those that are not familiar with the comic.  Even though one can't really fault these sequences for being formulaic (i.e. guy gets hurt, guy obtains superhuman abilities, and guy learns how to perfect these skills), suffice to say the movie does an adequate job of presenting the character of Daredevil to the audiences.<br />I admit to having doubts when hearing Ben Affleck is to don the costume as Daredevil, he just does not look like the superhero type to me.  However, as the film progressed, I became more and more convinced that while he may not be perfect for the role, he did a fantastic job with it.  Affleck was able to translate Murdock's loneliness, his playfulness and his inner struggles to the screen.  He is a complex hero filled with the most basic of human needs, he is as fallible as you and me, and he does not always make the right choices.  The lovely Jennifer Garner plays the tough and resilient Elektra, Murdock's love interest in the movie.  I really appreciate the time taken to develop their relationship with each other, and the chemistry between the two leads is definitely there.<br />The characterizations of the villains, on the other hand, were rather weak.  This is not to say that the performances by Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin and Colin Farrell as Bullseye were bad, but little screen time were devoted to them to flesh out these personalities, which could be the intention of the director for all we know.  Nevertheless, the supporting cast is a strong one; I especially liked Jon Favreau in the part of Murdock's good-humored partner, Franklin Nelson.  <br />The veteran Hong Kong master Cheung-Yan Yuen (brother to Woo-Ping) provides the action choreography, evident in the amount of wirework present in the movie.  Personally, I think the film benefited from such collaboration, and it certainly made the fighting sequences much more exciting and stylish to watch.  However, some of the editing of the said scenes left a lot to be desired, for example, the confrontation in the bar at the beginning was hectic and poorly lit, it is hard to appreciate what you cannot see.<br />Not a comic reader myself, I cannot say whether Daredevil is a faithful adaptation of the source material, but I can tell you that I enjoyed every minute of it.  The movie is not without faults, yet I truly believe that it is everything Spider-Man was and more.  It has action for the guys and romance for the women, come to think of it, Daredevil may not be a bad choice to spend part of your Valentine's Day.  It is fun, charming, and a touch sinister.  I really think Marvel has another success in its hands.  Be sure to sit through the credits, there is an additional scene you don't want to miss.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is fabulous!The battle scenes makes you feel like you are in the war of the Two Towers! Treebeard and the other Ents was very funny ,and the return of Gandalf was surprising. Overall, the movie was action-pacted and the music was breath taking. I loved this film and definatly think that it is THE best movie around to this very day. See it, you'll be totally blown away.
B00005JL78|4.0|Steven Spielberg made one of his best films since The Lost World. Minority Report is a great suspenseful story that pulls you in until the very last frame. When I grow up I want to become a director. I have been watching Spielbergs work since Jurassic Park ,and Minority Report reminds me of why I like Steven Spielberg. The film is by far Spielbergs most darkest film. It does'nt look like a Speilberg film the first time you watch it but then later you start to see bits and pieces. It's a great thrill ride but not what most people think and that's due to the trailer.<br />The trailer makes the film look like a big action movie, but If you count them up there's only four or five action scenes. The film is mainly a drama. And there is great character development. For me this is almost a pefect film. Tom Cruise character is an amazing character. This is the first Tom Cruise movie I've ever seen and he was pretty good. Colin Farrel plays an amazing FBI agent out to catch Tom Cruise.<br />The lighting is amazing. The score is unforgettable. The only down side is the DVD they don't have has many behind the scenes fottage as one might expect. And once again no commentary.This is one of the best crime films since who knows when. I like it so much that I hope that the Academy of Arts and Science think about it for an Oscar especially for Best Cinematography( Januzs Kaminski), Best Musical Score ( John Williams) Best Supporting Actor (Colin Farrel/ Max Von Sydow ), Best Director (Steven Spielberg), and best Picture Minority Report. I highly recommend this picture especially if your a Spielberg fan.
0316666343|5.0|It has been a while since I have been so profoundly moved by a novel.  This is a beautifully written, wonderfully realized book that will haunt readers long after they close the cover.  It is witty and wise, sad and funny, challenging and simple.  I counsel many people who are grieving for lost loved ones and grief is seldom depicted with such understanding and insight as here.  This is a novel I will not forget and the people in it are etched in my memory forever.  When I finished the last page I found myself saying &quot;thank you.&quot;  I envy those who will be touched by this wonderful, intensely emotional novel for the first time.
B000088E6M|5.0|It's about time! This is exactly what Hip-Hop needed right now.  Take a step back from all the &quot;Bling Bling&quot;,&quot;Gansta Love Duets&quot; and all of that nonsense that true Hip-Hop lovers as had to deal with for the past years. It's been a minute, but this Album is a true resurrection of Hip -Hop. Thank You 50! <BR>P.S. Stop comparing this cat to other artist and respect what he's bringing to the table.
B00003CX8J|5.0|The first in a possibly long \\"X-Men\\" movie franchise is a great but flawed movie and it is one of the one of my favorite movies of 2000.<br />It starts with a young teenage boy by the name of Eric Lensherr who struggles against the Nazi during WWII and his powers manifest for the first time in his life when he manages to warp and damage a gate to a concentration camp before being knocked unconscious. It is not seen however but Lensherr escapes however and would eventually meet Charles Xavier. Their friendship would eventually continue sort of in a way but at the same time, it would turn into a bitter rivalry as prejudice against mutants worsens and worsens and Xavier seeks to mend the rift between normal humans and mutants while Lensherr on the other hand, believing that humans will never accept mutants into their society, seeks to wage an all-out war against them and rid the world of them. In this flick, Magneto has plotted a special machine that irradiates a force field that mutates normal human cells and the normal human body rejects the mutations and dissolves into water while mutants are completely unscathed. Also, Wolverine escapes a military testing compound with little or no memory of his time there.<br />The cast of the film is hit and miss, not by the actors themselves but simply how some of them act out their character roles.<br />The best ones for their characters are Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, and Sir Ian McKellan as Magneto.  Hugh Jackman has the right kind of expressions that would remind one of Wolverine from the 1992-1996 cartoon series. Patrick Stewert does a wonderful job playing Xavier, I would even go far as to say that Stewert IS Charles Xavier. Sir Ian McKellan cannot be outdone playing the master of magnetism Magneto and has the right kind of sinister voice that would definitely scare young kids. All three of these actors give solid performances and they alone steal the show with their skillful performances in this movie. Rebecca Romijn Stamos' does a good job in her role as Mystique which will be forever remembered with the 'costume' merely being blue body paint and the bizarre stick-on scales to make Mystiques course skin and it's probably Stamos' most famous role in her entire career. Interesting camera angles I must admit.<br />Others though don't fare as well. While none of them are near horrible or fatally catastrophic, some characters should've been giving much larger roles and could've been much better both appearance wise and personality wise. Rogue, Storm, and Cyclops are among the best characters off all time but in the film, they are reduced to two-dimensional characters with Rogue and Storm being the particular ones as the comic books show them as beautiful, intelligent, and elegant, but on the film they hardly show any of the elegance nor intelligence that they have been in the comics for almost 40 years! Anna Paquin doesn't do a bad job playing Rogue but her character hardly shows Rogue's emotional trauma that the comics have showed time and time again and simply looks more like a helpless victim. Sabertooth while awesome looks more like the bearded lead singer in the rock band Metallica (No offense to the band). Jean Grey looks more romantically involved with Wolverine than with Cyclops. What's with that? Cyclops is almost as uninteresting as your average stranger and hardly shows the romantic relationship with Jean Grey.  All of these characters in my opinion are in dire need of improvement on their part especially Storm and Rogue. However, all of these flaws in the characters I mentioned are forgivable in my opinion, considering how difficult it was to adapt a HUGE and rich comic book series to the big screen and it could've turned out disastrous, but instead they pulled it off quite well. There's lots of room for improvement though and hopefully the cast will do an even better job on X-Men 2.<br />Although I'm not complaining about it, somecharacters don't even show up in the film at all. Gambit doesn't join the X-Men until much later, Henry McCoy aka Beast doesn't either, nor does Jubilee. That's OK though. Gradually the X-Men movies shall improve upon the previous as time goes on and hopefully it'll have a long theatre life as opposed to the Batman movie series that probably wound up being killed by the box-office bust, \\"Batman & Robin\\".<br />Although I love this movie a lot, even I cannot deny that there were plenty of flaws to the film. Despite all of these things, this movie is a great one to own and has a strong message of the effects of bigotry, prejudice and racism and it's destructive effects on society as a whole. The fight scenes in some of them are awesome especially Wolverine battling Sabertooth atop The Statue Of Liberty and the incident at the train station. Overall, while this movie could've been better. This is just my perspective but I think that this first X-Men movie is more of a warm-up to the possible action-packed sequel X-Men or the ones after it. I just hope that this will become like a long lasting movie series that'll go for years and years. I think that they did a good job at adapting the X-Men to the big screen and is a good first start.

B00000IUT7|4.0|I bought two red locomotives (not at the same time) because I thought that two batteries would be better than one. Wrong. The yellow engine has been the longest functioning. The green one broke down but I suppose this can happen to any toy. The red locomotives are too long, too heavy to go up steep slopes, they often slip. The screw is too far deep and I always think this is the last time I will be able to unscrew it! Buy the engines instead!
6301955595|5.0|Provacative and lurid, this surreal masterpiece offers a complex tug-of-war between illusion and reality.  Between dreams and the senses.  Once begun, you will not look away until the finale.  And then you think about this film for a long, long time.  Outstanding!

B00005JKLZ|4.0|Despite I read the story of \\"The Time Machine\\" many years ago, it was still fresh in my memory when I watched this movie. Of course I was expecting some changes to adapt the original story to both a screen and to us viewers of this century, but I was somehow surprised when the movie showed its *reason* to build the time machine up. This was not in the original story.<br />However, this did not affect badly the flow of the story, but all the opposite: it was not only the reason to build up the machine, but also the reason for almost every thing that happens in the movie.<br />The middle part is just nice. The director's efforts to adapt the story for our time have a good outcome. Oh, and the movie gets somehow back to the book.<br />At the end I was again expecting some changes but then there was a big, big one; but a good one. You could say it's another story, but you will enjoy it.
B000002B2T|5.0|If you liked any of the more mellow Alice in Chains or Jerry Cantrell stuff (sap, jar of flies) then you are gonna love this one!! \\"Above\\" flew under the radar during its release, but the songs on here are timeless as Layne Stanley's dark haunting voice cuts through to anybody's deepest fears. The chorus of \\"I'm Above\\" rips through like a one of Zeppelin's rock ballads. The jazzy \\"aritificial red\\" and the somber \\"long gone day\\" offer a change of pace for listeners not into the classic AIC songs. Crank it up for \\"lifeless dead\\" and \\"i don't know anything\\" because you are really going to feel the pain and be moved by this whole album. Essential for any fan of modern rock of the past 10 years.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is one spectacular Album from the remaining members of two awsome bands. What people must do when listening to this album is totally forget about each members past bands. As hard as that may be, you must, to fully appreciate this work of musical art. I admit I had preconvieved notions as to the sound of this album. I was the biggest RATM in the world and god knows when you have tom, brad and tim busting out the music you go in with an idea of the sound. What these four musicians have done is create a totally new sound unique to them, leaving their old ways and creating something new and beautiful. You have it all on this disk. Hard Rocking Sonic Assaults(Cochise, Show Me How to Live, Set It Off) to Beautiful Power Ballads(Like A Stone, I Am the Highway) There's nothing like this out there, get it, play it, you won't regret it. Can't Wait to see these guys in concert!

044651652X|1.0|If you want to have a good laugh, please read this book. It was so incredibly bad that it is a parody of itself. The author/main character is so conceited and narcissistic (One scene that cracked me up was when a gorgeous model sniffs that basically she can't get close to him because he is too deep, brooding - HELLO! Can this be anymore silly? Talk about a male fantasy!) I believe a parody of this was written called \\"The Ditches of Edison County\\" but there really isn't any need to read that because you'll laugh just as much reading this rubbish.
B00005Y228|5.0|just a quick review... this is a great album! nearly all the songs are catchy and dont get old, in fact they grow on you... the quality of the mixes are excellent as well. its a good buy if you like dance/pop.<BR>-L8

B000001EUP|4.0|First out, although this isnt Scorpions best album, its surely one of the toughest. The energy just seems to burst out of every second, and although Klaus Meine had undergone an operation right before the album he sounds just awesome. He prooves his newfound power with the memorable title song &quot;Blackout&quot;, which also is the best song on the record. Other highlights on this album is Arizona, When the Smoke is going down and You give me all I need. The other songs are generally good, and there is no bad songs here. However, this is not as good as Love at First Sting, which combines the best elements from both cd`s, hard and fast hitting songs with great melodies. <br />I wasnt sure wether or not to rate this 5, but since it lack the perfection of Love at First Sting, It will have to do with a 4. A STRONG 4 however, as this is very, very good Scorpions as we all love them.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I watched this movie while tripping on acid with spider monkeys.<BR>I thought it rocked!
6304981635|5.0|There's an expression,\\"cream always rises to the top\\",and this movie is a perfect example of that.Bruce Lee started out in a tv role as a crime fighting sidekick/butler.Not to happy about the way the chinese were portrayed,he strived to break that mold.He had a thought for a new show where he was the lead and could showcase his talents.Kung Fu was the name of the show and Bruce Lee was turned down due to being chinese.Since then,he became well known in the martial arts circuit for his amazing speed and power.Slowly but surely convincing martial artists on economy of motion and to be free from styles that slow down combat effectivness.Bruce Lee broke into films and worked relentlessly to prove he could be a successful leading man.The first two,Fists of Fury and The Chinese Conection were cheaply done but classic movies that displayed Bruce Lee's awesome kung fu ability.In Return of the Dragon,Bruce had control to show how real combat should be.This is seen at the fight with Chuck Norris as Bruce switches to his own way of fighting hence,the original title,Way of the Dragon.The next film,Game of Death had to stop production only after a few fights scenes were made.After Bruce's death,the movie was completed and although the combat with him was great,the rest ended up being a disrespectful mess.I recomend picking up the dvd just released called,A WARRIOR'S JOURNEY.It has the extra footage of these combat scenes the way Bruce intended.Now,as for the movie in review.Enter the Dragon started in production after Game of Death was halted.This movie shows Bruce Lee at his best,showcasing his explosiveness through his own art of combat,Jeet Kune Do.The plot has him infiltrating an island to stop an evil ruler from drug traficing,prostitution and to exact punishment on a henchman for killing a relative.The acting is cheesy,but in a cool way.The casting could've been better like Chuck Norris,instead of John Saxon.You can see that every thing was done better like the location,sound,and action.This is a movie that never gets old,as it permenantly captures a true master that will always be remembered.His skill has yet to be out done.
0375703861|3.0|\\"White Teeth\\" by Zadie Smith is about history, multicultural northern London, gender and the difficulties for people to understand eachother. This could have been an interesting novel but I wasnt too impressed. As there are too many characters figuring in the story I dont feel like I get to know anyone of them properly. They almost turn into stereotypes, unfortunatly. But I think Smiths talent is in her narration, the language is witty and expressive like a painting made by sparkling colors. So I would not be surprised to find better novels by her in the future.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Another big hoorah for Miyazaki. Like many of Miyazaki&#146;s previous films, Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi), is an artistic masterpiece. Spirited Away follows in a long line of wonderfully original storylines along with the unique animation distinguished with other Studio Ghibli films. The storyline is so very original and was very well put together. And the animation was flawless. The movie takes you on an adventure that you&#146;ve never experienced. Spirited Away is about a girl named Chihiro, who after arriving in the other world has her name stolen by the sorceress who rules the realm. She is then given the name Sen. The story is about Sen&#146;s journey of finding herself and becoming Chihiro again. The emotions of what Chihiro feels fuel your own emotions. I cried when she cried, I was happy when she was happy. Chihiro seems so much like a real girl, what with the way she acts. The movie also included real life elements.  The movie may also be confusing for those of you who don&#146;t know much about eastern Asian culture, since Miyazaki included some beliefs in the movie.  Also, following the tradition of many of Miyazaki&#146;s other films, the theme music for the movie is beautifully orchestrated. I also recommend watching it in its original Japanese content. There&#146;s just something special about the original thing. Other movies by Miyazaki that I recommend you watch would include Totoro and Mononoke Hime. For those of you who have already seen Totoro, you&#146;ll be delighted to see the return of those cute dust balls ^_^
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is a must-buy CD for anyone who loves true rock.  The blending of these 2 great bands has formed what has the potential of being a super group in the league of Led Zeppelin and AC/DC.  I have not felt this much excitement towards a band in many years and hope they will be around for many more!
B00006NSZ5|4.0|I purchased this CD after a friend let me borrow it and said \\" hey man I know you like eminem and i think that besides his last CD \\"The Eminem Show\\" 8 mile is the greatest soundtrack and goes awesome with his movie. If I think that everyone that watched his movie and are big fans like me and own every album and movie that he starred in you will probably likely to buy it.
0156907399|2.0|So, To The Lighthouse.  It's a brilliant book, really.  There are points when you're reading this book where you can step back and look at a paragraph or a passage or a chapter and say: THAT'S how a good book should be written, that's how brilliant authors do their thing.<br />Which is why I feel guilty that I hated this book so much.  It was a scant 200 pages, and it took me MONTHS to read; I hated all the characters, hated the writing style, hated everything about the book, which is weird because I completely recognize just how good of a book it was.  It makes me shudder a little bit to think back on it.  If I were forced to reread this book, I actually might start chewing on my wrists.<br />So there it is.  It's a great book, sure, but at the same time, it was horrible.  Can't say I'd recommend it to anyone.  Wish that weren't the case, but it is.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|If you're looking for an emotional Oscar award winning film with dramatic overtones about love lost and emotional distress, I have a message for you - YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE. Go to the chick flick section with your tissue and rent Sweet November.<br />Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is simply unbelievable eye candy entertainment with the sexiest actress in film today. I must say that Angelina Jolie and her lips are very appealing in this film. I don't really know what the movie is about except that Angelina is amazingly hot. (All you ladies who just asked your man if he agrees, and he assures you otherwise should know that your man is a LIER. Whether you are with him or not, he is always thinking about Angelina and how Jolie she is with that bodacious body.)<br />How the heck did Billy Bob get so lucky? He must have big feet.
B00007JMCX|4.0|Anyone purchasing this &quot;Special Edition&quot; will be getting a largely improved print than that of the Fox Lorber DVD version!  True crisp, letterbox vision with a re-mastered soundtrack makes this a worthwhile investment. I'm totally amazed at this print's environment! Textures, framing even the pores of it's actors are in pristine condition. There is absolutely no aged signs of film blemishes or color distortion. Choice of how to hear it's soundtrack  is in three different formats have also been included making the first disc the only &quot;special&quot; feature in this &quot;edition&quot; <br />The second disc however is something less than &quot;special&quot;, with a wealth of information regarding this sci-fi classic being found on the once available  laser disc edition by Criterion that included a Commentary track with Nicolas Roeg, David Bowie, Buck Henry, Deleted scenes analysis with photos and continuity  to costume and set design sketches,  an array of promotional material and rare behind the scenes photography , it's a shame that there is nothing more here than a cheaply done PR press kit, a short 23 minute re-cap with  Roeg, Clark and other principle players who discuss memories of the film like discussing a bad acid flashback and no, David Bowie is not along for the &quot;bumpy ride&quot;.<br />The script is accessible should you have a DVD-Rom drive, a few film stills and poster designs to a trailer gallery which perhaps  is the best this disc has to offer,  brings the &quot;extras&quot; of this disc to a pale comparison making it nothing short of  a wasted piece of plastic. <br />With that said, any fan of this film will be  thrilled by the restored print and sound quality making this the ultimate DVD version of Mr. Roeg's masterpiece of  &quot;Sound and Vision&quot;.
0792838068|5.0|Elizabeth is in fine form for this film. Never found her too attractive until I saw her dressed up as a whore. Some very good visuals of her in this film which I highly recommend.<br />You are able to sympathize with both Ben and Sera, despite the paths they have chosen. Nicholas Cage was amazing and brilliant. No wonder why he won an Academy Award for his performance. You really buy into the fact that he is this sad character who wants nothing more but to destroy himself by the only thing that can bring him some sense of false happiness. Shue is also terrific in her role and should be applauded as well. The two are explosive as a team and can really bring the house down.<br />As for the DVD, you can have your choice of either watching the movie in widescreen or full screen. The picture for the most part looks good; not the best, but good. The main special feature this DVD offers is a trailer for the film and a bonus secret page. It would be nice if they decided to re-release this in a more superior version.<br />\\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" is heartbreaking, but at the same time is satisfying. It's emotionally charged from start to finish. <br />Elizabeth is very hot. She can help me through my alcoholism any time.
0446519456|3.0|I've always loved books that illustrate true-life synchronicity and its wonders. I found ONLY LOVE IS REAL's story of Elizabeth and Pedro to be fascinating. It did not excite me as much as I hoped it would though. It's all in the presentation. I didn't find myself on the edge of my seat and could very well have put the book down if it weren't such a quick read.<br />Nevertheless, pick up a copy if you are into reincarnation. While you're at it, you might also want to check out Dr. Bruce Goldberg's PAST LIVES, FUTURE LIVES. In this more enthralling book is a case very, very similar to (yet MARKEDLY different from) Weiss's Pedro and Elizabeth.

He and Lefty form a strong bond and a father son relationship. When the investigation is coming to an end Joe realizes that his only way out of the mob is to betray his friend. <br />The film is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen. It is a very nice transfer the only flaw I noticed was a hint of grain occasionally. A Dolby Digital 5.0 audio track is provided. The surround speakers are hardly used. When they are its mostly only for music. With a movie like this that is mostly dialogue its understandable. This special edition DVD has several extras. The highlights are a director's commentary, two featurettes, deleted scenes and trailers. The featurette titled &quot;Donnie Brasco: Out of the Shadows&quot; was excellent. It gives a lot of background on the film and contains several interviews with the cast and crew. The deleted scenes are nice to see but I can understand why they were cut from the film.<br />For those of you thinking this is just another mob movie, you are wrong. Instead of showing the top of the crime family tree like many other films this one shows the bottom. It shows soldiers that are scraping at the bottom of the barrel and are just trying to make ends meet. This is a film that stands on its own on many levels. It was perfectly cast with Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche. If you like mob movies or just fine acting this is one film you need to see. <br />One movie that will definately not be forgotten.<br />FEGEDDABOUDITT
B00008977N|2.0|I was so excited to see this performance coming to DVD. It is one of only a few titles left in my Laserdisc collection -- titles I have kept on LD (along with the player!) awaiting their release on DVD because they are absolute must-have discs.<br />Peter Gabriel and Robert LePage collaborated to stage this show, and everything from the elaborate dual-ended stage-in-the-round with lifts and moving sections to the mobile video projection screens to the gorgeous lighting design is first-rate.<br />The show is a visual tour de force, and yet this serves to augment rather than distract from the wonderful music. As a bassist myself, I always love to see and hear Tony Levin play, and this video is no disappointment in that regard. The same can be said for drummer/percussionist Manu Katche, whose rock-solid time anchors the band while his fills and ornamentation will leave you speechless.<br />I could go on and on, but the crux is simple: this had potential to be a must-have DVD.  Sadly, this DVD is a huge disappointment.  I wrote the glowing stuff above based upon the Laserdisc version, which I own, anticipating that the DVD would only improve upon it.  Then, I came back to edit this review after actually receiving the DVD.  I have another review here specifically about the DVD in the feedback area, so I won't repeat that material here.<br />Summary: Find the VHS or Laserdisc if you can.  The DVD doesn't live up to them.
B00002EPJH|2.0|I love Keith Jarrett, but this choice of songs trivializes his talent. To have him play and sing these songs is a travesty.
0446310786|5.0|This is one of my favourite books that I have read!  During the time in USA where segregation was allowed between the Caucasian and African American, we learn through a little girl's views on how fortunate she was to have a father that did not encourage racism.  <br />I'm glad that I had to read this book in English class because we need to learn from the past to not treat people 'differently' because of their skin colour!
B00005JK8K|1.0|I didn't like this movie at all because there was no character development and the battle scenes are not done to look realistic but seem to be constructed to show either explosions or men dieing in creative and dramatic ways. The movie never gripped me and it didn't to have any direction at times. <br />If you are thinking of buying this move do yourself a favor and rent it first.
B00003CXI1|3.0|For those of you that have been living in a cave for the last several years, Harry Potter is a boy-wizard, raised by &quot;Muggles&quot; (non-magical people) who is taken away to a private school for wizards and witches when he turns 11.  The success of J.K. Rowling's books made a film version inevitable, but also a risky venture (2nd only to Lord of the Rings).  Chris Columbus's film stands up well on the surface.  Unfortunately, in a more in-depth analysis, it's not much more than a kiddie movie.<br />In defense of the filmakers, they saw the challenge of this first Harry Potter film as faithfully reproducing the atmosphere and magic of Hogwarts, the school.  This they did admirably well with fantastic sets and a liberal helping of computer-generated images.  Some of the CGI looks cartoony, but I suspect it is to prevent younger viewers from being scared.  Likewise, the characters are faithfully reproduced by the actors - I was especially impressed with Smith as Prof. McGonagall, the teacher who demands a lot, is a strict disciplinarian, but still admired.  We've all known teachers like that, but the performance generates such respect that you totally believe in McGonagall (rather than the screenplay dictating it), even in her rediculous witch hat.  Likewise, Rickman and Harris as Snape and Dumbledore are pretty much exactly as you would picture them from reading the book.<br />However, I have to question the interpretation in places.  The two main misteps (the blame for which I place on director Columbus) are:  1. Harry is far too rebellious and confident in some scenes - to the point of arrogance - which was not Rowling's intention.  2. In filming most of the events of the book, the running time blew up to 150 minutes.  This is not an adaptation so much as a photocopy!  However, if interest was more in the environment than the story, future films will be better (especially as each book gets longer, it will be impossible to film all the events).  All things considered, it's an enjoyable movie, although with limited replay enjoyment.<br />As a special edition 2-DVD set, I was disappointed by the lack of material.  The entire 2nd disc is devoted to little games that are annoying to adults and not fun enough to hold a child's interest.  Especially annoying is the fact that to access the deleted scenes, you have to navigate through many games that give you little direction to solving the puzzles, and that kick you back to the beginning if you choose wrong.  ARGH!  Also, the &quot;making-of&quot; featurette is quite short (16 minutes).  There is no commentary or other extras - why not bring in Rowling for a commentary on how things were adapted?  Therefore, it's a disappointing DVD version of an enjoyable film.
B00000IMCU|1.0|This movie has no real plot or story direction, bad acting, bad special effects and not scary.  I really can't say anything good about this movie; it is hard to believe that someone who made a movie as great as &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; also made this junk.  It is a horrible movie, not just a bad one.  The movie is the classic &quot;bad sequel to a great movie&quot; trap so beware.<br />If this review does not sway you, do yourself a favor - rent it first.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Dream Theater has set the standards for which all musicians should follow! This DVD is outstanding! Even if you are not a musician, but just a fan of true talent, purchase this product. John Petrucci?? What can I say. I'm convinced he's not human!    Enjoy!
B00007KWHP|5.0|&quot;Fragile&quot; was Rick Wakeman's initiation into the symphonic progressive rock of Yes.  This is another of the fine albums Yes released during this time period.  It contains many classic tracks like &quot;Roundabout&quot;, &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot; and &quot;Heart Of Sunrise&quot;.  It also features one of my favorite Yes songs &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot; which features a great example of Steve Howe's angular guitar playing.  However, the album has a more disjointed feel than the previous album perhaps due to the inclusion of solo tracks by each of the band members.  &quot;The Fish&quot; is my favorite of these tracks as it displays Chris Squire's versatility on bass guitar.  Wakeman's keyboard playing is soaring on this album and his vast array of cutting edge (for the times) equipment gives this set a more contemporary feel than the &quot;Yes Album&quot;.  Bill Bruford's drumming is never less than stellar.  Jon Anderson is the quintessential singer for a progressive rock band with his great voice.  The music here while progressive still contains enough hooks to make it memorable for nonprogressive fans which makes it one of their most popular albums. The highlight of this reissue is the inclusion of the full length version of Paul Simon's &quot;America&quot; as a bonus track.  The track contains all the aspects of Yes with great vocals and musicianship and like their first two albums an appropriate cover tune for Yes to (re)arrange.  This remaster also contains an alternate take of &quot;Roundabout&quot; which is somewhat interesting but the differences between this and the released version are minimal. The booklet is impressive with many photos, song lyrics and an essay by Yes expert Bill Martin.  The sound of this remaster is excellent.  It is much clearer than the original compact disk of this release that I already own. Rhino as usual did a great job with this remastered version of &quot;Fragile&quot;. I can't wait until the next batchof Yes remasters is released!
B0000640SA|5.0|For all those cretins out there who rated this movie with one star, what were you thinking? I'll admit half of you are just too ignorant to follow a simple plot line, but what about the other half? Everyone is blowing smoke about how they ruined the movie by revealing all this 'Leonards a dirty killer' at the very end. But if you open your eyes, you'll realize they clued us into the ending constantly during the movie. Why do you think Natalie was so mean to him at first meeting? He was wearing the suit of her boyfriend, and driving his car! Why do you think Teddy was telling him not to trust her all the time? Plain and simple, people who gave this movie a bad review, are probably fans of films such as Scream 3 or Ace Ventura. They dont like a plot line and ending you have to think much about. They just like being told what happened and accepting it, no matter how ridiculous. For fans of intelligent AND highly entertaining movies (im not an art house fan) pick this one up. But if you need to be constantly told whats happening, then I would suggest avoiding it.
B000069HK2|1.0|god, i hate this music....somebody whines over painfully overcompressed guitars and tiny drums.....emo is just shinny clean punk rock (although this guy looks dirty, i'm sure it's all an act, he has set days when he showers each moth, rubs his clothes through a dust storm, etc) with boring, poorly contrived lyrics that sound like a twelve year old wrote them while crying into his notebook. how did a scene started in part by a punk luminary like ian mackaye evolve itself into a spreading virus that threatens to kill punk rock forever in a hail of corporate bid wars....throw this in the garbage, go buy some decent records, maybe the minutemen, fugazi, the wipers, or some other music that is actually punk and not just mindless apathetic drivel.
B00003CXTG|5.0|The Shots of the ocean and ships look as realistic as the day of Infamy was in December 1941.  I later found out that it was computer generated and the graphics do make things look realistic as the real day.  The movie is 3 hours long and at times it becomes bouring.  There are two best friends from childhood days.  One goes to war and is presumed dead, the dead hero's girl becomes girlfried of the other.  Then suddenly the one presumed dead returns back alive only to find out that his girl has become girlfriend of his best friend.  This is adult explicit material fit for Love story like movies rather than Pearl Harbour and too much time being given to it makes it little bouring.   The action scenes of attack and response of attack on Tokyo (as they happened in real life) are superb.<BR>When attacking Tokyo, the carriers have to be withing 400 miles from Japan.  But they are spotted at 640 miles and the split second decision is taken to attack giving aircrafts a low range on fuel to reach safe landing destination in China.  It all happened in real life and we are glad to re live the spirit of brave soilders.
B000002JK4|5.0|It's rather refreshing to see such an accomplished singer as Robert Plant take a step back from the self-indulgent bombasity that marked - and marred - some of Led Zep's later works, and turn out such a fine album as &quot;The Principle of Moments.&quot;  This is a consistent work, full of simple songs well-performed and sung. &quot;In the Mood&quot; still hold up after all these years as an excellent song, dreadfull video notwhithstanding.  There are no real rockers here - all of the songs on this CD are mellow, introspective, generaly pleasent to listen to - again and again.
B00004RF83|5.0|Seven Days in May is a wonderful cold-war suspense drama that looks superb on DVD. It features excellent acting and a truly unique and riveting storyline. The story, written primarily by Rod Serling (he of the Twilight Zone), describes the events leading up to a near-military coup within the U.S. at the height of the cold war. Given that the U.S. represents the largest fully democratic system of government on Earth, a military coup would usually be unthinkable. However, Serling makes the possibility semi-plausible: an unpopular pacifistic president, the threat of nuclear war, and a rising military star who is revered by the joint chiefs.<br />The acting is amazing. Lancaster and Douglas are at their very best here. And Frederic March easily gives the best portrayal of any U.S. president in a movie. He shows exactly the right mix of emotions: you see his leadership skills, his diplomacy skills, and even his own weaknesses. Two amazing scenes stand out: the one between Douglas and March where the coup is revealed and the one between March and Lancaster near the end of the film. Martin Balsam and John Houseman are equally convincing -- the latter actor only appears for a short time onscreen, but milks the time for all its worth.<br />The DVD is worth purchasing for 2 reasons. The picture quality is great and the movie looks crisp in its original 1:85:1 ratio. The second reason is that you get to hear the excellent commentary of the late John Frankenheimer, who goes into extraordinary detail about the scenes. He even relates one story where his ex-wife noticed a set decoration in apartment owned by Ava Gardener's character that Frankenheimer stole from the house they shared together -- it's a total crack up.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Very good concert DVD. Showcases Iron Maidens' triple guitars, driving bass and percussion, and Dickinson's vocals. Excellent picture and sound.
B00005JKZT|5.0|When I saw The Fellowship of the Ring, I was stunned. I honestly could not decide if I liked it or not until it sunk in. I thought I would be prepared for The Two Towers: either love it or be slightly dissapointed. Surprisingly, I had the same feeling. I did not know how I felt about Towers. I couldn't dislike it. And yet I found it very hard to like it.<br />I have finally decided I love it. It is not better than Fellowship. But it just might be as good. The words to describe the first movie would be cathartic, moving, and touching, with an emotional climax. The second movie has a major action climax and is stirring, thrilling, and rousing. While I get choked up and excited by the Fellowship, I feel weary (intentionally) and get chills up my spine in certain scenes. This time around, though, I get a definite feeling of the books. Slightly more how I imagined them, perhaps only because I had seen the first movie.<br />The songs at the end of each movie beautifully describe the film. Enya's 'May It Be' plays during the final credits of The Fellowship of the Ring. It is beautiful but sad, hopeful but lulling. 'Gollum's Song' is sung by a harsh but emotional female voice. It is pretty but depressing, awesome but foreboding.<br />As for the story, Frodo and Sam, two hobbits or halflings, are continuing their journey to Mount Doom to destroy the one ring. They meet up with the slinking gollum, a tragic character addicted to the ring. In another story line, Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor, Legolas, an elven archer, and Gimli, a fighsty dwarf, search for Merry and Pippin, two hobbits captured by the Uruk-hai. The third story line is with Merry and Pippin who meet up with a tree-creature in a lively forest. (It's a terrible summary, but you're just going to have to watch the movies to know what I'm talking about.)<br />Colors are bleak. Music is lovely. By now the characters are so lovable its almost unbearable. I mean, traveling with them through one three hour movie(Fellowship) was tough enough, but now we get to bond with them for three more hours. Elijah Wood is adorable as the burdened ringbearer Frodo gradually slipping into madness and obsession. Viggo Mortensen is fantastic and you realize just how hot he really is as Aragorn. Arwen, Galadriel, and Elrond have cameos and they are all heart wrenching. Sam is lovely, Pippin is cute, Merry is thoughtful, Legolas is whistle-worthy, and Gimli is wonderful.<br />Newcomers include Miranda Otto as a strong Eowyn, Bernard Hill as an okay Theodon, and Karl Urban as a thoroughly convincing Eomer. Andy Serkis as Gollum was, as far as I could tell, flawless. Wormtongue was suitably creepy. The only character I was not immediately satisfied with was Faramir. The actor was fine, but he seemed more sinister than I pictured Faramir as. I have a feeling though that he will be redeemed in Return of the King, because he had the softspokenness and thoughtfullness to pull it off.<br />Anyway. You should check this one out. And see it at least twice - it is better the second time. There is too much to assimilate the first time.
B000059ZLH|3.0|I'm a huge DT fan, and I thought Scenes from a Memory was a monumental achievement in the band's history.  However, this DVD doesn't do the album the justice it deserves, but not because the performance is bad.  The live show is fantastic: tight, full of energy, and fun to watch.  But the actual production of the DVD detracts so much from the performance, that it gets annoying after the first 5 minutes.  Obnoxious phrases from the lyrics flash up on the screen every few seconds, and the special effects such as blurring, multiple camera angles, and cutting away to &quot;reenacted scenes&quot; are way overdone.  <br />I bought this DVD for one reason, and that is to watch the band play their instruments, without having the camera pan away to some other nonsense every 15 seconds.  I didn't expect all this other garbage that they threw in there for who knows what reason.  <br />Now, the Change of Seasons extra bonus was done well- it actually shows the band for more than a few seconds at a time.<br />They could have done much better.
B000084T18|3.0|50 comes out hard with a tight first release from the album &quot;In The Club&quot;.  But one thing that made me mad about the song is that the video had nothing to do with the song.  But beyond that fact, 50 laid down a tight couple of tracks.  My personal favs are &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot;, &quot;High All The Time&quot;, &quot;Don't Push Me&quot;, and &quot;back down&quot;.  50 cent came out of now where to claim his spot in the rap game.  I do give him his props, but overall the cd could of been better.  Lyricism was alright, some beats were hot...but thats all you can say about this album.  As for being a 5 star cd, it falls short.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver I thought was a very good book. It provides us with a glimpse of the good and bad of a utopian society. I would suggest to everyone that you read this book. At first you may not be interested, but it only gets better along the way. The Giver opens up your eyes, and you begin to feel for the main character Jonas, as well as the Giver. You will also begin to have your own feelings about the society Jonas lives in and being released. Therefore, the Giver is an exciting book that everyone will enjoy!
B00004YRQA|5.0|I think this is a very good memory card to use for your PS2.I have this memory card and it works very well.It can hold a bunch of data.Before I brought this memory card I brought a 16MB memory card and it did not work very well so I brought this memory card.Overall I think this it a very good memory card.
6303979882|5.0|A most delightful feel-good comedy about four girls and a summer they'd never forget. Very funny and high-spirited comedy with some sad bits and scary bits. My cousin introduced me to this film and I am quite pleased with it. &quot;Now and Then&quot; is an instant classic from start to finish!
B000002L42|4.0|Reviewers and fans did not exactly go ape over this album.  But after a few years' time, it's clear this is a valuable addition to the Steely Dan discography, because it proves that songs like \\"Aja,\\" \\"Babylon Sisters,\\" \\"Green Earrings,\\" and \\"Josie\\"--which were never performed live at the time of their inception because the Dan never toured then--are highly effective compositions.  The studio versions are great, maybe superior, but there was always the suspicion that they were so fussed over, they would not survive replanting, being performed by different musicians, or airing out.  The studio albums were made by a bunch of control freaks -- brilliant, creative control freaks.  This album is made by a relaxed bunch of great musicians, inhabiting some great compositions that have their own logic and drive.  The sense of revelation going back to one's first hearing of the studio classics?  No, of course not.  But this album is a great source of pleasure for even the casual fan.
6302800927|5.0|I believe this film inspired the more recent film, &quot;Now and Then.&quot; This has four boys searching for a dead body to become famous, but their mission is interrupted when a pack of bullies<BR>finds out! A heartwarming and emotional film. More of a coming-of-age drama, then a coming-of-age comedy, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying it. Excellent!
1559408855|1.0|I saw this film (unfortunately) years ago. I've never forgotten it but you know what? I've never forgotten \\"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\\" either. Pasolini was an angry man from what I've read about him. Fans of this \\"masterpiece\\" defend it as a brilliant satire of fascism, corruption, the Church, commercialism, etc. etc. Bull! This is a movie meant to shock and offend as many people as possible to draw success through controversy and, to call attention to the director's radical political views. I'm not advocating censorship here but if any theater or video store refuses to carry this one, then good for them. Even if this seriously was a satire of whats wrong with society, there are more effective ways of executing it. We really didn't need to see the scenes from the circle of excrement or the final scenes; sometimes what we don't see onscreen is more powerful than what we do. Some reviewers praise the art direction and scoring. Yeah, so what? True the photography and piano music are good but compared to other moments in Italian cinema history, its not \\"La Vita et Bella\\" or \\"Cinema Paradisio\\". Only serial killers and child molesters will get any enjoyment out of seeing this more than once.
B000002J1C|5.0|The arrival of Fragile just eight months after The Yes Album signaled the beginning of the end of innocence for Yes.  Blame it on Rick Wakeman, if you will, but nothing in the Yes canon, save perhaps Drama, is as un-pretentious and downright fun as The Yes Album.<br />The album starts with the classic Yours is no Disgrace.  This song has become a staple of Yes concerts, and rightfully so.  It's the epitome of pre-Topographic innocence.  Fluid key work from Tony Kaye, and seemingly effortless soloing by Steve Howe, wrapped around rumbling rhythm lines by bassist Chris Squire and drummer Bill Bruford.  This song is just plain fun.<br />The song's rising crescendo finale segues into Clap, a little acoustic piece recorded live that shows off Steve's youth and vitality.<br />Then, just as the applause is fading out, we hear the first rising bass line of Starship Trooper sliding in.  This song could be called a precursor to the multi-song suites of Close to the Edge, as the spacey lyrics and virtuoso musicianship foreshadow what is yet to come.  Steve's riff in the second part, Disillusion, will knock your socks off!<br />Next comes Yes' first real &quot;hit,&quot; the sing-along I've Seen All Good People.  Your Move is a lovely little tune with Jon Anderson's poignant lyrics about capturing all you want in life, while All Good People is a crowd-moving rocker that ranks as probably the most adroitly crowd pleasing tune they've ever furnished.<br />After this is Jon Anderson's A Venture, with a more calm, reflective spirit than the songs previous.  Bill Bruford's drumming is very unpredictable here.  Despite everyone's claims that the song is just filler, I enjoyed it a lot.<br />The album closes with it's third near ten-minute piece, Perpetual Change.  Like Starship and Yours, the song is wonderfully arranged and never drags.  The verses sound faintly like a Broadway musical!  And, like Starship, it closes with a manic Steve Howe solo.<br />This is Yes at their most infallible.  No Rolling Stone critic can rightfully bash this album as pretentious in the same league as Tales From Topographic Oceans, Rush's 2112 or Hemispheres, and ELP's Tarkus.  It's a beautiful &quot;starting&quot; point, and these songs would become concert staples for many years to come.
B000060MMI|5.0|I think the words the best describe this album are &quot;woo hoo!&quot;. This cd is sure to offer sock rockin' fun and tunes that make you want to ge up a jig. If i could only choose 5 cd's to listen to for the rest of my life, this would be one of them. Bottom line: buy it, and but it now.
B000002JSN|5.0|In my mind, a better double LP than Physical Graffitti has yet to be created. And that's no small feat, considering its competition--Quadrophenia, Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness, The Wall, The White Album, Electric Ladyland.<br />Instead of shooting for a conceptual work, or showcasing the talents of each individual member of the band, Physical Graffitti is played straight--it is basically one big Led Zeppelin album, showing how far they have come as a group of extraordinarily talented musicians. The team of Plant, Page, Bonzo, and Jones have never played as tightly before or since. Although everything that Led Zeppelin made was great up to this point, Physical Graffitti is Led Zeppelin at their apex.<br />Do not believe those who tell you that this album contains \\"filler.\\" This is typically a hallmark of double LP's, but this album is solid all the way through. People who listen to only the first disc, as classic as it is, are missing some real gems on disc two. There is something for everybody here--mythical rock (In The Light), eastern music (Kashmir), blues (Black Country Woman, By The Seaside), metallic rock (The Rover, Custard Pie) and a sprawling knockout of an epic (In My Time Of Dying). It is baffling that some of these songs were considered outtakes. This is all A-list material by any standard.<br />Favorites--where do I start? If I singled out a few songs I'd feel like I'd be shortchanging everything else.<br />Although I love the others, this is the only double album that I can listen to over and over again. If you are among the deprived souls that don't have this album yet, make this your next purchase. This is also a fantastic place to start if you're looking to introduce yourself to the legend.
B000002JBG|4.0|When I first heard that there was a new movie called Space Jam starring Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny, I was like, \\"Huh?\\" I wasn't really interested in seeing it (it turns out the movie IS pretty good), but I heard from my friends that the soundtrack is pretty decent. I listened to it, and they were right.<br />The soundtrack seems to be PG-rated (if THAT), and it's a good thing because the movie is like that too. But another thing is that it seems to be targeted toward the high school audience (I was 15 when this came out), so if you're over 18, don't expect to be bumping this in your car or anything. This isn't to say the soundtrack is bad. There are great songs like R. Kelly's \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\", Monica's \\"For You I Will\\", and D'Angelo's \\"I Found My Smile Again\\". All-4-One also shows up to sing \\"I Turn To You\\", which most people probably didn't know was recorded before Christina Aguilera's 2000 #3 hit. I like Christina's rendition better, but this version is still good.<br />Since Space Jam is about basketball, it wouldn't be right not to have some energetic tracks on here. B-Real, Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J and Method Man bring us The Monstars' Anthem (the Monstars were the opposing team in the movie), otherwise known as \\"Hit `Em High\\". And the title track, performed by Quad City DJs, is decent, but all their songs sound the same to me.<br />The last song is the humorous \\"Buggin'\\" as performed by Bugs Bunny (and was written by Jay-Z, I must add). Bugs and the other characters are voiced by Billy West (best known as the voice of the Honey Nut Cheerios bee), but at the end of the song it sounds like he's getting lazy with the voice (of Bugs, anyway). And I'm not exactly sure why Robin S. (of \\"Show Me Love\\" fame) is on here, but her \\"Givin' U All That I've Got\\" sounds like her other songs too. But regardless, this soundtrack was a perfect match for the movie. I don't really listen to it that much now, but it's still great.
B00005QDW5|3.0|Echoes: The Best Of Pink Floyd has been badly marketed since its inception. The hardcore Floydians would be dissappointed with the track selections and the lack of rarities, and new fans would probably be better served by buying the original albums.<br />Pink Floyd is emphatically not a compilation band. Each album is in essence a conceptual work, so taking songs out of their original context and order certainly detracts from the music. The Wall, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and to a lesser extent Dark Side Of The Moon were definitely meant to be taken as a cohesive whole, not brief snippets.<br />On the other hand if Gilmour was aiming for a greatest hits collection, this was not the way to do it. Where's the commercially popular tracks like Have A Cigar, Mother, On The Turning Away, and Brain Damage? And if he was aiming for a fan-friendly package, I could've done without Keep Talking, Sorrow, and The Fletcher Memorial Home. If Fearless, Dogs, and If replaced them I would've been ecstatic. When The Tigers Broke Free was a nice addition, and the singles of Arnold Layne and See Emily Play are essential for Syd Barrett fans, but somehow this compilation leaves me and other fans wanting.<br />Furthermore, the ... jobs done to Echoes and Marooned (a great post-Waters instrumental in its full form) are inexcusable. I wouldn't have minded paying extra for a third CD if they had gone with the full lengths of these songs and thrown in more material.<br />However all is not lost, for Echoes does have its merits. The way these tracks run together using ambient sound (like they often do on a Pink Floyd album) is a nice approach and almost makes it sound like a concept album in itself. I also like the way this collection starts and ends with a Syd Barrett composition. In this way, Echoes is intended to be a look at Pink Floyd's career throughout the psychedelic and whimsical Barrett period, the Gilmour and Waters heyday that the band is most remembered for, and the post-Waters incarnation of the last two decades. Most of the selections are solid, and I was surprised (in a good way) to see Set The Controls For The Heart Of Sun and Jugband Blues from the oft-overlooked Saucerful Of Secrets included here.<br />People new to Pink Floyd should NOT start here. Buy Dark Side Of The Moon, The Wall, Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, Wish You Were Here, and even Meddle over this. If you're a fan interested in kicking back for a couple of hours and listening to the history of Pink Floyd unfold, Echoes might be your cup of tea. But it could've been so much better...ters incarnation of the last two decades. Most of the selections are solid, and I was surprised (in a good way) to see Set The Controls For The Heart Of Sun and Jugband Blues from the oft-overlooked Saucerful Of Secrets included here.   <br />People new to Pink Floyd should NOT start here. Buy Dark Side Of The Moon, The Wall, Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, Wish You Were Here, and even Meddle over this.

0060521880|5.0|Coraline, by Neil Gaiman, is by far one of the absolute most fasinating,intri, and exceptionally weird book I have ever read.  From the first page, Neil Gaiman makes Coraline and her surrondings come to life.  Coraline is a 12-14 aged girl, and seems to be more of a tomboy, and loves to be different.  Everywhere she goes is a place to explore.  Coraline and her parents moved into the house, it was an old house.  Coraline lived in the middle flat, Mr.Bobo, the crazy old man, lived on the top, and on the bottom were Miss Spink and Miss Forcible.  The first time they met, Miss Spink told Coraline that once upon a time, in their time, she and Miss Forcible were famous actresses.  The crazy old man upstairs claims to be training a mouse circus, one that send messages to Coraline.  One day Coraline's mom shows Coraline the door (for Coralines curiousity) just to reveal red bricks.  See, a long time before, when the house was just a house, the door led somewhere, now that there are flats, the wall was simply bricked up.  Then late at night Coraline finds the key, and opens the door once more, only to reveal no bricks but a passageway to another world, the other world, where her other parents are, with button eyes, and talking animals.  Thats it, I can not let myself spoil anymore of this marvolous story for you.  So go run to your nearest bookstore or library and grab a copy, because it's Coraline not caroline.
B000002J0B|4.0|Led Zeppelin's fifth effort Houses Of The Holy was quite different from anything else they attempted before, even more diverse than their classic fourth album (Zoso/IV/Runes/Four Corners). Here you have a lot of experimentation--reggae, prog rock, and eastern music are all attempted here. Through this album, Led Zeppelin show their sense of humor as well in songs like D'yer Mak'er and The Crunge (the title of my review is from the last line of that song).<br />Also, you'll notice more of a synth-driven sound. John Paul Jones was becoming even more adept as a pianist and composer in this album and shines throughout Houses Of The Holy. And Bonzo was arguably at his finest here, proving that he was only rivaled by Keith Moon throughout his career. Oddly, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page took more of a backseat on this venture--although both put in fine performances, this album belonged to John Paul and Bonham.<br />Now, what is obvious is that, being a Led Zeppelin album, Houses Of The Holy ROCKS. The haunting No Quarter, the fun Dancing Days, the frantic Song Remains The Same, and the fine closer The Ocean are all right up there with the best of Led Zeppelin's material. I even like The Crunge, although it took a while to grow on me.<br />However, there's one thing that urks me: Why is Houses Of The Holy not on here? The title track of this album got placed on Physical Graffitti. It should've ended up here instead.<br />This is not the best Led Zeppelin album--II or Physical Graffiti firmly occupy that spot. However, this album is absolutely essential and a Zeppelin classic, the perfect followup to IV. Buy it, along with the ones I just mentioned.
B00003XACV|5.0|To me this is an example of just what a soundtrack can add to a movie. It is modern in its use of technology but still is very poignant, varied, and interesting. It is not overtly or self-indulgantly techo nor is it a cliched orchestral strings score--quite original, I think. A real piece of work. Mr. Newman is a name I'm going to be watching in movie music.
B00000DHZJ|4.0|I'm not really crazy about compiliations. Although some are definitely better than most--Rolling Stones Hot Rocks 1963-1971, The Who Ultimate Collection, and Beatles 1 are all pretty good--there's always something missing if you don't purchase the original albums.<br />And Experience Hendrix is no exception. Where are classics like Burning Of The Midnight Lamp, Like A Rolling Stone, Voodoo Chile, and Machine Gun? Hendrix's short career has a lot of hidden gems that won't be featured in a comprehensive overlook.<br />However, for a compilation intended to introduce fans to the guitar mastery of Hendrix you can't go wrong. All of the selected material is strong, and I like how they put material from First Rays Of The New Rising Sun on here. The rest of it are mostly popular radio tunes, which does not make them inferior in the least. This is Jimi we're talking about. Few guitarists could approach him in any era.<br />This will get your foot in the door. Once you become a fan, you will want to seek out Electric Ladyland and Are You Experienced? to supplant this album. You might also want to check out Jimi's live recordings as well.
B0000399WI|5.0|Why this movie never won a single Oscar, I'll never know.  It's easily the best movie of the '90s, and qualifies as one of the best ever.  This movie has a luster, a shimmering quality that has yet to dim, even after all the times I have watched it.  <br />\\"Redemption\\" is a stark look at prison life.  From the brutal discipline of the guards, and the crushing lonliness that each and every prisoner feels.  Andy (A stirring Tim Robbins) is wrongfully convicted of his wifes' and her lover's murder, and is sentenced to life in a prison at Shawshank prison.  There, he befreinds Red (Morgan Freeman at the utmost of his abilities), a black inmate who was convicted of murder back in the '20s, and is one of the few men in Shawshank who will admit he is guilty.  For the first few years, Andy is only stays quiet staying out of the reach of the prisons' homosexual gang, who have their eye on him.  After that threat passes, he comes into his own at the prison.  He revitalizes the prison library, keeps financial records for the warden, and ends up doing the taxes for all the guards in Shawshank.  Later on, he struggles to find the truth to the murder he is convicted of, in light of new evidence brought forth from a new inmate.<br />Andy's story is not the only compelling one in Shawshank.  Morgan Freeman brings a vulnerability and a maturity to his character that  gives it depth and dimension that makes it seem that Red's soul is borne before you eyes, and you know him as if he were yourself.  And the voiceovers that he gives never come off as unnecessary filler.  Instead, they serve to give even more perspective to the movies' themes of freedom lost, despair, helplessness and triumph.<br />I really wish I could say more, but that would make this review seem drawn out and repetitive, and spoil the movie.  All you need to know is the \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" is on a higher plane.  Rarely does a movie like this, a simple story with epic undertones but never loses  sight of its true essence, ever come along.  I give this movie my highest recommendation, though it definitly deserves even more.
0553277472|3.0|After stubbornly resisting this book for 25 years because of the silly pop culture that surrounds it, I finally broke down and read it last week. No coffee shop, no backpack in the student union - just me and the book in the suburbs. It was good - very good. Did it change my life? No, absolutely not. For a better search on 'what it all means' read Gregg Easterbrook's Beside Still Waters ,and for the fascination with our day to day lives, I prefer the first two Nicholson Baker novels. Nevertheless, I still highly recommend this book. The interspersion of the trip with Pirsig's study of values is quite well done. The Greek philosophy covered and subsequent personal interpretation more than makes up for some of the hippie stuff didn't age all that well. Another plus was the trip itself, which is much better than just about any road book before or since. <br /> While my good - but not life altering -review certainly heaps more praise than the one star ones found here, it appears such middle ground is a minority position in these parts. Still, I'll stick with 3.5 stars. Once I waded through the hype and cult like following, I am glad I finally read this modern classic.
B00003CXRP|5.0|When I first saw this movie in theatres I was somewhat surprised at the somewhat sobering ending, but then quickly realized this may have been the only appropriate ending to this story of one man's struggle with nature and on another level his own inner struggles which could easily be seen as a metaphor for all our lives and other psychobabble points.  (I know, blah, blah, blah.)<br />Without getting too deep into analyzing this film and ruining it for anyone who hasn't seen it (are they actually out there?) I found this movie interesting, entertaining and actually educational.  Whoa!  Did I just say educational?  Yep, I did.  If you ever wondered what it would be like to truly &quot;get away from society&quot; for awhile, then watch this film! I think this may have been fairly realistic and as reality usually goes, this film too has a sobering with a somewhat philosophical ending.  <br />This film is almost more of a documentary (although I believe it is fictional) than entertainment.  If you want a typical &quot;feel good&quot; Hollywood movie, this may not fit the bill.  This may be the reason why some do not care for this atypical but interesting film.  There is a lot to be learned here from Tom's portrayal of one mans trials and tribulations in order to just survive.<br />&quot;No man is an island&quot;.  Right?  Well I doubt this famous quote had anything to do with one man getting stranded on an island, rather it has to do with the fact it takes many people to accomplish most tasks, not just one person.  This is where this dvd excels.  The discs extras nearly show the viewer how the entire film was made.  How each of the films departments and the people made their contributions.  Particular attention was paid to pre-production and scouting for the perfect island backdrop.  Lots of input from the actor, director, writer and others really gives the viewer a feel for what goes on behind and before the camera starts shooting.<br />Pros:<BR>--Gives the viewer a fairly realistic feel for being stranded alone<BR>--Not your typical, predictable Hollywood film<BR>--Somewhat educational..(egads!)<BR>--Lots of behind the scenes shots, comments and movie production notes on dvd<br />Cons:<BR>--NOT your typical &quot;feel good&quot; movie experience<br />Summary:<br />Is it entertainment or education?  Well let's just say Gilligan would be lost here even with the professor.
B00000DGXN|3.0|This album is pretty much one long jam session (Take it Chick... Take it Pat...  Take it Gary...  Ok, return to the theme...)<br />I love these guys, and I enjoyed hearing them play together.  I would love to hear this group live.  But I can't listen to this CD over and over, like I do all of my other CC and PM disks.<br />What I would REALLY love is to snag a recording of Burton and Corea at Times Square on December 31, 2002 that broadcast on NPR.  That was smokin!
B00004Z459|2.0|The funny thing about Linkin Park is that they almost sound genuinely hard core after \\"One Step Closer\\" yet seem to have the melody to match with \\"Crawling.\\" If you want to guess how you will react to the album as a whole, just remember how \\"In the End\\" sounded fresh at first (or maybe it never did, in which case you're wiser than I) and increasingly sounded like pop nonsense as it was continually spun by radio. Linkin Park do try their best, but they're mostly trying their best to sell records and not make compelling music, and the sentiments and instrumentation seem increasingly ham-handed and cheesy as you keep listening. The kicker, of course, is that Mike Shinoda is an MC in a way that Fred Durst could never be, but is still nothing near true hip-hop MCs like Black Thought of The Roots, Common, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Q-Tip... need I go on? If you don't know what hip-hop really is, or believe that it [is unappealing] for whatever reason, or if you don't look for invention and complexity in your music, then you might like this one, but I gave up trying after a while. I'm still looking for a new band that can do rock right, but I haven't found it here.
B00005JL78|5.0|Based on a short story from Philip K. Dick (whose other short stories had inspired Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Imposter), Steven Spielberg brings us a dark (but not too dark) vision of an all too real future world.  In the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., there is a new police force called PreCrime which apprehends murderers before they commit the crime.  For this method, three \\"PreCogs\\" are used to predict the crime thanks to drug induced mutation combined with psychic ability.  PreCrime leader John Anderton (Tom Cruise) believes heavily in the system and is the best officer on the force, until the PreCogs predict him as a murderer.  Now, Anderton is on the run while trying to unraval a vast conspiracy that will change everything he believes in.  First off I want to say that this vision of the future is very believeable, and the visual effects are incredible as well.  Spielberg's direction is some of his best here, and next to Schindler's List this is his best directorial effort.  Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances as Anderton, and his character development is paced along well.  Great, memorable roles for Max von Sydow, Colin Farrel (who steals many of his scenes with Cruise), and Samantha Morton (who is heartbreakingly tragic as a PreCog Cruise kidnaps) are among many highpoints of Minority Report, and this is without a doubt a new sci-fi classic that will be revered for years.
B00006J3WH|4.0|I have a good number of friends who border on hate for Buffy even as they know that it is in fact a well-crafted show, but most of these friends have clamored at one time or another to watch my tape of the musical episode again. Although it is very much part of the series plot, it is immensely enjoyable on it own, so much so that my friends started wishing they could listen to the songs whenever. Although the Christophe Beck score album has been killed, this project has thankfully made it at last, and luckily some of his pieces showed up here as well. These songs are incredible, especially when you realize Joss Whedon just learned how to write songs! I could say they do wear old after a while, but then I've probably listened to the soundtrack way too many times already! Trust me, as an album it works even if you don't know what Buffy is (which is unlikely I'd imagine).
6305531374|2.0|After the fiasco that was Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers, Miramax/Dimension films decided to steer the series in a Scream like direction with this seventh (and second for Miramax/Dimension) film in the series.  Jamie Lee Curtis makes her return (the last time she was seen was Halloween 2) as Laurie who now has a son (Josh Hartnett) and is an alcoholic to boot.  When Michael comes calling we see the aggressive side of Laurie that we never got to see which is refreshing, and it is good to see her and Mike go at it, but the rest of the film is just standard modern day post-Scream teeniebopper unscary horror mixed with the stalk &amp; slash routines of the 80's.  Veteran horror director Steve Miner (who helmed the second and third installemnts in the Friday the 13th series as well as House) gives Michael the most character he's had in years, but what is with Mike's mask?  I mean we can see his eyes as clear as day, when did that happen last?  The rest of the semi-well known cast includes Alan Arkin, Michelle Williams, LL Cool J, and Curtis' real life mom Janet Leigh in a cameo.  All in all, Halloween H2O is lackluster at best, but it is a much better entry than Halloween 6 and Resurrection.
0385508417|2.0|This is no litterature.  This really feels to me as if Grisham wanted to write a scenario for a comedy but didn't want to skip on the income it would bring as a book.<br />The actions and reactions of the characters could maybe pass in the caricatural world of a movie, but in a book, they're just plain unlikely and unbelievable. You're not buying it and it interferes greatly with your enjoyment. The very plot of hiding the situation from their adult 23 year old daughter is VERY hard to swallow.<br />What's more, Grisham is not a funny author. What makes a situation funny, in a book, is the style of writing, the way it is introduced and handled. In Skipping Christmas, Grisham only describes the funny situations, like he would, once again, for a scenario. But aren't books about writing? Aren't books about style? The supposedly funny situations, plainly described, fall flat and I didn't even smile once while reading it.<br />It might make an OK comedy on the screens. But as a book, no thanks.
B00006IUL7|5.0|After scoring critical praise the world over with Memento, director Christopher Nolan was tapped to direct this remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.  Nolan suceeds where most other directors would have failed thanks to the brilliant cinematography and production design, giving the Alaskan setting and the overall film an atmospheric feel that sets Insomnia apart from other modern day thrillers.  Al Pacino is good as Detective Will Dormer who is after a killer (Robin Williams who is surprisingly effective in his role) and the two are great together in their game of cat &amp; mouse.  Hilary Swank however I felt was not effective at all until the climax of the film and for the most part was wasted in her role.  While the original Insomnia (which can be found as a Criterion Collection DVD) I find superior to this remake, this film is fantastic on it's own.  All in all, this was one of the best thrillers of 2002, and further cements Christopher Nolan as a visionary director.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is one great frickin cd.  Every cd the Pumpkins ever put out was a masterpiece in itself, but this one and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness right after are the two best.  A lot of my friends don't really like these songs because the singles like &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; are too happy.  He uses the word honey in Cherub Rock and in Today he sings &quot;Today is the greatest day I've ever known&quot;.  Well I just have to say each song has a dark undertone to it, making you have to dig in to each one.  That's what I liked about all the Pumpkin's songs.  In Today you have to listen to ALL of the lyrics because one line is &quot;I wanted more than life could ever grant me&quot;.  That's not very happy.  Oh well, the millions of fans out there know all this, and everyone should own this cd!
B00004XQ83|5.0|I'd have given it more stars, but 5 were all that were available.<br />Being raised with Bluegrass, this CD took me back to my childhood.  It is wonderful to see these true musicians finally getting the respect and recognition they deserve.<br />This CD is a must for any music connoisseur.  Even if you don't care for bluegrass, the music is so much a part of our national history that any collection would be incomplete without some sampling of it.  This CD is perfect for that.
B000001EG6|5.0|There's something about this one that I continue to love to this day. It's got chamber music, it's got soul, it's got drama, it's got poetry (some of it a little dated), but it's one of his and Bernie's best works. But it was nothing what people expected when they saw him live in America on his first tour (11-17-70 captures some of it, but not completely). Most of the songs were performed on the &quot;Live in Australia&quot; CD, but this is the original.
B00005JL78|5.0|The movie itself is a feast for the eyes, with many futuristic and imaginative things thrown in by Spielberg, my favorite being the spiders.  Despite several plot holes, the movie gave me a sense that this could actually happen.  <BR>   The DVD itself is great, the extra features are interesting and enjoyable and I would recommend this to anyone who'd like a glimpse of the future, from the mind of Spielberg of course.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I hear this CD 25 years later and the music holds up well. One of the best albums in the 20th century. Even though it's short (buy VHII, Woman and Children First, and Fair Warning if you want more) and hear what the big deal was back then. 1984 took them to newer heights, but pales in comparison to the young raunchy talented band they once were.
B00003CXXM|3.0|The first time I watched this movie I really didn't like it, based mainly on the ending.  Watching it again, though, I found it is an enjoyable flick with nifty action and a decent job by Matt Damon in staying in character.  Some parts seemed a little slow and drawn out between him and Franka Potente, but it didn't take away too much from the film. <BR>   The DVD itself has good features for anyone looking for a little extra.  Overall it was a good film to sit down to and not concentrate too hard on, though it makes you feel that it is more complicated than it really is.
B000001DTM|5.0|Even though Joshua Tree is their most successful, award winning album, this one is probably their most darkest and cohesive. <br />It's chaos and electronic, but it's capturing a time when the Berlin Wall came down and they were there after the fact, recording this. You would have thought Wim Wenders was producing this album in some parts...  It almost broke the band up, and some of the early sessions were stolen (&quot;Salome&quot;). <br />They had a new anthem as a result (&quot;One&quot;), which replaced &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;40&quot; in their shows. They wound up having a huge tour as a result, culminating in &quot;Zooropa&quot; and &quot;Pop&quot; to an extent, before taking it back home. <BR>Even though you have the hits &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing&quot;, and &quot;One&quot;, the entire thing stands on its own as being one of the best records of the 90s, as well as their career. Listening to it in its entirety can be an unnerving emotional experience though.
B00006BTCA|3.0|interpol have one brilliant, amazing, head-and-butt shaking song:  \\"PDA.\\"  otherwise, they remind one of a too little known but often transcendental English band by the name of Kitchens of Distinction.  if you've a jones for driving, super melodic, anglophilic bands with awesome basslines and very passionate lyrics and soaring melodies, try the black watch's \\"jiggery-pokery\\" or \\"lime green girl.\\"  interpol are overrated.
B000063S6Z|1.0|This is my second or third attempt to like Moby. It's difficult to remember how many of his albums I've bought because they all sound alike only with different music. I won't buy another, I think two or three attempts to get it is enough. I guess the most disappointing thing about his albums is that there is always one tune on each that is real good. It is the one that gets airplay/exposure and which causes one to purchase the l.p. I can't describe the music but I'll try: Easy listening electronic pop music. Often the sound is effeminate, ummm, I mean ephemeral, usually though it is just boring. I think this album consists of sampled faux gospel music overlayed with electronic filigree but I can't be certain as my mind begins to wander after the first couple of tracks. I'm guessing that the title pertains to the number of tracks on the album but I can't be bothered to find out. Don't buy this album unless you enjoy, and I mean actually enjoy, drinking coca cola/pepsi/mountain dew, eating fritos brand anything, and dining out at Taco Bell, McDonalds, Burger King, and/or Jack In The Box. Actually, his previous album, 'Play' is much more listenable and the one I'd buy if I had to buy a Moby album to give to someone has to have something by Moby.  So, if you must, buy Play.
6305399212|5.0|This was a fantastic film. Lt. Ripley is the only survivor of the spaceship Nostromo after it's fatal incounter with Aliens. She has been adrift in space for 57 years. Not a soul believes her far fetched story of the Aliens and her flight status is revolked, that is until the alien planet that has since been colonized, can no longer be reached. A very reluctant Ripley is sent with a band of gung-ho space marines to investigate. <br />This film is fast paced and action packed, but doesn't leave much for the veiwer to guess at. Instead of one Alien the writers have opted for many aliens, probably in hopes of making up for what the film now lacks in suspense. As with the first film, the special effects are excellent. As is the acting of the lead character Ripley (Weaver).<br />Overall this was a spectacullar film, and one of the best sequals I have ever seen. The characters stayed true to the form laid out in the first film and the writers changed just enough to make this a different flick altogether. Not a dissapointment in the least.
B000001FDQ|3.0|Yngwie set the mold for many of the progressive rock guitarists to come in the following years. This is the best example of his work. Even so, the people that came after him have topped him in every way imaginable. He may be fast, but his playing is very formulaic and lacks personality or style. Guitarists like Joe Satriani, John Petrucci, and Steve Vai (among many others) have done things far more impressive then Malmsteen could have dreamed of. Still, if you're looking for some of the most influential guitar work, check this album out, mainly for the solos on Far Beyond The Sun and Black Star.
B00004TJJZ|5.0|This was a great movie.  The pairing of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith showed unbelievable ability on the part of the casting directors as the two work very well together.  This movie also shows that a great effort was made in the costume department.<br />There is comedy around every turn that L (Jones) and K (Smith) make as they chase aliens and earase memories.  Be prepared for a laugh as you will not be dissapointed.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I really like this group. I wasn't too sure how Cornell's vocals would mix with Rage style riffs, but the combination works extremely well. The songs are all pretty good, especially the single Cochise and the brutal Set It Off. In an age when many bands are trying to capture the feeling of early nineties grunge(eg Nickelback, Staind, Default), its nice to see Cornell return to show the new guys how its done. I can't wait to see what this band does in the future. The potential is there to make a truly classic album. If the band sticks together for awhile, I guarantee that they will.
6304233639|5.0|Alien invaders suddenly descend upon Earth across the world.  A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and he manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides.  Wonder and excitment at the arrival of the aliens quickly turns to terror, as is becomes clear that the nature of their arrival is not friendly.  Naturally, mankind is victorious on July 4th giving Independence Day a new meaning.  Much to the dismay of British viewers from what I have heard. <br />This is a fast paced film, with a cast that is not only well kow but also talented and they work wonders together.  The special effects spectacular.
B00005NWM3|3.0|Nickelback is a fairly good band. They aren't very original band, as they are clearly trying to imitate the grunge music of the previous decade. If you want to see how real grunge is done, check out the new stuff from Jerry Cantrell. Otherwise, this is a pretty good example of radio friendly rock that captures the feel of bands like Pearl Jam or Soundgarden. The real standouts here are the single Too Bad and How You Remind Me. In fact, there aren't any other songs on the album that I listen to very much. The band has potential, as clearly displayed on the previously mentioned tracks, but they have yet to fully realize it.
0441172717|5.0|The greatest book I have ever read. Where to start? <br />Frank Herbert, the author, is as forward thinking with this masterpiece as any work I have ever seen. There is something here for every scifi/fantasy lover.<BR>It begins with the typical noble house situation. The young Paul Atreides is the prince of a noble house that is about to assume control over a world of great wealth amidst the typical feuds and objections of other noble houses, namely the Harkonnen.<BR> <BR>This is where cliché fantasy gets derailed and nuked.<BR>The world, Arrakis, is the only world in the empire that can grow a mysterious spice called Melange. The Melange is said to have many qualities such as granting longer life (kind of like a modern day low calorie/cholesterol diet, but nothing supernatural). It does however grant an ability to see slightly into the future and for some far into the future ( a la Star Wars). This ability is crucial for interstellar navigation to foresee disaster while traveling at great speeds. Why don't they just use computers you ask?  There is a really chilling and mysterious reference about a war that took place 10,000 years ago when man made machines that could think. The machines fought back and humanity barely survived (a la Terminator). After that it was law that no one person could make a machine for a task that a human could do. People then began inventing incredible abilities such as the Navigators (the only ones who can fly spaceships because they can see into the future) the Bene Gesserits (predecessor of the Jedi who can manipulate people, move supernaturally fast, mind control with voice command, and see into the future) and the Mentat (a human computer trained to calculate the outcome of any situation where logic can be applied).<br />It just so happens that the young prince of the Atreides house is an extremely talented prodigy who is a Mentat, Bene Gesserit, and fighter. Utilizing his immense powers of body and mind he will combat the evil house Harkonnen. I don't want to give anything away so I will just say that what ensues is NOT another lesson in morality like most fantasy. It is a fantastic adventure exploring an exciting alien world with very deep and complex characters, plot twists, and philosophic questions that will leave you wondering how on earth so much substance got crammed into one novel.<BR>Summary: Get this book. If it doesn't change your outlook on fantasy and on how good books should be written I will be shocked.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Now Two Towers is by far my favorite movie!  Wow!<br />I was afraid the makers of Lord of the Rings would let the movie kind of deteriorate after number one.  Boy was I wrong.  The movie kept everything up beautifully.  They continued introducing awesome new characters  and creatures; they continued journeying and seeing awesome new scenery and special effects; they continued coming up against emotional conflicts of will; and not only did they continue fighting; they went all out; this must be about half fighting-Haleluia-the last battle scene probably has like fifteen thousand men; and the special effects are just plain wild.<br />Okay now the bad part now: many people will probably say this movie is no good because it is just too much fun for it to be right for one man to enjoy.  They will make excuses like: There are too many Battles, too many characters, and too much scenery.  What did they expect in a Fantasy?  What they are really trying to say is: Too much fun!

067942850X|4.0|an intriguing account of someone in search of adventure, freedom and perhaps himself - who ultimately completely loses it all.<br />I often wonder about those who set off for the furthest reaches of nature. Along the way surely they experience some amazing highs; but then when does thanatos override lust for life?<br />What I enjoyed most about this book was the exploration of that territory in between 'zest for total life exploration' and then apparent drive toward the beyond, through death's curtains.<br />an interesting story.
0689835604|4.0|I bought this book for my 16 months boy.  The purpose is to teach him the basic body parts which he already knew but he only touches his own and not on books.  He has finally pointed the mouth and eyes of the baby in the book and not himself, purpose fulfilled.  I think it's a good book and recommended but there's only one flaw, the flap is a bit difficult to lift by a 16 months.  My son has no problem maneouvring around small objects, he can even pick up a small bead on the ground but after a few tries, he has sort of giving up lifting the flap, when i ask him where's baby's mouth, he rather flip the page and point on the mouth on another page!
6300182282|5.0|&quot;Same time,next year&quot; is a very good movie with outstanding performances and a solid script. It tells about the story of an adultereous couple, George &amp; Doris,who have a reunion every year at the same day and the same place, a lovely hotel in California,and everytime we discover a new part of their characters and their own lives. The picture has been represented by six meetings over 26 years. The first one shows us their first meeting in 1951:they both hit by passion at first sight; the second portrayed is in 1956: while they're celebrateing their 5th anniversary they must face their first quarrel;then we move into 1961 when George helps Doris to give birth to her baby;in 1966 Doris has changed her life-style attending the university and becoming an hippie woman while George is getting more and more serious...;in 1972 things change again with Doris as an incredible business woman and finally in 1977 the couple must face for the very first time the meaning of being in love with each other.Among the several meetings there are touching clips representing the symbols of those years.Alan Alda is excellent but Ellen Burstyn takes the cake with a stunning performance.This is a picture who deals topics like regret, love, passion and nostalgia of lost time with sensitivity and good taste.Nominated for 4 Academy Awards:Actress(Burstyn),Adapted script,Cinematography and Original song.
6305428298|5.0|I am lover of British films, and this is one of my favorites.  Jane Horrocks blew me away with her amazing talent, otherwise Brenda Blethen would have stolen the show.  However, every character in this film is compelling.  The story is a little sad, but very funny in a subdued way. The ending is quite uplifting.  Not a movie for kids, due to Blethen's character's antics (wherein much of the humor lies), but very much a movie adults can enjoy, and savor over and over again.  I know I do!
B00005JKZT|5.0|After 'The Fellowship of the Ring' blazed across cinema screens in all its glory, it was really hard to imagine any film topping it off. Well, those who had read the book knew that what was to come would wipe the first film off the slate. Now, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is here, and it has done the impossible - it IS better!<BR>The film seamlessly runs straight from the first to the second, where we get an even better glimpse at what happened to Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) on the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. The story then continues. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are in pursuit of the hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monohan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have been kidnapped by a band of Suruman's (Christopher Lee) orcs. But the hobbits escape, and hide in Fangorn Forest, where they are rescued by a walking, talking tree called Treebeard. The Three Hunters also go into the forest, where they meet someone they don't expect. Soon, these four are off to Edoras, the capital of Rohan, which is under siege from Saruman. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijiah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue towards Mordor. However, they are being followed by Gollum still, and the hobbits capture the snivelling creature and force him to lead them to Mordor. <BR>Once again, Peter Jackson has outdone all expectations. The internal, psychological elements that were so irresistable in the first are back better than ever. Gollum is the most well-portrayed character, giving the creature much more psychological depth than expected. And, as usual, the jaw-dropping special effects continue. The last ten minutes of 'The Two Towers' is the most amazing, breathtaking ten minutes of cinema ever created. It literally leaves you gasping for air.<BR>When it comes to great movies, this film is there. When it comes to brilliant movies, this one is there. Even when it comes to the exclusive catagory of masterpiece, this film, along with its predesessor, is there. There is no doubt that 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is the best film of the year. But the best thing is that, watching it, you know that what is coming up in twelve months time, the third and final instalement, 'The Return of the King' will be even better than this. After all, the only thing better than a Lord of the Rings film is another Lord of the Rings film.

B00007L4MJ|3.0|I saw the print this DVD is based on a few months ago at the Uptown Theatre in Minneapolis. Kino has done more than anyone before to restore this great film. However, there ARE problems. The original score, for instance, was not always in synch with the action on the screen. That is due, no doubt, to the fact that the film is still missing much of it's footage. Therefore, the placement of the soundtrack must have been guesswork. And, frankly, the music itself is a weak and dated element. Kino should have commisioned the Alloy Orchestra to provide their outstanding version as an alternate. ...
B000069AUI|5.0|I always listen to this album over and over. I never get sick of it...ever! This is a must have for people with good music taste. Coldplay is wonderful, beautiful, unique music. I just went to Coldplay's concert a few days ago and it was by far the best concert i've ever been to. They were amazing! Buy this...its for your own good!!

B00005JKDR|1.0|For a start, the one-eyed monster is a rip-off of the space monster<BR>in the Simpsons. Same goes for some other monster elements and the<BR>breaking-voiced maintenance worker boy character. One big <BR>difference with the Simpsons however is that the Simpsons is funny<BR>and this was pathetically unfunny. From the rip-off starting <BR>premise, the concept then becomes tediously convoluted - in other <BR>words, a 95-minute mess (not that I was able to endure the entire<BR>95 minutes). Once again, Disney tries to appeal to all age groups<BR>but fails to appeal to any age group as a lot of material is too<BR>scarey for small children and too trite for grown-ups. I lasted<BR>for about 20 minutes and then I hit the 2X speed on the DVD and<BR>then 4X speed to spool through about another half hour, and then<BR>finally the STOP button followed by the EJECT button.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I loved every song on here.  &quot;I wish I cared&quot; and &quot;Velvet&quot; are some highlights.  It's great to hear them move away from the synth sound.  It is also great to hear them more lively than they were on &quot;Memorial Beach&quot;.  All a-ha is great, but this one is the best
B00005JKZT|3.0|The first movie was great but this one was boring. Nothing at all happened during the neverending 3 hours. Maybe it was supposed to lack action...hopefully the last one would be better.
0066214122|5.0|My review title says it all -- I could hardly put it down.  Rarely do I read a book that so intrigues me, so captures my imagination that my life is literally put on hold until I've finished it.  That is exactly what happened with Prey.  I knew nothing about nanotechnology going in, and although I still doubt the feasbility of many of Crichton's assertions in the story, I was fascinated nevertheless.
B00006G8LB|5.0|IT'S A MOVIE TO REMEMBER!IT HAS ALL THE THINGS:ACTION,SPECIAL EFFECTS,COMEDY AND LOADS OF STARS FROM ME!
B0000797IO|1.0|i was just like Jennifer in the movie while watching this badly written \\"comedy\\". Bored, angry, frustrated and unsatisfied. what the!? how did this movie get all the buzz? I did came up with a conspiracy theory for it but i will not get into that here. Although you got to love how Jennifer do her little walk in this one, that alone cannot hold up the entire movie. The script was a disaster, it was flat out hmm...flat...well, dont believe the critics and certainly dont believe me neither, go watch it and see for yourself. Don't buy it just yet, go rent it first.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Yes! Yes! Yes!  Chris Cornell once againg proves to the musical world that,no, he is not and never will be dead. Many of us Soundgarden fans held out little hope for the band and their future. Well, It's about time (again) that Chris Cornell gets his well deserved attention. A plethora of talent, I always thought he deserved WAY more credit than he got, and this album may very well be the key to getting him just that. Incredibly catchy songs, combined with the heart, soul and passion that comes with Chris Cornell. Take that, combine it with the outright intensisty of the ex-Rage Against The Machine crew, and, well, you get Audioslave. They come from two different musical worlds, but the fusion couldn't be more incredible. Like most people, I didn't know what to expect of the \\"fusion\\", but I was blown away, as everyone should be. Hopefully, this corroboration between Chris Cornell and ex-Rage members opens fans of both Soundgarden and Rage up to the older exploits of both these bands, cuz it did for me. I am a mega-Soundgarden fan, and even though I am familiar with RATM, I only dug a couple of their songs...UNTIL...I got the Audioslave CD, liked the musical talents shown on this record, and decided to give RATM a chance. I can Honestly say I missed alot of great music from a great band. Hopefully this has the same effect on RATM fans who might not be as familiar with Soundgarden (Alot of the younger teens I know like RATM but have no clue about Soundgarden,). I hope the new Audioslave CD opens their young musical ears to the almighty musical power that is Soundgarden!! Wether you're a mega-metalhead (like me), a \\"nu-metal\\" fan, or whatever your hard rockin' taste delights you with, get the Audioslave CD.  You'd be a complete fool to miss a musical masterpiece like this! Considering all the garbage erupting on the new rock scene, this CD should shine especially bright! BUY BUY BUY
B00005JM09|5.0|Who said T3 was a sequel to T2?  T3 is a prequel showing us what happened before Terminator and Judgement Day.  We will see John Connor in action as a man, the whole reason Terminator and Judgement Day happen.  Plus....this is a science fiction film..how was John Connor born if his father was someone from the future?  Fans need to give a little to get a lot!! Arnold's still huge and with the special effects this should be as good as the Matrix sequels
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This film was so unbelievably annoying, I only made it half way through it before I had to restrain myself from smashing the television...followed by lots of aspirin. If this is the &quot;Musical For The New Millenium&quot;, forget it! I'd rather watch &quot;Singing In The Rain&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (how DARE Nicole Kidman sing that song!), &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, &quot;Top Hat&quot;, &quot;On The Town&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, etc..etc...I would only recommend enduring this film if you're having company you don't really like and you want to get rid of them early, just pop it in. A visual feast that will leave you not only hungry, but wretching. HATED it!
0790734850|2.0|Having never seen this film at the time of its release, I was very eager to view the DVD based on the rave reviews and spectacular cast.  As the plot unwound, I became particularly disappointed in the lack of depth of the characters, the trite dialogue, and the predictability of the story (Guess what, there's a shoot-out at the end).  The only element of the film worthy of praise was the performance by Guy Pierce (his character predictably torn between a squeaky-clean image and the corruption and violence around him).  The dismal script can summarized in the deadpan voice from another lackluster Kim Bassinger performance, \\"Some guys get the world, and others get the ex-hooker and a trip to Arizona.\\"
B0000640VO|5.0|Cute story, visually riveting. The actors all put so much into their perfomances and it captivates you.
0375751513|4.0|that would be the ideal way to describe Dorian Gray - an impressionable young Adonis on his Hedonistic quest for a life which itself is a work of art. Society artist Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian Gray which ages and hardens as Gray's quest lead him to a remorseless and brutal lifestyle is the mirror to his soul while his physical form remains as youthful as ever. The book builds up beautifully towards the climax. Wilde's generates idle irreverent amoral and bitingly sarcastic dialogue as if out of thin air.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyds Greastest Hits ever on two cds. A must by for any pink floyd fan or for any rock fan at that matter. Songs like &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Comfortly Numb&quot; gave me chills when i heard them. Its pink floyd at his best
B00003CXI0|4.0|This is a great movie.Daniel Radcliffe stars as Harry Potter and puts a spell on everyone in the world!The second movie is released and I'm waiting for the third one.Too bad they are not  goin' to make the fourth one!
B0000669JL|5.0|If someone were just starting to build a CD collection or asking me which disc they should get that they don't have, this is the first one that would spring to mind.  It seems that EVERYONE, whether they're into hip-hop or rock or country can dig Bob Marley.  How many other artists can you say that about?  That said, this CD is just about the most versatile disc conceivable.  Feeling a little low - just play &quot;Three Little Birds&quot; or &quot;Is This Love?&quot;  Need some music to get your party started?  &quot;Jamming&quot; and &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot; will do the trick.  Looking to chill out with your significant other?  &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot; (just about the most beautiful song ever conceived) or &quot;Stir It Up&quot; will set the mood.  It wouldn't surprise me if they did a study that showed that people that listen to this CD were miraculously cured of their illnesses!! It's that powerful!!  This is the CD that I think one day will pass the Eagles' Greatest Hits as the biggest selling CD in history, since there is nothing that can slow this down.

B0000797IO|5.0|the good girl is a portrait of modern day filmmaking at it's very best. of course it's weird and depressing take on justines life could use some comedy. other than being dark i thought it was an masterpiece.
0316666343|4.0|The story is full of charm and intrigue.  It is artfully told. A haunting and inspiring experience.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I have read many reviews of this movie.  For the most part, people seem to be most impressed with the fact that movie remained faithful to the book.  I agree, that impressed me as well.  But what really impressed me about this film are the excellent performances of the younger members of the cast.  Yes, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, and Alan Rickman were superb during their limited screen time.  But that was expected.  Radcliffe was perfect for the role.  His low-key acting is refreshing to watch compared to the epidemic of overacting we see in contemporary young actors.  He conveyed so much with his eyes, facial expressions, and body language.  Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were also excellent in their roles, although Emma Watson did have a tendency to overact at times.  But then again, the character of Hermione is a bit intense to begin with.
B000088E6M|3.0|This album was good...but not that good.  Maybe my expectations for a hip hop album are too high....but, it was entertaining none-the-less.  50 Cent's \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\" album is a far improvement over anything done by phony rap cats like Ja Rule.  I wouldn't say that this is a lousy album, but it's far from being a perfect hip hop album in my eyes.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira is often called the latin Alanis, and I can see how that could be. However they are two different people with two different styles of music.<BR>Shakira got my attention when I saw the music video for Whenever, Wherever and I haven't lost it since. I bought this album when it came out and I sill listen to it, the songs are wonderful and I still love Whenever, Wherever.<BR>The english tracks are great as are the spanish tracks, and I don't know how to speak spanish but I feel something when I listen to them, I feel good!<BR>One of the best songs on this would be Eyes Like Yours, something that when friends hear they love right away too.
B000002MJR|4.0|Although all of the songs here are relatively recent (in DS terms), that doesnt mean that the album should be dismissed out of hand. <br />True some of the songs don't come off as well as they did from the other live album (Alchemy) DS produced, there is some quite startling (and emotive) musicianship here, with the set being started off with traditional high energy rockouts such as Calling Elvis (with some extra solo's by Knopf), a lively version of Walk of Life, and an extended version of Heavy Fuel.<br />The rest of the songs bobble along fine, and are are perfectly listenable to, with the highlights being a turbo-charged rendition of Money for Nothing, and probably the finest moment of Knopf's career that is this live version of Brothers in Arms; It's fantastic. A jot longer than the studio versions (even the original), it is fantastic from the start where the opening guitar licks are precisely phrased, through to a thunderous (dual) guitar solo ending, with Knopf and Paul Franklin providing expert handling of the song's guitar track; the latter quite unexpectedly, the former being exactly as anticipated. Thoroughly enjoyable
B000002WYT|5.0|This album is far more mature then Under The Table and Dreaming, it's also more artistic, fun, musically better, lyrically better, and over all better produced. And I LOVE Under The Table... but this album just shines!<br />So Much To Say to Proudest Monkey, I can listen to all the tracks (baring Lover Lay Down) and I never get sick of it. this album undoubtly contains some of Dave Matthews Band's greatest works, #41 for example and also the hit song Crash Into Me.<br />The highlights of this album include Two Step, Cry Freedom, and Tripping Billies among others.<br />This album is a must have.
B000002UB3|5.0|In 2003, there is nothing left to say about the meaning and grandiloquence of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, the last register recorded by The Beatles. What I can do is talk about the sensations caused by this album.<br />&quot;Come Together&quot; opens the A side in a great style, one of the best Lennon's works. &quot;Something&quot;, the next song, is the best George Harrison's work, and was described by Frank Sinatra as one of the greatest love songs of music history. &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; has black humour lyrics and a weird melody, followed by one of the few compositions of Ringo Starr, &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; - an ode to a misanthropic lifestyle. &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; leads the listener to heaven (or hell), with its monotone lyrics and dark instrumental.<br />&quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; is another good composition of Harrison, anticipating the style of his first solo album, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. &quot;Because&quot; introduces the first suite of the album, followed by &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;, &quot;Sun King&quot;, &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;, &quot;Polythene Pam&quot; and the enigmatic &quot;She Came In Through The Bathroom Window&quot;. After this song, you'll be in a trance, ready for the second suite of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; - and maybe the best all-time sequence of songs in rock and roll history. It begins with &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;, passes by &quot;Carry That Weight&quot; (backing to the theme of &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;) and finishes with the apotheotic &quot;The End&quot; - which brings the greatest and last message of the Fab-Four: &quot;In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make&quot;. The last track, &quot;Her Majesty&quot;, is a simple and funny song written by Paul to one of his daughters.<br />&quot;Abbey Road&quot; is the definitive Beatles' work, an authentic masterpiece and my #1 desert island album. Should gain 5 million stars.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Okay I bought this album and I seriously cannot get it out of my CD player, it's amazing! I have been listening to it non-stop since I got it.<br />Come Away With Me is a serious jazz/folk/soul album that is just brilliant!<br />I don't think there is one bad song on it... I have only one complaint, I wish it was longer then it is.
B000000WA4|5.0|This record is more art than it is rock. It hits two amazing extremes that I have never heard before. With songs like &quot;Galapagos&quot; and &quot;Stumbleine&quot; and &quot;1979&quot;, the Pumpkins hit a softer, more floating extreme. Then, with songs like &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; and &quot;Tales of a Scorched Earth&quot; they add their harder element and go into a more extreme grunge music. Both albums have a feeling that you can't describe but you can feel, you can tell that this is Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, it's one of the songs that make up one of the greatest albums ever. Billy Corgan is an artist like no other. Good luck with Zwan, RIP Smashing Pumpkins. This record will help you more appriciate the world around you, so buy it.
B00005RFAI|4.0|When I got this album I was in love with it and after a year I find that there are songs on here that I would consider some of my most favorite songs ever.<BR>This album does have it's bad spots, Family Portrate (horrible single choice) being one of them. But I feel that the great songs stand out more then those. 18 Wheeler is by far the best track on this album, it's a powerful angry song that just makes you wanna be stronger, Numb is also good, Just Like A Pill, Get The Party Started, Don't Let Me Get Me, and the tital track are all brilliant songs. I reccomend it.
B000002UAX|5.0|This record exploits the strengths of the Beatles like no other record they released. It shows their progression in sophistication and music, stating once and for all that they are, without contest, the greatest band of all time. There has and never  been and never will be another White Album. See for yourself to fully experience the world around you.
B000060P79|1.0|Simple Plan is not Blink 182. They are way too Pop to be called Blink. None of their tracks hard enough to please true punk rock fans. All of Simple Plans tracks kinda sound the same but that isn't always a bad thing. I think this album would apeal more to teenage girls who watch MTV all day than 18 guys who are looking for harder beats. It is a good album at first but the POP soon takes over and it makes me put away the CD for good.
B00006LETU|5.0|If Donald Fagen wasn't a composer or a musician, he very well could have had another career as this generations T.S. Eliot or another Steinbeck or even Hemingway.  You may think I'm insane for suggesting this but if you look through Mr. Fagens' entire career of songwriting you will understand what I mean.  His lyrics tell stories of people, places, love, hate, prejudices, etc.  His use of language is unlike any other songwriter in musical history.  I know when I purchase any work from Donald Fagen it will be of the highest order.  I'm in my early 40's now but I'd like to thank you Mr. Fagen for years of entertaining and thought-provoking music.

B00002E23E|5.0|I would just like to say, even though I wasn't around when Led Zeppelin were the gods of Classic Rock, I absolutely love their music and I think that every fan should have this video if they are a truly into Led Zeppelin.

0780619609|4.0|The turtles 2nd movie, Secret of the Ooze is a good followup to the classic original but there are some changes for this movie, the turtles voices are different, same with April O' Neil, (even though she is prettier in this movie, but she isn't nearly as feisty in this one) and Donatello's character is different than the original, in the original he was a wisecracker, but in this one, he's more sensitive and less funny.<BR>Oh and one other thing, there is no Casey Jones in this one.<BR>All in all, if you're a turtles movie fan, then I would recommend this movie for you, it's not as good as the original, but it's alot better than the third movie and the Power Rangers.

B00006RU5B|5.0|I'm the result of 70's, 80's and 90's ROCK. NOT Hip Hop. NOT a Hybrid of Hip Hop & Rock...<br />Simply, This album really ROCKS. Anyone who appreciates quality hard rock / heavy metal guitar and vocals will LOVE this album... it's been awhile. Wes Borland (Limp Bizkit) is really good... The guys from SlipKnot are impressive. Tom Morello is awesome. As it says in the liner notes, all sounds on this CD are produced by GUITAR!<br />Vocals are STELLAR. Chris Cornell is arguably the best vocalist in Rock today (I personally think one of the best EVER). Check this CD out...
B000060P79|3.0|I don't know why I got this cd but I did, and it grew on me.  It's nothing like real punk yet all the mtv kids think it is.  It's catchy but it sounds like all the other bands that mtv plays and calls punk.  Besides the lead singer's voices if you put all the bands on a cd and gave them to someone, they wouldn't be able to tell them apart.  But still God Must Hate Me, I'd Do Anything, When I'm With You and Perfect are some really good songs, even if the lyrics are a bit simple.  Buy this if you need a new Good Charlotte clone.
B000000OAA|5.0|There's no question about it.  This is Queen's best album!  The album starts out with \\"Brighton Rock\\" which has like a 2 minute guitar solo, and is just simply fantastic!  Next is \\"Killer Queen.\\"  This song is a classic Queen song.  I LOVE IT! \\"Tenement Funster\\" comes up next, which has the drumer, Roger Taylor, on lead vocals.  This song is a hard rocker with a nice acoustic guitar rhythem.  \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" is one of my favorite songs on this album.  Just listen to Brian May's guitar work and you'll be hooked to this song.  Once \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" has ended, it goes right into \\"Lily of the Valley\\" which is a very short song, but very emotional and worth listening to.  Next is \\"Now I'm Here\\" that has a nice rocky guitar rhythem and is a great song to be performed live.  Then \\"In the Lap of the Gods\\" is next.  This song also features some good guitar work and has opera-like rhythem, which brings out the song completely.  The next song is \\"Stone Cold Crazy.\\"  This is personally my favorite song Queen has ever done.  It's also a pre-heavy metal song and probably one of Queen's heaviest rocker ever.  FANTASTIC!  \\"Dear Friends\\" comes up next, which is a lullaby written by Brian May and has nice vocals from Freddie.  This song is only 1 minute long, but it's still worth listening to.  Then it's \\"Misfire\\" where almost all of the guitar work is done by John Deacon, the bass player.  This song has an island, tropical type tone that makes the song interesting.  Next Queen does \\"Bring Back that Leroy Brown\\" which is a rag-time song that's also very interesting, unfortunately I think it's the worst song on the album, but it's still a pretty good song.  \\"She Makes Me\\" comes up with Brian May on lead vocals.  At the end of the song you can hear outer space sound effects in the background, which makes the song cooler than it really is.  The last song is \\"In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited.\\"  This song is pretty dramatic and builds up towards the ending.  It's just great.  In conclusion, well, there's nothing to say, except, BUY SHEER HEART ATTACK!  IT'S PURELY QUEEN'S NUMBER 1 ALBUM!n conclusion, well, there's nothing to say, except, BUY SHEER HEART ATTACK!

0446310786|5.0|I first read To Kill a Mockingbird for a school assignment. When I was finished I sighed in depression because I'd just finished one of the best literary pieces I'd ever read. It takes place in a sleepy southern town during the 1930's. It is told throught the eyes of a young Scout Finch living with her older brother Jem Finch, father Atticus who is a respected lawyer, and Black House Keeper and friend Calpurnia. Also popping up every summer is the bright eyed Charlse Baker Harris also known as Dill who gets the idea to try to make the Mysterious neighbor Boo Radley come out. When a local family the Ewells accuses Tom Robinson a black man of the beating and rape of a young woman Atticus is appointed to be Tom's defense. <BR>The book opens up the simpler times of America, but also the hardships it had to go through. It kept me interested every on every word. It makes you smile and find yourself nodding with the simplicity of the childhood issues and complexity the two go through. This book is an amazing achievement in the literary world, and shows of the morality and harshness the world can behold. It is a compelling novel and a view to the way people work.
B00005YW4H|4.0|This is a great album but I agree with Loretta Meck's review that Once Blue's Once Blue is by a far a better album. Once Blue consisted of Jones' guitarist Jesse Harris and singer, Rebecca Martin. While Jones' album creates an occasional great mood, Once Blue is an album you'll listen to over and over without ever getting bored. Better songwriting and singing. The hype Jones is getting with her work with Harris should have gone to Martin. Its a shame Once Blue is no longer around or more widely known.
0553573403|5.0|This is one of those books that you can not put down.  You have no idea what is going to happen next and when you guess you are often wrong.  The plot line is not a line at all.  Just like real life characters change and things go haywire some time.  This book is really light fantasy that most readers will enjoy regardless of genre.  Martin writes a very good non stop story.
B00001U0E1|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best films ever made. The performances are outstanding, the language is beautiful, and the writing and directing could not have been more skillfully done. In essence, in all the times I have watched this film (which is many, let me assure you) I have never seen so much as a second of the film that I would change in any way. I am an avid fan of horror movies and was so pleasantly surprised by this film. It is not merely a comedy, nor merely a retelling of a Shakespearean tale, though it incorporates both comedy and Shakespearean text; it simply transcends what films are normally able to achieve for me. I really liked the fact that there are so many little things that the fan of Shakespeare can pick up on that enhances the comedy and wit, but are in no way necessary for the enjoyment of the film. This, in itself, is a testament to the talent of the writers and director, to be able to produce such a layered piece of art that works on so many levels and is entertaining, regardless of the viewer's knowledge of Shakespeare and his work. Everything seems to fit exactly where it is, which I find not to be the case with most films. The performances really steal the show, however. Fiennes plays an extraordinary Shakespeare; I can't imagine anyone else in this role. Paltrow, I believe, delivers the best performance of her career. Rush and Dench are simply amazing. I cannot say enough good things about this film. It is essential for any fan of good cinema.

0441172717|5.0|This is the science fiction novel by which all other science fiction novels are judged. I remember reading it for the first time as a sophomore in high school and I was completely blown away. The first 50 pages were pretty boring, as Frank Herbert is laying the groundwork for what's about to come. By the time I hit page 100, I couldn't put it down. I have read thousands of books, newspapers, and magazines over the last 30 years and if someone were to ask me, \\"If I only read ONE book in my lifetime, what would you recommend?\\" - DUNE would be my answer.

0385335482|4.0|sophie kinsella gets it right in this lighthearted, down-to-earth story about a shopaholic.  this isn't a book of literary substance but i don't believe the author intended it to be.  this is a true-to-life story of a woman who spends beyond her means and how she comes to grips with &quot;being up to my eyeballs in debt.&quot;  i've been there, done that and (thank god) don't do it anymore.  this was very funny and so true, you couldn't help but gobble it up.  even the predictable &quot;hook up&quot; with luke is something many of us have experienced with some happy and not so happy results.<br />read this when you need a break from the heavy, heartwrenching, thought provoking books on your reading list.<br />just great, good fun!<br />looking forward to the next 2 installments of becky bloomwood's life.
0689835604|5.0|Finally a book my child loves! She cannot seem to get enough of \\"Where is Baby's Belly Button\\" (even though I think she knows where her belly button is by now!!!) She loves to lift all the fun and funky flaps to see what's underneath and is constantly giggling with glee at all the great pictures and text!! I love my child, and my child LOVES this book. Many thank yous to Karen Katz, the authoress of this family favorite!!! Or, as the English would write: favourite! ...
B00006J3WH|4.0|One of the weirdest moments in TV history and they've finally made a soundtrack for it. This CD is fully worth the buying of it! The sound quality is amazing! Plus, you get songs that most people wouldn't think to put up on the web. My favorite of these small songs is probably the parking ticket! (HILARIOUS)A must buy for Buffy fans and for those curious about the crazy culture of Buffy.
0694526088|4.0|Love this book. Its message is fairly straightforward and makes sense. Many have said that it's perhaps too simplistic, but if it were so easy to implement these strategies, more companies would be best in class.<br />My only complaint, the author is absolutely annoying on the Audio CD. Great exaggeration, overemphasis on every topic. He sounds like a bad actor who is trying too hard. The unfortunate part is that the author is narrating the Audio CD, not someone else. He comes across a bit to self-absorbed and proud of himself, as if he discovered the Holy Grail. There is nothing wrong with being passionate about your work, but this guy needs to relax. <br />He also needs a speech coach. Since when is Nazi pronounced \\"nasi\\"? Buy the book and be forewarned that the Audio Book will have you hating this guy by the end and you'll forget his message.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Oh, come on, it was great! Made me feel like 36 again. Love the bit where the guy runs up the stairs to take on the giant fire breathing dragon with a fire extinguisher.
B00005JLS0|5.0|I am so in love with this movie!!!  I had the best time watching it!
B00005JKED|5.0|Training Day, as an entire film is great. The dvd extras make this dvd extra special. You get deleted scenes , dir. commentary, music videos , and an alternate ending. Most times the \\"alternate ending \\" , added to newer dvd's, motivate me to buy it. Although, 9 times out of 10, you get an instant idea of why it was deleted ,in the first place. However, just to have that viewing option , it's worth the investment. Anyway, the film's actors deliver phenominal performances and catipult a simple script ,into a film that not only ,studies the motivations and psychology of people dealing with the corruption and life on the streets, but entertain and shock the viewers. As you should already know, Denzel Washington took home an Academy Award after his portrayal of a corrupt undercover police officer,in this production. Ethan Hawk, also works through his role as a rookie cop , with excellent believability and intensity. Although , this film has valuable lessons to learn , I don't recommend that you view this with the little ones. It contains scenes of drug use , very foul language, and graphic violence. Despite those aspects , Training Day offers a rare glimpse into the harsh realities of crime and deseption. Definately a dvd to buy. Even if you're not into the bad cop /good cop movies, seeing Denzel play a charcter that's as evil as his best good guy roles were , in the past, makes it worth your while. Alot of people I know were shocked that he could play bad, so good. But if they'd noticed , he gave a fantastic sinister performance as the younger juvenile Malcom X , in the Spike Lee movie. Anyway.......order Training Day and buckle your seat belts.
B000001ELF|5.0|I absolutely thought KISS was one of the best things in my life when I was 9 or 10 years old. I didn't think a thing about the sexual innuendoes, the drugs, the whatevers, I just loved KISS. Now that I'm an adult, some of those sexual innuendoes are just hysterical, make you want to cringe thinking you liked it at one time, and make it an embarassment to say you liked KISS.<br />Ace Frehley in my mind was always exempt from this. By far, Ace was always my favourite member of KISS, his lead guitar playing is vastly underrated,(his leads had hooks, they were part of the song like the melody), and he didn't dive the depths of immature sexual innuendo as much as grown men such as Gene or Paul. Honestly, Gene and Paul wrote kiddie stuff, embarassing for a 35 year old to be writing honestly, and strictly derived to accomodate a certain market. Young, 16 year old boys who can't drink, smoke or get girls yet. Ace didn't write songs like that, apart from Cold Gin on the first KISS album.<br />This album stands well to time. The songs do not sound dated, the lyrics are not stupid or banal or anything indicating a 70's attitude, and it just rocks. All the way through. There is not a weak track on it, and even though criticism is there on Wiped Out from other fans, I love that song for its time changes (Anton Fig's drumming on this song is the album's standout) and it is just a great song period. Its always been one of my top 3 songs on the album. Ace just really showed how talented he was. I've never read Simmons autobiography, and I have no interest in it, but Ace always lived up to his potential even if he was chemically enhanced sometimes. Its why Ace's solo album was the best received by a wider fan base than the KISS Army, the critics and musicians alike, it was THAT good an album. It has an element of STREET about it, slightly punk in attitude. This album is actually full of attitude, and it just says New York all over it.<br />Ace had pop sensibilities as well. 'What's On Your Mind' borderlines between hard rock and pop. No, Ace is not the greatest singer, but he has that Jimi Hendrix approach where in the end you can't hear anyone else singing the songs as well but Ace Frehley.<br />It has become a cliche this album. I imagine people who don't even own it now say Frehley's album was the best when giving their mock history of KISS. The fact of the matter was, it is and still is. You can play the whole thing through and not smirk because the lyrics are hokey or childish, the guitar solos are polished and gutsy at the same time, the drummer was great, the songs and arrangements were class, the production was just near perfect but just enough punk to have credibility. If not for Frehley, the next KISS album (Dynasty) would have been horrible and so dated in sound and sentiment that they might not have survived to GET to the 80's. Some say Simmons and Stanley are KISS, including themselves, but what a shame. Ace Frehley consistently came up with songs that even KISS fans say are the best songs in the KISS repertoire, Cold Gin, Parasite, Shock Me, Rocket Ride, Hard Times. The guy just had tons of talent and should have gotten out of KISS as soon as he released this album.<br />THAT would have been a success story. Maybe Simmons is right and Frehley never lived up to his potential. Maybe its because he had Simmons telling him he never would, you just never know.<br />Do you mean to tell me that Ace Frehley all messed up on booze and drugs working at half the potential, STILL came up with a better KISS album than KISS ever achieved? Even with Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over, Hotter Than Hell, Ace Frehley's solo album was so together that no one could diss it. There's no Goin Blind's, no Great Expectations, no Love Theme From KISS, that just makes you say was this person serious when they wrote this? They are joking right??? Frehley's album you can listen to as a kid, and listen to as an adult and say, I knew I had good taste.s On Your Mind' borderlines between hard rock and pop.

B00005JKCH|5.0|This is by far the best comic book made movie since the first Batman. It is not only true to the comic, but able to present the off-the-wall reality while actually taking itself seriously. This movie is a great blend of action, drama, and comedy that is suitable for all ages. If you were a fan of Batman, X-Men, or Superman, then Spiderman is sure to please.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Chicago was first choreographed by Bob Fosse and he is obviously alive and well, though deceased, in this adaptation of his Broadway musical.<br />Chicago revolves around Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) and Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a pair of foxy murderesses who end up in the Cook County Jail.  Roxie is awaiting trial for the murder of her \\"using\\" lover and Velma is awaiting trial for putting the hit on family.  While in jail they are under the watchful eye of a matron who can produce almost anything for a price.  <br />Be ready to be neatly transported from the jail to imagined Chicago club scenes.  Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) the womanizing, sleeze ball lawyer, who was a purchase made possible  through the jail house matron, is the perfect advocate for these desperate and star struck jail birds.  Billy sells his services and the women sell their souls and the movie just sells itself.  All three do their own singing and dancing and if you LIKE musicals you will LOVE CHICAGO!  The camera work is both mind boggling and riveting.  Speed up here, stop action there and Chicago comes to riviting life.  From jail to stage the story flows reaching the heights only dreamed about by Roxie and Velma.  Reality and hope wend throughout while Roxie and Velma make hope a reality.  <br />Casting is superb.  Richard Gere is made for this role!  The ladies classy in a garish sort of way. <br />There is a trial and the courtroom scene is a tap dance fit for a lawyer.  The finale is a great recap of all that transpired.  This is a fine step back in time to when musicals were grand, glorious and available and certainly a more common fair.  The sound track fits perfectly into all the nooks and crannies of which the movie shows a plenty!  It is loud and naughty and in your face fancy.  Hope springs eternal as any vistor to Wrigley Field or Soldier Field full well knows.  This is CHICAGO!
B00000K2W1|3.0|These are all wonderful songs.  A rare treat not to have fillers on an album.   This was a hit when it was released and still is.  Being a 1970 graduate I still know each and every song and  I still have my vinyl.  I didn't give it a five star rating because I believed the sticker on the CD case that said &quot;remastered&quot;.  The sound is so bad.  I have a good sound system and some of the instruments sound terrible.  Almost painful in places.   Unfair to such an otherwise great album.  I don't think it would be that costly to make this truly &quot;remastered&quot;.
B00006JLX4|5.0|I am a little shocked that this album has been described as \\"overrated\\" by some posters. At the risk of dating myself, I suspect they are too young to remember the state of indie rock in 1991, when the catchy-but-not-very-original Superchunk and the we-release-the-same-album-full-of-songs-of-self-pity-over-and-over-again Sebadoh were the genre's flagship bands.<br />I remember how anticipated this record was in the bay area after the release of the Summer Babe single, which dominated the college radio airwaves upon release. Like many people, I went back and bought  Demolition Plot J7 and Perfect Sound Forever (their previous releases on Drag City) after Summer Babe came out, which left me very unsure as to what to expect from S&E. <br />Believe it or not, S&E was really much more original for its time than the earlier Drag City material . Lots of now -forgotten groups were doing the noise-pop thing back then. While obviously heavily influenced by the Fall and Pixies, S&E still sounded completely unlike anything else anyone had heard at the time, or anything anyone expected to hear. It changed the way people thought about pop songs, and so, for those of us who were around when it came out, it will always be a very special record. The jagged chord structures, whimsical lyrics, and the general \\"controlled chaos\\" of the excecution created an absolutely magical atmosphere on that record. The later material has always sounded far too polished to me to effectively communicate their \\"sideways\\" vision of pop, but I'm glad that there are others out there who dig it.<br />There are two items on this release that have never been available before: \\"Nothing Ever Happens\\", an S&E outtake that probably *should* have stayed in the can, and a concert from late 1992. For me, the concert is a let-down, but I must qualify that by saying that I saw them in person many times in 1991/1992, so I probably remember the shows being better than they were. The alternate studio version of \\"Here\\"(which sounds a bit like Jesus and Mary Chain to me!) was actually released as a bootleg single back in the day, as were both of the Peel sessions that are presented in legitimate format here. <br />HOWEVER, nowhere has the sound quality for any of this material been anywhere close to what it is here. If you listen on a boombox or a lo-fi system (nothing wrong with that), this is probably irrelevant to you. If you have a decent stereo, you will notice a big improvement - this release has a much fuller sound and a lot more presence, which might be a little paradoxical seeing as this is regarded as a lo-fi landmark!<br />In any event, this is an essential purchase for anyone interested in indie-pop, even if you already have most of the included material. In fact, it is a cornerstone of any collection in the genre.
0316666343|1.0|I am struggling with this novel, which is surprising, because I was really looking forward to reading it. I don't even think the writing is very good. It is often confusing and awkward. I am having a hard time relating to any of the characters, as none of them seem real to me. I am only on page 150, so there is still hope, but at this point I think I am just being stubborn to continue with it. I forced myself to finish &quot;On Green Dolphin Street&quot; in November, and swore that was the last time I would do that for a book that is meant to be &quot;pleasure reading&quot;. Some pleasure. For true pleasure reading, try Atonement. Sebold's novel seems to be an overhyped chore.
B00004Z459|3.0|i used to like Linkin Park. but only b/c they had a fresh style. But they became to overplayed and the album is not as good as it could have been. A big hype around these guys. I like a handful of songs. I'd say less than half the album is good in my opinion and to me, it has to be at least half for it to get a 3 star rating. but i'm gonna be open about this one.<br />Papercut is by far the only track that i would give a 5 star rating too. its a fantastic intro to the CD and flows very well. This is one of their best songs, aside from My December.<br />One Step Closer was the first hit and one of hteir other good songs. It was original and following Papercut like that it sounds wonderful.<br />Crawling - Another good song by them. It reaches out and pulls you in. I like this song and hte video is impressive. good song.<br />and thats about it<br />By Myself is good and so is Pushing Me Away. But thats 5 songs. the rest is trash to me. the same thing over and over again.<br />But its decent. Of all the new bands out htere that I can't stand, this one ranks up there as tolerable.<br />If you are looking for something similar to Limp Bizkit, go for this. Its very much like Limp Bizkit meets Backstreet Boys.<br />On a final note about the band itself. Chester Bennington has too much of an identity crisis. he needs to stop being a poser and start relying on his ability. he scratches his voice too much on the record and therefore loses a lot of credibility in my eyes. He's got a voice. but after seeing them in concert and how badly he stretches his voice to appease the fans, I can safely say that he is going ot lose it soon. that voice will fly out of him soon. Look at Jon davis, his voice is in bad condition. if chester keeps it up he'll do the same thing. ...
B00007GZQI|3.0|Sir Guy Grand is a pompous billionaire who, while strolling through St. James' Park, adopts a homeless young man as his own new son. With his protegee in tow, Sir Guy proceeds to tour the town; confirming his belief that everyone in London(and the world) is beholden only to the all-mighty British quid. Things really go bonkers when the pair joins the maiden voyage of a new luxury liner. The party becomes a riot. 1969's \\"The Magic Christian\\" is a zany, riotous romp released at the end of the turbulent, psychedelic 60's. Dated it is. Starring Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr(as his son), \\"The Magic Christian\\" is a pre-Monty Python extravaganza featuring some funny skits, cameo bits by celebrities, and a series of long, boring episodes with Sir Guy(Sellers) lost in total self-absorption. Among the guest stars are Laurence Harvey(in a strip-tease), John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Raquel Welch, Christopher Lee as Dracula, Roman Polanski, John Cleese and Yul Brynner in drag. The real glistening gem of \\"The Magic Christian\\" is the vibrant music by Badfinger and Thunderclap Newman. With songs written by Paul McCartney(and sung by his brother), Badfinger was once considered heir to the Beatles. Their meteoric success capitalized on British hard-rock and lilting gentle lyrics.  But after 2 band members committed suicide, they quickly disappeared.  As chronicled so expertly by Roger Lewis' \\"Life and Death of Peter Sellers\\" in 1994, the British actor/superstar was an amazing whirl of selfish, vain psychosis. Hidden behind wigs and make-up, Sellers had no real personality of his own, his psyche melting into his many odd roles with unsettling ease. Peter Sellers' temper tantrums destroyed marriages, wives, children, and fellow actors.  Just 2 years before \\"The Magic Christian\\", Sellers had quit the set of \\"Casino Royale\\" during production. The real failure of \\"Casino Royale\\" is the fact that it's hero, James Bond, completely disappears half-way through the film.  2 years later, nervous \\"Magic Christian\\" producers wanted to avoid another calamity, and allowed Sellers to tinker with the screenplay and take over direction.  In 2 sequences, Sellers acts with his back to the camera. \\"The Magic Christian\\" is a curious mish-mash of adroit British humor, shaky hand-held photography, and cut-and-paste story-telling. This new DVD is a bare-bones, but lovely full-screen transfer.  How could a big-budget comedy with the premiere performer of it's day, 2 of the Beatles(and singing by a third) go wrong?  It's well worth your time to find out why. Just once.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I first received the Shrek DVD as a gift from my step-sister. I didn't want to watch it, but she talked me into it. I ended up loving it!! It is such a super movie. I suggest buying it or renting it if you have not seen it.
0790729709|5.0|I love this movie! I've watched it over-and-over again and I can never get enough of it. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston are an incredible pair as the love-torn Frank Farmer and Rachel Marron. Although I cried my eyes out at the end, I still would highly recommend this movie to anyone. Whitney's rendition of \\"I Will Always Love You\\" far surpasses that of Dolly Parton, and it sends chills up my spine. WATCH IT!!!
B000000H5J|5.0|Hands down, this CD kicks the hell out of anything else released during the decade. While Obsolete is just as good, this CD is just a little bit better, and I would guess that I've listened to it probably 25,000 times by now . . .
B000065U1N|3.0|Very realistic battle sequences, a lot of blood and gore. But I found the movie sort of dry. There was a lot of swearing (understandably) and all of the actors gave good performances. I would recommend it to war-movie lovers, although it's not as good as some.
B0000024SI|5.0|Dylan already went electric on Bringing It All Back Home, and there was no turning back. On Highway 61 Revisited, Dylan solidified his songwriting, mixed rock and folk very well (whilst BIABH had either rock songs or folk songs), and this is Dylan's arguably most cohesive album, and one of his most influential.<BR><br />Dylan's lyrics, like always, are filled with bizarre imagery bordering on both reality and surrealism. Like on &quot;Tombstone Blues,&quot; he tells of people going through hard times then adds one of the weirdest lyrics ever (&quot;The sun isn't yellow. It's chicken.&quot;) &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; and the 11-minute &quot;Desolation Row&quot; rank as some of his best works, and despite the rather long songs, it flows and resonates, something Dylan has struggled with on past albums.
B0000648WZ|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time a little over a year ago and didn't like all the gory parts. Now I can't get enough of it! Casper van Dien is excellent (despite some of his lines being rather corny), Dana Meyer is fantastic, and all the other actors and actresses are perfect...except, that is, for Denise Richards, who gives a blah-blah performance as Johnny Rico's former girlfriend. <br />I highly recommend Starship Troopers to anyone who loves good sci-fi thrillers with lots of blood and gore. The best part about this movie (except for Casper) is the language: If you don't want to hear your hero cursing every 5 seconds then look no further! Two F-words are all, and then mild language here and there. <br />An excellent movie.
B00008DZ81|4.0|I watched this movie when it first came out. Let me tell you I was rather impressed. My son was more interested than I, when it started, but before it was over I was at the edge of my seat as well. Good family get together movie. Lots of action but not to grown up.
0066214122|2.0|I have read two reviews of this novel.  Apart from some mild criticism,  both were favorable. These reviewers have been too kind. Prey is one of the most poorly written novels I've ever read. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it offers some interesting ideas as well as some fascinating information about the burgeoning new science of nanotechnology. <br />Michael Crichton didn't try to write a readable, engaging novel here. All the characters are one-dimensional with virtually no character development, and much of the dialogue is inane--in one chapter, two of the main characters spend a half a page discussing the virtues of various disposable diapers! <br />Prey isn't a novel--it's just a sloppy treatment of the film (complete with some interesting ideas for cool special effects courtesy of the author)  that will undoubtedly be forthcoming in the next year or so. In this case, the movie is sure to be better than the book.
0375414053|1.0|Like the \\"Bridget Jones\\", though full of fancy, trendy figures and buzz words, trying to be cool in a funny and weird way, it's shallow and pretentious enough for me to cancel my order after reading a couple of chapters of it on Vogue magazine. Bottom line, I couldn't see any reality on Kate. A real working mom like me works first for money to support the family, can't afford expensive shopping to reward ourselves and vocations with a nanny, and day after day we take care of things all by our own and couldn't even have a quiet, peaceful dinner alone.   <br />The things that really puzzled me was not its unrealistic stories, but how come it became a big hit. I always thought the British has more sophisticated taste on literature or cultural stuff. Was that because of those fancy American terms, like \\"Hillary Clinton's look\\" or episode like flirtation from a young New York millionaire. Where's the solid English literature by its own weight? Lost by its Prime Minister these years?
0790729393|5.0|Sleepers will trick you.  It begins like a funny coming of age movie. Young boys, most of them who are Altar Boys, in Brooklyn checking out girls, snooping in on other peoples confessions, getting into plenty of mischief and basically just being kids (troublemakers but who wasnt, right) and the movie lets you get a good feel of the characters before anything dramatically changes.  It lets you grow to like the boys and lets you get a few laughs in.  The story follows Tommy, John, Michael and Lorenzo \\"Shakes\\" on their shinanigans until something that was meant to be a prank goes terribly wrong.  It takes them to a dark path in a youth correctional facility called \\"wilkensons home for boys\\" where they are beaten daily, raped daily and during one point you watch one as he is left for dead in solitary confinement.  You watch as the boys lives are forever changed.  Sleepers is 2 stories connected by the people involved in the story.  Michael grows into a successful lawyer, Shakes grows into a writer , and john and tommy turn into notoriously known hardened criminals.  One day John and Tommy find one Sean Nokes (a particulary rememberable abusive guard) and fill him from head to toe with bullets.  After years of keeping the horrors of Wilkensons a secret to both friends and family, including their best friend Carol (grown up carol played by Mimi Driver, shes AMAZING in this film) and their life long friend and mentor Father Bobby (Robert Deniro).  When John and Tommy are convicted of the murder of sean nokes lorenzo and michael are left with a painful decision, let their friends be possibly put to death or get help, help which will require telling their story.  The movie follows the trial and choices that are made.  One by one the boys, now men are faced with the question \\"how far will you go to get your and the ones you loves past at rest.\\"  YOULL NEVER FORGET SLEEPERS.  YOULL NEVER FORGET ANY CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE AND YOULL NEVER FORGET THAT THIS IS THE TRUE STORY OF THESE BOYS, THIS REALLY HAPPENED.... (sleepers is based on the true story \\"sleepers\\" by Lorenzo Carcatera)
0800129806|4.0|&quot;First Knight&quot; may never reach the heights of acclaim like &quot;Excalibur,&quot; but this re-telling of the legend of King Arthur is, in my opinion, just as good as &quot;Excalibur&quot; if not better. Sean Connery IS the fabled king of Camelot, and Julia Ormond is vibrant and beautiful as Guinevere. Richard Gere as Launcelot is the only part of this film that keeps it from getting five stars. The rest of the film, however, is great. Add it to your collection today! Grade: A-

Its weak, pure and simple.<br />The first time we played it we advanced to the second track after a few minutes.  Into a bit of the second track we simply turned it off and thought we would try it another time.  Its been on twice since and we still have not made it through the album.

6302732875|5.0|This is quite simply one of the finest films I've seen.  The story is able to be told in its purest form.  The actors are allowed to act without interference of any extraneous material.  Every performance is first rate, and that Lemmon was virtually ignored at awards time was absolutely criminal
B00003CXA6|4.0|...albeit a bit stilted in places. Still, in all, a VERY emotionally moving film. There are some moments that are among the most powerful ever put to film while there are others that are completely wooden and lifeless. The sheer affrontery of casting Martin \\"Can I GET Anymore Liberal\\" Sheen as General Robert E. Lee has to rank as one of THE great casting faux pauxs in film history. I laugh every time I see him get that spacey \\"I've been smokin' too much of the weed\\" look in his eyes as he waxes eloquent about God ot \\"the great cause\\". But Daniels and Elliot (among others) are absolute strokes of casting genius. They capture the very essence of their characters and make it look easy in doing so. All in all, this is a very rewarding and moving film experience and I would highly recommend it to movie lovers in general and Civil War buffs in particular. It tends to run a bit long, but I would imagine it was the only way to do any justice to the material.<br />Oh, and by the way...in answer to the following: \\"Maybe someday a filmmaker with access to a HUGE budget and all the latest CGI and special effects technology will do for Pickett's Charge what Speilberg did for Omaha Beach; but I'm not going to hold my breath waiting.\\" <br />Well. The waiting is over. 'Gods And Generals' cometh! I cannot WAIT! Robert Duvall as Lee? Positively inspired. I am sold on the strength of the trailer alone.
B000002JST|5.0|Let There Be Rock is an amazing attempt to show that this Aussie band can stand up to any other rock and roll bands releases.<BR> Virtually unheard of in America at the time, AC/DC's fury would not be quiet for long.The most amazing thing I find about this recodring besides Angus Young's guitar work is the vocals of Bon Scott. This guy does not sound like any singer before him.<BR>Produced at maximum velocity, if this album doesnt grab your ghost, you are probaly dead
B00003CXXM|4.0|First off, when I first heard that they were making a movie version of Robert Ludlum's novel, I had mixed feelings. I had read and thoroughly enjoyed the book many years ago and knew that it had been adapted into a TV movie back in 1988, with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, although I have to confess that I never did get around to seeing it for fairly obvious reasons. <br />So why the mixed feelings? Partly because, for a variety of reasons, movies rarely if ever live up to the novels on which they are based. Maybe this is because we have our own rigidly set perceptions of what the characters look like or because we are already familiar with the plot. Sometimes studios rewrite the plots of our favourite novels and the movie adaptation ends up being so dissimilar to the book that everything that was good about it has either been lost in the editing, or changed to the story's detriment. <br />In the case of The Bourne Identity, the novel is a pretty substantial affair, full of plots and sub-plots, which would be pretty hard to cram into a mere 2 hours, without making significant changes. The Bourne Identity's script was reportedly written and re-written countless times. It took two years to shoot and, during this time, Matt Damon completed two other movies (Ocean's Eleven and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron). With this kind of background it is almost a wonder that this film was ever completed and as a result pre-release expectations were none too high. However, against all odds, Doug Liman (Go, Swingers) has produced a slick and competent thriller.<br />Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac found drifting in the Mediterranean sea after being pumped full of lead and left for dead. After being rescued by a fishing boat and nursed back from to health our hero sets off from Marseille with the intention of trying to rekindle his lost memories. Along the way, much to his bemusement, he not only finds himself pursued by shadowy would-be assassins, he discoversthat he has skills and instincts that suggest that he himself may also be a ruthless trained killer. <BR>   <BR>So cue some great action sequences; several impressive fight scenes and an excellent car chase through Paris and enough of the original novel's twists and turns to keep the audience interested. Plus, throw in Franka Potente as an interesting female lead and unwilling companion, Clive Owen and Brian Cox in good supporting performances and two hours slip seamlessly by. However, although detractors will point out that The Bourne Identity is probably not the most memorable movie you will ever see (true), it is also fair to say that this is good old fashioned Saturday night at the movies entertainment and definitely worth a watch if you are looking for something undemanding. Matt Damon, excellent in The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting as a credible action hero?  Now there's a pleasant surprise and with several sequels penned by the late author Robert Ludlum, we may not have yet seen the last of Mr Bourne.
B000084T18|5.0|I think that this cd is one of the best cds that I have ever bought.   I love this cd  some of the songs are just great I can listen to every song over and over there is about 6 songs that I think are great.  In Da Club is a great song to listen to over and over...Wanksta is pretty tight too...P.I.M.P is a funny and a really good song with a good beat....21 Questions is one of my favorite songs on the cd I love the song....Many Men is a good song too...and Patiently Waiting with Eminem is a great song also I think that all of these songs get 4.5 to 5 stars they are all great songs....the rest of the cd is great I recommend it to anyone and everyone...
B00007E8V4|4.0|For some reason, SOAD has a different more furverent sound than some of the other bands out there. But anyway, that's already known. What I don't understand is why wasn't there a second disc to the Toxicity album. I mean instead of releasing 3 different versions of the album, make a 2 disc set with unreleased material, no, they have to release this and say it's outtakes and stuff they didn't want on the CD at that time. It's just frustrating. Anyway, the songs on this CD though are very good. The disc is good, but I just wish the songs were better and more put together. They just seem awfully rushed. But still if you're a hardcore SOAD fan, then pick this up but if you aren't one of the few who already \\"stole this album\\" on the Internet, don't waste your time, because it's only worth it for hardcore fans. You won't recognize any of the songs because only one is played on the radio and its not a big hit.

I could go into why I think everyone should read it, but i don't think I will. Because I think the beauty of this book is the pieces of themselves that each person finds when they read it. It was extremely poetic and beautiful to me for my reasons and I hope you will find your own reasons to find it beautiful. ...
B00005JL3A|5.0|Simply, this was a nice reward for the scores of video game fans out there waiting for the next Mortal Kombat. Yeah it's basically the next generation \\"trapped with dead people\\" film but it has a wicked style that makes it stand out from the other zombie flicks. What really shocked me was the acting. It's about time we got people on the screen who can carry a line as well as shotgun. As far as the DVD the highlight was surprisingly the commentary. Paul, Milla, and Michele are hilarious. Commentaries are usually straight forward and a little on the dull side but this trio of crackups just had me rolling on the floor. Yes it's true Resident Evil is not ... and worth the cash.
B000068TSI|5.0|One quite night with nothing better to do I rented the most touching and most remembered movie I will ever see.(We Were Soldiers).  By the end of this movie I was sitting on the edge of my seat.  My uncle was in the vietnam war he was shot by a sniper fortunately he was not killed.  This movie is a must see for the adults of todays world.  What our boys went through over in the Ia Drang valley was a nightmare.  But the herriosm these men diplayed is beyond anything this world will ever experience again.  They not only fought for another country but they fought for themselves.  Lt. Col Hal Moore who is now Retired Lt. Gen Hal Moore resides in my home state of Georgia (Savannah) and I am proud to have this American hero reside in my home state.  I also ran to our local public library after watching this movie and rented the book We Were Soldiers Once and Young written by Hal Moore and a reporter who in the mist of all the fighting found himself right in the middle and had to lay his camera down and pick up a gun to protect himself and others, his name is Jeff Galloway.  If you have not seen this movie you must!  If you have not read this book you must!  Because I felt for me to see this movie and also read this book was a tribute to the men who died in the Ia Drang valley (the valley of death as it was formally called). Not only did these heroic men die in the Ia Drang Valley but they were accompanied in death by 58,000 of their brothers in arms.  This was such a tragedy.  It really makes you stop and think about the condition our world in is today.  Before you rent or buy another movie you gotta see We Were Soldiers!
B000069HKH|3.0|Too many people are just too happy that Springsteen have released a new album. That's the reason for the average rating of 4.5 stars!<br />This album sounds very much like \\"Human touch\\" and \\"Lucky town\\". It's a decent Springsteen effort but the songs are not even close to the standard Springsteen showed on \\"Born in the USA\\", \\"Tunnel of love\\", \\"The river\\" or \\"Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.\\" With hindsight, I suppose this will be very clear.
B00005LMBK|5.0|this is a sweet cd. it features hiphop, electronic, &amp; rock in 1 package. Its the perfect cd to play if you want a lot of different types of music on one cd. Its not only the variety thats amazing, but that the variety is good. Any hiphop fan should get this album for the smash hit clint eastwood and rock the house.  this cd also contains some good experimental trax like sound check and left hand suzuki method. Get this album. Be sure to check out g-sdies too, another great album. If you like dub and/or reggae, get a copy of laika comes home.
B000002KHB|5.0|&quot;Machine head&quot; from 1972 shows Deep Purple at their prime, and is without competition the best album in the bands career. From the opening &quot;Highway star&quot; (usually a concert opener) we get a feeling of what to expect. The following &quot;Maybe I'm a leo&quot; and &quot;Pictures of home&quot; are among the best Purple songs ever. &quot;Never before&quot; is good but not outstanding. Then comes &quot;Smoke on the water&quot; (the world's most known song?) that of course doesn't need any comment, followed by a blues tune: &quot;Lazy&quot;. The album ends with &quot;Space trucking&quot; - the only one below average. <br />If you only want one Deep Purple album, this is the one!
B000000993|4.0|Like most bands, Tool have established the logical process of improving significantly with each release.  Opiate was their first, appropriating their musical style, and giving audiences a taste of what they had to offer.  It was slightly experimental, and lacked overall solidity, but it was still intriguing.  They went on to release Undertow, the album which helped them break mainstream.  The production here is clean, and the songs (for the most part) have a common, formulated structure which you'd epxect from the average metal band.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when contrasted to Aenima, and especially Lateralus, Undertow wasn't really all that special.  <br />As it is their sophomore album, it is very sophomoric.  They were still developing at this stage, and certainly lacked some of the inspiration which they possess today.  That isn't to say that they weren't fine musicians, with good song-writing skills and a talent for creating dark, cerebral tracks.  However, they succumbed to common symptoms of beginning metal bands, such as over-repetition, lack of consistency and overused hooks.  All this said, this was still a decent album, well worth picking up.  There are two songs on here (\\"Prison Sex\\" and \\"Sober\\") which are some of Tool's all-time classic songs.  Just don't expect the rest of the album to be that way.<br />If I could, I would have given this album 3 and a half stars, but that wasn't an option, so I rounded up.  <br />For a better demonstration of Tool's musical virtuosity, pick up Lateralus, which is absolutely epic in its complexity and quality.
B000000OY9|1.0|Sometimes \\"Landing on water\\" is on sale but even if this one was for free I wouldn't take it. It's so amazingly bad I can't find the words. So if you're unfamiliar with Neil Young and see this one on sale, and start to think that maybe it's time to explore Neil Young...RESIST! Do not touch this album (at least not as your first Neil Young) cause the risk is very high that you'll never look at another record by Mr. Young - and that would be a pity. Instead of this one you should get \\"Harvest\\", \\"After the gold rush\\" and \\"Comes a time\\".
B00005BCOL|5.0|This movie is tops, its a classic of gossip, marriages, scandal, he said, she said, knives in backs, cutthroat, but most of all this movie teaches What Goes Around Comes Around. A lot of the movies of 1930s about these same subjects didn't succeed, this one is tops. I love Myrna Loy, I wish Myrna Loy would of been in this movie, I can picture her in this film. I didn't think much of Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer before seeing this movie. But they were very talented actresses. Even though most of the women didn't get along on the set, they all needed each other to make the movie a hit. Virginia Grey and Paulette Goddard were my favorite. Virginia Grey was beautiful, in the little scene she had, she had a presence and her presence is known, I wish she would of done more in the movie and in Hollywood. Rosalind Russell was something else, she was one of the top female comedians, but I wish the fight scene between her and Paulette Goddard could of been more juicy and action packed like the remake of The Women- The Opposite Sex, but anyways I know  I'm sure every woman knows Rosalind Russell kind, gossiping about everybody else, but hates when people gossips about her, and most of all her own home isn't taken care of. I love it when her man leave her for another woman, every knows but her, she didn't like it when the tables turned on her. But at least Norma Shearer was a lady, Rosalind Russell acted as a baby. This movie was a stepping stone for such new actresses like Joan Fontaine, Paulette Goddard, Virginia Grey and others, and this movie was also like a last hurrah for Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer who was about to leave MGM and was considered old by Hollywood standards, the good roles were going to other young starlets. Rosalind Russell was right in the middle of her successful career. One funny thing about this movie, the women who are gossiping don't think their gossiping, they think its INFORMATION. Women can learn something from this film, men cheating on their wives with younger women to make them feel young, so its just a phase, Norma Shearer knew her man would come back, she didn't let her gossiping friends mess with her mind, Norma Shearer had it all planned it out. I was reading some other posts that said some people will think this movie is old-fashion, times change, Cheating mates is and old game, the only difference is women today will fight, women back then was smart like Norma Shearer. Women like Joan Crawford character think they got it all and will win over the wife, but she gets hurt everytime. Women like Rosalind Russell character are still around and acive, I bet we women can name those, we might had them as friends, one thing I know about women like Rosalind Russell character is that they gossip about everybody else business, but their business at home isn't taken care of, and they hate when people gossip about them. There should be more women like Norma Shearer character. This film is good, regardless of age, race, generation. They don't make movies ilke this no more. This was made in 1939. but nothing old-fahion about this movie. The only lesson learned in this movie is What goes around, comes around. Right will win over wrong.
B00005NI5Y|1.0|I must admit that I'm not a big fan of Bob Dylan. Those of you who are, have already bought this album (and there's no need for all of you to tell me that this review wasn't helpful) I'm writing this one primary for those non die hard fans out there who wants top know if this album really is so good as many claim...<br />I own a couple of Dylan albums (\\"Blood on the tracks\\", \\"Desire\\", \\"Train a coming\\" + a compilation) and I must say that although I really gave this one a chance I can barely stand it. The only song in my opinion that is fairly good is \\"Mississippi\\". The music isn't exciting or unique in any way and the vocals still sounds like a man so drunk he can barely talk...<br />What if the name on the sleeve wasn't Bob Dylan but say John Smith? Think about it...would you still praise this one?
1556589433|5.0|The incomparable Meryl Streep unleashes a devastating Academy Award performance (her second, but her only one as Best Actress to date) in this powerful and shattering tale of a Polish immigrant who survives the horrors of Hitler's Holocaust and the choice she is forced to make to her Nazi captors: which of her two children to sacrifice to the death camps. Setting out in post-war Brooklyn, the film introduces Sophie and an aspiring writer (a very young Peter McNicol) who live together with Sophie's tempestuous lover (Kevin Kline, in an amazing dramatic turn). Through flashbacks, director Alan J. Pakula guides us on an intelligent and probing but grippingly painful look at the horrors that War War II was to the millions of Hitler's victims and the extremes that his prisoners undertook to survive. Paluka's blend of Sophie's life in nostalgic Brooklyn and in the concentration camps of World War II is horrific in its effectiveness as it accentuates the absolute terror and inhumanity of the Holocaust. But that dramatic strategy might not have worked with any actress other than Streep. She is simply that devastating and wholly believeable with her perfect Polish accent and her decimated physical appearance because of her time in the custody of her Nazi victimizers. With that one performance, Streep managed to raise the level of leading actresses and likely earned her the distinction of being one of the industry's most respected performers ever. Her raw and honest emotional trauma makes \\"Sophie's Choice\\" a well-worthy watching, and the film's subject matters reminds us once again of the evil that man can do.
B00005JL78|5.0|There are very few movies out there that can make you smile.  I'm not just talking about happy go lucky movies, but movies that rivet you with something magical that no other movie contains.  The Star Wars trilogy did this, The Matrix did this...Minority Report does this.<br />John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is a police officer that works for a futuristic unit called Precrime.  This division uses three individuals called the Precogs that can see the future to stop murders before they happen.  Cruise firmly believes in the ability of the Precogs, as well as their accuracy, yet is fed a taste of his own medicine when the Precogs predict a murder that he, himself, will commit.  As a morality tale and as far as the message behind the whole movie was concerned, I was unimpressed, but this was taken away from the sheer magic of the movie's visual effects and the rich individual stories of the characters.  <br />Every element of this movie is spectacular.  There are fine performances from Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell, the special effects are some of the best since The Matrix, the story is spectacular and it holds your attention for the duration.  You feel caught up in the story, a part of it, which is why you can't turn away, wanting to see what will happen next.  <br />I predict you are running out the door right now to buy this...make me right.
6300183211|4.0|An astoundingly gifted Al Pacino had not been an established \\"star\\" very long when he took on the title role in this dark and gritty 1982 remake by director Brian DePalma of the 1932 film of the same time. In numerous subsequent televised bios of Pacino, it's been widely reported that his performance here is his favorite in what is undisputably a stellar career. But Pacino has good reason, despite what many critics decried at film's release to be excessive and gratuitious violence. As a Cuban immigrant escaping Castro's communist regime, Pacino lands in Miami Beach where he guns his way to the top of the lucrative international drug trade. As a drug lord who also happens to abuse the merchandise, Pacino gradually slips into that dark, drug-induced conclave from which return is hopeless. Its consequence extends beyond Pacino to destroy not only him but his best friend-turned business associate, his family and his wife. Of the latter, a then-relatively unknown and breathtakingly beautiful Michelle Pheiffer turns in a riveting performance as the woman kept by drug lords but earns her own salvation by seeing the cost of international drug smuggling and addiction. The film may well be the best performance in Pacino's magnificent body of work.
B00005JLF5|5.0|While I won't go so far as to call this the best Trek series ever, as it isn't, it definetly is a refreshing change from TNG and the ever boring Voyager. As reruns are impossible to find, I am looking forward to buying this set of DVDs to own, something I wouldn't consider with TNG or Voyager.
B000069CWE|2.0|Let me start off by saying I am one of the biggest Linkin Park fans you will find out there. After I first heard One Step Closer on the radio I have been hooked. I have gone to see them in concert and I even bought their first cd twice (because i accidentally lost my first one). BUT WHAT IS THIS??? THIS ISN'T LINKIN PARK!...P>I hated almost every single thing about this album. I know I couldn't expect much from a remix album, but this was ridiculous. It seems like they almost put zero effort into this album, they just got a bunch of hip-hop artists to come and make guest appearances... that is not whut I bought the album for!...<br />Probably my BIGGEST grievance with this album is the way they tried to change the lyrics of some of my favorite songs that I have grown to know by heart. How can you change the lyrics to a perfect song, I don't understand. Especially on \\"In The End\\", \\"Forgotten\\", and others I can't remember at the moment. Half of the songs sounded nothing like the songs I used to listen to everyday for 6 months straight.  <br />And whut is with all the rapping and little skits??? this isn't a Jay-Z album it is friggin Linkin Park!... come on guys...<br />There are however some high points to this album. For example, I believe that they vastly improved on songs like Points of Authority and Krawling in the new album. The lead singer from staind is without a doubt the best guest appearnace on the album in Krawling, but 2 great songs out of 20 [bad] ones is not good enough for me. <br />So In the end, I cannot reccommend this album to anyone who enjoyed Hybrid Theory. I cannot believe the guys in Linkin Park actually thought they could get away with this. Just download points of authority and krawling and dont waste your time with any of the other songs, they are definatly not worth your time. I am praying to God that the guys won't mess up Meteora. Cross Your Fingers!
0440180295|4.0|Vonnegut is without a doubt an excellent author. His novels, both shockingly tender and painfully cynical, compose a body of work that ranks among the best satire ever written. The problem with \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\", however, is that it has received much more attention than it is due. It is one of the few books of Vonnegut's that I have read and felt disappointed with.<br />Because this novel is promoted so heavily in university's and high schools, and a beloved of many critics, it is unpopular to criticize it. And while it is a strong argument against war, and marks a turning point in Vonnegut's writing, as well as being an early example of post-modernism, it simply isn't that satisfying a read.<br />Perhaps it is because Pilgrim is a more difficult character to empathize with than Kilgore Trout or Eliot Rosewater, the protagonists in other novels who make an appearance in \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\". It may also be that Vonnegut hasn't quite gotten his new style down pat, and so when he leaps from idea to idea and place to place it doesn't always seem to work quite right, the way it does in \\"Breakfast of Champions\\".<br />Whatever the case, anyone interested in reading Vonnegut should almost certainly begin with \\"Cat's Cradle\\", and move outward from there. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" will show you Vonnegut at his best, and keep you hungry for more, even when you trip over the occasional novel like this one.
0060537639|4.0|Gavin Menzies has hit upon a mystery no less intriguing than the pyramids, alien visitation, and the origin of Native Americans.  Could the Chinese have discovered virtually every continent decades or centuries before the europeans?  Are early Chinese explorers the compilers of so many early maps; maps that aided the european explorers that followed them?  The list of questions goes on and on.  According to Mr. Menzies in 1421: The Year China Discovered America, the Chinese did all of this and much, much more.  But Carl Sagan once said that extraordinary claims call for extraordinary proof.  And that's the problem with this book.  The proof in most cases isn't scientific but rather based on hunches.<br />1421: The Year China Discovered America certainly isn't short on research.  Menzies takes his time spinning his theory, a dab of evidence here and a dab of evidence there.  But in the end the whole idea is based on a house of cards.  One nagging thought I kept having while I was reading this is why the Chinese didn't sail up the Thames?  They went everywhere else/<br />One thing is apparently clear from reading this book.  The history we've been taught in school and have come to believe as true can't be complete.  While I don't accept all that Menzies has to sell, I do believe that he is correct in that the Chinese had more contact with civilizations around the world than we have thought true.  Is everything he says true.  Hardly.  But I believe he has hit upon some tantalizing ideas.  Better research from better sources in the future may make what is dim and blurry as clear as truth.
B00006RJHG|5.0|This new DVD edition is so much better than the older 25th Anniversary DVD. It is now presented in Widescreen and with a new Dolby 2.0 audio mix, and the old original Mono audio mix for the diehard fans out there. The picture, while not perfect, is quite good for an older movie such as this. I don't believe it is presented in Anamorphic format, but that is only a minor complaint.<br />The DVD also features Interviews, Alternate credit openings, Trailers, TV spots, Radio spots, Still gallery, etc... There are two full-length commentaries, the first is with director Bob Clark and the second is with actors John Saxon and Keir Dullea. Both commentaries provide some interesting tidbits. Another thing to mention is that the cover is reversible to either the new red/black artwork, or you can flip it over to display the original artwork.<br />There is also a hidden easter egg which allows you to pop the disc into a DVD-ROM drive and access the bonus full script and various press releases. I won't give away exactly how you can find the easter egg, but it's not very difficult to locate!<br />If you are a fan Black Christmas then you need this edition, take a pass on the cheaper 25th anniversary DVD. It's a little more expensive but is well worth it.
0385508417|5.0|This is one book that should be in everyone's library and read over and over again. Grisham has captured the spirit of the holiday in a humorous, and eventually moving, way. I've bought several copies of this book just to give to friends. If you haven't read it, grab it now. If you have read it then you have to agree with me. It's quite possibly one of the most entertaining books out there.
B000002UAR|5.0|Quite simply the greatest album by the greatest band of all-time. A mind boggling collage of perfect songcraft and sheer sonic joy, Revolver, like its predecessor Rubber Soul, stunned the pop world when released in 1966. <br />In terms of Beatle evolution, Revolver catches the Fabs in the midst of their most perfect phase -- more sophisticated than the Mop-Top years of 1963-64, yet more restrained than the experimental Later Years. Lush psychedelic tones flourish throughout, enhancing, yet never overwhelming the colorful song textures. Witness George's painstaking backward guitar solo on &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; for a textbook example of innovation with restraint. Mesmerizing rhythmic structures, which pop-up all over, may well be the most inventive of the band's career. Ringo's percussive tom rolls transform John's single-chord  mind-bender &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; into the most hypnotic three-minutes of acid-drenched pleasure ever recorded. Never have Beatle guitars sounded so bright, trebly and as bitingly distorted as they do on &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; and &quot;She Said, She Said&quot;. On the gentle flipside are the baroque sophistication of &quot;For No One&quot; and the epic neo-classicism of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. Gently washed in the mournful hues of George Martin's perfectly scored string arrangement, &quot;Eleanor&quot; emerges as Paul's most mature and, quite possibly, most beautiful song. Sing-a-long classics &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; prove that fun was indeed still fashionable in the Swingin' Summer of '66.<br />Every aspect of Revolver--from the biting social commentary of &quot;Taxman&quot; to the childish joyride of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;-- clicks so perfectly. A 1996 Mojo Reader's Poll ranked Revolver as the greatest album ever recorded. But Revolver, like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, is more than merely a great rock album-- it is unquestionably one of the 20th Century's greatest works of art.
0767812646|5.0|This movie is an all-time great. Oliver, a workhouse orphan, runs away seeking maternal love. he joins up with a gang of pickpockets, and rubs the rough Bill Sykes the wrong way. Oliver goes to court for getting caught with his hands in another guy's pocket, Even though it wasn't his hand, but the hand of Jack Dawkins, or 'The artful Dodger'. Oliver ends up becoming friends with the man who started the suit, and, after many problems and near-bill-sykes- escapes, Oliver is adopted by the kindly Mr. Brownlow.<BR>The music is awesome, all the songs are great (Except, in my personal opinion 'he needs me'. I have never liked the slow songs. However, everyone to their tastes)After watching this movie 30 or 40 times, I found myself skipping to all the songs, much to my mother's chagrin, as it gets old to constantly hear 'Consider yourself'. A wonderful movie.
B000002MP2|5.0|Lots of credit to Green Day for creating a terrific album that was more fun than almost every angst-ridden album of the grunge era.  The amazon review says they're one part Ramones, one part Buzzcocks, one part Husker Du.  I don't see Husker Du so much as I see the Undertones, who might be the band they are most similar to, because of the lighthearted lyrical approach of both.<br />My respect for this only grows as I hear the unlistenable pop-punk bands of today (Simple Plan, Blink 182, Good Charlotte), who somehow take a winning formula and absolutely kill it.  I respect NOFX a little more but I find it hard to really like them.  If you accept that other great bands of the 80's and early '90's who relied on a heavy, poppy sound (i.e. Husker Du, the Pixies and Nirvana) aren't really pop-punk bands at all, then it might be safe to say that Green Day is the only worthy successor to the terrific late-70's bands mentioned at the beginning of this review.<br />(I would probably give this album 4 stars, but in the grade-inflated world of amazon.com, I'll give it 5.  What's the point of praising an album if your review will actally drag down the average rating?)
B00003CXZ4|5.0|As great as this movie is...it's not for everyone.<br />That being said, I'll tell you why I see it as a WOW! Christopher Nolan has created a piece that is unmatched in it's originally and is on par with 'The Usual Suspects' in terms of storytelling at it's finest. The script is tight, and the performances (Guy Pearce...if you haven't heard of him yet, trust me...you will!) are solid.<br />The fact this film is told backwards gives you an intimate 'bond' with the protagonist, in that you can't remember what happened before either, and this adds a dimension that few films can project. But, you can't 'leave' for a second. If you have to do anything, pause it, because little clues are left all throughout the movie, and the different way the story is told can also leave you feeling lost if you miss some of it.<br />This is a true gem of a film that it's a shame it didn't get more buzz early on.
B00005JKZT|2.0|I had already read the book by the time I watched Two Towers, unlike with FOTR. I liked FOTR, saw it twice in theaters and twice in DVD (original and expanded versions). And you know what? I never tired of it. Of course, I did have to stifle a yawn, but nothing that can't be cured by hitting the pause button, gulping a cup of coffee and resuming.<br />So I had great expectations for Two Towers. I mean, I liked the book. The movie has to be very good.<br />Somewhere before the end of the movie, when Treebeard - going back to his home after the entmoot concluded with the ents saying \\"this is not our war\\" - had got his first eyeful of the desolation around Isengard, the old ent was suddenly at a loss for words. Somewhere in the old Entish, he said, there must be a word to describe what he just saw, but couldn't figure out what it was. I almost wanted to scream: BETRAYAL! It would have been a perfect fit, both for what Saruman did, and for what the filmmakers did.<br />I am not by any means a book fanatic. I've read a few, but the titles alone of the books I've NOT read will fill an entire book. But I've read the Lord of the Rings, and I know I don't like what I saw in the movie. My seat-of-the-pants meter does not lie, Two Towers left me cramped, tired and bored. I'm not sure I'll ever watch it again, or even buy it in video form.<br />Yes, there are the character changes, not only to Faramir and the ents, but also to Gandalf, Legolas and Theoden. Those who justify those changes as necessary because time is too short to flesh out the narrative apparently ignore that the filmmakers actually spent considerable time too in showing the alterations. Those precious minutes could have been spent staying faithful to the story, or to its spirit.<br />Faramir- IMO, the whole trouble of getting to Osgiliath and showing that Faramir was no more than a poor copy of his brother was a waste of screen time. Those who say the changes in Faramir's character were OK and consistent with the idea that the Ring is irresistible to men have not been watching/reading the story. The Ring is not irresistible, otherwise there would have been no hope. Tom Bombadil is not affected by it. Galadriel, a \\"senior\\" and wise elf, desires it (although she resisted), yet the Ring had no effect on young Legolas whatsoever. Gimli could have withstood it, after all, dwarves have always been difficult subjects for Sauron, and somehow, the Ring has no effect on Gimli either! Boromir fell to it, but Aragorn, as was plain to see, did not. The hobbits Gollum, Bilbo and Frodo found it hard to give the Ring up, yet Sam gives it away without much thought. Obviously the Ring's effect on people is not uniform.<br />Now, suppose we stay faithful to the book and Faramir ignores the Ring and sends Frodo on his way. Is that too much to ask? <br />Ents - in the novel, the Ents not only destroy Isengard, they also help save the day at the Hornburg. In the third part, in the Appendix, we see that the Ents also protect Rohan while Theoden marches to Gondor to aid Denethor. Instead in the movie, the Ents, after a long discussion, decide not to interfere (\\"This is not our war\\"), only to be roused by one cry from Treebeard. What is this, Pearl Harbor? And the Ents were not terrifying enough, they were too slow. Couldn't Jackson at least watch a marauding bull elephant on National Geographic and take it from there?<br />Gandalf in the movie also regards Theoden as incapable of making sound decisions, and thinks that the retreat to Helm's Deep was an act of suicide. But in the book, it was Gandalf who tells Theoden to scrap the plan to go to the Fords and proceed directly to Helm's Deep. Above all his tricks (only few of which he displayed), Gandalf's greatest magical act is his capacity to TRUST the free peoples of Middle Earth, to see the good in them.  He alone trusted the hobbits with anything important (Bilbo, Frodo, etc.) and he certainly trusted men.<br />Also in the movie, Gandalf asksAragorn to look after Theoden before the old man hurts himself. What was that about? Aragorn was a great hero, but the fact is, at the time in question, he had no army, and only his sword to offer. He's practically a guest, a freelance. He's supposed to look after the Rohirrim who are hopelessly clueless? And why leave them to the care of this weak-kneed movie version of Aragorn? This Aragorn could not have descended from Elendil, Elros, Beren or Barahir.<br />Legolas actually lost hope in this movie, and it took Aragorn's \\"I will die with them\\" (a rare display of strength) to convince him the battle is worth fighting. I always thought Legolas had no fear, except when he saw his first Balrog. And he recovered even from that.<br />Again, there is this tendency to prolong the battle scenes, obviously to sell the movie. The important reunion of the hobbits with their friends and their meeting with Theoden (Merry and Theoden, remember?) was omitted. All for an extended battle that still falls short of exciting. And what were the elves doing in Rohan shooting in unison? The fairest, most creative of the peoples of Middle Earth, reduced to mere automatons? Aragorn directing the archers? Didn't we see enough of that in FOTR's intro?<br />Do I dislike the movie because of these changes? No, it's because the changes were not even worth the trouble. And oh, did I get tired, and bored and sleepy!
B00005B1W5|5.0|I first saw this video on a TV telecast in Singapore. I was mesmerised. I immediately bought a video (PAL). Then, when I came over to the US, I had to buy an NTSC video, and recently, this DVD. I am sure I may have to buy a Non-Region 1 DVD of this at a later time when I leave the US. The only thing I hate is this PAL/NTSC business, and the region coding on DVDs. It doesn't help in stopping piracy in any case, which they claim to achieve by doing this. But come what may, I am always going to watch this production whichever corner of the world I may be in.
B00005ALP6|5.0|A heartwarming movie. Rex harrison and Audrey Hepburn PLay awesomely together. The songs are great, but no words can do justice to this movie's grace. The covent garden scene is one of the best in the movie. If you like movies such as Oliver, Breakfast at Tiffany's or any of the Rodgers and Hammerstein's, then you will love this movie. Perfect for the days when it's cold, rainy, and you just want a cup of coffee and a snuggle.
B000063COX|5.0|This debut by Maiden is simply fantastic. Energetic, a little bit punk, heavy, coming from the heart. The lyrics were to improve dramatically in their posterior albums, because here they are extremely silly.<br />This was the last album by Maiden featuring guitarrist Dennis Stratton. Because he was  just a little bit older than the other guys, and because he listened to a lot of different musical styles other than metal, Dennis usually prefered to travel in the bus that carried the KISS road crew, when Maiden toured with Kiss along Europe, in 1980. THe boss Steve Harris did not like it, and that was the last straw for him: Dennis was fired and lost an once in a lifetime opportunity for glory and fortune...<br /> In came Dave Murray´s old pal, Adrian Smith, and the rest is history...
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film will still be making people think in 20 years. Excellent and original storytelling along with an amazing soundtrack. Go see it!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Yes it is true. My 47 year old (far from pop music fan!) liked this. The story? I left this in the CD player in my living room, and my dad (Mr. Snoopdog!) listened to it. When I came home from school, he told me that he thought it was good music. So I guess I would recommend this to anyone who likes pop, young or old. And if you like inspirational songs, I seriously hope you consider \\"Crash and Burn\\".<br />Here is the track list with MY comments:<BR>1. Affirmation: ***- Odd, medium tempo song. Darren saying what he believes in. Not one of the highlights, but still worth a listen!<BR>2. Hold Me: *****- Georgeous. I really like this!!<BR>3. I Knew I Loved You: ****- A little overplayed, but still really nice!!<BR>4. The Best Thing: ****- The only up-tempo song I enjoyed! I like the beat!! Sometimes I skip this, but I like it!<BR>5. Crash and Burn: *****- Okay, this is my absolute favorite!! I love the lyrics. This is a great cheer up song!!<BR>6. Chained To You: **- No, I haven't listened to it. But, from what I have seen of the lyrics, I DON'T want to!!<BR>7. The Animal Song: **- See #6.<BR>8. The Lover After Me: ***- once again, Not one of the highlights, but still worth a listen!<BR>9. Two Beds And A Coffee Machine: *****- Weird title, but beautiful song. Piano piece is really good, and it is sung well.<BR>10. You Can Still Be Free: *****- Weird song, and I didn't like it at first, but it is now one of my faves on album.<BR>11. Gunning Down Romance: **- See #6 & #7.<BR>12. I Don't Know You Anymore: ****- Perfect way to end CD!! I enjoy this!!<br />This is definitely more enjoyable than their first album, and it is really sad that Savage Garden broke up. They ARE one of my fave bands!!

B00005TT77|1.0|I can't believe that this would happen! Has everyone gone stupid? These bands have taken the rights to some of the worlds greatest songs and gave them to the likes of Eddie Vedder! What has the world come to? I get so mad just thinking about it! I can't believe that Sarah Mclachlan can live with herself after what she did to Blackbird. Have I fallen off the planet Earth... Am I in some parrellel universe where this type of thing is acceptable? Please someone tell me... I'd like to get back to where people don't mess up good music with there &quot;so called talent&quot;. I just think this is insane! I bet anything that John Lennon and George Harrison are rolling in their graves as I write this. It is my opinion that anyone who likes this CD has no idea or concept of good music... These are the same people that listen to Kenny G and Yanni, They have no idea of what music should sound like. If you want to hear the actual song, the good music, type in The Beatles in the search box and check out Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or Rubber Soul, That's what music should sound like. If you don't like those then you should stop listening to music all together and just watch T.V. or when your in you car turn on one of those talk radio stations, because you are clueless when it comes to music! Have a nice day and stop polluting the air waves with the likes of this CD. Thank you, enjoy.
B000000WA4|5.0|So there may be a few flaws with the album: There are a few songs I'd rather not listen to.  It's a bit too long to ever reasonably listen to.  It doesn't matter.  Siamese Dream is a great, nearly flawless album--Regardless, this album is The Smashing Pumpkins.  More than that, it represents the 90's generation as a whole.  Many people fear that they will buy the album and than only like the 5 singles (33, 1971, Bullet with Butterfly Wings, Tonight and Zero); fear not.  It is all together possible that you will only like these singles and a few others, but it's still worth having.  These are not just a few MTV picked singles that you listen to a few days: these are 5 of the best songs of all time.  On the other hand, if you get deeper into the album you will be caught up with the complexity and meticulousness which Billy Corgan has placed into each one of his songs.  Even when you hear songs that you may not like, you can still see that he has placed them on the album not just to fill up space, but because there is an individual importance for each song.  It is well worth taking a risk on this album; you can't imagine what your missing.
0064407667|5.0|This was a fun book to read. At a short 160 pages, I was able to read it in one quick setting and look forward to reading the others in the series.<br />My son, age 7, received this series as a Christmas present. He finished the first book, which he read quickly, and started to tell me some of the plot line. Well, my wife and I decided that I better read this book to make sure it was okay for a seven year old.<br />Nothing good happens to these poor children throughout the entire book, but, the events happen in such curious ways, and the writer places much wit into the scenarios that I felt it was fine for him to continue the series. I will say that I believe that it is important for a parent to sit down with their child before allowing them to read this book and explain that it is all in fun. I did this with my son and then he felt better about it.<br />I think that the big problem now will be who gets the next book first!
B0000640VO|5.0|I'll admit it. When I first went to see this movie I was not the least bit excited. A bunch of friends convinced me to go. The only thing going through my mind before the movie began was \\"oh great. A chick-flick foreign movie. this will [be bad].\\" When the movie finally finished, I couldn't stop talking about just what a wonderful movie Amelie was!<br />Amelie is full of little surprises and has such a big heart that you can't help but feel moved by all the characters, especially Amelie herself. This is a movie that should not be passed up by anyone. Instead sit down, relax, pop in the DVD and be prepared to be filled with joy and a big smile :).

B00006690G|5.0|Much has been said and written about this record, Eminem's other albums, the man himself, and the controversial \\"views\\" he affects to express.  I won't go into that, save to say that the present CD, IMO Eminem's finest by far, reveals him to be aware of his persona and its effect.<br />But this is an expertly produced and considered recording, and it leads me, normally a student of \\"serious literature\\", to consider Eminem as a true and original creative artist--and one of the finest popular lyricists of his generation.  Moreover, the melody and metrical difference in the tracks demonstrates an artist who has pushed and shattered the often reductive, bland and predictable genre of hip-hop, the most popular genre of our times.<br />I'm not asking you to approve of the guy or his sentiments.  And I don't think he's T.S. Eliot.  But, on his own terms, he's the finest and most creative rapper there is, and *this*, not the persona or the hoopla, merits a certain respect--and these elements are most evident on this, his finest work thus far.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I saw this film with a lot of skepticism, not because I was worried about whether it is a good representation of the book, but rather because I had never really seen what the big deal about Harry Potter was. However 20 minutes in and I was hooked, getting a drink, or a bag of popcorn be damned, I wanted to watch every moment of the film and was deeply interested. <br />Having gotten interested in the film I checked out the book, and found the film was incredibly close to the book which is always a feat. While having dropped a little bit here and a little bit there Chris Columbus faithfully adapted this beloved children's book. Parents should be warned that the movie contains scenes that might be scary to a young child, but that should not stop you from showing this to your child, or them from enjoying it.<br />The film transfer on the DVD is great, with no problems. The sound is more than adequate, and the overall presentation of the DVD is quite good. <br />Despite being on 2 discs the extras are the let-down here, but they are not horrible, what there is is quite nice but could have been better. The way they could have been better is by adding more extras, and making some difficulty levels so that adults who buy this film can enjoy it every bit as much as children.<br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (or Philosopher's, depending on where you live in the world) Stone is definitely a film that will go down as a classic and will be enjoyed for generations to come, it is now and will be for a long time: simply magical.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is one of the most renouned anti-utopian novels and by far deserves this title. It is about a boy named Jonas trapped in a society commanded by rules and regulations. At the ceremony where the children are to recieve their life long jobs Jonas is given the position of the new \\"giver\\". In this position he is to acquire all the memories and feelings of the past from the old giver. Instead of trying to keep the community \\"alive\\" with this information, as was the original intention, he now realizes that there is a world beyond the confinds of this community. He tries to use his new intelligence to open the eyes of the people around him. Although he knows that they will have to be faced with the bad as well as the good he believes that everyone should know that there is a reality outside of their small isolated world.
B00006FDCD|4.0|For pre-existing fans of this movie, only: Before you buy this DVD, you need to be aware of a few things. One, for some oddball reason, the movie has been released in widescreen format (widescreen makes sense for a theatrical film, but for a TV movie it accomplishes nothing but cutting off some of the picture). Two, there is a little bit of material missing from the beginning of the second half (the scene in which Bill is pestered by Bettiruth, and the shot of Bill in his room asking, \\"What the hell am I doing here?\\") The deleted material isn't that big a deal, and some may say I'm nitpicking, but if you're a perfectionist like myself it's probably going to annoy you. Bottom line: this is a fun (although cheesy) movie hampered by some bone-headed formatting decisions. I sort of wish I'd just held on to my ancient VHS copy and skipped this one (although the commentary track is nice).
B000000WI6|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; on a blues show on the local jazz radio station, I had to get this CD.  Being a longtime Johnny Winter fan, I was not disappointed!  This is some of the hottest blues guitar playing and singing you'll ever hear!  My favorite song is probably the third track, &quot;Life is Hard&quot;, which features some beautiful blues vocals by Johnny as well as a nice piano solo by the legendary Dr. John, who also helps out on three other tracks.  Other noteworthy songs are the title track, &quot;Medicine Man&quot;, &quot;Blue Mood&quot;, &quot;Got to Find My Baby&quot;, and &quot;You Lie Too Much&quot;.  Let's face it, from start-to-finish this is a very enjoyable CD.  Johnny has definitely left his mark as one of the all-time legendary contemporary bluesmen like Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan, and this is a must for any true fan of Johnny Winter and the blues.
B00003CXXM|4.0|The Bourne Identity (2002) is one of this years most unusual action films, tossing aside all that is Matrix style action and going for a more old fashioned style director Doug Liman has found himself with a hit. The action style perfectly portrays the person that Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is supposed to be.<br />After having been left for dead in the Mediterranean Sea, Jason Bourne has no idea what is name is, where he's from, or what he does. The only things he knows scare him and he must find out what he used to do before assassins kill him.<br />With excellent plot twists, well choreographed action scenes (mostly done by Damon), good acting and an intriguing premise, the Bourne Identity is a movie that belongs in any action lover's collection.<br />The only thing that really keeps the DVD from receiving a 5 out of 5 is the extras are less than great, deleted scenes have not been put together very well, and the extras are sparse in general. <br />That said I can't recommend this film enough. Buy it now.
630542845X|5.0|If anyone would want to know what it must be like to be Michael Jackson, this film would be it.   People fear what they do not understand.  Instead of Michael bending spoons, he has other talents such as his music and dancing.  But what makes it truly a wonderful movie, is Michael Jackson has the same type of universal love that Powder has in the film.  This is the most moving movie I have seen in a long time, and it moved me to tears at the end.  There are beautiful people like Powder on this earth in real life.  It is much easier for people to make fun of what they do not understand, instead of grasping the beauty people like Powder have to offer the world.
B00000DGUY|4.0|I had some difficulty deciding my favorite MK/Dire Straits album, and chose this one.  My choices were the early pop driven(but excellent) 'Brothers In Arms\\", and the more recent 'Sailing to Philadelphia.'  I chose this because it represents a broad cross section of their work.  Four of my favorite songs are missing: \\"Wild West End\\", \\"Down to the Waterline\\", \\"Telegraph Road\\", and \\"What It Is-Aubrey Haynie.\\"  Knopfler demonstrates why he is one of the very best guitarists and song writers of rock and roll.
B00005JH7D|5.0|Marcus Miller is one of the top two bassists playing today, and M2 shows that off along with his songwriting and production skills.  The album is very smooth, it's definitely jazz, but it has a very strong R&amp;B feel to it.  It'll thrill and amaze, but mostly it'll make you feel good inside.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Looking back a few years it seems quite extraordinary that any studio would have even thought twice about plowing a multi-million dollar figure into making the rings trilogy. Even if the films were average they by law of averages would still have made a decent profit. When the first installment in the trilogy hit the screens last year it was an awesome sight, this was a film that blended todays modern effects with the traditional scenery that New Zealand had to offer to give a film that not mnay studios make anymore. It's sucess was deserved and it's snub by the major awards for best picture was a joke. <br />Now we have the middle part known as The Two Towers. To see this movie you really have to have seen the first one and I'd imagine quite a few of us have. At the end of the last movie we saw the fellowship split. Frodo and Sam left to continue their journey towards Mordor. Gandalf was seemingly gone while Merry and Pippin were captured leaving Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in the quest to find them. <br />This movie picks up where we left off and follows each of the stories. Each one of them interwoven into the big picture as the ring controls the destiny. By far the most interesting part of the movie is Frodo and Sam's journey, this is because they are joined by Gollum, one of the rings previous holders. Gollum is a split personality, his former self Smeagol destroyed by the rings power. Gollum is a CGI creation voiced by Andy Serkis and is by far the best thing in the movie. The effects work is outstanding and the majority of the time Gollum is incredibly photo realisitic, there has been talk of an Oscar nomination and yes the work by Serkis by doing the voice and performance is that good. <br />Elsewhere the big attraction is battle at helms deep, this is the big set piece that has been talked about for months and it doesn't disappoint. CGI and live action melt together to give the effect of over 10,000 orcs marching towards the walls of Helms Deep. This is sheer blood and guts action as swords cross with flaming torches while explosions reign seige and the rain hammers down. It's a stunning spectacle that has to be seen on the big screen. Because of these two plotlines there has to be somthing that is relegated to the background and that's Merry and Pippin's story, their altercation with Treebeard is great but it's pretty slight in the grand scheme of things and it just feels like we're cutting ack to them to keep them in the whole of the story. However at the end there is a big payoff and once again it's an outstanding work of special effects. <br />I suppose the big question to be asked is \\"Is this as good as the last film?\\". I would say that it isn't purely because there is more than one story to concentrate on and at times you may loose track of what is happening. But compared to everything else this is still an amazing achievement in film-making and one that demands to be seen.
B000000OQF|5.0|My favorite album of all time, i've bought many rock albums since but i still listen to this the most, you just don't tire of the songs. The sound is raw and natural, compared to the slick, overproduced sounds so many bands have today. The riffs are brilliant, its hard to think slash had only been playing guitar 5 years when they released this album. The main reason for this albums timeless quality is in the lyrics though, each song tells a story, whether it be Welcome to the Jungle talking about trying your luck for rock n roll stardom while living in LA's seedy underbelly, or Sweet Child o Mine, which Axl wrote for his girlfriend. The less known songs are the one's you end up listening to the most though, Rocket Queen and Nightrain are brilliant and show some of the albums best guitar work. I recommend this album for any fan of rock, and if you dont like it you obviously have no taste in music.
1573225517|4.0|I did read the book before seeing the movie, but believe John Cusack was the best possible actor for an American version of the book.  In a quirky, semi-neurotic sort of way, Rob portrays an underdog type of persona who chooses to live life by his standards, not that of the current status quo. Cast for the X generation but universal in many themes.  Should women be allowed to see how men actually think?
B00005JKZT|3.0|I have to say that 'The Two Towers\\" is a lot better than the first film (by far). I was fairly impressed by this movie and found it exiting in parts - which kept me awake. Generally better acting this time and with the introduction of new charactors, whom I always forget the wierd names, made for a more enjoyable movie. I noticed the CGI effects appeared more seemless and realistic - but unfortunately we are still getting sweeping aerial shots with thousands of minature people (still looks like a computer game). I'm a firm believer that CGI effects do not make a film better and in a lot of cases it tends to detract from the storyline. Some of the fighting sequences were brilliant towards the end - however the (Predator) Orcs appear to be incredibly week for their huge size - Aragorn and Gimli (apparently invincible) are able to kill vast numbers with ease. What holds this film above the 'Fellowship of The Rings' is the greater development of the main charactors and better pacing. I found Gollum was slightly overdone with the repeated screeching of 'precious' throughout the entire film. Besides this I found the film enjoyable and worth while seeing. Hopefully the third installment will be even better....
B00006SFBD|4.0|As stated before by many other reviewers, this disc is much heavier than other Opeth releases and ultimately NOT as good as the nearly flawless Still Life and Morningrise. By heavier, I mean that it borrows heavily from grindcore and straight -out death metal. The progressive aspect is still there, just more subdued; it takes a few listens to realize how great this album really is. Just be sure to like death metal before purchasing this. Still Life and Blackwater Park sound appealing to non-metalheads, but this is basically Mikael  and co's love letter to the death metal genre. Only Nile can top this in tearms of complexity, brutality, and musical finesse.
0316666343|1.0|The reviewers from Hayward and Holyoke must be the author's mother and publicist, because this novel is neither witty, wise, funny, insightful, compelling, nor heartwarming.  Nice try, Holyoke, but these criticisms are not a reaction to the book having been enormously popular.  Most of the characters in this story deal with death in amazingly dysfunctional ways; any grief counselor who puts her stamp of approval on those reactions should lose their license.
0812550757|4.0|I still like &quot;Ender's Game&quot; best, followed by Xenocide.  But this is still a very good book in the &quot;Ender&quot; series.
0792846443|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies ever made.  The direction by Rob Reiner is just right, well-paced, and makes its way with superb unpredictibility. We get so caught up in James Caan's terrifying dilemma, we're left queasy at every turn as to what loony Kathy Bates will do next.  Caan gives one of his very best performances. There's not a trace of phony melodramatics to be had as he takes in all that is happenening to his character, and makes his every move with utter believability.  One gets the feeling this is the way such a man would behave in real life...not in the movies, where the lead character predictably descends to he-man heroics. When Caan's character finds the solution to his problems, the premise is believable, the resolution deeply satisfying...Bates, however, is an astonishing actress. Her Annie Wilkes is by turns creepy, ridiculous, sinister and crazy; but Bates doesn't &quot;act&quot; crazy...she inhabits the character from within and never falls back into schticky &quot;movie madness&quot; mannerisms(a la Olivia de Havilland in THE SNAKE PIT) Bates's Annie looms terrifyingly real, and the character is a horrifying persona; there's not one false move in any instance. This is a bravura performance, one of cinema's best, that was fully deserving of the highest honors in acting awards.
B000069AT7|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a child.  It is just as good now as it was then.  I didn't really care for the new material and preferred the original version of this film.  I had heard there was a principal scene and was disappointed it wasn't there just to see it, but still I prefer the original.
B000002I99|5.0|Alice had ditched his band and was shooting for the moon when he came up with &quot;Welcome To My Nightmare.&quot; After the disappointing &quot;Muscle Of Love,&quot; he needed to re-establish his preeminence among the imitators that started springing up around him (KISS comes to mind) and prove that, when it came to shock rock, nobody did it better.<br />He scored on all counts. By recruiting producer Bob Ezrin (who was sorely missed on &quot;Muscle&quot;) for sound and actor Vincent Price for a character part, plus putting the whole concept on late night ABC TV - (somebody PLEASE get the DVD rights?), he turned the album into an event. At the time of &quot;Nightmare's&quot; release, there was talk of how Alice had revived showmanship in musical theater and what a brilliant acting talent this man could become, and how under-rated all his prior work had been, etc....and in the years after MTV, it's hard to remember just how outrageous and new a concept video was!<br />This would all be Boa Constrictor poo if the album didn't measure up. The production was far above ANY of the original group albums, and Alice was able explore his continuing fascination with gothic theater in ways his old band mates wouldn't allow. (You will also be better served if you purchase the Rhino Remastered version with bonus tracks.) &quot;Only Women Bleed&quot; was the highpoint of it all, providing Alice with his first cross format hit. (It also led, unfortunately, to far too many sappy songs later in his career.) &quot;Some Folks&quot; was almost vaudevillian in scope (remember the dancing skeletons, with Alice in tux and tails?), and the metal punch of &quot;Escape&quot; proved that Alice could still rock when it counted.<br />&quot;Welcome To My Nightmare&quot; is an album that spawned a million more (think &quot;Destroyer,&quot; &quot;The Wall,&quot; even &quot;Thriller&quot;). It is also, unfortunately, Alice's last great album before too much booze and too few ideas began sapping his strength. Savor this nightmare, because for Alice, the real nightmares were just around the corner.strength. Savor this nightmare, because for Alice, the real nightmares were just around the corner.
B00006DEF9|5.0|If you like musicals and dancing, and you haven't seen Singin' In the Rain, then you should be ashamed of yourself. Just kidding (well.....). This musical has top-notch everything: dancing and musical numbers (\\"Moses Suposes\\", \\"Good Morning\\", \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\", and of course \\"Singin' In the Rain\\"), humor (the hilarious Donald O'Connor as sidekick Cosmo Brown), great acting performances (Gene Kelly as movie star Don Lockwood, and especially Jean Hagen as Don's partner in film, Lina Lamont) and a sweet if not simple plot about love and Hollywood's transition from silent to talking films. Gene Kelly is mesmerizing and magical during his \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" number, one of the best moments in cinema. The whole movie is just so much fun.  The disc of special features is pretty good, with two interesting documentaries, one strictly about Singin' in the Rain (hosted by Debbie Reynolds) and one about Arthur Freed/MGM musicals.  The movie was digitally remastered and looks wonderful, with bright colors and crisp clear images.
B00006RIO7|3.0|The movie musical is not quite the movie event of the year but dazzles enough with nifty choreograpahy and showy sets. Following the revival of the genre in 2001's Moulin Rouge, Chicago is an adaptaion that stays true to the original byut still lacks the panache of the satged version. In the movie, the classical numbers by Kander and Ebb are turned into slinky and choreographed squences graced by the passable vocals of Renee Zwellger and the irrespressible Catherine Zeta Jones. She has indeed done justice to the demanding numbers especially All That Jazz. Props also go out to Queen Latifah for her performance in the movie as well as her rendition of Mama.<br /><br />The icing on the cake here are the songs Class (which was removed from the final cut of the movie) and the Oscar nominated new song I Move On written by Kander and Ebb and performed by Jones and Zwelleger. However, all is not yet perfect as the last 2 songs on the soundtrack break the mood set out by this largely Broadway-sounding CD. The rap remix of Tango is asolutely yucky and Anastacia's Love Is A Crime is really a crime!<br /><br />Overall, the soundtrack is mostly listenable if you skip the last two.
006016848X|3.0|After reading this book I felt that I had learned a lot. There are a lot of really insightful observations and helpful hints on how to communicate more effectively. <br />One thing that annoyed me about the book though was how it avoided talking about some subjects or sugar coated them. It falls back on the old \\"women need to talk about their problems and men shouldn't offer solutions\\" logic. It avoids issues like women's expression of anger and instead tries to insist that women are not \\"blaming\\" men, they are just expressing themselves. Anyeone who has had a wife return home from work after a bad day knows that the last thing she wants is a shoulder to cry on, she is looking for someone to vent on. My kids are treated horribly when my wife's employer is hard on her. I guess this kind of subject is still too taboo to touch.
0316666343|5.0|Always compelling and lyrical, The Lovely Bones deserves to be remembered fondly as its narrator is remembered by those she leaves behind.  This is a serial-killer novel for those who don't like serial-killer novels, removing the lurid and sexy sheen most novelists lend their killers and replacing it with pity and honesty.  The grace, smarts and emphasis belong to the victims in this story, and as the novel unfolds and you want to cry out for justice, there is no immediate gratification, no hero with iron-clad evidence, but a girl frozen in time yearning for the life she's been denied, trying to help her loved ones reach the Heaven they can create on Earth.  It deserves all the praise it has received.
0316666343|4.0|This was a good read with a truly unique perspective. Some of the characters needed more work - Mr.Harvey and Susie's mother. I was a little disappointed with the ending as well, the beginning of the novel leads you to believe that the murderer will be caught eventually as people find the &quot;clues&quot; that Susie left behind. The closure that Susie gets in the end wasn't the type of closure I was hoping for. The rest of the novel is a wonderful tale of grief and moving on.
B000070WJE|5.0|Very good album, just be aware that it is &quot;Copy Controlled&quot; as described on the cover. This means no ripping to mp3 for your portable mp3 player or backup. That is not to say that it can't be ripped, the copy protection just tries to mess things up in a standard windows CD-ROM driver. Hint... try ripping in a DVD RAM drive... and ipod away you go...
B00006LLNV|5.0|I suppose that I've given myself away with that title. This is an amazing collection of artists and music. The original music by Elliot Goldenthal is so fantastic. My favorite track is Paloma Negra...Chavela Vargas is heartwrenching in this sad but lovely song that completely represents Frida's love for Diego. As for Elliot Goldenthals explanation of Mexican music...&quot;Mexican music can not be generalised...there is a  certain harmonic fingerprint..and a proud avoidance of over-complex harmonies. Song is everywhere in Mexico, you sing and are sung to and you are expected to sing. Mexico is singing.&quot; He has hit it right on the money and I agree with him completely. Bravo to everyone involved in this film for their integrity with the Mexican history and the tragic tale of Frida Kahlo..in the telling via film and music.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Yes, it is true. The Beatles Anthology is THE VERY BEST DVD release of all time. There is no question about this one; it truly deserves to belong in every DVD and Beatles home library. The picture is the best I have ever seen (only slightly better than the laserdisc version, and far superior to the VHS issue); sound quality is, undoubtedly, the finest there has ever been. The packaging perfectly compliments the discs which are contained inside. With this variation of the Anthology series, now available, people who have seen it can now see it in a whole new light. And for those folks that have not witnessed it as of yet, then they are in for a real treat. Of course; this review comes from a screening of the DVD that I only borrowed. I, myself, do NOT currently own my own copy of this program in this format, just yet. I only have it on both VHS and laserdisc. By owning it on DVD will help to make this collection complete!
B00006RIO7|4.0|Love listening to the soundtrack while driving! I saw this Broadway revival live in 1996, and was jumping up and down when I discovered that a film version was being made! This was a FABUOLOUS rendition of a broadway musical, Gere, Zellweger, and Zeta-Jones were tops and I have a much deeper appreciation for all three of them than prior to seeing this movie-musical. The only thing I would like to see different is the two last tracks of the CD. I don't understand why they had to be on there. I love Queen Latifah as much as the next person, but her rap version of &quot;He had it comin'&quot; with Little Kim was too much. It is so far removed from the tone of the soundtrack that it offends my ears every time it starts. Anastacia's &quot;Love is a Crime&quot; could have been done without as well. Danny Elfman once again comes through and blows everything out of the water with his contributions to the score. Overall, I love this CD and it will never go in my &quot;trade&quot; pile.
B00007LL7O|2.0|I have been listening to Stratovarius's previous releases for about a year now and I must say, they have lost me as a fan!  Talent and musically speaking, they're one of the best power metal bands in existence, but lyrically they're lacking!  Ones philisophical and religious beliefs is his/her own choice. In the future I would recommend keeping their own views on Christ and God out of their music, and move forward with other lyrical content.  There are many more subjects to write lyrics about other than what God hasn't done for me.  What have your done for God?
0446608955|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because I thought it was really good. It is deffently a book you can't put down or even stop wanting to feel tears in your eyes. <BR>  This book is about a teenage girl named Jamie Silivan in her senior year at high school. Jamie is a very freindly girl and loves spending time with the orphans. She carries a bible around with her every where she goes. People make fun of Jamie behind her back. Then there's a teenage boy named Landon who is a popular one at school and also makes fun of Jamie. Well They both are in a play together. Landon Dosen't want to be in this play but Jamie helps with his lines. Landon falls i n love with her but then there's something else that falls right between their love.<BR>   I would deffentily recomend this book to any girl and not so much a boy because its more of a love story than an action kind of book. It was really good. This book was wrote by Nicholas Sparks. Very good auotor. All of his books were awsome.
B00005JKG9|5.0|I have never been a fan of Jack Lemmon with the single exception of his stellar performance in the 1955 western \\"Cowboy\\" opposite Glen Ford. However, in \\"Glengarry Glen Ross,\\" Mr. Lemmon's talent shines forth like a supernova. To critics of the film who say real businessmen don't behave this way, I beg to differ. Maybe not in front of customers, visitors or women -- but I speak from over 35 years in the sales field (5 years of it in real estate) when I say that behind closed doors the events portrayed in this film are not as farfetched as the public would suppose. That the events in the film are larger than life, yes; condensed in time, yes. But very real.<br />The credo of most sales organizations in hiring salespeople is this: \\"If you throw enough s--t on the wall, some of it is going to stick.\\" Maybe they don't use those same words, but the intent is the same. Sad but true.<br />So, if you want to have your spirits fluffed up, buy a Disney DVD. If you want to enjoy a fine, well-written drama with an outstanding cast -- buy, rent or swindle a copy of \\"Glengarry Glen Ross. I recommend it both for closers and losers.
0345339738|3.0|This is the third book in the Lord of the Rings series.  It tells how the ring is destroyed, and answers a lot of questions that you may have had in your head from the first two books.  It really had only a few interesting parts.  It is a drag between the cool parts.  They talk about things that already happened in the other books.  And it is confusing.  In the second half, they talk about things that happened in the first half, and say they have not yet happened.  You will like this if you want to find the ending of the Lord of the Rings, but otherwise, probably not.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam is one of the best best bands of the ninetys. And this album sure shows their enormous talent. It's PERFECT. Every song is good. From &quot;Once&quot; to &quot;Release&quot;. A total winner in every category. Great music. Strong songwriting. It all comes together perfectly. Ed Vedder and Mike McCready are geniouses. Vedder has a strong voice and vocal range, and McCready (Check out him jamming live with Long Beach Shortbus on the Long Beach Records comp. album &quot;When Punkers Were Punk....&quot;) and Stone Gossard are awesome guitarists. Now on to the tracks...&quot;Once&quot; is my favorite track on the album, and it gets it off to a great start. It's fast, rockin', and has a really cool guitar riff in it. &quot;Evenflow&quot; is an excellent song that will keep you singing it for days even if you can't understand what Vedder is saying the first time you hear it. &quot;Alive&quot; is a Pearl Jam favorite, and an incredibly anthemic song. &quot;Why Go?&quot; is another great rockin' song, with a great chorus. &quot;Black&quot; is the most powerful Pearl Jam song ever written. This is an example of a perfect song. The ending to the song is especially good, with Vedder howling and a piano playing in the backround. &quot;Jeremy&quot; is a song which truly showcases Vedder's writing talents. It sends chills down my spine as well. &quot;Porch&quot; is another one of my favorite songs here, it just plain ROCKS. &quot;Oceans&quot; is a slower song, but slower doesn't mean worse. &quot;Garden&quot; is a VERY haunting song. Vedder's howl makes chills run down your spine every time you listen to it. &quot;Deep&quot; is a straight up rock song with very good lyrics as well. &quot;Release&quot; is the only track I don't really care for. It's too mellow for me. Do as I say! Buy this album! You will not be dissapointed!
B000007T1M|5.0|This is Much better than the 2nd. My favorite songs are \\"Know\\" and \\"Peephole\\"
0140157352|5.0|Excellent book!  Methods discussed can be easily used in the real world!
B00000IQW5|4.0|This is a remake of a classic Spencer Tracy film. Speilberg admits that &quot; A Guy named Joe&quot; was one of his favorite movies. So like most people who , if given the oppurtunity pay tribute to such things in their life. He did it thru his genre, a remake. This movie is slow in spots but overall has wonderful moments. I think if the critics would ever just go to the movies to be entertained, this movie would have received much better reviews.<BR>I will not go to deep into the film, only to say it does have good acting and terrific scenes, especially if you want to make a girl &quot;go weak in the knees&quot;<BR>This film makes you both shout and cry, and I can't help but think , if you watch it, just for the joy of watching a movie, you will not be disappointed.<BR>I throughly enjoyed this film the first time I saw it and everytime after. But don't take my word for it, rent it today, and I think you may just come back and buy it for your collection.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I won't repeat the other reviewer comments here, but this is what this movie meant for me:<br />It's a story of two lives, Forrest Gump's and Jenny's. Forrest's life despite his shortcomings lead to nothing short of spectacular meetings, events, and coincidences that mark our history.  Jenny's life is more painful, full of soul searching and bitterness. <br />Jenny doesn't love Forrest the way he loves her, but in the end, she gives him the greatest love that any women can give a man, her son.<br />This movie is also about unconditional love, Forrest being a simple being, doesn't carry the preconceptions that normal adults have. He is not bothered that his friend Bubba is black, or his friend Captain Dan is crippled, or his girlfriend was abused. He IS SIMPLE, he loves and he cares, unconditionally. Other adults grow up to question things, try to analyze everything, why war? why not war? etc. <br />And yet, it is Forrest's simple being that coincidentally leads him to fortune, meetings with presidents, athletic achievemenets, the sort of things that all adults covet.(how ironic)<br />Forrest Gump just IS, a simple minded person able to love and give love. Forrest does not judge, evaluate, or analyze people or  situations, to him it just IS, and he just makes the best of it. Shouldn't that be an important lesson for all us grown - ups?<BR>&quot;Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get.&quot;<br />Like Forrest said at the foot of the staircase, after asking Jenny to marry him.....  &quot;I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is...&quot;    WOW! go see the movie!
B00005JLRR|4.0|A fantastic farewell to TNG gang! Data you will be missed! Although not as good as First Contact, this movie will hold up well in the annuls of Star Trek.<BR>2 issues, though: 1) The Remuns looked too much like Orcs and the 'fly through' of the mines on Remus too much like Isengard; and 2) Shinzon looked a dead ringer for Dr. Evil (... any moment I half expected him to ask Picard to \\"throw me a frickin' bone here!\\".<BR>Top Flick!
B0000026JR|5.0|Riot's Thundersteel doesn't get the acclaim it deserves. It takes a lot of their Rainbow influenced sound, and combines it with Thrash and Judas Priest influences to come up with something that was in its beginning stages: power metal. And speaking of &quot;Power Metal&quot;, Pantera's album of the same name has many similarites to this. They are both worth the effort tracking down. Awesome double bass drums, blazing speed riffs, amazing appregios and Halford type screams await the listener. Its obvious where bands like Hammerfall and (especially) Nocturnal Rites get a lot of their inspiration. This album stands the test of time, and predicted alot of the trademarks of nineties power metal as well. Buy it immediately!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave had an extremely hard task in delivering this album. Many questioned if it would live up to previous work with soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine. Not only did they deliver but the album surpassed both of the former bands. Musically the boys have developed and take it up a notch. With Cornnell's pure alpha male vocals and Morello's wining guitar solos, this really is a must buy album. Impossible to stress how good this album is, it is welcomed releif from the  nonense of nu-metal and 'punk pop' which has come to dominate rock music. BUY IT
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie was an amazing movie. The entire theatre jumped and cheered in awe of certain \\"gunkata\\" scenes. The story of the movie was an adaptation of some old classic movie scripts and books but in a very original way. They seemed to be working under a tight budget for scenery but it just added to the cold hard feeling of the set. Also what may at first seem like to be a hole in the movies plot turns out to have been a clue to the real situation. This movie is definetly worth owning and make sure you show it to everyone you have over because unless you tell them they probably will never even know of it's existence. This movie got no commercial marketing at all. Once you see it you will want everyone to see it so you can agree on how good it was.
B00005YW4H|4.0|norah jones seems to be sparking some controversy with her debut album 'come away with me.' The first time i heard her on late night t.v. i was very impressed with her smooth jazz style...not to mention her looks. i have read a few negative reviews about her, and i disagree with the comments of 'just another person jumping on the bandwagon' of the rejuvinated jazz scene. the album offers a relaxing, very slow-paced, even romantic feel to it. Now all the harsh critics who are not giving her a chance, i ask you to reconsider. Bare in mind, this is ms. jones' first album, and the potential is there for her to become a great musicain. i agree, she is not reached greatness yet, but her jazz roots and mellow voice will prevail over time. Trust me.
B000088E6M|5.0|YEAH THIS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR FOR THE RAP GAME I BELIEVE HE BRINGS IT BACK TO THE STREET LEVEL WITH MAJOR PROMO OF COURSE AND TOP PRODUCERS ALL IN ALL IT IS A VERY HOT ALBUM....<BR>AND IF YOU LIKE 50 YOU WILL LOVE OUR TOP ARTIST YOUNG KRIME aka DA GHETTO BABY                               <br />IS WHERE YOU CAN LEARN MORE...
B000050FEN|5.0|Buy this one; you'll have to watch it over and over. Brad Pitt is awesome he really acted well in this film. Morgan Friedman is sensational in this film he really made the film. The movie is old, I know, but I just re-watched it and I have to say that it was just as good as the first time, buy it!
B00007H1Y2|5.0|I don't even need to think about buying a cooder disk when it comes out......he always puts out something worth listening to.  this release is no exception, in fact this is amazing! I literally put this cd on 80 minutes ago and am on my second back to back listen (which is quite rare).  While instrumental, there is so much going on....very well recorded and a blast to listen to.  If you haven't listened to much Ry Cooder, then be excited, because an endless catalog of amazing, and very diverse, music is out there for you.  You should definitely check out \\"A Meeting by the River.\\" I am especially enjoying this disc at the moment because it is bringing much needed sunshine into this dreary northeast winter we are having.  give me a margharitta, a beach chair, and endless blue ocean....and this.  Perfect!
B00005JLF5|5.0|Even though all the previous  'STAR TREK' series were filmed in color, their stories were, for the most part, BLACK&WHITE..... And then came DS9, a study of Gene Roddenberry's universe in complex shades of gray. With thought provoking episodes like 'The Darkness and the Light', in which Kira is forced to confront the consequences of her actions as a member of the Bajorian resistance (considered a terrorist group by the Cardassians), and 'In the Pale Moonlight', where Sisco finds himself an unwitting accomplice in the assassination  of a Romulan Senator and then an active participant in it's cover-up, DS9 will challenge as well as entertain you.
B000023X9W|5.0|Lord knows Neil has had no shortage of acoustic songs and albums throughout his career, but none sound like or bear anything but a superficial resemblance to Silver and Gold.  Whereas albums like After the Gold Rush and Harvest had a yearning, desperate feel; Comes a Time a wistful aceeptance of life's challenges, here Neil sounds like he's perfectly in the moment - contented to be where and who he is, and joyed to be doing it with the people he's with (I mean his family here, not the instrumentalists on this album).<br />Some songs are standouts, all of them are wonderful. The album is performed in a laid-back, homedown manner, as if Neil had simply got his family together in the living room, got the fireplace going, made sure there were enough marshmallows for the hot chocolate, and simply got out his acoustic and played these songs for his loved ones.<br />I really recommend this album quite highly.  To say &quot;it ranks this high or that high&quot; in his catalog is really inaccurate and unrepresentative.  And I don't know if it's fair to say &quot;if you like Tonight's the Night, but not Harvest Moon, then this won't do it for you&quot; or &quot;If you're a fan of Comes A Time, you'll like this&quot;.  To me, this is a collection by a master songwriter not trying to impress anyone, just writing and performing songs, as he says in Buffalo Springfield Again, &quot;for the fun of it&quot;. <br />Should you get this album?  That depends.  Do you like music?
B00000099Y|5.0|Looking back, I have realized that each Tool album has its own distinct personality. Undertow was a steady stream of high quality metal songs, Aenima is creepy and experimantal (also the harshest of the Tool albums), and Lateralus was lighter, longer, and more artsy. Aenima is my favorite. Not every song on it is perfect and it may not even have as many good songs as Undertow, but it is the experience as a whole that defines it. It has three or four GREAT songs, a bunch of solid supporting songs, a couple filler songs that sound a little too similar, and a few tracks that are not really songs, but creepy mood setters. As for the great songs, \\"Stinkfist,\\" \\"Eulogy,\\" \\"Hooker With a Penis,\\" and \\"Aenima,\\" are all Tool classics. Another much less popular but strangely entertaining track is \\"Intermission\\" which is basically carnival music, but it adds to the uniqueness of the album. Aenima is often creepy, sometimes downright disturbing, but it sure packs some amazing power.
B000002TQV|5.0|...I and my friends sipped in the beauty this album has to offer.<br />Aside from the singles which everyone has heard, this album boasts such classic Radiohead gems as Street Spirit[Fade Out], Black Star, Bulletproof, and Nice Dreams.  These recording sessions were the precursors to the devastating OK computer.  Those of you who did not have a copy of this album the day it came out probably got into Radiohead at or after OK computer so you may not have heard their full progression into the avant guard musical geniuses they are today.  This album encapsulates their struggle to find their true sound in the face of label demands for catchy tunes.  The result is full of brilliant tracks successfully accessible to many not comfortable with music that does not conform to the common taste.
B00006JMTR|3.0|This is pretty much a vehicle to show off Bo Derek, and it accomplishes that.  As an added bonus, there's Olivia d'abo in a nice bathing scene......if you're a fan of either of them then the VHS is worthwile, if not - get something modern, you heathen :-)
B00005QXXO|5.0|This band has always delivered outstanding material in the studio yet If you haven't gotten the chance to see them live you might ponder their capabilities as a touring band.  This album will have you crossing your fingers for another tour to be announced.  The 'Like Spinning Plates' is phenomenal although I've heard there was a superior performance to this during the tour.  'True Love Waits' is a track that may be new to some Radiohead listeners and is also masterfully done with passion and sadness that weeps from the speakers.  Radiohead proves that they are not just architects, they also pour their hearts out on stage and give every show as much attention as they do the laborious task of bottling their musical energies into album form.  This compilation from their KID A sessions tour boasts everything a Radiohead fan could ask for from frantic seizures of antipathy to soul-chilling tapestries of forlornment.
B000002K9N|2.0|Disclaimers: I *may* be one of the biggest Sinatra fans around.  I have not only everything he ever recorded, but (in some cases) several copies of it, released on different media in different times.  I truly believe he is the greatest singer who ever lived.<br />Frank was a perfectionist in the studio, often doing 10 or more takes of a song even after looping and multitrack recordings made them unnecessary.  His dedication in the studio make his studio recordings among the most amazing audio disks you can own.<br />But this album is only for die hard Sinatra fans, or for those stuck in some kind of 60's timewarp.  Frank has sung all of these songs *much* better on his studio albums, with the only exception of \\"The Shadow of Your Smile\\" (only available here -- he never recorded a studio version).  It's a good version of that song, although he changes the lyrics (a Frank trademark) so we don't hear the haunting \\"and all the joy that love can bring\\" but \\"and every little lovely thing\\" instead, but that and his dialog (\\"Tea time\\", a kind of mock humble discussion about his age and career which is most memorable for showing that when Frank tried to be funny the best he could do was to do a pale imitation of his best bud, Dean Martin -- it's eerie to hear how hard he tried to emulate the one man that Frank truly looked up to) aren't enough to justify the price of this album.<br />If you *must* have a live Sinatra album this is probably the one, but if you don't have them already you'd be much better served buying \\"Ring a ding ding\\", \\"Sinatra-Basie\\", and the superb \\"Robin and the 7 Hoods\\" soundtrack.  These cover much the same ground with *much* superior singing.  Come back to this one only after your Reprise collection is complete (after, of course, you've first completed your Capitol collection, but that's a whole other story...)
B000003TAB|5.0|This was nirvana's unheard of album. I was amazed at the first time I heard it. Incesticide introduced me to punk rock.  The first 3 songs are amazing.  The first song Dive, makes you want to dive into him because kurt is begging you to and forcing you to sing with him.  Sliver was in my opinion Nirvana's popiest song. I find myself singing it over and over again even though I have not played the album in weeks, because I fear that I'm going to play the album out of listening comprehension. Stain is a favorite of mine because of the lyrics, hearing him sing &quot;I'm a stain&quot; makes me feel like im not the only waste of space in this world. The album loses it's edge for a while in the middle. Nirvana does their cover of the vaselines and then does a new wave version of Polly which is much faster and better than their previous effort on Nevermind.  The songs start to drift into grunge and the lyrics get better.  Big Long Now was a heavy song, it was my favorite during the first time i listened to it, until I reached Aneurysm. Aneurysm is my favorite hardcore song. Although most wouldn't consider it to be hardcore because it isn't a repetitive, generate, punk song.This was the song that blew me away and I am still moved with each listen. Incesticide was my favorite album, it would still be my favoritealbum even if Dive, Sliver and Aneurysm were the only songs on it.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I've been waiting for Christina Aguilera's second 'real' album.I have to buy it again,  because I have a fake cd, it has no fold outs.But anyways, this CD is worth purchasing. It it much more mature then her previous CD and hits like \\"Genie, What a girl wants, come on over..evt.\\" Which are also good.Her new tracks have more emotion and feeling in them, like her smash hit \\"Beautiful,\\" amazing song, it's gonna win a grammy but the video [is bad].\\"Dirrty\\" totally does not represent the album in any way, but it's not that bad of a track, you can get used to it.\\"Walk Away\\" is one of my favorites, it's a great r&b-ish ballad with great lyrics. She should make a remix of \\"Can't hold us Down\\" with Lil'KiM, Kim can rap better theen that, seriously it's a cool track,fine beats my RockWilder.\\"Fighter\\" is good strong-rock track which could have been a bit better, it could do could as a single.\\"Impossible\\" is a very nice piano upbeat ballad,created almost all by the wonderful Alicia Keys.\\"Infaution\\" is also a nice r&b-danceble beat track.Aguilera's voice seems stronger than before and she went pretty far this time with herself musically as an artist. (...)But overall a very great album, wonderful voice, tracks and lyrics.It'll score good. Buy it, now.tter and compensate in comparisson to her debut.
B000084T18|5.0|This cd is hot, go cop it.
B00005JL95|5.0|I didn't even want to see this movie when it came out in theaters.  I watched it recently out of boredom and have been Stitch obsessed ever since.  This movie is so touching and cute.  Do yourself a favor and see this movie.  It's got something for everyone.  I am not the same person since I've seen it :)
B00006CXXU|4.0|i must admit, i bought this cd with a fair amount of trepidation. i don't like christina's first few singles, and she didn't do herself any favours with the 'dirrty' video. but i would advise anyone else feeling the same to put their doubts to one side, cos this is a top-notch cd.<BR>there is a noticeable lack of bubblegum pop, thankfully, although aguilera has not escaped it completely - 'a voice within' is a power ballad reminiscent of mariah carey. but she does show her versitality, and ability to carry off different styles. 'fighter', a standout track is rock; 'walk away' and 'impossible' are soul; 'can't hold us down' and 'dirrty' are close to rnb. <BR>aguilera's impressive vocals are perhaps showcased best on 'i'm ok', in which she talks about her abusive father. there are few vocal gymnastics and hardly any ad-libbing, but her raw voice is still enough to give you goosebumps, thanks to the lyrics. 'keep on singing my song' which is close to gospel is an effective way to finish the album, especially following 'i'm ok'. <BR>'beautiful' also has to be mentioned; along with 'fighter', 'walk away' and 'i'm ok' it is the best track on the album - touching and powerful.<BR>before i got this album i viewed christina as a somewhat desperate artist mroe famous for her (lack of) clothes than her talent. but 'stripped' shows her to be a talented singer and songwriter. she has earned some credibility thru collaborations with alicia keys, lil kim, a member of the foo fighters (can't remember his name) and linda perry. as she continues to release singles off this album ('dirrty' is to be followed by 'beautiful' and then 'impossible') she will be able to win more people's respect.
B000065FWW|5.0|We got this movie years ago and we love it.  It has a wizard, magic, hobbit-style, adventure theme.  It has monsters and humor.  Just an all-around good movie.
B00005JLWN|5.0|It is truely sad that Demension films basicly droped this film.  If it had recieved wide scale advertisement i believe it would have been a great success at the box office.  This is a Sci-Fi adventure that rivals the classics.  This movie is not only a marvel of action but of the true depths of the soul as well.  A truely great movie and one of my all time favorite films.
0784011680|1.0|Chaplin was one of the funniest, most creative men to have ever lived. Robert Downey Jr. is not. Somehow great Chaplin scenes are recreated without being even slightly funny. Attenbourogh is so fixated on literary cinematic methods (such as foreshadowing: at the start Chaplin is removing his makeup...a metaphor for stripping away the mask) that he forgets to make the story funny or tragic.<BR>I was very disappointed at the short shrift given to Stan Laurel in the story. He and Chaplin were friends and partners for years, but it is not even obvious who \\"Stan\\" is in his one miserable scene. Skip this one.
B000060P79|1.0|probably the most poppy band i have ever come across upon.

0151006903|5.0|Set in 1204 in the kingdom of Byzantine, this tells of Baudolino, who saves several from death at the hands of crusading warriors through Constantinople, and whose gifts for learning languages and telling tall tales earns him a journey in search of a legendary priest-king in a mysterious land. A fine story of change and discovery set against a believable historical backdrop.
B00004R9A4|3.0|Seven years following the highly successful 1964 film \\"Mary Poppins\\", Walt Disney Pictures attempted to capitalize again on its highly successful formula by releasing the 1971 film entitled \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\".  Starring Angela Lansury in the title role of Eglantine Price (very similar to Julie Andrews' role as Mary Poppins), the plot of the film places the care of three young children (instead of two as in \\"Mary Poppins\\") in her very capable, but inexperienced hands during Germany's bombings of London of World War II.  Like Mary Poppins, Eglantine is very magical, being an apprentice witch who is learning witchcraft secretly via a correspondence course as part of her desire to assist England's war effort.  Unlike Mary Poppins (who focuses her efforts on taking care of children in dysfunctional families), Eglantine has no previous experience taking care of children, nor was it one of her goals in life.  However, the continuous bombings of London during World War II forced the British authorities to evacuate the children to, essentially, foster homes well outside of London where they would be much safer. <br />The three children thrust upon Eglantine to take of are from the same family: Charlie Rawlins (Ian Weighill), Paul Rawlins (Roy Snart) and Carrie Rawlins (Cindy O'Callaghan). Charlie, the oldest, has the attitude \\"I don't want to do anything\\", and becomes quite annoying sometimes.  Paul and Carrie are much friendlier.  Upon moving in with Eglantine, the trio quickly discovers that she is a witch, but that her spells normally don't last very long.  Unfortunately, the correspondence school goes out of business just before Eglantine is to receive the most important spell.  Determined to get the spell, Eglantine decides that she must find the school's headmaster, Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson, who played George Banks in \\"Mary Poppins\\").  Having no standard transportation capable of going to London, Eglantine casts a \\"travelling spell\\" upon a bedknob in Paul's possession, turning his bed into an equivalent \\"flying carpet\\".  Using the magical bed, the four are transported to Emelius Browne in London. Sadly, Emelius doesn't have the final spell, so the five go to great lengths to find it, including traveling to an animated world which is reminiscent to the walk through the chalk painting in \\"Mary Poppins\\".<br />The first quarter of \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" is quite good, as is the final quarter of the film.  Unfortunately, the middle half of the film drags considerably as the five search for the crucial spell.  Small children will likely be captivated by the myriad songs, dance and animation through the middle half, but there is little substance to maintain the interest of adults and its scenes contribute little towards the plot.  The special effects used in the final quarter of the film won \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.  The film also received Oscar nominations for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Original Musical Score and Best Song.  Angela Lansbury received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy.<br />The songs include:<br />* \\"The Old Home Guard\\" (4/5, male studio chorus).<BR>* \\"A Step In The Right Direction\\" (5/5, Angela Lansbury). Sung by Eglantine to the children.<BR>* \\"The Age of Not Believing\\" (5/5, Angela Lansbury). The song that received an Oscar nomination for Best Song.<br />* \\"With a Flair\\" (4.5/5, David Tomlinson). A funny song for a street vendor.<BR>* \\"Eglantine\\" (4/5, David Tomlinson & Angela Lansbury). A love song by Emelius towards Eglantine.<BR>* \\"Portobello Road\\" (2.5/5, primarily David Tomlinson). A visit to Portobello Road in search of an ancient book turns into a lengthy, repetitive and exhausting song contributing nothing to the plot.<BR>* \\"Portobello Street Dance\\" (2/5, street dance). A superfluous continuation of the previous song for dancers of various nationalities under British rule.  (Imagine an Energizer Bunny commercial lasting for 10 minutes nonstop.)<BR>* \\"The Beautiful Briny\\" (3/5, David Tomlinson & Angela Lansbury). A forgettable song sung in an animated underwater environment.<BR>* \\"Substitutiary Locomotion\\" (5/5, Angela Lansbury, David Tomlinson, Ian Weighill, Cindy O'Callaghan, and Roy Snart). Eglantine's crucial spell used by her to lead a magical army of empty armored knights into battle against a ficticious Nazi invasion on the British coastline.<BR>* \\"Nobody's Problems\\" (3.5/5, Angela Lansbury).  Restored to the film in 1996.<BR>* \\"Finale (Reprise of 'The Old Home Guard')\\" (4/5, male studio chorus).<br />Comparing the cut film with the restored 139-minute film, I believe the previously cut material should have been made optional on the DVD for viewing as none of the restored scenes actually contribute to the plot. Further, some of the restored scenes are in very poor quality as compared to the rest of the film.<br />\\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" is still an entertaining film for both children and adults alike, but the unnecessary plot deviations dominating much of the film force me to rate this restored version with only 3 stars out of 5.  Rather than attempting to repeat the success of \\"Mary Poppins\\" by using a similar formula, the writers of \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" could have done more by exploring Eglantine's magical abilities and the lives of the children prior to moving in with Eglantine.  If you have small children, I would highly recommend purchasing a copy of the film; but if you don't have any small children, you may be happier renting a copy.
B000002P5W|5.0|Jimi created his own axis, and he gives us a glimpse with <BR>&quot;Axis: Bold As Love.&quot;<br />This is my favorite Jimi jam (and believe me, I've had more than my share of &quot;Axis&quot; vs. &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; arguments!  Maybe I'll tell y'all about a classic debate I had with an employee at J&amp;R Music in Lower Manhattan one day!) because it showcases the whole spectrum of his genius...Songwriting, playing, singing and production. <br />Everyone goes on and on about how Miles started Fusion, well, I'm here to say that Jimi had that concept down by the time Mr. Davis decided to plug his horn into a Wah-Wah pedal with the &quot;Axis&quot; cuts, &quot;Up From The Skies,&quot; &quot;Gold And Rose&quot; and &quot;If Six Was Nine.&quot;  (Need I mention even earlier Fusion cuts on &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot;)<br />I have only one problem with &quot;Axis,&quot; and it pertains to Jimi's ending solo on the title cut.  The phasing effects make an otherwise uninspired solo sound stratospheric. It leaves me torn each time I hear it. (maybe that was the effect Jimi and studio engineer Eddie Kramer were shooting for.)
6305878323|5.0|In 1964, Walt Disney Pictures, under the directorship of Robert Stevenson, released what became a timeless, musical, fantasy called \\"Mary Poppins\\".  Starring Julie Andrews as the mysterious & magical Mary Poppins, the film is a fictional account of a dysfunctional family living in London circa 1910.  The father, George W. Banks (David Tomlinson, who played Emelius Browne in \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" in 1971), is obsessed with his job at a prestigious Fidelity Fiduciary Bank and with maintaining a professional atmosphere at all times at home.  The mother, Winifred Banks (Glynis Johns, whose film career began in 1938), is preoccupied with demonstrating as a suffragette and maintaining a clean home.  Their young children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber, who died at the young age of 21 in 1977), are allowed minimal time with their parents, who prefer to have a nanny look after and raise their children for them.  Unfortunately, Jane and Michael rarely like any of their nannies, who regularly quit after the children do something mischievous to each of them.  Also working for Mr. & Mrs. Banks are the maid Ellen (Hermione Baddeley, who played Mrs. Cratchit in the 1951 classic \\"Scrooge\\") and the cook Mrs. Brill (Reta Shaw, who played in \\"Pollyanna\\" in 1960 and \\"The Ghost & Mr. Chicken\\" in 1966), neither of which have the time or the desire to look after Jane and Michael.<br />Following the departure of yet another nanny, George decides to hire an appropriate nanny himself.  Jane and Michael write their own advertisement for a nanny, but George regards their innocent description as rubbish as he intends to find a nanny that will uphold his every professional expectation.  Mysteriously, the children's advertisement, that George tossed out, comes to Mary Poppins.  When a very lengthy line of perspective nannies are seen at the Banks' front door early one morning, all of them are blown away by a strong wind.  Coming down from the sky via an umbrella is the magical Mary Poppins.  Expecting a rush of perspective nannies to race through the door, only Mary Poppins waits to enter the Banks' home.  George interviews Mary, but he is quickly confused by her wit and unexpectedly hires her.  From that point on, nothing is quite the same in the Banks home and the children get a nanny that not only fulfills their expectations, but becomes something much more to them.  Along the way, the children are also introduced to several interesting people, including the handyman Bert (Dick Van Dyke, who starred in his own 1961 TV show and starred in \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\"), Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn, who also played the toy-maker in \\"Babes in Toyland\\" in 1961) and the bird woman (Jane Darwell).<br />Many of the songs in the film are well known by people who have never seen the film, including:<br />* \\"Sister Suffragette\\" (4.5/5, Glynis John).  Winifred calling for the rights of women to be able to vote.<BR>* \\"The Life I Lead\\" (5/5, David Tomlinson).  George describing his life and what a British home should be.<BR>* \\"The Perfect Nanny\\" (4.5/5, Karen Dotrice & Matthew Garber).  Jane & Michael telling what they want in a nanny to their parents.<BR>* \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\" (5/5, Julie Andrews).  Mary encouraging the children to clean their rooms upon her arrival.<BR>* \\"Pavement Artist (Chim-Chim-Cheree)\\" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert's carefree life.<BR>* \\"Jolly Holiday\\" (4.5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert describing how wonderful it is to be with Mary Poppins again within the sidewalk chalk painting.<BR>* \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" (5+/5, Julie Andrews & Dick Van Dyke).  A word you use when you don't know what else to say.<BR>* \\"Stay Awake\\" (5/5, Julie Andrews). A lullaby to Jane and Michael.<BR>* \\"I Love To Laugh\\" (4.5/5, Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Ed Wynn). Uncle Albert is visited who is suffering from incurable laughter.<BR>* \\"A British Bank (The Life I Lead\\") (5/5, David Tomlinson & Julie Andrews). Mary telling George that he'll be taking the children to the bank with him.<BR>* \\"Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)\\" (5/5, Julie Andrews). Mary describing the life of a poor woman who enjoys feeding birds.<BR>* \\"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\\" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke and David Tomlinson) Mr. Dawes Sr. (also played by Dick Van Dyke), the CEO of George's bank, sings praises to the British banking system with George to Jane and Michael.<BR>* \\"Chim-Chim-Cheree\\" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert describing the carefree life of chimney sweep.<BR>* \\"Step in Time\\" (4/5, Dick Van Dyke). Song and dance upon the sooty rooftops of London.<BR>* \\"A Man Has Dreams\\" (4.5/5 Dick Van Dyke and David Tomlinson) George singing his woes to Bert.<BR>* \\"Let's Go Fly a Kite\\" (4.5/5, David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns). George & Winifred spending time with Jane and Michael.<br />It is not surprising that so many children and adults alike love \\"Mary Poppins\\".  It's catchy songs and fantastic situations propel the audience into a magical world of laughter and love that can be watched many times while never becoming tiresome.  It also made Julie Andrews a household name with her unforgettable performance as Mary Poppins.  Julie Andrews went on to play leading roles in \\"The Americanization of Emily\\" (1964), \\"The Sound of Music\\" (1965), \\"10\\" (1979) and \\"Victor/Victoria\\" (1982).<br />I highly recommend the purchase of \\"Mary Poppins\\" on DVD, where it can be fully appreciated in its widescreen format.  I rate this DVD with 5 out of 5 stars.

0316096199|5.0|That's how I describe the first chapter to everyone.  The author goes into detail about her rape.....and you can not put it down!  I loved this book even if it was at times difficult to read because of all the heartache!  It is a beautiful story about dispair and the strength it takes to overcome a brutal rape.  It is about hope and what you can become if you put your mind to it.
B000002JSP|5.0|Substance.This album has it in spades.<br />This was the first Zep album I had ever heard --- long after JB's untimely death, and although it was many years later, the sense of loss, after fully absorbing this album, was profound to me. <br />Folks who enjoyed the idea of Led Zeppelin as a heavy metal band and not much else will hate this album. Why? Because In Through the Out Door is about growth and change. The quality of musicianship is mindblowing. Plant's vocals show an unbelievable range of emotion and technical prowress. John Paul Jones shines on keyboards and bass. Bonham manages to make the drums a front-line instrument. And it goes without saying that Page pulls off some hot, hot riffs.<br />The overall sound is both very Zep --- in the incredibly diverse abilities and interests into which the group fearlessly forays, as well as the amazing musicianship --- and very unlike what many think of as quintessential Zep (ie; II). It is in this contradiction that the complexity and brilliance lies. This is an incredible album. Buy it. Buy it now.
630157401X|5.0|\\"Raiders\\" is probably the best Indiana Jones, but \\"Crusade\\" is my personal favorite.  Lucas and Spielberg regrouped after the underwhelming \\"Temple of Doom\\" (a little too violent and way too kiddish for Jones) to craft this action great.  Chock full with more Nazis, rousing action sequences, and sarcastic, sometimes tounge-in-cheek humor and noticably more character development than the first two.  And seriously, who better to play Indiana Jones' father than Sean Connery?  He gives a hilarious, and yet, sophisticated performance that does not fail to make me laugh every time.<br />The plot to the movie is Indiana goes on the hunt for his father, after he disappears while working on a project to recover the legendary Holy Grail, the cup of Christ, ect.  Jones himself gets caught up in the intrigue, ending up helping his fathers assitant (Allison Doody) discover more clues to the grails' wherabouts.  Indy eventually learns that his father was captured by Nazis, and that they are planning to make their armies immortal by using the grails' power.<br />The movie then really picks up, with Indy and father on the run from a ruthless Nazi Colonel (Michael Byrne) on a mission to find the grail before the Nazis do.  On the way, they are spectacular action sequences, including a tank chase scene through the desert, a boat chase through Venice and car chase through rural Germany.  And with Spielberg behind the camera and his sharp eye for that perfect shot of Indy thrawting another Nazi, well, give me one valid reason not to watch time and again.
B000066NW0|5.0|Precocious talent shows through in her lyrics, voice, and composition. A superstar in the making, and definitely one to watch among the Generation X musicmakers.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Although Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness was more ambitious and diverse, Siamese Dream is arguably the best album in the Smashing Pumpkins catalog.<br /><br />In 1993, the Smashing Pumpkins were probably one of the most original bands of the alternative scene. With incredible soundscapes of guitar distortion, Billy Corgan's impassioned and ethereal vocals, and Jimmy Chamberlain's excellent drumming, these guys had a sound that was nothing like any alternative band of the time. Only My Bloody Valentine's Loveless (released in 1991) with its similar guitar-dominated sound could be considered as an influence, but Siamese Dream has its own distinct impact.<br /><br />My, what a sound. Billy Corgan sounds better here than any other Pumpkins album--on later albums he sounded whiny; here he sounds obscure yet not overly shrill. The guitar playing is incredible (listen to the outro of Rocket) and the music grabs you by the collar and takes you in with its sweeping power.<br /><br />Cherub Rock, with its slowly building opening leading to a bombastic arena rocker, is the perfect start to this album. After that, the double hit of Quiet and Today provides immense satisfaction. After Hummer and Rocket pass by leaving their audio imprint on you, the mood takes a sudden turn with the orchestral and haunting ballad Disarm which leads into the soft rock of Soma. The white-hot rage of Geek USA quickly rips through your ears before yielding to two more wonderful ballads--Mayonaise and Spaceboy. After that, the loud and powerful Silverf--k takes over. Finally, the album ends on a whisper with Sweet Sweet and Luna.<br /><br />You won't be tempted to skip through a single track. Although future efforts were more ambitious, the Smashing Pumpkins never made an album this flawless again. You can't lose by adding this one to your collection.<br /><br />..By the way, there's nothing really \\"explicit\\" about the lyrics. Even Silverf--k contains no profanity, except for the barely audible interludes.
B00004T0US|5.0|I have played this CD many times since receiving it. I love it not just because of the selection of songs done in Elvis' grand and endearing style, but because it reveals how Elvis was hurting and expressing himself through his music.<br /> Being a teenager in the fifties, I really took to him and his music. Then I met the love of my life, married, and raised a family. Elvis faded from importance, though I would hear his music and of him. I could not help wondering and feeling sad over how such a talented and beloved entertainer could lose out on life.<br /> Last year when there was much about him because of the 25th anniversary of his death, and maybe because I was lonely, I became interested again. I bought my first CD - ELVIS 30 #1 HITS just to bring back memories. I was immediately hooked again by his great voice and proceeded to buy his 50 GREATEST LOVE SONGS, COUNTRY COLLECTION, PEACE IN THE VALLEY, and THE COMPLETE 50'S MASTERS. I also bought some videos, but something was missing. I wanted to experience some of his final recordings, and MOODY BLUE seemed the answer. For the moment at least, I am fulfilled.<br />Though undeniably sad for me, both because of the way Elvis was feeling and because of my own feelings of loss, I nevertheless love this CD. I am overjoyed that his music is still available to an old fan and thankful his memory lives on in so many hearts through his music. LIVE ON ELVIS till I meet up with you in Heaven where I can hear you sing for Jesus \\"live and in person\\".
B000002IO1|5.0|With a hard rock bluesy guitar that later isn't a bad imitation of early ZZ Top, and a rousing cry in that rough voice of hers, kind of a more refined variation on Joan Jett, Alannah Myles kicks off her debut album with \\"Still Got This Thing For You.\\"<br />That's followed by the second single, \\"Love Is\\", which is punctuated by a throbbing bass and a 80's hard-rock guitar.  Here's how she defines love:  \\"Love is ( love is )/Heaven to the lonely/Show me/What you want me to do/Cause love is/What I got for you\\"<br />The slow bluesy \\"Black Velvet\\", with more of that punctuated bass,  is of course, hands down, the best song here, and the one that topped the charts in 1990.  Who can forget that chorus:  \\"Black velvet and that little boy's smile/Black velvet with that slow southern style/A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees/Black velvet if you please.\\"  There's another lyric that's visually cool:  \\"The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky.\\"  However, don't let naysayers tell you she was a one-hit wonder.  There's more great stuff on this album and on her followup, the more melancholy Rockinghorse.<br />\\"Rock This Joint\\" is the hardest rocking song here even replete with Def Leppard-like backup vocals.  There is a slight nod to \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" while that ZZ Top-like guitar plays.  She wants to rock the joint to the point that, \\"I wanna die with a smile on my face.\\"<br />That is followed by the first ballad and third single, \\"Lover Of Mine\\" which deserved a place in the Top Ten at the very least.  Her voice when smooth, shows she has slow-song talents.  The chorus and guitar at the end puts shifts into minor power ballad mode.<br />The mid-paced \\"Kick Start My Heart\\" has shades of New Jersey-era Bon Jovi, specifically \\"Bad Medicine\\" down to the synthesizer, horns, and guitar.  Not to be confused with the Motley Crue song of the same period, of course.<br />The engaging \\"If You Want To\\" has a rhythm reminiscent of Rod Stewart's \\"Hot Legs\\" but again plays with the Bon Jovi sound and hard-edged guitar.<br />\\"Who Loves You\\" is the other ballad here, mellow in the verses with Ann Wilson vocals before launching into her hard-edged guitar in the chorus.  The blues ditty \\"Hurry Make Love\\" urges her lover to do the title act instead of watching TV.<br />Smoky, hard-edged, bluesy, gentle in ballads, Alannah Myles' eponymous debut deserves revisiting for unique tough and tender female vocalists.

B00005JL7Q|4.0|What do you get when you pair up a worthless trust-fund scion with an ordinary boy of low self-esteem? A hilarious comedy that piercingly dissects family quirks, friendships and relationships. Hugh Grant exudes a cavalier charm as Will who finds himself gravitating to the young Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) in their pretense as father-and-son to impress on his love-interest (Rachel Weisz). Marcus, in the process of avoiding his suicidial-prone mother (Toni Collette) finds Will a surrogate daddy-figure. Their affecting screen chemistry graces the excellent adaptation and direction by Chris and Paul Weitz of American Pie fame. Punctuated with provoking dialogues edged with sarcasm and rapier wits, About A Boy is an earnest comedy of dysfunctional families, dislocated society and humanity that is cuttingly poignant and sharply observant.
B00005QGAT|5.0|<br />This cd is excellent.  The music is upbeat and more importantly there is still an element of \\"funk\\" in Michael's music.  Even his singing is more joyous!  Every dance track will have you wanting to move!  One track that doesn't get enough mention is \\"Get on the Floor.\\"  OUTSTANDING!  Everyone had this album when I was in 4th grade and after taking a second listen to this music I understand why.  <br />The REAL Michael Jackson was a superb \\"R&B\\" artist and not a circus sideshow.  Check this cd out.  No hype.  No \\"explosive\\" videos.  Just Michael's most pleasing album!!
B00002DE2L|5.0|You won't find many recordings of the famed Red Priest's masterpiece that can match this one. I'd put Shaham with the Orpheus CO (also on DG) in the same ballpark, but I know of no recording that reaches the levels of beauty and improvisational flare found on this recording. Anne-Sophie Mutter and the Trondheim soloists have given us a Four Seasons for the ages.<br />First, the obvious-Mutter wants us to \\"hear\\" this disc with our eyes. The accompanying notes are filled with the art of Gotthard Graubner as well as some lovely photos of Mutter. While some people seem to have a problem with this \\"commercialism,\\" I do not (icing on the cake if you ask me).<br />Now, to the actual music-let me start by saying that this is no \\"vanity\\" project (this is Mutter's second recording of the work-so some seem to think her suspect). Whereas Mutter's first recording with Karajan was musically adept and refined, this Four Seasons is the product of true artistry. Pared down but not forced, insightful, but not idiosyncratic--I would say this recording is best described as a playful work of love.<br />This second recording by Mutter tops other Four Seasons that I have head in many ways. In particular--it, like nature, has an innate freedom. This is music that flows naturally, unpredictably, and is always full of wonder.<br />Where this disc truly separates itself from other recordings of the work is in its palpably frigid \\"Winter.\\" Mutter's violin IS the biting cold. You might want to have a sweater handy when you listen.<br />The Devil's Trill, the filler piece on the disc, is possibly given an even better performance than the stunning Four Seasons. Both pieces are programmatic and fantasy driven. Both create stunning sound-pictures.<br />Yet beyond all the fantasy and beauty, this music speaks to me of a greater truth that would at first seem fantasy. Music of this depth and spirit is indeed evidence of an artist in her prime. More importantly, it is further irrefutable evidence of the beauty, depth, wonder, and goodness of the One who set the lights in the expanse of the heavens to mark the Four Seasons.he beauty, depth, wonder, and goodness of the One who set the lights in the expanse of the heavens to mark the Four Seasons.
B000002L5I|5.0|I was driving through Philadelphia about the time this CD was released. I turned on the radio and caught only the last minute of \\"Slow Ride\\" on WMMR. I just had to know what tune they'd just played. I pulled over and did something I never do -- called the DJ to ask what he'd just played. I immediately drove to the nearest music store and bought \\"Trouble Is\\". The point of this little story is that the music on this CD was so refreshing in it's hard hitting blues and rock, and so distictive, that it stands out from the clutter of Pearl Jam/Creed wannabees. The music reminds me of all the things I enjoyed about rock and blues in the late '60's and early '70's. And more importantly, though Kenny Wayne Sheperd was obviously influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughn, his sound is unique for this day and age. This album built upon the roots he established with \\"Ledbedder Heights\\", and is a worthwhile addition to anyone's music collection (provided you eschew the likes of Brittany and J Lo). Rock on.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|It isn't worth buying the new special edition if you own the current &quot;classic&quot; version.  There is a certain novelty to watching the new song put into the movie that you have grown to love, but it really isn't worth buying a movie you already have.
0618001905|4.0|The rarely told, indeed deliberately forgotten, tale of the greed of King Leopold II, who through hypocrisy, false promises, obfuscations and outright lies, took possession of the Congo.  Under his rule, which he tried to depict as beneficial to the natives (bringing the savages the ennobling light of civilization, the typical Victoriam delusions), a sadistic form of slavery was the order of the day.  Leopold's reign, offically endorsing mutilation, whipping, massacre and kidnapping, oversaw the killing of fully half the Congo's population, a figure Hochschild and others estimate at ten million deaths.  This is a chilling book, written as an indictment without a single false step.  The pacing is deliberate, the charges made plain, the research thorough.  It's a harrowing tale, and Hochschild peoples it with villains and heroes (the great pioneers of the human rights movements that challenged Leopold's self-serving catalogue of lies).  Hochschild never manages to secure absolute evidence that Leopold knew of the atrocities, but given the detail-obsessed, controlling personality that emerges from the book, it seems that the king had to know at least most of what went on.  An indispensable work of history.
B000084T18|5.0|As soon as I heard \\"Wanksta\\" last year on the 8 Mile soundtrack I thought that 50 was hot. I then started finding some more of his songs on the internet and 50 quickly became one of my favorite rappers. I heard his CD was going to be coming out and I couldn't wait. However, I then started to think that there is no way that Get Rich Or Die Tryin could live up to my expectations. Thankfully, it did. Even though it was just released in February, this CD has to be in the running for album of the year. Pretty much every single track is hot on the CD. I was pretty disappointed with \\"Like My Style\\", \\"Don't push me\\", and \\"Patiently Waiting\\" (Don't push me, and Patiently waiting are both produced by Eminem who I think is overrated as a producer). Otherwise the songs are all very good. Some of the most outstanding are: Many Men, Heat(great Dre beat using a gun cocking and shooting), Back Down(great Ja Rule diss track), What up Gangsta, High all the time, Life's on the Line(great bonus track that I already had), and U Not Like Me(another great bonus track that is not new but still awesome). Overall, this is a fantastic album, not the best hip-hop album ever but still very good, and I recommend that every real hip-hop fan should own this CD.
B00003CXXM|3.0|&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is, in a good sense, a very old-fashioned spy film, and for that same reason it would be hated by many viewers.  A film about an amnesiac person involved into a chain of intrigues and plots is nothing new if you only remember &quot;Long Kiss Good Night&quot;; the difference is, the pace of &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is, for modern audience, a little too slow, and except for the presence of character actor Brian Cox, it has nothing in common with Lenny Harlin's ridiculously pumped up action scenes.<br />The story is all too basic.  A guy who lost his memory played by Matt Damon is found on the stormy sea by Italian fishermen, and he seeks for his identity.  On his way through Eupope, he attactes unwelcome guests coming to elinimate him, but with unexpected physical and mental skills he fends off every attack made on him.  So, who is he?  Anyone?  <br />This is so easy a question, so don't bother.  The point is, there are actions that might be seen in the spy films made in 1970s or before.  Sure, there are car chases, and surveillance system using computers, but the actions are all, as I said, old-fashioned.  And the fact is we have seen so many explosions and CGIs during the 90s (like &quot;Total Recall&quot; and any action flick you name), so the style of &quot;The Bounre Identity&quot; looks too old and stale.  But folks, originally, spies are supposed to be low-profile, so there's nothing wrong with understated handling of actions.  And the photography captures the atmospher of traditional European sceneries, in town and country.<br />But there are some complaints I have to make, and one is that the film is too, a way too, predictable.  Though Matt Damon is cast well, usually excellent actors like Chris Cooper and Clive Owen are all wasted as the characters that should be given more substance.  They look like desposable villains from episodes of any spy/action TV series, who are nothing but cypher.  <br />And the other, and bigger complaint is the way of using female players, especially Franka Potente, &quot;Lola &quot; of &quot;Run Lola Run.&quot;  There is nothing that reminds us of the energetic existence of the red-haired runner, but she is just a secondary role nobody really cares.  This is typical of Hollywood film when they use European actresses -- see &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; for instance -- and there again, they did it.  And if you brink your eyes, you will miss the lovely Julia Stiles (what is she doing here?).<br />As a whole agreeable, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is, however, a kind of spy film that critics love, but not exactly all audiences.  But critics are those professinal people who have seen many older films, and that will explain.
B00004LN16|5.0|I am a thirteen-year old fan of AC/DC and I was a little uneasy about buying this album because other reviews said their music weakened, Johnson's voice weakened and they lost their touch. I was astounded at the greatness of BACK IN BLACK and HIGHWAY TO HELL so I had to buy this album. I was astounded by it's greatness! There is not one bad song on here. As for Johnson's voice, I like it better this way because it's more of singing than shrieking as on BACK IN BLACK. It sounds deeper than his earlier almost screaming voice. It's a different sound than BACK IN BLACK but it's not worse, but then again it's not better. If I was old enough to say I was a fan since HIGH VOLTAGE then this would probably be a different review.<br />     Some said this was a return to their BACK IN BLACK sound but it's more of return to HIGHWAY TO HELL. AC/DC is incredible and it's amazing that they can be that old and still rock! It's also amazing that they can appeal to a younger generation. All the kids at school still talk about and sing some songs on BACK IN BLACK.<br />      Half my class said this album was better than BACK IN BLACK. If AC/DC is reading then I want them to know that they shouldn't give up and they still have it! ...
0451163516|5.0|This story is set London in early 1914 as Germany was mobilizing and war was inevitable to those that history would prove astute.  France was in peril even if England assisted, and the British Empire itself would be at risk if the Germans prevailed.  So, The First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Winston Churchill of the Liberal government, armed with a note from King George, convinces The (conservative) Earl of Walden to negotiate a secret treaty with his wife's nephew, Alex Orlov, also nephew to the Czar, for Russia to enter into the fray.  The anarchists learn of this plot however, and Feliks, The Man from St. Petersburg, has five pounds sterling and a determination to assassinate Alex Orlov on English soil.<br />This story is rich with the history that bored us in school, that stuff about Victorian pomp and starving Russian peasants floundering for a new political order, the prelude to communism.  Follett gives us a sense of the debauchery bred from wealth and privilege, and the desperation born of inhumanities in an era gone by.  He introduces us to men threatened by women's suffrage, others terrorized of government, and through them, we better understand why society changed, or perhaps mutated.  That stuff is woven seamlessly into a story of intrigue without long speeches or tedious lectures.  We get our lesson without having to take notes.<br />My only quarrel is Follett's propensity to interrupt with back-story, once with back-story within back-story if I'm not mistaken.  It's a minor irritation though, one scratch and it's gone, because we are more worried about how his characters are going to sort out the mess they're in.  And in the end, you're going to believe The Man from St. Petersburg might have been.
B00004SC3M|4.0|Firstly, you have to go with the Widescreen format, there's just no better way to watch a movie. I purchased this DVD at a reasonable price, and upon receiving it, watched it immediately. I'd seen it in the theaters once previously. This is the type of movie, though, that you enjoy seeing in your home. It's not bursting at the seams with special effects, it's just a great movie.<br />I have to say that &quot;The Rock&quot; is probably a more thrilling movie, and slightly less typical than &quot;Entrapment&quot;. This film, while being intriguing and entertaining, throws back to Connery as James Bond. His sophisticated style and wit are humorous and convincing in this action flick. However, similar to &quot;The Rock&quot;, I absolutley feel that the cast in &quot;Entrapment&quot; is solid. It was filmed wonderfully, and there are some sultry scenes with Catherine Zeta Jones. And some of the landscapes, and open scenes are just amazing. Picturesque views of Connery's character's house, inside and out, are a definite highlight.<br />All-in-all, there are only a few movies I can put on when a group of friends come over for a movie night, nevermind something that I'm interested in - but &quot;Entrapment&quot; really fits the bill.
B000004756|5.0|&quot;Friday Night in San Francisco&quot; is both among one of the greatest live recordings of all time and among the greatest classical/flamenco guitar recordings ever. The interplay is stunning between John McLaughlin, Al DiMeola, and Paco De Lucia, three of the greatest musical geniuses of our time (and I do not say that lightly...the music these three produce on their own is always full of rich texture, technical brilliance, and musical quality). This '96 recording, while not possessing the same magic as the &quot;Friday Night...&quot; recording (how could it, when that was one of those magical nights when everything looks, sounds, and FEELS good?), is still a wonderful piece of work. It's clear that between these three guitarists is a rapport that stands the test of time, a collaboration the likes of which most bands can only strive for, that sense of mutual cooperation and enjoyment that just enhances the goodness of the music they make. Each person has their moment to shine, either as a soloist, or as a songwriter. I am partial to &quot;Espiritu&quot; and &quot;Azzura,&quot; both penned by Al DiMeola, but the opening track, &quot;La Estiba&quot; by Paco De Lucia tells you, right away from the first notes that this is going to be a beautiful listening experience.<BR>This is the kind of music for any occasion. Need background music for a party? This is perfect. Need to unwind after a long day at work? Or maybe you need something to hear while at work? Pop this in. Need to feel good after feeling bad? This music will do it. This is the kind of album that reminds us why we love music in the first place. Of course nothing can rival or compare to &quot;Friday Night...&quot;, but this comes in at a close second, and it should belong in any true music lover's collection.

B00005JLS0|2.0|Out of all the movies Grant and Bullock have ever done which is the most re-occurring genre? Rom-com.<br />How many rom-coms are out there (especially at present)? Too many.<br />What new material/angle does Two Weeks Notice offer? None.<br />There really is no point in this movie. It was only made because the public still go to see the same predictable rubbish over and over and therefor would more than likely make a profit.<br />Every single rom-com clich&eacute; you can think of is in this movie: The High Flying Businessman, the lowly and accident-prone but clever pretty girl, the snaky but attractive woman introduced halfway-thru who may become a threat to the clever pretty girl, the 'world is a safe place' backdrop, the ratty ex-wife, women who cry at the mere mention (or even suggestion) of the word 'love' and a general sense of security in KNOWING how the movie will end.<br />It's not even a slick looking film from a directing point of view. The photography is muddy, grey and unattractive, the production design is muted to the point of invisibility and the whole enterprise just feels so...pedestrian.<br />The only people I could recommend this to are those who have never seen Hugh Grant play a dashing English gent or Sandra Bullock play an unlucky in love (how?) but strong-minded heroine. Unfortunately that only adds up to about 4 people and those who have been in comas for the past decade.<br />Even the poster is even more basic than usual. EVERY rom-com in existence has the man and woman only on a white background. How imaginative! Only this time it just looks plainer. Much like the film.

B00007KWHN|5.0|First of all, if you don't already own this album why not? This is the first truly spectacular Yes album in the Almighty Yes Trilogy (including \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Close To The Edge\\"). \\"Your Move\\" is the quintessential Yes song and \\"Starship Trooper\\" is pure prog rock ecstasy. That being said, this is also the third re-issue of this album on CD and I'll be damned if Atlantic is going to con me into buying it again just for a few bonus tracks. The album has already been digitally remastered once, what do I look like, an idiot? Fuggedaboutit.

B00000JFV9|5.0|I had heard a few Curtis Mayfield songs randomly all of my life, and I knew that I liked him.  But one day, I saw a brief documentary about the movie Superfly and the soundtrack.  It seemed like something I would like and so I gave it a shot.  I must say, I was ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY.  Unfortunately, I received my shipment & headed right to work, so I was trying to get things done that day while I was first listening to it.  But as each new track came up, I keep needing to pause just to really listen.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  This man was a genius.  I have listened to this album over and over again and hear new nuances each time.  His ability to blend the perfect music genre for the film with poignant and spot-on lyrics is incredible.  I could picture everything in my mind just by listening to him.  I am now a confirmed Curtis Mayfield devotee, and would recommend this to anyone interested in hearing great music and maybe learning a thing or two along the way.  We lost a true musical gift when he passed away.  This soundtrack is absolutely amazing.

B00006JL1Z|5.0|This is a well compiled and beautifully remastered collection of Buckingham-Nicks era Fleetwood Mac. It contains just about every essential track you could fit on two discs. I really wish they could have fit &quot;Fireflies&quot; on there somewhere but I guess you can't have everything. If you could, there would be Peter Green and Bob Welch era stuff crammed on here too. There's one thing that I don't understand regarding the track selection though. If they could include the single remixes of &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Sisters of the Moon&quot;, why didn't they include the single version of &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; that contains the electric guitar overdubs? It would've been nice. But this is so much great music that it definitely deserves the highest rating.
0440237688|4.0|We've read the book \\"The Giver\\" in our English lessons in school.<BR>First, it was very difficult to read, but the more we read, the more we understood. It was interesting to get to know such a world which is so different to ours: no colours, no love, no  emotions,... It was Jonas's assignment to become \\"The Receiver\\" to get all those memories back. It was exciting to read how Jonas bears them. <BR>We like the fact that Louis Lowry chose an open end, because everybody can use his or her own imagination to decide what will happen next. <BR>All in all, we think the book is very advisable to read!
B000003TAW|5.0|There's not too much that can be said about this masterpiece that everyone else in the world isn't already saying about it.

B0000797IO|2.0|I rented this movie expecting a GOOD movie. I guess the acting was ok and everything, after all, it did raise emotions in me that I haven't felt towards a movie in a long time: Anger. It wasn't the actors fault I don't think. The movie flat out could have been better written. Instead I wound up so angry at just about every turn this movie took, and really disliking pretty much every character in this movie. The thing with Bubba was totally unnecessary and I think was the point I went from thinking this movie might make a possible recovery to just being a waste of my time and those people's talent.

B0000039QA|4.0|Okay, everybody knows that Biggie's second album, Life After Death, ain't classic or flawless by any means. Biggie's lyrics, on the other hand, ARE classic and flawless. No disrespect to Posdunos from De La Soul, but every word that Biggie said should be a Hip-Hop Quotable. Can you really find anyone else who can get away with saying, \\"Be more gone (read: Morgan) than Freeman\\" (from \\"My Downfall\\")? I don't think so.<br />Biggie does a great job of telling stories which got people to compare his abilities to Nas (seriously), Rakim, and Kool G Rap. \\"Somebody's Gotta Die\\" and \\"N's Bleed\\" are very vivid and believable. Then you have the party tracks like \\"Mo Money, Mo Problems\\" and \\"Nasty Boy\\", which find Biggie still dropping lyrical gems despite the jiggy production. And then comes the gangsta tracks like Primo's two contributions, \\"Kick in the Door\\" (which was supposedly dissing Boot Camp Click and Nas) and \\"Ten Crack Commandments\\". I honestly think that Biggie rhymes best on Primo (and Easy Mo Bee) tracks. And I was even surprised to see Biggie successfully speed-rapping with Bone thugs-n-harmony (minus Wish) on \\"Notorious Thugs\\".<br />The production on here isn't as thuggush ruggish as it was on Ready to Die and \\"radio airplay\\" seemed to be on the A&R's mind while compiling this album (remember \\"Missing You\\", \\"Sky's the Limit\\", and the R. Kelly-assisted \\"F.Y.T.\\"?), but the album is worth getting for B.I.G.'s science alone.

Without a word being spoken, the intro to the song quickly explains the realitys of war and how quickly it can get out of control. .... <BR> Love in Vain: A mournful song about loving someone and not getting it back, with instrumental solos explaining just that.<BR> Country Honk: The earlier version of the Stone's hit Honky Tonk Woman, a great country song.<BR> Live with Me: The name says it all.One of the sexually provacative than all the other songs on this album combined, but with a great tune.<BR> Let it Bleed: A great song, combining interesting lyrics with enjoyable music.<BR> Midnight Rambler:This song is another great hit, and reasonably so. With an insane desire for a certain death that borderes on insanity, this one will last in your mind long after you've listened to it. But for me, it was the bluesey harmonica that made this a great song.<BR> You Got the Silver:A very touching song, with a caring that's contrary to some songs on the album.<BR> Monkey Man:A drug song at its core, but with meaning.A very up-and-at-ya beat.<BR> You Can't Aways Get What you Want: A great, great song.With Lyrics that are relative to the Beatle's Hey Jude, a great song with great music, made so by the small orchestra that plays in the background to a touching choir complementing the lyrics.Another justified hit.<BR> If you want to start, or even finish, your Stone's collection, this album would do it.
B000084T18|5.0|All fans of true hip-hop/gangsta rap have been waiting about five years for somebody to come along and knock the rap world on it's ...The wait is over. 50 cent has come along and will finally take rap back to a level where it was in the early & mid 90's. This is the most exciting moment for a hip-hop fan since the release of Makavelli's last album(while he was still alive). I've only heard about half of the cd, but this is truly, truly a masterpiece. Eminem is probably the most talented lyrical tactician out right now, but(sadly, because of the color of his skin) he will never be able to get truly gritty on the mic. People, if you're even a little bit interested in rap, invest in this album, you will not be sorry you did. Plus he busts on them \\"wankstas\\" for murda, inc., and that should be enough to make you want to own this cd.
0321127420|5.0|Got this book last night, and am very impressed.  I had read one of Fowlers previous books (Analysis Patterns) and had not been terribly impressed.  Do not confuse the two books - they are worlds apart.<br />The book follows the same format as Design Patterns [Gang of Four], with the addition of a very helpful cheat sheets on the back inside cover.  The book gives overviews of maybe 50 (I did not count) patterns commonly found in object-oriented systems.<br />IMO, the identification of the patterns themseleves is the great achievement of this book.  The descriptions are great, with examples in Java and C#.  I found the examples hard to read, because the code of a single class is often interspersed with comments, as well as code from other classes.  A minor annoyance in the scheme of things.<br />This is not a book I will ever read from cover to cover - I found myself skipping from chapter to chapter to get brief overviews of what each pattern involved.  Sortof a recursive read :)<br />Overall, for object oriented programmers, I would say &quot;buy the book&quot;.  I think that it will become a classic, as &quot;Design Patterns&quot; has already.  Well worth the (somewhat high) price.
0316666343|5.0|This book is touching and memorable, the closest thing I've read to &quot;literature&quot; in years.<br />However, readers with closed minds may not be able to get past their narrow view of the world and the hereafter to grasp what Sebold is talking about.
B00006LIRI|4.0|I would give this CD five stars if it contained U2's best songs of the 90's. But it doesn't!<br />Where is \\"The Fly\\" - the first single off Achtung Baby? Where is the single or album version of \\"Lemon\\" - the most popular song on Zooropa? What about Pop's most important song - \\"Mofo\\"? What about the single - \\"Please\\"?<br />Why is \\"Beautiful Day\\" and \\"Stuck in a Moment...\\" on this basically 90's CD? Shouldn't they really begin the next Best Of version: 2000 - 2010?<br />If I wasn't a fan I would be extremely unimpressed with some of the remixes, especially \\"Staring at the Sun\\". I would like to have the album-versions of these songs that I remembered and liked at the time.<br />I still bought this CD because I am a U2 fan, and I guess if you're not a U2 'fan' than you would buy this CD before you bought any other U2 album anyway - as most people that build up a collection of CD's usually start with the greatest hits CD's.<br />This CD does provide for the general music fan, but as a U2 fan I'm a little disappointed.
B00006LJ72|5.0|I just got through listening to the most beautiful CDs to come out of the music industry!An artist like Enya only comes once-in-a-lifetime and this box set comes once in a lifetime.This is truly a gift from her and her lyricists and producer to us all!Even though some of the songs have been recorded before there is so much here that it truly is a gift!This is also a limited edition so you can't put a value on it.It is truly a work of love, and if you want to really know Enya this is for you.When you listen to this CD you will be able to travel through the stars with her for a long time to come.thank you Enya!
0440237688|4.0|I found \\"the Giver\\" most time exciting and I can recommend it to all those, who like science fiction, like I do.<BR>In the beginning it seemed to be very odd to me, because of the strange rules like evening-telling, but you'll notice soon that this story plays in another world.It's exciting to imagine a world without colors, feelings, animals and own decisions.<BR>One can very good identify with Jonas, an 11-year old boy who'll turn 12 and who'll get his assignment to bear the burden of his whole Community.<BR>I didn't like the open end and I would have liked it if I had got more information about the Elsewhere. There are a lot of questions which are not answered to me, but all in all I liked it much.
B00005NRN9|5.0|This DVD is amazing, the visual effects, the performance of the artist, colors and the music. This DVD is a &quot;must have&quot; in your collection. If you don't have any of the dvd's of the Cirque du Soleil is a great buy the 3 pack (Journey of man, Dralion and Quidam) those 3 are great!
B00004YKUY|1.0|While I can agree that Steve A. does have a good voice...I can't get past the fact that he sounds like some Steve Perry wannabe, who is desperately trying to mimic his voice.  I was a huge journey fan from the beginning and really tried to give Steve A. a chance, but I guess once you get used to the excellence that is Steve Perry, some mediocre copycat singer simply won't do!  I don't recommend this album if you're someone who loves Steve Perry, unless you can over look the poor attempt at copying.
081541028X|5.0|Michael Collins is one of the best pilots NASA ever saw, but you won't know that from this book.  He is a very humble man who writes with wonderful humor and clarity.  His story of his role in the race to the moon is interesting, informative, funny and absolutely incredible.  He teaches physics,politics and good writing form in one incredible book.  Because Collins is able to so clearly explain the science of flying, I highly recommend this book as a starting place for anyone interested in learning about the early days of the space program.  To learn more about the respect others at NASA have for Mike Collins, I recommend &quot;Deke!&quot; and &quot;Last Man on the Moon.&quot;
B000084T18|3.0|If you are thinking about buying this album based on the songs you have heard on the radio, you may be dissapointed because there is nothing as catchy as &quot;wanksta&quot; and &quot;In da club&quot; on here. While &quot;21 questions&quot; if released as a single will definitely keep 50's momentum going on the radio, the harder tracks on here are average at best. &quot;Backdown&quot; and &quot;If I cant&quot; being two of the better ones. Trying to compare this to Tupac or Biggies work is crazy. Not even close. As far as debuts go Jayz's debut album &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; blows this out of the water, never mind the Biggie and Pac masterpieces!! Come to think of it the white kid from Detroit who produced and rhymes on a couple of the tracks (&quot;Patiently Waiting&quot; being one of the stronger tracks) comes much closer to being cut from the same cloth as a Big and Pac, but doesnt get recognized for it cause of the color of his skin. Just listen to how much tighter his flow is than 50's on the joints they do together. Anyway, thats a whole other debate in itself. Sorry if Im being to critical cause this album is worth the buy, but if you are looking for slammin beats and sick flows go pick up Raekwons first solo project &quot;Only Built for Cuban Linxs&quot;. Now thats &quot;Heat&quot;.
079213690X|5.0|Mel Gibson shines in this superb historical film, portraying the life of William Wallace. This is, without a doubt Mel Gibson's finest performance of them all, and his acting style is inimitable. It is a highly vivid portrayal of the heart of fierce combat, tender love, and perseverance in pursuing freedom. It is the story of the rallying of countrymen by William Wallace to fight for the cause of freedom from the British. Braveheart is an extremely well-done film that I wholeheartedly reccomend to anyone age 13 and up, due to extremely brutal medieval warfare. The main point the film is trying to make is this: Every man dies, not every man really lives. Very thought-provoking. 5 stars.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Is Episode I a good movie, you ask.....you bet....is it a great movie,..actually...yes it is....While it might have its quiks...Ep. I is exciting and entertaining with great scence and great characters...and a whole lot of science fiction fun too,and anyone who can take 30's space fantasy and adventure theater,..japanese movies, cowboys and westerns,...biblical and messianic undertones and mix it with egptian prophetcy and fairy tails deserves a lot of credit and all the awards he can get....The DVD is spectacular,a world-class first -rate production...showing once again that OL' Georgie leaves 'em all in the dust...so go out and get it today...
