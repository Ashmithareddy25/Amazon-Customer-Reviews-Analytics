B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had obviously heard of the book and what it was about and did not think the subject would interest me.  In fact, I thought it sounded pretty awful.  Friends kept recommending it, so I tried it.  Could not put the book down!  Grabbed me from page one.  Cannot wait to read the two others in the trilogy.  Well done!!!

0316056898|5.0|Here are three words to describe Bossypants by writer and comedian Tina Fey: Funny, insightful and empowering.<br /><br />American comedian Tina Fey has written a down-to-earth book about how to take your personality strengths, natural gifts and talents and then, use them to create a successful career.<br /><br />Tina's autobiography takes the reader from her formative growing up years through to her current successful New York show business years. Her journey is a testament to her focus, persistence and sense of humor. Tina Fey's journey is basically the same as every woman looking to discover herself - Bossypants is about the life lessons that help us develop unstoppable self-confidence and self-determination.<br /><br />I read this book from a \\"Business Coach\\" prospective, knowing that I wanted to write a review for women in business. Here are some of the business-building tools I learned from reading Tina Fey's Bossypants:<br /><br />1. We often find our \\"calling\\" by accident - it comes as a summer job or, finding a group of like-minded people with whom we can relate or, by taking chances and going with our heart instead of following the crowd.<br /><br />2. Often times, it is better to collaborate than to compete.<br /><br />3. In the world of comedy, women have to often overcome the perception and stereotype that \\"women aren't funny.\\"<br /><br />4. In order to succeed, be yourself and be willing to learn, grow and come out of your comfort zone.<br /><br />5. Rarely, if ever, is someone an overnight success.<br /><br />6. Working mothers, no matter the occupation, have to find a work and home life balance that suits their lifestyle.<br /><br />7. A sense humor can keep you going, especially when the going gets tough.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all women who are thinking of starting a career, are currently in a career and wanting to move forward and women who have succeeded in their own careers and want to read the success story of someone else who went for their goals. You'll laugh out loud in several spots, I promise you.<br /><br />I love a good autobiography especially when it is a story of a woman who has overcome personal and professional obstacles and had the determination and inner strength to make her own successes.<br /><br />I'll say this again, Bossypants is funny, insightful and personally and professionally empowering.for their goals. You'll laugh out loud in several spots, I promise you.<br /><br />I love a good autobiography especially when it is a story of a woman who has overcome personal and professional obstacles and had the determination and inner strength to make her own successes.<br /><br />I'll say this again, Bossypants is funny, insightful and personally and professionally empowering.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|What a fantastic film.  George Clooney's classic star-dom mixed with the comic relief of the other two set the stage for a film that, on the surface, is light and lifting, and deeper down, full of allusions to Greek myths.<br /><br />This is a film that truly appeals to everyone.  Whether you're looking for a hilariously tongue-in-cheek southern escape tale or a wonderfully knit, deep plot, this movie is for you.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I had read good things about this book but I found it hard to read.  I had to make myself finish it because I thought it would get better but it did not get better.  Can't say it got worse but just not as good as I had heard.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I had pre-ordered this so that I would have received it on it's release date but had failed to receive it. I called the next day to see where my order was and was responded with &#34;sir, we seem to have lost your order and your tracking number is invalid.&#34; I expressed my frustration because I had paid for the 2-day shipping was told that I wasn't going to receive my copy for 3 more days. To help subside my annoyance the customer service rep gave me a $9.99 promo code to use on any Amazon product. It really did make up for the mishap. Customer service was great and I just received my movie.<br /><br />The movie itself is great (albeit some choppy singing due to miscasting) and the Blu-ray combo pack was heckuva steal for $19.99. Great purchase and great customer service by Amazon.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Was a well written book.  It kept my attention the whole way.  It is hard to say you love a book when the subject is sad but I like the book a lot.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|I first encountered Ms. Adichie's writing in the One World Anthology and quickly became a fan.  I have since recommended this book to several of my friends.  Ms. Adichie has a very nice, free flowing writing style that draws readers into the story as if they were actually present when the story is taking place.  The book is grounded in historical facts about Nigeria's civil war which I was largely ignorant of prior to picking up this book.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This was a Beautiul movie especially for the more thoughtful viewer ((I liked it anyway). The best director Oscar was well-deserved.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Ted was pretty much everything it aspired to be: a goofy, forgettable buddy comedy.  It's got some raunchy moments, a great tribute to one of the cheesiest of cheesy 80s films, and a shoehorned romantic subplot to tie it all together.  It's a great &#34;oh, this is on. It's a rainy Saturday afternoon and I have nothing better to do&#34; kind of film, but not something I would go out of my way to watch again.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This movie was wonderful.  It was beautiful to look at-a very moving and touching movie.  Have recommended to everyone.  Thank you for the great work put into this film.  Have a blessed day.
B00BF11STU|5.0|The trailer that's all over TV for Zero Dark Thirty gives the impression that the movie might document Navy SEAL Team 6's prep and execution of the mission in May 2011 that got Osama bin Laden. However, I was surprised to find that that the 2 ½ hour runtime of the film was much more about the other heroes...the heroes involved in the investigation and decade-long hunt for the diabolical al-Qaeda terrorist kingpin.<br /><br />The 2 ½ hours actually went by quite quickly. Director Kathryn Bigelow did a tremendous job of keeping the information flow interesting, disturbing, unsettling, exciting and seemingly very real. I felt like a fly on the wall watching the grueling 10-year investigation in a matter of hours. And the lead actors really earned all of the accolades for making the viewer feel like they were watching footage of some amazing, horrible but actual events.<br /><br />Ultimately, the movie does conclude with one of the most memorable, intense and captivating 30 - 45 minutes of a movie that I've ever watched as SEAL Team 6 does their thing. But it is the entire 10 year process that is presented expertly in Zero Dark Thirty makes this film so deserved of all of the critical nominations and essential viewing for all.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|THIS MOVIE WAS QUITE WHAT THE TITLE SAYS EXCEPT \\"THAT LAST COMEDY MOVIE YOULL EVER PICK UP TO THE LEFT\\". IT SUCK. AND I CANT BELIEVE I PAID MONEY TO WATCH THIS IN THE THEATER
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I wish it wasn't so expensive to evolve your dinosaurs though. It puts a hold on everything else you could do..but it's fun for now

B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Great Filter for scuba diving makes a world of difference in color correction. Would recommend this produce to a friend.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I haven't stop playing thus game since I downloaded it thus game has me jumping at very turn I give it five starts
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I never figured out how to use it and get more then one picture.  I would need a print book of directions that I could use while holding the camera in my hand
B004IAIXWK|2.0|I'm not commenting on the storyline or any aspects of the movie.<br />I just wanted to comment on the quality of this on my Amazon Kindle HD.<br />There was a weird buzzing sound, and I had to play other videos and movies and listen to some songs to see if anything was wrong with my kindle. It didn't happen to any of my other videos and movies or the songs. I think it has to be this movie, but it was simply too annoying to sit through the entire movie.
B009KUWWW0|1.0|This is just a a rerun of The Pillars of the Earth.  Lets not build a church, lets build a bridge.  Same characters with new names.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|This game is good fun. The only down side is waiting for things to upgrade. It is hard to get gems and funds without buying. It also states you don't need to play with others but sets challenges with others. But I have enjoyed the game play overall.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|I did not see this in a theater but watched it first on DVD.<br /><br />Like other great movies you pick up on new angles every time you watch it.  It revolves around a husband and father who wakes up one day to realize that his life has become a desperate day to day grind and he decides to recapture the fun of his youth.  To that end he quits his job and takes one flipping burgers as he did in high school.  He also starts working out and getting high.  He is motivated by lust for his daughter,s friend and ultimately the changes that he makes lead to serious results for everyone in his world.<br /><br />Ricky, a neighbor who is always filming things sums up this movie with his statement that he realized \\"there was this whole world behind things.\\"  In this story we get to see the world behind what appears on the surface to be a normal family living in the suburbs.<br /><br />This movie is proof that with great writing, directing, and acting you can enjoy it without CGI.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is cool, it has more than 101 games, its awesome. I like the concept of it,the more coins, the more games, the more coins etc. etc.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I downloaded on my 3 year old son's Nabi tablet. After I downloaded it, I noticed it is too advanced for him. It will be a fun game for a kid who can read.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game has challenging levels and many to play.  I am glad I chose this game.  The graphics are easier to see.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Once I downloaded dictionary it was perfect! Only issue was synching with cell phone kindle app. It wasn't too many pages off. I just looked at page number on my cell and jumped to that page with no problem. I use to be big on the old fashion way of having a book to carry around, but now I can't see myself not using kindle. Especially with the dictionary function!
B009KEN87O|5.0|remember this type of video came as a kid.  much more fun now...no going thru quarters. fun for my kids now.

B006LSZECO|1.0|The book is so bizarre.  A side of human nature that i do not want to ever consider polluting my brain with
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I wanted a weather report instantly. This does exactly that. I would recommend this app to everyone. Quick and easy.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I was just looking for something mindless to watch and was pleasantly surprised by this romantic comedy. Funny, heart warming, and fun!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Austin's humor comes from a penetrating understanding of humanity, the follies and the virtues both.  Pride and Prejudice is a page-turner.  That fact surprised me!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I haven't had time to fully check this out but I already love what I've seen so far! CAN'T WAIT TO REALLY DIG IN!
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I've watched this movie probably 7 times in the past 3 years? I'm not one to rewatch movies though. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. The amazing screenplay is enough to have you loving this movie. Okay not enough? The acting is fabulous and I'm not a big brad pitt fan, but love him in this movie. Okay not enough, still? The soundtrack is AMAZING!! Okay, not enough still????? The ending is AWESOME!!!!!! You really have to watch this movie. If you like good movies that is.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is cool!It's like some kind of story. They give surprises and big happiness.It's so entertaining game. I really appreciate your game. I'll book you as a friend in facebook if I had a facebook account. Thank you for an great and adventurous game.
B000WN4MVS|4.0|I've loved this movie since I was a youngin. It has a lot of cheesy jokes, and cheesy effects, but its still a good movie. Not the best movie ever, but def. worth the watch. Much better then the remake, I think.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Interesting insites.This is not a light read, but one that can give you a good understanding of the near death experience.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Funny and cute, this movie really is a classic that you have to love. Of course it's a musical so if your not into musicals.. you should still watch it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this a very cool game you get to buy your upgrades also you get to buy which people you want to be.
B004RL9T50|5.0|What a wonderful movie! Such an awesome plot! Very truthful and moving. Man doesn't know place in the world. Most people don't realize it takes someone with a lot of heart and determination and really true morality and will to be a hero. Superhero or everyday hero. GREAT MOVIE!!
B007N6NGYG|5.0|This is a Very nice app. It is very well thought out and designed. It has great puzzle levels that get progressively more challenging.
B003SJ6W4I|2.0|Furry Vengeance had all the ingredients for a heartwarming, slapstick comedy.  Brendan Fraser?  Love him!  Brooke Shields?  Awesome!  But the script was terrible.  That is the only reason I rated this film a two.  The acting, the animals, score, sets, cinematography and effects were very good.  The script is an impossible, confounding mess that the Green Party would not endorse.  Instead of just going with &#34;bad guys want to tear down forest leaving animals homeless,&#34;  they went with &#34;bad guy wants to build some solar-powered, green homes in a massive forest, trap and relocate the animals, and pour millions of dollars into a local economy of a town that really needs it.<br /><br />Brendan Fraser has a snotty teenage son who is enamored with a local girl who says &#34;relocating the animals is the same as killing them.&#34;  What???  So the animals, led by a raccoon (adorable)  terrorize Brendan Fraser until he goes ... well, I won't spoil the end, but I would just watch the funny clips on You Tube.  The funniest is a dream where the animals are partying in Brendan's kitchen.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is not too bad. always did like the point and click adventure games. wish the story was a little longer though.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|I love Harlan Cohen's suspenseful story telling...the ending is never how you expect it. This is a great book to read!!!
0762777931|5.0|Well written, full of information about diet, health and food with good recipes.  It is a good addition to any library.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who is dealing with a struggle that they don't know how to overcome. It is beautiful.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This app is pretty good. The graphics are good and everything'  this may just become my new favorite game :)
B007ZXK08C|2.0|I was expecting more suspense and suspected the outcome quite early on and was a little disappointed that I was right. Not really the thriller of the year for me.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise. I expected a painfully loud and obnoxious movie as my son is 10 after all! To my delight, this was a good story with some cool references to old technology. As a non gamer, I still enjoyed the movie.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I know this because I was sad that it was done. I wanted more. I wanted to know about Charlie's life post high school.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|The product came undamaged and speedily. The film itself is imaginative and really entertaining. I admire Brandon Lee, rest his soul. Great film!
B0013D6LEM|5.0|What else would you expect?  King of Pop with one of his greatest albums of all time.  No more explanation necessary.
B000AXSN5G|2.0|Any review of Prairie Wind should take into consideration that most of it was written when Neil had a brain aneurysm and thought he was dying. I think that is why a lot of it is down tempo and sappy. We all might be introspective and wispy if we too thought we were about to die. But surprise! His surgery was a success, and now his supposed final album is just \\"another album\\" inserted on the shelf with the other Neil Young cds.<br /><br />In that light, this album kind of sucks. Neil is at his about-to-cry shaky voiced best on this all-acoustic, brush-those-drums album, telling his wife how much he has always loved her in case his brain explodes before they finish tracking, but now that it didn't happen, you can be sure that Neil just kind of looked around afterwards, sorry that he'd been so embarassingly sentimental. \\"Oh, uh, yeah Peg I love you, er, no, we'll go out to eat next week maybe. I've got all the time in the world it seems, huh huh, ... damn it all.\\" He reminisces about his childhood growing up in Mooseland, like you would if you were on your deathbed trying to talk over the iPods of your bored grandchildren, trying desperately to tell them about the pre-internet good ole days before you shuffle off this mortal coil. Prairie Wind reminds me of the Monte Python skit where someone is killed and then suddenly wakes up and begins to recover, saying \\"I'm not quite dead.\\"<br /><br />In any case, we are better having a bad Neil Young album out there than no Neil Young album, so I'm grateful for Prairie Wind anyway. I'm just glad he's not dead and has now gotten Crazy Horse back together, turned the amps up to 11, and is now showering us in glorious waves of feedback once again instead of pissing in the Prairie Wind.
B00BYOEMTQ|1.0|An apple-shaped figure invades a black doorway. *MATCH STRIKES* WE SEE PETER JACKSON (THE APPLE) LIGHTING A STEEL TORCH WITH IT* MATCH EXTINGUISHED AND ... we see him entering a cube of hollow concrete, presumably a tomb. Yes, it is a tomb... He approaches a coffin and heaves the heavy lid to the floor with a devastating triple-Winter *THUD*. He speaks some enchantments and the coffin's skeletal occupant emerges. A moment later, the figure regenerates some of its old vigor and we see it is JRR Tolkien.<br /><br />Tolkien: What is the meaning of this?<br /><br />*Peter bites his lower lip and emits a swinish \\"hee\\"<br /><br />Peter:  Just wanted to show you a little something...<br /><br />He produces a tablet PC from his black robe and, after logging in discreetly, presses play on his Amazon Prime copy of The Hobbit (Part bloody One). Tolkien, confused but intrigued, crosses his arms and patiently watches the movie in its entirety. The two men remain still for what seems like 2 hours and 49 minutes until suddenly Tolkien flings himself into a juvenile fit of tears. Peter raises the tablet high into the air and giggles like a maniac.<br /><br />Peter:  You wanna know why I did this?!?!<br /><br />Tolkien: I beg of you -- tell me. And I will right whatever wrong I've done to you. (sobbing)<br /><br />Peter:  I did it because I CAN!! *LAUGHS*<br /><br />Tolkien: You sick, sick man!<br /><br />Peter:  Oh, but this is only the beginning... two more feature length segments are<br />  on their way!! Heck, I might even make the last a one a Two-parter!!!<br /><br />With glassy eyes, Tolkien peers at the bearded Kiwi.<br /><br />Peter:  WHOOOO-HA HA HA HA HEE HA HAAAGH!! And there's NOTHING you can do about it!!!!<br /><br />With the culmination of his life's work being torn to shreds before his resurrected eyes, Tolkien heaves a large breath of air and lunges at a sword resting by his tomb. Peter flies into the air and produces a staff from within his robe. The two men lock eyes.<br /><br />Tolkien: I will be forced to stop you if you can't stop yourself!!<br /><br />Peter:  You can't stop me -- I've already gone full George Lucas!! Bwahahahahahaah!!!!<br /><br />Peter fires an energy blast from his staff, knocking Tolkien's legs from under him. The author falls hard on his hip and howls in pain. Peter worms away into a dark corner.<br /><br />The tired author regains himself, holds the sword to his tongue and enchants it. He tosses the blade into the air and it zooms like a magnet toward the tomb's iron exit, illuminating its path in the process. Tolkien bolts, but Peter hurtles deadly lighting at his feet. Tolkien skillfully dodges, but the energy bolts ride past him and destroy the cover of another coffin.<br /><br />The cadaver emerges --- Ermagersh!! -- It's CS Lewis!! Clive takes a razorwire whip from his sarcophagus and slashes it at Peter's staff. The whip catches the chubby kiwi by the ankles and Peter scurries away in fear, abandoning his staff and whelping like a defenseless, computer generated Warg.<br /><br />Tolkien and Lewis embrace in a manly hug and solemnly swear to put a stop to Peter's Hobbit movie trilogy. They exit the tomb and head off into the night, determined to brave their way to Weta HQ, no matter the cost and no matter what lands they should have to pass through to get there.<br /><br />Will you tune in for the remainder of this epic tale??

B0049J2BSM|5.0|Definitely a kids move to watch over and over again!! Disney has come up with a lot of movies and this is up there with Finding Nemo
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Very captivating, a few differences from the books but overall it is good. Can't wait for season 3 to come out on amazon.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Great audio makes for a great movie-watching experience and this sounded great in 7.1 surround.  I suppose it didn't hurt that the movie was a good one too! :-)
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  There was so much fowl language, and too much disrepect displayed by the teenage daughter.<br />I expected the movie to have a better storyline and be funnier.  I would not recommend this film.
1600597963|4.0|This is a book that is lovely to wander though with photos of designs that are inspiring and amazing.  The majority of the book covers good general techniques with tons of photos of beautiful pieces in which those techniques were used. That is the inspiring and amazing part.  It does have a few projects with some nice designs however, I wanted to make all of the inspiring and amazing things shown in the technique sections, .... the ones for which there are no instructions which makes me a little sad.  BUT, I still really really like this book and may use it for more than a picture book if I can get myself to focus on the techniques it's trying to teach me and not the sample photos .. lol.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I loved the MazeRunner trilogy and was very excited about the prequel.  The book is well written and I loved the characters, but the story itself is very sad.  It helped explain how the Flare disease started, but there wasn't anything uplifting about the book at all. I wish I had known that going in because I might not have read it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I'm really enjoying the characters, each episode's unique story line and the story lines that continue through out the season.  I highly recommend it.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Excellent dvd! I can't believe how real the cartoon is. Amazing detail, from the cold breath they breathe out to the feeling of flying you get when Scrooge takes his adventures.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have always been satisfied and impressed with Ebay since 2005 and appreciate its dedication to supply people with valid sellers.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Wonderful series. Keeps you in suspense every week. Can't wait for the next season to come out east years. Janice
B007ZD17XO|3.0|&quot;internet needed to run this application&quot; is a bit on the obnoxious side. A bit uneven in difficulty, otherwise quite addictive gameplay.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I ENJOYED THE FIRST TWO  AND THIS WAS THE BEST, SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT STEIG IS NO LONGER WITH US.<br />ONCE AGAIN THE TRILOGY WAS FABULOUS

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I've never been a Star Trek person, but my son said I had to watch this movie and he was right. It is a great movie! Lots of action and a great story line. It is one I will go back and watch again and recommend to others.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|I felt I was there with the Embassy employees trying to escape from Iran. Viewing their escape was spine-tingling as they rode through the streets, while the mob literally rocked their vehicle. Even though I knew they made it out, I held my breath with them while trying to board the jet, and then while the jet raced down the runway. Even then there was fear they would be shot down over Iranian airspace. I loved it.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|cute game with nice graphics. but got bored of it after a day or so. not as engaging as other games.
B008Y73940|4.0|Great movie - he is a great actor always enjoy watching his movies.  This one is definitely a must watch.

B0084AXZK0|4.0|This is one of my favorite novels by Oscar Wilde. It is a great classic and worth the read. I would highly recommend.
0307891402|5.0|Amazing graphics. Love the filled out map. I'll never have trouble with a quest. I mean you can always look it up online on wikipedia but a book is more convienant sometimes and alot easier than having to search online. Also like how it has maps and atlases of every single location in the whole game. Also love how it gives a template for different builds. Awesome. Love the hardcover because its durable. Best buy in a long time.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. Looks stunning in High Definition. It is great to start over at the beginning to look how it ties in the the finale.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is great!! And it's only &middot;99, one of the best games I have played in a long time!
B001THZAAI|5.0|If you can get over the deliberately &#34;hillbilly&#34; English subtitles intended to match the very regional French, this is the funniest movie imaginable.  Great story.  The product arrived on time, and in good condition, and I have not a single complaint.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The UK version of Downton Abbey is much more inclusive than the PBS version. I had missed the final episode and was delighted to find it on Amazon Prime. I believe I will watch season 4 on Amazon as well. Great show, I wish ther were more series on tv like the excellent acting and presentation of Downton Abbey.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|For starters, not JG's best album.  As far as the product goes, it arrived very quickly (much sooner than expected) and it was very securely packaged (unlike a lot of CDs I've bought in the past).
B003VANOFY|1.0|first off this headset is just bad every ten minutes it would cut out. the sound is crap just everything that can go wrong with a headset does.
B003F29D44|3.0|First half of the movie was  fun.  A young man working very hard to get ahead.  Bud's descent into burglary and theft was a big downer, however.  A movie, which is art, should portray the the world as it \\"might and ought to be\\".
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|I had no idea what I was buying  when I got this movie but it is the best movie I've ever seen LOVE it!  It's a must see must get
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addictive, and gives you new scenery to<br /><br />take in from the last version. Can't wait for the next one!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a good idea to get the world of Jurassic park put in a video game u should really download this app plus it's free
B004XUMMFE|5.0|After years of hearing how good Firefly was, I finally watched it.  Ordered the full DVD set, and Serenity, after seeing the first episode.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Totes amazin!!!!!.....great story of how another hero (much like Percy) earns his place among the seven demigods of the great prophecy... With Piper and Leo at Jason's side....what can go wrong???
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Killer graphics, great story line, and music that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Everything you could ask for in a mystery/find it game. Nice escape from reality.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is Ricks best work to date!!!! This book is full of action, adventure, and plenty of romance.... Beginning with reuniting Percy and Annabeth, then ending with the most unexpected cliffhanger!!!! How does he do it!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this keyboard. I reply to a lot of clients with my phone and have to repeat emails. SwiftKey just knows what I am going to say. It makes my communications so much faster and easier.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I absolutely love her bravery and courage.I would definitely recommend this book to everyone!! It will make u have mixed emotions.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|A continuation of the Hunger Games.  Really enjoyed this book.  Kept wanting to read it to find out what happens next.
B008ENA74E|5.0|A quick read, that almost reads like a who dunnit. In a continuing search to understand the recent financial crisi, this is another must read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just found this series and I absolutely love it!<br />I can't wait to see the other seasons<br />thank you
B00A83075M|5.0|Had to ask the kids to identify characters. LOL  Great story with enough action to satisfy all ages.  Received promptly with great packing.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love this game! It plays like some of the best coin-op games of all time and the one finger control is wonderful!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|A little dark for really young ones but loved by older kids.  Received promptly and in great packing.  A great play on Mary Shelley characters.
0547848412|5.0|Perched atop the Gospel of John Pilate asks Jesus the question: \\"What is truth?\\"<br /><br />What Pilate meant as a taunt becomes a deadly serious question in this excellent book by Canadian author Yann Martel.<br /><br />In Life of Pi, we meet Piscene \\"Pi\\" Patel, the enigmatic son a zookeeper just about the time his father has decided to uproot his family and his zoo and take them from their native land of India to Canada for a better life.<br /><br />In a series of vignettes we meet young Pi, alternatively precocious and junvenile and adult and wise beyond his years.  Significantly however Pi is always spiritual.  In a story which brings home this point we watch as Pi tries to simultaneously become Hindu AND Moslem AND Christian, all the consternation of the respective clergy involved.<br /><br />Like his parents we smile at Pi's actions however, seeing more sincerity in Pi than in any of those purporting to instruct him.<br /><br />In the same way that all claims of piety get tested though Pi soon finds himself very tested when the ship in which he, his family and their zoo are traveling in sinks.<br /><br />It's at this point Pi does most of his story telling, explaining how he came to be a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker for companions.  Not a carefree story, Pi faces the expected challenges one might surmise from sharing a vessel with such a group of shipmates.<br /><br />Deaths occur...and they do so graphically.<br /><br />However Pi survives and 7 months later his sea story comes to an end when he finally makes land.  Up to this point readers are reminded of Earnest Hemmingway's classic Old Man and the Sea for his prose, story telling and the type of thoughts it provokes.<br /><br />At this point however Martel has a surprise for readers and it's this surprise that connects this book back to the question of truth and a promise he quoted early on...that this story would make one believe in God.<br /><br />While readers may not believe in God by the end of this book they will have a better understanding of the power of faith, the true truth if truth can actually be said to exist at all.hile readers may not believe in God by the end of this book they will have a better understanding of the power of faith, the true truth if truth can actually be said to exist at all.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The collection was a fantastic value.  I love having them all in one set and so far have not had any problems with the discs.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I just love this app! I enjoy playing this app and so does my family. It works well in my kindle and shows no problem or tells me that it is experiencing problems and that I have to exit and stop the game. I recommend other people to download this game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a former science teacher this book was compelling. Science keeps looking for the &#34;God Particle&#34;. This book may not be about the &#34;particle&#34; but it certainly is about God, from a brilliant man who previously had little or no interest in Him. Hope serious scientists have the courage to consider reading it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best sandbox game ever it beats all of these knock offs on this page and probably beats most of the apps in this store truly worth 7$
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|First of all, I must say that the people who rated this CD 3 stars or below should really open their mind and rethink what they are listening to.  An average person who listens to today's top pop 40 won't get what JT has thrown down.  Sorry, but it's the truth.<br /><br />I've been listening to Justin Timberlake's 20/20 Experience for a few weeks now and I am happy to say that the tracks on this CD are worthy of what he brought to his last CD - FutureSex/LoveSounds - if not even better.<br /><br />Whereas on \\"Justified,\\" he seemed to channel Michael Jackson and FS/LS seemed to be of a Prince influence, 20/20 is all Justin, all the time.  All the music he's made over the years, including with NSync, all seems to gel to a maturity that I wasn't ready for.<br /><br />The first track alone, \\"Pusher Love Girl\\" set the tone to incredible.  I actually thought halfway through the track that it was over, but then the vamp kicked in and took the song to a whole new level, which was already tight to begin with.  I crave to see him perform this live and on stage.<br /><br />As I progressed through \\"Suite and Tie\\" (already a bona fide hit), I am literally blindsided by what came next.  \\"Don't Hold the Wall\\" pulls from so many genres of music, I don't know how to classify it.  And maybe it needs no classification.  For me, it's out there on its own.  Clearly a dance track because I want to get up and dance 40 seconds into it, but I also want to chill while singing along.<br /><br />The track that follows is nothing short of a classic JT tune.  It's what's expected at this point in the CD.  \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" shows off his falsetto voice the best I've ever heard from him.  Of course this is just my personal opinion, but this track holds the CD together as it transcends into the next half.<br /><br />Ready for some more \\"mellow\\" JT kicks it into high gear with \\"Tunnel Vision\\".  The orchestration during the chorus caught my attention to the point where I had to replay it immediately.  Like \\"Suite & Tie\\", the lyrics are compelling and the whole melody/lyric combination is effortless.<br /><br />If there was a song that I didn't think I would care for as much it would have been \\"Spaceship Coupe.\\"  Yet again, I prove myself wrong.  Though a good song in general, it felt that the concept of the song was a little too tongue and cheeky for me, however, after listening to the instrumental vamp towards the end of the track, I became quite fond of the tune.<br /><br />And then, there's \\"That Girl.\\"  Still waiting for that mid-tempo bump and grind, that's what he delivered.  Another jam that I feel that when done live, given JT's musicianship, it will be quite impressive.<br /><br />Other Timberlake CD's at this point give you more slow jams but I guess when he put this compilation together, he wasn't finished partying because 20/20 jumps right back into another up-temp track that seems like an anthem and an ode to groovin', which makes \\"Let the Groove In\\" all the more fun to listen to.  The horns that bring in the last 3 minutes of this song sucked me in so deep that all I could do was close my eyes and become transfixed into another dimension...literally.<br /><br />\\"Mirrors,\\" the second single from the CD, is covered with synthesizer sounds and an old school slap beat that definitely shows a musical shift in Mr. Timberlake's writing abilities.  At the 5 minute, 30 second mark, when Mr. Timberlake starts to chant, \\"You are the love of my life\\" over and over, you feel it, understand it, and want it.<br /><br />The last track, \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" honestly was just too slow for me to get into.  Given the vibe of the album up to this point, it would probably have suited me more if he ended the CD with a jam, however, I understand an artist's ability to be creative and here is where JT shows another side of his talent.<br />There are two awesome \\"extra tracks\\" on the deluxe version that are really good also, Body Count and Dress On.<br /><br />Overall Igive the CD five stars.  It's been a long time since I played a CD from start to finish and enjoyed almost every track as much as I have this collection.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I hated the characters and the amount of times that they had sex.  I was so glad that she left him at the end then was<br />disappointed when I read the next books.
B00AW28HF6|4.0|Disclaimer: I received a review copy from the author. Thank you Mr. Gallagher!<br />I think some other reviewers have mentioned this too, but I absolutely adored the various locations that the author takes the reader to in this story. I am an avid traveler and I've always had a fascination with Russia ever since I started studying the language several years ago. I thought the scenes set in Russia were done very convincingly (I wouldn't know about North Korea and the Middle East, as I've never been there myself, but that was vividly described as well!) and the story was fast-paced and featured some interesting characters. I usually don't really read spy novels, so I can't boast great knowledge about other books in this genre, but it was definitely interesting. It felt very realistic.<br />I did feel that the sentence structure was a bit stilted here and there (I think it was a punctuation issue) so that could have been edited a little bit better. I'd also recommend getting a more appealing cover, because I wouldn't pick out this book in an Amazon 'line-up', so to speak - this book deserves a cool spy & terrorist cover that conveys the message better!<br />Overall, I would recommend this book to fans of action-packed spy novels, so if that's you, don't pass this one up!
B00881VLCE|1.0|The first time I got the app it was awesome. The next day though I tried but it did not work so I downloaded it again but it didn't work so I took it off completely.
B002RT5SR2|5.0|I loved the book and couldn't catch the movie on Direct TV. Streaming it was great. It kind of shocking to see the stars so young.
0486438600|5.0|the contents were full of ideas for myself to use. I have a granddaughter taking web design and can't wait to show her this book. I do art journaling and the contents are useful.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am new to this series and love it. I only wish this season was free like the previous ones for those of us who are new and trying to catch up.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|You find out just what ground action was in Iraq and how politics played a rolling in determining what fights to fight. The news media did not, except for a few instances, provide details of how battles were selected and fought.
B00933JF74|1.0|this game is horrible. i worked really hard to make a lot of progress on it when suddenly deleted everything i worked on.DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I love this movie. The writing is great, the English downplayed humor is great and the timing of the actors is impeccable. Way better than most American horror movies.
0071752854|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book. If you ever make a presentation (sales or otherwise) to another human being, this book is a must.  Lots of outstanding tips and practical how-to's.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This may be the most entertaining book I've ever read.  Couldn't stop reading once I started.  Hated it to end.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|The worst part of the movie will be waiting for the sequel, but as with the Lord of The Rings series this is expected.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Prepare to spend the next few months of your life living in the world of westeros. once you start you cant stop... luckily the 5th book is out!<br />happy reading!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The ending was a bit of a stretch, introducing as it did, the paranormal at the last minute. Not a bad read however.
B004XISI4A|5.0|this is an EPIC continuation of the awesome series.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it for anyone that enjoys fantasy.<br /><br />I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOKS!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I have been on Twitter since it began & seen it grow to where it is today.  Phenomenal!  I get most of my immediate breaking news from Twitter & have been prompted more times than I can say to visit websites or try new promotions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. I just wish that there was.more updates for it but other than tht it's really good. Huge minecraft fan
B0074EIQUG|1.0|This CD has terrible, muddled sound--like an old AM radio station.  It's also packaged in cheap cardboard, which makes me wonder whether they produced it in a cheap fashion. (Some of it sounds like a kazoo.)  I'm a long-time fan of Dr. John and New Orleans music, and  I wanted to like this album, especially after hearing rave reviews.  I had to force myself to listen to it a couple of times because I wanted to have an open mind.  I like lots of music, including some of the new music of today.  I'm trying to decide whether to just throw this CD away or donate it to Goodwill.  I don't know if it sounds terrible because of the recording process, but I'm at the point where I'm thinking of buying a turntable and returning to vinyl or buying HD tracks. It's a good thing that I live in the New Orleans area and can listen to a lot of live music.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I saw this app on my school`s website and tried all week to download it. It was worth the effort. THE BEST Bible app out there AND it`s seen on The Bible Tv show and the Bible Trivia show too!
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a great game. a lot of different quests and maps. enjoyable for all. there arengreat details and imagery.
1401923127|4.0|I am not finished with the book yet, am finding it hard to concentrate as there is a lot of science but the theory is interesting ...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a good game. I enjoy it. Must get game. Better than temple run. This game is better controls and dynamics than others.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Good story that looks like a lot of money is being spent to produce.  There seemed to be a purpose in the beginning but I am being lost in the later episodes.  Still a good story.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I really enjoy playing HO games that have an interesting and detailed story line along with more than just finding hidden objects.  This game meets both requirements and I had no problems playing it on my Kindle Fire.  The graphics were OK but could have been much better.  Accessing the hints and map is very tedious, and this and the graphics are the reasons I did not give this game five stars.  Good story with substance,  difficult but solvable puzzles and hours of play time.  It just needs more sophistication in the graphics and easier help and hint access.  Well worth the $1.25 the way it is though.  I recommend this game if you like a challenge and a game that takes some time to finishing.
0525952926|5.0|Another great book by Ken Follett.  I loved it.  Also,the price was right, the service was good and the product was excellent.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The originality of the author in this sensitively and at times poetically written novel was impressive. The point of view was completely believable, and the poignant, intricate details of a life of captivity made bearable by a loving mother made this a classic, impossible to put down book. At times, it is a thriller, at other times a profound and evocative exploration of the psychological aspects of the characters. The darkness of the premise is transformed by the love and ingenuity of the characters and their spiritual invulnerability. I didn't want this novel to end, and wanted to know the progress of wonderful Jack and his courageous mother. Truly a &#34;tour de force&#34; by a terrific (and I might add, very brave) writer, whose other work I must also read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book..easy read that keeps you wanting more. You can't help but connect to the characters. Highly recommended. Wonderful book.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Comprehensive music app with easy interface and wide access to music around the world. Makes finding and listening to what I want easy to do.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Reminds me of Space Invaders.  Very addictive- will keep playing this one!  Got this as free app of the day and couldn't be happier with it.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|Could not put this book down once I had started.<br /><br />Heartwarming and real- A great read! Felt the main character became a good friend, was very sad when it ended!
B004GYY714|5.0|I can now listen to a station that never came thru clear on my stereo. I like the choices offered.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is fantastic. The comic series it is based off is fantastic too.  There is a, instructive special feature that shows you how to play one of the songs.  Who wouldn't want that?
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|One of my favorite books now. Great story and easy to read. Really shows the bond between womanhood. I was able to see my self in the characters. This book left you thinking about the hard times in your own life but motivates you to live and appreciate the good life you already have.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love playing this game, play it several times all day long, very addicting, challenging and great design. Thanks for making this game
B005OYHF0A|5.0|Covers the basics of seams for isolating units, then provides immediately useful named techniques with examples to clarify the point!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Cannot wait until Season 4 is available for purchasing or veiwing on the Amazon Prime Instant Videos. This is an amazing series that will capativate you and pull you in.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This is the Least interesting of The James &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; trilogy. It found it to be too predictable.
B008KY6RQO|5.0|Both dark and light, gloomy and majestic, The Seer left me feeling like I witnessed something new.  I listened to some industrial rock, and thrash metal after listening to this and they seemed feeble in comparison.<br /><br />Not sure yet if i would call it the best Swans release (Great Annihilator perhaps, Holey Money too) but its definitely one of the best and at least the most solid throughout.  Not a half assed song in sight.<br /><br />My favorite is Avatar.  I really like the bells.  Sounds like some great spiritual being manifesting itself collectively in the mass of humans .<br /><br />I dont think pop music people are going to want to get near this but anyone who likes any type of rock music should acknowledge sooner or later that this one is up there with the greats (take your pick: The Doors, Beatles, Radiohead, Sonic Youth,U2, Pearl Jam, White Stripes,  the Fall and my all time fav: Einsturzende Neubauten).  Add an extra star for longevity.  M Gira and friends keep putting out good stuff for three decades plus.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is a great alarm clock app it shows the time and how long until it will go off. Also you can choose from the songs on your device for the alarm. One can make the alarm as loud as they want. You can have the alarm pause for as long as you want and to turn it off you have choices between shaking the device, doing math problems, entering a captcha, or just pushing the cancel button.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like how the game lets you interact with the horse. The complete care up to co.petitioners this an engaging app
B004KSQN7C|4.0|What can I say. It's Britney. The beats are good, The price was right. I support women in music. What more is there?
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game works fine and i love it but it reeeeeaally needs to be updated. On the pc version you can play all kinds of minigames and puzzles but not on this version. Please update very soon!!
B0050CQY1W|4.0|What can I say. It's Beyonce. The beats are good, The price was right. I support women in music. What more is there?
B00B10GYZ8|4.0|Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren are fantastic! The plot is all about the making of &#34;Psycho&#34;. Scarlett Johanson was great as Vivian Leigh.<br />It was recommended in the AARP magazine senior oscars article.<br />The price was too high. Why?
B00400NHRO|5.0|Minus the hot nurse performing the straight bendover and the gratuitous sex. There was no need to jump because there was sure to be an idiot willing to &#34;pop a cap in your ass&#34; in the parking lot.
B004GJYROG|5.0|We had this movie on VHS but my child likes it so much that it is worth buying on DVD so we can have it for the years to come.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I'm concerned that the story line tells people that if they are high on drugs, they can still perform impossibly good feats.  NOT TRUE!<br />Also there is unnecessary nudity and cursing.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to a 50-year-old, much less younger.  Yeah, it does the right thing in the end, but the wrong message was absorbed at the beginning and still doesn't get the right message across well at the end.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great Movie at a great price.  Wife loved watching this movie in the theatre and loved watching it even more at home on our blu ray player.  Definitely one of the best Bond movies lately and made the wife fall in love with the series.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|This is an interesting story and Matthew McConaughey is always good at his job and fun to watch.  I liked the book too.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV right now, the characters plot line and the way the episodes all tie together make the story gripping and leaves you wanting more!
0805086846|4.0|The product arrived in timely fashion and in excellent condition. Unfortunately, it did not contain the information that I had hoped for in my genealogical search.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved reading 'the Rosie project' and completed it in one session while travelling.<br />It's the type of book that makes you laugh out loud and want to read sections out to people sitting with you, which I did.<br />I highly recommend this book it's very well written, funny and still thought provoking.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Must buy! Great series and truly worth the cost! The special features are purely amazing and are a great addition to this set!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's an extremely well-written and twisted tale. Amazing Amy is really perfect in her own disturbing way. I highly recommend it,
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|As a guy who was in my teens in the 80s, coin-op gaming is very near & dear to my heart.  I loved the great treatment the coin-op games received and the humor/jokes surrounding said games was spot on.  Highly recommended for all ages!
B007MU85D0|4.0|I really love the whole album. Cant get the songs out of my head!  Have you seen the youtube videos?
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The acting was superb.  The special effects were realistic and part of the story.  The story and its ending actually required some thought.  If you are jaded by digital super effects with ho-hum writing and acting, you may find this one refreshing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The second season is just as good as the first. It takes us deeper into the lives of the character we fell in love with in the first season.
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|The circus performers were fine, but their talent was obscured by the dark settings, overdone special effects, mystical wierdness and quick pacing of the experience.  I invited some teenage boys in our church youth group to watch.  Two of the twelve watched until nearly the end.  Neither they nor I completed the movie due to lack of interest.  Glad we never paid to see them in Vegas.
B00BGDF1FO|4.0|Love the music! It got stuck everytime I finished a boss. Really like the instrumentals too, its a great buy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this app. my little boy loves helping me play it too. I love horses. I know it's hard work taking care of them because we have four.
B009GX6600|5.0|Have watched NCIS since the beginning. One of my favorite crime drama's on TV. This one I allow the younger members of the family to watch.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|But I love this game! Great to pick up whenever. I really would pay for this game if I had to!
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|I was so excited being that the hobbit was one of my first favorite books to read and i loved the lord of the rings trilogy movies! This however threw characters in that dont appear in the book, completely distort the events, and is the most horrible cheesiest acting (bad editing as well) that i have seen in a long time. Makes me wonder how this was even a prequel to lord of the rings! The whole movie feels rushed and unexciting  as the plot thickens. Shame on the people who made this movie and destroyed it.
B007N6NGYG|1.0|I ordered this app when it was featured by Amazon as a free app and it won't show up on my device or as ready for download.
B000GCFX3Q|5.0|I am re-reading the Walsh Family Books, since Marian Keyes is coming out with Helen's Book soon. I want be all caught up and love them!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|She has done it again. The third and final book does not disappoint. I could not have thought of a better ending myself.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is so fun I love it . but I like subway surfed oven more. but its asome I love alot
1932735410|5.0|i am a manager with 4yrs exp in management. you dont get to do everything management is about in companies.. and you dont get to limit to managerial skills either. this book helped me revisit my thoughts about what is real and correct management, and how other things that i do or learnt as skills are factually bad for management and should be unlearned.<br /><br />the book dwelves into the exam &#34;all in&#34;. but if you have experience managing people and projects, you will be able to relate and develop new thoughts that are unsaid in the book
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I will admit that this probably has not let me inner child go. I am not sure that I am completely unbiased, but I feel that the story really is adventure. I felt that every time I watched this movie I went on adventure. The score is very iconic in my memory and all the characters are great. I will admit that the special effects show their age, but I am greatful that this release was faithful to the original release. Thank you.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Cheap and just what i was looking for. I am glad I got them when I did because the price went up
B005URRCUY|4.0|It is no Brother, but still a great effort by the Black Keys. No 2 is my favorite track. Thanks.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Season one of this series was very interesting. not for younger viewers but great for folks who like to watch a well written story. Its an edgy show and will not appeal to all. Highly recommend it though. Season II the asylum is way creepier than season I

B009S33I68|5.0|I was 8 years old in 1965. I had 2 uncles who served in Vietnam. Numerous friends and associates. They've all tried telling their stories in various ways over the years. Nobody has done it as we'll as Moore and Galloway have in this book. I remember how the country treated returning veterans in the 60's and 70's. they are only now getting the respect due them. Not only will this book give you a much needed history lesson about war, and what war is in general, but more importantly about the people who are sent to fight them. The price they paid and are still paying. The price paid and still being paid by loved ones back home. The price paid and still being paid by the noncombatants in those war zones. But mostly it made me want to pay homage to the courage, brotherhood, and resiliency of those who were there. This should be required reading at all high schools throughout the country.Not just for its historical credence, but for its human psyche and insight into what is truly noble and honorable. No greater love... I remember seeing General Moore interviewed by Dan Rather prior to the release of the movie of the same title. General Moore was polite, collected, and in control as he was being interviewed by Mr Rather. I'll never forget the look in his eye as he responded to a question asked. I don't remember exactly what the question was, but I'll never forget the answer. General Moore leaned in closer and with an intense look that looked like it scared Mr Rather, responded, &#34; Hate war, but love the American warrior.&#34; I always have, I always will, and I will do so with greater understanding after having read this book. READ THIS BOOK!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|To all of the 50 Shades fans, there is life after Christian and Ana. I Iike Gideon and Eva more. I can't wait for the 3rd book in June!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Lots of fun. Keep playing just to get farther and make a few extra jumps. Graphics are so good that you feel the splash.
0684803356|5.0|My first Hemingway was Men Without Women, a collection of short stories, and I was so bored with it. After that, I pretty much put Hemingway on my black list, because if I couldn't stand his short stories, there's no way I'll get through a whole novel. Man was I wrong. I read this book based on a recommendation from a friend. All I can say is wow! This book is truly beautiful; the characters, the scenes, and all the emotions that goes with it.<br /><br />The whole story takes place in 4 days. It's about a man who's on a mission to blow up a bridge and to do so he needs to work with the local guerrillas. Each character is unique, and the all the things one man can learn about life in just 4 days.<br /><br />Definitely one of my favorite books of all time. I look forward to checking out his other novels as well.
0553801473|5.0|In my opinion, this book was just as fantasic as the rest.  So far, it has been my second favorite book in the series.  For all those reviewers who think this book drags on and doesn't advance the plot, I strongly disagree.  If you've read the first 4 books, you know that Martin does not do \\"non-stop\\" action.  He builds tension through sometimes excruciating detail to reach an eventual crecendo.  He's done this in all the books with ADWD being no different.<br /><br />The plot took big steps forward.  I won't spoil anything so I can't mention anything specific, but for some people to say \\"nothing happens\\" is just ridiculous.<br /><br />I can understand not being a fan of this book if you do not like the characters that Martin is focusing on.  Fortunately for me, Dany, Tyrion & Aria are probably my 3 favorite characters.  I also enjoy reading about the North so I find that whole plot line interesting as well.  Anytime we can keep the Cersei chapters to a minimum, I'm happy.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Like i said, just another great book by Lee Child. My brother got me hooked on the series and I started at number one and am moving through all the Jack Reacher books. Not too sure what I will do when I am done, only 5 more to go..<br /><br />If you like any of the novels with Jack in them, then this will be a hit for you too.
0062082353|5.0|What can I say about this book? As to fact of knowing Chris and have worked with him in the past, the information that is contained in this book is very enlightening and informative. I even learned some things that I did not know about Chris. RIP brother and will see you on the other side. I would recommed this book to any one wanting a good read!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Film did a great job in recreating the mood of the book. All the actors did a phenomenol job. I was highlly impressed with Emma watson's performance. She stepped out of the role of hermoine real well.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|After years of letting my fitness level slowing decrease due to inconsistent, poorly planed training and a bad diet, this book has given me renewed focus.  If you are plugged it with an email, the author will send out periodic notes of motivation and guidance.  I am stronger and leaner than I've been years and am motivated to &#34;do the work&#34;.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Excellent thriller. Suspensful and grabs you from the very beginning. You must see it from the start, don't try to come in 10 minutes late.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|This movie is hilarious!  I was not an Ashton Kutcher fan until I saw this movie.  Always enjoyed Natalie Portman.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I absolutely love this show! it's the only show on TV right now that makes be laugh right out loud and hysterically! I love the characters and can't get enough of watching it.
B0065GC0PG|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  From reading a previous review I thought it was going to be a Cinderella story but was pleased to see that was not the case
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|What a great movie for family night in! I would recommend this to anyone with kids or who likes good clean films. Thanks for the recommendation Amazon!
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|We rented this in HD last night. It took over 20 minutes to download and the picture quality was very poor. We have a high quality HD TV and we could see pixilated squares on the screen. We rent movies from Amazon all the time and this was a shock to us. There doesn't seem to be a way to request a refund.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and this one is a little different but it's still GREAT! I saw the movie first and then read the book. I would recommend this book!
B00A85EMVK|2.0|The 3 D in this movie is the worst of any 3D I've seen.<br />I guess that's what happens when you try tore do an old movie.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Even if it means staying up all night, I can not put down any book Vince Flynn has written where the main character is Mitch Rapp.  This was no exception.  Loved it!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|TRUTHFULLY, IT WAS A LOVELY EROCTIC LOVE STORY NOT A READER USUALLY BUT I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.THE  BEST.......
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I liked the book but found the symbolism difficult to understand and a bit depressing.  The first part of the book about all the animals in the zoo and their habits was fascintating.  The next part about the Japanese ship sinking and Pi left to survive for 227 days in the Pacific Ocean on a life boat with four animals was hard to comprehend.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like this game it's wavy I can't stop playing it I go to bed playing this game my baby girl like this game to
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really fun game and you get to unlock 101 games or more you should try it someday if you haven't. already.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|My friend recommended this book for me and I loved it. I am a Divergent and Hunger Games superfan! I liked the dystopian world created by Oliver. I'm reading the 2nd one now. I recommend it!

B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|Having been a David Bowie fan since \\"Space Oddity,\\" I know that his albums sometimes take multiple plays to reveal their full quality.  I have listened to \\"The Next Day\\" several times now, but I still can't understand all the accolades. Sure, it compares favorably to the recent output of many popular musical acts. However, it is a mediocre entry in the Bowie discography (akin to \\"Never Let Me Down\\" or \\"Hours...\\"), especially when compared to its most recent predecessors \\"Heathen\\" and \\"Reality.\\"  Those collections had a fairly wide variety of songs, with interesting melodies, vocal styles, and choices in instrumentation.  The production, especially in the 5.1 surround versions, was spacious and dynamic.  However, \\"The Next Day\\" sounds somewhat monotonous: many songs are very much alike, and Bowie's singing is flat and in some cases tired.<br /><br />Most disappointing is the production, mixing, and mastering, resulting in a thick, congested, consistently loud sound with minimal dynamic range and little opportunity for the musicians to show off.  As with many other albums in the past few years, it is a victim of the loudness wars.  On the plus side, the CD does sound better in a car than in a good home system, just like hit singles were made 40 years ago to sound good in car AM radios.<br /><br />It is puzzling that \\"Heathen\\" and \\"Reality\\" have superior audio quality to \\"The Next Day,\\" even though Tony Visconti produced all of them.  I hope that a remixed 5.1 surround version of \\"The Next Day\\" is being planned, given the album's success.
1449410243|5.0|I bought this for my girl friend because she is a cat lover, and she loved this book. its hilarious and i really like the art style.
B00ARAO720|4.0|Premium Rush continues the  generational redesign of genre films, in this case, the action thriller. Gordon-Levitt takes the bare bones of the category  - a strong emotional hook married to time-driven desperation, a likable hero who just happens to excel at the very thing needed beat the more powerful opposition, an appealing sig-other candidate with a need to achieve the impossible that  we're all on board with - then drops them into a blender set to 'liquefy' and artfully reconstructs this fluid race to he finish line.<br /><br />Somewhere, the ghost of Steve McQueen is smiling.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This headset is phenomenal, so prepare for the long list of amazing things it can do....<br />1. Story<br />2. Wireless capabilities<br />3. Bluetooth<br />4. Sound quality/Presets and customization<br />5. Misc<br />6. Comfort<br />7. Battery<br />8. Summary<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. I'll be honest, I originally bought the Astro A50 headset which is $50 more than these. Boy, was that a mistake. They didn't have wireless chat, they were bulky and uncomfortable, and the mic quality was horrible. I returned them the next day and got these instead. This may have been the greatest decision I've ever made!<br /><br />2. First of all, they have wireless chat and they're dual band (2.4 GHz - 5 GHz). For those who don't know what that is, that means that this headset NEVER gets interference from other wireless signals, so you'll never hear static and you'll never have your headset tethered to your controller.<br /><br />3. Second, which is what I love the most, is that you can connect your phone, iPad, or anything with bluetooth to this headset and play music or talk through it. So I can play Xbox games and listen to music, all wirelessly, at the same time! Think of these at Beats Studio headphones that are wireless. I can also take phone calls in-game without having to crouch in a corner somewhere, because the call goes straight to the headset and I can press the bluetooth button to answer it. NO OTHER HEADSET IS CAPABLE OF THIS, that I know of anyway. You can have two bluetooth devices connected at once.<br /><br />4, The sound quality is some of the best I've EVER heard. Even though it's wireless, you get the richest sounds ever, and you get AMAZING surround sound! You can customize it all too with the free sound editor from Turtle Beach, on your computer. There, you can change the voice of the headset (it talks to you to tell you when it's turning bluetooth on, changing chat types, etc.), you can raise or lower the mic gain, change ANY equalizer setting you can think of,and you can make presets for voice changers and sound modifiers. What I mean is, the headset has 8 built in sound changers like footstep booster, explosion enhancer, etc, and you can modify all of them to your liking. Then there's a button on the headset that allows you to switch through these presets while you're playing. There's also a &#34;main&#34; button so you can switch to the default setting mid-game very quickly. It also has built in voice changers (that you can change in the editor, of course) that also have a button on the headset so you can switch between them mid-game. These voices include a monster voice, and a chipmunk voice.<br /><br />5. The mic is also removable, if that matters. The wireless chat is possible because of a small bluetooth dongle that plugs into the controller. It's small, its sturdy (holds into the controller tightly), and it works well. Enough said. Oh, and it has a wheel on the front to adjust the mic monitor (the mic monitor lets you hear yourself talk so you don't accidentally yell due to the noise cancelling)<br /><br />6. They're also REALLY comfortable! There are memory foam cushions that get more comfortable as they warm up, and it's not heavy, so the top of your head no longer hurts after only an hour. Not only that but they look kind of cool too.<br /><br />7. I get about 10-12 hours of battery per charge, which is awesome! I use my 1A iPhone charger so they charge pretty quick.<br /><br />8. To sum it up, you're basically buying a headset that is 100% completely wireless. Most other &#34;wireless&#34; headsets have wireless sound, but they still require a cord to run from the headset to the controller. Not these! They are COMPLETELY customizable, they NEVER have interference/static, they have dual bluetooth pairing, they have amazing sound quality, there are buttons to change your voice/change your game sound mid-game, they're comfortable, they have a great battery, and they just look cool. So if you're debating betweenthe Astros or these, these win by a long shot. This also comes with a 12' USB charging cable, which is nice. It just uses mini USB, so can also use your own cords (I thinks it's mini USB. All I know is that it's the kind that connects to something like a PSP). There are many other great things about this headset, but you'd be reading for another hour, so hopefully what I've pointed out has helped!<br /><br />Cons:<br />There's a bit of a learning curve with learning how to use all the buttons on the headset. It's a short learning curve, but it's there.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Yes, I &#34;liked&#34; it.  Lots of twists and turns.  It certainly doesn't make you like the characters. I did feel it ended at the right spot
B000AP04NI|5.0|This movie is just a good as when I saw it many years ago!  I absolutely loved it then as I do now!  I would say this is just under The Sound Of Music.  I am a huge sound if music fan!!!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I love nearly all the movies that Patrick Swayze has done in his career but this was one of the very best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun i would recommend this  to some of my friends and tell them how fun it is
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow...I didn't see the 50% mark coming at all.  What a head #$%&!!!<br /><br />These people are truly sick.  Book is well written and interesting, but I could have used the mind space this book occupied for SO MANY other productive things.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Been a fan all my life and I really feel his music now is better than ever. The words and music really are some of his best work
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Having studied Japanese history I enjoy martial arts films.  This is a well crafted and detailed account of Japanese life.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved all the characters and the descriptions of Ireland.  A very moving story about a sad and lonely man who really never had much of a life.  Thank goodness it ended happily.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|It was a unique film and the ending was a surprise.  The cinematography was amazing.  This was an excellent film
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fun!  Fun!  Fun!  Easy to use!  A great game!  We'll be coming back for more of thier games.  Thank you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it.! The only problem is the buttons always take awile to load. Other than that its awesome. GREAT.!
B004T4LUPW|3.0|I only chose 3 stars because I am trying this out to see if it is useful to me, I am sure I will know better in a few weeks if this is a keeper.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like that I can have this on my kindle so wear ever I go I can check my Facebook!!!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This book was great. It kept me interested thee entire time. I thought toward the end it got a bit off-topic with the theme. I would have liked a different last quarter of the book. Other than that, I really enjoyed it!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I followed the instructions line-for-line and found it very helpful, however I wasted a lot of time before I figured out that some of the instructions for &#34;click&#34; should have been &#34;double-click&#34;. i.e. Browse for Book needs to be a double-click.<br />Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone wanting to wanting to publish on Amazon.<br />I'm still having trouble with the TOC, but I have a feeling it's &#34;operator trouble&#34;, not a problem with the instructions!<br />Thanks<br />Dee Morgan
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Great album of course, would you expect anything else from Rod Stewart. It is amazing how his voice has held up for all these years.
B009178OQA|4.0|Like the subject, itself, the best sushi in Tokyo, this documentary builds its exploration with great detail and fine quality. It was a pleasure to see.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This honestly is the best game I have played in awhile and its on the go so that's a very big +! I like it how they added a helicopter to the bankers so much fun to play and as I'm typing this I think about how I could be playing so bye<br /><br />And that's my review of the best game on my kindle fire HD<br />(Also If I had to I would buy it twice) :P
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very responsive and all levels Are a challenge. I use the very hard levels to play on. Makes me think of Old times in Arcades, costing only a Quarter.
B008476HBM|2.0|I found this book to be along the same line as Sense and Sensibility. As a Christian that desires to fill my mind with profitable reading, reading that builds character, this is not a book I would want to fill my thoughts with. I did not even finish the book because of that.
B001F290E4|4.0|I like this CD but am partial to the soul 2, you dont have to have this one in order to have the soul 2.
B007SXB498|2.0|This book has some good aspects and is definitely entertaining. But there is too much romance dramatics for me. I do not like this style of book even though it may be a classic.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Excellent movie, realistic, shocking, funny and surprising.  Although I purchsed a used CD, it was like new, a clear picture, good sound and nobody walking across the screen with popcorn in their hand (if you know what I mean).  I've purchased lots of movies this way and will continue to do so.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show. Unexpectedly so  I just can't wait until I can get season three through prime. This is part of the reason I left Netflix
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|My son loves this book. Can not wait to get the next one. Brilliant writing. love the pictures too. Just a really good kids book.
B00204AA0O|5.0|Regina nunca falla. Simplemente eso, no falla. Maravillosas y puras canciones que llegan al alma, con una voz privilegiada. Gracias por componer esta genialidad.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|&#34;The Racketeer&#34; is Grisham at his best. The story flows well and is extremely believable, reminiscent of &#34;The Firm&#34; and &#34;The Pelican Brief&#34;.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|An excellent book, with the same quality and quirky style of the other Vorkosigan books.  It is wonderful to have another book out from this series.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This really is a fun game. It has great pacing to it plus it doesn't play too hard and not easy. Enemies line up you shoot em but still challenging
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I liked the fact that it was a quick read and it did have some life lesson about the time we have here on earth. I didn't really care for the characters and didn't feel a connection to them. This book lacked in comparison to other Mitch albums books. The first half of the book was hard to be in to and I took a few months off before going back and reading the rest. The second half of the book was much better but still disappointed with the story......I wouldn't really recommend it.
143353083X|5.0|I am satisfied with the book. It's comprehensive (&#34;like a 20 volume commentary&#34;) and biblical.<br />It was not mentioned, that personal size not only means that it's smaller but also that it misses some special chapters. However, it is accessible online with the codes given to the book.
B000WN60NG|4.0|If blues music is your thing then you will love this movie. The story line is a bit bizarre but the music is outstanding. A must see for blues lovers.
B009C7JS14|4.0|While I found this app pretty I prefer Weather Bug because it shows you the forecast for the next few days easily other than just the present day. So while it's not terrible or malfunctioning there are better apps.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I was surprised I actually liked this book so much. I usually prefer thriller/mysteries so when this came up in my book club, I thought I would hate it. I ended up reading the whole book in one day! Although it was extremely sad (seriously, kids with cancer...), it was a good story with interesting characters.
B004MKM8L8|4.0|I love all the Harry Potter Movies and this one is no exception.<br />Recommend this highly to all HP fans!
0374275637|5.0|This book gets into how people as a whole make decisions, why mental shortucts that serve us beautifully most of the time, can lead us into mistakes if we do not take the time to understand why we think the way we do, and how best to handle decision making.  It also looks into choice architectures that are set up and how we are often nudged into certian decisions.  (sometimes for the better - but knowing the process helps you to defend when it isnt in your best interest).  Great book, and worthwhile read.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The beauty of this book is that it doesn't dramatize or over glamorize the situation to make the DEVGRU team appear like some Hollywood version of the seals. It's very interesting however I did find some sections that were a lot slower and far less intriguing. Don't expect an all out action book from no easy day. Expect a brave book that will inform you and simply give you the details it can of one of the most elite teams in the world.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Seriously this series of books is great.  It is almost like watching a longer episode, the dialoge is great, the characters are almost right from the TV show, but there are enough differences in thier actions, thoughts etc... that you can fully emerse yourself in the fictionalized version of Richard Castle's imagination (of course from the fictional TV show).  Great works, they build greatly as a series... but READ THEM IN ORDER.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I haven't loved a book so much in many years that compelled me to reread it immediately.<br />As soon as I finished the last page, I turned back to the first.  In fact, I'm considering reading it a third time.<br /><br />The plot is so amazing, and the characters so beautifully detailed that I could not get enough.<br /><br />Hoover is so gifted in her understanding of her characters, the circumstances that bring them together, and the way they intertwine.  I have read her other 2 and am awaiting the next.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading World Without Ene (Rhe Pillers of the Faith) and have recomender it to many of my friends.
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|I feel like this is a great idea to use Oz but the graphics aren't that great (especially when compared to that of Temple Run 2.) I feel like this one is easier too compared to the others. It's okay but as it stands I would rather be playing Temple Run 2 or Temple Run: Brave long before I play this.
B000WZONL0|5.0|The visual quality, the scenery, the message is inspirational about how a group of people led by a determined indivdual can change society.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Once again, I downloaded this app because it was free. It is very addictive and I enjoy playing it and trying to get the highest score.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|My family and I like the characters in this series as well as the way it is made and the quality of entertainment it provides. Great series over all!
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I originally bought this movie at my oldest son's request. I watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it, as did my son. I would recommend this to anyone who likes scary, suspenseful movies with surprise endings!!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Not sure if Daniel Craig will be back or not, but he is still enjoyable to watch as Bond. Movie contains the usual action and gratuitous sex scenes plus a couple of things from the past.
B0068FYZSE|5.0|The plot in this dance and feel good film is beside the point.  The music is great, the dancing is even better and at the apex of excellence is Jessica Alba, as luscious a treat of feminine delight as the (male) mind can imagine. I'm 70 years old, but this movie makes me feel 20!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I wasn't sure if this was my kind of game. I opened it to check it out and had the funniest time. I enjoy searching things out and the interaction of the guests was remarkable.  I highly recommend this game. you can play a little bit or for a while. it stays in time with you. Give it a shot you can always uninstall the. game.
B0050R0XPA|4.0|Very quick to build; 800 pieces doesn't take that long.<br /><br />The gazebo was interesting to see how it came together, but once it was done it looks very nice.<br />The mail truck is fun, rolls great, the snowshoes sticking to it though makes it pretty difficult to remove though.<br />The post office itself is pretty fun, the light up brick is easy to get to and hopefully just as easy to replace the battery on.  It does add a lot of character to the building.<br /><br />Most difficult part is the roof on the building.  Constructing it is easy, attaching it to the building itself is another story.  As an adult, it was easy to figure out the best way to accomplish building it.  For a child though?  I can see some frustration happening.<br /><br />I bought this product on Amazon, but it was fulfilled by another company.  I was not pleased at all with the packaging used, the product was just tossed in a box and it was barely sealed.  None of Amazon's trademarked wonderful plastic air packs were used.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the game.Makes you concentrate. Great mind game.<br />I have a simular game on my home computer play it all the time<br />when I'm not using my Ipod.I would recomend it to age<br />5 and up.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Not what I expected!  Great movie with a great twist!  I have recommend it to almost every one I know!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It's Downton Abbey - what else needs to be said.  I guess only that I wish it were longer and I can't wait for the next 10 seasons!!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app has lots of sounds, and lots of different features.  Would highly recommend for the kindle fire.  Very relaxing.
030758836X|3.0|Read this in a weekend. Certainly a page-turner. Well-written in some ways, badly written in others. Seemed to me that Nick and Amy had the same \\"voice,\\" there was no distinction except for the chapter headings as to who was speaking. There were many clever observations and turns of phrases, but they BOTH made them, and they're often recycled.<br /><br />\\"the Internet was still some exotic pet kept in the corner of the publishing world - throw some kibble at it, watch it dance on its little leash, oh quite cute, it definitely won't kill us in the night.\\" (Nick)<br /><br />\\"we sometimes laugh, laugh out loud, at the horrible tings women make their husbands do to prove their love. The pointless tasks, the myriad surrenders. We call these men the dancing monkeys.\\" (Amy)<br /><br />As a villain, Amy was much too Superheroic. Every time she got into trouble, she managed to squirm (or stab) her way out of it, without paying too dear a price. And then the ending - 39 year old, coming from a mother with a history of miscarriage can easily get preggers from a couple vials of frozen sperm and possibly hubs' private consolation Kleenexes? I ain't buying it.<br /><br />Nick was just as devious as Amy was, he simply wasn't as good at it.<br /><br />I ended up disliking both characters intensely, and the further I've gotten from finishing the novel, the more I feel it is very clever, on the surface, but not particularly deep.
1588167461|4.0|I first purchased this book for my brother but as I start a job search I wanted a good reference for what the most versatile articles of clothing are for a man.  For example I didn't know if a gray suit or a navy suit would be usable in more situations.  It covers a good variety of topics, and yes you could probably find similar material online, but sometimes it's nice to have a hand reference.  That said there are a couple of topics that I don't think it addresses in sufficient detail (shaving, grooming) and a few where its recommendations stray (packing?, it would have you pack probably twice what you need).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story drew me in immediately and didn't let go until the end! I love the development of the characters and how the plot ties everything together. It was a great read that I will recommend and most likely reread! Holder is an amazing character and I couldn't get enough!
B005LL4U54|3.0|There is nothing wrong with this product but I thought I ordered the movie and not interested in the soundtrack.
1449410243|5.0|I have read excerpts to all my cat loving friends and thoroughly enjoy reading this book. I haven't read any of it to my cat though, don't want her to get any new ideas or know that I am actually on to her.
159562015X|3.0|If you want to find out which of your strengths to improve on, and how to bring out the best in people you work with, you should read this book.  I found this book easy to read, and the list of 34 strengths helpful.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I still think this is Jennifer Lawrence's best performance,  but I wouldn't disagree if someone insisted Silver Linings Playbook was better.  She portrays a girl who is the only true adult in the entire community,  and considering the fact that she was just a kid herself when she did this movie,  surely some of it had to be great acting not just a girl ahead of her years.
0316010669|4.0|I read this book a few years ago, and was amazed at the variety of fields the research was drawn from.  I did find a couple of sections boring, but other than that I found this book to be excellent.  It is brief and easy to read, and I would read it again.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|The well written and easy understandable writing of Richard Dawkins helped me for once and for all to settle whichever &#34;embarrasing&#34; question I might have had regarding the universe at an age of 30. The problem for me as a kid and probably other kids aswell is that it might be difficult to understand sicence text books, but Richard so masterly manages to explain science in a universal language helping us to understand more, even us the grown ups can learn a lot by reading this book. I will definately encourage my kids to read it once they are old enough.<br />To sum it up the book was a pleasure to read from beginning to end and has a lot to offer any young aspiring scientist.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|One of the best series I have ever seen. I would recommend this to all my adult friends. Is a can't wait to see what comes next series.
1609611543|5.0|Filled with great info that is TRUE! Stay away from grains and be healthier,  thinner and have better blood work.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great game, my family and I play. We also play on the Wii . A good family game.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|English is not my first language so I like easy reads. But this is one way too easy. characters and plot are very superficial. Think about this book as the complete opposite of Game of Thrones.
B00122HT04|5.0|All the songs are so unique and have such a cool sound. This is one of my favorite Avenged Sevenfold albums as well as one of my favorites in general. It's hard to think of another album with so much variety that still sounds like one band.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|This CD is one that is definitely a collector's item.  I'll have to guard it so no one will steal it.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I thought this was very well done and loved the message.<br /><br />I just think everyone could use more exposure to the arts. This is not an easy show to pull off...it is sung from start to finish.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|For readers unfamiliar with Arthur C. Clarke there is no way to describe his place in the pantheon of science fiction writers during the 50's and 60's.  Along with authors like Heinlein, Asimov, and Farmer, he shaped the genre and originated many themes still playing today.  One such is the 'end of humanity as you know it' story.<br /><br />Childhood's End is an imaginative and compelling tale that appeared when aliens from outer space were mostly still portrayed in the Orwellian mode - invading and attempting to subjugate earth until defeated by anything from germs to ray guns.  Clarke's book took an entirely different approach.  While the aliens in Childhood's End are mysterious and all-powerful, they seem to have no objective other than to benefit earth (and they don't carry cookbooks titled How to Serve Man!).  Only as the book draws to its end do we discover, along with the rest of earth, what their real motives are.<br /><br />Clark is often criticized as more focused on the technical descriptions in his books than on character development and that is probably fair.  You will not fall in love with any one character nor will you likely laugh out loud at the witty dialogue.  There are no battles or thundering explosions for the action-dependent.  What you will do is find yourself fascinated by the imagination and expertise that runs throughout the book.  You will see the scientist turned visionary and storyteller (remember that Clarke is given credit as the man who first proposed communication satellites).  This is a big tale, well told, and one I am surprised that no one has made into a movie such as 2001 A Space Odyssey.  You will put this book down at the end and say, \\"Wow\\" and feel just a little sad.  And if you like this one, let me recommend The City and The Stars (also titled Against the Fall of Night).  It's even better.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|If you saw Gran Torino you'd think you were watching it again, Clint Eastwood played the scrappy old guy again.  But it shows how family must stick together and how much you get from your parents even when they don't think your paying attention.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I felt this was a great addition to the LOTR movies.  The tale was told in a very comprehensive way.  It must be received as it is, a story on its own, separate from the previous trilogy. The only difficulty in the story telling was differentiating the dwarves because there was an introduction to so many at once and the similarities between them all.  Ian McKellan was great as an earlier version of Gandalf and the casting of Bilbo was wonderful with Mr Freeman.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the beginning book of the series.  It is a must-read.  One of my favorite books.  Good character development, well-developed plot, good dialogue.  Great ideas.
B00127RAJY|1.0|There are three different segments, each progressively harder.  Unlike some of my other Jillian Michael's CDs, there is no way to skip the intro everytime you start the CD, so no matter which program you are on, you waste 5 minutes each and every time,  Also, many of the same exercises that are on &#34;Ripped in 30&#34;.  I was looking for new routines.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the best book that I read in 2012.  I don't know if that means it was a great book or that I need to improve my reading list!
B000E9910W|3.0|It made me realize how every song sounds the same.  I purchased the CD to reaquaint myself before a concert.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great series.  Looking forward to seeing the movie.  Very interesting reading to just escape into a fantasy world.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book is amazing because Frances Hodgson Burnett used  a  perfect  word  choice!!!<br />I really recommend this great book !!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A friend said I had to read these.  What a waste!  I read about 50 pages and got grossed out.  The writing is pathetic.  The sexual parts are gross.  The poor &#34;heroine&#34; is an idiot.  I don't want to waste my time since I already wasted my money.
B00BESM14U|4.0|This is a really well done movie. Good story, good acting, and it's one of those rare movies that a guy can watch with a date and both be entertained. If you like the &#34;coming of age&#34; movies, you'll really enjoy this one. You'd probably be better off watching something else if homosexual side plots make you uncomfortable. The &#34;gay thing&#34; is not shoved down your throat like in Brokeback Mountain, but the film doesn't shy away from the issue either.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is the best freecell app.  I don't know which is the one I bought (one is free), but the free one and the bought one are excellent.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so fun for the whole family!  My 3 year old can even play it!  Really easy to install and learn to play.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the third of the series and not the least.  The writing is well-developed with good characters, good dialogue, intrigue, and just good escaping into a fantasy world.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie is trash..the actors have overdone the dirty jokes..no decency at all.<br />Life isn't only about sex you morons!!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|What a great album.  These guys just have a sound that you get hooked on.  They kind of remind me of Alice in Chains...
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book opened my eyes to so many different things in life that we dare not think about and this book will open your eyes. This book is beautifully moving and inspiring i would recommend it to everybody.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This is the science fiction series if you like your stories with a moral.  The characters are detailed and interesting with subtleties.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|Very confusing usage.  No real instructions given.  Not sure i will keep it as an app.  I really don't like it
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Of course, after her Gone Girl, it is hard to match that!  However, this is a finely written piece of work and well worth reading.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I have removed this demo from my aps.  Didn't like it at all.  Just not my style.  Maybe not games fault.  could just be me.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Its more about a man's struggle with alcoholism than anything, but if you watch to the end it will be worth your time.
B0063M22QO|2.0|It is very boring.  Not enough to it.<br />Doesn't hold my interest. may delete it from my apps. Have had better.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Its too bad this show isn't on the air anymore.  Its charming characters and interesting stories out class most sci-fi's on the air today.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Hey I love this game but it good money so please make this game be free.so that's  all I got to say
B009AJDDQU|4.0|I chose this rating because I am a huge Alien fan. I purchased the 3D version of the movie and it was incredible. I would recommend this movie to all Alien fans but honestly the movie can stand alone just on it's own merits without anyone having seen all of the previous Alien movies.
B00992CF6W|4.0|First of all it is a wimpy version of minecraft because I've played minecraft on the computer and this game does not have everything that the computer game has. it does not have bucket of water or cake or maps and the blue flowers are supposed to be red. I can't fit all of the flaws but I hope that they will have mods and make it more like the computer minecraft then I will give it f five stars.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|I do recommend and love this game. The graphics are incredible. The game itself is nerve-wracking. Trying to maneuver 4 trains to their stations without crashing into one another is certainly a challenge. Takes patience but is a &#34;train-load&#34; of fun.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It's pretty fun, great controls, cool graphics, definitely recommend this to any racing fan. I play it in my free time. Five out of Five.
B002ZE85YW|4.0|Love the entire Terminator series and this one is just as good. Well of course the first 2 are by far the best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is awesome you get to compete . You get to dress feed play with your horse. It is so much fun
B00B99KJR0|3.0|So far the game is just matching 3 similar items in a row in order to clear the board and allow pieces of objects to fall off the bottom of the board in order to clear the round. I really do hope that the game expands more as just matching 3 items would be rather boring.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Loved it! A great movie with endearing characters and a deftly-handled plot. Worth watching more than once. Great casting and great directing, not to mention a fantastic soundtrack.
0062209493|4.0|Enjoyed the content, it presentation and the moment by moment account of the various engagements. Chris is a true american hero
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I'm almost glad this book turned out as it did. I was really tired of some of the back-and-forth parts of this series, and was happy for some resolution.
B00000K3D4|5.0|It's a dvd, it works.  That's it.  There's not really much else that can be said about a dvd.  Yay!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great! It really helped flesh out the series, adding a lot to the story. Can't wait for the next one.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|This is a really compelling show, I wanted to find out what happened next after every episode. Good DVD extras too. I like the commentaries.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and look forward to the rest of the series. It will be a great book to read to my kids when they get a little older.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A historical novel that has a different and original view of death. Very enjoyable read, real characters.  I am about to start another book by Markus Zusak.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i like to keep a hand calculator nearby.  when traveling i carry this calculator on my fire.  now this app is just as handy.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like books by Nicholas Sparks.  Well written and moves well,  I like his writings as they tend to have a really good story line.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|This was a hard read in the asspect of how humans are treated in North Korea very disgusting place to be. A good story of human endurance.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a fun game.  It works well even if you are not feeling well but keeps you intertained.  Does well while waiting for appointments.
B0039UTDFG|5.0|Amazing
B003TSEEDY|4.0|All the characters are complex and interesting and this tale of adolescent life drew me in and kept me reading. I really liked the main character, a male high-school freshman, which is interesting because I am female and well past his age. The only part I didn't like was the Aunt Helen theme. Won't elaborate as that could be a spoiler. But I think the story could have stood on its own without that.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Enjoyed the game.  Would buy from G5 again. Graphics and theme were fun. I didn't run into any of the problems the other reviewers experienced.
0316017930|5.0|Fantastic book. Talks about success in a way where you dont feel you have been failing all your life. So the stories and characters are great. It is not one of those I told you so books it actually teaches through its stories.
B009ANP4F4|1.0|Going to return for another one.. this one wont play.. it has blocks all over it and u can't understand or tell what the icture is like.. Hopefully next one is perfect..
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Love it; you want to never puted down.<br />It is realy fun.<br />You want the challenge.<br />you forget you have to work the next day.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Wonderful Voice and Wonderful Music. Listening with headphones will take you on a journey you won't want to come back from.
B001K3ENEA|5.0|There's a list of pros and cons at the end of this review to sum things up, if you don't want to read in detail:<br /><br />First off, let's start with my first impressions. Immediately, taking these out of the box, I thought these felt cheap. Of course they are cheap headphones, none of this means they are really CHEAP cheap. I thought they felt flimsy, but now I would say they're just flexible. Then I thought they were EXTREMELY light. Now after some comparisons with my friends' headphones, I concluded that this is a REALLY good thing. You almost don't feel these on your head. I also noticed the auto-adjustable band, which I didn't like, still don't like,  but you learn to live with it. I also noticed the thicker wire, which is really great, since I usually bend it a lot, and it makes for a sturdier connection. Also the wire is LONG, I have no problem hooking these up to my guitar amp and walking around with them on. In addition, they come with a 1/8&#34; to 1/4&#34; adapter for those of you who may need it. Finally, I did not like the cushioning used, it's that kind of fake leather that's really cold, and if you keep these on for a while, you'll feel it when you take them off. It's not fabric, so it doesn't contain your sweat(if you sweat) and this is especially troublesome when it's cold out.<br /><br />Now the audio quality. Listening to these flat, they sounded like a normal pair of cheap, plastic headphones. Unbalanced, high mids, muffled highs, and normal bass. So no, these aren't perfect the way they are, BUT that still doesn't mean they're not good. After all, I am the kind of guy who LOVES to mess with the EQ settings on all my music. I do not regret getting these headphones, they handle ALL the EQ adjustments I throw at it. You can literally make these sound just the way you want. Whether you're a bass-head, or not, these will adjust with a proper EQ. I would suggest scooping out the mids in the 600-1.2k range, and boosting the highs above 10k, and depending on how you like your bass, nudge up the 30-250 range a bit. These things are amazing. Crystal quality output. Last thing about the audio, these things get LOUD. I would not recommend listening to your music at max volume with these, the ear cups are shallow, so the speakers are relatively close to your ears, and I tested out the dB output that close, at ~90% it's above 87dB, which will damage your hearing if you listen to music at that volume for more than a couple hours. Be smart when using these, if you're gonna be somewhere loud, use earbuds, these headphones don't block all the outside noise. Which is a downside, but if you're walking around, it's worth having the ability to hear your music, and your surroundings.<br /><br />I am very happy with my purchase. I love these headphones, they are great. A friend of mine tested them out and he concluded that these are better than beats. And at a fraction of the cost. Now to recap, here's a list of the pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros<br />-Small and lightweight<br />-Over-ear(relatively good isolation, and allows outside noise in a bit)<br />-Comfortable<br />-Works great with EQ adjustments<br />-Loud output(even tested boosted signal, and goes way beyond what you'd expect)<br />-Clear Quality<br />-Handles Bass Boosters well<br />-Thicker wire<br />-Comes with 1/8&#34; to 1/4&#34; adapter<br />-Flexible<br /><br />Cons(Sacrifices)<br />-Auto-adjustable band(uncomfortable around neck)<br />-Flat sound is unbalanced<br />-Let's in some outside noise(not always bad)<br />-Cold material for cushioning(doesn't contain sweat well)<br />-No swiveling, or twisting of the ear cups :(<br />-Feels like cheap plastic(it's sturdy though)<br /><br />5 Stars for having all my mandatory requirements annihilated: Works with EQ, Small and lightweight, Over-ear, Clear quality
B000JMKNV0|2.0|Although this book was an attempt to get into the readers head and play with it, it didn't work with me.  I was not impressed with how a twisted mind works.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Wow is all I can say. A cold spring, man that's not cool. when will we get the spring weather. Hope Easter will be a good one.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|I installed this app because it intrigued me, as i suspected though, this app is nothing more than a novelty. Checked against four networks with known passwords, did not unlock any. Also noticed extra app icons adding themselves to my home screen. Useless app that does nothing but install ad-ware.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|One of the best masterpiece series ever. The acting is fabulous, not a weak one in the bunch. The characters are wonderful and the plot is intriguing as well as educational. Thoroughly enjoyable!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Simply addicting. I've beaten the game on PC and Xbox, still enjoying going through it again on mobile, great port. Cant wait for 2 to release!
B001SKB1Y0|4.0|Very sensual movie. Enjoyable to watch! All of the lead actors play their roles superbly and the two female leads are perfect
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Awesome. Brilliant. Many have been the cinematic adaptations of Victor Hugo's classic \\"Les Misérables,\\" and for good reason. This is a powerful, moral story that needs to be kept alive for generations to come. But what it makes it much risky as a film, given the current trend in audiences' tastes, is to make it a musical. And that is precisely what director Tom Hooper did. The result is just fantastic, grandiose, unforgettable, and one for the ages.<br /><br />The story begins in 1815, where we are told that \\"twenty six years after the start of the French revolution, a king is once again on the throne of France.\\" Right away we watch the now famous scene in which Jean Valjean (an unrecognizable Hugh Jackman) and hundreds of fellow prisoners are painfully pushing a gigantic ship into an empty dock, under the unmerciful surveillance of ruthless policeman Javert (Russell Crowe). Once the day is over and the huge task completed, Valjean is finally granted his freedom, being labeled \\"a dangerous man, on parole forever.\\" His crime: stealing a loaf of bread years ago, to feed his sister's son. Fast forward to 1823, and we find Valjean as a successful business man, who owns a factory where they manufacture religious artifacts - he was helped by a priest during his days after release. Unbeknown to him, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), one of the workers at the factory, was fired because she was pregnant. Sadly, she became a prostitute afterward, under the eyes of lowlifes Thénardier (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Madame Thénardier (Helena Bonham Carter). While she works, the Thénardiers have her daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen) also working as a slave under very unsanitary conditions. Sadly, Fantine dies, and Valjean, remorsefully, decides to take care of Cosette. Sadly, too, Javert shows up and finds out that Valjean is around, so he goes after him with a vengeance. We then move on to 1832, when a revolution is boiling in Paris, were the poor are fighting the rich. We now find Cosettegrown up (this time played by Amanda Seyfried), and, while her father is trying to evade Javert during some turmoil, she catches the eye of Marius (Eddie Redmayne), a well-to-do young man who happens to be involved in the revolutionary movement, but in favor of the poor. Javert, meanwhile and more than ever, is trying to capture Valjean at any cost.<br /><br />Whether or not you like musicals - and I don't, for most part --, you'll surely embrace \\"Les Misérables,\\" even though 95% of the dialogue is done by singing. Everything works: the acting, the cinematography, the music, the production design, and, of course, the unforgettable and timeless story. The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital copy edition is awesome as well, loaded with extras, with features about the stars, locations, music, production design, commentary by director Hooper, and more. Needles to say, the film was nominated for 8 Academy Awards, and won 3 Golden Globe Awards. (USA/UK, 2012, color, 158 mins plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on March 25, 2013 by Eric Gonzales for Universal Blu-ray
B0041CGP02|5.0|This has almost all of his old songs and there are a lot.  I am very pleased with it. 5 stars.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Well when this game first came out I was hooked. But since then so many better games have taken its place.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it because I can win a lot even with the &#34;Random Deals&#34; instead of the &#34;Winning Deals&#34; .
0345803485|5.0|Yes, there is erotica and yes the writing can be downright elementary (sure wish the author had better editors) but, the bottom line, the book reflects what women truly and deeply want in a relationship: someone who loves them and will care of them and has the means to do it. Being cherished and showered with gifts by someone that you can count on. Someone who will be there for you in good times and in bad, that is what counts. The erotica makes the book interesting; however, the reason older women are reading these books in legion is that the author takes them away to a life they wish they could have - a life they've missed and now cannot possess.<br /><br />I read the book, and it brought back to me several of the relationships I had in my youth. The comfort of a partner who would care for all of my needs without me lifting a finger. An attentive lover who was curious and who encouraged healthy curiosity into the world of erotica. Most women want a knight to ride into their lives on a white horse. With Christian Grey, you get the black knight but, oh, what a ride you'll have.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It's ok, but you have no control hardly with which way the coins go to be able to get any bonus's with it or to even get a lot of points.  This game requires real money to keep playing for any length of time unless you get super lucky.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A nice little story and a good read for on the train going home from work, would be happy to read more from this author
B0034DGPEU|4.0|...had the writer not so rushed the ending.  That said, However, a fascinating read that kept me turning the pages!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when my friend told me about this show. I figured it can't be that good, it only made 1 season. After watching the first couple episodes, I was hooked. I came to find out Fox set the show up for failure. I can't say I'm surprised. I hope Amazon with the success of their first show picks this up and continues where the movie Serenity left off!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a terrific movie.  I remember well the events and I knew how it ended,but it was still riveting beginning to end.
B0076DELIG|5.0|If you need any evidence why this man is one of the rgeat police procedural writers of our time, check out this sterling edition to his remarkable body of work.
B00005JKDR|5.0|We had lost our old one and I wanted this for my 3 year old. Couldn't be without this one.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Nice premise, but it falls like so many grisham books into a near ennui. not the worst book out there, but far from the best,.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A very fun and addicting game. Can't stop playing this game  I would recommend it to anyone. Yes there is some actual purchasing with real money in the game.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Truly enjoyed this book. Well developed, well written, in short a joy to read. I can't wait for the next book!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I enjoy it in my down time.  I'm no chess master.  I only know all the moves, sometimes the Android wins sometimes I win. I wanted something in which I could play by myself and this certainly fits the bill.  Thanks
B00030DEQE|1.0|I have a small form computer so that's the reason I bought this adapter. Well it came with a small form bracket but it didn't line up with the holes on the card, making the adapter useless for me! Total waste.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I travel quite a lot and need a resource for checking the weather conditions in various locations. This filled the need admirably.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Great rendition of Emma with fine actors, great cinematography and score. All around great work and one I can't help watching every year at least. For the Jane Austin fan and those who enjoy British or period film.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I travel extensively and this app has been great for use as an alarm clock! It beats wake up calls!
B002GJT4XM|5.0|Have watched this three times since I got it and all the EXTRAS! Great buy! I have read all the books.Read the  books<br />then watch the movie, when you read the second book the characters will come alive right at you!
B002M9LEDO|5.0|I owned this as a CD when I was in high school and always thought this was an amazing album. It still holds up to the test of time 20 years later and I still listen to this daily.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I discovered Walking Dead in the third season. I thought that it couldn't possibly be a show that I would like. Was I ever wrong! (I am a Downton Abbey, Jane Austen, Masterpiece Theater, Homeland, and The Good Wife type of fan.) This show is not just about blood and gore. It's more about people, relationships, hope, endurance, survival, and faith. I bought Season 1 and Season 2 to catch up and get all the back histories of the characters and situations. It's incredible. I watch it on my Kindle when I am working out at the gym, and it keeps me going for at least 45 minutes on the elliptical. The biggest problem is that I embarrass myself by gasping and covering my mouth involuntarily while at the gym. (It is scary!) I highly recommend this show, and it is great watching it on my Kindle.
B003A97Z88|5.0|Just another really amazing album by Manowar. This album and Triumph of Steel are must haves if you like any sort of metal music. Absolutely excellent and I listen to it daily.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|There isn't a whole lot to say about this bag.  It accommodates my Micro 4:3 Olympus PEN with room to spare quite nicely.  Larger cameras are going to fit more snugly to be certain but the bag works well for cameras of just about any size.  My only small gripe with the bag is that there isn't a rain jacket included.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I am a fan of Josh Groban and have most of his albums, but this one was a disappointment.  I could not relate to the songs.  They seemed too off the wall and none stood out as something I would like to hear over and over.  This one was a waste of my money.  I hope the next one will be better, I love the sound of his voice.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I grew up in apartheid South Africa and listening to Rodriguez was very much part of the counter-culture.<br /><br />This story is also an amazing role reversal. Usually, you expect something like a top international star \\"finds\\" someone in a smaller country like South Africa, and rescues them from obscurity. For example, Ladysmith Black Mambaza were a great act in South Africa, with a huge domestic following but unknown internationally, and Paul Simon projected them onto the international stage. Here we find a brilliant US performer, ripped off by his record label and consigned to obscurity, rescued by his popularity in South Africa. This guy with the right promotion could have rivalled Dylan.<br /><br />To put it into perspective, his music mostly sold to white South Africa, a market of at most 4 million, and he sold half a million albums. In the US, that would be like selling 25-million.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour: listen to some samples at your favouring online music store. Then get the video and buy the music. There's a magic not only to the lyrics but to his sound. And his character as revealed by the movie is a revelation: totally unspoilt by the sudden catapult to relative fame and fortune when \\"discovered\\" in post-apartheid South Africa. You also pick up a little of the flavour of the underground anti-apartheid culture of the time, though the movie does not harp on that.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a story of an ordinary man livi g what seems to be an ordinary life until he gets a letter from an old, dying colleague. He sets out on a journey to see her, willing her to live until he walks the entire 500 miles to her hospice. Along the way he comes to terms with the past 20 years of his life, acknowledges his regrets and mistakes and understands his life and his wife as he faces a brighter future. Highly recommended for anyone, because most of us never look back and actually tackle the past to see how we can go forward.
B00A72989U|2.0|I bought this album because of a good amazon deal. I spent $3.99 and that was too much. This Alicia Keys album sucks. Just seems as if she didn't put much effort into it.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|I am very familiar with Tolkien's work, having read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings several times, as well as the Silmarillion.  The Hobbit, of course, is in a sense a prequel to the Lord of the Rings, having been written by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins' uncle.  The movie follows the general course of the book, without too many deviations, beginning with an unexpected party and moving from there.  There is a little contrived conflict, with Thorin resisting visiting Rivendell and a little back story fleshing out, with a meeting of the White Council.  Another, more major change, was the creation of Azog, as the main antagonist to Thorin Oakenshield (in the LOTR appendixes, Dain of the Iron Hills killed Azog and it was his son Bolg who lead the attacking orcs), not a big deal though.<br /><br />Peter Jackson has spent an awful lot of time making certain that the Middle Earth landscape and cultures are true to the books.  The cinematography is amazing and the New Zealand landscape shines in the movie.  For a fan of Tolkien it is a real treat to revisit these places with Jackson.<br /><br />That said, the movie is just too long.  I was afraid of this, when Jackson announced that there \\"was just too much material for two films\\" and he was making the Hobbit into three films.<br /><br />The Hobbit deviates significantly from the \\"feel\\" of the Hobbit as a book.  The book was a light hearted jaunt, with several battle scenes, but with much humor thrown in -- more of a children's story, really.  On the other hand, the movie emphasizes fight scenes.  However, the biggest difference to me, is in the characters of Bilbo and the dwarves.  Tolkien shows the dwarves to be bumblers, constantly getting into trouble, requiring Gandalf or Bilbo to rescue them time after time.  In the movie, Jackson reveals them to be battle hardened warriors, who each can single handedly take out half an orc regiment.  Even Bilbo is pretty handy with his small sword, Sting, and battles a couple oforcs to a stand still.<br /><br />Large sections of the movie feel like montages from a video game, with the dwarves and Gandalf decapitating and eviscerating hundreds of orcs.  And while the CGI effects are very nicely done, all of this escapes one of the central themes of the book, which is that small people with big hearts, lots of courage and a little bit of luck can make big differences in the world.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed the movie and will probably watch it again, but it really felt like too little material stretched thin.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious.  It has great music with a lot of comedy and fun.  One of the best movies I have seen in quite some time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the twists and turns.  Well written.  I couldn't put it down.  I kept on reading to find out what happened next.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I love this movie! it came in on time I was very happy about that, I would recommend this movie if you like love story!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My daughter and I read Nicholas Sparks' books and then go to the movie.  He doesn't disappoint us.  Thanks so much.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great book, the whole thing just pulled at my heart strings. I completely related to lake in real life and I really love the character she is and how resilient and beautiful. During this hard time in my own life it's nice to see a character as strong as Lake. Poetry is healthy for the soul, and thank you Colleen Hoover for this perfect read.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|So nice to read this.  It gives us permission to be proud of being an introver.  Very interesting and informative.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|I have really enjoyed this series. It starts out kind of amateur at first, but gets a lot better as it goes along.<br />I have been watching it on my kindle, at my own convenience, which has made it all the more enjoyable.<br />Would recommend it to anyone.
B00A17AD36|4.0|i love this album so many people bad mouth it but i'm a long fan, hopefully he will bring another one out.
B0060D11OU|5.0|I loved this video and watch it whenever it's on the TV.<br />Thanks, Amazon, for having it available for purchase.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|It did take me a bit to catch on to what your trying to do, not just matching 3 tokens but also to get items to the bottom.<br />This makes for a nice break in the day.<br /><br />My only issue is the time element, with some of the puzzles you really can't complete in time unless your lucky enough to have the right tiles fall. Got to day 78 and had to give up as I could not beat it, so instead I deleted the game. I don't want to spend hours trying to get lucky.
B007N6ZH5M|5.0|Excellent insights. Dared to predict on sound logic. Reiterates existence of a global village.China's growth is adulatory,inspiring and also amazing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is an absolutely  amazing piece of literature. I hated it, I loved it, I loved it more & then I loathed it. You don't km now which character to like or even trust..but in all, amazing. Hats off to you,  Ms Flynn.
B00B23O96A|5.0|I love this album. Clapton's voice got better with age! All of Me with Paul sounds great and I think it was very touching to hear Eric cover a Gary Moore song. Very tasteful and enjoyable arrangements! Loved the fiddle parts on Good Night Irene, I wish I could have been that lucky bastard! ;) I also like the fact that Eric included his family on the cd. It's one of those albums that I have to listen to over and over to hear all the nuances. Great job!
0062060554|5.0|I had heard about this book on a TV talk show.  I thought I would give it a try and enjoyed it tremendously.  I'm not an avid reader, but this held my attention.
B00BF11STU|1.0|Watch Argo instead.<br />This is full of Hollywood cliches and bad predictable writing, good signs of a true story right?<br />Silly modern tough feminist slant and half ass political slants, that of course lead nowhere.<br />I am so sick of modern big budget film studios afraid of making a solid stance on a subject that might offend someone or turn away potential ticket buyers.<br />Disgusting torture, lame comedy, and lots foul language in a movie with a serious real life story (that many people around the world suffered from & are still suffering from) really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Soon as I saw the guy chained up in the beginning, I just knew that his pants would get pulled down in front the woman. She was of course mildy disgusted, but had no problem later on assisting in the torture of her victims/interviews.<br />I do believe some of the overall story here is true, but seriously anybody that thinks in this day & age that this movie is 100% true or that we are told the whole story is an idiot !<br />I' m sure this movie will do wonders to improve our Mid East relations.<br />Was waiting for the woman to spit on or see the \\"troops\\" pee on the body of Osama- but I guess they decided to leave that one on the cutting rm floor. Maybe we can all enjoy that when they release another shocking extended directors cut version.<br />I just really feel its a shame that such an important real life story got this, instead of something with some class and a better message for the grieving and world.<br />The most emotion I felt in this was only in the beginning seconds that had 9/11 dialogue, which of course they chickened out of having the actual video to go with.<br />I watch and like tons of movies, but this is just a bad \\"film\\" and also stretched out way too long.<br />I'm sure fans of CSI or law & order will love it & continue to write rave reviews here.<br />And before you go and trash my review or my patriotism, I have no political stance here whatsoever.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|The high speed, (Gigabit), and matching USB 3.0 side of this converter. Wireless is okay, but nothing beats a fast wired connection. :-)
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Way better than 0crap30 - hated that movie !<br />Great cast/acting and smooth storytelling. Ben ya doin good !<br /><br />The only part that bothers me is that I feel this was made & released to provoke<br />new american anger towards Iran for current political war mongering agendas.<br />It's over 30 years ago, so don't let this story affect your current judgment.<br /><br />Any American currently in the Mid East is asking for trouble.<br />They don't want us there, we have no right to be there, and we should leave.<br />The whole oil thing should of and could of been resolved decades ago as far as I'm concerned.<br />People please wake up ! get informed - research the petro dollar.<br />Don't let our corrupt corporate controlled government damage our country any more !
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love everything Jack Reacher! Great suspense, coupled with excellent writing. Wonderful imagery! I can never put these books down!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I had not watched a 007 movie in quite a few years.  I enjoyed this one very much.  It was very entertaining.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I bought all three books in the series. They were spellbinding! I couldn't put them down. The movie couldn't TOUCH the quality of the book. I gave them to a family member to read and told them to pass them on. Now I wish I had them back! I'd like to re-read them!
B008Q08PIK|5.0|This was Audrey Hepburn's first movie!  Edith Head did the costumes.  Gregory Peck was such a handsome leading man.  I enjoyed &#34;taking a trip to Rome&#34; and seeing places I have been.  I also appreciated the values in the movie--Her eventual self denial and choice to do her duty.  Also, how he chose to protect her reputation and not write the story.  How times have changed.....
B004DM0UII|5.0|It offers a good selection of stations and easy to use.  would love to see a better search user interface.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|I was led to believe it was based on a true story but it's not... It looks as if it's based in the late 80's but after seeing tablets and IPhone it was very apparent that it wasn't a true story. It was OK...
B002XWXPC8|4.0|It was an enjoyable movie.  Probably not one I will watch again. I enjoyed the fact it was set in Cleveland. Hey they beat the Yankees, got to love that.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was an interesting and well written book. It kept me in suspense the whole time and ended well. I don't usually read &#34;love story&#34; type novels but this one had a good plot and some dark twists to it so I still enjoyed it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The entire movie was great,, One of the best I have seen in years...It is worth having in  your library
B0090EJR1K|5.0|This movie was hysterical. I was a fan of Borat but not so much of Bruno. I liked this movie as much or more than Borat. If you easily offended this is not the movie for you.
B00AHTYGRW|2.0|I read all the glorious reviews on Affleck's third (?) directorial & starring ensemble flick. I even read the background on the real CIA operation. The beginning was very interesting but as the movie unfolded it seemed very average and formula-matic. Everyone was acting except Affleck. Seems his preparation was to grow a 70's beard and keep it after post production. If he would stop casting himself as a star in his movies perhaps the public wil pay to see it domestically. His presence really hampered my enjoyment of the film. Don't know how this average directorial piece won Oscars's best picture. Seems the Academy felt he was \\"knocked down?\\" Um, Knocked by whom? Bad acting? I liked Zero Dark Thirty. A thoroughly better picture even if the torture scenes were controversial possibly losing many Academy votes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing book, it kept me in suspense the whole time and I wasn't expecting half of the plot twists. I would definitely recommend this book to others. The subject matter is a bit dark so if you are not into that this may not be the book for you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show grabs your attention from Season one, Episode one.  Best to see the show in order, but it is such a well written show that even catching season two, you can get caught up in the story lines and the characters.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|works well on kindle, though weather channel tends to not get thing accurate for this location. may be that the stations are too far away from this point.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|this is so cool it is way more deatailed than temple run two and temple run brave and also just temple run.  . .you should really get this app .like it on facebook and follow them on twitter. if you dont like this app i think you are death and blind because your a nut yack and i think your in loser ally and you dont have good taste.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Son owns this one! He loves it so much and plays the game real well. It is free of glitches and works well on kindle
B00B1OETJW|5.0|Musically excellent!  Andrea's voice is impeccable and the accompanying musicianship is excellent.  The females singing the duets with him were all superb.
B0088O11NU|4.0|enjoyable, like you have the real board in your hands! Trying it is believing it. Some fun the old fashioned way!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I love this movie and i have watched it so many times i just can't get enough of it i would recommend to everybody and its worth buying cause you will not regret it
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|son loves it, has a blast playing it and seeing how far along he can go. Works well on kindle.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I like it. Charges while I'm using the Tablet, charges faster than the USB. Attaches and detaches easily. This is a nice additional charger to have.
0062197266|5.0|This book really caught me off guard. I instantly was intrigued and bought the book but didn't expect to never want to put it down till I was finished. I enjoyed how it was written and would love to see a second book. Maybe a prison escape or something. You just don't know what could happen where Lee is involved. I wanted to slap Sylvia so many times. If I had to compare this book to another I would say Consequences and True by Aleatha Romig. Great read!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|you expect good thriller stories associated with the original author and the tv series delivers. the acting is really good
0670023329|5.0|Great book. Eye opening. Is the guy telling the truth or not? Either way it is a compelling story. Like.
B002QS5OQ4|4.0|not very exciting but really cerebral thinking about the possabilities of space travel. really good stories good graphic effects, good acting
0345440900|2.0|I read this and also Weissbluth. The instructions in this book made way less sense to me. For instance, there is advice to not let baby go to sleep right after feeding. She says something like &#34;who wants to go to sleep after a big meal?&#34;....uh - everyone? If it is between this is Weissbluth, go with Weissbluth.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I personally enjoyed the grand cinematic take, visually.  The costumes, sets, and cinematography were well done.  However I was quite disappointed with the weak vocals performances.  Having watched the stage production, I found this cinema version annoying, and almost unwatchable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|this book held my interest, I love a \\"love story\\",it had romance and suspense and I couldn't wait to see how it ended...a good read :)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Heartwarming, and even a little creepy sometimes.  Would totally recommend if you're looking for a good story.  Hope you enjoy!
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I was sad to see Daniel go but he never really left.  Jonas was a nice addition to the team.  As far as bad guys, Anubis is awesome.  Way better than Apothis.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The author takes you on a journey. Keeps you thinking and reading. Great book can't wait to see the movie.  No way the movie can be as good as the book. In what the characters are thinking.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game .It is so much . You should try it you would like it too .The more levels you complete the harder it gets.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  Having seen the previews for the movie I thought it would be interesting.  It was not.  After 30 pages I gave up and removed it from my Kindle.  It was a waste of time.
B000PAU032|5.0|If you like to listen to movie scores, then Hans Zimmer's music is one that should be in your collection.
B001TKKAGY|5.0|Leonard Cohen never wrote a bad song, but this album is one of his best. Every note, every word, is just pure poetic perfection. Do yourself a favor and get this album immediately.
B00138KK62|5.0|&#34;The Diary of Alicia Keys&#34; is a MUST HAVE for fans of Alicia Keys!!! I bought it from the Amazon store and it plays perfectly on my Kindle Fire! I would like it better if it were like books that you buy on KIndle Fire, bcuz there's an app you can download on other Android devices (smart phone, etc.) that allows you to put the books you've bought for your Kindle Fire onto other devices, but there doesn't seem to be any such thing for music & games, although I could be wrong...maybe I just haven't figured it out yet! When I bought this album, it was on sale for $2.99, and I must say, it was worth every penny!
B004OKFISQ|5.0|Rumours is, simply put, one of the greatest albums ever recorded. If you're looking at it you probably already know that, so just buy it already. I've had the CD for years (from my parents' collection, in fact), and finally bought the vinyl it was meant to be heard on, and it's perfect.
B0018QXL1K|5.0|I was, and still am, a Huge Fan of TLC, so when I saw this album on sale for $2.99, I just had to have it!!! It's great when you go to the Amazon Music Store and find some of your favorite albums on sale! LOVE IT!!!
B0094KTA4Y|5.0|A fun and entertaining Movie that can bring a tear to the eye. This movie is a true family classic that belongs in everyones collection !
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is the best game ever. I'm addicted to it,I just don't have enough money to upgrade:( but I will work to get money to upgrade.
0440237688|5.0|This book is just as enthralling and just as haunting as I remember. It was great for conversation. The boys were just as surprised by some of the plot twists and just as appalled at some of the choices made by the community as I was when their age. It left them begging for more which is always a good thing.
0061438294|5.0|Lots of good info in this book from very good sources. The book is really helping closing some of the gaps that may otherwise arise in communication. It's good for becoming aware of those around and also your own effect on others. Definitely a worthwhile read.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|The product is beautiful<br />has very nice details<br />I only use it in events ( not all the time) and recommend this.<br />good price
B001NHNG64|4.0|So… I stumbled across this author, while searching for a book to read during business travel.<br />I can honestly say I’m hooked, and intend to read the entire “Jack Reacher” series.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always enjoyed Mahjong but frequently was frustrated with reaching a point where no matches could be made and thereby losing the game. This version shuffles the tiles when all possible matches have been found so you can finish the game completely. It has a timer so you may try to beat your own personal best, but that can be ignored if you like. It also has very pleasant flute music playing softly in the background. I turn the volume to a comfortable level, and the music is really quite relaxing.  If you want a stress free version of Mahjong, I recommend you try this one!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this bag after seeing it mentioned in a post on Google+. My D5000 system from Costco came with a Nikon bag with a shoulder strap, which is adequate, but also limited. I also have a [[ASIN:B000EY5R8C Lowepro CompuDaypack Camera Bag (Slate)]] bag, which works fine for my camera and a full sized notebook, but it doesn't have a waist strap -- and is rather heavy. Plus, the camera section on the bottom of the Lowepro is full already.<br /><br />Most of the time, I now only carry a Nexus 7 tablet instead of a notebook. The AmazonBasics bag has plenty of room for my Nexus and my camera, both lenses, and other various camera equipment that I've acquired over the years -- including a small, waterproof WP5300 camera with extra batteries. Plus I have lots of empty space for future expansion. I'm dreaming of getting a [[ASIN:B008B14VAK Nikon 18-300mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX Nikkor Lens]] -- and it's nice to know that I'll have plenty of room.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The first few chapters of the book, made it difficult to get into initially.  However, after reading further into the book I could not put it down.  If you are a fan of Sarah's Key, you will enjoy this book.  If you reflect on the contents of the story and history behind it, you can relate to the time we are living in some scary ways.  A very good read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the cheesiest thing in the universe but I cant stop playing it! i mean really? A security guard in a Bunny suit? I bumped a barrier on my turbo hoverboard and the bunny guard was right behind me hualling A$$! that was awesome!
B0049VZ222|5.0|this is an amazing show. i was hooked the first time i watched it ans i came in to it in the middle of the season.
B0030B621W|4.0|Not many actors can hold my attention for an hour and a half doing a solo act he has a different twist with reactions and emotions<br />yet that can be identified in each of us.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow is all I could say too bad the movies take so long in production, because the books were a fast read. I have to reread the books just to keep everything fresh in my mind. Love the books
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The amazing part of this movie is how it holds your interest with so many visual tastes and epiphanies of how I never saw how much beauty can be showed by the creative eye and emotions crafted by each situation Pi was dealt with. I was totally surprised and elated
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well written book, just wondering why the second two books weren't better??? Otherwise overall I have recommend this series to a few of my close friends.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|[[ASIN:B00BQPEIT2 Temple Run: Oz]] was purchased and attempted on [[ASIN:B007M50PTM Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi)]] and I am pleased to report that the game does have some beautiful scenery & the original Temple Run game-play mechanics wherein one has to swipe up to jump and swipe down to slide to avoid obstacles along the path are still there which got these Temple Run series the much celebrated acclaim. The new scenery that this game adds is the sorta \\"Occasional\\" tilt-controlled hot air balloon sequence which in my opinion is pretty pleasing to look at and adds charm to the game.<br /><br />Thank goodness! despite the gorgeous new environment and graphics the frame rates do not suffer as much to cause annoyance. I still wish the developer takes feedback and adds some means to control the graphics quality to improve the frame rates little better so that it plays more smoothly just like the original Temple Run game.<br /><br />IMHO, The reason why [[ASIN:B008J1ZVRY Temple Run: Brave]] did not gain traction as much as the original [[ASIN:B0086700CM Temple Run]] or [[ASIN:B00B2V66VS Temple Run 2]] is because of the poor frame rates one could achieve with the current tablets and phones out there on the market. Once a player sees the jittery of the character on the screen and cannot navigate by tracking your split second response the game-play gets boring.<br /><br />Having said, the bugging screens to download and install Dark Forest(Add-on Module) which is seen available as a free additional downloadable environment to run through in Temple Run: Oz annoyance is just too much to bear (not to mention additional download which works best with Wi-Fi only to avoid data download costs) early in the game-play. Get rid of that nagging screen just to get 3 free gems or include \\"dark forest\\" module as part of the game in the next update release and you have a winner game.<br /><br />Also out of curiosity why is this game not compatible with Kindle fire? is there a technical reason for it? or purely business!? I can tell you it works just fine on any Android based tablets (including KF) why is it not compatible with Kindle fire series? on Amazon? APP store. Fix that and I will rate this game with full five stars! just like the Original Temple Run.<br /><br />Cheers!chnical reason for it? or purely business!?

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Didn't want this series to end. I couldn't wait for the books to come out and I surely couldn't wait for the movies to come out. I have enjoyed the whole series
B007N6NGYG|3.0|The game was attempted on [[ASIN:B007M50PTM Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi)]] and pleased to report that it works fantastic. The graphics is good and while the game-play gets progressively harder due to a lot of thinking and processing that one needs to do to route the trains properly to their respective stations takes the charm out of the game too early. The scenes and train movements are very cute to look at but I only wish that the tracks and the level of difficulty can be controlled by some menu options to make this game even more enjoyable. Also if the developer is reading this review please add option to have sound effect and music separate options. I like to have sound-effects ON and music OFF. Thanks for reading my feedback.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Why is it when a series is written the second book isn't always as good as the first. With this series it is true, I was very dissatisfied with this book.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|The cutest character in the whole world of Android game got even more hungry in this [[ASIN:B007KQ6XYY Cut the Rope: Experiments]] game. I just cannot stop feeding him. Lovely game worthy of 100 stars! Purchase today and you can cuddle the cutie, feed him and make him happy :-)<br /><br />Thanks to the developers for making a true gem! This is a must have game! - Highly adorable!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Peter Jackson has done it again. The actors were great and the scenery beautiful. It is too bad it will take three years to see the whole book. However I know it will be worth the wait.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have enjoyed it very much and hate to see it end. The only complain I have, I wish  it comes on at 8PM instead of 9PM.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Like a bad dream. Very strange, bizarre, waste of time and money. Really odd. Confusing. Rather mow the yard. Don't watch.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I know that the director is trying to milk &#34;The Hobbit&#34; for three films and therefore I feel there has been a little to much padding on these movies. Having said that, like a good little LOTR and Tolkien fan I will purchase and enjoy all three movies. This movie was a fun romp through middle Earth with some sections of the movie looking like adverts for a theme park ride but other than that it was great fun and high quality.
B005FPT51K|5.0|Does everything as advertised; setup complete in about 15 minutes. Easy to setup port forwarding on a netgear wireless router so everyone can view on WAN. Really like that you can customize usernames and pws for viewers. Clarity is good and there's hardly any lag on Verizon 3G.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I really enjoyed the Hurt Locker and this film didn't dissappoint. When I first saw the film in the theator it seemed a little long but after watching it at home I actually didn't want it to end! I really, really loved it. The OP that killed OBL in the end was really cool but all the work done in the preceeding years leading up to the Seal Team 6 operation was interesting and thought provoking as well. Kathryn Bigelow seems to be getting better and better. I realize there are a large number of very talented people that work with her, but isn't that the way it is with any great director? I think she has been improving her art and this film is a real Tour de force of her film making abilities. Can't wait to see her next movie.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I love the tone curb editor this thing has, looks just like the one I use on photshop but from the convenience of my phone!
B0053O89IS|5.0|We are hooked on this series.  Great condition, received promptly as promised.  I ordered it ahead of time to ship when released.  That makes it convenient to order.  This season came out after season 8 started, so wasn't caught up.  Hope season 8 comes out before season 9 is released.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I have faithfully followed the series and was not let down by this book. This installment is perhaps one of the fastest moving ones. Fast paced with plenty of suspense!
B000031EGV|5.0|Got the movie promptly and in perfect shape.  Great price on a good movie that is hard to find in the stores.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was suspenseful and didn't know how it would turn out.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys suspense.
B005DN5BE4|1.0|although my internet signal on my laptop, android and computer were excellent, the signal according to the player said poor, I didn't get to watch the movie
0815411839|5.0|This book is a great read. Very captivating from start to finish. Taught me a lot about Marilyn and Hollywood that I didn't know.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Didn't expect much from a free title, but it's turned out to be a pretty good time killer. Having a bit more control over your samurai would be nice, but there's still enough fun to be had as is.
B00BEN0YP8|4.0|Schindler's list is a great movie for anyone that is interested in a look at the struggles the Jewish people endured during the Holocaust. The movie begins in 1939, in Poland at the beginning of WWII. Liam Neeson plays the character of Oskar Schindler. Schindler is a powerful German business man who sees an opportunity to capitalize on the current situation. He then teams up with Ben Kingsley's character, Itzak Stern, to start a factory employing Jewish workers. Itzak Stern is head of the Judenrat Council, and is able to provide assistance to the Jewish people in getting employment to avoid being shipped away to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Steven Speilberg does a great job as a director of this movie. Speilberg gives a great view of the struggle the Jewish people went through as families were killed, split apart from each other, and then forced to abandon their beliefs for the sake of survival. The film being in black and white is wonderful way to bring the viewer to somber mood of the camps and the time frame. Ralph Fiennes plays Amon Goeth, who is the Nazi commandant for the Krakaw camp. Fiennes does wonders in his ruthless portrayal of a leader in the Nazi party. This movie gives you time to really form your own opinions on the subject. Schindler's realization of the hurt around him begins to show in his business practices, leaving many of the Jewish people seeking refuge in working in his factory. After watching this movie about the Holocaust, I can understand the importance of remembering these events so history does not repeat itself again. The Holocaust has had great influence in the way modern Jewish and non-Jewish people think. Many can agree that the Holocaust was a terrible tragedy. It has also influenced many modern Jewish peoples tolerance of other Jewish groups.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|As the name suggests, there are lots of games to play with varying difficulty levels.  It's easy to play and offers hints when you need help to complete a puzzle.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|The Train Crisis is a very challenging game. You need to look at each scene and decide which tracks to switch, the order to switch them, and the timing of the switch, so your trains don't crash into each other and make it to their respective stations. The graphics in the game are rich and full of colors. The one thing I would liked changed is the placement/size of the level number banner. It's placed in the upper left corner and covers most of the top half of the screen on my Android smartphone. The problem is sometimes the banner covers up a train or train station, so I don't notice it until the level starts. By that time, I don't have enough time to re-think my strategy and I have a train crash. Despite this, you need to be careful, as this game is very addictive!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|** spoiler alert ** The main strength of this book lies in its pace. The story flows effortlessly for the most part, and it's easy to root for and feel sorry for the main characters. The main problem with this book is the many logical inconsistencies regarding human nature, starting with the main premise of the first novella, which works in the novella because you don't have enough information to question it, but falls apart under any scrutiny AT ALL. It is stated clearly that no one has ever not done the cleaning. This is wrong. I know it is wrong because I, for one, would not do the cleaning, and I'm not that different from most people I know. But even if you argue that I am that much different, it still is impossible to believe that in all those hundreds of years not even a single person felt enough sense of injustice that they said, 'hey, those pricks just sent me out here to die, maybe I'll skip the cleaning and just see what's on the other side of that hill'.<br /><br />The second problem is the great effort the bad guys go to create a false image on the view screen. Why? Supposedly it is to reinforce the desire to do the cleaning. Wait. Wouldn't it instead increase your desire to take your helmet off, right then and there, melting your face off in the blurry screen (which would certainly seem to work against the illusion the ITs are trying to create)? Then there are the flimsy leaky space suits. The way the story tells us this comes about is a reaction by IT to some events over time. But then we find out that the same thing is going on in the other silos, so are we to believe that the same events occurred independently and yet simultaneously in them? Plus it's just plain idiotic that Bernard would have installed Lukas in the main server room with all that juicy knowledge and expected that he wouldn't push the one button he was told not to.<br /><br />I thought the few main characters were well developed, and had realistic strengths and weaknesses. All the secondary characters kind of blended in together and I had trouble distinguishing them or remembering who they were from previous sections. The mechanics, especially, I pictured as an amalgamation of Ripley's marines in Aliens. I don't know why exactly, but they always seemed wet and dirty and running through tunnels with sticks of dynamite or radio parts in their hands. The one primary character issue I did have was in the end, concerning Juliet. When she was offered the job as mayor, wouldn't her first thought be `elevator'? And her second, `I'm going to visit my new friends at the next silo and I'm going to bring them some pudding cups and a working toilet.' But no, she actually says nothing about them at all. AT ALL.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is okay. It was an easy read which is welcome after some of the other books I have read lately. Refreshing
B0083EM24C|3.0|The 3 songs I know - LOVE.  The rest...weird.  #6 is great but the rest...eh.  I know I sound like I am in high school but I am 36 and a huge music fan.  This album is odd.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|4 stars because, even if the order came very quickly (it was supposed t be delivered in 35 days, i got it in 10) there is a glitch on one of de blurays. One mini-glitch, but it's 40 secs of an episode less.<br /><br />Good, but not perfect..
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app, it is very informative and I really appreciate the entire layout of the weather. It's important to me too see the entire breakdown of the weather. I highly recommend this app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is lots of fun! But I wish that it had breeds other than Quarter Horses like Belgians Fjords yes they are real!!!! And I have pin so burn I love Nessa Love Morgan E.
B0074MZSWW|2.0|I hated to rate this badly because I love the music and the band.  But, the CD has some audio issues on the first song and you can hardly stand listening to it at a certain point.  The CD is not scratched so it must have happened in manufacturing which is a shame.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I will start this by saying I was a huge skeptic.  There was no way that a movie could either A) do justice to the masterful onstage performances of any of the live London OR Broadway casts OR B) do justice the poetic and deep writings of Victor Hugo.  I really thought this would be a shallow attempt at greatnesss.<br /><br />I was WRONG!!!  I ended up liking the movie BETTER than the stage performance.  WHY?  B/c the camera was so intrusively personal for the most private of scenes, that you felt you were in the chapel with Valjean, in the gutter with Fantine knowing you'd never get out of the hole you'd fallen into.  I wept throughout and especially at the end of this soaring tribute to Mr. Hugo's classic.<br /><br />I disagree with others who find fault with the singing voices of the actors.  It was raw and not as rehearsed and I felt the emotion of the scenes as they were meant to be.  Just got the disc on Friday and already watched it 4 times.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Amazing!!! Time can not be replaced. It's a special God given gift. I love how he captured that. Awesome book!
1616890835|5.0|If you a signpainter (as is paint with a brush) not this bs computer crap then this is a great book
B005K17RU0|2.0|I got a message that my &#34;old&#34; version of AccuWeather needed to be replaced, so I did.  What I had was a nice widget that gave me what I needed - time and temperature with a nice picture.  Thanks to this &#34;you need to replace AccuWeather&#34; message, I don't have that anymore - I have a big hole in my screen replaced by an icon that has to be opened to get the information I used to just have without opening anything.<br /><br />The app itself works fine...including the annoying weather alerts, so this review is more of a protest against what I was told to get rid of and not getting something similar to replace it.
B004XC5LP0|5.0|i watch this so much my family hid from me at one point.<br /><br />i just love the scenery, so much so i want to visit wallace , especialy the cabin on the lake, it's just gorgeous, that is my dream home!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Liked the app very much before the recent update. What were they thinking??? Dislike new format greatly. Time to begin search for better option.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Intoxicating, sophisticated, demanding, uncompromising, familiar and yet always seductively satisfying. Can't wait for Season 6! This is a must watch series and season five most definitely delivered.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The plot and storyline is well developed with the episodes building on the one before. I liked the interaction between the characters.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|No one can take away the cachet and savoir faire of the Sean Connery and Roger Moore Bonds, but this entry in the Daniel Craig Bonds is special in its own way. Lots of derring-do and action; yet the deeper emotions evoked in this movie seem appropriate at this stage of the Bond franchise.<br /><br />Best of all-- to borrow a Bondian phrase-- nobody does it better at this stage than Daniel Craig! Don't miss it. (Watched on the Kindle Fire HD and quality was top-notch.)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|every parent should get this for their kids.  it is a fun learning tool.<br />requires focus and deductive reasoning in a game form.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This show has become a favorite of mine.  Its so sick and twisted that I can't wait to buy the other 4 seasons.  I must figure out how to see it on my big TV instead of on my laptop.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The first was addictive, the second had some glitches, now the third installment of dungeon hunter is beyond awesome, it's mutha fluffin awesome!
B004QIG7CW|5.0|I watched this with my daughter and enjoyed it. The music and characters are all likeable. A good family entertainment.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative.  I am actually on the wheat diet now.  The recipes are really good.  I have only been on the diet for a few weeks and I am losing inches.
B00622B3MY|4.0|This movie is far removed from the first Cars.  I wish the storyline could have been more on the lines of that first movie.  Also I find it a bit too violent for little children.  My 3 year old likes the movie but was at first a bit freaked out by the frequent shootings.  I am not one of those people that are over the top about this kind of thing, I just found it odd that they took this route for the second movie.
B002WJI66C|5.0|Shipped quickly and quality was great as advertised.  Could not find this in any store so was very pleased to see it here.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie is an unusual and touching human interest story about care giving and the person being &#34;cared&#34; for. Clinical vs. human interaction with a real person who happens to be in need assistance and a unique man who had no experience but what &#34;just what the doctor ordered.&#34;  Fun and entertaining movie for all.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My kids weren't thrilled at first to watch this but since then, they've asked to watch it again and again.  Classic!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Me and my fiancée love challenging eachother in this game! So simple yet fun! Great graphics! Only downside, I wish it had more challenges, like daily goals.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Love this.  Have watched it several times already and am greatly anticipating the sequel due out in May.  Hope the new one is as good as this.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|I saw it in the theater.  I watched it again at home.  It still gives me chills.  What an amazing story of a sweet and kind man!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|The second half is fabulous. Here is what to expect. Songs nearly all of the time, the younger actors sing much better, and cinematic elements being shifted to the emotional states of the actors. There are also liberties taken with the plot. In the end, I prefer the one with Liam Neeson.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love price matching with this at Target. Or just getting reviews on any product while I am at a store.
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|There is no dialouge, but it doesn't need it. You are able to see the story unfold while being amazed by the art of the performances!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this show!! I'm know watching the current season and it is good as well.the first season was very good and I highly recommend this show.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|This movie has a fun and upbeat feel with some drama thrown in for fun. The talented dancers have plenty of opportunities to show off. The movie is a great movie for that fun movie night!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. The characters were quirky and interesting. I also loved that it was mostly set in India. I'm surprised that I liked it so much, but it was great.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George Martin has done it he has built a series that truely gets better to read the further you get into it. I found it hard to read books 1 & 2, but was able to read book 3 and barely able to put it down until the last nod in the epilogue. It was full of action and too many surprises to count! I recommend this book highly. I can't wait for season three of Game of Thrones on HBO.
0345803485|3.0|Good book, a little far fetched but worth the read.A realistic version would be the book called \\"for better or  money\\" by Amy Minty, both good books. Thank you both of you. Brendan
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this book.  I would recommend it.  I saw the movie too, but I think the book was better because it had more of a plot to it.
B000274THQ|5.0|A good introduction to this time period and perspective. Good for classes or for entertainment! A view from the east side of the iron curtain.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|It's a bit soap opera-y. Also some incidents are predictable. Aside from that, my husband and I really enjoy watching it. The acting and filming is excellent.
B00B935SUY|5.0|I was very surprised that this documentary was so good! If you love music, this is one of the best documentaries you will ever see. I have a new appreciation for Dave Grohl and some of the bands that I didn't have before. This is historical and vibrant. I used to go to the brewery across the street and never knew about Sound City. I would love to have a t-shirt. I cant say enough about this labor of love on Dave Grohls part except you must see it.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I've seen this twice in theaters and still needed to preorder the DVD. The movie is wonderful and the extra versions (Blu-Ray, Ultraviolet, etc.) are a great perk.
B009Y6UCRC|4.0|its Joe Bonamassa and if youre a fan you will enjoy his playing. Beth Hart is good but this all sounds like its been done before, Try Susan Tedeschi or Janiva Magness and so on.............
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Too bad I have to give this one star in order to post a review. This app was not worth 99 cents. No matter how many times I tried to put in my location all it gave me was Los Angeles' weather. If this is the quality of the typical Kindle Fire app, I think I'll just be using it to read books.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Zero Dark Thirty, which is military talk for 12:30 AM, tells the story of the hunt for Osama bin Laden (about two-thirds of the movie), as well as his eventual take-down (the final third of the movie).  So while it features Navy SEALs in the final act, the real focus is on the intelligence agents who who pursued UBL with dogged determination for more than ten years, particularly Maya (played with intensity by Jessica Chastain).<br /><br />The film won a slew of awards in various categories, including best picture, best director, best actress, best screenplay, best editing and others.  It was also nominated for many awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture (it lost to Argo).<br /><br />The blu-ray transer is what one would expect for a recent release--excellent picture and sound--with one exception.  The bin Laden take-down was done at night, and Kathryn Bigelow mimics nighttime conditions as much as possible.  This did not work so well on my TV at home.  The picture was so dark that I had to eliminate all ambient light in the house in order to make out what the SEALs were doing.  I did not remember the movie being that dark when I saw it in the theater.<br /><br />Parental Advisory: This is not a movie for children.  It features torture portrayed in a realistic manner.  This is very difficult to watch even for a guy like me who is used to war movies.  The movie also contains a realistic battle scene at the end of the movie, where people are shot and blood is spilled.  There is also strong language, alcohol, explosions, shootings, etc.  Parents would need to judge whether their high school students could handle it.  I would not recommend it for junior high or below.  Even some adults with sensitive consciences may be bothered.<br /><br />I highly recommend Zero Dark Thirty.  It is a piece of history that will live in the memories of those of us who witnessed the events of 9/11.  This movie manages to maintain suspense, even though you already know how it turns out in the end.turns out in the end.
0062064304|5.0|Um dos meus filmes preferidos, gostaria muito que fizessem uma continuação. O livro tem um acabamento incr&iacute;vel belo trabalho. com muitas ilustrações e fotos &eacute; uma importante peça para fãs
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|Good app for tablets. Just so people know, some of the drop-down menues may not be visible on the Galaxy Note 2.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|Simply put, I love this app. The puzzles are challenging enough to make you feel great when you find the solution. Zero permissions needed. Best buck i ever spent.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|its a great app for kids and grown up my granny even plays this game I would try it out.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I loved this movie. I Plan on buying it. Girlfriend loved it too! There were No issues with watching it online.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|This was a movie that my 14 year old would actually watch with me.  It was a cute movie.  We enjoyed it.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|I bought thinking it was like the one on TV which you could remove the brushes to clean easy but theses don't come off its the Max that does that not this one
B0090P98Z4|5.0|fun to play. lots of action and sword play. Just down loaded to my Kindle Fire. Seems like the Gladiator game or Deer Hunter.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I spent all day sunday in another time learning history and lots of other valuable lesssons while enjoying myself immensely
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love this game. Love the retro style too !! I like how you can continue after completing a level even after you die. You don't have to start at the beginning again. Cool retro style game !!
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Upgraded from free app because screen shot says you can 'wake to your favorite music.' It took nearly three weeks for this option to be available and is very cumbersome to use, especially with a large music collection. Also, the sound seems to spontaneously reset itself, usually to silent. I assumed I was at fault the first time or two this happened, not the case. It still happened when I carefully and deliberately set the volumes as the last thing I did before I slept. Because of this I cannot rely on this alarm alone. I do like the weather feature and overall look of app.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|this was a story about a true American hero.  The story is told in his own selfless way.  We only wish he was still around.  My grandchildren will get a chance to read this and understand what it means when a man can love his country and his wife and all those around him can apreciate him for it.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Not particularly challenging, but fun. The dialog and plot is good and keeps you engaged. Things are starting to get a little repetitive so hopefully as I play more it will change.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hopeless really pulls you in as it is so descriptive in the characters and their depth of feelings at such a young age. The book begins moving toward such a deep connection there is no putting it down.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It dragged on from the start to end with no real story, bad acting and terrible script.  It really tried in places too hard to be funny and it just wasn't.  Maybe because I am almost 40, I did not find it funny, scary or even remotely interesting.  I would pass on this movie 100%, I am sorry that I wasted $5 to watch this.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I will check out anything by this writer and as always never disappointed! Clever twists and turns throughout. Always trying to guess the outcome but always a surprise. I feel anyone who has ever read Grisham will really want to read this pageturner.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|great game. very fun to play. we play it a lot and highly recommend. it is lots of fun to play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing! It is very realistic. I  am 13,and I love horses. As I live in the city, this is as close as I can get to owning a horse.  The only let down is isyou have to buy some stuff with real money. You don't really need that stuff to enjoy the game, though. Overall I totally recommend it.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Mastery, inspired and comprehensible book about last astronomical and physical finding. Abreast of the modern (not post-modern!) age. (Quote of the “Afterword of Richard Dawkins”: Nothing expands the mind like the expanding universe.)<br />Rosta
0525478817|5.0|John Green wrote an absolute masterpiece that is heartfelt and witty.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to find a book about life and what we take for granted.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|THIS WAS A AWESOME BOOK. PEOPLE SHOULD READ IT FOR INSPERATION AND LIFE LESSONS THAT MORRIE TEACHES TO MITCH THE STUDENT
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I just needed something to test out melodies. This works great for that.  Haven't tried any advanced features.  App is very easy to use.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I saw all the 5 star reviews and thought there must be some in-game incentive to rate the game or something else going on here. I've never seen this many 5 star reviews on the AppStore. Well, after playing the game, I've come back to add my own 5 star review. I've played through the entire game and had a blast! They've done it right. It's so simple and challenging at the same time. Very creative with the changing color schemes, sounds and 3D invincible flip mode just for fun! I need to go back and earn all the points, so it's definitely got replay value. It combines Space Invaders, Galaga, Break Out, and many other nods to old school coin-op games... very clever. I couldn't put it down. Samsung Galaxy S3
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Totally loved Spartacus, season one, and I totally loved Gods of the Arena, too. Both of them are great shows! The writing, the sets, and the casting, everything is great about those shows. And when it comes to casting, if ever there was an actor who can command both the respect of his male audience, and the hearts of his female audience, it's Dustin Clare. He's a \\"man's man\\" and that's not gay, btw. It means that Dustin Clare is a man other men (straight men) can respect, even admire. I'd say he would be the perfect actor for the role of Trent Smith in the book, Killer of Killers, if that might ever be made into a movie. In Killer of Killers, Trent Smith is a martial arts champion, and who better to play the part of a martial arts champion than Dustin Clare, AKA Gannicus, the champion gladiator. But I digress. Suffice it to say Dustin Clare is such a complete actor, he could play any tough guy in any film. Kudos to Starz for casting Dustin Clare as Gannicus.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free is an amazing app.So addictive I'm playing it every day.Some levels are hard so I need help but flow is a really good app so download it now
B004H6G0TI|4.0|Really fun game but every time I get a laser power up the game crashes! Also when I complete a level sometimes. Makes it unplayable :(
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Ok thought it would be good but it wasn't very.Don't want to buy sequel but that is the only way to finish the bit I'm on
B0054A0CZY|5.0|Anyone who has ever listened to simple plan will appreciate this album, it is mature and more importantly it is very positive music, great album
B003U53GK8|5.0|I have loved the whole series of Lost. I wish there was more. The ending they came up with was very good. I loved seeing everyone  in the final episode.
B004GYY714|1.0|Tune in radio has great promise but falls to perform. The station drops out and freezes, even while I have 8Gig of RAM and a high speed cable internet connection.
0060245867|5.0|The book was brand new.  The cover was not damaged in any way.  My granddaughter donated the book yo her school library in honor of Dr. Seuss' Birthday.  It arrived on the date promised.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|this is a incredible album,a must have vinyl and comes with digital download,one of the best albums I have heard in years
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The trilogy was amazing. I zoomed through them and wish I would have taken my time since this was the last book. It was hard to put down, anyone who reads it will understand why!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It gives an indepth look at the conditions our combat veterans face.  He brings his wife into the book to express her views of what is happening in their world.  Being retired military myself I could identify with most of their emotions.  Has some tough language at spots, but other than that, a terrific, informative and interesting read.
B000EUDAWG|1.0|Tarantula only walks sometimes don't know if I got a defected one or simply they're just not what I expected or should I say simply not working correctly
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I saw this movie years ago, and could hardly wait for this new release. I went to the midnight release when it opened. All I can say is \\"EPIC\\".<br />When I saw that the release for DVD was 3/22/13, I pre-ordered it. I thought it would be here on the 24th, but low and behold it arrived on 3/22/13, the actual release date.<br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone that like history and musicals.<br />WARNING: You will need a box of Kleenex.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|This band boasts the best female vocalist on the planet, bar none, and the most insane drummer going around - check out their DVD and YouTube clips if you don't believe me.<br /><br />There are a couple of radio-friendly slower tracks, including one Evanescenesque song, but I suppose the band are developing their sound. There are also some pop-thrash tracks which are complete opposite, so I hope the band don't alienate fans who like both and can settle on a style. And I hope that style is along the lines of the best tracks - 'Miss the Misery' (see the acoustic version online), the Van Halenish 'American Boys' and the Whitesnakish closer 'Here's To Us'.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It helps locate apps and system status very well. I would highly recommend this if you use many apps in addition to those that come with your device.
B001SGEUNI|4.0|An outstanding effort by a young band. The singer is truly special - the best female vocalist in the business, without exception - while the band, especially drummer, are also superb musicians. Check out vocal efforts of the singer on YouTube on acoustic versions, especially Download Festival 2012.
B002S45V32|5.0|Still a great movie after all of these years.  I don't think too much has changed in the world of teens.
B00418NVMQ|5.0|For a young one-album band at the time, this CD and, especially, DVD, is outrageously good; for an older experienced band it would be excellent too. They play a perfect blend of pop-metal, with a couple slower tracks that aren't radio-friendly crap, even an acoustic set complete with stool on stage for the guitarist.<br /><br />But what makes this band - and CD/DVD - truly special is the singer's voice - the best female vocalist in the business, bar none - and her brother, a truly insane drummer who does a drum solo that's actually work watching. Even more impressive is the singer's efforts on acoustic tracks on YouTube (especially the Download Festival 2012)<br /><br />The only disappointment is that contains only all the tracks from the Halestorm 1st album, and nothing else. Nothing from the 2nd almbum and no covers.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|If you like the Family Guy humor with the the PG-13 edits, then you'll enjoy this movie because this Family Guy with no holds barred.  The story and plot was a typical boy meets girl plot but all the little quips and snide remarks in this movie is what made it a funny movie for me.  Again, before you decide to buy or rent this movie, watch Family Guy.  If it made you laugh out loud or even chuckle at all the morally incorrect jokes then this movie is for you.  If you're easily offended at racial, ethical, and/or religious jokes then this movie is not for you.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|Just when you think this series is entering a strange land, it gets stranger! Strong performances all around. How we can still sympathize for Walt is beyond me.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Very nice game.  Reminds me of some of the old arcade classics I used to play, years ago.  Get it!
B00BF11STU|4.0|We have wanted to view this movie since it came out. It is a probing look at the search, and finally, the killing of Osama Bin Laden. My only complaint, it was about 20 minutes too long. A little more editing would have made the movie a 5 star event, not a 4 star one.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|I like the fact that both the DVD and Blu-ray is in one package.  Some times I show the movie on an old DVD player.  The movie has great action and plot.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|In the mafia, they call it going to the mattresses. Here in Breaking Bad, Walt goes to war with his meth dealing boss. I won't reveal how it ends, but it is a great ride.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|The movie arrived ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.  I would recommend this film for anyone who wants to see the Navy Seals in action.  Many of the characters are played by real Navy Seals.  Great action.  Makes you proud of our military.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This could possibly be the best suspense series I've ever seen. Along with Breaking Bad, Homeland is redefining what a TV series is about. I can't wait to watch season 2.
1616550414|5.0|Gostei muito do livro, tem ilustrações fantásticas! É um material muito importante para quem é fã de videogames, fã de Zelda e fã da Nintendo.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I'm always looking forward the the next episode. Acting is superb, especially the role of Carson. There is always the main story to follow, plus several sub-plots.
B004GJXQ20|3.0|first i want to comment on the eBook itself:<br />was delivered to my iPad within seconds of purchase. didn't find many spelling errors (there were some, but not as mentioned in other reviews). all in all, a good eBook (though the maps could've been of higher resolution).<br /><br />THE BOOK:<br /><br />I don't think it's that good of a book. it's very nice to read, but not that thrilling or suspensive. sometimes you get bored when reading it - so I think that a lot of the excitement around the book is pure hype. Also, i find the division of \\"chapters\\" to be by characters silly, as the story is told in third person anyway, so he could've divided it into regular chapters.<br />moreover - and most important - i find the killing of characters left and right, and cutting their plot lines as he does to be a gimmick. i think it only enables him to write as many books as possible, and only stopping when there's no more profit to be made. you don't really have a main character per-se, rather a lot of character the story revolves around which is fine; but as some of them die and others come along there's no end to it. frankly, if it weren't for HBO i wouldn't even buy it.<br /><br />so all in all, a nice book, nice author. no more, but no less.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was hard to put down. I love love love it! There was nothing I didn't like about it.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|For any that have seen it, this is a little like an extra violent Hopscotch.  Based on old spies vs. new spies.  Fans of Willis will like this, he is up to his usual self.  Fans of Malkovich will think this is a must own.  One of his best performances.  Fans of Brian Cox will certainly enjoy this as well.  Urban, Mirren, Freeman, and Parker all put in good supporting performances.
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|To start off with, I am a HUGE David Bowie fan.  Have seen him in concert about 30 times.  I told my wife that when she married me that she also marries David Bowie.  So this review comes from the heart.  When \\"Where Are We Now\\" was released I was not overwhelmed but I liked it.  I thought it reflected where David was at this point in his life and was anxious to hear the rest of the new record.<br /><br />For the 1st time I can remember  with a new Bowie record I found myself forwarding to the next track becuase it was painful for me to listen to it.  Maybe it's just me where I am at in MY life that I appreciate a quieter sound, clear production and easily audible words.  I found none of this.  I know I will most likely never listen to a recording again when to me the songs all sound the same.  I thought the production was horrible lyrics inaudible at a frantic almost meth like rush of sound, it actually made me feel nervous to listen to it (I know, a sign of aging  :-))  I seriously don't think I will be able to listen to this record all the way through,  just to pretend I like it because it's a Bowie record.<br /><br />So, if there was a \\"neutral\\" rating I would have given it that rather than a 1 star.  Perhaps I am just at a point where I don't like fast loud music aka industrial/NIN/ etc etc.  I find when I want to relax these days it's Bach, or Telemann etc. It may just be a matter of , as David said as Andy Warhol in Basquiat when Basquiat painted over his stuff, \\"Gee, I don't even know what's good anymore.\\"  It may be that.  But I will always love David Bowie and the many years of joy he has gieven me.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|But Amazon is asking me to do it again.<br /><br />This isn't quite your normal rock disc, it seems to tell a story as you go along, the whole disc is cohesive and is extremely enjoyable, SixxAM had so much success with this, that they decided to try and put out another album.  I don't own it, but based on what has played on the radio, it doesn't have as much feeling, or feel as full as the tracks on this disc.  There are a lot of very moving songs on it, and nothing that needs to be skipped, which is saying something as easy as it is to remove something from a playlist.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Oh wow,,,,,,,,,,,this is a wonderdul CD.  I get lost in the music every time I play it.  I often walk from my parking garage to work, 2 miles, and twice I have actually walked past the front door of my building because I was so into this CD.  I hope Josh keeps them coming. :)
B004UID2LC|3.0|I helped my daughter buy Kindles for her kids for Christmas and they were connected to my internet at Christmas time

B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Without a doubt the best musical film I've seen. Going for live performances (instead of lip syncing) was a gamble, but WOW, it paid off!<br />Make sure you have good speakers to truly appreciate this brilliant adaptation.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|Very funny! I laugh out loud every episode , you can't say that about many shows! all the characters are every funny ,I have a&#34; Nick&#34; in my life so watching him every week makes my life seem so much funnier!
B000LXHK2C|5.0|I enjoyed this very much. It is in my top ten of all time favorite films. Why? Ridley Scott can direct just about everything. It would appear that Ridley directed a kind of homage to his love of French cinema here. And he brings a stellar group together for this project. Don't let Russell Crowe haters tell you otherwise. His performance is \\" grand \\" here. Scott directs this comedy with heart more than precision and that kind of direction makes the film more enjoyable than his previous foray into comedy ( Matchstick Men ). Make no mistake here: It's a love story with comedy. But it looks like a postcard from France than a new chick flick. Stellar movie. P.S get the widescreen version to see the fantastic landscape.
B007C12RDS|5.0|I find this series very refreshing I love it ! and watch it over and over  very family friendly viewing!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Could have done without most of the torture scenes. Seems like they were trying to make a political statement that was unnecessary.<br />The rest of the movie was very good. Would recommend and would watch again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I understand this might not be for everyone but ... has an excellent story line ! great characters! and the zombies are excellent! I am completely hooked!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was so taken with books 1&2 that I was taking my Kindle everywhere with me, reading every chance I could.  I stayed up late for days reading these books into the wee hours of the morning.  I even dreamed about these books which I have never done.  I love Gideon and Eva.  The story is so well written and I just can't get enough.  Was ready to start the third book and then my heart sank when I realized that it wasn't out yet.  I'm crushed that we have to wait until June 4th.  :(  Love these books and highly recommend!!!
0141197714|5.0|I just spent the past four months reading the six novels of Jane Austen.  I'm not a scholar.  I'm a middle age man who likes many different book and movie subjects.  I just never got around to reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" until I recently stumbled upon the dvd movie \\"Becoming Jane\\".  I enjoyed the movie, went on the internet to teach myself some facts, etc.  Everything I found seemed to flow toward \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  So after reading that first novel, and then purchasing the BBC Jennifer Ehle dvd serial, I re-read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" within the next few days.  I was then caught up in the excitement I found online about Jane Austen.<br /><br />Second to read was \\"Emma\\", followed by bird-dogging a dvd copy of the Kate Beckinsale film adaptation.  And then I just kept on until tonight finishing reading \\"Northanger Abbey\\", novel number six in my progress.  What a hoot!  For me, this was the easiest of the novels to read (with a little research along the way concerning gothic novels).  Austen includes her own voice in the narrative, so I felt like she was present...alive.  My mind's eye pictured Catherine (heroine) as a very appealing, genuine and fun type of human being.  Of course there are scoundrels and snobs as in the other novels, but there is less emphasis on evil, and lots of humor.  I even had sympathy for the gold-digger Isabella.<br /><br />I very much recommend \\"Northanger Abbey\\" to read.  I have the strongest urge to write Jane Austen to tell her how much I appreciate her efforts.  What a pity I can't do something like that.  Now to dig up a popular film adaptation....and a copy of \\"Mysteries of Udolpho\\".
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app., specifically I love the variations of the bible that you can choose from as well as the number of reading plans to choose from.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was the best game ever. It showed me how to take care of my horse! I love it! It is so cool.
B007N6NGYG|3.0|It actually gets harder than I thought it would for a little game, but I only played it for a short time.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Lots of fun when I play this game. Takes me back to my childhood. Allows me to play mindlessly and escape reality.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Love it!! SO addictive!! Even my 4 year old can't stop playing it!! Graphics are great....It changes up a lot so you don't get bored!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Ive played all the hungry shark games and this is by far the best one yet! No ads, shark upgrades, awesome graphics!
1401224792|2.0|A stand-alone graphic novel from the Fables universe, Werewolves Of the Heartland features Bigby Wolf as he wanders across America looking for a new city to call home.  He comes across Story City, and, as fate would have it, it bears an inextricable link to our favorite Fable.<br /><br />Regular readers of Fables know that Bigby Wolf saw action during World War II, and this graphic novel spends a small amount of time reliving some of those moments.  However, the majority of the story takes place in Story City, and it involves, as the name would suggest, a society of werewolves against which Bigby must take action.<br /><br />I love the Fables series, and it usually doesn't miss, but Werewolves Of the Heartland is nonessential reading and, frankly, moves rather slowly as though trying to fill space.  The storyline is not especially engaging, nor are the characters particularly dynamic.  In fact, without his usually supporting characters, Bigby himself falls flat in this work.<br /><br />Furthermore, be warned, there is a lot of nudity in this book, both men and women alike.  I won't go so far as to say it's photorealistic, but the men and women remove their clothing before turning into werewolves, and the artists made sure to render them anatomically correct.  There are also a few moments of seduction that include nudity as well.  I'll be honest, like the story itself, much of the nudity felt unnecessary.<br /><br /> As apparent, I don't recommend Werewolves Of the Heartland.  As an avid reader of Fables, I believe you can bypass this work and still understand the main storyline just fine.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|What a wonderful twist and turn of a tale set in Italy.  Two of our favorite actors tell a sublime story of love and subtle intrigue.  Refreshing and Entertaining, considering that most of the movies today are CG-spectacular monstrosities that I am totally tired of.  Highly recommend this movie.
B007PZADLO|5.0|Absolutely love this vinyl record it gives a better sounding audio then a mp3 or CD, not to mention its TRAIN
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I just happened to have caught this on our local PBS station and was blown away by Hugh Laurie's musical Blues talent.  Who knew the man could sing & play like this?  I didn't!  Neither did my husband who is a fan of Hugh's 'House' series.  I do not care for 'Dixieland' jazz, I prefer bluesy jazz and this cd is packed with talent -- even a song with Tom Jones!  Wonderful!
0765325950|4.0|I have been reading this series for years.  Sanderson did a pretty good job of ending the series, but the pacing of the entire series has just been off with some books being almost unnecessary and very slow, and others rushing through the content.  I stuck with it out of pure determination to finish the series, but I have to say, I felt more relieved than satisfied at the end.
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|I'm not a musician in any form but was raised by a very good one. My personal classical collection consists of 100-200 Scarlatti (D) cassette tapes. I decided it was time to go back for some basics and chose to find a good Beethoven sonata set. (Yes, back to the chestnuts.) Since I am no judge of what's good from great, I read most every review and opinion possible to make sure I didn't get it wrong. This Kempff collection is so good that even I can tell it's special. The piano is perfection. There is no sense of Kempff being an entity separate from his instrument. It is seamless and seemingly perfect. I have no doubt that there are other wonderful sets out there, but this work should do it for just about everyone. Rated: Worth every dime.
B009GEEMLY|2.0|Boy, I know a lot of people loved this movie, but I really did not like it.  I am a much bigger fan of the X-Men movies.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|If I were glu mobile I would make eternity warriors 3 with multiplayer in campaign. I recommend this for people who like war. Other than that it is a completely awesome game.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|Unless you grew up in a cave somewhere, this blockbuster is a totally expected journey, being a continuation of Peter Jackson's LoTR series. Never mind that the events take place before the previous three movies, radical redesigns are not welcome here. Every cliffhanging moment has the characters cliffhanging for their very lives, scene after scene, down to their last fingernail. There's no modulation, no nuance. It's a roller coaster ride without a valley. It's a road trip through a flat-as-a-pancake Rocky Mountains. To say that it is good or bad is pointless. It is what it is. It's been delivered as expected, satisfaction guaranteed.
0810989956|5.0|My son wanted this when he saw it in the store.. saw it on Amazon for almost $6 cheaper (love!).  I remember liking these type of 'write-in' books when I was younger.  Inside the pages there's tons of pages that kids can write in themselves.  They ask questions, let them draw, etc.  My son is typically hard to please.. but he absolutely loves it.  Recommend!<br /><br />PS  For parents:  It's a great time capsule item to keep stored away for when the kids grow up. :)
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|By far one of the best movies I have seen in along time non-stop action and the 3d part is pretty sweet also.
B005UG53NS|5.0|I like the whole series but the last one is more of my speed.  Since my kids are watching it usually I don't enjoy their pics but the Harry potter series is to my liking, and the last is a more grown up version.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have always heard good things about this game so I decided to go buy it. This game is a little harder than the average get running game but it's addicting in the same way. As I said it's a fresh new challenge that keeps you on your toes. Of course it was free which I was doubtful about because free games aren't usually good but imangi studios nailed it. I would definitely recommend this app if you are a fan of fast paced action and challenge.
B00454U1NS|5.0|gotta love it. the unfortunate thing is that her music is getting better and now requires another &#34;greats&#34; album to satisfy.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|This is totally different and more violent than the movie, so make sure it is for adults or older kids.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case works great! I tested it under water, and no water leaked..<br /> I would recommend this to a friend! I give it a five star.. Great price for a great deal!<br />Defiantly will be buying more colors! Thank you! :)
630514415X|5.0|To be honest I skipped do the right thing and i'm glad I did after reading roger ebert's review of the movie I recently watched this movie on tv one and it was a good movie. Now on to the movie the story is interesting but I do think denzel washington's character pushed his son too hard which caused the argument that lead to the death of jesus's mother. I can totally relate to this film because in the movie jesus tells his father that he hates his name and I hate my name too so I found out we both have that in common.The scene where jesus goes one on one with his father at the end of the movie is one reason why you should buy this dvd.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|I just loved this show. Every single episode is funny and clever. Every character is loveable and so funny.  Has to be one of the greatest. Defently a must watch.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|The blend of fantasy and history is at its best with the first if this All Souls Trilogy. Fascinating characters!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Highly recommended just what I expected and more. Will be ordering more cases... Is really waterproof !!! Yes I did test case immediately
B006PERRMY|5.0|the first time i saw in-time i was just mildly amused, because i didn't pay enough attention. i did notice that the town of new-greenwich is named after the famous place in england where the day starts, or you might say time begins. (greenwich-mean-time) but i'm sure no one else in the theatre even noticed. then the timekeeper leon, (as in ponce-de...) says they'll solve the crime if they \\"follow the time\\" which is a take-off on the old adage, follow-the-money. again, no laughs in the theater. it's an intelligent movie, and goes right over the heads of most people in the demographic that goes to see sci-fi action.<br />but one evening recently, i watched it on dvd and got much more out of it. i finally noticed that the working-class town is called \\"dayton\\", and that the movie is full of double-entendres, sly jokes, and allusions. \\"maybe he thought it was a drive-through\\", \\"you shouldn't have\\", and \\"we look cute together\\".... but some scenes, like when salas tries and fails to save his mother, are actually poignant.<br />the style of the film helps keep it interesting. the odd colors, the sets, costumes, and and most of the characters are cartoon-like. but this \\"unreal\\" quality gives it flavor, cachet. if niccoll wanted it to just seem every-day \\"real\\" he'd certainly have the women kick off those stiletto heels before they run for their lives. also, if you're old enough to remember, the swimming scene is very like, (possibly an open tribute to) logan's run, the other film where implanted time clocks controll the characters.<br />now, i'm wondering, what more am i still missing?<br />lastly, and very importantly, like all good sci-fi, it has a message. the movie says pretty loud and clear, that extreme, killing poverty, and extreme, insane wealth are wrong. I agree, and this niccoll is a very good movie maker.
1434440826|5.0|It is truly one of the most interesting and fascinating books I 've ever read!!! Yet, if you have very good vision don't buy the cheap one, It has terrible print job and your eyes will hurt trying to read it.<br /><br />A book you should definitely own.<br />Cheers
B00B23O96A|3.0|First of all, let it be known that I'm a Clapton fan.  I have all of his CD's and even his worse are not so bad.  This CD, to me, shows an evolving Clapton, whereby his music is changing to reflect his age.  This isn't a bad thing, but the days of blistering lead guitar are for the most part over.  So, if you're rating this album by what's not on it, you're missing the point.  Clapton has a range that's far and above other blues guitarist.  His mellow ballads are smooth and clean, and the melodies are wonderful.  So why 3 stars?  Simply because these aren't songs written by Clapton, and there's something lost in that.  Perhaps a couple more listenings and I'll like it better.
0307463745|5.0|This is a great book which breaks many of the standard business advice given by other books. It's an easy read and written by people who have actually be successful in real business, not just in theory.

B008HK3XKO|5.0|A great option at a less expensive price. I love this case and its durability. It isn't excessively bulky and I like the strap for closure. I have no complaints. A great option for a lower priced case for the Fire.
0345803507|5.0|At first, I was very skeptical of reading these books. I finally decided to read them, and I am SO glad that I did!! I loved all three books. It took me about 24 hours to read the entire 3rd book!! Can't wait to see if E. L. James decides to re-write them from Christian's perspective.
B00021HBGS|4.0|My son has had a blast with these. My only complaint is that over time, some of the pieces tend to warp or lose their &#34;flattness&#34; and then are unable to stay on the tub and walls. But overall, a really good time and a LOT of pieces. I would order another set for sure.
0345803493|5.0|I didn't want to read the trilogy at first, but decided to give it a try. Very glad that I did!! I LOVED all three books... took me less than a week to read book 2 and only 1 day to finish the third book!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Great movie and love the additional production video.  It was interesting and added insight into making the movie.  I will watch it often.
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed all three of the &#34;Fifty&#34; Books!! The books are written very well and it is hard to put them down! I read the first book in 7 days, the second in about 5 1/2 days and the third book took 1 day!! Can't wait to see if they are re-written from Christian's point of view!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was a wonderful read... def. one that you just couldnt put down til you were finished. hot hot hot
B005IT0V8O|5.0|I had to read this for a class, but it was quite good. Some parts are a bit outdated, but the spirit of the book is very snarky and open-minded, so you don't feel bad at all for disregarding some of the things it suggests. I got it on my Kindle, but I think I would like it more as a physical book, so that it's easier to follow cross-references, and flip through.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was curious from the beginning because of the title and what a great series, I had a difficult time putting it down!
B001NA6096|5.0|It's romantic, free, and really makes you think about life. The dialogue, screenplay, and acting is phenomenal in my opinion. Definitely one of my favorite movies because I agree with lots of the things they say. They say them so beautifully.

B00005JKHN|4.0|Whoa-watching my favorite childhood movies as a grown up...it wasn't great to watch Aurora be saved by a prince, but we watched Brave shortly after.  I am careful to balance harmless princess fantasies with the reality of the value of women; for a four year old, this one is fine.<br />Condition excellent, arrived almost before I pushed &#34;confirm order&#34;.  Wonderful seller experience.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  If you're looking for something new to read, I'd highly recommend Sarah's Key.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|I thought the movie was really good. It was really funny, but I like crude humor.  Yes, it wasn't the best movie in the world, but I really enjoyed it.
B00BF123WG|4.0|We enjoyed it a lot.  If you are a terrorist or a liberal you probably won't.  If you are a great American and believe in your country and our rights, you should enjoy this.  It was well done, the acting was very good.  portrays the government bureaucracy very well.
B000O5B4C4|3.0|Good flick but it suffers from a weak screenplay in the end, basically the entire premise is ridiculous. Michael Douglous doesn't come off as the type of sleazy cop that would be so unprofessionally immoral as to commit such activities.

0062267787|5.0|Love these short stories but wish there were more of them or that they were longer.  I would say it is a must read for the Delerium series.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|This movie was extremely rushed, trying to follow a plot line of a game that they failed to grasp even in the slightest. This failed to capture the concept of the game at all. It felt sloppy, like they were desperately trying to connect the 3rd game to the first movie and failed miserably. And don't get me started on the Vincent love interest. This whole movie is full of cliches and its sickening. They replaced Douglas roll with Vincent, completely ruining two of the best characters in the game. And the acting, oh my the acting was atrocious. Vincent was trying too hard to be Romeo, and Douglas (for the 2 seconds he was in the movie) was horrible. I really liked the first movie, and though it wasn't perfect, I would still call it one of the best video game movie adaptions ever made. But this? This movie is atrocious and a disgrace to the Silent Hill Franchise. And dare I even mention that final fight? And pyramid head was Alessa's guardian? It's bad enough to even add pyramid head in this movie... but that is awful. And that epic hug scene on the carousel? Man, this movie was fantastic... not.<br /><br />There were a few good things in this movie. One cool little detail was that Claudia had no eyebrows and no shoes, following well with her character model in the game. Second were the nurses. The nurses were extremely well done and creepy. And third, the \\"other world\\" atmospheres were pretty awesome, and they had a few good atmosphere shots.<br /><br />Overall, coming from a hardcore fan of the game series, I found this movie horrible and disappointing. Be weary before watching this, especially if you are a fan of the games. I hope that they will stop the atrocities here, and not attempt to butcher another fantastic game's portrayal of Silent Hill (especially not Downpour, I saw that bus at the end, I'm keeping my eye on you).
0142421715|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy.  It was written so well and I could not put it down!  I would recommend this book to anyone.  It is really for all ages!
0517543052|5.0|Remember, Be Here Now from Baba Ram Dass truly changed my life.  In the middle of a phase in my life of manic depression and incredible indescribable despair .. someone who will now forever remain a brother in my heart brought this book to me along with keys to unlock my own perception in order to understand it.  After nearly two years of battling within myself and conquering the inner demons of perception the understanding of Baba's message and his profound system contained here opened up for me once and for all.  Get through the whole thing, take it ALL as meditation and REMEMBER, BE HERE NOW.  This book can transform you into that being you were born to be, but only if you take it as it is.
0062014536|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who likes dystopian books.  Such as Hunger Games, Divergent and Matched!  I am almost finished with this book and really enjoy it.
B00B671VYU|3.0|Like another reviewer has said, Lordi is a guilty pleasure of mine. Definitely not for everyone, but they're right up my alley.<br /><br />Having said that, they've managed to release some stellar albums. Nothing I would rank as an overall favourite album among other artists, but they're pretty memorable with the cheesy lyrics and, of course, monster image. There hasn't been an album of theirs I didn't like. Even my least favourite (Babez for Breakfast) has quite a bit going for it. This one continues the tradition.<br /><br />I heard the first single (The Riff) before the album was available in North America, and after a listen or two it grew on me (the video is incredible, by the way - you have to see it to believe it). After listening to the rest of the cd, it's obvious that they really changed their style, which is to be expected since they replaced two members, including one that's been there from their first album. What I didn't expect, however, was some of the songs running the gamut from stellar to downright awful to the extreme that it does. Some songs jumped out at you and easily rank among their best work (Candy for the Cannibal, Horrifiction). In an unusual offering from Lordi, others are a bit sloppy yet still catchy (The Riff, We're Not Bad For The Kids (We're Worse)). Finally, this cd continues the tradition of Lordi having one song on the cd I can't stand (I Luv Ugly). The rest were too cheesy to be taken seriously, yet were entertaining enough to guarantee more listens to the cd.<br /><br />It's a cd I'll definitely play often, and will most likely come to love like their others. But Lordi has some work to do to get back to what they gave us with the music they gave us on the string of cds from Monsterican Dream through to Deadache. I'm sure they'll strike gold with their next one. Until then, I'll happily listen to what they've given us up till now. Including this one.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I got the biggest headache listening to this cd. There's definitely some unique and nice sounds here, but it just goes on and on and on.<br /><br />JT's had 7-plus minute songs before, but unlike \\"What Goes Around\\" and \\"Lovestoned\\" - songs which change direction and justify the long length, these songs just keep doing the same things until you just can't take it anymore.<br /><br />I'm glad JT doesn't just do the usual 4 1/2 minute song, but I was expecting much more than just repetitive noise. Again, there is a basis for some great music here, but it just goes on way too much for my taste.<br /><br />I would suggest going to Target and getting the cd with the two extra songs. They're much closer to Justin's usual style of music than anything else here.
0061119725|5.0|Great product with wonderful large pictures.  Nice thick pages and is easy to read along with children and easy for their little fingers to maneuver as well.

B00BF123WG|3.0|Very slow and dragged at times.  Anticlimactic and just fizzled out at the end.  I wouldn't recommend unless you've got time to waste.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good graphics storyline and unique hidden object and other puzzles and games. Nice special pricing for Kindle .99 thru April 1. THANKS.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Engaging characters in an almost realistic setting making this a wonderful reprieve of a book. The read made for a relaxing Sunday, and I'll be on the lookout for the next Mira Lyn Kelly book.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Too short because you cut it off, because it was free, but didn't seem to be worth 4.99. But it was too soon in the game to tell when it cut off, it would have to be a really GOOD game to pay that much.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|Comes in the absolute flimsiest case you can possibly imagine.  Hindsight, I should've bought from Best Buy for the same price and got a real case for it.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|When I read this book I couldn't put it down.  I read some of the reviews that said the same thing and didn't believe them. I'm a tough one when it comes to that but it was so true.  The author really wrote an excellent book that captures your attention and emotions.
B0097S0TM0|4.0|I really like to listen to Pink. She makes such great music. Its fun and gets yoiu moving. Favorite song is Try...
0062183591|3.0|The author did a great job of making his points about dishonesty in the first half of the book. Great insights. Lots and lots of research that seemed to be thoughtfully designed. However, I found myself growing weary half way through the book reading all of the studies. He could have been more engaging. One of those books that you think might have been better if it had been shorter.
0307352153|5.0|In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking, Susan Cain discovered that, \\"one third to one half of Americans are introverts\\" (Page 3). Susan Cain admits that she is an introvert. Most of the world tends to look down on people who are quiet and we call them shy. Quiet individuals are also many times compared to extroverts and they wonder why we can't be more outgoing like them. The book is well researched and is backed up with tons of statistics and studies to support her points. Susan Cain has found that people who are quiet enjoy working alone instead of with a group. Introverts can be highly sensitive. Introverts dislikes small talk and would prefer to be in more depth in conversations and topics that inspire them and they connect with. Introverts are more incline to pause and think before they speak because they don't like to cause conflict. Extroverts are the opposite they sometimes don't think before they speak and they don't always listen to what introverts have to share. The book will prove that the world needs both types of people to contribute to the wellbeing of the world.<br /><br />Some of the introverted people displayed in the book were, Rosa Parks, Albert Einstein, J.K. Rowling, Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), Eleanor Roosevelt, Al Gore, Warren Buffett, Gandhi, Moses, Charles Darwin, and many more. Some of the extroverts were: Martin Luther King, Jr., Oprah, Dale Carnegie, President George W. Bush, Tony Robbins, Bill Clinton, and many more. The book will describe some of these famous people stories in vast details.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes was an overview of the differences between introverts and extroverts:<br /><br />\\"Human extroverts have more sex partners than introverts do- a boon to any species wanting to reproduce itself-but they commit more adultery and divorce more frequently, which is not a good thing for the children of all the couplings. Extroverts exercise more, but introverts suffer fewer accidents and traumatic injuries. Extroverts enjoy wider networks of social support, but commit more crimes (Page 148).<br /><br />Susan Cain explored and travelled to public and private schools in Georgia, New York, and Michigan to see how teachers are conducting their classroom settings. A great number of teachers are believing that having group work prepares students for the business world and it teaches them to work together for a common goal. One classroom Susan visited had a sign on the wall that said, \\"You Can't Ask a Teacher for Help Unless Everyone in Your Group has the Same Question\\" (Page 77). Another teacher made a quiet student become the safety patrol for a day where he would have an opportunity to become a leader too. But does everyone need to be a leader, don't we need followers too.<br /><br />A gigantic thing that I enjoyed was the section at the end of the book entitled, \\"Resources for Readers\\". Susan Cain communal tips for parents with introverted children, educators, and public speaking for introverts. One of the tips that I thought was really helpful was encouraging your child when they seek out new activities, interactions, and friendships. Let them know you saw the courage they demonstrated and you're proud of them. If they are frightened to try new things make sure to start small and don't push your child too quickly. Another big tip was don't call your child shy because most of the time our children take it as criticism and it will damage their self-esteem.<br /><br />I would recommend this brilliant well researched book to anyone who feels ashamed of being introverted or they feel bad that they are called shy. Extroverts would greatly benefit from reading this book to better understand the importance of having introverts in the business field. I immensely loved the contrast shown between being introverted and extroverted and the reminder that one isn't better than the other. I loved how Susan Cain actually travelled to different events and places to understand how different locations handle people who are introverted in an extroverted world. The book deeply inspired me to love my personality type. I'm an introvert and I realized that I think and work better alone than when I'm in a group sharing ideas. I have also noticed that if I'm passionate about a topic I will talk more and be willing to share my opinions and concerns. If you're looking for a book that will change your perspective on the importance of needing both introverts and extroverts, then book will inspire and encourage you to accept each other completely.<br /><br />\\"I received this copy of Quiet for free from Random House/ WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review\\".stand how different locations handle people who are introverted in an extroverted world.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|This show was a slow build on me. Really enjoy it now, excited to see where it goes. Not quite as good as Breaking Bad, Mad Men, or House of Cards, but entertaining none-the-less.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game the kids love it to. Can't keep the boys from playing it. The girls love it also. Recommended for great fun.

B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|The only problem was the game freezing up at level 4.<br />I really enjoy the game.  It froze up and I still kept on playing.  I became faster getting to level 4 and finally I made it thru level 4.<br />My grandkids like it too.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|IT is a fun game, but not a game that makes you want to play. Which I really appreciate. I like the challenge, and the contrast. I would recommend this game for elementary school aged children, as there is not a lot of stimulus, no violence, and I related the black goo to pollution in the Sea.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is a great way to eat many things that you would not be able to eat in real life. There's turtle soup, a vast array of sushi and even cannibalism lol. Good for those who love to eat but hate to work off the pounds later

B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book was inspiring about love and devotion. The one thing a didn't like is that it switched from Cassia to Ky.<br />I can't imagine a redo to be better than this.<br />I loved it very much and will someday read it again.<br />This book was awesome.
1449389627|5.0|Read it. If you want to foster creativity in the hope of doing something truly innovative, read this book. It offers ideas and helps you to take a different angle as to what is required to enable creativity.<br /><br />I think one of the most important lesson is that there is no single formula. What helps be be creative won't necessarily work for my colleagues. As a leader, if I want my staff to be creative, I have to create an atmosphere where they can feel free to try new things and collaborate in an environment that works best for them and not myself.
B001G8WBNO|5.0|A great read, I loved the detail of the era. It moves in such a way that you totally understand what the girk is feeling and thinking at all times. And you want to continue to know more about her.  She is very mysterious. to those around her and she tries to keep it that way.
0895292211|5.0|I purchased this book after learning about Dr Edward Howell from Victoria Boutenko. Not only does it explain enzymes, but the consequences of not consuming enzymes. In addition Dr Edward Howell presents valuable information about the implications of consuming sugar, irradiated products, and other high risk foods.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This read was very entertaining. I've always enjoyed reading romance novels. What a wonderful way to pass the time on a Sunday evening.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|Took my 47 year old, to quench her need for to see a `cutesy' prehistoric animation, I must say I was pleasantly surprised the film was rather good. The narrative is engaging and the animation is some the best I have seen lately. As another reviewer has said the story is quite funny in the way it deals with fear of the unknown, being alone and life in general when you trying just to survive to the next day. Your inner child should really like this film, well worth a very good five stars. I must say my 47 year old was very well behaved!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Just an awesome and fun game, great graphics and challenging scenes but not to hard. Recommend this highly for hidden object game lovers.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best series I have ever viewed!<br />Wonderful writing!<br />Superb acting!<br />A truly great setting!<br />The period autos were the best I've seen!
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|As an accomplished Toastmaster, and instructor and committee member of TEDxYouth@FortWorth, I can say that this book hits all of key points to developing and delivering a dynamic and memorable TED Talk.  A TED Talk is not a high school speech, it is not a business presentation, and it is certainly not bland and impersonal.  Speaking at a TED event is about building a deep connection with the audience by tying in personal, relatable experiences and stories to a single core message; this book covers how to do that and more, but with nothing wasted on ineffective or irrelevant (for a TED Talk) speech writing.  While not a general speech primer, \\"How to Deliver the Perfect TED Talk . . .\\" fulfills its purpose, and is a fantastic supplement for any skilled speaker wanting to step-up to TED.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Loved it.  Great show.  Watched the entire season in almost one day.  I'm going to finish the series and read the books next!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I only became aware of this series (from friends) when it was in the third season.  I watched on PBS and recording when I could not see it at the broadcast time.  Then, I went back and caught up with the previous seasons.  That worked well and was a good way to see it.<br /><br />Personally, I simply do not like the way of life of the English upper class.  This series did not change my mind, but it was very well done, and as far as I can tell seemed to give a good view of a time gone by.  It was great to find this available on Amazon.  The neat thing is that I can go back and check things I missed.  Hearing and understanding what is said is tricky.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|A couple of funny scenes, but mostly it was 2 hour+ movie about people yelling and screaming at each other. What a waste of great cast. You know you've screwed the pooch as director when the most appealing performance was Meagan Fox.
B005T87QCI|5.0|You should get the best game ever you can build your own robot to.you can by atom,black Jack.it is definitely Worth 5 stars .

B000NY12CI|5.0|Wonderful read. Made me rethink my position on Muslims. I now understand the my strong belief in freedom of religion may actually have caused me to \\"look the other way\\" as women and girls are abused and children are shaped to deliver or accept that abuse. I still want our country to be one that accepts  human differences, but not.at the expense of safety and the freedom of thought and expression.
B0000X61VE|5.0|Great workout.  Warm up routines are excellent.  Sometimes a little too fast but is very thorough and comprehensive.<br />Liked the change in venues and music.

I don't have a xbox or I would have minecraft. my computer is to old to get minecraft on it. I am ticked off.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Though I do not have children in the house anymore, I enjoy these new animations and the lessons they impart to our youth. This movie was very impactful in that it showed the dangers of neglecting the planet on which we live. Even with it's deep meanings and messages, it was a very cute movie.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|book is written as short letter's to an unknown person.  While it took a while for me to enjoy the style of writing, the book was good.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Too much violence for our children and for us! The message of the movie was never very clear. It was not an uplifting movie at all!!

B0090SI3ZW|1.0|I had hopes...not overly high, but hopes nonetheless.  I even bought the DVD before seeing the movie (when I think it might be a bad movie, I'll rent first).  I was woefully dissapointed.  The plot was poorly conveyed.  The action, even with the stylistic gore, was actually bland.  With the cast I had hoped for much more.  None of the actors seemed to be interested in the story...sleep walking through the scenes.  This was easily one of the worst movies I've seen this year.  The DVD is already on my donation to Good Will pile.

B005M2A4D4|5.0|Love Dr. Who, love Matt Smith the Eleventh Doctor and more than anything I love the River Song storyline.  Heartbreaking and beautiful, exciting and engaging.  This show has everything but spectacular special effects.  The FX are often cheesy and corny but the acting and storylines are so powerful you just don't care :)
B00BWJARHO|3.0|This movie was a disappointment when compared to The Lord of the Rings.  I found the acting poor, the character's relationships weren't built up in a way that helped me relate this to The Lord of the Rings...I just think this movie was not for me.  I'm sure others who are more into this sort of thing will love it.  But its not for me.  Wishing I would have rented a different film.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|Great story, told well with excellent dialogue.  The acting is superior from all characters.  Sets and costumes are fantastic and the cinematography is grand.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Muy apropiada para personas con dificultad de vision. Numeros grandes y las funciones necesarias. La recomiendo para personas mayores y para ninos tambien.
B000R8YC1S|5.0|Okay it's a little dated and a little fantastical.  But it has David Bowie looking hot, rocking a crazy mullet dressed as the Goblin King.  C'mon, who doesn't want to see that?  Plus it's a fun story with just enough humor to keep you interested through some of the slower parts.  Kids love it,
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book has lots of twists and turns - kept me guessing until the end.  Great character development. Very well written and easy to get lost in. Looking forward to reading more from Blake Crouch!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Cold Mountain is a classic to be seen by all... No matter you feel about the civil war, this is based on a family.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Quality animation along with a great message make this a nice family movie.  My kids and really enjoyed it. This is one I would own.
B002ECQB46|5.0|This movie was amazing because I have had a girl obsessed with me, so I know what the dude was going through.  He was doing anything wrong just loved his wife and was in a sticky situation!

B0030MM68O|4.0|Didn't really know much about the how the bomb squad worked, especially in a military setting; so this movie was very entertaining!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very addicting game. I can't get far but it's still fun to play.  I think my kids like it more than I do.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  Couldn't have asked for a better depiction of the history during that era.  Even the actors looked just like the people of that time. Ben Affleck is a superb director.  If you loved this movie then definitely give The Town a whirl!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a good love story in a beautiful setting and all worked out for the best for the Dad, the kids and the one they all loved.
0399226907|5.0|this is a gift to great grand child  I have given this book to all my grand children so no review
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Cliched I know but did battle to put it down. I cant think of a single book he has written tat I did not enjoy
B0050DIWFC|5.0|well written,an unusual treatment of a current subject&#34; in the news&#34;<br />legal parts were of interest and the ending a surprise,but it was<br />the answer!!!
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Cliched I know but did battle to put it down. I cant think of a single book he has written tat I did not enjoy.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|Even though it is still winter here, Luke gets your heart rate going and ready to party.  So looking forward to the summer.  Everyone needs a spring break.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|My son was wondering why I was standing up while watching the 5 minutes of &#34;flight&#34; during the movie. Next thing I know he's standing next to me more frozen - looking at the big screen - than I was. We have a 5.1 audio theater tied into our wide screen TV - all I can say is WOW! The rest of the movie is pretty good, but the flight scene is incredible. 4 stars - well worth watching, but make sure you don't have little kids watching or people who are nervous about flying.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I haven't quite finished it.  Found it interesting but found some of the medical and technical terms hard for me to understand
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Lots of twists and turns and of course the good guys wins and gets the girl ending. Worth Watching if you like these type of movies.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Missed some of the episodes on PBS so wanted to have this DVD.  Love the show and probably will watch it over and over.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I discovered Baldacci by accident but now look forward to reading more of his stories.  Definitely adventure, suspence but well written and great pace.  Very good escape reading.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book but not as much as some of the other Nicholas Sparks books I have read in the past
B00BESM14U|5.0|This is a beautifully acted film and the director unfolds the plot in a beautiful way as well.  Though the main characters are in high school, it's a story that people of any age can relate to.  As testament to that, I'm a grandmother who could still identify with the characters in this movie who so beautifully illustrate the wounds - and capacity for compassion that we all carry within us.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|I had a good time watching it.<br />As entertainment all the transformer movies are a good deal.<br />This one is no exception.
B0076DELIG|5.0|It was good read.  Always enjoy Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch.  Always waiting for a new one to come out.
B0078XHAB4|4.0|A pleasant read and I chose 4 star as it wouldn´t be in my best read list, but would recommend
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I enjoyed this book although I didn't think it was quite as good as his previous books in this series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Never expected this book to be so heartbreakingly good.  I could not put the book down. This is a story that will stay with me long after my tears are dry.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is better than the first because you get to explore more places and jump over obstacles and hang on ropes. so addicting and so fun!!!!!!! :)
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I use this daily!  My wife and I both follow the same account and we track e everything on here. We have it on all our devices.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book will instill into your soul forever if you will let you mine, body and heart feel the works that you read. It will stop you in your responds before you speak. A<br />So I found a relation in some of the stories, and now I am able to understand more of being able to let go of the thing I could not control that really I was not able to do so before. Just thought that I had to. Being able to forgive and let go of the pain and to build a beer history to look back on by living in the moments. My blood pressure has even gotten way better since reading this. Thank you!
B008MM9630|1.0|This game is boring!! I can't believe it won't download first! I waited 15 minutes, and that was ridiculous! I do recommend this game for young children who like to work on farms but for me it's boring.<br /><br />Love: Camryn (Girl)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have 3 kids under 3 and I still couldn't put it down.  Now that's high praise. Please enjoy the read.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Renée Zellweger and Ewan McGregor do such a great job.  I love period pieces and Beatrix Potter’s books and art work are so amazing.  For a moment, you can see how very creative people could gain their inspiration from the smallest of things. A great movie.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I think that this is a good app for kids.  I think all parents should get this for their children
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|i think this is his best album to date. His last album was a bit depressing. I am hooked on the Raven!
B007N6NGYG|3.0|At first charming, then frustrating, and back again. Train Crisis is fun and addictive puzzle game with comical ways to show you've gotten it wrong. This game is for anyone who enjoys a new take on an old classic.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Two of the greatest movies of all time, some good extras and a third movie that could have been up with the other two with some tweaks. Still, this is simply great.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We enjoyed the second season as much as the first and third.  We are now up to date.<br />Now ready for season four.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|My wife really loves this movie. Its a good comedy movie without a lot of cursing like you see in Seth Rogan movies. I would definitely recommend this movie to others.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Its an okay film with predictable story line. Wish they would have given proper credit to Canadians for their real part in saving these diplomats.<br />It was worth $3.99 on Amazon but definitely NOT  a &#34;Best Picture of the Year&#34; movie.
B0090EIILU|1.0|Just a waste of time with trying to make a joke on a culture. Just lacking the originiality. Poor humor
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Great cinematography but this movie especially the second half seems to take days .<br />Not exactly  light happy movie entertainment.
B007Y1S2HQ|5.0|These are cover songs performed by Rumer.  The beauty of her voice is something to really mellow out on!  She covers everything from Jimmy Webb, Todd Rundgren, Hall & Oates, and Gilbert O'Sullivan.<br /><br />The music on this release is all top notch and if you are a fan of Rumer you will enjoy the way she pays tribute with her signature vocals!  This woman is just a major breakout singer waiting to be discovered by the music buying masses in America!!  Rumer is pure talent with the voice of an angel and someday she will get the recognition she deserves!
B008ASGP3U|4.0|I am a fan of mysteries,I especially like John Rebus, the protagonist<br />in The Ian Rankin  novels. His novels are well defined, John Rebus is a rebel and one who<br />will never change.If you have an affinity for mysteries and or scottish writers, I highly recommend<br />Ian Rankin.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is riveting. Once you start watching it reels you in like a fish on a hook. I found myself wondering how the characters were doing and what would come next at any given moment of the day. This is truly great acting with a fantastic script. The scenery is impressive as well as the first hand look at history. Great series!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I think this one hails back to some of his earlier work. I`m not sure he has another &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; in him, but this one was enjoyable and easy to read. I like the quirks and turns.
B004H6G0TI|3.0|This game is alright... but on my tablet the quality wasn't the best. To me... I don't think it's worth downloading. :/
B000XUBF3I|5.0|Wow.. This book makes all the difference in how I look at housework now... It is a treasure that I'm sure I will read over and over.. I downloaded on my ipad and am so glad so I can never lose it!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Overall the book is entertaining I did not anticipate the outcome. It is clearly a book for teenagers, although I am not one, I enjoyed it anyway. It does have a few sex scenes that might not be proper for young readers.
1250006341|5.0|I've never watched Downton Abbey---it's not really something I'd enjoy.  However, a friend of mine LOVES the program, so I bought a copy of this book for a birthday present.  It's  a book that's really well put together, and the photography is beautiful.  Needless to say, it was a huge hit.  Highly recommended.
B003PIUC02|5.0|The First Season of an epic series.  Though I enjoyed the series overall.  It may be to intense for many people.
B004OZZ624|3.0|I found this movie to have a slow pace for an action flick. The plot also had little depth to it.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|A nice interlude to the original story, with the great tie-in for Season 2.  I personally enjoyed the Spartacus series, though it may be hardcore and graphic for many.
B0091QS88K|5.0|I have twin boys that are 3 and they love this game. I would recommend it to anyone with kids!
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Liam McIntyre did a fantastic job filling the shoes of Andy Whitfield.  A great sequel to Season 1 and sets the stage for the final season.
B001O1O71C|3.0|I thought this book was pretty good, but very predictable.  I had just read The Book Thief, which was incredible.
0545259088|5.0|Yes these books move slow. I like the writing style. I adore the characters. Fantasy love story with a little adventure.
B0058BI896|5.0|I really love the show and characters, I hope it last many more seasons.  I own all of them so far.
B008578PRK|2.0|It was okay. Yes it's scary. Just wish there was more of a story line. Acting in it is great and the house is wonderful. Love the road that disappears.
B000007638|5.0|Just so you don't have pay these ungodly prices because you think it's out of print this is available on ebay for $25.00
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I like every song which is rare.  Nate's voice is tremendous. Serious subjects sung light hearted and yet painful. It is a hard thing to pull off. This album is also recorded very well.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This trilogy is a must see. Three great movies all in one set. The third movie may be a little slow, but you need to watch all three.
0545123275|5.0|Yes these books move slow. I like the writing style. I adore the characters. Fantasy love story with a little adventure.
B00AE2I4WK|1.0|Can't give a great review, were never able to watch the movie as we kept getting an amazon error. Called and weren't able to resolve. Still got to pay though
0316077054|5.0|Great series. Yes, the movie was terrible if you read the books. Ama a librarian indeed. Please. There are 4 books. All wonderful. A fantasy adventure. A love story. Lots of cooking. Rich colorful writing style.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|The first couple of chapters were slow. The trial transcript was difficult to follow. But Ms. Haynes had a subtle way of holding on to my interest until I was positively riveted I found myself sneaking reads when I should have been doing something else because I just had to know what happened next. I definitely would want to read more by this author.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Bought it because of a couple of hits. Most of the album is very good. Some songs are wonderul. Go Black Keys!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book (and good movie). Covers a variety of teen issues, but is written with complex characters and not with the usual whiny crap associated with teen movies. Good enough to hold the interest of adults.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|The recording is quirky. Her voice is wonderful, and almost every song is cool. Mostly a slow to medium tempo album so need to be in that mood. Saw them on SNL, and I was blown away.
B003Y5H5JM|5.0|Wonderful and gorgeous movie. Just watch it (unless you are a Shakespeare hater). Helen Mirren can play anything and is fantastic as usual.
0545123291|5.0|Yes these books move slow. I like the writing style. I adore the characters. Fantasy love story with a little adventure.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Lovely CD, ordered and despatched quickly.<br />Ordered as a gift with CD player and this too was despatched quickly.<br />Will use site again.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I have the uncensored one so it's not good to play around little kids. Actually the album is about sex and relationships. Great tunes though. He is wonderfully talented. Great voice.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fantastic read.  Not to give anything away, but the 2nd book is really good.  I totally recommend to book clubs.
B003MZ0I84|4.0|I really enjoy the music of Maroon 5.  I received the tape on the date it was stated it would be.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful.....this is Pendergast as you've never seen him before.  of all the special agent's stories this one takes the cake...if you love suspense thrillers this is a must read
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I lost interest after they killed the girl. I got the feeling that this guys were trying out for a three stooges sequel. Everything they did got screwed up. I guess it was more true to life than I wanted. Sean never let the gorgeous girls he swore to keep safe get killed off, did he?
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Sounds like something that I would be able to fit into my schedule. Bodyweight exercise is great new exercise I have run into.
B009CPES4I|3.0|Nothing sparkling about it. Same thing about ignorant white people. Thought it was ok for a Rainy day.just ok not great.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|**UPDATE** I originally bought one of these and had some pretty terrible bottleneck issues. After reading my original review the people from Anker Direct took it upon themselves to contact me and to try to resolve my issue with the device. They promptly sent me a replacement (even before I asked for it) and provided a pre-paid return label for the one I bought. That is some impressive customer service right there. I'm also happy to inform that the replacement adapter works great.
B00BF11STU|4.0|The Taliban should be able to increase their volunteers after they see this. I bet Cheney had a New Years hat and kazoo when he was watching this.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Very disappointing series.  Will tell others not to bother reading. Story is weak and pretty much boring.  Save your money.
B00BHMF578|5.0|That it was based on a true story and showed what we did to piss off the Iranians to get them this mad at us was refreshing. Hopefully the next generation will read history and understand what Karma is.
075695195X|5.0|A very interesting and fun read. Bartimaeus is an unforgettable character and very witty. Well done Jonathan Stroud for a well invented young adult, fantasy novel. I ended up enjoying this book more than I thought I would.<br />When I first started reading, the pace was a bit...well, I guess scattered is the best way to put it. But Stroud quickly picks up the pieces and creates a unique and thorough environment and story. The book is written in two styles. The first is first person with Bartimaeus. He is a djinn with quick wit and lots of random thoughts (which the author even added as footnotes). The other is third person and focuses on Nathaniel. He is a magician's apprentice who summons Bartimaeus for a small case of revenge.<br />The story bounces between these two as the adventure moves along and a little game of revenge gets to be so much more than either thought it could. Bartimaeus starts off warning the boy early on that he was over his head...what an understatement. Or is it? Truly a good read.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|great hidden object mini games and story! Definitely worth the play and purchase. We Will be purchasing more of this series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a very entertaining, very well written, CLEAN show. I am recommending it to all of my friends and family.
B006LSZECO|5.0|kept me glued and the story was great as were the characters<br />and i will read gillian flynn when i find another book
1419701533|5.0|I got this for my daughter who is really into these books. She loves them, and is excited to read because of them.
0385344228|5.0|very well written and excellent story and an ending which was certainly unexpected<br /><br />I enjoyed all the characters and how they were portrayed
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this book!  I just hope he hurries with the rest of the books!
B00991TCOG|5.0|(review is actually by Leonard's wife)<br /><br />I was first introduced to Lindsey Stirling by a friend who posted one of her videos on Facebook on Christmas 2012. I clicked links to listen to more, and discovered she was going on tour. I picked up the album at the concert in March 2013, and it's my favorite disc! She plays violin, with a keyboardist and drummer for backup. Some of the songs are dubstep, while some seem more suited to belly dance and others to Irish step dance.<br /><br />\\"Electric Daisy Violin\\" is a bright, bouncy piece. \\"Zi-Zi's Journey\\" might be my favorite, but it's hard to decide; the melody alternates between voice (no lyrics) and violin, and it feels like traveling. \\"Crystallize\\" is a beautiful, ethereal melody with dubstep beat. At the concert, this piece nearly brought me to tears.<br /><br />\\"Song of the Caged Bird\\" is inspired by Maya Angelou's poem, and really gets across the feeling of longing and entrapment, but still holding onto hope. The sound is heavier on drum than most of the others, but still focused on melody. \\"Moon Trance\\" could be part of the soundtrack for a suspence film, with ominous keyboard and pizzicato. \\"Minimal Beat\\" and \\"Transcendence\\" are more upbeat, as is \\"Spontaneous Me.\\" \\"Elements\\" is another dubstep, with changes in tone to evoke water, fire, air, and earth. \\"Shadows\\" is more cheerful than the title would suggest. \\"Anti-Gravity\\" actually feels like floating. \\"Stars Align\\" is the only one with clear lyrics, but still only one line, \\"when the stars align.\\" It makes me feel like everything is going right.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Although Martin can write well and pulls you in with some interesting characters and gripping scenes, this book and others in the series are too long, wordy and convoluted.  Martin tends follow a character to a point then without resolution switches to another character you've never heard of and starts building a far fetch tale with them. You'll be flipping pages in irritation just to get through dense verbosity.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|What a disappointment.Season one was so good. Season 2 is awful. I won't even watch the reast of it. ugh
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this out of boardum and i got glued to it it pretty fun, you jump on trains and and have to duck under and jump over different locks while running from dogs and cops and trying to get coins and different power ups it was not at all what i was expecting but its entertaining
B002UWH8P6|4.0|Very different from the other Stargate TV shows, but very well-written and directed.  I enjoyed the character development and emphasis on survival and inter-personal relationships as opposed to everyone always coming together to face some new alien menace.
B008XG1X18|4.0|this satisfies my pinteresting if im sitting on the train or board in an office but still doesnt not compare to the web
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great fun loving game anyone can play you don't have to be smart to play this just play your game.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Aside it being adorable I can easily find it. Now that my baby is six months he shakes the monkey around too cute.
1594481717|5.0|As an administrator in the elementary setting, the importance of the arts, as pointed out in this book, is essential to the development of our young people. This is an energizing read and one that I refer to during my class at Webster University to allow our newest crop of educators to be ready to grow critical thinkers with curious and creative minds. I highly recommend this book for administrators, education professors, policy makers and curriculum specialists.
0307719774|5.0|This book is very fun, with just random questions. Some are easily answered and some not so much. I liked this book so much that I decided to buy one for a friend as well. I absolutely love this journal!
0345472322|5.0|Most likely, you will see yourself and others in one of these categories or a blend of both. The internal and external motivation for both mind sets is fascinating. I would recommend this book for anyone who remembers and liked Ken Blanchard's Who Moved my Cheese.
B004W1GCNC|2.0|Sorry but anyone looking for more like Downtown Abbey this falls woefully short in every catagory: Script, production, acting, etc. not even up to par with standard British sitcoms.
1594487154|5.0|I just heard Dan Pink speak about this book at Maryville University in St Louis. The book is insightful and presents a paradigm shift for all who have been in sales sales, as he puts it, to everyone else. Viewing sales as a skill to be gained and appreciated by all is a refreshing message.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|What you get herre is exactly what you weere expecting. Clint Eastwood being himself, the angry old man still shouting at a chair, and a decent performance from Amy Adams doing the best she can with a formula script.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Excellent story, well developed characters, realistic to the point of being quite unnerving.  The subject matter of OCD and panic attacks were written with intelligence and sensitivity.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I started off with the free version but was more than happy to get the full for 2.99. So worth the money. You get alot of game with helpful hints. The story line and graphics are fantastic..... Get this and then upgrade , you will not be sorry. I have even kept it in the cloud to re-play at a later time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is so funny to take pics of your horse but it is challenging. I have had it for a week and i have three horses.
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|I liked it.  I was waiting on how he would grow up as a slave like the original movie.  But this was still a great remake and Rose McGowan makes for a great witch (great casting done for this).
0451196716|5.0|It's a fantastic story! My eyes are basically glued to the book and I received this book in good condition
B00785P2QC|5.0|Highly recommended. Great fun when your bored and want something to do. Challenging but also easy to use. My family loves it
0756655307|5.0|The Marvel and DC Comics encyclopedias are some of the best books any comic book reader could buy just to catch up on the universes or to learn as much as possible about their favorite characters. Sadly this encyclopedias eventually become a bit useless because their info needs to be updated yearly but they are nonetheless fantastic books with great info and artwork.
B0095P29EG|5.0|Follows the comic well. Effect are good. Good story line . It also leaves room for movies in the future.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Wes Anderson collaborates yet again with Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzmann to deliver what is yet another spectacular and original comedy.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This gave me a number of insights into ways to improve our own operations.<br /><br />Plus it was fun to read.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Probably Jim Carrey's best movie. If you love a good romannce with a little surrealistic twist to it then this is the film for you.
B000B8IAFI|1.0|great music BUT poor, poor quality of the vinyl. i am sure i will find a better one in the future
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it so so so much I can play so many different games on just one app it ilia just so amazing
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I liked this book specifically because of the oral history interview format that most of the one-star reviews of the book don't. Brooks obviously heavily researched each character, culture, and country he writes about in the book and the result is a fascinating depiction of how the various peoples and nations of the world might have responded to a zombie apocalypse. Maybe you can disagree with some of his specific predictions and how it ultimately would've turned out, but I found them all very possible and believable. And unlike the vast majority of zombie books out there, I like how Brooks DOESN'T just simply wipe out the human race but shows how the governments of the world are able to narrowly avoid destruction and fight back from the brink of extinction through a massive global war effort--just like they did in WW2. It's a much more intelligent and satisfying in its epic sweeping depiction of a zombie war than the now old and trite \\"confused survivors(s) struggle to survive in post-apocalyptic world\\" zombie books that are a dime a dozen out there.

B004MC0FO8|5.0|This app was recommended to me, because I love music, but I never know who the artist is, or the name of the song.  Now, I can get the name and artist in just a few seconds, so I can purchae and download later!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|As with all translations of great fiction to the screen, some things were changed from the book. Not sure, for example, why they decided to change Theon's sister's name from &#34;Asha&#34; to &#34;Yara&#34;, but it's just a minor distraction. Overall, the acting is superb, the cinematography is outstanding and the story is, as always, compelling! It makes me wish I had HBO so I could watch the next season as soon as it starts insteads of waiting for the next DVD package to arrive!
0425264351|2.0|After seeing the movie starring Tom Cruise I decided to get a copy of the book and read it. When I found out it was written by Lee Child I discovered I had a couple of battered Lee Child paperbacks I had gotten at the thrift store for fifty cents. So I grabbed Killing Floor and started reading.<br /><br />I know it's difficult to write a novel so I try to finish all the ones I start just to see how things are going to finally turn out. This one got so implausible so fast that it was difficult. Child makes the local police (even the good ones) so stupid that they would never have quit trying to pound that square peg into the round hole. Even the retired Boston P.D. investigator lived in Margrave for six months and had no idea that all the businesses in the area were being paid $1000 a week. Reacher found that out soon as he got out of jail from a couple of old black barbers. I guess the black chief investigator never went to get his hair cut from the old black barbers. And, the thousand bucks a week is all counterfiet money! Nobody is the wiser until a banker who got dragged into the counterfieting scheme and is desperate to get out contacts Jacks brother Joe who happens to work for the treasury department. Banks, gas stations, grocery stores are all taking in fake hundred dollar bills for months around the area of Margrave, Georgia and no one suspects a thing! Come on!<br /><br />A secretary of Joes is talked into bringing a briefcase full of his confidential files to Georgia by Jack. She swoons just hearing his voice over the phone and risks her entire livelyhood to help him find Joes killers. Then she gets knifed in the baggage claim area in one of the busiest airports in the world (Atlanta). The crowd was so heavy that she couldn't get out of the flood of people and gets dragged to baggage claim. The crowd was so heavy that Jack and his pals couldn't get to her. Then, after everyone leaves and theres absolutely no one around (that happens every day at the Atlanta airport), Jack finds one of her bloody shoes and deducts that her body must have been dragged through the plastic partition into the back area where the bags are thrown onto the carousel by the airport baggage workers. I guess these guys don't think twice when a bleeding, screaming woman is dragged through the plastic partition. Jack finds her stuffed into a shelving compartment. She's not dead yet and he holds her in his arms while she dies. They just leave her body there and Jack and his cop girlfriend and the chief investigator for the Margrave, P.D. walk out of the Atlanta airport. Jack is covered in blood. No one thinks twice about it and you never hear another word about the body of a woman who works for the U.S. Treasury Dept. being found in the baggage area of the Atlanta airport after her boss was found murdered in a small Georgia town just south of Atlanta. No one puts the pieces of that puzzle together. Come on!!<br /><br />This book was waaaaaaaaaay to full of implausible happenings and coincidences to enjoy reading it. It was like watching Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom.airport), Jack finds one of her bloody shoes and deducts that her body must have been dragged through the plastic partition into the back area where the bags are thrown onto the carousel by the airport baggage workers.

No one puts the pieces of that puzzle together. Come on!!<br /><br />This book was waaaaaaaaaay to full of implausible happenings and coincidences to enjoy reading it. It was like watching Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|The book was great.  Dave turned out to be a good story teller and an awesome person.  Rock on brother!
B004X4R49Y|4.0|Definitely a movie the family can watch and ejnjoy.  We highly recommend The King's Speech for an afternoon of family enjoyment.  John R.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|The penguin finally finds a fish to eat, but apparently an octopus has also found the same fish. The penguin pulls the fish towards him, but the octopus pulls back and soon the two are playing Tug-of-War. Suddenly, a giant octopus appears as everyone watches in awe. The big octopus and his octopi team capture all the penguins, making it YOUR job to save them and WIN THAT FISH BACK!!<br />&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;&bull;<br />CONTROLS - 5* &brvbar; You tilt left and right to collect fish (the currency in the game) and tap to jump. Easy to use and respond almost all the time. Sometimes, though, when an icicle falls or an anchor, the jump doesn't work. I'm not sure if it's just me pressing too lightly, but whatever the problem TAP HARD. Not too hard, but don't tap to lightly or it will cost you.<br />GRAPHICS &amp; MUSIC/SOUNDS - 5* &brvbar; The graphics aren't AMAZING but they are cute and detailed and I don't need to expect any more. Music is good, and the sound effects couldn't be any better.<br />PROS:<br />*Good controls, graphics, sound effects, music<br />*Lots of ways to earn fish without paying real money<br />*Penguins are absolutely ADORABLE!! :)<br />*Very exciting but relaxing at the same time.<br />CONS:<br />*Many of the free ways include joining dating sites, getting a credit card rate, or downloading an app (not all ways, but a lot)<br />*Takes a long time for game to load (a minor problem)<br />*That's it. Can't think of many bad things about this app...<br />OVERALL - Amazing! Five stars! This game is perfect for everyone. My sister loves it, my mom thinks it's &quot;darling,&quot; and my dad has a fun time dodging the sudden anchors. Get it!! It's a must for anyone.<br />.______<br />          <br />                  \  /<br />          ______        \  /<br /> ______    ________   ________   v<br />THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Humerous story line.  Good computer graphics.  A good movie for a family with 4 - 6 year olds.  Even a pre-teen will enjoy it.  John R.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|Maybe I'm just burned out on the Batman franchise (this one, at least), but I didn't like this movie at all.  It ran on way too long and could've used much tighter editing.  (Didn't ANY scenes end up on the cutting-room floor??)<br /><br />I did like the very final scene, which wrapped things up nicely, but maybe that was just the profound relief I felt at being able to finally go on with my life.  (I should've turned it off halfway through, but, darn it, I paid good money for this thing!)
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Having only seen the series in syndication, I really didn't know how good the series would look on Blu-ray, but decided to take a gamble. Well, the gamble paid off... I would have never thought an old television show could look this good... very sharp and clear. A fine addition to my Blu-ray collection.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My husband is of Scottish descent (with a bunch of Viking blended in...ha ha), and apparently has ancestral memories of the glory of this culture many centuries ago, because this is one of his favorite movies!<br />I love it too, not for the rambunctiousness of the male characters, but for the poignant storyline between mother and daughter. Also, the music is amazingly beautiful too, and we bought the soundtrack right away.  This is an excellent 'family' movie, with something for everyone.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended!!!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Beautiful filming, touching story. We watched it twice it was so good. I will have to buy this one! Loved it
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Enjoy the complexity of characters.  The twists in the plots and the continuity and ever expanding life stories also retain my interest.
B0047SF41G|5.0|Nothing beats the original, but this one at least keeps the predators hunting predators theme alive and well.  Far better than other attempts to date.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great book that keeps you thinking a couple steps ahead, really enjoyed it! Lots of story lines, plenty to think about,
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|oh yuss<br />this game is the best of these kind of games and they need to make getting money easyier
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|I love Bonjovi's music!! This was fast and great delivery .Amazon has great choices and great prices. I would buy again from them.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Loved the book. Wish they would have done a better job making the movie after reading this. Greatest love story ever.
1609613937|3.0|This diet we have considered going on but it is really hard to follow. I think we like the idea of this diet more than doing it.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Do not like. Too jumbled. Enjoyed news but now can't obtain info. The other was more &quot;friendly &quot; to use.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Fantastic series. Written and on screen. Can't wait until the new season begins to follow the adventures of the characters.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love these cases. They are stylish and the pink/grey is really cute. Plus they do their job! Get one!!!
B00B23O96A|4.0|After listening to this album several times, I like it more and more with each repeat.  The mixture of blues, country, and reggae with a laid-back approach, is a pleasure, when compared to the unlistenable music coming out today. No note bending<br />, just real singing. Give it a try.
B0028AQLYE|4.0|This works great on the regular centerline swimming snorkel... but it does NOT fit the freestyle snorkel.  That would have been nice to know before buying.  You should def include that bit of info on the sales page.
0807014273|5.0|I first came across this book when I was in high school, just by chance on a library shelf, and reading it changed my life. Since, I have giving copies to a number of friends and family, and have also read it again. It is a story about a life of suffering, and taking control of that suffering by rising above it and giving it meaning. In the first half of Frankl's book he describes the horrific experiences he endured while in concentration camps during WWII. Highlighting the psychological affects the experiences had on prisoners, his indirectly builds the argument that the prisoners who never lost hope and found meaning in their existence although they were existing in such an inhumane way were the ones most likely to survive. For example, he outlines the story of one prisoner who despite their circumstances always had a smile and did his best to keep others spirits up while taking care of them. This prisoner was able to make it through this horrific experience better than the prisoners who succumb to the darkness and despair. It seemed as if keeping one's humanity alive when it had been stripped away by becoming a number was possible by finding meaning in your life. This meaning could be constructed by being altruistic to others, and therefore making your existence purposeful in the circumstances.<br /><br />In the second half of the book, Frankl goes on to extend this theory into modern clinical psychology with his creation of logotherapy. He explains that one of the best way to treat people is to help them discover the meaning in their life and that they have purpose, an approach that previously had not been followed.<br />Overall, I would recommend this book to everyone, even if they are not particularly interested in psychology. It can provide you with a unique view of your life, and help ground and center you in the idea that we are not simply here on this earth to fulfill our biological needs, that there is something more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing, Shocking, Breathe taking Story! This story was sad but worth reading. At first i could not get into the book but half way i could not put it down!!
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|E X C E L L E N T T T T T T T T T T T T T .<br />THANKS.
B00B92ZO3G|1.0|The author says the obvious, but in a way as if he has just discovered the Americas.<br />The book enters in the commonplace of repeating cliche's like: &#34;technology and globalization changed everything....&#34;, thus people now need to sell ideas in order to convince others, everywhere and every time. What's new about that?
075669812X|5.0|Exactly what my grandson wanted; 100% thrilled when received.<br />Package sent with care; no dents or rips; promptly mailed.  A+
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Oh my gosh. This game is a game of all times. It is hard to lay this game down. I love it.
1441737502|5.0|Really like this story.  Good break from the types of books that I usually read.  Overall a good story to listen to and is very entertaining.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I thought this was a very good start. It lead into it from a different point of view than I remember and the added scenes were an unexpected  joy to see. I would recommend  this to all who liked the Lord of the Rings.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|i like the fact that the writer had the courage to share facts about north korea.. and how we all should be happy with what we have....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not what I expected.  This love story transcends age.  Grief, loss, love, unconditional respect this book has so many deep layers and took me by surprise many times.  I love this book!
B00BMVTTJ4|3.0|The movie was good but the speaking did not match the movement of the lips, was like watching an old japenese movie.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|I bought this DVD the first time it came out about 8 years ago.  It was DOUBLE SIDED and would mess up and skip during the last half of the movie.  I took it back to the store THREE times with the SAME problem until finally they just gave me my money back.  Now after all these years I can OWN this movie and it will play right.  They should've fixed this issue 8 years ago.  Glad the newer version exist.  Bonus material is exactly the same as previous release for anybody wondering.
B00BF123WG|3.0|The movie was good but the words don't match the moving lips.  It was like watching an old Godzilla movie.
B00985E3UG|5.0|GREAT BOOK WITH GREAT INFORMATION. ALL YOUNG PARENTS SHOULD READ! THIS BOOK SHOULD WAS NEEDED YEARS AGO. THANKS TO AMAZON FOR HAVING IT AVAILABLE.
B003B17YZE|5.0|Over 25 years ago I put down the sax and clarinet due to this album. I literally went through 3 cassette tapes in 2 years from playing it so much and literally went through 3 CD's over the years.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Loved the story. Loved the choice of actors for each part mainly Alec Baldwin and Hugh Jackman. Would recommend to all ages.
B003BG4KHE|5.0|Beautiful in so many ways. A once-in-a-100 year person who comes along in such a short period of time and gives us a gift that will last hundreds of years.
B0092G1O8A|4.0|We really enjoyed viewing the Hunger Games, we had seen it in the movies so now we realized and caught things we did not see the first time around at the movies.
B006DZYM0A|1.0|A note should be added to the record for this product that it is a Region 2 DVD and will not play in US DVD players.  The Region 1 / US version is here:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Margaret-Theatrical-Extended-Blu-ray-Combo/dp/B005LAIGF0/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1364235520&sr=1-1&keywords=margaret
0061124958|5.0|This book is a must read for all children and parents.  I would recommend this book to schools as required reading.
B001AEF6BI|4.0|This movie is a fabulous film that everyone should see at least once in there life. Keep an open mind!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Skyfall was what Bond needed, just enough over the top action and story to make it a must see. Spying, Girls, action and a story that is awesome!
B00BSBVLF8|2.0|I gave up on it after 30 minutes. The setting was dark during the time I watched, making it difficult to appreciate the mastery of the performers. So, since there was no dialogue, and it was difficult to see the details of the choreography...I gave up. If I can't hear or see what's going on, go read a book, right?
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Clutch rocks!<br />Always has and always will!<br />Clutch does what Clutch does best.<br />They put out great music.<br />Buy it!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was such a quick (almost too quick) and enjoyable read. I recommend this as a light and easy beach read. I haven't seen the movie...will definitely aim to see that.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so addictive!! Trying to get those coins to drop can be a little frustrating because they will linger right on the edge!! It's fun though!
B0060MYM7O|4.0|George R.R Martin, and the producers have talked about it. With any minor change you make to the series you can end changing a lot of the original material.<br /><br />Some changes were needed, the age of the cast for example. Daenerys is a 13 years old in the book series, and a lot of the things that happen on the book cannot be portrayed in the television show if she's of that age. So i'm ok with that change.<br /><br />But there are other things that i don't really like at all. The House of the Undyiing part for example, it's much better the way it happens in the books, i felt really frustrated by the way it ended in the series.<br /><br />The good part of that is that at least the upcome remains almost the same as they happened in the books.<br /><br />What i fear is what will happen in the future.<br /><br />(IF YOU HAVEN'T READ STORM OF SWORDS; DONT READ BELOW)<br /><br />I see the Edric Storm part as one really interesting of the book. How do you balance the life of one person (one innocent) vs the lives of thousands to go on with Melisandre's ritual?. The problem is that in the TV Show they haven't even mentioned Edric Storm, in fact they hardly mention why Davos has to accompany Melisandre to the lower part of the castle, in season 2 when he does the smuggling part, it was to kill the Castellan that didn't wanted to part with Robert's bastard.  Which leaves me to think they won't mention him. And that means that this part of the plot won't even appear in the TV Show.<br /><br />I understand the need to cut some things, but this is too iimportant just to be ignored.<br /><br />This leaves me to think which other parts are they going to just ignore. I hope there aren't too many.<br /><br />Overall i put 4 stars because of this. If they start at least taking into account the Edric Storm plot i would put 5 stars next season.
6302497167|1.0|This review is for the VHS tape.  The product was advertised as Condition \\"New and sealed\\".  It definitely was not new.  The tape they sent was also subtitled in Spanish (which can't be turned off).  The quality of the picture was below average.  I have VHS tapes that were bought new and are fairly old now that look great when I play them so it is not the VHS player.  I don't know which is more distracting, the poor quality of the tape or the Spanish subtitles.  I didn't get what I paid for but I'm not going to return it (only paid $5.99).  I have the Sean Connery 007 Collection Volumes 1 & 2 and just wanted to see this final Bond with Sean Connery.  I'm a bit disappointed that this was advertised as \\"New and sealed\\" when it wasn't.  Even at only $5.99 I would not have bothered with this given the generally poor quality of the tape.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I'm all for a realistic, rosy-glasses-removing look at marriage, but would it kill to depict two people who EVER smile and laugh and enjoy each other's company? &#34;I guess I'm stuck with you forever now&#34; - what a lovely take on commitment!!!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much. It was one of those that you had to keep reading because you didn't know what would happen next. Just when you had decided the outcome of a situation it took a new twist.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was free, which was nice, but I left this story with unanswered questions. The author never went into great detail about these people's lives, such as what they did for a living. How could Megan just pack up her whole life and move to California, but she was still working from Connor's home? Working doing what? The story started a little slow.  There was soooo much dialogue between Megan and Connor, I lost interest until they left her cousin's wedding and finally started their lives together. After that, I couldn't put the book down.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|It's hard not to love this movie if you love Tolkien  I have read some reviews that mentioned it was slow and lacking content. Many others voiced concern that you would be hard pressed to squeeze out a trilogy out of a single book. I enjoyed this movie it was not slow it fleshed out characters that are very interesting and had plenty of action scenes as well. I would say if you liked The Lord of the rings movies you will like this as well. These are all long movies that develop characters more than the average movie of our time so if that appeals to you you will enjoy it.
B001FOPODS|5.0|After seeing this movie at school, my grandson says it was so funny that he wanted this movie at home to watch again and again.  Great condition and price.
B004N7B8DY|5.0|If you like martial arts movies and dont like this one I would be shocked. This is unfortunately the only moderately big budget film we got from Bruce before he passed away. If you want to see a piece of movie history with excellent fighting scenes choreographed by Bruce himself this is the one.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Easiest installation, installed on my kindle fire wireless. I am impressed with the anti virus software, free download, user friendly.
B006QF5CU6|4.0|If your an Arnold fan you won't be disappointed its not real deep but who watches Arnold movies for depth. Decent bad guys with a damsel in distress to boot. Fun flick that won't leave you bored.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Interesting reminder of how the actions of a few change make history. Better than expected. You have to love those glasses from the 70's.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The first time I read the hobbit was in high school so when I watched The Hobbit in the theater I remembered what I read and I enjoyed it. I loved it so much-as well as The Lord of the Ring triligy- I had to buy the video.  Also, I am looking forward to the other ones.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read the book first and then I saw the movie. Both were very entertaining, and I would recommend this book to everyone. It takes you away and makes you wonder how you would survive if this happen to you.  The ending is fantastic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book series I've read in a long time.  I strongly encourage readers to dive into this one.  Seriously, do it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a fun addictive game a good game to pass the time. Never Boring, always fun. I really enjoy this game
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I really loved this cute little movie.  I am an 80s child and still have my Atari 2600, so many of the old games are near and dear to my heart.  I watched this with my son (who is almost 20) and who grew up with Nintendo games as well.  The plot was very well thought out and interesting, and I love how they worked different characters in there.  Qbert was one of my favorite games; I felt very sad seeing Qbert begging for money (spoiler alert) and was very happy for him at the end.  I'm not usually a fan of children's movies, but this one really tugged at my heart strings.  I rented it, and will be buying it to have so I can watch it whenever I want.
0525478817|5.0|The main characters' rhetoric is sure to delight those with an appreciation for rich language. A love story that will warm even the coldest heart.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|One of the most moving things I have ever seen and heard. It stired something deep within, I think, because it ultimately gives God glory for a life lived well.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is O.K. with all the options on the deal.  You can start out on the easy ones and work your way up.<br /><br />Grandma
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very cool, old school game.  Fun and addicting.  Gets pretty challenging on higher levels.  If you like old school gming, this is your game!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love being able to check the weather from my kindle.  It provides quite a bit of detail and I can add multiple sites to watch.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game works very well, has different levels for amateur to expert players.  I normally do not like space raider type games, but I am enjoying this one.  The graphics are enticing, and easy to figure out..
B003XU02QG|5.0|Very good movie but the only thing that might be a problem is the killing, the blood & the gruesomeness of it all, but other from that loved the plot and the story line and the acting wasn't bad at all!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Just what I needed! Durable and light weight. Looks like the pictures and protect my Kindle like I wanted. Great product!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|If I could show 2 thumbs up I would but then again Mel Gibson does good work as well as acting.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Easily available and always ready to go. Wish there was less spam always clogging folders that need to be deleted.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Started slow, but turned into a really great book. One of the best of the WWII stories I have read.  The video of the two old soldiers meeting is wonderful.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I adore being able to see my friends pictures and thoughts as we travel down the road of life. Back in the day, the only option was sending a letter..this is so much better!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Very challenging. Keeps your interest with the different levels of the game. The only problem I have is the inability to save between plays.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game!  I like to play games and really liked Pictionary; however, no one at home likes to play the games with me.  Now I can play on my Kindle Fire with other people that also enjoy playing games.<br />The only suggestion I have is to be able to get different words.  I've been playing it so much that some of the words are repeating now so it would be nice to have more puzzle words!<br />Thanks for this great game!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|A fascinating book, though I wish there was more discussion on personal habits and how to change them.  The story about Angie Bachmann was especially interesting, though gambling has never interested me. Well done and hopefully I will put this book to good use at home and at work.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|We knew the outcome, but the movie had you tense and on the edge of your seat.  Very well done.  Okay, so it was embellished for the big screen.  It was till good to go back and relive what happened and what risks were taken.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|Based on a true story this movie was well done with superb acting by all but especially the three main characters. It was very interesting.  Rec'd quick and in mint condition. Great seller.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Who knew JT had a &#34;soul&#34; album in him!? This album was welcome surprise from the radio driven pop crap he's done in the past.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie which is based on a true story is so sweet, heartwarming and heartwrenching but you are the better for it by watching it. Dogs ARE man's best friend. Rec'd fast, mint condition, packed well, great price.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|This was a wonderfully funny movie.  We totally enjoyed it as a family and got the biggest kick out of Johnny Depp and the entire cast.  Could not have done it any better.
B009PK9SB8|3.0|Nice feature to have.... Burns battery life pretty fast.. Nice to be able to review shots taken.. I would recommend removing  if using video record feature.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to play and pass the time, even though I just started playing I'm don't know how ling I will play before I get bored.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|Received it on time. I like that it is longer than normal so it gives me some moving room when I want to lay down and read instead of having to worry about pulling the charger out of the wall.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|always one of my favorite groups,never had the chance to see them live so listening to them live with such great sound was awsome
B001O1O71C|5.0|it's great and I like the intro to it. Because I have a twenty word cap  here is some weird stuff yolo in a try and I think the giver to bugs.
0547848412|4.0|Book is great. It was required reading for my son in his language arts class. Would recommend for school reading.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Exactly as my title implies,  this is like X Files and so much more. If you enjoy Sci-Fi and JJ Abrams style of writing this is something you dont want to miss.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|We are Jimmy Buffet fans so this fits right into our sailing lifestyle : )<br />blah blah blah blah! hee!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I have not taken the CD out of my car since I bought it...I keep listening over and over and over and just will not get tired. LOVE LOVE LOVE them!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay does not disappoint! Although I really didn't like the ending,it suited the trilogy.<br />Definitely worth the time to read it!
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I have listened to many, many movie scores over the past 25+ years but few have ever touched me like the soundtrack to 'The Last Samurai'.  With a haunting, powerful main theme that catches you and won't let go, Hans Zimmer has taken what he learned while working on the score for 'Black Rain' and produced arguably his greatest work ever.<br /><br />Standout tracks (*****) are:<br /><br />1. A Way of Life<br />6. Idyll's End<br />11. A Small Measure of Peace<br /><br />Other gems (****) are:<br /><br />3. Taken<br />4. A Hard Teacher<br />7. Safe Passage<br /><br />Out of 11 tracks that is more than HALF that I give 4 stars or more, an unprecedented piece of work where I can rarely recall many other scores having that kind of impact on me.  The other 5 tracks are wonderful as well, nothing on this album is lacking in quality.<br /><br />This score is an absolute masterpiece.  It touches me like few others ever have and it is perfect for meditation or just seeing the beauty in life.<br /><br />If I was trapped on a desert island and had 10 pieces of music I could bring, this makes that very short list.<br /><br />******* PERFECTION
B00171E8CW|5.0|A gathering of top artists performing legendary songs.........WOW ! &#34;One of the greats&#34; receives the honor we all feel he so richly deserves.
B008IBP24C|5.0|Well written.  Just enough drama.  Showing humans in many lights, but not too harsh.  Inspiring to hear them speak in such an eloquent way.  What has happened to our language?
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This was on par with &#34;made for TV&#34; movies, not what I expected from Denzel. The trailer looked good, but.....
B009KEN87O|5.0|I wish there were more games like this. Great to spend a few minutes on, creative, and just plain old fun.<br />I hope there are new levels coming. Got it free as a daily deal, but would be glad to spend a buck or two to keep development happening.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A good effort from Clancy but not his best. Very entertaining and as usual the subject matter was very relevant and timely. The only issue is that it was a bit predictable; not formulaic necessarily but some of the sub plots were a bit obvious. If you are a Clancy fan it's worth your time and money...
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I don't have much to add. The gameplay is pretty immersive and occasionally spooky. Slender man is pretty nasty.<br />I take one star off only because I got bored wandering around the field just dodging him.<br />But kudos for a game that is a little different and affecting.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I purchased this album after the Rap Critic from TGWTG.com did a review of Thrift Shop and said Thrift Shop wasn't even the best song on the album. After giving it a listen, I'm inclined to agree with his assessment. The beats are dope, the lyrics charged and full of personality and relatable. Macklemore flows quite well throughout, the subjects covered in the songs are varied and interesting. I'd have to say my favorite track is Wing$ for the message and the personal feel of the message conveyed. Overall, definitely worth purchasing the whole album instead of just Thrift Shop if you like music that makes you think and feel.
B00846WWVM|3.0|Appreciate this as a free game last week, and really wanted to like it. The water physics is neat and all. But the game mechanics were painful (on Nexus 7). Trying to lower the tower and rotate it just didn't work well for me, and was uncomfortable to boot. In the space of a 7-inch tablet I couldn't consistently find a way to get my fingers right to rotate the nozzle which was just darn frustrating. If I had 3 hands that would work.<br /><br />Ended up just giving up.<br /><br />Kids didn't have any more luck than I did.
0812973992|5.0|I loved this book.  It is wonderfully written, all about love of each other, love of places and love of the world.  I have shared with several friends who also loved this book.  As the critic of the NYTimes, wrote..&#34;it is a profound story.&#34;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was afraid of this one at first, but once I started reading the characters came to life for me. I wish it had not ended so soon. I'm reading 1st shift now, it is a little different than the first 5, but aren't all prequels that way.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This is a great movie. I'm so glad to see Robert Downey Jr get his act together. He really does a great job in this movie.
B00012QM86|5.0|Timeless classic. Everyone should see this at least once to remember how far we have come and not slip back into old hateful ways.
0345803485|5.0|I'm not much of an avid reader... been a while since I've read through a whole book. this one was well worth it! the story line is very good and I found myself not wanting to put the book down. So clearly, I had to order the next two books in the trilogy. I'm on the third book now, and still loving it. Not disappointed at all.<br />Only comment I will make, is the writing sometimes veered to where the characters and everything was set in what seemed to be a very proper British tone. I kept catching British verbiage & mannerisms throughout the book, so when the plot was set in the United States, some of the writing did not match the image the author was attempting to portray.<br />I also found the constant 'Inner Goddess' popping in every time Ana has a thought, annoying, along with a few other repetitive things here and there. For example: after reading how sexy Christian looks in a certain outfit- a description of that is not needed throughout the entire novel each time she looks at him wearing that certain outfit. And at the rate Ana seems to bite her lip- one would assume she'd have horribly chapped/raw lips when almost literally you can't get through a couple pages without a reference to her once again biting her lip. No wonder Christian was annoyed by it... having to read that too many times became annoying.<br />Otherwise, the book(s) are great! If you can handle a bit of a suspense, romance & erotic plot- it's a great read. If you don't want to read a book with descriptive erotic scenes and intense sexual fantasy play... this is definitely not for you. Might as well get the whole trilogy, as I wish I would have. I ended up coming back here to order the next two only half-way through the first book. :)
B004H4XLRE|5.0|My 3 year old son and all of his friends love this toy!  He plays with t all of the time.  Most regular cars fit in the slots.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story line, great cast, great HD picture. Can't wait till Season 3 is aired on the Amazon Kindle Fire.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I still haven't figured out how to use it on my Kindle Fire or my computer.  Everyone that I have talked to says it is hard to get started with it.  As soon as I can figure out how to delete it I am going to.<br />It is worthless
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.  It is really challenging and fun to play.  The screens get harder as you finish one and go to the next, but it keeps your brain working.
B000ID37RM|5.0|I had never read this book nor seen the movie so I watched it this weekend and it was excellent.  The author of the book is from Alabama, which is my home state so that was another reason I wanted to see it.  Gregory Peck was excellent and the young girl who played Scout was terrific.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It makes it really fast and easy to get to facebook without a whole lot of waiting and searching...and it's free.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a fun little matching game- I like the way you can swipe the screen to turn the cube to get new matches- the only thing I think this game needs is another way to view your previous scores other than previous 'tweets'. Great way to exercise your brain!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I enjoyed this game. It had an interesting story and was funto follow. This is the type of games I like. They make time go by soo fast.
1250027624|5.0|Wonderful book on the characters and actors of the show, but especially I enjoyed the English History lesson that was interlaced with the story.
B00BRR66SA|3.0|I'll keep this simple.  For an album that took 5 years coming, it doesn't really move forward; everything sounds like a b side to FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS, with some dashes of Bruno Mars doo-wop styling.  And every song is unnecessarily padded to 6-8 minutes.  What does that add, really?  It's not like it's a concept album that tells a story, or links harmonically; it's insipid and needs editing.  I hope that hindsight is 20/20 and when the second set is released that it is much better than this one turned out.  It's not terrible, hence three start, just disappointing.
0345803507|1.0|I feel sorry for the men that read this and expect women to enjoy being hurt.  I feel sorry for the women who think that they have to receive this abuse from a man.  Love should not include punishment sex.  Isn't that what rape is?
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an excellent version.<br />I recommend it for anyone who likes solitaire. It has good options for playing alone, with a partner or even a winning hand that you have to figure out.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love itjust wish u didn't have to tap so much to upgrade but other than that love it I like that you can keep adding shops and game keeps going were it doesn't end as soon as u play and u don't need no friends on it like everything else
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but didn't think it was best picture caliber, although I am happy to see it won especially when snubbed for best director.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game had an incredible amount of work put into it. You can follow or skip the story line - I like that. there are several incredibly difficult levels, but then you get easy ones too. I like that it doesn't just get harder and harder to impossible. I almost couldn't conquer day 78, Spoiler Alert: Get those fireballs blasting!<br />Great work - thank for a solid game!
B001JU4S44|3.0|Good action, but unbelievable with the constant face masks.  Thandie Newton is the only reason to watch this one. 20.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Do you ever experience that moment when after an hour or so of waiting for the vilian and plot to enfold that you realize there is a couple of poorly thought out twists in the movie script that you cannot ignore for the rest of the movie?  Unfortunately... as a huge Bond fan I ran into that feeling at least a couple of times.<br /><br />What was wrong?  You will see... two moments when Bond proves to be not that clever after all... and leaves you wondering why someone in MI6 would ever not take advantage of an easy target.  It almost reminded me of that movie Gold Member when the Dr Evils son is telling his dad, &#34;why not just let me shoot him...&#34; and &#34;Dr Evil&#34; then goes into a diatribe on why he can't (secret agent movie protocols).  Sorry but I have to be honest.  But if you ignore it all its still an okay Bond movie.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Very easy to use and I love the ability to color code my appointments on the calendar and my notes.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Nice to see Peter Pan again, very good remastering and it's one of the few movies out there that we can still watch with all the family (1-yr up) without worries.  Good price, good delivery turnaround, we have enjoyed our purchase.  Thanks!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Excellent movie! Enjoyed the view. Not completely true to the history of the story, however, great dramatization with many historical facts preserved.
B007IK44CK|4.0|I could only stream this movie in standard definition.  It ran fine, no stopping due to internet connection speed.  I am running a 1 mbs dsl connection.
B0039RY3MM|5.0|Purchase this because I have seen very good results from others. It was deliverd in very good time and received in excellent condition.It is easy to use and apply. I am getting good temps with it and will probably use it again.
B008JLEUD0|5.0|Lively, wonderful music, every song different and refreshing. Fatoumata is so talented and this record reflects her passion. Recording quality is superb. Highly recommended.
B002X9W50E|5.0|This recording of David Bowie's Reality tour is one of the best ever.  The sound is awsome and clear and the songs are fantastic.  Under Pressure is AMAZING.
B00006LJ72|5.0|Loved this collection and the descriptions she added to it.  Very beautiful and relaxing songs.  Would recommended this collection to anyone.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|While not as groundbreaking as FutureSex/LoveSounds, this is an excellent follow-up. Smooth, sexy and groovy, JT finds the sweet spot to mix pop, neo-soul, dance and funk into one scrumptious package. While critics have likened the lyrics to p*rn, we have all heard worse things on radio.The song, Mirrors, and its accompanying video, certainly makes a certain Biel the luckiest woman in the world. For the rest of us, we find salvation in JT's music. A welcome return.
B004K00NMG|1.0|As we all know the movie is amazing and astonishing, but the bluray box offers the option of listening the movie in three different languages (English, Spanish, French)and subtitles (also in those three languages) but when the disk plays any of those options does not exist. the movie only plays in English and no option of any subtitles. very disappointed with the disk, even the box came broken.
0790729644|1.0|I watch westerns for one reason, to see the good guys beat the bad guys. But there are no good guys here, just bad guys and worse guys. And so, none of the emotions that I'd typically feel while watching a western were invoked, because I simply didn't care about any of the characters.
B00845PT18|4.0|Was good, but not quite like the first one.  I like a lot of Nicolas Cages movies like this type.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Great movie, just a little too long.  Shorten the torture scenes and it would be about right.  It was good.
B00000K2W1|5.0|I bought this CD as a gift for my wife.She was very happy with my selection.This CD gets played extremely often.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book. Another Flynn thriller!!  It was difficult to put down. I can't wait for the next Mitch Rapp thriller!!
B00683JK9K|4.0|The puzzles are easy and I find they help time go by when I am waiting for an appointment.  They are fun and simple.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I really enjoy the series and how it has evolved !!!! Would recomend it to anyone that likes science fiction !!!
B008D36INE|2.0|I understand that this is a drama/romance genre, but the overplaying of the violin? Really?! Its ridiculous!!! It seemed like every scene in the movie there was a violin playing! It was really annoying to listen too.  Moving on to the movie itself, the first part of the movie starts off very slow, with flashbacks from the past and the present, it then continues to be super slow throughout the movie. I hated the storyline- this woman doesn't seem to know what exactly she wants from both men. She seems very unhappy with herself.....all in all this movie sucked, it was depressing and faintly dark....
B00B935SUY|5.0|Very thorough documentary of times gone by in the music industry.  Very informative and at time poignant.  I really enjoyed it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you have somehow managed to miss Downtown Abbey, here is your chance to get caught up.  Downtown Abbey is the greatest series to come out of England, ever.  Great story line, great costumes, great characters, and great setting.  The story line follows the upstairs aristocrats, and the downstairs people who serve them.  They are equally interesting, tragic, heartbreaking, and amusing.  Once you get a taste, you will want more.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great story! Really enjoyed reading it. Going to look up where to find the next book once I finish this review.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|The extended edition is really fabulous.  Love the new footage.  Highly recommend this package.  You won't be sorry,<br />Twihards.  Buy it!
B009A87X80|5.0|Eva Cassidy's voice is remarkable. Listening to her is like relaxing at a fine spa.  I have purchased several cds for myself and friends.
