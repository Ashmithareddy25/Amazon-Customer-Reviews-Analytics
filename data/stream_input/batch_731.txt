B000UX6THK|5.0|Here is the best possible Christmas gift for the David Lynch fan on your list (and really, whose list doesn't include at least one David Lynch fan?) After years of begging and groveling - and trying to find pirated Region 1 copies somewhere on the web - \\"Twin Peaks\\" devotees finally get the box set they deserve. Pop in the pilot episode disc and it all comes flooding back: Angelo Badalamenti's swooning, lugubrious music; the lovely burnished cinematography; the remarkable list of actors who make up one of the largest and most talented casts ever assembled for a TV series; and best of all, the utterly unique, dreamlike vision of David Lynch, whose strange sensibility informs nearly every moment of the show.    \\"Twin Peaks\\" was - as nearly every reviewer here has stated - one of the most compelling and original series ever to make it on to network TV. It paved the way for darkly offbeat series like \\"The X Files\\" and \\"Six Feet Under,\\" and even lighter fare like this year's \\"Pushing Daisies.\\" It's been copied but never equaled, and watching it again it's amazing to rediscover how far ahead of its time \\"Twin Peaks\\" was. If this show aired on TV tomorrow it would still appear utterly contemporary.    That's in large part due to the timeless themes and setting of the show. Lynch is a genius at evoking two of the strongest human emotions: love and fear - and \\"Twin Peaks\\" taps into those emotions from its opening moments. The dark passions that surround the back story of the doomed Laura Palmer are intertwined with moments of pure supernatural terror in scenes that still retain their power to shock.    Anyone who watched the show during its original run grew to know and love these oddball characters and the actors who portrayed them - from Michael Ontkean's steadfast Sheriff Truman to Peggy Lipton's luminous Norma to Kyle MacLachlan's Lynch stand-in Agent Dale Cooper (\\"Diane, I've got to find out what kind of trees these are...\\") Perhaps the biggest surprise is seeing againhow wonderful the young actors are, particularly the actresses Lara Flynn Boyle, Madchen Amick, Sheryl Lee and Sherilyn Fenn. These gorgeous women make you totally believe they could cast a spell on the young men of Twin Peaks and drive them into fits of romantic obsession. They're amazing.    But so are the veteran stars in the cast, from Piper Laurie to Joan Chen to Ray Wise to the invaluable Grace Zabriskie. Thanks to Lynch, his partner Mark Frost and a talented group of writers, every actor in the cast is able to create a richly realized, complete character.    But in the end what makes \\"Twin Peaks\\" so special is the way that Lynch casts a shadow of supernatural dread and terror over what could have been a routine murder mystery or a jokey teen soap opera. The surrealistic touches he added to the show help elevate it above almost anything else that's been on prime time either before or since.     The only thing that could have made this box set more perfect is if it came wrapped in plastic.

I finished the book in just 2 days cause it doesn't allow you to drop it down. and most importantly, after you finished it, the impression that story left on you doesn't go away that easily. On the contrary, it makes you think about it more and more in days to come.     Khalid Hoessini must continue writing books. such kind of unique talent doesn't come to the world everyday.
B0006HB84Y|4.0|Much more than You Raise Me Up, His killer single. 4 stars., November 11, 2007<br />By  Adrian Cooper \\"Spreading love and education.\\" (Dunkirk, NY USA) - See all my reviews<br />(REAL NAME)<br /><br />I don't think there are many more relaxing, and soothing CDs, that truly inspire and uplift the soul. He's not bad looking, but His voice is where it's at. It's never flat, it's always uplifting, and somewhat melancholy. Somewhat powerful. Not as powerful as Clay Aiken's, but He's much easier on the eyes than Clay.<br /><br />And let's be honest, has Clay put out a listen-able CD, EVER???! I rest my freakin' case. This CD is so good, that I even enjoyed the Spanish songs for the most part. And I'm not a fan of music that I don't understand much...!<br /><br />Hymne A L'Amour is very a very sexy track. LOL Can't believe I just said that. =P<br /><br />Anyway, it's rather enjoyable throughout. I only could imagine skipping one track.<br /><br />Cover Art: B+<br />Songwriting: B<br />Vocals: B<br />Production: C+<br />Length: A+<br />Overall: B<br /><br />4 stars.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|I really enjoyed this album, It's the perfect music for decorating the tree and wrapping gifts. I think it's perfectly mellow for the calmer moments of the holiday season.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I purchased the album the first week of release.  I have since lost place of the both records and the cover but I still have the song book.  I now listen to the CDs and read/sing along at least once every saturday if I'm not mowing the grass or grilling etc.  I can't get enough of this album, great stuff.
1400064627|2.0|I saw the movie when I was very young (9 or 10) and remember loving it. I have not seen it since then and did not even know it was based on a book until recently, at which time I picked the book up at my local library and read it.<br /><br />I was, well, a little disappointed.<br /><br />I think maybe I need to see the movie again to see if I even like it now, as an adult, as much as I liked it as a child, but as for the book...it was just way too all over the place and simplistic for my taste. The timeline jumped around so much that half the time I wasn't even sure what decade the chapter I was reading was taking place in, and I didn't feel as if I got to truly KNOW any of the characters because of this.<br /><br />I think that the book has some good messages, but all in all it just wasn't what I expected from what I remember feeling for the movie.

B000001FE0|5.0|This was the first studio album I ever purchased by the Bee Gees. I bought it upon release & have yet to tire of it. It's the best thing they ever did. There were some creative differences, primarily, between Barry & Robin over the direction of this album. This led to a breakup of two years, hence, the title of their next album. Make no mistake, this is one of their best albums; it just barely misses being essential. It's the three orchestrated instrumentals that causes this; they are actually pretty good but the term \\"filler\\" jumps out at me. This is their fourth studio album & is quite different from anything they put out at the time. If it weren't for the very distinctive voices of Barry & Robin you probably wouldn't realize that this is the Bee Gees. A very solid piece of creativity.     Odessa peaked at #20 on the album charts, this was the worst result for a Bee Gees album to this point. Only one single charted from the album, \\"First of May\\", it only went to #37.    The album opens with the title song \\"Odessa (City on the Black Sea)\\". This starts with a psychedelic style then gets into the song proper. This is one of their most creative songs, one of the highlights of the album. \\"You'll Never See My Face Again\\" follows & is a good song. Then comes \\"Black Diamond\\" which is also a very good song. Then comes the country music sounding \\"Marley Purt Drive\\". The lyrics tell of an orphanage owned by the writer, some of the most humorous ever done by the Bee Gees & is one of my favorite songs on the album. Then comes \\"Edison\\", a lyrical tribute to Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor. This song is a serious misstep, one of the worst songs on the album. \\"Melody Fair\\" is only an average song, it's an improvement from the previous song, but it's typical Bee Gees pop. \\"Suddenly\\" is a rare lead vocal by Maurice & is one of the better songs on the album. \\"Whisper Whisper\\" is a weak song, the vocals can get on your nerves. The only thing that elevates the song is the faster section at the end. \\"Lamplight\\" has a great melody & could've been a hit. \\"Sound of Love\\" is another good song that Barry's vocal shine. \\"Give Your Best\\" is another country-sounding song but is a weak song. \\"Seven Seas Symphony\\" is the first of three instrumentals on the album. It's performed by a complete orchestra &, as far as I can tell, there aren't any of the brothers performing on it nor on the other two instrumentals. \\"With All Nations (International Anthem)\\" is also an orchestra only instrumental. \\"I Laugh in Your Face\\" is a highlight of the album with lyrics that don't make complete sense. \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is typical Bee Gees pop with a catch melody, this one also could've been released as a single. \\"First of May\\" is one of the Bee Gees best songs that has melancholy lyrics, one of the best songs they ever did & should've charted higher than it did. The album closes with the third orchestral instrumental \\"The British Opera\\" &, like the previous two instrumentals, it's okay but nothing spectacular.    Overall, Odessa is a very enjoyable album, the Bee Gees did some daring songs here that deserve more acclaim & recognition. If you want to hear different facets of the Bee Gees this is the album to start with.
B0002YLC24|5.0|\\"I believe if there's any kind of God it wouldn't be in any of us, not you or me but just this little space in between\\", well maybe some of you already have heard that (is a quote in Before Sunrise), well I think that is that quote is true, this movie is the closest I ever saw to get, to describe, that space that exist between two people. Very recommended!!
0143038419|2.0|The first third of this book was painful, but I stuck it out due to my friend's strong recommendation. The incessant whining and droning on about her life was compounded by paragraph-long analogies that were recycled from a few Sex in the City episodes. (And yes, I find it ironic that I am complaining about Gilbert's complaining) The writing was self-absorbed and downright egotistical at times, which is quite a juxtaposition to her spiritual quest of egolessness. But in order to see the light, you have to go through the darkness. And maybe this was Gilbert's intention when writing this book. But regardless, I found it neither well written nor enlightening.
0143038583|4.0|It's an interesting book which comprises several aspects from economy, agriculture, diet, and health.<br />After reading this, you will realize that we are merely walking proteins and vitamins! :P
0143038419|1.0|SO many people said I HAD to read this book. So I took it out from the Library and returned it 4 days later. I couldn't even finish the book which is rare for me. This book is so poorly written and so self absorbed. Eat, Pray and love, sure, but don't waste time or money reading this book.
B00005JPS9|3.0|I went to see a 3D Imax and was glad that this movie was only 113 mins. The CGI makes it difficult to my eyes a comfort level to enjoy the film.<br />To make a 3D movie, it's inevitable that the characters look gaming; only I wish I had a controller in hand.<br />Beowulf is a hero and also like one of us who have desires and emotions. His human nature almost fell the same destiny as the prior king, but he chose a different path.<br />A hero also bears great responsibility to both oneself, as well as to others. Such quality also reflects to us who are same as Beowulf that we live our own life and legend, being responsible gives you a sense of stability and security, and it fulfills you from inside since you realize that you're someone others can count on.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|This CD is entertaining for club music.  The music is catchy even with Britney's modified voice in most of the songs.  None the less, it's a good deal I got on Amazon as a gift for a friend in addition to a lot other music CD's.  I recommend if you like clubbing and clubbing music this is a good CD to tune up and dance to.
0066620996|3.0|I was assigned to read this book for a Leadership class I am taking for work.  I was not looking forward to reading this book, however, when I read the first few chapters I was really excited, it was turning out to be a very interesting book.  I enjoy books where you can learn, not by reading terms, definitions and boring data, but by reading about real life examples of the terms, definitions and data.  There was a lot of information about companies like Gillette, Kimberly Clark, Circuit City, Nukor, Fannie Mae and Kruger (to name a few).  These are companies that Collins's team ear marked as \\"Good to Great\\" companies.  The book was a lesson on how these companies became \\"Good to Great\\".  Part of the research was a comparison of these \\"Good to Great\\" companies to other companies that had several similar characteristics but were not as successful like Bank of America, Chrysler, A&P and RJ Reynolds.  The excitement of this book wore off, however, in the middle when it started to get a bit redundant and wordy.  I actually couldn't wait to finish it and read something I want to, not have to.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|If anyone ever told me I would be listening hard rock and metal, I would just laugh at them. And here I am, addictevly listeng to this TDG CD in my car, blasting up sound. This people actually can sing, lyrics are interesting, deep and meaninful, and the energy of music is just giving me orgasmlike goosebups! There is no bad songs on CD!! ONE-X changed my opinion on this type of music to the point of even buying CD. People who know me, would understand, it's a big deal! You must have it!!

B000WCBPOG|5.0|LOVE this CD.  We also purchased the \\"regular\\" version right after we saw the movie for the first time, and I recommend this one instead.  It has  more of the songs from the movie, even though it doesn't have one of my favorites -- I Want You (She's So Heavy).  My kids and I have listened to this CD probably 30 or 40 times in the first month we've owned it.  Highly recommend it.

0767812387|5.0|This dance movie is a classic, I never tire of watching it. Cheyenne is delicious and Vanessa Williams is excellent in this movie! You will not be disappointed in this one, I also have the soundtrack that I listen to every weekend!
B000WTLDPU|5.0|I saw this film in the theater with my wife, brother, his wife and their two kids--a girl 16 and a boy 13.  To a person, we all loved it.  It is clever, funny and a visual treat.  It does not take its self too seriously and thus drew comparisons with us to \\"Princess Bride\\"--which is a favorite of mine.  This movie some how slipped beneath the radar in the theaters even though I recommended it to everyone who would listen and never found anyone who saw it who did not like it.  Check it out if you want a fun escape.  Robert Deniro is hilarious.
B000H305U0|5.0|This is my only CD from Justin Timberlake but I think it is the best!!!
B00000JMQE|3.0|When one blows off the sugar-coating of the Oz stories - and in comparison to the classic music with Judy Garland - you have a sometimes scary story with some strange ideas.  While this is fun, it's also extremely absurd and it is readily apparent that Frank L. Baum was one strange guy - an author who's ideas walked a barely cohesive tightrope and we designed to be anything but bedtime stories. Still...an interesting story and presentation, but not for smaller children.
0465068359|4.0|This is the first book I've read on Japanese aggression in Nanking, and as far as that goes, it's a very good, easy read, and gives a good overview of a depressing point in history. It is very eye-opening in some unexpected ways, such as having a Nazi being really one of the \\"good guys\\", and on the other hand the continued evasion of Japan in facing their responsibilities.<br /><br />I think it's worth reading, and hesitate to try and describe any faults. There are areas I'd like more detail on, but OTOH, if the book became too mired in detail, it might become unreadable. I would appreciate more photos, but OTOH, too many more could be construed as grisly for grisly's sake. Overall, it's a good mix and a good book. I feel better educated than before I read it.
0743464117|5.0|A well-written, gripping story of the Screaming Eagles, E Co, 506th regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagles Nest. Stephen E. Ambrose writes with so much respect and admiration for this Band of Brothers and I was enthralled by the men of Easy Co and their story. America's greatness and spirit can be found through the actions of these men and what they did for their country. We were blessed to have them in WWII and their story is the stuff of legends.

0061124265|5.0|I truly enjoy reading Paulo Coelho's  books. I've read almost all of them and love reading them over again. this book, like all his other books, makes me think and ponder about myself, my life and my own dreams. I love his books because I always find myself in his characters. This book made me think of importance of living in the present and cherish every moment we have. If you are into philosophy of life and like to ponder and think about what its meaning , I think you shoud give his books a try.

B000UJ48WC|5.0|For being 27 years old, this movie has never captivated me more. Letterbox has opened this up to a whole new level, and the detailed picture and sound only enhance one movie that was truly made for blu ray; I have seen this dozens of times, but this was like a religious experience in many ways; I heard and saw things I never had before; This was my first blu ray, so I can't imagine how something more recent looks!! It was almost like certain sequences were in 3D; The ballroom and hedge maze sequences were just jaw dropping, and Kubrick's bizarre color schemes suit the incredible picture quality perfectly. The eerie music sounds even more menacing!!! Great extras, too!!! Finally somebody gave this movie the treatment it always deserved!!

1932073221|5.0|This is the same book as Creating Money: Keys to Abundance.  I mistakenly ordered it thinking it was a new book because the title had changed and it ( Attracting abundance) was being offered with Keys to abundance. In fact it is simply a republication of the original. I own the original and it is a great book.
0375842381|5.0|This is by far the most engaging, intelligently-wrtten works of children's literature I have ever read. (And for anyone getting hyped up about the religious factor, please read this before you judge!) The prose is sophisticated (I would say this is for kids with a very good vocabulary, maybe a 9+), and the characters are engaging. And talk about action packed! Pullman always keeps the reader guessing, and the action always is intriguing. The books do have violence in them (nothing too gory, but there are some battle scenes with blood, and some characters die), so keep that in mind if you want to read it to kids younger than 9.<br /><br />A lot of people say this book is anti-religious, anti-God, atheistic, etc. Most of these reviews have obviously not read the series. I actually found The Golden Compass in the book closet of the Catholic school where I taught English Lit! This book for certain is NOT anti-Christian. It does not preach evil values, & it does not encourage children to kill God. The book has a lot of religious aspects: souls, angels, and spirits. This book IS anti-religious corruption, and it IS against using religion to justify evil. One review mentioned the book encourages female circumcision: so wrong!...what the book said was that religions have used faith in God to cause harm to many, including the cutting of genitalia! And if Pullman is an atheist, so what? C.S. Lewis was a Christian. Does that mean Jews, Muslims and Buddhists can't enjoy the Narnia series, even though its messages aren't parallell to their own religious values?<br /><br />One thing that I do like is that Pullman creates very strong-minded children for his main characters, especially Lyra. Despite having horrible parents, Lyra finds strength within to overcome seemingly impossible tasks with the aid of her daemon Pan. I like that Pullman talks a lot about how fear can destroy people and societies, and also on a subtle level, how technology gone too far can wreak havoc on the world. I also like that Lyra both respects and questions authority. She has a mind and a sense of adventure, and I love that she breaks so many female sterotypes.<br /><br />I'm re-reading the series now and am giving it to my 10 year-old cousin for Christmas. I know he'll love it as much as I do!that Lyra both respects and questions authority. She has a mind and a sense of adventure, and I love that she breaks so many female sterotypes.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|I bought the soundtrack of Across the Universe right after I saw the movie so that I could relive the phenomenal big-screen images. But what I found was how well the sound track holds up on its own. The actors have beautiful voices and the interpretations of old classics are fresh and energetic. This is my favorite interpretation of Beatles songs. Great for getting me out of a bad mood!

0671015206|2.0|Books about personal finance are 90% the same message: stay out of consumer debt, budget, live well under your means, don't spend frivolously, buy used cars instead of leasing new ones, invest 10-20% of your pay, and max out your retirement savings to lower your current tax bracket as well as plan for the future. They all say this. Each book might introduce 10% new material, and they each have their own spin on how you should do these things, and in which order. For instance, there's a huge divide between these authors as to whether it's more important to pay off your consumer debt, or start your savings.<br /><br />This book, however, got really repetitive really fast. I was reminded of Jack Nicholson in \\"The Shining\\" typing \\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\\" for page after page. This book could have done the same thing by printing the same message:<br /><br />It's easy to become a millionaire when you never spend any money.<br />It's easy to become a millionaire when you never spend any money.<br />It's easy to become a millionaire when you never spend any money.<br /><br />Right. I got that.<br /><br />The authors display their extreme bias against paying any form of taxes with lots of tongue-in-cheek cutsie stories. While they provide some good food for thought about how you can legally lower your tax rate, they take it farther than I preferred. Apparently things like public schools, paved roads, police, and fire departments aren't good uses of any of their money! I could have done with less preaching on the taxes.<br /><br />Later, they get silly with this frugality thing. One chapter praises a particular millionaire whose family has lived in the same 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom house for 40 years -- and I can just imagine the clutter and problems with that house and its one bathroom! The same millionaire drives old American cars because he goes fishing on the weekends and he likes to throw the raw, unwrapped, dead fish straight into the backseat.<br /><br />Dude, are you kidding me?<br /><br />Nope. This guy is the hero of the book - they saved the best for last!<br /><br />So this is the Millionaire Next Door I'm supposed to emulate? The guy whose family has lived with 1 bathroom for 40 years, and whose car stinks to high heaven of dead fish?!<br /><br />The book was interesting to get the mental wheels turning, but it definitely goes from the ridiculous to the sublime very soon. My advice is to check this book out from your local library. It does have something interesting to offer, but it's unlikely to be one you'll want to reference year after year.o of the book - they saved the best for last!

B0000C3I6U|5.0|this is one of the greatest movies of all time.    you MUST have it.
0446677450|5.0|The best feature of this book is that it encourages the reader to \\"think outside the box\\" about money. For example, the author discourages you from using the phrase \\"I can't afford it.\\" He suggests that when you say that, your brain shuts down, stops working on the problem. Train yourself to ask instead, \\"How can I afford it?\\" It's an easy difference, but one that reflects much his philosophy. Further, is working full-time and relying on paychecks the best method to earn the financial security you desire? Maybe, maybe not, but the most valuable lesson is the question itself, and learning to look at things in a new way.<br /><br />The author's failing is providing specific suggestions in the \\"how to\\" category. He's not very good at it. This book is more to start the wheels turning. He provides a great reference and reading list in the back for further reading if you want more specific instruction.<br /><br />It's an easy read, and a short read. It's worth the time.
0143038419|1.0|This book was a Mother's Day gift having been highly recommended to my husband from a bookseller.  I kept wishing it would get better.... I would appreciate the author's style and her story as the pages went on and on and on ad nauseum.  After getting through about 2/3 of it I quit.  The author's personality was not one which I could either admire, her actions not those I would like to emulate.  This was one of the \\"best sellers\\" that had me completely mystified.   Hard to believe it's been on any charts - it certainly is NOT any book I would recommend anyone waste their time reading.

My favorite tracks are Battery and of course the title track. Guess what, the louder you play it the better it sounds, although your neighbors might not think so. Hail Metallica!<br />[...]

I recommend for everyone to read this book. It will change your life too!
B0006L16N8|5.0|This was my first Coldplay album it is great.  I highly recommend this album.  It still can't compete with Parachutes because of Yellow.    I would say get all three albums they all get five stars from me.    Peace
B000N6U0E2|3.0|Yes, Will Smith is a wonderful actor (though this isn't his best performance ever).  Yes, it's a true rags to riches story which is heartwarming. Yes, for the first 1/2 of the movie everything that can go wrong, does go wrong (with a few of those unbelievable \\"magical moments of turning a story based on truth into a movie\\" type coincidences.)<br /><br />However, there's no suspense whatsoever - and that's about the time you realize a nap is a better option.  We know he'll make it in the end.  We know the lesson is resiliency and persistency in the face of all odds.  (We also know his real son isn't much of an actor).  In any case, after realizing that there were going to be endless moments of showing them sinking lower and lower while playing long, draggy music my boyfriend and I fell asleep for the second half. When we woke up - we played the second half (but just fast-forward until there was some action).  There were 2 minutes at the very end that it gets resolved (one of those spent with big hugs, and more long draggy muusic) and then a blurb about what happened in the real person's life.  (Quite frankly - that would have made a better second half for the movie).
080701429X|5.0|This is an incredible account of a man who lived through the Holocaust, and had the ability to seperate himself from the brutality of the circumstances to provide a dispassionate view of himself, and what he went through. It is just an incredible piece of literature!
B000001ELF|5.0|OKAY I AGREE WITH ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS<br />SO I'D LIKE TO SAY GO AHEAD AND TRY<br />THE REST OF THE SOLO ALBUMS. WHILE<br />PAUL STANLEY'S IS THE 2ND KISS SOUNDING<br />LP AND QUITE GOOD, PETER CRISS'S IS ALSO<br />GOOD BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT WITH SLOW AND<br />ROCKING SONGS AND GENE SIMMONS IS ALSO<br />DIFFERENT WITH GREAT SLOW AND ROCKING<br />SONGS BUT KISS FANS JUST DON'T SEEM TO<br />WANT TO GIVE THEM THEIR DUE. IF THESE<br />HAD BEEN RELEASED WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE<br />WHO MADE THEM THEY WOULD'VE BEEN MASSIVE<br />HITS BUT...IT WAS KISS SO......CRITICS<br />PANNED THEM AND SOME FANS ALSO. I'M HERE<br />TO SAY THEY ARE ALL GREAT AND DESERVE<br />MORE ATTENTION AND ANOTHER LISTEN.<br />BUT ACE'S ROCKS AND IS THE BEST OF THEM.
B0006L16N8|4.0|My daughter and grandson got me hooked on this CD.  I love the music but some of the words don't make sense.  Especially track 7 but it makes up in the music. Would buy another  Coldplay CD.
B000001ELD|4.0|gene simmons solo effort is just as you'd<br />expect. very strange, mysterious and show<br />bizzy but has some great songs. Radioactive<br />and Tunnel of Love could've been on any<br />KISS album while the rest might have made<br />Dynasty or Unmasked. It's good fun rock<br />songs with some ballads like 'see you tonite'<br />which was redone for unplugged. Gene's talent<br />is always good because he knows what the fans<br />expect from him and this is good fun.
B00008PC2O|5.0|DVD arrived in a excellent condition and quality. DVD arrived in a very timely fashion.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|After seeing them perform on So You Think You Can Dance a few months back, and then falling in love with Apologize, the CD was well worth the wait.  Not a disappointing song on the whole thing.  Perfect mix of catchy melodies, accompanying strings, acoustic guitar, and wonderful falsetto.
0800141601|5.0|Product was in excellent condition and quality upon arrival. Product arrived in a timely fashion.
B000UX6THK|4.0|I bought this from Amazon.com and between the savings and all the extras they have on the last disk, it was worth every penny.    I still have my season one because it has some of the best extras out there but I got rid of my copy of season two since the Gold box had everything that I wanted.    Now I can pass on my love of Twin Peaks to my son and eventually to my daughter, she's only 3 so it's not for her for a long time. It may have been on TV but it has some very scary moments if you don't know they are coming.    If you've never seen the show then you need to pick this up and see one of the best television shows of all time. (Plus it's got one of the best looking casts you'll ever see in one place, both male and female. Even if the plot starts to confuse you the eye candy will keep you happy!)    If you like mystery, drama, suspense, and just the right amount of humor to balance it all out then this is a show you need to check out.    Grab your doughnuts or Cherry pie, a cup of \\"damn fine coffee\\" and take a trip to Twin Peaks. You'll never look at small town life the same way again.
B00005JPS9|1.0|This was horrible. If I could give negative stars I would. Don't waste your time or money. I almost feel asleep twice during the movie. The whole plot was awful and the acting was worse. All that happens is the main character stands around yelling \\"I am Beowulf\\". The plot jumps about 30 to 40 years without notice or explanation. If your getting this because of Angela Jolie don't she was in the movie for a whole 5 minutes. It was awful. Don't bother.
B00007KWHG|5.0|All the hits you want...and none of the songs you don't want.  Great sound  quality. Don't buy \\"Jersey Boys\\" just buy this!
B000H305U0|5.0|I really have enjoyed listening to this CD. It is in excellent condition and the music is great. I received it quickly and would use amazon and this seller again.
B000ICXQXS|5.0|Amazing film - for the entire family. Drama, comedy, suspense, exceedingly clever scenes by two of America's greatest actors, Redford & Newman, as well as one of Britain's greatest, the late Robert Shaw.  And, especially, the unpredictable conclusion.  My personal favorite of all time.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Finally, a complete set all of the episodes of Twin Peaks, including the crucial two-hour pilot that preceded the show's two-year network TV run.  The extensive current interviews with David Lynch, Mark Frost, Kyle McClachlan and other members of the cast and crew alone make this collector's edition well worth the price. The interview with the composer of the haunting Twin Peaks' music is especially fascinating.  Watching the[[ASIN:B000UX6THK Twin Peaks - The Definitive Gold Box Edition (The Complete Series)]]confirms that Twin Peaks was the most avant-garde network TV series ever.  A must-have collection for Twin Peaks' buffs.
0553296981|5.0|I do love this book. I read it the first time at age 12. It was upsetting to me the first time but it gave me a understanding of how she had to live and how much she wanted to live. It made me realize that something like that could happen to me if war were to break out and my family and I would have to go in hiding and to realize that a person can do things in life that you would never imagine you could do. Anne Frank was for her age a very creative writer. She told about her life and didn't try to hide anything,but she would never imagine that her diary would be found  (or did she)and that what she had written in it was just for herself a way she could express the pain and sometimes joy she felt. I recommend everyone to read this book and think about how you would feel if you had been in her shoes.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|The memory is the embodiment of time. 2046 is the year in which people want to go in order to search his lost memories. But nobody can an accurate answer because nobody has gone back.<br /><br />But there's a man who is really convinced he must undertake the journey to the past, because he is really convinced something must  be done.<br /><br />This is an engaging and admirable script, that deals with these inextricable labyrinths of the time. If we make some memory we should turn our attention toward three transcendental movies which are related with this issue, such as \\"Last year in Mariembad\\",  Three cornets for a sailor, and more recently Twelve monkeys to feel this peculiar and poetic film, whose enigmatic plot focuses around the reconstruction of these broken dreams that are part from our existence, like a cup filled not only of dreams but illusions, hopes that many times not depend entirely from us.<br /><br />You should get this DVD, because of its powerful mesmerizing and poetic statement.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is a classic that children have loved all over the world and for many years. It is a story that never grows old. It was my pleasure to be able to give it to my grandsons and to my great niece and nephew for Christmas. I hope they enjoy it as much as I enjoyed getting it for them!  Children four and up will enjoy this DVD and never tire of it.
B0002UOK04|5.0|The title sums it up.....once your done listening to this album...theres no need to live.. you can die happy.    If God Listened to metal..it would be this.    Truly a milestone for metal world wide    Extremely Melodic and heavy...Gorgeous music that gives the illusion for gorgeous settings    Standout tracks are thus    Sleeping Stars-Starts off slow with a very mellow baseline. then It kicks into prolly one of the most addicting riffs ive ever heard...the best part is is thatits re occuring ha    Starchild-Very very very compllex song...Everything about it...its very uplifting and emotional.     BEAUTIFUL DEATH-Probably one of my favorite songs of all time. A very powerful and aggresive song. Very atmospheric. The lyrics are some of the best ive heard. Jaro definately took his time with writing it. Masterfully done, and the drum work is incredible
1564029654|5.0|This is a cute story with beautiful illustrations. The repetition is great for little ones and it can also be used to address issues with seperation anxiety.
6300181553|5.0|I agree with the majority of the reviewers that this is a great movie to watch around Christmas. The Abe Lincoln song is, by today's standard, at the very least condescending and demeaning. I wouldn't go as far as racist since the song is suportive of Lincoln;s anti -slavery efforts.     on a personal note this movie takes me back to my granparents house, a beautiful home in upsate new york. When I hear Bing sinf it's like my grandparetns arer back alive and with me. Obvioulsy anything that can evoke such memories is a classic.
0143142364|2.0|WAY TOO LONG (12 hrs!!), come on!!!!    I understand the book is 1,000+ pages.  Ken Follett went on way too long with an even longer cast of characters.  If I were reading the book I'd have to keep an outline just of the characters.  Pillars of the Earth was wonderful, but this one is just an exercise in verbosity!!
B00092ZMDY|4.0|I made the mistake as it turns out of ordering the HD copy as I have an HD TV set.  What I found out is that neither of my DVD players could play the HD version.  So it will need to be returned and I will order the non HD version.  It would be nice to know that one will need to have the proper gear to play the HD copy before ordering.  Just be sure that your equipment can play it before you order the disc. I will get the version that I \\"can\\" play and all should then be fine.
B00003CX9E|4.0|This collection consists of two disks--a digitized version of the original film and the documentary from the PBS American Masters series that detailed its history.    The film transfer itself is badly posterized. (This means that there are very few levels of gray between total black and total white.) This may be inherent in the print or quality of the negative. If so, there's nothing that can be done about it using today's technology. Despite this problem, it is quite viewable. The audio is in much better shape, however, and the recovery there seems to have gone quite smoothly.     The American Experience doc is first-rate. It not only tells the story of the effort to suppress Kane, but how the two egoistic giants--Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst--almost destroyed themselves in the battle over the picture. The backstage stories of Welles' excessive lifestyle, treatment of his Mercury players, and personal background that made Citizen Kane ultimately more the story of Welles life than of Hearst's are first-rate.     In all, it's a great package that probably does as good a job of restoring this film as today's technology is capable of producing.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The work done by father and son Martin team is amazing.  This really makes the music alive and new.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Purchased this originally over a year ago and just purchased two more copies for my parents and in-laws.  The reason, the CD is wonderfully produced and the music and sound are both top quality.  My wife and I enjoyed seeing the national tour of the broadway show Jersey Boys this year and are sending our parents to a show later this year and the CD and the tickets to the show is their Christmas present this year!    Brian
B00009MGGI|5.0|This cynical view of a British politician's rise to power is great fun.  All three series are worth watching, but the first is clearly the best.  The Urquharts are modern Macbeths, and Ian Richardson's portrayal is indelible.
0553589059|5.0|Best book yet.      At least of her science fiction, anyway, I haven't read the rest.  It seems that not content with being the 21st century Gordon R. Dickson with Military SF and Dragons, or the 21st century Randall Garrett with period sorcerer detectives, monster hunters, and animal companions, she is aiming for the 21st century Melissa Scott niche, too.    That is exactly what this book reminded me of, being instantly dumped into a milieu that is both recognisably human and alien, and just different, right from the start.  This is something that Scott is great at, and showing the day to day situations of such people in the future and on other planets.    Quantum probabilities is what this is all about, as one particular planetary colony is a source for a very strange substance that facilitates interstellar communication and transport by quantum methods.  Naturally, this makes the corporation in control a lot of money.    They use the local amphibious aliens as workers, 'coolies' mostly in fact as well as name to mine this substance, as they work well in the water.    The case of characters includes a hitman, a Scarlet Witchesque probability manipulator, an information broker, a secret agent, and your standard repressive corporate executives, and a few clones.    When one of these people is killed, the dying information burst she sends begins to uncover a lot of secrets, and leads to a complicated conflict involving the aliens, the locals, the governing corporation, and more than one probability storm.    Very well done.      4.5 out of 5
0380725398|5.0|After recently reading Rebecca by Du Maurier, I decided to read another of her novels, and this was #2 in a collection I received from my local library. Though I did like Rebecca quite a bit, this one absolutely blew me away.    Jamaica Inn and Du Maurier kept me guessing til the bitter end. Furthermore, Du Maurier's characterizations and incredible use of metaphor have you living, breathing, and dreaming in the moors of the English hills, through the eyes of her often troubled female heroines.    You will be enraged, disgusted, enthralled, and wanting more throughout every page of the novel. Though I'm in the midst of a house move and have a very active toddler, I spent every free minute in the last couple days with my nose in this book!    In other reviews I'd read people mentioned they weren't thrilled with the ending; to that end, the very last two pages were a bit much, but the actual denoument of the book was fantastique!!!    FIVE STARS for another novel well written and much appreciated. Too bad there are not many authors like Du Maurier that find their way into print anymore (but if so, email me whom they are!)
0765357151|5.0|I'm not going to summarize this book as you can just read Amazon's description.  I just want to put in my 5 stars and let anyone thinking about reading this know that it is a great book.  It's pretty short, only about 150 pages, (there are other short stories that come with this book), and very effective.  Don't expect scary, gory vampires.  This book works like an episode of the Twilight Zone, it's kind of scary throughout and then the ending is what really gives you the chills.<br />On a side note -- it looks like Hollywood is going to twist this one all around and turn it into a Ford Mustang commercial!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I am so glad this is finally out (again) on DVD. This is, hands down, one of the best shows ever made. The extras a great too.
B000XPU5NY|1.0|its sad...the money being made on a lifeless performance.theres no excuses.Im a life long fan.i have seen and heard genesis for over 30 yrs.i still bought this cd ,because i love who genesis was.even the great instrumentals are bland and lifeless.nothing is electric.the song set is a farce.even the good songs are edited.no complete epic songs.all edited and bland.for new fans you may not notice.for any one who has any experience,just a sad sad represantation of a band who performed and played some of the best music has to offer.
0920668372|5.0|I read through almost ALL of the reviews posted on Amazon for this book, yet what everyone fails to recognize-- or at least mention-- it that this is a children's book that has ADULTS divided. Simple language, basic illustrations, yet there are so many themes running through its pages.     The first time I read it, I was only about 8. And I sat in the library and cried my eyes out. It's not only about unconditional love between a mother and her son-- it's between a PARENT and CHILD. Our society is so used to mother-son and father-daughter bonds (commercials, movies) that the author probably felt a mother-son relationship would resonate with the audience better. How about the fact that the author-- a male-- actually came up with the song for his wife after she miscarried TWICE?     There's also the continuance of the same bond when the mother passes away at the end (that's what I first thought at 8; I still feel that way), as the father goes to his baby daughter to sing her the song-- keeping that cycle of a loving parent and child going. And what are the odds that the little girl will do the same for her child 30 years down the line?    What about the mother rocking her baby/child/teenager/grown son as he sleep? Think back to your own childhood-- what always made you feel better after a horrible day at school or when you were ill? A mother's HUG. That embrace. I'm the LAST person on earth to be sappy and emotional, but as humans we are built in a way that physical contact reinforces emotional bonds-- a simple hug does SO MUCH.     The mother doesn't crawl in a creepy way into her child's room-- she goes in quietly because who in their right mind is going to wake up a sleeping child??? Ok, the driving across the city and going through her son's window-- it's actually a funny image, when you think about it-- and SYMBOLIC. Not even distance will keep a parent from THINKING of their child, even if a far-fetched situation results from it. How many people travel across the country to meet with someone they love? The scene is an exaggeration!     What is sad is that all of the pedophiles and predators out there have destroyed the sanctity of a parent-child/adult-child relationship; that's why people who think this book is 'creepy' feel that way. We are bombarded with images and stories of children being mistreated that the act of pure love (in a friggin' children's book) is misconstrued and misunderstood.    Another angle: the child begins to realize how much his mother loves him, and he tests it repeatedly. He goes through the typical adolescence phase of rebellion, the usual independence phase-- all because he knows that his mother will love him no matter what at the end.    I'm a female, and I know that if my mother gave me as much love as the mother in this book, I would have had a much better childhood and adolescence. Why do children kill themselves to be \\"the best\\" instead of taking advantage of their childhood? Why do teens constantly strive to outdo everyone else, taking up a million activities and classes, leaving them no time to find out what THEY want and who they are? All to please their parents. It's when the child does not receive the love and understanding of their parents at home that he/she seeks it elsewhere-- acceptance-- and sometimes begins their path to self-destruction (drugs, gangs, violence). Yes, it's not as simple as saying \\"I love you\\" or giving  them a hug, but that's where it starts.
B000SQKZKG|5.0|This was my introduction to ELP, and it is still one of my all time favorites.  When it came out, it was a triple album (most bands can barely fill one album, let alone three).  Triple albums were rarely done back in the vinyl days.  Only Frank Zappa (who released many triple albums, like Thing-Fish and the Shut Up and Play Yer Guitar series) and The Clash (with Sandinista!) are the only ones that ring a bell.  ELP have enough invention and creativity to fill a 3 LP set and then some.  The album reached #4 on the chart, which shows the immense popularity (deservedly so) for this band.  Many found them bombastic and over the top, but that's the bloody point, isn't it?  The music is larger than life, it's spectacular!  There are only 8 tracks on the whole album, and it covers ELP's best stuff.  The live Karn Evil 9 is worth buying the CD for.  If bands today had only half the imagination and stamina of ELP, the world would be a better place.  Critics found them pretentious, but who would you rather see?  Rock critics performing, or 3 great musicians performing.  This is a band that never released a godawful album (even Love Beach and In the Hot Seat have their moments).  Their sheer talent came through in every note.  ELP rules!
B000RG1FMO|1.0|Don't waste your time it's TRASH. I would rate it zero stars if I could.
0395389496|5.0|I love this book! It reminds me of being a kid. The story is so different in a wonderful way and the pictures are beautiful!
0525950079|5.0|I enjoyed the book more than anything that I have read in a long time.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|We unexpectantly bought tickets to see A New Journey live after placing this order for the DVD.  There were some additional selections on this DVD that weren't performed during the show........so that was a wonderful surprise.  This is a DVD that will be watched again and again.  If you are a Celtic Woman fan..........this DVD is a MUST!!
B000VBIEXS|4.0|I don't rate this album very highly, despite it being touted as ELP's finest studio album.  I bought the triple live album first, and that has 4 out of the 5 songs here.  The only track not on the live album was the 2 minunte throwaway Benny the Bouncer.  It's a good song, but it's not worth buying the whole album for if you already have the triple live album.  The studio version of Jerusalem is pretty good, and you can understand the lyrics better.  And I have to admit I like the quieter version of Still...You Turn Me On from the live album.  The studio version here is good, but is a little overboard with the instrumentation.  The live versions of Toccata and especially Karn Evil 9 dwarf the versions here.  And another complaint.  Why didn't they release the title track on this album?  For some bizarre reason, the song Brain Salad Surgery (a great title) wasn't put on the record, and ended up appearing on Works, Vol. 2 (which was mostly leftover material from these sessions).  So, overall, it's a rather mixed bag for me.
B000V7O0H6|4.0|Although the movie is not as good as it could be the picture looks great and the sound is awesome. Worth your time if your a Superman fan.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I wasn't expecting much out of this two-CD set. I've been a huge Eagles fan since the early 1970s, have seen them at least 7 times in concert, and know the words to almost every one of their songs. But the fact that The Long Run had some songs I didn't really like, the fact that the four new songs they released on Hell Freezes Over were only OK to good, and the fact that it had been 28 years since their last full-length release left me with low expectations for this CD. But on my first listen to it the music simply blew me away. I can't believe how great this music sounds, and there are only maybe two songs out of the 20 that I thought weren't up to the quality of the other 18 songs. But on my second listen I even began liking those other two songs, too!    I can't stop listening to \\"How Long,\\" a song written by their old friend J.D. Souther. I feel like I'm listening to a current version of \\"Already Gone\\" in the way the song feels, and I can't stop smiling when I'm listening to it.    It's definitely been a long wait to hear this music, and it's an absolute thrill to be listening to it now.
1567184855|5.0|This book is the most illuminating book I have ever read in my life!! And I read A LOT of books.  This book helps to make sense of everything.  You will know what I mean after you read it.  The book is very very interesting.  I wish this guy would hypnotize me!!
B0007M22TI|5.0|This DVD was all that we thought it would be and more!  We had just seen them perform live and watching this DVD was like experiencing it all over again!  If you are a Celtic Woman fan........it's a MUST!!
B000063DS1|5.0|Have the DVD-one of the best-and had the CD which wasn't the complete \\"Last Waltz\\". This CD has it all and the fact that it is digitally remastered makes it a must not only for fans of \\"The Band\\" but for anyone who has a 5.1 Home Theatre System. Highly recommended
0316067598|5.0|Gripping, moving, \\"I - can't - put - this - one - down\\" written account of an unimaginable ordeal endured by one of our Navy Seals. Also recounts the compassion and bravery of a small group of Afghani mountain villagers who stood their ground and refused to be intimidated by significantly larger and better armed Taliban forces, to protect their guest, the author. Navy Seal training is described, as is the intense, coming together of a small Texas town waiting to hear if one of their own has been killed, or just might have survived. Superbly written.
0446577391|3.0|Another entertaining novel by Baldacci.  I have enjoyed all of the Camel Club books, although I found this to be the weakest effort of the group.  In the others, the Camel Club prevailed based upon their wits.  This time, it is firepower that makes the difference and I believe the novel suffers a bit as a result.  Nevertheless, the novel is still worthy of being read.
076531178X|5.0|This book has a great cast of interesting characters and it is a very very good story!
0439882826|5.0|We bought this for a Star Wars fanatic and were delighted with the results. There are 4 or 5 large pop ups and dozens of smaller pop-ups.  Whoever designed this did an EXCELLENT job!!  Plus at the end of the book are glowing light saber pop-up figures.  Very well done!
B000UOOT1W|5.0|IF YOU DONT ALREADY HAVE A SANTANA CD, THIS IS THE ONE TO GET!  AND IF YOU ARE A SANTANA FAN, YOU DONT WANT TO MISS GETTING THIS ONE!
B000HT386M|3.0|There's a lot of good work here: the story, the special effects are very good. There's a number of good supporting performances (Beckinsale, Winkler, and especially Walken) along with a good lead performance from Sandler. What they left out was the laughs. The dog humping the toy duck the 1st time was okay but the 10th time, it's evidence they can't think of anything funny to say or do. An okay film but unfortunately, the laughs are limited here.
160024131X|5.0|There are many stories in American history of heroic individual efforts, which combine to make us a great nation. Add the story of Marcus Luttrell to the list. Faced with the most difficult moral decision in modern warfare, who is the enemy?  He and his men make the compassionate American decision in the mountains of Afghanistan. This decision cost the lives of his men and several other American soldiers, but the compassion, courage and bravery of our fighting men and women in this story make me proud to be an American. This book is a true-life adrenaline rush from start to finish on the modern battlefield in the War on Terrorism.
0385522401|5.0|The story revolves around nervous newlyweds Florence and Edward with honeymoon expectations not unlike those of any other period in time. She:scared and reluctant. He: eager and expectant. In the hands of another writer, this story might lead down a melodramatic path, or even one that goes nowhere. The skill of the book lies in the author's delicate handling of the honeymoon, which is literary voyeurism at its best. But what grounds this book is McEwan's deft contrast of this couple against the environment in which they live: England in 1962. In many ways prim England and fun-seeking 1962 are just as different as Florence and Edward, and perhaps this was the author's intention. If so, it works.
B000002I6T|5.0|This was one of those albums that from the moment I put it on the turntable many years ago, I was hooked for life.  It was mesmerizing!  For some reason, it  fell into obscurity until recently when it was finally put out on CD.  I urge anyone out there to pick this up and give it a listen.  An amazing talented gathering of the who's who in the late 60's SF, and a master in David Crosby to bring them all together and record some of his most brilliant music!
B000M341QE|4.0|The Departed is another future classic movie directed by Martin Scorsese.  The all star cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Billy Costigan (a rookie cop). In addition, Jack Nicholson plays (mob boss Frank Costello). Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen play investigative detectives. Matt Damon does a good job of playing Collin Sullivan, who is an SUI officer.  This movie is full of backstabbing and complex plots that are a little difficult to follow. There is action from the opening until the closing of the movie. I had to take one star away from my final rating because this movie is a little too long. It runs about 151 minutes which is 2 hours and 30 minutes. Be prepared to pause your DVD player and take a short break. However, the actors are all believable and very talented.  The ending is surprising which is good.   I rate this movie with 4 stars.
B000M39HB8|3.0|Very cute holiday movie since Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire are fun and entertining. The video was of good quality and the download was easy, but I was disappointed that it was difficult to create a back-up disc and I was unable to convert the file to a form that is able to be viewed on TV.  It will unfortunately only be viewable on PC.
6304712499|1.0|What a wealth of stories they runined with this poorly thrown together movie! For its time the graphics were amazing but they could have tried a little bit harder with the story. This film was pure cheese.     Waste of time. Get the [[ASIN:B000Q66PX4 Todd McFarlane's Spawn: Animated Collection (4pc)]] with all seasons for a better angle on the story.     ditch this poo pile.
B00009YXHN|4.0|When going into Bride of Re-Animator, you have to accept a few facts.  Stuart Gordon is not at the helm here (replaced by the series' producer Brian Yuzna), and much of the horriffic moments of the original film are absent as well.  What you get instead is a pretty enjoyable, and pretty gross, sequel to the late 80's classic that is doesn't try to outdo the original.  The film picks up months after the events of the first film, with Dr. Herbert West (the great Jeffrey Combs) and Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) still performing their experiments in bringing back the dead, and soon enough, plan to bring back Dan's dead girlfriend Meg using various body parts harvested from the morgue.  Standing in their way though is a shady cop (Claude Earl Jones) who has a special interest in their work, and the return of the beheaded Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) who has a score to settle with Dr. West.  Featuring some great makeup and gore effects courtesy of Screaming Mad George and KNB Effects, Bride of Re-Animator features some imaginitive effects for the low budget it has, but what ultimately hurts the film is some non-sensical leaps in logic, plot holes, and some inconsistencies with the events of the first film.  Despite all that though, Bride of Re-Animator is an underrated sequel to a splatter classic, and if you enjoyed the first film in the very least, this first sequel is worth a look.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I've always been a fan of this period in History. King Henry marries 6 different women, and this is yet another take on how it all happened.<br /><br />Now, I am not a huge history buff, but the storyline is pretty accurate. Henry takes over the throne at a young age and is married off to his dead brother's wife, Katherine of Aragon. She was much older than Henry, (as she appears in the miniseries) and there was some dispute about if her first marriage had been consummated or not.<br /><br />Kind Henry was known for his sexual exploitations, which are shown here with women that are simply gorgeous. He eventually meets Anne Boleyn, a seductive woman that I found to look perfect for the part. She is rather unusual looking, with tilted eyes and a coy look on her face. The real Anne was not much to look at, but had \\"seductive eyes\\". Good casting all around.<br /><br />This miniseries only shows a small chunk out of the Tudor history. By the end of the first season, King Henry is still married to Katherine, and has not yet married Anne, something we all know eventually happens.<br /><br />I cannot wait to see more of this series! There are other smaller story lines that keep the plot moving and show other characters during this time period, the costuming is gorgeous and pretty accurate, and the whole show is hard to tear your eyes away from. King Henry himself is VERY good looking, so I can imagine falling for him myself, if I was back in that time period.

0140277447|4.0|Many people have a general awareness that Japan was one of the more violent and barbaric nations on earth prior to being bombed into pacifism and docility by the United States.  But such a description is rather generic, lacking the meat on the bones narrative that really allows the reality to come to life.  Iris Chang changed that situation dramatically with THE RAPE OF NANKING, in which she introduced not only the Nanking atrocities, but Japanese barbarism of the period, to a wider audience.    Chang did extensive research for the book, including interviewing Nanking survivors and using diaries, photographs and film of various Westerners in the city at the time.  The result is one of the more heartbreaking books one is likely to come across.  Indeed, one friend of mine returned the book unread despite having specifically requested to borrow it.  The book was so disturbing that she just could not get very far into it without becoming too emotionally agitated.    The atrocities described in THE RAPE OF NANKING are indeed horrific and it takes some spine to get through them.  Simple rape and decapitation were just the appetizers.  Some of the more inhumane tortures were so gruesome that it leaves a reviewer in the position of being considered indelicate simply for describing them here.  On a brighter note (a relative phrase here, to be sure), Chang also discusses the efforts of those who tried their hardest to save as many lives as possible.  War really does bring out the best and worst of mankind.    Despite Chang's extensive research, she failed to do any research in Japan itself.  Of course, any official Japanese statement must be taken with a grain of salt, yet other sources within that nation should have been used.  The book is not without errors that a simple internet search will reveal and, although that may be true of any historical book, a broader research inventory might have been helpful.  I saw Chang speak once and, although she was not overtly hostile tothe Japanese, I found her to be slanted enough that I could not help but wonder whether it affected her research.  I do not mean that to be negative, but just a thought.    Any defects in Chang's research, however, are minor compared to the overall picture.  Anyone thinking of going to Hiroshima to protest against American militarism should read THE RAPE OF NANKING instead and save the two thousand bucks in plane fare.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera movie brought this classic tale to life in such a way that I was drawn in. It has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie so much.     Gerard Butler is the Phantom! He gives the character such a compelling personality that he draws you in and makes you feel his pain. He is incredibly handsome, moves with grace and brings a sensual quality to the phantom. His voice is very masculine and full of passion which suits the character of the Phantom. Emmy Rossum is beautiful as Christine and her sweet clear voice is wonderful.    Buy this movie and the soundtrack so you can enjoy it again and again!
B00003CXDV|5.0|Every trekkie has at one point believed that the Star Trek universe was real, (trekkers know better, and they move out of their mother's basements.) Picture the crew of a SF TV series, sick to death of conventions and the unwashed masses that adore them. Okay, the captian loves them but gets his kick in the pants... Now what would happen if the transmissions of the show were taken seriously by aliens? If they were in trouble and needed help... who would they turn to? Yes! They come to Earth and enlist the help of the less-than-sober captian who thinks it is some sort of amateur \\"shoot\\", but he descovers the truth on the return to Earth. The real fun begins when the aliens return because the badguy isn't defeated - just ticked off... One of my favorite films ever, if you were ever into sci-fi or think that scf-fi fans are head cases, it will probably entertain you. The fact that actors try to operate a fully-functional starship based on the one from the TV seris is a real hoot! Simply a 'must see' - hands down! Get a big bag of popcorn, kick back and be prepaired to laugh! (...and maybe cry - there are a few heart-wrenching moments, but they are necessary to the plot.)
B00005JPD0|3.0|In Deja Vu, Denzel Washington plays an ATF agent in New Orleans helping to investigate a bombing on a ferry carrying 400 men of the U.S. Navy and their families. He also finds himself investigating the death of a young woman whose body washed up on shore and is related to the bombing case. Along the way he meets Val Kilmer's character who works for the FBI. Kilmer brings Washington in on a special team the FBI has formed using a new technology they think will help them solve the bombing. Washington becomes suspicious of this new technology and finally gets the team to admit that in actuality they have discovered a way to go 4.5 days back in time.    Deja Vu was an enjoyable movie. It has a great look to it and the performances are all good. Then again, they don't ask anyone to do that much. Val Kilmer's FBI agent sits behind a table most of the movie and Denzel Washington could play this part in his sleep. There was no real depth to the story and they didn't make me care about it enough. The time travel technology was never explained very well and after saying early in the movie that it's impossible to send a person back, they've tried it, of course when Washington needs to go back, he survives. That's a cheap plot contrivance. The ending after he does go back makes even less sense.     If you don't think about it too much, Deja Vu is an enjoyable enough thriller.
0805079831|5.0|For the past seven years I have tried to understand what could motivate those extremists who stoop to any level of depravity in order to undermine the democratic right of free peoples to elect sound governments. I have considered the Oliver Norths and Cheneys and Rumsfelds or our era and tried to imagine how they possibly can feel good about themselves: what justifications must they use as they defecate on the prinicples of democracy that I hold dear, even as they enrich themselves by pillaging the welfare state they so long to destroy (as though corporate theft from the taxpayer were truly a \\"free market\\" success)?     This book provides a disturbing answer. It brilliantly connects the dots between the capitalist fundamentalists who hate sound government and the political extremists who steal elections and even torture and kill for them. It places both groups squarely on the fringe of unreality shared by Communists, Islamist terrorists, and ideologically blind people of all kinds. It exposes the radical mentality that accounts for the most sinister acts of our foreign policy as well as the likelihood that any charismatic and progressive leader here at home would likely end up murdered, as did JFK, MLK, and RFK.     As the Soviets enslaved their people to the State in the name of \\"Equality,\\" so the Neoliberals/Neocons work to enslave us to the Economy in the name of \\"Freedom.\\" Like the Communists and the Islamists, the Neocons  envision a utopia created by the violent enforcement of fundamantal principles. This vision is predicated on a tumor-like economy that grows endlessly due to ever-increasing consumption, regardless of the consequences for the health of people or the earth we live on.     I am grateful that this book was written. I pray that it will permeate the American psyche, to help us restore the balance we need between the great benefits of free enterprise and the democratically imposed constraints needed to protect us from the abuses of wanton greed.
B00049QQHI|5.0|The late Jimmy Stewart used to stress time and again that acting should look natural to  the viewer. Leo Di  Caprio certainly fills the bill in this movie, which should be a mandatory primer for all young actors to view. In a stunning portrayal of James Carroll, DiCaprio leads us down the path of adolescent destruction  caused in part by adult abuse, negative peer pressure, a shaky home situation, and one's own self will. This is definitely not your routine jock-sports movie. In fact, the movie's title may actually steer some potential viewers away from purchasing it. No, this is the real thing,scenes of which this reviewer saw too many times in his career.The path to drug self destruction is different for everyone. In Carroll's case, he somehow survived, accompanied by his urine stained notebook/diary. Would a trustworthy adult or counselor have been able to prevent all the mayhem? Possibly. In any event, this is definitely not the type of film that will ever appear in primetime national television. It should! This is the most realistic film with the best acting by one person these eyes have ever seen.
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|For those who haven't seen the movie, be aware that most of the songs on this \\"soundtrack\\" are not used in the movie.  The movie uses more originals than covers, which is as it should be.  Nonetheless, this is a good collection of covers.  I'm a pretty big Dylan fan, but there are a couple songs on here that I had never heard of (such as \\"Billy 1\\").  Some of the songs presented here should not be covered by anyone, but these artists do their best.  For instance, Eddie Vedder does a decent version of \\"All Along The Watchtower\\", but no one could ever approach Hendrix's cover or Dylan's version from the Concert For The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  As some critics have noted, some of these artists are too reverent toward the originals and, therefore, add nothing to them (one song even has a Dylanesque harmonica solo--why??).<br /><br />Having said that, rest assured that there are a number of excellent songs here.  Marcus Carl Franklin (the black kid in the movie) does an outstanding version of \\"When The Ship Comes In.\\"  John Doe does a great job on two songs (\\"Pressing On\\" and \\"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\\").  Richie Havens gives us a very energetic performance of \\"Tombstone Blues.\\"  Stephen Malkmus does a nice version of \\"Ballad Of a Thin Man\\" (used to great effect in the movie).  I've never heard of Bob Forrest, but he does very well with \\"Moonshiner.\\"  I also really like Cat Power's version of \\"Stuck Inside Of Mobile...\\"<br /><br />There are a few misses on this album, as you would expect, but it's very good overall.  Ramblin' Jack Elliott tries his best with \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\", but his voice is shot (he's probably even older than Dylan).  I like Willie Nelson, but his typically lazy singing on \\"Senor\\" can't compare to Dylan's powerful vocals on the original.<br /><br />I'm one of those who think that covers almost never match up to the originals.  However, this is a worthwhile collection for any Dylan fan.  And make sure you go see the movie.  It's a priceless experience for any Dylan fan (it's even better if you've seen Don't Look Back and the recently released Live at Newport Folk Festival 1963-65 DVD).Dylan fan (it's even better if you've seen Don't Look Back and the recently released Live at Newport Folk Festival 1963-65 DVD).
B000WGZGNS|5.0|Once you have seen Beyonce' Knowles live in concert, you will have a new respect for her.  I had the pleasure of attending \\"The Beyonce' Experience\\" when it came to Washington, DC, and since then, I have adored her even more.  When Destiny's Child released their first single, \\"No, No, No\\", it was crystal clear that Beyonce' was not only the star of the group, but also the hardest working one and the one with the most potential.  With this concert on DVD, she proves my stated point.  Throughout the duration of the show, Beyonce' didn't miss a beat, nor did she forget a lyric, nor did I see much sweat!  She made it look so easy, and that impressed me a great deal.<br /><br /> When she first steps onto the stage, she asks the crowd if they are ready to be entertained.  She, without a doubt, entertains for each minute of the two hours that she is performing!  It's not easy to keep 20,000 people entertained for two hours, but somehow Beyonce' manages to accomplish this task.<br /><br />  Beyonce' performs all of her biggest hits and also gives us many doses of Destiny's Child's music.  \\"Get Me Bodied\\" stands out in my mind as one of the best performances because there was non-stop choreography, very creative outfits (she had on black and yellow, hence, her nickname is Bee), and it was simply an energetic performance.  \\"Crazy in Love\\", \\"Me, Myself and I\\", and \\"Speechless\\" are other highlights.  I loved the simplicity of the \\"Flaws and All\\" performance.  She sounded great, but she incorporated so many emotions with just one song, and it was very touching to watch (how can she make herself cry on cue, on stage??)  \\"Irreplaceable\\" is another highlight.  Not because she did anything fancy or gaudy, because she didn't, but I love the crowd participation she included, and I liked how she pointed random individuals out from the audience (I.E., she said, \\"I see you over there with that Beyonce' poster!\\")<br /><br /> In all honesty, I could go on and on boasting about this DVD, but to really bring into fruition what I am saying, you will have to see it.  This concert is recommended by me, no questions.  \\"Are you ready to be entertained?\\"into fruition what I am saying, you will have to see it.

B0006B2A42|4.0|I purchased this one to watch with my 11 year old son. It evoked good conversation about the \\"cold war\\" which he knows very little about.  His Gramma used to travel back and forth to Russia during this time and my household growing up was full of these types of discussion.    This isn't a fast paced movie and one must listen carefully to the dialogue to figure out the mystery. I am very satisfied with it overall.   Don't expect high tech scenery or effects, just a well written story.
B000XA5K4I|2.0|After reading the title, a majority of moviegoers think of gun action and they are right, but mindless action that is. Director Michael Davis's original concept--in which at first was verbally explained--was not taken seriously by several studios. He literally illustrated a 17- minute reel of animation which consisted of 17,000 line drawings of action sequences, but those studios were still confused. I really do not know why they had such a hard time understanding his vision because when watching this film; the \\"cartoon-like\\" action was very evident. Maybe that is why New Line Cinema and CEO Bob Shay understood his weird vision and gave him the green light. The character development, and most importantly the action cannot even save this rascally \\"rabbit\\" of a movie.<br /><br />It's night time in a desolate part of the city. Mr. Smith (Clive Owen)--not to be confused with Agent Smith from The Matrix--is sitting on a city bench; minding his own business, when he notices a blond pregnant woman who is walking by. At first, he is not very surprised about her appearance but within moments, he notices that she is in distress and ready to go into labor. However within split seconds; a car suddenly rushes by and crashes into another parked vehicle. The assailment immediately leaves his wrecked car and pursues his powerless victim but Smith simply cannot allow his atrocity to occur and follows the two into the building. Meanwhile Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti) and the rest of his motley crew of thugs arrive at the scene and join in the pursuit of the pregnant woman. Within moments, they soon discover Smith and start rapidly firing an array of bullets from the different weapons that they have but do little damage to our hero as he pursues the woman. He delivers the baby while killing all the thugs around him. Then he escapes with the new born baby but the new mother didn't make it.<br /><br />He takes the baby to a place of safety where he joins up with a prostitute (Monica Bellucci [Donna].) Then he takes her and the baby to another secured shelter and must now go after Hertz, to find out why he wants this baby dead. What will happen to our hero? Is this simply a case of revenge or something much more complicated?<br /><br />Shoot `Em Up should have never gotten the green light. Director Michael Davis begins the movie as if it was a sequel from a prior film--as a Matrix Reloaded was to Matrix Revolutions, where it is understandable to have action to start a movie. Any good director with experience knows to begin a movie with background information of who the main characters are and how the story revolves around them. Shoot `Em Up begins with a bam!<br /><br />Then the Director gives us vague references in the story that Smith may have been in the military, perhaps Special Forces or maybe he is a solider of fortune, but we have to guess through weak clues such as putting his lady friend into a tank or when he goes into a gun store to purchase weapons and ammunition. Mr. Hertz is the bad guy who wants the baby dead, but who is this person? Does he work for the Government of the United States? Is he involved with organized crime? The only information we receive has nothing to do with the plot, such as talking to his wife on the phone or how he shows his dislike to Smith--he might have a personal vendetta but some vague information about him appears way too late in the film. We have confusion and boredom; the focal point of the movie is the baby!<br /><br />The action is plenty but cartoon-like and soulless. It was quite clear that this is a live action spoof of other films from the genre--The Transporter and Crank. There are references to Bugs Bunny and The Road Runner (with the acme traps) with Smith eating carrots and making wise cracks. Then there is Hertz responding back with \\"you're a rascally little rabbit!\\" Is Davis making fun of Warner Brothers or Looney Tunes cartoons? Therefore, the action was unrealistic and this would be acceptableif the promotion for this film was marketed towards this theme. It leaves the audience perplexed.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Please, enter at your risk. Shoot `Em Up leaves you wondering about the direction. We can see why several studios rejected this movie because they were probably confused with the director's concept (those thousands of drawings). It leaves you wondering what New Line Cinema was thinking.<br /><br />The movie appears to be a satire on the genre or themed towards Looney Tunes? The non existent character development; comical killings, not enough information and plenty of unrealistic action--which has no merit and the visuals become monotonous. Perhaps Clive's character in this film is a way of saying that he should have been the next James Bond, but this is not the way to do it.keted towards this theme.

B000WQW988|5.0|Thanks to the legal hijinks that dragged on long after Kurt Cobain's death, anything Nirvana-related was put on hold.  After the legal resolution a couple of years ago, a 3-cd set of unreleased recordings saw the light of day ([[ASIN:B00065XJ4S With The Lights Out]]), not to mention the obligatory \\"best of\\" ([[ASIN:B00006V9A0 Nirvana]]).  Now finally comes the somewhat legendary \\"MTV Unplugged\\" show.  This set still draws some mixed reactions, even if most fans agree it's brilliant.  Taped just months before Cobain's suicide, it's both startingly raw and disturbingly planned, with the band playing amongst candles and flowers (stargazer lilies, to be precise)--more than a few people noted it seemed like a funeral, and indeed that's the way Cobain intended it.  Other details that stand out include the fact that while most of the band sit propped on wooden stools, Cobain sits in what appears to be a standard swiveling office chair (\\"I have very bad posture,\\" indeed!) and the presence of ex-Germ (and future Foo Fighter) Pat Smear, who backs Cobain up as a second guitarist.  Anyway, for all its emblamatic status, \\"Unplugged\\" also gave a somewhat false impression of the band, and Cobain in particular.  Instead of the decidedly plugged in punk the band was known for, Cobain was transformed into a pained-looking, cardigan sweater wearing ghost warbling about how Jesus didn't want him for a sunbeam.  Another MTV broadcast, taped just a few months before \\"Unplugged\\" the suitably-named \\"Live and Loud\\" show, could restore the balance somewhat, but of course it hasn't been officially released on DVD yet.  Nevertheless, \\"Unplugged\\" retains an almost atavistic hold on the viewer, and is still one of the most intense musical performances ever broadcast on television.<br /><br />Instead of a basic acoustic run-through of their hits, the band used the opportunity to put a new spin on some of their album tracks.  The songs \\"Polly\\" and \\"Dumb\\" were pretty much unplugged before, but in the context of this show became brillianty-etched character studies.  The main character, however, was always Cobain, and his songs constant references to death and alienation became all the more chilling here.  \\"Unplugged\\" is, therefore, something of an audiovisual suicide note.  No suicide note has been as exhilerating as this one, though.  If you never believed in the concept of catharsis, this might chance your mind.<br /><br />The band also used the show to highlight some of their own favorite music, and five of the songs here are covers, all of them given new life by their inclusion here.  David Bowie's \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" now seems like Cobain speaking from his grave, even if he wasn't dead yet.  The tradional ballad \\"Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam\\" was performed by one of Cobain's favorite bands, The Vaselines, but this version was both tribute and personal statement.  Three songs from [[ASIN:B00000I9KU Meat Puppets II]], with Chris and Kurt Kirkwood from that band joining in, also seemed handpicked for their metaphorical content, most notably the damnation-themed \\"Lake of Fire.\\"<br /><br />What makes this DVD more than just a keepsake is the fact that the entire performance, complete with between song banter and mistakes, are included, as well as the original broadcast version.  The uncut \\"Unplugged\\" also has 14 songs, compared with the broadcast version's 12.  Of course, all the songs can be found on the CD version ([[ASIN:B000003TB9 MTV Unplugged in New York]]), but now it's available in full 5.1 glory (and done remarkably well, I might add).  The long version also includes a very brief, abortive version of \\"Sweet Home Alabama,\\" done as \\"the Brothers Meat\\" (as Cobain says) were setting up.  While the retrospective documentary also included here is disapointinly light on information, it does include a short clip of Sonic Youth's Lee Renaldo, who was at the taping.  So while this is pretty much essential for fans, even the curious will want tocheck this out.  Hopefully, some of Nirvana's electric performances will be released soon, but this is still a unique performance that easily transcends the era when it was done.ly, some of Nirvana's electric performances will be released soon, but this is still a unique performance that easily transcends the era when it was done.

B000VT55G4|3.0|After seeing all the one star reviews, I almost didn't watch this movie. I'm glad I ignored them. I actually liked it. Question. How  many action movies have you seen where one untrained guy or a few untrained people go against all odds fighting highly trained, well equipped mercenaries, rouge government agents, etc, etc? Answer: Just about all of them, so why complain it. For an action movie, I thought this was pretty good. Everyone has a right to their own opinion, but for those of you thinking about watching this, I have one friendly comment. Make up your own mind about it. If I decided not to watch movies based on bad reviews, I can tell I would've missed a lot of good movies. My opinion... good entertainment. Good popcorn movie. No one in this movie is going to win \\"best-actor\\"... but who cares!!!

B000001FV1|4.0|Whether or not you're interested in this particular album depends on a lot on whether you're interested in Traffic.  But if you're a Traffic fan, be sure you get the 2003 remaster rather than any other CD version.  That's because the remaster includes the full-length versions of \\"Roll Right Stones\\" and \\"(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired.\\"  Besides this remaster and the earliest (U.S.?) LP copies, ALL copies of SHOOT OUT have shortened versions of these songs.  \\"Uninspired\\" was faded out just a little early (about 15 seconds), but \\"Roll Right Stones\\" lost a full 2 minutes.  The 2003 remaster is the ONLY place to get the full-length versions on CD.    I don't know why none of this was pointed out in any advertising for the remaster or in its liner notes.    (P.S.:  Note that a few of the reviews here are referring to CD editions that contain the shorter versions of these songs.  The full, remastered version of the album is longer than 37:39, for example.)

It's a pretty simple read but with a sci-fi feel. It's hard to know if it took place in the future or the past. When I read it, I was full of questions as was the main character Jonas. At the beginning, Jonas is an 11 year-old boy with unique qualities unlike any of his friends or family. When Jonas attends the annual assignment ceremony, he has no idea what job he will receive for the rest of his life, but he could never imagine the one that he is selected for. All in all, The Giver is a remarkable one of a kind book and I highly recommend it.
B000002NCW|4.0|I'm biased anyway, being a lifelong fan of Mike's since his first recording, Tubular Bells, but I think that Voyager is definitely one of his better recordings.  There is a lot of his excellent guitar work to be heard on most tracks, though he goes very dramatic on \\"Flowers of the Forest\\", where he has a bagpipe band playing full blast, then to finish the album off he brings in the London Symphony Orchestra to play a lush arrangement of his own composition, \\"Mont St Michel\\".  Something for everyone on this album and I thoroughly recommend it.
B000XUUQQK|5.0|[[ASIN:B000XUUQQK Boogeyman 2 (2008)]]    ok, i haven't seen the movie yet but if it involves producers sam raimi, rob tapert, and divine actress renee o'connor than it's going to entertain us no matter what. they worked very hard on this film for it to only be released on dvd so as a fan i'm adding my support to show them the appreciation they deserve. these guys love what they do and who couldn't love them for that?! i hope everyone gets something out of this movie whether they purchase or rent it. cheers!
B000UD08HW|4.0|The audio is great. The video is okay. Don't get me wrong, some close ups show a lot of details, but I think the smoke and lighting(or lack thereof-some dark scenes) is the main reason the image looks soft overall. I am still VERY happy with the set and would recomend it to others.
B0002KVULG|5.0|This film has all the makings of a great horror film: fear of the unknown, fear of the dark, it has the supernatural, folk lore, ritual and psychology rolled into one. With the added bonus of Frank Langella being the sexist dracula ever.
0805079831|3.0|Naomi Klein argues that disaster capitalism and shock politics (ie, the shock doctrine) are a form of torture practiced, not upon individuals, but upon entire peoples. Obviously, she views the shock doctrine as a threat to constitutional liberty, economic security, culture, and the health of our planet.<br /><br />Klein traces the origin of disaster capitalism to the economic theories of the Chicago School of Milton Friedman, whose theories she characterizes as embodying the principle of totally unregulated free market capitalism in which the only legitimate role of government is protection of profits.<br /><br />\\"I am writing a book about Shock. About how countries are shocked - by wars, terror attacks, coups d'etat, and natural disasters. About how they are shocked again - by corporations and politicians who exploit the fear and disorientation of this first shock to push through economic shock therapy. And then how people who dare to resist this shock politics are, if necessary, shocked for a third time - by police, soldiers, and prison interrogators\\" [page 26].<br /><br />\\"I call these orchestrated raids on the public sphere in the wake of catastrophic events, combined with treatment of disasters as exciting market opportunities, 'disaster capitalism'\\" [page 6]. \\"Seen through the lens of this doctrine, the past thirty-five years look very different\\" [page 9].<br /><br />Klein's conclusion, therefore, is an elaboration of CW Mills' [[ASIN:0195133544 The Power Elite]] and the online film The Iron Triangle, that with torture-induced disorientation (which is what natural and economic disasters amount to) a community becomes susceptible to the Big Lie of the power elite - that \\"protection\\" from such disorientation in future can only be secured by erosion and elimination of traditional economic safeguards and constitutional liberties.<br /><br />A suitable companion volume would be [[ASIN:B002YX0H1S Rogue Economics: Capitalism's New Reality]] by Loretta Napoleoni.<br /><br />Recommended.
6304698526|3.0|Long drawn out plot, poor editing on car chase (see green beetle), did not age well. Regardless, this is a must see classic.
184195425X|3.0|This book left me a visceral revulsion that is similar to a memory of a scene in the movie, \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me.\\" In that scene, a fat Austin Powers was made to drink a cup of fecal matter. To this day, thinking about that propels me to vomit, literally. I almost did that while reading this book. Somehow, the lasting impressions I get in reading this novel is not the beautiful allusions to God and creation and the relationships we have with nature and the grandeur of the cosmos. Even the more uplifting passages of Chapters 21 and 22 do not erase my disgust in the descriptions of Pi's and other castaways' effort to survive by eating and killing reptiles, fish, fowl, zoo animal or another man.<br /><br />Overall, the book leaves a queasy and disturbed feeling in the mouth, as I profess to have an overactive imagination and one that remembers details. specially with those that relate to hunger, eating and digestion. Martel seems preoccupied with a lot of disgusting details relating to how if man was driven to desperation and hunger, survival to eat is reduced to the banal, the raw and obscene.<br /><br />A case in point is the description of Pi's trying to collect and eat the Tiger's (Richard Parker) feces. \\"I popped the ball into my mouth, I couldn't eat it. The taste was acrid, but it wasn't that. It was rather my mouth's conclusion, immediate and obvious: there's nothing to be had here. It was truly waste matter, with no nutrients in it. I spat it out and was bitter at the loss of precious water. (p. 214)\\" Another stomach churning account that is left in my mind is Pi's evisceration of a turtle, and eventually drinking its blood and eating turtle morsels. Cutting of limbs of animals and humans seems to be a mainstay feature description in the book. The cannibalism in the light of vegetarianism was more than I could take.<br /><br />Never mind Richard Parker's beastly behavior and Pi's success in taming him, never mind the meerkats and the way they lived in the forest of carnivorous algae, never mind his surviving a 200+ day ordeal. The whole story was defeated by the detailed mouth and tongue disgusted impressions that it left. The struggle to survive and willfully invoke God's presence and be thankful for his presence or lack of presence is overshadowed by my vicious imaginings of stomach turning scenarios.<br /><br />The insights about French occupied Pondicherry, India circa 1977 were historical tidbits that gave some vibrant local color. The descriptions of zoos and animal upkeep in the third world were informative. Even Indian politics with Mrs. Gandhi was commendable. Descriptions of Indian food was like a field trip to the bowels of India. The culinary aromas and gustatory visions of idli, chutney, rice and sambar, spicy tamarind, and vegetable samala were all sensuous contrasts to the tragedy of castaway life were Pi's life was reduced to raw, flavorless and gummy dorados, turtles, birds and distilled sea water.  All of those parts portray the tragi-comic struggle for life in the wild, and the vexation of life as the struggle to preserve it is testament to its preciousness, its fragility and expendability.<br /><br />I would give this book a 3 instead of a 3.14.ae, never mind his surviving a 200+ day ordeal.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|At a time when Pierce Brosnan's films had grossed well over 1 billion dollars it would have been very easy for Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli to just keep doing the same thing.  Fortunately, they didn't and the result is the best 007 film since the early Connery entries. Craig fits the part like a glove and Martin Campbell keeps everything moving at a pretty good clip.  Some have complained about the casino card game going on too long but I disagree.  Keeping the \\"ball-beater\\" scene from the book (though modified -- in the book LeChifre uses a carpet beater) gives it a kind of realism even the Sean Connery films never had.  Cubby Broccoli would not have made this film.  It's to the credit of his daughter and step-son that they DID. People who talk about how buff Craig was, take a good look at Connery as well without his shirt in Dr. No.  Personally, having made a start from scratch it wouldn't hurt to redo a couple of the older titles with Craig: THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN (Bond brainwashed to asassinate \\"M\\" and his final battle with the world's deadliest killer Pistols Scaramanga) & ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.  That would be killer.  Won't happen but nice to imagine.  It wouldn't be too bad an idea to adapt Kingsley Amis' Bond novel COLONEL SUN.

B000Y7U98C|5.0|i saw this movie 3 times in the theatre...simply because it's a fantastic movie.    it's not a \\"perfect\\" film, and the only problem with it is the fact that the makers of \\"Sunshine\\" may have tried a little too hard on this film.  At the end, there is definately a feeling of ridculous overkill with the multiple plots.    HOWEVER,    that being said...this is THE greatest sci-fi film made in the last decade OR two.  i'm not kidding.  it's a beautiful film and is crafted so well you won't forget it.  i watch a LOT of films, and \\"Sunshine\\" hits the nail on the head so many times.  if you miss this film, you are missing out on a lot.  some of the scenes will just take your breath away.  it's amazing.  hell, writing this review i can't wait to see it again!    think of some of the best sci-fi films in history...like \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", and the original \\"Alien\\".  \\"Sunshine\\" opens with scenes almost taken directly out of your favorite sci-fi films...and NOT in a rip off kind of way, but in a honorable tribute.  it's so refreshing to see a sci-fi film done right again.     from the opening scene until the credits roll at the end, \\"Sunshine\\" takes itself extremely seriously and packs a HUGE punch of excitement, originality, and sheer fantastic film making.  Danny Boyle, who did superb films like \\"Trainspotting\\" and \\"28 Days Later\\" once again has nailed another genre.  sci-fi will NEVER be the same.    see this movie ASAFP!

B000XPU5NY|1.0|I'm a big fan of Collins-era Genesis, so I really don't have a problem with the setlist here, but as an earlier reviewer said, these performances have no life to them. A lot of it has to do with the fact that on almost all of the songs, they've lowered the key because Phil can't hit the high notes he was able to hit 20 to 25 years ago. As a result, a lot of the passion that existed in the original studio recordings is missing, and it really does sound like the band was just going through the motions. Thanks but no thanks, I'll stick with the studio stuff that I fell in love with.
B000VLE3GA|4.0|In a November 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Jimmy Page described his dream of Led Zeppelin being four strong musicians that, when together, formed a fifth element. Almost 40 years later, the mystique and legend that is Led Zeppelin is strong enough that the mere hint of a reunion show brought out the most jaded and reclusive fans to vie, almost 20 million strong, for the few thousand seats available to a one-off London Reunion. The death of John Bonham in 1980 and the subsequent decision of the surviving trio to call it quits closed a book on a band that stopped themselves before they sucked, even if repeated listening to [[ASIN:B000002JSP In Through the Out Door]] gave thought to notions that maybe they were past their peak.<br /><br />But all that did was add to the legend. \\"Mothership\\" (once again) proves that Led Zeppelin had no peer when it came to rocking the seventies. Deliberately cloaking themselves in mystery and excess, the music lived up to its creators' ambitions. Listening to Disc One now, remastered terrifically is like hearing the band fresh. They were experimenting sonically in ways most other 'heavy' bands at the time had not ascended to (listen to the orgasmic interplay between Page and Robert Plant on \\"Whole Lotta Love\\") and were gleefully attacking songs outside the expected parameters of Rock and Roll. (To wit: Joan Baez's \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\" and \\"When The Levee Breaks,\\" a blues song from the 1920's.)<br /><br />The first disc captures the glory of the first four albums, and ends with \\"Stairway To Heaven.\\" Say what you will, giving this a fresh listen after all these years is a payback for everytime you nailed the punch button on your FM radio for whatever billionth time that well known acoustic lick came on your car speakers. It's a masterpiece of construction, built layer upon layer of sound before finally roaring into one of rock's all time great solos. The version on \\"Mothership\\" is - no quarter - the absolute best version committed to disc.<br /><br />After that, the second CD seems less intense. The wild sense of discovery is gone, replaced by a band quite pleased with just how powerful they'd become. That isn't to say that the songs are complacent; far from it. \\"Kashmir\\" (from [[ASIN:B000002JSN Physical Graffiti]]) is stunning all these years later. That middle eastern riff marching across Bonham's tricky time signature is deceptively simplistic sounding, yet few have ever come close to duplicating its stately force. While personally I have quibbles with selections from [[ASIN:B000002JSJ Presence]] and \\"In Through The Out Door\\" (why not \\"Fool In The Rain,\\" a top 40 hit?), since Page was the producer, who am I to judge?<br /><br />For the die-hard owner of all things LZ, this won't add anything new. But the remastering makes it worth it. As for the rest of us, folks for whom Zep was something we got out of our systems by the time we were out of college and became casual fans, \\"Mothership\\" is a motherlode. It makes a terrific 24 song reminder of just how important Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham are to the creation of heard rock as we know it. Only Black Sabbath has wielded an influence of potential equality. And you can bet that once the 2008 tour gets underway, we'll finally be seeing upgrades on the under-looked Led Zeppelin CD library.r that, the second CD seems less intense.

B00080ZG10|3.0|I know, the color of the film as Hughes gets older is suppose to reflect the changes in film technology; ie: it gets better as the film progresses.<br />I think that's getting a little bit too \\"artsy\\" for me. For me, it just looks like the DVD's color is goofed up. In parts of the movie the greens are almost a fuorescent blue/green; such as the plants or the peas on his plate at the nightclub.<br />I love most any movie about Howard Hughes because he is such an interseting \\"bigger than life\\" person. And yes I enjoyed this movie; BUT it would have been much better if the color would have just been either black and white or color (Today's color film).

1577314808|1.0|I tried to read a few of Tolle's books, and despite the hype, found them to be bland, vague, humorless and uninspiring.  He doesn't come across as a real person, but rather, a gross caricature of a \\"spiritual master\\", overly serious and dry, and at times, a prude.     I try to refrain from being a cynic, though I would tend to agree with some of the other posters here, who also find Tolle to be a cleverly adept bullsh-- artist.  Upon closer inspection, his esoteric writing has no real substance.       Instead, I recommend Richard Bach, Seth / Jane Roberts, Shakti Gawain, Wayne Dyer, Stuart Hill, or Louise Hay.    Peace out, everyone.  Happy Holidays!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This is truly an awesome DVD-Audio/CD disc. The sonic quality of the DVD_Audio is superb, and anytime you can get a sonically improved version of Beatles tunes is worthwhile. Much has been said about how some of the tunes are remixed to include snippets of other Beatles tunes - I thought these remixes were masterful, and reveals how interchangeable some of the Beatles music is. They literally had their music down to a science. Even though I am young to have gone through the peak of the Beatles at the perfect teenage age (I am 50), I'm grateful to be able to appreciate such expert musicianship. There will never be a group whose vocalists come together as seamlessly as the Beatles, in perfect harmony. Their melodic compositions and lyrics are superb as well. I was fortunate to see the \\"Love\\" show in Vegas and if you have that chance, do so - it is an unforgettable evening of entertainment.    If I have any gripes about \\"Love,\\" it's that not all of my favorite Beatles tunes are included,though the disc has 26 cuts. More of the songs are from the Sgt. Pepper/White Album/Yellow Submarine era. I missed \\"If I Fell\\" and \\"Penny Lane.\\" These are small gripes, since it is impossible to put all their hits on one disc, and the \\"Love\\" show on which the DVD is based can only last so long in one evening.     If you are a Beatles fan or just a fan of well-crafted and re-imagined music, you must get this disc. The price is right too.    Thanks,    Analyst7
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Now this is time well spent!! A great DVD for the family to share. The cinematography is exceptionally beautiful, the narration is informative & high quality but never overshadows the spectacle of life taking place. This DVD gives such a great appreciation for this big, beautiful planet we all live on, you will remember it forever. A caution though, and I may be in the minority as an overly sensitive viewer, I do find the struggle of life & death a bit too painful to watch at times, though as a young person reminded me, it's natural, and he's right, it's just part of life. I just have to excuse myself from time to time and leave the room...<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD as a must-have for any home collection and it would make a quality gift for a huge range of people. Enjoy mama earth & all her beauty & wonder & appreciate the intense struggle to survive and the incredible challenges that her inhabitants face every day...<br /><br />Rai Aren
1400063515|5.0|Yes, there's a lot that readers of very streamlined books targeted at very specific audiences will find to ruffle their feathers here. So if you read books just to add \\"facts\\" to your brain (i.e., you don't really ever think, you just remember), you probably might be annoyed by the delivery of this book.    But the ideas here are original and incredibly useful. It may take thinking readers a while to understand what Taleb is talking about and to begin their own researches into exploitation of black swans. But readers that actually think rather than remember will grasp the importance and practicality of these ideas at once, because they probably already understand that there's a gulf between skills and payoffs and have been positioning themselves to take advantage of life's small black swans all along.
B000002G6J|5.0|I can't really add much to what has already been written here.  This is one of my favorites of all time.  Listening to it is like visiting with an old friend.

B00028HBL6|4.0|I am a novelist writing a book on 1st century Rome. My book has a crucifixion scene and I wanted to get the emotion tied up in such an event.    I was disappointed; the crucifixion scene in Gibson's movie was Holywood, not history. Criminals carried only the crossbeam (patibulum) to the scene of the execution. The post (stipe) was already in the ground and were more or less permanent.    I didn't see the rest of the movie, being non-religious, but 2 Catholic friends were greatly moved.
0920668372|1.0|I'm a father of two boys.  Happily married.  Well adjusted.  But honestly, when I first read this book, I thought it was quite charming, if not a bit syrupy.  But then I had a moment of clarity and realized it's a tremendously off-putting book.  If this book establishes a template for what aging love is supposed to look like, I think it's quite misleading.  I love my mother very much, but at no point do I want her to believe (even metaphorically) that she should climb into my window in order to show me how much she loves me.      I taught high school English for 12 years and met many, many, many mothers who would read this book as a wonderful model for how they should smother their children out of an act of love.    I'm surprised more people don't identify this book as truly odd.

With all the really bad horror movies that come out, I can see why some would like this movie a lot. It is much better than most of the garbage they call horror these days. I am glad I watched it, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would but, I don't think I need to see it again.

B0000009TJ|1.0|The material has been treated in friveless manner and does not have the emotive content or passion of the studio albums. I found it raucuss and not worth listening to. It sounds like they were having a good time but that is not what I want from a Zappa album. I'll stick to Zoot Allures, etc.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Pros: A more mature sound, a different style, and very unique and different feeling in each track.    It Includes a sample of her Believe Fragance, and the booklet is nice as well.    Cons: It really feels the absence of the traditional message from Britney to her fans, like the other cds, also that this is the first \\"not enhanced\\" cd. :(, It should be really good, it at least it included the video in an alternate version maybe ;)
B000F7BPLG|5.0|Good book! I get pretty mad cause reading the story you know whats going to happen and nothing can be done to change it, but Honor seems to be on top of things right away, never holding back. Flag was a definitely a good read, especially on a cold day, like those coming up!
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|This is a new review of an old record.  I like the songs, good hooks, catchy, etc.  I just have trouble listening to it because they decided the singer's voice was so crappy that they buried it with distortion into the buzzy guitar mix.  Personally, I don't think the guy's voice is so bad, so I don't get why the producers and mixing engineers ruined a good record.  Too bad you can't buy the multitrack raw cuts and make your own mix.  Yeah, I know some people claim that this is a Strokes sound thing, but in my opinion it is just crappy production.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This is a very endearing film.  This is a movie any one of any age can enjoy.  My toddler watches it and has learned alot about caring and kindheartedness.  My 68 year old father in law watched it and loved it just as much!  It's one of the few films you can feel good about seeing and can watch over and over again and enjoy it every time!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I would add to what's been said above, that this is a wonderful time capsule that might be entitled \\"and now for something completely different\\".

B000Y7U98C|5.0|\\"Sunshine\\" was without a doubt the best sci-fi film of 2007.  I don't know why it only saw limited release.  I agree with Dana Stevens of Slate Magazine: this just misses classic greatness.  The cinematography of \\"Sunshine\\" looks spectacular.  The plot keeps piling on the tension.  Some elements have been done before, but director Danny Boyle makes it all seem new.    Ironically, and probably unintentionally, \\"Sunshine\\" makes the case for unmanned space missions.  If the human crew is going to override the computer, it's better (and cheaper) to just send the computer.  But nobody is going to make a thrilling adventure movie about an unmanned spaceship.
0143038419|1.0|This was a self-indulgent, waste of time.  I felt like I could have gotten a similar read from something titled, \\"You need a Guru to be cool and open minded like me\\"  I was really dissapointed in this book. On the one hand she portrays herself as humble, but then sneaks in comments suggesting that Christians and Muslims, and many others, have it all wrong, and only she and a handful of enlightened ones see things correctly.  I finished the book because a friend gave it to me to read, but I'm sorry I wasted my time.
0446577391|5.0|Protecting a con artist from vengeful casino king Jerry Bagger, Oliver Stone and his colleagues at the Camel Club find their efforts further challenged by a ruthless killer who targets Stone by threatening to reveal his mysterious past.<br /> I very much enjoyed the ride with this latest 'Camel Club' thriller. I would have to say it would be best if you read the previous novel, as i have, because it doesn't go into very much background. Overall a very satisfying novel that Baldacci fans will enjoy.
0765357151|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and was left hungering for more.<br /><br />The combination of PostApocalypse and Vampire genres is simply brilliant, and I am left hungering for a sequel or simply an expansion on the concepts explored in this short book.<br /><br />I could not put the book down, and read it in a single sitting.  I am looking forward to seeing the movie, but at the same time, and fearful.  I am fearful that the movie will scare the heck out of me, if it does a good job of bringing the book to life, and I am fearful of being dissapointed by a poor showing.<br /><br />Anyone who is into PostApocalypse and/or Vampire stories should consider this a must read.  It has inspired the likes of Stephen King.
0743298039|5.0|Reading a really good book feels a lot like connecting and conversing with a really good friend. One thing leads to another and words flow like a river carrying you away, through twists and turns, bringing you into and out of places you'd never thought you'd find yourself. Smiling, holding your breath, crying without realizing, you've been hypnotized by the landscape of someone else's story. Often, retracing your steps back to the beginning seems impossible since you've gotten \\"so far off track.\\" Maybe it takes getting so far off track to realize you don't really care about find your way back.<br /><br />Really good books, like really good friends, help loosen the grip of life. Really good things in this world bring us outside our perpetual thought machines and onto the fascinating result of someone else's.<br /><br />Such is the case with The Thirteenth Tale. First it's a story about a girl. Then it's a story about a famous author. Then it's a story about a famous author telling the most amazing stories to the world. It became to be for me, a story about family, life, books, writing, secrets, connections, family, family, family, fear, mystery and devotion.<br /><br />The plot twisted itself like a snake around my heart, and it wasn't long before I surrendered my attention and time to this great novel. In three days, I finished The Thirteenth Tale, and like real conversations with friends, I was sad when it was over. Nearly two weeks ago I bid adieu to Setterfield's beautiful characters (\\"cut your heart open and sew it back together again\\" beautiful), and they're still having conversations in my head. Like flashbacks from a good movie, her words are permanently etched in my mind.<br /><br />A ghost story, I was told. Twisted, one might say. You think you know something about someone in The Thirteenth Tale and then BAM! you're put in your place. The author may make you feel like the wide receiver for a couple of plays, but really, you're that guy in the stadium with the beer belly. It's someone else's story to tell, someone else's game. You may think you have it all figured out Magnum, but in the end, Setterfield shows you who's boss: The Storyteller. Which in itself, is testament to her literary brilliance.<br /><br />-land+sande's story to tell, someone else's game.

B000WS4PCO|4.0|It often seems to me that when an artist comes out with an album, it doesn't feel like it has the appeal it needs to make sure it comes from the heart. Although it is sad, but back in the 80's, there were many acts who've came out that have made some of the most definitive records that still stand today. Whether it is Michael Jackson's Thriller or Bruce Springsteen, music back then was really worth its merit. That also came from U2 dominantly. Their organic blend of Rock has kept Bono and company in the mainstream beyond their wildest dreams, and still shows that positive image in the way we hear their music today, and that can be said all over again with this landmark album.<br /><br />The 2007 re-release of U2's The Joshua Tree, brings back the classic sound from one of the most definitive records of all time. The album brought out the feeling of longing and meanings of souls to a whole vast world dealing with third-world life. The songs here sound better than ever and include the classic songs With Or Without You, the deep and delivering vibe of Where The Streets Have No Name, and the #1 hit I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.The album also includes extras including linear notes from Anton Corbin, who worked behind the scenes on this record, and brings back the feeling of distinctive Rock n' Roll. It is a great feeling when this classic album sees the light once again 20 years after it broke the ice on a whole new generation.<br /><br />While this past year, we've seen re-issued records from U.K. acts like Genesis and The Police, it is so easy to remeber how distince U2 brought the feeling back in the 80's, and The Joshua Tree sounds better than ever. If you haven't bought this record before, you really don't know what you're missing. I absolutely recommend this as a must for your music collection.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
B000WCBMA8|5.0|This is the most entertaining, best get up and dance album of the year.    All of the songs are great but the ones that stand out (for me):    Tick Tick Boom  Try It Again  You Dress up for Armageddon  Well Allright!  It Won't Be Long
B0000AXE8I|4.0|WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!<br /><br />Overall a good sequel. Just that it got away from the semi-gloomy theme of the first matrix and that turned me off a bit.<br />Nice allusion to some human fantasy characters and their purpose for existence in the 'matrix-world'.  Which is anachronistic being the the machines took over in the 21st century.<br />Put a dent in my expectations of Neo's possible rising omnipotence and his place as the singular 'hero' figure.<br />Gave Morpheus and Trinity a good test run of their skills against the agents.<br /><br />In itself a great movie, not as good IMHO as the original but a great movie for Matrix fans.

B00008YLV2|5.0|Only two movies steer you into ground zero combat, this movie and Saving  Private Ryan.  A great translation of the book Black Hawk Down, done by Ridley Scott.  This movie shows the sweat, blood, dust, clinging to a group of Rangers as they fight to survive in urban combat.  A regular group of grunts would have suffered much higher casualties on this Special Ops mission.  Early in the film, Ewan McGregor tells a young ranger (Orlando Bloom) reporting in, \\"Welcome to the Mog\\", short for   Mogadishu.        This is a visual trip into Mogadishu, Somalia.  You are surrounded by the eerie city with its' sights and sounds warning of trouble ahead for American forces.  This film digs in deep and shows the baptism under fire of a young soldier fighting off fear and panic.  (A normal process in battle)  Delta Force Sgts. thinking on the run to keep their men alive.        You feel and sense a mini \\"Alamo\\" taking place, when the men are surrounded in the city streets and cut off from chopper evacuation.  The courage and creed of the Rangers keeps them alive.  Your heart goes out to a medic who is working to save a rangers' life.  Blocking out the noise of gunfire, he works frantically to prevent shock and blood loss, trying to prevent death.  Different scenes portray the canvas of combat, showing how a prisoner snatch operation turns into chaos, planning goes out the window, and survival looks dim, tied up in politics and uncertainty.          The original book is read at West Point and studied by the next group of officers.  Regardless of politics, this is a salute to the Rangers and their creed-- \\"Leave no man behind\\".
031286504X|4.0|I really was rapt to this tale of Richard Neville, who apparently is the last of the human species left alive.  All other \\"people\\" have mutated into different degrees of vampires.  Neville locks himself in his house by night to avoid the gang of vampires led by his ex-neighbor.  By day he goes out looking to destroy sleeping vampires and getting supplies and studying (he is self-taught about blood disorders).  The story turns into a type of \\"Nazi-nightmare\\" (to explain this would be a spoiler).  My only complaint is that the story ends about midway through the book.  The rest of the book is a collection of Matheson's short stories.  When I was reading I was not aware that this was the case so I was very surprised when the tale ended.<br /><br />Some of the short stories are very good like The Prey which was later made into a scarry movie (Trilogy of Terror) where Karen Black was terrorized by a demon doll.  As good as some of these stories are, they are not as good as the I Am Legend main tale and that is why I only give this book four stars.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|from start to finish, united abominations is outstanding. it's without a doubt one of megadeth's finest records. i wasn't disappointed with a single track. the \\"new\\" a tout le monde isn't as good as the original, but it's a great song nonetheless. sleepwalker, the title track, gears of war and burnt ice in my opinion are right up there with megadeth's best. washington is next and never walk alone are 2 of the \\"catchiest\\" tracks on the album, and surprise surprise... both of 'em are singles. blessed are the dead and play for blood are both solid tracks, making united abominations megadeth's 2nd best album in my book. if you don't already own it, pick up a copy. you won't be disappointed.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|I liked most of this movie, especially the special effects, but the ending is too abrupt and the story is never resolved.  I like movies where the author tells you the ending.  It bothers me when I have to figure it out.<br /><br />Cage is ok in his role but not quite as good as he was in National Treasure.  His relationship with Jennifer Beals character seemed forced and not real.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is excellent as a Secret Service agent tying to enlist Cage's ability to see into the future so that she can prevent an atomic bomb from destroying Los Angeles.<br /><br />It could have been a lot better.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|I knew it was a CD I wanted. So the review is, well, I like it.
B000MGUZM0|3.0|To me this band--particularly on this album--owe most of their sound to Echo and the Bunnymen.  That's no bad thing but at times the tracks are eerily close to many on Porcupine and Ocean Rain.    Aside from that there are huge gobbets of Talking Heads in there as well.  Plus you get Neil Young influences, bits of The Residents, The Beach Boys, The Cardiacs, The Pixies and Luke Haines among loads of others.  It's a weird mix and it never quite gets clear of the records it keeps drawing from.    Still it's a good album but it isn't the saviour of contemporary music.  If it didn't sound so damn good it would be discarded as another pile of derivative rubbish.  What saves it is the brilliance of the playing and the complex arrangements. Shame it doesn't have much of an identity of its own, though.   Maybe the band will grow-up and get one.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Bought this for my youngest granddaughter, and she just loves it. She has watched it several times. Would recommend it to any young child.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Ever since getting \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" on DVD in college, I've been patiently waiting for \\"Help!\\" and what they say about what comes to those who wait is really true.    The DVD transfer is beautiful. All the colors pop out at you.  And the film is even funnier than I remember.  This would be great for any Beatles fan, especially young ones who have become recent fanatics.     Whether you buy the standard version or go all out for the $100+ package, you will not waste a penny on this rock and roll treasure.
B000SX88VW|5.0|Just adding my two cents and my 5 star rating.  This is my favorite album.  I had to buy the CD since i cant listen to my 78 in the car, and it probably stays in the CD player non stop.  Some complain the songs go on to long and don't have any singing...well... so what?  That adds to this album's greatness.  Its pure mellow Pink Floyd.
B00003CWRX|5.0|If `Gladiator' is responsible for introducing me to the one we know as Russell Crowe then `The Insider' is responsible for cementing in my psyche the fact that he is capable of just about anything (on screen that is).  `The Insider' is a far cry from `Gladiator', that's for sure, but Russell Crowe's performance is just as if not even more powerful than his Oscar winning portrayal of General Maximus.  `The Insider' is a dramatic look at the world of politics, in both that of big business and journalism and it does a fantastic job of establishing a view we all can share, letting each and every one of us see for ourselves the good, the bad and the ugly side of it all.  Michael Mann delivers an edge of your seat thriller that is not your conventional thriller.  I feel the need to say that because if you walk into this film expecting to see something flashy and, for lack of a better word, `commanding' (in a purely Hollywood, Blockbuster sense of the word) then you will be sorely disappointed.  If you walk into this film expecting to see a drama that will force you to think and comprehend what you are witnessing then by all means, sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />`The Insider' recounts the true story (at least for the most part it's true) of `60 Minutes' insider Jeffrey Wigand, a former tobacco executive who breaks his contractual agreements and feeds information, confidential information, to `60 Minutes' producer Lowell Bergman.  This causes major problems for Wigand and it affects him drastically, causing problems within his family, his marriage but also within the pit of his soul.  Wigand is tortured by his decisions for they present him a moral dilemma that he can't quite ascertain the correct answer to.  As Wigand struggles with his own demons Bergman becomes increasingly insistent and this presents Bergman with his own morality questions that he must decipher himself.<br /><br />Mann's direction creates a sense of tension, of uneasiness that manifests itself brilliantly within certain sequences of the film.  When Wigand is at the driving range for instance the viewer finds himself at the edge of his seat, hair standing on end, holding his breath until the scene is over and all is well.  Mann just has a masterful way of unnerving his audience, unraveling the surroundings of his film in such a way that we are left speechless (check out `Collateral' as well for the same effect).  The script, written by Mann and Eric Wroth (based on the article by Marie Brenner entitled `The Man Who Knew Too Much') also helps in this regard for it fleshes out the characters so well we become entangled in their plights and emotionally invest ourselves in their situation.<br /><br />The biggest asset to this film though is the incredible cast, Crowe especially (so I'll get to him last).  Al Pacino has faltered quite a bit in recent years, never really delivering quite like he used to, but here he manages to muster up his flare of yesteryear and deliver a top notch and commanding performance.  Christopher Plummer is also very well used as Mike Wallace.  His performance is very well grounded and memorable.  Diane Venora doesn't have a lot to do here but lend support to Crowe and she does a fine job at that.  Certain scenes really flesh out her performance, especially the scene when she finds a message on her computer.  Philip Baker Hall is always a delight to watch and his contribution to this film does not go unnoticed.<br /><br />That brings us to Crowe, an actor of whom I have no shame in admitting my unfailing devotion and utter admiration.  As Jeffrey Wigand, Crowe does what we look for in a performance...he loses himself in his character.  This is something I've always admired about Crowe's work but I don't feel that any performance of his to date comes close to the power behind that of Jeffrey Wigand.  This performance is probably my favorite interpretation of a real person in recent years, maybe ever.  What makes this such a commanding performance is that Crowe didn't have a gimmick to work with here; he just had a story to tell.  Jeffrey Wigand wasn't eccentric, he didn't have a disability...he was just an average person.  So what I mean to say here is that what Crowe did with Wigand is much more difficult that, say what Hoffman did with Truman Capote or what Jamie Foxx did with Ray Charles.  There is no `mimicry' here; there is no legend to channel.  This is just flawless acting.<br /><br />Crowe does so much acting with his face it becomes impossible not to get lost in his stare.  The ways his eyes seem to lose all their valiant energy expertly depict his almost hopeless state as the film progresses.  We can read every emotion, from confusion to fear, misery and dread to that devastating feeling of loss and regret that flood his eyes as he watches his world unwind.  I love Kevin Spacey, and I love his performance in `American Beauty' but there's no doubt in my mind that Russell Crowe gave the performance of the year in 1999.<br /><br />`The Insider' is a film that will mesmerize and entertain you, make you think and maybe even make you worry but in the end it will make you realize that not all decisions are easy ones to make and not all questions, especially of the moral kind, have a right or wrong answer.  Sometimes we are left to find our own `right' answer and just pray that it doesn't destroy us in the end.ce is that Crowe didn't have a gimmick to work with here; he just had a story to tell.

B000AP04KQ|2.0|First things first. Don't rent, (and certainly don't buy), this movie if you like your job. The humor will totally be lost on you. Second. There are probably better examples of the , \\"I hate my job\\", movie out there to be enjoyed. Take some time out of your boring day at work and find `em.     My wife got this for me because my job currently sucks BIG TIME so I got a vicarious thrill out of the conclusion. Even with that haze of sarcasm blurring my vision I must admit that the characters left me not really caring for ANY of them. They are rather cartoonish. Sorry Mike Judge, stick with the animation. It suits you better. The perplexing part of the plot is the main character's dream is to not have work, yet he keeps showing up there!!! It kind of makes you think this guy REALLY doesn't have a life beyond his dreary job. In other words, why would we care for a \\"hero\\" who is this much of a loser?!?!? This is where, for even the vicarious viewer, it gets stupid. If you hate your job, and don't want to go- (and the plot line says our man is hypnotized to be free of any employment worries)- why the heck do you keep coming back to this mundane garbage hole of place?!?!? I just want to smack this shmoe and tell him to actually start looking for a life.    If you really want the deeper meaning to this movie it's that in so many businesses it tanks. America won't be beaten from other countries' ingenuity but rather its own internal stupidity. If you give people their freedom and independence they cling to the safe, secure and complacent places they feel comfortable existing. Outwardly they revel in their fantasy of being cowboys roaming the range; tough-minded mavericks who can take on any challenge. But really, where is the true independent, self-reliant, rebel in this movie, (or today's world)? If this guy was from the America of old, he would have blazed new trails, explored new things or at least set an example of living his OWN life. Instead he haunts the boring existence he wishes to be free of!  Go figure?!?!?!? We are left with a movie that shows how many people are reflected: scared, child-like and needing a paternal figure to guide their lives. But, I diverse. The movie deserves, a barely there, two stars if you hate your job. Otherwise it goes home with a single star.
B00005K3OT|5.0|If ever there was a movie that was a delicious as its subject then `Chocolat' is that movie.  Making a movie about chocolate, the one guilty pleasure that transcends age, gender and race, is an idea in itself, but making that film creamy, sweet and pure is something all its own.  `Chocolat' tastes so incredibly sweet on the viewers palate, a film that coats our eyes with its rich goodness and makes us crave even more of what this beautiful film has to offer.<br /><br />Okay, enough with the obvious chocolate innuendoes.<br /><br />All kidding aside, `Chocolat' is a wonderful film, one that I never expected to like as much as I did.  My wife had seen the first part of this film some time ago and reported that it was horrible and thus she turned it off.  I must admit that the advertisements and posters for the film failed to draw me in (although after seeing the film and casting glance at the poster I can't see how Binoche's smile didn't draw me in at first glance) and so I accepted her complaint and tossed aside all aspirations of seeing the film even though my wife has significantly lower taste in film than I do and I generally reject any and all of her opinions on movies.  Now the other night, late at night I must add, this little film came on the food channel and I decided to watch it.  I only caught the first half hour before sleep overcame me but that first half hour was, in a word, spellbinding.  I insisted that my wife give it another try and so we rented to film the following day, and while she is not as intoxicated with this film as I am she readily admits that her initial response to this movie was wrong.<br /><br />The film centers around Vianne Rocher, a mysterious woman who moves to a reserved and very religious French town with her young daughter Anouk.  The town, about to observe Lent, immediately turn their backs to Vianne as she opens her chocolatier and tempts the townsfolk with all that they have vowed to abstain from.  No one opposes her more than the uptight mayor Comte Paul de Reynaud who comes to despise Vianne and everything she stands for.  He watches his power over the town slip from his grasp as they all begin consulting Vianne and falling prey so-to-speak to her chocolaty deliciousness.  Yes, Vianne is just as delectable as the chocolates she makes.  Her smile alone is intoxicating.<br /><br />The film is lovely to look for the cinematography is marvelous.  The acting is brilliant as well, from Binoche's devilishly sweet performance to Judi Dench's crotchety Armande Voizin to Alfred Molina's malicious Comte and Lena Olin's mysteriously beautiful Josephine.  Everyone involved here delves into their characters and delivers beautifully.  Johnny Depp has a very small role although it may seem from advertisements that his role would be larger.  He's effective but no where near as memorable as the remaining cast.  Carrie-Anne Moss delivers a nice little performance here as Armande's cold hearted daughter and young Victoire Thivisol manages to make Anouk a real girl, immature and foolish yet with a sense of maturity that would accompany her situation.<br /><br />I don't know if this would be constituted a spoiler, but I wanted to talk a bit about Pantoufle since I feel he is really the moral center of the film.  When the film opens we are introduced to Pantoufle, Anouk's imaginary friend kangaroo.  He is wounded and cannot leave her side.  At the end of the film Pantoufle is healed and bounces away from the town, and Anouk is happy for this.  Throughout the film mention is made of the fact Vianne moves around a lot and she even mentions herself that while she tells herself it's good for Anouk she knows in her heart that Anouk hates it.  To me Pantoufle was a metaphor for this very fact.  Anouk longed to stay put, thus the fact that Pantoufle could not leave her side.  He was wounded and thus could not travel.  She wished that she too could not travel but could experience some stability.  When she finally receives that stability at the films end she has no use for Pantoufle anymore for she has what she wants and so her subconscious sets him free.<br /><br />So, in the end I must say that I LOVED this movie, truly adored it.  It made me smile and rarely do films do that.  Maybe that's because I often seek out the film that depresses and saddens me because I enjoy the emotional connection to cinema, but it's nice to watch something that brings a smile and sense of joy to the soul, and `Chocolat' does just that.ceives that stability at the films end she has no use for Pantoufle anymore for she has what she wants and so her subconscious sets him free.<br /><br />So, in the end I must say that I LOVED this movie, truly adored it.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|I just saw the film for the second time -- on a flight from Phoenix to Chicago.  I rarely tune in to flight movies but I did enjoy this one so much the first time I saw it with my 12- and 14-year-olds, that I wondered if it still would appeal--and it did.  The flight monitor had a couple of reviewers talk about the film before it showed and one comment was that the audience might not be able to empathize with rats.  Well, I'm no fan of varmints and have re-located more than 135 squirrels that have robbed me of sleep at night, yet I totally loved seeing Remy the rat interacting with Linguini, the sad-sack wannabe cook.  It was, yes, as good as \\"Lady and the Tramp,\\" for animal/restaurant comparisons, and probably not as magnificent or classical as \\"Fantasia,\\" an all-time favorite, but definitely right up there with Pixar-Disney's \\"Incredibles.\\"
B00009NDB8|5.0|I had read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" before this book and loved it.  I had read that Sebold wrote \\"Lucky\\" in order to finish \\"LB\\" fully.  I picked up \\"Lucky\\" in Target one day just to read a few pages.  I read 15 pages and my stomach was almost sick.     I left the store, but kept thinking about the book.  I bought it within the week and then finished it.  I think the first half is among the most bracingly honest writing I have ever read.  I thought the ending cheats a bit (HOW did she become a heroin addict in NY?) by skipping around a bit, but it in no way reduces the impact of this book.  Painful to read, but impossible to put down.
1592332803|5.0|I can't really say much more about this incredible book that hasn't already been said. It is a beautifully done, wonderfully comprehensive guide to baking. While it is geared toward those who eschew animal ingredients, it is a valuable resource for anyone who bakes (and after reading the practical tips and informative inserts, more and more bakers will turn to this method of turning out delectable treats). The author graciously shares quite a lot of her knowledge, not only on veganism and animal rights, but also on baking techniques and tricks that will leave the reader wondering how they ever baked without this book! The Joy of Vegan Baking really takes the mystery out of animal free baking, and certainly makes it less intimidating for novice and adept bakers alike. You will probably find yourself looking for excuses and occasions to make all of the exquisite recipes provided in this book. Or you can always make some up! Have fun and enjoy!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Pixar does it yet again.  Can they do no wrong?  Great for kids and adults.
0743455967|5.0|A great \\"how-to\\" guide for any new writer. Also a candid and humble look at the writer's success, through his own words. You'll love it!
B0000CK3B4|1.0|This is the same book as Tether's End under a different name.  It is the most gruesome of Allingham's stories, and definitely not good as a first introduction to Allingham's Albert Campion and co.  Not at all light-hearted as some of her other works, such as Black Dudley or Mystery Mile, which I'd recommend if you are new to her detective fiction.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Finally we have an excellent DVD package for an excellent film. I won't go into the details of the film since the other reviews here have already done that but we finally have an appropriate release.     The first DVD release was lousy so I waited for a better release. I hate the two-sided disc so I'm glad they got rid of that. The first release was also a bare bones disc. This gives us not only a great transfer and a one-sided, attractive looking disc set but we get a commentary and a hour long documentary on the making of the film. It comes in an attractive case too.     All appropriate for one of the best films to come out of the 1980's! Well done!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I ordered the \\"Dexter\\" series out of pure curiosity. I've been hooked on the three CSI TV Series' for years. This TV series was a total shock! It was extremely graphic, and to say the themes are \\"dark\\" is like saying \\"TAR is a little gray\\". This show is so twisted & depraved...but, I couldn't stop watching: until the whole season was complete. It was total gore & shock for the first few episodes...but the characters and caliber of writing/acting were phenomenal! I was disgusted...but hooked! Looking into the lead character's mind was like looking into a dark and muddy pit...with deadly surprises waiting inside. All in all...a real shock, but a must for any serious mystery/CSI fan!
B000002JKA|5.0|Right from the get-go this album doesn't let up until \\"Silent Man.\\" Arguably, this is one of DT's heaviest productions. I have owned it for well over six years (hard to believe they've been around much longer than that!) and still find myself regularly pulling it out for a particular song but listening to the whole album. The guitar work is as usual, superb, but the rest of the music is also great. This is the album where DTs members' heavy metal influences show through. James Labrie is one of the greatest voices in music today. Without going into too much detail, I'd just say that this album is better than \\"Octavarium,\\" about as good as  \\"Images and Words,\\" or \\"Scenes from a Memory.\\" It's definitely one of DTs best efforts. In my opinion, this is a must-own DT album. I'd get rid of \\"Octavarium\\" or \\"Falling into Infinity\\" before I'd ever give this one away. For what it's worth, I don't own any of their albums after \\"Octavarium.\\"
B000VECAEO|5.0|Excellent Seinfeld DVD! Even if you aren't familiar with Seinfeld you can learn all about each actor and all they had to offer in making the show such a success. Highly recommended! VERY funny!
B000QQFKYE|2.0|More David Lynch dreamlike incomprehensibility, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Not everything, after all, has to be approached or understood on a rational, \\"mainstream narrative\\" basis.  But unlike Mr. Lynch's \\"Mulholland Drive\\", which had two beautiful actresses, occasional stretches of regular storytelling, and (let's be honest) generous amounts of firing-on-all-cylinders erotic content to make all the surrealism go down easier, \\"Inland Empire\\" offers only murky cinematography, dreary eastern European locales, and yet another repeat of that old Lynch stand-by, the ol' \\"one character all of a sudden becoming another character\\" thing.  And it's all wrapped in a whopping-long running time of two hours and fifty-nine minutes.<br /><br />The movie isn't worthless.  It's laced with intense acting, effective moments of creepiness, and the kind of weirdness only David Lynch could create (the sitcom rabbit people take the cake here on that score).  But, in the end, the movie is just too long and too dull, at least for my tastes.  I can take anything as long as it isn't boring, and alas, too many long stretches of \\"Inland Empire\\" are boring.<br /><br />The DVD is not un-generous, however.  Disc two redeems the proceedings a bit.  While the ample deleted scenes (\\"more things that happened\\") did nothing for me, I enjoyed the various features highlighting Mr. Lynch himself: he tells stories, runs around on the set of \\"Inland Empire\\" interacting with his cast and crew, and even shares with us a recipe for one of his favorite quick meals.  All fun, all engaging, and- most importantly- decidedly NOT boring.<br /><br />I'd give the DVD as a whole a \\"soft recommendation\\", but only if one has a, well... soft spot for David Lynch.  But the movie itself barely gets the two-star rating I selected.  I'll say it again: there's no worse sin in the world of arts & entertainment than being boring!
B000YPUF9W|2.0|i really liked the first resident evil and the second was ok, but not the worst movie i'd ever seen.  this one was worse than the second...but again, not the worst movie i've ever seen.  the action was really good and bloody, but the story was just terrible and the final fight was SUPER lame.  the only reason i didn't completely hate the film was that i saw it for free with a coupon that came with the resident evil two pack.  if i'd had to pay to see it, i would have been very upset.  however, like a sucker i will probably go to the theater to see the next installment, if it is ever made.  by the way, the worst movie ever is \\"the core\\"
0920668372|1.0|My wife and I both tried to read this book to our 9 month old.  The first time, when my wife read it, we both cried less than halfway through the book and couldn't finish it.  The second time, I wanted to see if I could make it through the book.  I made it further this time, but couldn't finish it either.  Good thing our 9 month old doesn't understand what we're reading aloud.<br /><br />Read the other 1-star reviews.  They're all pretty accurate.  I guess the 5-star reviews aren't wrong either, but do you really want to scar your child and yourself voluntarily?<br /><br />It's not a bad book, actually it's very touching.  But there are much better books to read to your child.<br /><br />Update:  You'd think that after 3 years, we'd be desensitized and would be able to read this book without crying.... nope.
B000G03Q2S|1.0|Get the 2001 PET SOUNDS CD with HDCD logo on back. It BLOWS AWAY the CD in this terrible reissue. It is a shame people ASSUME this later re-release surpasses the 2001 CD , as it is like night and day. The CD in this package is a DISGRACE.  Capitol Records should be ashamed putting out such a reduction in sound quality as an anniversary edition, when CLEARLY the 2001 CD in HDCD got it 'right'.  Since Capitol is STILL selling the awful Beatles CDs mastered OVER 20 years ago, it is NO surprise this issue is abysmal. Just more 'product',  the 2001 Pet Sounds CD is ASTONISHING by comparison.
B000BTJDG2|3.0|I'm usually wary about movies that trade on the Catholic Church's use of the exorcism ritual. It's a rare moviemaker who will pass up the chance to show compassion for victims or exploring the nature of evil than of exploiting dark supernatural forces for a big box office. TEER promised to take the phenomeenon of demonic possession seriously, but fell into using overworn cliches and plot devices.<br /><br />TEER purports to be based on the story of a young woman who supposedly died in the midst of an exorcism. A young woman goes off to college, and soon starts seeing and hearing scary things. She is found in odd, rigid, almost impossible postures. Her condition is not relieved by medical doctors, so her parents bring in their local parish priest, who attempts to drive out demons that he believes are possessing her. When she dies (this is no spoiler, as it happens in the first minutes of the film) the priest reponsible is charged with reckless homicide.<br /><br />The film is laid out as a combination horror flick and courtroom drama, with flashbacks between legal events of the present with dramatized scenes of the past. Laura Linney, as the agnostic defense counsel Erin Bruner, does a fine job as a straightlaced and hardworking attorney moving up in her legal firm. Jennifer Carpenter  is extraordinary as the possessed girl. She has such incredible control of her facial features that it's hard to tell where she leaves off and the special effects group steps in. Tom Wilkinson as Father Richard Moore is quite convincing as the humble man of God determined to get Emily Rose's story out in court.<br /><br />It seemed at first that Director Scott Derrickson was trying to film an exocism movie that could be read from a naturalistic point of view as well as a supernatural one. If so, he was gradually overwhelmed by the gravitational pull of cinematic conventions that are trotted out when the Devil makes an appearance. There are scary frosty window panes, people whose eyes go black, morphing paintings and frightening nighttime visitations. The victim, portrayed as completely normal and innocent (a farm girl, even!) is suddenly making weird inhuman vocalizations, injuring herself, frightening animals and running around in the rain in her nightgown. Have we seen this before? But is the girl crazy, or possessed? The film destroys the mystery by having various characters tormented in a peculiar, signature manner. Would the real Devil be as transparent about leaving clues as the Riddler in the Batman series? More damning (!) is the way the film cynically twists the true story of Anneliese Michel, upon which the film was supposedly based. Look it up for yourselves.<br /><br />TEER introduces a few unwelcome twists to the genre. That being medicated interferes with exorcism was bothersome from a theological point of view. Either the name of Jesus expels demons or it does not. And the weird \\"deus ex machina\\" denouement seemed tacked on and unconvincing. If you need to suddenly inject a heavenly visitor into the script to give your film credence, you're in trouble. The courtroom theatrics and the final verdict were also unconvincing. I had a hard time believing such nonsense would be permitted in a US court of law. And instead of telling me that Emily Rose's grave was a pilgrimage spot, couldn''t you show me a few dropping by?<br /><br />This is the rare DVD in which the extras actually dimish the film. Learning that some scenes were shot with a full-scale anatomical model did not impress me. The interview material with director Derrickson was banal and pompous -- I don't believe for an instant that he read 2000 books about demonic possession. The interview with the set designers was interesting, though. The movie has an odd, gray/blue washed out palette that they worked hard to create and maintain.<br /><br />Whether intended to play against the genre or, in spite of some fine performances and a few scary jump scenes, The Exorcism of Emily Rose was just another tired old devil flick.
B000TUXL2A|4.0|Very good guitar work and good songs, as you would expect. If you're expecting Dire Straits' rockers, this album might be too laid back for you.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I may not be the best person to review Hairspray, because when I see a movie with people singing and dancing I like it, unless it is just dreadful. So now you know my pro-musical prejudice, but I think Hairspray is just wonderful. I have seen the original John Waters non-musical DVD, the stage play and now the movie musical, and I love all three. The cast in this wdescreen edition is uniformly terrific, the music is broadway-style great, and the production makes me want to jump up and dance and sing. If you are like an acquaintance of mine who thinks it is dumb for people to sing to each other, you probably won't like Hairspray. But if you, like me, wish the world were more like musical theater, Hairspray will be at the top of your love-it list.
B000069HJL|4.0|Paris is a very unique and special live album of one of the great bands of late seventies and eighties. The combination of Rick Davies and Roger Hudson deliveres that special Supertramp sound, which was already unique on the studio albums.  This live albums contains the successes on the first CD and has some of the best and most beautiful songs of Supertramp on the second CD.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|First, I love Bruce...since way back. I think this CD is an artistic triumph. Beautiful lyrics and music. Hats off to the Boss. HOWEVER (and this is a big however) I can't figure out why the production is so bad. Fuzzy, not at all clean and clear and crisp. I would not have been able to make the lyrics without the insert! WHAT HAPPENED?? I declare, my original LP of BORN TO RUN bought at WT Grants back in the day sounds clearer than this? Bruce, you've got pots of money. Clean this up and re-issue to all of the people who bought it.
B000002GQH|5.0|[[ASIN:B000002GQH On the Threshold of a Dream]]<br />It was a great album and it's a great CD!
B000ZBEOF6|5.0|[[ASIN:B000ZBEOF6 Across the Universe]]         Having seen the movie 5 times does not make me an expert, nor does being a Beatles fan for 45 years but I have to say this movie is better than I'd hoped it'd be.  If you go by the critics reviews you probably wouldn't go see it, but if you trust your own instincts, love a good musical, great acting, Beatles music and some visuals best described as a mild acid trip, then this is the movie for you.  I'd classify it in the same genre as The Who's rock opera \\"Tommy\\" and even though it's not the Beatles performing the songs (kinda hard when there are only 2 of them left) the actors and on occasion musicians who sing the songs do an outstanding job.  Some of the songs are changed slightly to keep more in tune with the movie, but there's not a one that won't get stuck in your head.  Naturally I rushed straight to my nearest CD store right after I saw the movie the first time and bought the deluxe edition.  Now while I wait for the DVD to be released I can listen to it and relive the movie in my mind.  I think I'd better get 2 copies of the DVD because I'm sure I will wear out one.  And since the movie is no longer in the theaters, the only way to get to see it now is to buy it once it's available.  Reserve yourself a copy now....you won't be sorry
B000001G5A|5.0|I've got CD's of several productions of this work in my CD library, and have listened to a few more.  To my way of thinking this is THE Mozart Requiem recording to have.  In the Offertorium \\"Domine Jesu Christe\\" the fugue is taken at a perfect pace to assure that the listener will be acutely aware of each of the plethora of minor suspensions Mozart wrote until the glorious resolution in the final Picardy 3rd with pipe organ blazing.
B000E33VWW|2.0|I have to say I really didn't enjoy this film. It was a dark, depressing film that portrayed the sympathetic relationshiop between Truman Capote and several men who brutally  murdered a family. I didn't get it. Was that supposed to be interesting? Well, it wasn't to me. Also,while I admire Philip Seymour Hoffman, I don't think his portrayal of Capote was effective enough to overcome the ick factor of his near romantic relationship with a murderer. I prefer enjoyable films, but hey, thats just me.
B00005JMJG|1.0|A film with utterly no pulse. It was impossible for me to get engrossed in a plot inhabited by unlikable self-absorbed slackers and drifters who dwelled on and perpetuated their own misery.    After watching 20 minutes of Carrey feeling sorry for himself and Winslet behaving like a patient on a day's pass from the ward, I turned it off. I'm glad I did.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I think that Season 3 is at least the equal of the first two, as the mysteries are more substantial and the overall tone is darker, but the great comedic dialogue remains.  The extras include a 15 minute portion of what would be a Season 4 episode, and much commentary by Rob Thomas on highlights and deleted scenes
0743298039|5.0|What a wonderful and imaginative book!  This is a story for true bibliophiles!  All the characters are fully rounded and easy to relate to.  Being an expat of England for some twenty odd years now, this book made me homesick and longing to be friends with Margaret Lea (yes, I know, she's a fictional character).  Just when you think you've figured out what's what, you get thrown once again!  There is a part in the book where Vida Winter asks Margaret Lea to imagine all of her favourite books being put on a conveyor belt leading to a fire.  She has a gun in one hand and a choice to spare the man's life who is about to feed the fire with her beloved books, or shoot him to save the books.  Which does she choose?  I'm not telling, you'll have to read the book.<br /><br />A voracious reader, I can finish quite a few books within a month.  This is one of the best books I've read in years!  No exaggeration!<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and get this book!

B0000542DJ|5.0|`Oliver Stone's best filmed historical novel sees Costner bringing the overly aggressive Jim Garrison into the Kennedy assassination plot as a major player, years after his sun had set  nationally. In a highly realistic tale, Garrison and wife Spacek weave an intriguing story of mafia-Cuban relations, which many today still believe to be true. Fortunately, the book \\"Best Evidence\\", followed by modern forensics seem to have cooled down the hysteria concerning gunman Oswald's need of an accomplice. Meanwhile, even the bit players including Sutherland talking in his eerie manner on a park bench, deliver top rate performances. One has to alert the public however that this film is historical fiction on the screen, not pure history. President Ford went to his grave believing that Oswald had acted alone in Dallas as a \\"nut\\",with absolutely no Cuban backing.It's a great movie, just be careful of your objectivity.
0316067598|5.0|This is a difficult review to write. My boyhood home town is Patchogue, New York. It is also SEAL Michael Murphy's. Admiration of our Spec warriors gives me pride, inspiration and hope. I was at the federal building dedication for, Medal of Honor Recipient, Michael Murphy. I only wish I had known him.     Due to the nature of special operations, knowledge of missions is typically classified. Discussion of them is usually frowned upon. One person accounts are subjective. That does not make them unbelievable, however incredible. I have found no official military endorsements of Lone Survivor nor have I seen condemnation or official doubt. In fact, following official review, Marcus Luttrell was awarded a Navy Cross and a purple heart, as were Navy SEALS Axelson and Dietz.    This is a gut wrenching book. It is necessary to slog through the early chapters of personal background and BUD/S training to have a window into the character, determination and unfoundering dedication of SOF Navy SEAL frogs. Marcus was one of the SEALs in Dick Couch's book, Warrior Elite, BUD/S Class 228.    Marcus Luttrell's raw remarks about liberal media bias are sure to inflame some. Just check the negative, doubting, reviews questioning the accuracy of his story. However, I do trust the integrity of the after action commendations to SEAL Luttrell and the team.    I believe this book should be read by all Americans, including those who need a reaffirmation of what is at stake. This is mortal combat against a deceptive, cunning and ruthless enemy. Our military needs to know we have their backs, at home. It is imperative that those who represent our citizenry provide our warriors with proper attention to detail of rules of engagement, materiel, training, planning, battle field support, cohesiveness of purpose. We must press the fight on all levels. As Robert Jervis states in his book System Effects, \\"One can never do just one thing\\".     Read the book,  thoughtfully reflect on it. Make your ownjudgement of heroism and how you will honor the fallen.

B000JLTRKE|5.0|In 2006, acclaimed director Paul Greengrass (\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\") delivered to audiences a powerful look at what may have transpired aboard United Airlines flight 93 on that dark day in September in his docu-drama \\"United 93\\". That same year, the highly controversial, yet popular director Oliver Stone (\\"Alexander\\") brought his view to the events of that day by chronicling some of the rescue efforts taking place at Ground Zero in the equally powerful and moving \\"World Trade Center\\" starring Nicolas Cage (\\"Ghost Rider\\"), Maria Bello (\\"A History of Violence\\"), and Michael Pena (\\"Shooter\\").    \\"World Trade Center\\" begins on the morning of September 11th, 2001 and continues on into that evening, chronicling the horrifying hours spent buried beneath the rubble of Towers 1 and 2 by survivors numbers 18 and 19, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena). As the minutes stretch into hours, John and Will struggle to keep each other awake and to not lose hope that they will soon be rescued, while back at home their loving wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhall) cling to their family members and try to remain optimistic and strong, holding on to the hope that they will once again be reunited with their husbands.    When it was announced that the events of September 11th were going to be captured on film by both \\"United 93\\" and \\"World Trade Center\\", some felt that it was too soon, or that the films would in some way exploit that day, disrespecting all who lost their lives that day and the heroes who tried to save them. For \\"United 93\\" that was pretty much where the criticism ended, but for \\"World Trade Center\\" another concern was that its director, Oliver Stone, would use his film as just another vehicle for his conspiracy theories as he had done before in the films \\"JFK\\" and \\"Born on the Fourth of July\\". However, when both films were released to theaters all of the concerns regarding the content were quickly silenced. Both films showcased the utmost respect for those who were victims of that day whether they be those on the planes, or trapped in the rubble beneath the buildings, or the families left behind, all were honored and never once exploited.    For those of us that were pleased by the outcome of Oliver's effort, there were some people that were disappointed in him for not presenting a more controversial viewpoint in \\"World Trade Center\\", feeling that by choosing to make a more balanced and accurate account of that day, he had somehow sold out. I for one was proud of Oliver Stone for making, what is for him a brave decision, to set aside his penchant for controversy, and make the best movie he could make to accurately depict what these people went through and to honor their sacrifice. Bravo, Mr. Stone. You've now come one step closer to realizing that there's not always a covered-up conspiracy behind every major event in human history, and that you don't have to use controversy to make a great film.    The performances in \\"World Trade Center\\" were excellent all across the board. The most impressive performances were those of Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena, who for about 90% of the movie were buried beneath dirt, and realistic looking rubble with essentially only their faces in plain view. For an actor to not be able to make gestures of any kind while talking must be a very difficult test of their ability, I mean even everyday people rely heavily on their hands to get their points across in any given conversation (even when on the phone), so for an actor to be forced to only rely on their facial expressions to convey their feelings and actually succeed in doing so is a huge testament to their talent. The supporting cast led by Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhall were equally strong, and consisted of some of the most emotional aspects of the movie, as the wives focus inward to cope with the fear of losing their husbands, while on the outside remaining strong for their children and/or relatives. Rounding out the cast were two highly capable actors, Stephen Dorff (\\"Blade\\") and Michael Shannon (\\"Bug\\"), who portrayed two of the most pivotal people in regards to John and Will's rescue, the lead rescuer Scott Strauss and the marine who discovered their location, Dave Karnes. Though their roles were essentially cameo appearances, both men delivered very strong, believable performances; and for Stephen Dorff, it was possibly one of the best roles I had seen him in to date.     Earlier, I stated that all concerns regarding the two films were silenced upon their release (especially those regarding \\"World Trade Center\\"), this is true for most of the concerns, all except for one. The concern of some that it was just too soon was a concern that still remained even after the release, and for some it will never cease to be too soon. But for everyone else, \\"World Trade Center\\" is a film that should be watched, as it is an incredibly moving piece of cinema that celebrates everything that is great about the American spirit; our courage, compassion, self-sacrifice, inability to give up, and above all, our hope.    \\"World Trade Center\\" is rated PG-13 for language and disturbing images.

0316096199|4.0|During a speech in my English class, I said that I am inspired by honesty. It is a trait that is dripping with authenticity, a characteristic not upheld at all times, but one that holds my utmost respect.  I started reading Alice Sebold's book, Lucky, only knowing that it was an account of a girls' rape.  Alice begins her memoir with, \\"This is what I remember,\\" almost as if asked a question of her childhood that she would reiterate fondly.  And then she continues.  Chapter after chapter flew by while reading Alice's graphic account of being raped, but after walking away from each sitting I went straight to my own memoir in progress, inspired to be utterly and painfully as honest as possible in my reflections.  Alice challenged me to write what was in my heart, and nothing less.  I was to relay my story in choice words, not cheating a reader out of what truly transpired, thereby offering the possibility of healing through my words.      Alice's writing style reminds me of a friend in my current English class: a style that flows with memories and feeling, accurate and perfect words describing scenes and memories.  Her descriptions are endless, creating a scene that played itself out in my mind so well that I had a hard time remembering whether I had just woken up from a horrific and awfully factual dream...or if I was reading a memoir after all.    Alice is clear to declare that what transpired is what it should be called by name: rape.  This is what happened, no beating around the bush.  Due to her perseverance through this case, Alice's tragedy went to trial.  Alice upholds Gail Uebelgoer's (her lawyer) opinion very highly, as Gail was succinct and to the point with facts from her rape, and endorsed certain expectations of Alice that Alice loved living up to, doing so quite naturally.  This case was making Alice a stronger individual, to say the least.  Gail \\"was there to do a job.  She wanted what I wanted: to win.\\"  Complete with an \\"arresting\\" smile, Ms. Uebelgoer \\"got involved,\\" establishing and eventually strengthening a bond between Alice and herself that would last during, and even after, every postponed court date.      Gail was present when Alice's family did not know how to react, when they were unsure of even how to come to terms with the gross reality thrust upon them.  It is always admirable to see genuine portrayal of family life.  I have heard it said from a friend that she would \\"burn the truthful account of my family before letting them see it,\\" complete with memoir in hand.  At first, I would have concurred.  But after reading how Alice reiterates quite profoundly her family's reaction(s) and supposed support--albeit inevitably at times--I encouraged her to not be fearful of sharing her true understanding of her family's actions...and reactions.  This is obviously easier for me to say than actually accomplish.  My accounts in my memoir and other writings are certainly heartfelt and...well, frank...and I can hardly bring my own class to peer evaluate, much less the ones actually involved in my story.  My family.    I applaud Alice's ability to level with her audience, and relay events occurring with her family as genuinely as her accounts of her past.  Be forewarned of the detail into which Alice goes; I even had to close my eyes for one moment, and wait to continue to read as she was detailing her account of rape until a wave of nausea passed.  I have never read of violence to this degree, but could barely tear my eyes away.      I was disappointed with how candidly sex was offered as something to cross off of an imaginary list.  It was something to aspire to and accomplish, so much so that the ending was just that: her last sexual encounter.  I understand and can appreciate the break-through or preconceived level Alice rose to, especially due to the point of this memoir, Lucky...the point being that it was her first \\"normal\\" sexual experience after her rape, but not the first time she slept with someone after being raped.  Yes, this is significant; it is almost as if she is free again.  Alice even compares this experience to being a virgin, and having sex for the first time: \\"The sex that night was short, fumbling.\\"  Her partner even agreed, saying, \\"It was almost virginal, like you were having sex for the first time.\\"  I was just disappointed with how sex seemed to be viewed with such irreverence.      If you are struggling with how \\"fake\\" people portray themselves today in literature, (and are up for a very real and visual account of violence), I recommend this book. It was difficult, and at times chilling to read, but worth every single word.
B0001L3LUE|1.0|Ah yes, the man is a gentleman and a scholar! A fine liver-spotted trophy of yester-year's own flippant little charades. Manipulated events wherein, just as today, soulless geeks get to vent their revenge on the world and the bullying grunts who inhabit it by directing the blind, head-on fate of thousands and millions of hapless souls who, through no real fault of their own, have gotten in the way of the Gameplan, or were severely influenced by the way the big Game is played.<br /><br />As I stared into the black, beady eyes of an old and withered Robert Strange McNamara (yes, that's his real middle name) during the viewing of \\"The Fog of War\\", it occurred to me that perhaps no man, living or dead, has forcibly lied to himself as convincingly and consistently, (esp. with such grave reprocussions concerning the fate of mankind) as has this horrible beast. Notice the certain joy and flippancy in his voice when he chirps and ribbets about the way he played the game when it was his turn at the table!<br /><br /> O, undoubtedly there have been fouler birds (but certainly not many) which have spread their wings to block out the sun, but could any of them have been more convinced that they were endeavoring to do right before God and man?<br /><br />One cannot help but note the bitter irony, as we listen to Bob rattle on remorselessly about his role in the fire-bombing of Tokyo at the end of WWII, which killed over 100,000 civilians, then get all choked up and teary-eyed about how he was the one to pick out the plot location for the final resting place of his goodbuddy Jack, during that fateful November of '63.<br /><br />Obviously a walking dichotomy, a Type-A case study for the division of mind and spirit, ol' Bob counterdicts and implicates himself with reckless abandon over the course of this film.<br /><br />A choice quote straight from his thin, bloodless lips, \\"Whenever I am asked a question I don't want to answer, I reply with the answer to the question I wish I was asked. This is a rule which has served me well.\\" Woo-eee! Obviously the model for all our current political hacks.<br /><br />His calloused appraisals of the unnecessary casualties suffered from his many executive blunders, and of those around him, as being a worthwhile price to pay to achieve their noble aims, is fine insight into the mind of the tyrannical warmongers which have controlled the fate of mankind since our supposed \\"civilization\\".<br /><br />While listening to some of the snickering tales he recounts of the wretched General LeMay, in which McNamara makes botched attempts at infusing elements of wit and humor into the scenarios, I once again realized how out of touch with humanity our \\"leaders\\" trully are. They obviously view themselves as some sort of superior life form, which is perhaps, simply just the type of egotistical scum such positions of power inevitably attract.<br /><br />Without coming straight out and saying \\"It was me! I am the horrible mutant to blame for these attrocities!\\" McNamartyr implies his guilt concerning the unforgivable fire-bombings of some 27 major Japanese cities BEFORE the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These are details I feel gipped at never having been exposed to in American History 101. Having obliterated so much of that country's infrastructure and wiped out half of its' population, one can't help but wonder, \\"Were the A-bombs necessary for Japan's surrender?!\\" The answer of course is \\"Hells no!\\" It was simply another test of our nuclear capability, which a few crusties at the Pentagon, and their handlers, deemed necessary.<br />Next Bob dances like a woodland fairy around the Bay of Pigs and the Gulf of Tonkin debacles, before settling for a slight bit of self-implication, while pinning ultimate resposibility on the Commanders in Chief. (Which is fair enough, but does little to cleanse his own blood-stained hands.)<br /><br />I would suggest any who view this movie to go to the special features and check out all the additional footage. It really adds to the film and further exposes McNamartyr as being far from reformed, still as wily and dangerous a monster in old age as he was in youth. (One can only surmise that it was his enormous ego and craving for one last bask in the limelight which coaxed him from the shadows to devulge such a lurid tale.) The extra footage also shows how he is still covering for the \\"secret\\" world government which has us all in bondage; his tight lipped responses to a few key questions definitely prove him to be a loyalist, capable of taking their secrets to his grave. (Research the board members of the World Bank and the Council of Foreign Relations if you care to know who is really in charge. Are we to think that Bob's appointment to head the World Bank after his dismissal as Secretary of Defense, is pure coincidence? Sheesh. How stupid do we look?)<br /><br />All in all, a very enlightening and thought-provoking documentary, which allows you to draw your own conclusions, while giving you enough info to discern it correctly. If you pay careful attention and can read between the lines at times, Bob does a fine job of exposing some of the behind-the-scenes developements and plot twists which show how the system operates and how we got to where we are at in current world affairs.<br /><br />This film loses four stars from me on account of the glaring omission concerning any discussion with ol' Bob on the subject of the vile and traiterous sinking of the USS Liberty by the Israeli military off the Sinai Peninsula June 8, 1967 during the \\"Six Day War\\" between Israel and the Arab states of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq. This attack killed 34 U.S. servicemen and wounded at least 173.<br />Multiple inquiries by both sides into the incident concluded that it had been simply a mistake of identity.<br /><br />If you can call several hours of continuous strafing by fighter planes and a full-on assault by torpedo boats, an \\"accident\\".<br /><br />Some still cling to this belief in hopes that our government is being run by hapless fools, oblivious to the reprocussions of their actions. (It sure appears that way if you yourself are oblivious to their master plan.)<br /><br />But all the signs show them to be most cunning devils, devious to the enth degree, quite content to bathe in whatever amount of blood necessary to achieve their goal of world domination and enslavement.<br /><br />So, I snatch back four stars for both that omission and Mr. Morris' over-all failure to hold ol' B Mac's toes to the flame in regards to his most obvious attrocities.<br /><br />Still, I would highly recommend this as a must-see film.<br />P.S. On a side note; didn't Rumsfeld, with all his forked-tongue deceit, seem like ol' Bob's political re-incarnation? Even down to the way he was dismissed after serving his purpose.

B000VNMMWA|5.0|I bought the original DVD, and thought the extras were fine, but I knew I had to buy this release, and it doesn't disappoint.    I haven't finished watching all the extras, but I'd say the purchase was worth it for \\"Dead Right\\" alone. It's on of Edgar Wright's home movies from his high school days, and it's hilariously bad in the best ways.     The commentary, from what I've seen, is also great. Lots of deadpan comedic jewels.    Finally, the DVD case design is innovative and snazzy.
B000BRBA8S|3.0|The story line is incoherent futuristic surrealistic-abstract, while future, present, and past are  co-relating to Tony's affairs.<br />To understand this movie better, it'd be better to read symbols instead of picking up the time and the space; and to name a few:<br />* A train of time and memories connects the stories of his encounters.<br />* The android represents one of his encounters, Faye, and himself as Faye's Japanese boyfriend.<br />* Different (speaking) dialects between he and each encounter foreshadow a unrequited relationship.<br /><br />Besides playing the elements of a movie and giving an ostensible beautiful incoherent directing, the story and the movie lack an extension and expansion of the protagonist's passion while interacting with other (over-acting) actresses.<br />I give this movie 2.46 points.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is a MUST for anyone who has a HD-DVD player.  Not only is this one of the best documentaries about our planet but the hi-def picture is astounding!  The BBC never ceases to amaze me with the quality of it's programs!!!
B000059GEI|5.0|I love musicals and this one has been a favorite since it first came out in 1954.  I was thrilled to receive the DVD and even more thrilled to find that the songs and dances were still as wonderful as I remembered, the production numbers still as splendid, and the total show as remarkable as ever.<br /><br />Dan Dailey and Ethel Merman are Terry and Molly Donahue, vaudeville performers circa 1919 when the movie opens.  They quickly add children Steve (Johnnie Ray) Katy (Mitzi Gaynor) and Tim (Donald O'Connor) to the act as each child is old enough to wobble on stage.  They become the successful act known as The Five Donahues and tour constantly even as vaudeville dies away.  When their paths cross with an ambitious blonde named Vicky (Marilyn Monroe) things are never the same.  She breaks Tim's heart and he spirals downward into an alcoholic haze, son Steve leaves the act when he decides to become a priest, and Broadway replaces vaudeville as the elder Donahues spend less time on stage and more time in their New Jersey home.  The ending always leaves me dissolved in tears, but it is the lavish production numbers that make this a favorite.  From the catchy opening of Merman and Dailey performing \\"When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam'\\" (later reprised by Gaynor and O'Connor) to the lavish staging of \\"Alexander's Ragtime Band\\" and the uplifting closing of the title song, this movie is a feast for fans of music and dance. Even though Marilyn Monroe shines in her sexy \\"Heat Wave\\" number, the long-legged Dailey makes dancing an effortless joy throughout and Merman's voice is uncommonly rich, it is Donald O'Connor and Mitzi Gaynor who enthusiastically dance their way into your heart and steal every scene they are in.
0393320928|4.0|In this sequel to \\"surely you must be joking Mr. Feynman,\\" Richard Feynman once again uses his cunningness and his scientific genius to entertain. This book starts off with a brief history of him and his scientific career. Then it goes on to his wife's death. This is a very sad excerpt of the story and in this part, he communicates with you the sorrow he goes through, showing he does truly love his wife. During this portion you realize that although he is a brilliant man and is nearly untouchable in the scientific realm, he is still down to earth and goes through every thing that we do. Also in this book is the main feature, the Challenger investigation. The Challenger exploded shortly after leaving the ground and NASA wanted to know why. They pull in a group of the top scientists, mathematicians and some other random people that don't have names. Their job is to see what went wrong with the Challenger in an effort to stop this mistake from being repeated. Feynman and the others work in Washington D.C. over six months. He finally figured out and proved, with simply a glass of ice water and a part off of the Challenger, what the problem was. He used his ingenious brain and his sense of humor to establish his point and to show NASA their miniscule piece that was causing such a major problem. This book is incredibly funny and is not such a book that has large vocabulary and crazy concepts never heard by normal human ears. It is an easy read and a fun read.

1881273156|4.0|The idea of the love tank, I give a 5 star!  I only gave the book a 4 star though because- of how it is written.-  Some chapters I think should have been addressed before the Love Language chapters.  As well the idea of the \\"in love\\" syndrome it talks about- I think isn't always right.  Sometimes two people really are ment for eachother. - God has a purpose for them to be together.-  Maybe these are two different things completely. -I still think it needs to address those that did not have the \\"in-love\\" phase. They just knew they should be together.  You can really stretch the ideas of the Love tank though, with any relationship!  An awesome book for Both partners to read- but is worth reading alone as well!
0743201140|5.0|\\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" is a breath of fresh air. I can relate, as authors Marcus Buckingham & Donald O. Clifton describe in their book, to people who tend to focus on their weaknesses instead of identifying their talents and building them into strengths.  Before reading this book, I used to focus on everything that I thought needed improvement instead of seeing that there were natural areas in my workplace that I excelled in.  I am a loan servicer at an investment bank, and I have discovered that I am currently performing in a job that capitalizes on my strengths and my talents.  My knack for organization and discipline has earned me the role of training new hires in my department.  Without recognizing this talent, I may have turned down the opportunity when my supervisor suggested that I take on this responsibility.  I really enjoy my work.<br /><br />I've also found satisfaction with my workplace from reading books by authors Ariel & Shya Kane.  Before reading their book, [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]], I would complain about my job, thinking that it was just a job that paid the bills, always dreading 9:00AM on Mondays and day dreaming about 5:00PM on Fridays. My existence at my workplace was so unsatisfying that I was miserable.  After reading their books, including [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]] and [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]], I have discovered that if I fully engage in the moment with my life, the mundane tasks in life become magical.  Magical - as in fun, easy, and satisfying.  Not only have I found that I have unique strengths by reading \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\", I have found a life of ease in my workplace, by reading the award winning books by Ariel & Shya Kane.
0962477060|4.0|If you're stuggling to piece together advanced chord forms and lead positions, this book may help you reach that \\"a-ha!\\" moment when things fall into place. It's not for everyone. It's entirely theoretical (no applications/exercises), dense, and bone-dry. Kinda like a calculus book for those studying music theory on guitar. And it really needs a copy editor. But the insights have helped me a bit.
0807014273|5.0|This is a small book with a big subject - life and meaning - written in 1946 and first published in 1959. Only recently it has been published in English. It still rings true, written by a Nazi concentration camp inmate, Dr. Viktor Frankl. He originally wanted to be an anonymous author; however, his friends persuaded him to publish under his own name to give the book credibility. Readers could therefore also understand this is a psychiatrist's objective view of suffering, which is part of life, and why life and hope prevail in the darkest moments.<br /><br />Part One, Experiences in a Concentration Camp is key to all he learned on the meaning of life. The horrible losses and inhumanity are seared into your mind, but when Dr. Frankl looks at the horror with educated eyes, he recognizes courage, objectivity and responsibility as vital for survival. This is a story of a man who was sent to the concentration camp with a belief that if he had to suffer and die, it would be significant: he would not suffer nor die for nothing.<br /><br />Dr. Frankl reviews the fight for survival and his decisions that somehow help him survive. He notes that prisoners go through three phases, 1)shock: the period following his admission 2)apathy: the period where they they become well entrenched in camp routine, and 3)the sense of loss, where they lose everything but hope. He digs down deep in his own soul to helps others to go on and have meaning in their life - not to give up and find the basic motivation to go on. He teaches despairing men \\"that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but what life expected from us.\\" Dr. Frankl repeats, \\"if we have the \\"why\\" we will always find the \\"how\\" to go on.\\"<br /><br />This book shows each individual he is important and every decision he makes is impactful. Therefore, make the right decisions and be triumphant. Right decisions cause the least pain and give the most love for fellow man. It is what gives us hope and value as part of humanity.<br /><br />Part Two, Logo-Therapy in a Nutshell, was not as interesting to me. It describes Frankl's philosophy of logo-therapy and reminded me of of mid-eastern religions as well as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It is a way (Frankl calls it \\"neo-dynamics\\") to have a goal in mind and achieve it no matter what obstacles and stress you are facing. The things that make life important and with meaning are different for each of us. All of us can have a meaning of life, but the \\"big picture meaning\\" is hard to understand. It takes us a lifetime of good and bad events and decisions to shape us.<br /><br />Part Three, is a postscript on \\"Tragic Optimism\\" and states that despite the \\"tragic triad\\" (as it is called in Logo-Therapy) 1)pain, 2)guilt, and 3)death - how is it possible to say yes to life in spite of all that? Logo-therapy teaches there are three main avenues on which one arrives at meaning in life. The first is creating a work or by doing a deed. The second is by experiencing something or encountering someone, and the third is turning a personal tragedy into a triumph. He mentions using bad situations as a growth experience.<br /><br />Overall a deep book but a good book on looking at life. It shows that each one of us can determine personal meaning and why it is important.ogo-Therapy in a Nutshell, was not as interesting to me.

0375423966|5.0|In Persepolis, Marjane Satrapi tells a story in words and pictures of her life in Iran.  The first book covers Satrapi's life from early childhood, until 14, when she leaves to study in Austria, and the second book covers her time in Europe, and her return to life in Iran up to her late 20s.  This period covers the last years of the Shah, the revolution that overthrew him, the consolidation of the Islamic Republic, the war with Iraq, and through to the present.  A tumultuous time indeed.<br /><br />You would expect any account of growing up in Iran in the last generation to be heartbreaking and terrifying, and Satrapi's story is, but it is also funny in a grim sort of way that can only be told from inside a nightmare.  Most impressive is that the author does not spare herself.  She writes as unflinchingly about her own flaws, petty cruelties and bad decisions as she does about those of all those around her.  The lessons learned are not idealized, and sometimes they are only partially learned, so her travel through life feels very real and very human.<br /><br />Part of the appeal of the story to Westerners, of course, is that Marjane is a very modern Iranian woman.  Raised in a very modern family that is upper middle class by Iranian standards, she struggles with social mores and the education system and we root for her because Westerners (particularly Americans) love stories about individuals overcoming adversity to become their own person.  But that doesn't explain all of the story's appeal.  What makes it so satisfying is the insight into the issue of modernity, and how it manifests through the life of a interesting and all too human character.  We come to understand that being modern and being Western aren't the same thing.  The West is an undeliably strong influence on Marjane and other modern Iranians, but in the story, simply copying Western ways proves unsatisfying at a minimum, and sometimes disasterous.<br /><br />Ultimately, the story is about finding --actually creating -- a life that is both modern and Persian.  It is a tortorous path, and one that Marjane often has to tread alone.  Marjane's friends follow the regime's draconian moral code in public, but break out the party life in private.  Yet Marjane eventually comes to see this as a kind of adolescent rebellion against a parental force that cannot, at present, be overcome.  An incident that illustrates this is her revelation to her closest friends that she's having sex with her boyfriend.  Their shock and disapproval jars her into the realization that modern is a relative concept even amoung modern Iranians.<br /><br />Marjane weathers her trials and emerges with a sort of wisdom.  We admire her for it because she earned it the hard way.  But we also hope, fervently, that people like Marjane will thrive, for they are the ones who will lead Iran into the future.
B000YAF4OS|5.0|i really liked this movie alot! the scrip and the characters was well written,and well placed! after reading some of my fellow amazon critics reviews, i thought i was the only one besides the people in the movie theatre that was happy to see one of characters killed! but i must disagree with some of you about the ending..........i felt that the ending was great,after being placed in the kind of situation they was in, and seeing how everybody was getting killed so grusomely! but i didn't read the orignal book so.....i kind of understand some of you!

I loved the Kite Runner, but can't describe how much I have enjoyed this book. I will wait patiently for Khaled Hosseini to write more. I am a fairly new reader, but have found that I love his writing style and am learning more about how we as humans are so very similar, yet different. We are so fortunate to be women living here in America and have the freedom to speak, vote, work, and learn as we do. Let this book be a reminder of those freedoms that we take for granted every day.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Vedder does a perfect job at weaving the story of Chris McCandless into song.

I haven't been moved by music like this in quite awhile.
B0002XMF5S|2.0|After the exit of Ozzy, many fans dismissed Sabbath. Which is ridiculous to count them out that fast, Dio joined and they churned out two good albums with Heaven & Hell, and The Mob Rules. Then came the great and very underrated Born Again with Ian Gillian of Deep Purple fame (what I consider to be their BEST album). Then Sabbath dropped out of site for awhile, to return with this....<br /><br />While not the worst album Sabbath ever did (that honor falls on Forbidden), the title given above pretty much says it. Black Sabbath does Whitesnake is basically how this feels. While it isn't completely horrible album, the music is pretty decent, bluesy type 80's power metal, it's still mediocre and alot of the songs on here sound like filler. Glenn Hughes is a nice medium between Dio and Gillian's vocals, although on \\"In For The Kill\\" the chorus vocals are pretty funny, and I just can't picture him doing any Ozzy songs live. On the whole, it fits much better as an Iommi solo album, the bare bones are there, but the song writing seems a little rushed, and like not much effort was put into it, but it is a fun listen. It's not the best Sabbath their is, but it's decent, and the last Sabbath album I'd suggest buying, but remember think more along the lines of Whitesnake musically with different vocals. Standout tracks are: In For The Kill, Turn To Stone, Seventh Star, In Memory.
B000R8YC18|5.0|This movie is the most shocking movie I've ever seen, it totally left me with my mind blown,...
B000005RFQ|5.0|This album gets bashed alot, which makes no sense at all because it rocks! Of course, it really isn't traditonal Sabbath at all, as 1983 saw the introduction of frontman Ian Gillian of Deep Purple fame, and he did bring some of the influence with him, which makes for a great album. Now the only 2 bad points of the album here is low production, and the fact that its short on actual songs, with \\"Stonehenge\\" and \\"The Dark\\" just being creepy noise tracks, not that theres anything wrong with them, they give off a great feel and do great on the album, but there's still room for a few more songs to be fit on here. Also, there's no real big deal about the cover on this, it looks ok, and is far from offensive unless you're completely brain dead (although I have to agree with Ian Gillan that it is a little on the ridiculous side).<br /><br />With that said, the music on here is great, the riffs are heavy and tear along, Iommi solos at his best, Gillian's voice fits very well, and Geezer's bass thunders along right with Ward's drums, and for the most part this is a great dark & heavy album. The album starts off with the excellent rocker \\"Trashed\\" that has a great driving riff and it just really rocks out, one of my favorites. It then moves into the above-mentioned \\"Stonehenge\\" which serves as a great connector piece into \\"Disturbing The Priest\\" which is a great heavy classic doom song that has some nice guitar playing in it. Gillian's laughter is a great addition to this song, so evil and creepy. Excellent lyrics that are also very true. \\"The Dark\\" serves as another piece that segues into \\"Zero The Hero\\" which has a great riff, and is just a classic song. The solo's are great on all of these songs and it just leaves you wanting more. This would be the end of side 1 on the original album.<br /><br />\\"Digital Bitch\\" is the next song up and the songs rocks along, however the lyrics are a little silly. The title track is a ballad, and a great one at that, Gillan's vocals sound excellent on this going from low to high notes. \\"Hot Line\\" is another song that rocks along with some nice riffs. The album closes with \\"Keep It Warm\\" which is another slower song whose lyrics arent really typical for Sabbath, but its a good song and ends the album well.<br /><br />I strongly suggest buying this album, it ranks among their best (to me it is their best), and is really the last excellent Black Sabbath album (there's a few good ones to follow, but they never really came back full force), you'll love it.going from low to high notes. \\"Hot Line\\" is another song that rocks along with some nice riffs.

Stir in a number of subtly thought-provoking philosophical tidbits. Sprinkle with thrilling songs.  And top it off with a sinisterly seductive rock star.      That's Labyrinth.

B000K4WLXA|3.0|To be honest, I was disappointed by this \\"collector's edition\\" and should've stayed happy with the original I got. I will not comment on the movie because it is decent; however, all the extra stuff that come with this edition are a big disappointment.    Why do people love anime and japanese RPGs? In my opinion, fantastic artwork's gotta be the answer.  However, the two booklets (novel and script) contain page after page of text, and the only \\"artwork\\" in these are the FFVII logos on the cover.    Then these postcards.  I don't know about you, but the character that I like the most is Aerith, and Red XIII is cool as well.  But no sire, there is no Aerith!!!! (WTF???) Nor is there Red XIII on the postcards. Its all about cloud, sephiroth, barret, and those shinra weirdos whose names I don't even care to remember... who gives a damn about them???  What about Tifa, you ask? Well, yes, she has her postcard alright, but she looks so depressed, as if she were the evil twin of the Tifa from FF7 the game.    There goes my $30+...

0375846735|1.0|I'd like to say I didn't loathe the books, but the movie is just a way to lure people into Pullmans anti-religious world where God is a villain out to control the universe and it's the objective of two children to go out and kill him. (in a 2003 interview he said himself; \\"My books are about killing God.\\"  Not one for subtlety if you ask me.)I saw the preview for the movie and thought I'd read the books... Big mistake.  After reading the first book I was disappointed about where plot ended, and in the second book, things only get worse, by the end of the series God is dead and the two children have reenacted the fall in the garden of eden, but rather than condemning the world, they save it.  In between the religious bashing the books claim many parallels to the C. S. Lewis \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" and J. R. R. Tolkiens \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", apparently trying to appeal to the fans of such novels, but with a  very different agenda; in a 1998 interview Pullman described the C. S. Lewis books as \\"the most ugly and poisonous things I have ever read\\", with, \\"no shortage of nauseating drivel.\\"  I'm a fan of all fiction and I'm not prejudice against someone simply because of their beliefs, but when you try to bash organized religion as a whole, you've gone to far.  This is just warning to those who have seen the movie, the books are a whole other can of worms.
B000026FOA|4.0|As someone whose musical sensibilities were shaped in the 60's, I'm ashamed to say I didn't discover Nick Drake 'till 2000. Someone suggested I listen, and I bought 3 CDs within the week.<br /><br />Listening to his music feels like I missed an artist whose music was as essential to his times as Joni Mitchell or Van Morrison. It feels impossible that his music escaped me at the time. If you've never heard him, take a listen. You won't regret it.
0307346617|3.0|Which, as it turns out after reading about two-thirds of the book, I guess I don't.  Zombies don't offer much as villians go- they moan, they shuffle along, and that's about it.  Brooks does offer up some clever asides, as when he notes that most of us today in the computer age would have no useful skills to offer in the aftermath of a national catastrophe.  I'd recommend this book only for serious zombie lovers.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Greetings!     This is an outstanding series.  Definately a cut above all other TV dramas out there.  The realism of Dexter is what makes it a choice above all others.  It could really happen.  The acting seems as if there is no acting, only reality.  I commend Showtime for this piece of entertainment!    Jason W. Stokes  Fayetteville, NC
0743277457|3.0|Waitzkin is a champion chess player, a champion martial artist, but hasn't yet learned to write.  There are a handful of worthwhile insights, mostly near the end, but most of the book is shallow and cliched. I believe that Waitzkin makes his living, primarily, as a motivational speaker, and he follows the tradition of successful athletes-turned-speakers who preach  in uplifting generalities. No wonder that the blurbs on the back cover are from the likes of Cal Ripkin and Mark Messier.     I've been interested in Waitzkin since I saw the Searching for Bobby Fischer movie and read the book by his father. And more recently, I've followed his success in martial arts. What annoys me is that this man, who put so much effort into learning chess and Tai Chi, put so little into learning to write.    Occasionally, Waitzkin attempts to relate autobiographical material not connected to chess or Tai Chi, such as meeting his girlfriend in Europe. But, aside from discussing his competitive interests, his heart isn't into self-disclosure and the personal stuff goes nowhere.     The problem with The Art of Learning is that, as with a lot of non-fiction books, there is enough information for an article (in this case a short article), but it got stretched into a book. Much of the prose reads as the filler it is. So, after all this criticism, why three stars? The bits that are good are really good.
1594489505|5.0|While I found \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" to be absolutely beautiful, it was very sad.  Like Hosseini's \\"The Kite Runner\\", it takes place in Afghanistan, starting with the Soviet occupation, through the Mujahideen phase and ending with the Taliban government.  However, unlike \\"The Kite Runner\\" which is the story of two boys, this is the story of two girls.      If you read \\"The Kite Runner\\" and thought it was intense, imagine the story of women in Afghanistan.  Both of the main characters, Mariam and Laila are beautifully developed - you can clearly see their growth and their depth.  There are of course men, and they play key roles - both good and bad - in the lives of the protagonists, but this is definitely a story about women in Afghanistan.    While ultimately inspiring, there is much despair, cruelty and tragedy.  There are several scenes that are difficult and uncomfortable to read, but they are not gratuitous.  It is worth the sadness, I highly recommend this book.  I actually liked it better than \\"The Kite Runner\\".
0375423877|4.0|I picked up this book because I thought it might be different, and it certainly was.  It is set in Botswana, and the heroine is Precious Ramotswe.  She certainly is Precious, and this book is a delight.  The book is very well-written and the cases that Precious works on as she sets up her detective agency in Gaborone in Botswana are complex and interesting.  These cases are presented as vignettes in the book, and I found that each one was remarkable in its own right.  And Precious herself is a treasure. She is portrayed as a full-figured African woman who is terribly interested in everyone else's business.  And really, shouldn't a private detective be interested in everything that is going on?  This looks like a promising series.

0345494997|5.0|I finished it and I'm sad. I'm writing about Loving Frank by Nancy Horan.<br /><br />In 1909, Mrs. Mamah Borthwick Cheney left her husband and two small children for the brilliant architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who also left his family and together endured years of scandal. Curiosity got the better of me and I had to research what Mamah looked like. Unfortunately, accompanying the picture I found of her was the one sentence that let me know what happened and my heart sank. But even though I knew what the outcome was (I refused to read the details, letting myself get to that point in the book naturally), it didn't divert me from the story.<br /><br />That's because it is a beautifully, well-written book about a wonderful relationship. Talk about a book you can't put down. I read this book at every opportunity I had. I stayed up late reading it; sat in my car reading it before going shopping, even had the book open on my lap under my desk at work, sneaking in a paragraph here and there. While reading the book I \\"lived\\" with these people. I also fell in love with nature all over again, it's that richly detailed. The book is subtitled A Novel because it is Ms. Horan's fictional account of the real affair and events that took place. Even though the author takes liberties in the conversations between Mamah (nickname for Martha) and Frank, you get a real sense of the couple's time together. I loved how Frank and Mamah had such a deep respect for one another. How he encouraged her literary pursuits, and how she would keep him grounded when he would get a little too self-important. The affair took place almost a hundred years ago but at times it seemed like only yesterday.<br /><br />Knowing how society feels about a woman leaving her children, especially for the man she loves, a modern turn-of-the-century woman like Mamah Borthwick made her choice and lived with the consequences as best she could while being true to herself.  She was an intellectual, compassionate, forthright and a feminist. She admired Emma Goldman; read Charlotte Perkins Gilman; translated and brought Ellen Key's works on free love to America, and was on the cusp of writing an anthology on women's lives. We'll never know what contribution to women's studies she would have made other than being Frank Lloyd Wright's free-thinking lover.he admired Emma Goldman; read Charlotte Perkins Gilman; translated and brought Ellen Key's works on free love to America, and was on the cusp of writing an anthology on women's lives.

B000WGZGNS|5.0|This is simply an amazing concert. I had the great fortune of being present at this very concert. \\"Are you ready to be entertained?\\" Hell yes, I am! I couldn't stop dancing, laughing, and screaming for the entire show! Bee's band, back up singers, and dancers all came together to deliver a mesmerizing performance. As usual Bee's vocals were top notch, who else can do all that dancing and still sing flawlessly!? (During 'Naughty Girl' she does this amazing horn sound with her voice!) Her energy through out the show kept everyone on their feet, and the shows pacing was perfect. I don't want to give anything else away for those who haven't seen the show yet... I'll just say that this is a must buy!
0743496728|1.0|Ever know someone who starts out to tell you a story you want to hear and they keep getting distracted by what they've said and repeatedly tell you background stories that wander off aimlessly, never able to stay on track to tell you the story you care about? If you enjoy that, I recommend this book.    Me? I had to scream, \\"Enough!\\" after getting about three quarters of the way through \\"19 Minutes.\\"    The consolation was that the background stories that the author dredged up served to make each of the key characters in the book so thoroughly unlikable for me that I no longer cared whether good things or bad things happened to them and I lost interest in whether or not there was an upcoming twist in the plot that would reveal that not all was as transparently obvious as it first seemed.

B000002H97|5.0|Metallica (1991), a.k.a. \\"The Black Album\\", is a great way to \\"enter Metallica\\" and start getting into this band even if you're not into metal. You'll most likely recognize quite a few of these songs from the radio airplay they've gotten over the years. Enter Sandman, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Nothing Else Matters and my favorite, Wherever I May Roam, have all been given time on the airwaves. The theme here is pretty much the same for most of the songs. Singer/guitarist James Hetfield plays the introspective, angry loner, who has accepted his bitterness as a way of life. He steps out of the darkness, briefly, in Nothing Else Matters, and chronicles a lifetime of bitterness in The Unforgiven. This stuff is dark, but it's remarkably perceptive, too. The music rocks with heavy metal brilliance, Kirk Hammett's impressive skills on guitar, and Hetfield's menacing vocal presence. Some of Metallica's fans from the early days of thrash (the band has been around for a while) dismiss this album as a commercial sellout, but that's probably more obstinance than reality. \\"The Black Album\\" is a heavy metal album that any rocker can love.
075640407X|5.0|I am pretty new to the world of fantasy fiction, but I've seen enough to know that a great deal of it, while entertaining, reads like it could be written by a child. This book is written as well as any great work of literature and as entertaining as the most beloved fairy tales of all time.  For a first time author, this contribution is so stunning, so well- contrived that I can't wait to see what the next section of the trilogy holds.  This is one book that will always be in my library at home- and never loaned out!!! Thanks Mr. Rothfuss.
0439882826|5.0|A perfect example of the quality and attention to detail I have come to expect from Matthew Reinhart.  The pop-ups are both clever and plentiful and the book has fast become a favourite for the whole family.
B000002G87|5.0|The other reviewers gave some very good details and history of the album. I am 54 years old and I live and die for this album. My first love, my wife (and mother of 4 beautiful children who all love this record today) and I were dating in 1971, cruising on 35 cent per gallon gas in my '67 GTO to the beach (Jones Beach, L.I., NY). I can't add anything else, other than we were fanatical Allman Bros and Grateful Dead Fans at the time. This album is the best. Check out \\"Why Does Love Have to Be so Sad?\\". Duane Allman gives a fantastic straight lead guitar solo (NOT slide). You know it's Duane (if you're an Allman Bros fan), although the credits don't say so. He was harnessed mainly for his slide guitar prowess, although in this song, he really shows what a great guitarist he was. The original legend was that Eric Clapton saw the Allman Bros. playing at the Fillmore East in NYC in circa 1970 and went back stage to ask Duane if he would contribute to the Layla effort.  Actually, Eric saw the Allman Bros. in Florida and went back stage and the rest is history. Derek and the Dominos was born! It doesn't get any better than this. \\"Any Day\\" is a guitar virtuoso classic too. PLEASE, listen to this album. Listen to the Allman Bros too. And by the way, check out Derek Trucks on slide guitar with the Allman Bros.. He is now, where Duane would have been had he not met his sad, untimely death in '71. Another album you will want to look out for is Clapton's Chicago Guitarfest. Derek is on that one too.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Because of its incongruous mixture of images, the opening montage of this film brings to mind the adagio introduction at the beginning of the first movement of Mozart's String Quartet in C Major (K. 465), the so-called \\"Dissonance\\".  The both introductions clearly create the feeling of angst.<br /><br />This rather complex film reminds us how our knowledge of ourselves, and especially of others, has its natural, insurmountable limits.  Because we all wear masks (at least to some degree) our knowledge of what exactly is going on inside someone's mind (including our own) simply cannot be complete.  In this respect we do not live in some sort of a perfect, unambiguous, deterministic, Newtonian world, but rather we live in a world akin to that of quantum mechanics, with all its uncertainties and probabilities.  Other people, no matter how hard they try, can never understand us completely.
B00009XFS3|5.0|Now, when Davis' fusion bands set into a groove, there was no stopping them. In a Silent Way is good proof of that, one unstoppable, LP-long groove. It's ethereal, all right, but it's also funky and surprisingly full of life for a project so quiet. Your main voices are Miles' trumpet, McLaughlin's guitar, and Shorter's soprano sax; Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, and Joe Zawinul play interlocking keyboard parts that add lots of texture and make \\"Shh/Peaceful\\" the haunting, almost alien experience that it is. The soloing on \\"Shh/Peaceful\\", by the way, is brilliant, especially Shorter's haunting sax work. So is Miles' theme (repeated at the end of the piece - Teo Marceo arranged both pieces by essentially copying their first part and splicing them onto the end of each track) .If that doesn't sway you, there's always the keyboards, and Dave Holland's brilliant, unpredictable bass playing, with lots of complex arpeggios in some sections and a simple two-note theme in others. Even better is the title suite. The cool about it is that it starts out absolutely beautifully, little more than McLaughlin and Davis soloing over a gorgeous keyboard background. Then it explodes into \\"It's About That Time\\", a much livelier funk song with excellent electric piano soloing; a short but sweet burst of Miles' trumpet, more tasty McLaughkin guitar, and - my favorite part - the \\"groove section\\". That's when Holland, Zawinul, Corea, and Hancock touch on this theme - doot doot doot do do, do do do - that's one of the coolest in history. And they have the good sense to keep it going as Wayne pulls another great solo out of his bag of tricks - and then, with that groove continuing (love the groove! I could just listen to it all day!), Miles upstages Shorter. And then Tony Williams goes absolutely crazy - with this groove still going, and with Miles still soloing like a demon. Then they take it down several notches. My only complaint about this record, and the only thing that keeps it from being my favorite Miles record, comes in that little second between the song's climax and cool-down - there's this little awkward pause, brief but still noticeable. Pretty bad editing, if you ask me. But then the groove comes back, so I'm not complaining. There's another one of those pauses between the end of \\"It's About That Time\\" and the repetition of \\"In a Silent Way\\", but I actually think that pause makes sense, since you know, we're segwaying from part two back to part one here. And besides, it's still some of the most heavenly music I've ever heard. It's true that there's some bad editing on this disc, but there's what, a fraction of a second of it? Blerf. That's very forgivable. I can excuse a fraction of a second of bad editing on a genius thirty-eight minute album, that's for sure. Two sidelong, twenty-minute compositions that are more or less perfect? I'll take 'em! I already listed the personnel in a scattershot way, but in case you're dumber than I am, here it is in a condensed format: Miles on trumpet; Wayne Shorter on soprano sax; John McLaughlin making his debut as Miles' loyal axeman; Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Joe Zawinul on a three-pronged keyboard attack; Dave Holland on bass; and Tony Williams on drums. This was Tony Williams' last album with Miles, which is quite unfortunate, because he is the man when it comes to drumming. Did you know that he used to leave Miles in the dust, back when they first started playing together? And he was seventeen! Not when this album came out, but when he started with Miles.

B000002KYR|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! Easily Top's best & most consistent album. This was not only a commercial breakthrough for them (they had never reached the public like this before), it still retains Z Z Top's signature sound & songs (unlike their follow-up Afterburner). Eliminator was the Top's eighth studio album & it peaked at #9 on the charts. There were five singles from the album that entered the charts. The were \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\" (#8 Mainstream Rock, #37 Pop Singles), \\"Got Me Under Pressure\\" (#18 Mainstream Rock), \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" (#8 Mainstream Rock, #56 Pop Singles), \\"TV Dinners\\" (#38 Mainstream Rock) & \\"Legs\\" (#13 Club Play, #8 Hot 100). Half the songs from the album hit at least some form of a chart; many an artist dream that they could do this. It's a very enviable position but closer analysis shows that most of these are 'specialty' charts which aren't the best indicators for what the song is really doing.    The album opens with one of their best songs \\"Gimme All your Lovin'\\" It's got a driving beat & thick guitars. \\"Got Me Under Pressure\\" is a solid rock song. Then comes the incredible \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" with Billy Gibbon's witty lyrics & a driving beat; one of the Top's very best songs.  \\"I Need You Tonight\\" is one of the very best album tracks Z Z Top has ever recorded. It's a slow tempo blues-rock song that never gets boring. Gibbons plays an amazing lead solo in the song. I could put this song in my car's cd player, drive from New York City to Los Angeles & might not put on another song. A little exaggeration, sure, but it's just that good. \\"I Got the Six\\" has vocals by Dusty Hill but is a sub-par song. \\"Legs\\" is the last outstanding song on the album, it's full of innuendos & one of their best. \\"Thug\\" is a song that's somewhat different for the Top, it's got a snap bass that's very unique for them. Then comes the hilarious \\"TV Dinners\\", a subtle reminder that they're still in contact with us common folk. \\"Dirty Dog\\" is another weak song as is \\"If I Could Only Flag Her Down\\". The latter one is merely a simple reworking of the blues formula. The album closes with \\"Bad Girl\\" with Hill once again doing the lead vocal, it's just average rock 'n' roll.    1983 was a big year for Z Z Top. They were now getting some mainstream airplay plus they were getting some club play action too. They released their first videos in conjunction with this album. The young MTV network was playing their videos in heavy rotation. Z Z Top was getting exposure on a level that had never happened before. To this day this is the last great album they have released. But for a while that 'L'il ol' band from Texas had hit the big time in a way few artists ever have.
B000ZN802W|5.0|I love this movie. I love the message of this movie. I love the way the music and scenery of this movie makes me yearn for a simpler life. (Although I don't agree with Eddie Vedder's politics in particular, the songs he wrote specifically for the movie are nothing short of genius). I love this movie. If you want an unbiased review, you'll need to look elsewhere. :-)     I grew up in the Pacific Northwest so I'm probably biased by the fact that I spent chunks of my youth driving out into the wilds of Washington, BC, and Alaska with my dad and brothers to hike, camp and fish... I have often contemplated just dropping the trappings of a material society and walking into the woods in search of a simpler life.    This movie makes me yearn for that, and yet manages to bring me around gently to its *Real* message at the end- made all that much more powerful because of my pull towards ditching it all for the wilderness... The real point that Chris learns (and that we are reminded of along with him) is that the beauty and simplicity of Gods wilderness is plain and simple selfishness without others around to serve, love, and enjoy it with. In the end removal of one's self from society is just as selfish of an act as embracing the 'necessity' of wholehearted materialism that being a consumer in America seems to demand.    Did I mention that I loved this movie? In case I was unclear above... I loved this movie!
0060872675|4.0|We got this book as a gift for our newborn son.  And it has quickly become one of the favorites for the household.  The story within a story within a story format makes for a fun read.  And my son (now 2) is starting to recognize pieces from the story before we ever get there.    If you're looking for a fun bedtime read, it can't get much better than this!
159102594X|4.0|I won't rehash what others have written, but I would like to add one observation.  The book consists of several story lines that all meet up at the end of the book.  One of the longest story lines about a soldier preparing for a fencing tournament is tedious and IMHO literally could have been cut out of the book.  The other story lines, however, are fabulous and make the book well worth reading.  I wish the author had spent more time, for example on the other story lines, especially the one concerning the remaining members of Nine-Fingers' old band.
B0000026TD|5.0|Dancing with the Lion is IMHO the best of Andreas' many wonderful albums. Each album is lovely but \\"Dancing\\" tops them all. Music is sacred to me and this album is one of a handful of \\"sacrament albums\\" I own. I only listen to it when the time is right for an uninteruppted session of introspection. I was motivated to try to write a review because of a previous review by juliall who mentions that it is a must if you ever go camping or spend an evening out. She is correct and I cannot echo her sentiments enough. \\"Dancing\\" was and is played on every camping trip I go on. After the sun sets and the fire is lit, Andreas' haunting CD is started up and I disappear into the special combination of the real environment and the special place that Vollenweider creates. The music is beyond words. I will not even try to review it in a normal sense...see the other reviews for that. It IS truly sublime. My first listening took place on a mountaintop in Southern Arizona. I was blown away. Each listening has been in other beautiful places such as the bottom of the Grand Canyon. If you understand what I mean about music's inherent potential, buy it and listen with a calm mind. If you don't understand but can open your mind, find a quiet, dark place, light a fire, start up the CD player and put on the headphones. You'll find something very useful and timeless.

B000VNMMQQ|1.0|First, let me say that LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is not only the worst film in the DIE HARD series, but one of the saddest, most desperate attempts to revive the popular franchise and make it \\"accessible\\" to today's younger audiences.    The story centers on a group of computer terrorists led by a very, very young and angry man who is also a former member of our governement.  To prove a very radical point, he takes control of the United States by systematically shutting down our computer infrastructure.  And of course, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's up to John McClane to save the day.    It seems that since the horrific events of September 11, 2001, we, as a country have learned nothing!  Not only did we go to war with the wrong enemy, but Hollywood film makers continue to get their kicks by seeing how much they can destroy our cities and people on screen.  In my opinion, a story about an American choosing to willfully cripple his own country in such a manner is nothing short of IRRESPONSIBLE!  Our foreign enemies need only watch a movie like LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD to be further inspired on how to attack our country again!    I knew that I would not like this movie even before it started.  I mean, really, how much can you expect from any Part IV sequel??  I never expected to walk away feeling angry, though.

I hate it so bad I would rather go to a Barbra Streisand concert or see all 9 hours of Anne of Greene Gables and those evil PBS fund raisers in between than suffer the sheer torture of Annie.

B0001WTWCO|5.0|On many a social occasion, when the 'best movie' topic is raised, the first film to bubble up in my mind is The English Patient. It somehow reached deep within, and remained there for life.<br /><br />Superbly directed by Anthony Minghella, the film tells the story of forbidden love - found and lost - wonderfully portrayed by Scott-Thomas and Fienes and the rest of the cast. The film has no hidden agendas: it merely reflects our inner yearnings and poetic flaws; set in beautiful locations with superb cinematogrpahy, and rounded off in a moving score by Gabriel Yared.<br /><br />It was a film  regarded 'doomed' in its pre-production, which soured like and eagle in the end.<br /><br />One of the best ever made...
B000I0QKDS|5.0|The reason why I bought this album several years ago is because I always heard comparisons with this Jeff Beck lineup and Led Zeppelin. Listen to this album and you will see why. I love both bands and that is probably why I love this album along with Beck-Ola. I immediately blamed Led Zeppelin for copying this after my first time listening. I did not want to but could not help it. I still do this day. I liked the Yardbirds the most when Beck was in charge. And I like this band as much as Led Zeppelin though I think they would have been better had they could have kept Ansley Dunbar on drums. This album rocks and is one of the most important albums in the 60s that contributed to heavy rock. Too bad this band did not get the attention Led Zeppelin,Cream,and Jimi Hendrix all had. Its every bit as good and even better in some places.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|A sweet, warm, touching movie with great music.  It certainly wasn't what I expected, but the main characters are just so real and nice that you feel like they are your friends.  The music drags you in emotionally with its power and humor and even ferocity.  One of the best I've seen recently.  I'm so glad that occasionally a treasure like this sneaks out of the creative abyss to touch us.    William J. Trinkle
B00004I9VE|1.0|The music video of this traumatized me as a child as well as the movie Annie. They both came out around the same time and scared the $#*+ out of me! I saw the video again on Vh1 Classic and it reminded me of how bad it really was. This album should have been called \\"BAD\\". But I guess Michael Jackson would have run out of names for future products that were not any better. Weird Al Yakovic wasted his time making fun of the songs on this album that already make fun of themselves. \\"The Girl is Mine\\" is the only song that was actually good on this album. I am certain Paul McCartney is the reason for this. Other than that not even Eddie Van Halen could save him on \\"Beat It\\". And Michael Jackson does not seem any more masculine than David Lee Roth which does not make it or the video any better. My question is why did they remaster THIS ALBUM to 5.1! What makes it so revolutionary or special. 80s were a scary time and commercialism just got worse after this album. If you want a great album that desrves to be in 5.1 over any other album get Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon instead. It sounds incredible and like it came from another planet.
0380799006|5.0|What I like most about this book is not its practicality (it's VERY practical -- you can do this stuff ASAP), but its underlying theme that dealing with sibling problems helps build children's self-worth.  There's tons of great examples on how to get your kids to stop fighting -- what to say and how to say it in the right way.  That's the practical part.  But underneath everything is the fact that sibling rivalry can affect us well into adulthood and define who we are as people.  The authors show us that helping siblings get along isn't just nice for our own peace and quiet, but that in the long term it helps our children feel confident and learn to creatively solve problems on their own.    There's also cartoon examples that are easy to show/share with other caregivers who aren't reading the entire book.
B000O78KW4|4.0|He has got a big headache all day, he mets Hans brother is this sequel.
B00006AW2F|4.0|..For sure it's an album of outtakes but \\"I'm going down\\" deserves to be  amongst the essential tracks by Keith..awesome...
B00008OWZC|4.0|Play Disc 1 for the Zeppelin that you missed on The Song Remains the Same. Every cut smokes, particularly \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", which handily obliterates the studio version. Even the overplayed, unnecessarily stretched-out \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is a stunner. Don't forget \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Immigrant Song\\", etc. These guys were at their best in this performance, and this disc is proof positive that their legend is well deserved. What a ride.  Discs 2 & 3 are 4-song affairs, each with 2 relatively short, fairly amazing versions of songs you know and love, bookended by LONG cuts that you can take or leave. \\"Dazed and Confused\\" is a monster of a song, groundbreaking, terrifying, blah blah blah. But here as in SRTS, Jimmy Page turns it into a 25-minute, self indulgent, BORING showoff opportunity for his rich-guy guitar tricks. Who cares? Did I mention it's BORING? As for \\"Moby Dick\\", it's a 20-minute drum solo. See above. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" runs just as long but actually regains its momentum after the middle section, running through a medley of old songs before they charge through the climax. \\"Bring It On Home\\" is the best (and shortest) of the long numbers, and a pretty hot ending for the set.   The bottom line is that Zeppelin was an incredible live band, with or without their indulgences. And since this is the only worthy live set available from them, you need it. What do you think the skip button is for?
B00006HAZG|5.0|As a lover of the novel, I began to watch this with a bit of scepticism. However, I soon realized that it was a top-notch production and I settled down into it and greatly enjoyed it. I highly recommend this DVD and will be buying it soon.
0618680004|4.0|Of all of the recent anti-religion sorts of books, this one definitely outshines the others. Dawkins makes many good points. That is why I would encourage ANYONE to read this. However, I think that there is enough of his opinion mixed in that many readers who have strong religious beliefs may get tired of trying to sort through such an opposing opinion. Determined not to be impressed by the shiny cover and forceful title, I enjoyed this book a lot more than I expected initially. I feel it is important for people to read things that challenge their beliefs. It is how we grow. So, if you are at all interested after reading the description and all these reviews, you should definitely read this book. It is quite a bit better than other recent ones on the subject.
B000935TV8|5.0|I recentlty heard a couple tracks from this cd on Xm and was blown away.  I am the traditional Mozart lover along with the other great masters.  I bought the CD and have listened to it alot.  It is a very wonderfully done piece.  I especially like that it was put together from various collections of the composer Rameau.

0385339100|4.0|At first, in the book The Partner I wasn't a big fan of the main character, Patrick. I was not quite sure if I was supposed to want Patrick to get away with everything but found myself on his side even though I didn't know why he had committed this theft. I did admire the way he had every angle thought out. The book was hard to put down. The constant legal twists and turns in the story kept me riveted. Mr. Grisham kept me interested with the number of players in the plot and then he planted this hidden thought of what would it be like to start life over?<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I would recommend it highly. Beware; the ending is not expected and rather disheartening.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|I watched this movie with my family and was moved. It's hard being a father to watch another in such dire situations. while trying to take care of his Child(ren) the real Chris Gardner had a daughter also. The true star of the movie is the interaction on film of Will Smith and his real life son Jaden was touching. I saw an actor holding his son, crying, thiking about his own child and how lucky we all are to have what we do. His performance was touching because of this. But also of him playing with his son was fun to see as well, the happy moments.<br /><br />two small things i found out after going to wikipedia:<br />-Chris Gardner has a daughter also.<br />-he was paid 1,000 per month while interning.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|Of course, having the complete Friends series is awesome, and I love the packaging.... Unfortunately mine arrived already damaged.  The outer box was fine, but two of the little booklets inside that hold the disks were ripped!!!  How could this happen when it's shrink wrapped.  Obviously they were torn during manufacturing and they just didn't care and sold it anyway.  Not impressed that my \\"collectors item\\" is ripped!  Still love the show though and the discs themselves seem okay, I'll get over it.
B000X3KZVI|5.0|I was at the concert she performed in Las Vegas Nevada, and let me tell you, crowd was crazy over her.  I can't wait to pick this DVD up and relive this noght.  It was the second time I had seen her in concert and looking forward to many other concert appearances by her!!!!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|The Jungle Book is a delightful romp of fun and music and a wonderful story. My kids love it. We have looked and looked for this one for so long, even pretty hard to rent at the local library, so we were there when it finally came out for sale by Disney. Get it! It's a classic that will be watched for years.
B000UJCALI|5.0|I already had this film on dvd but in fullscreen 4:3 aspect ratio. Now with a 32\\" LCD TV I'm happy to have this anamorphic 1.77:1 widescreen version. You are much more in the film. This looks much better. like in the theatre. Good choice of Warner to release these widescreen versions. Finally!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Pixar is amazing, not only does their animation blow away everyone else, the characters and plot lines are deeper and more compelling. Great fun with some real poignant moments. I had to warm up to a movie about a rat, I have this thing about rats, but in a way the movie plays up to this fear and eventually you will find yourself wrapped up in this film. It is funny, wonderful and enchanting. Oh yeah, the kids loved it too! It is the \\"hot\\" film right now, their fav, the INCREDIBLES and NEMO used to hold this estemmed perch. That ole Pixar magic strikes again!
0060977493|5.0|Excellent novel for semi-experienced and experienced readers (comp. Toni Morrison's _Sula_, Jean Rhys' _Wide Sargasso Sea_).  Poignant, shocking, yet not gross.  Beautiful language, mature style. I rate it as one of the 10 top books of my life.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|What an uplifting movie. My wife and I saw it in a theater with surround sound and felt a part of it. We're of the American Bandstand era and it brought back fond memories. John Travolta was terrific. You forgot Edna was a man. The music and dancing were first rate. This will be a classic like Grease.
B0000648WZ|4.0|\\"Starship Troopers\\" is a bizarre combination of Paul Verhoeven weirdness, WWII propoganda film, cartoonish sci-fi...and a commentary on the dangers of fascism!<br /><br />Like \\"Robocop\\" and \\"Total Recall\\" Verhoeven successfully creates a world all his own. It could be the same world as \\"Robocop\\" and \\"Total Recall\\" where people are constantly the victims of malevolence - be it from man or machine. His usual trademarks are here: over the top violence tempered by nice little details and touches of humour. The actors are lightweights but this fits in with the cartoonish action.<br /><br />The special effects are mostly really good. The musical score is disappointing. \\"Starship Troopers\\" has a \\"low-budget\\", \\"B-movie\\" feel about it - not entirely to its disadvantage.<br /><br />The DVD commentary with Verhoeven and screenwriter Ed Neumeier is absolutely fascinating and well worth the price of the DVD.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|I thought I had ordered Shrek 3 from NetFlix but received the first one instead. I had seen it earlier and since I truly enjoyed it, I decided to watch it again.  And guess what? It was just as entertaining as I remembered.    Shrek is so \\"ugly he's cute\\" and the wise-cracking Donkey is hilarious. They make unlikely traveling companions as Donkey attaches himself to Shrek as he heads off to regain his swamp by bringing a princess to a scheming lord who fancies himself to be the king.    Wait until you see the array of fairy-tale characters who've taken over Shrek's swamp. What happens to them? And what happens when Shrek meets the lovely princess? Will she accompany them willingly? Will she be forced to marry the despicable lord? Or will Shrek and Donkey save the fair princess and regain his swamp?    And most important, what is Fiona's secret? Shrek is pleasantly surprised when he learns her secret, and I think you will be too.     Unless someone else is a \\"spoiler\\" and has already told you, you'll have to see for yourself.  But whatever ... I'm sure you'll enjoy this simple story that's brought to life by such lovable characters.    I just returned this DVD to Netflix and have ordered Shrek 2 and 3, so I'll be reviewing those shortly. They'll have to be really good to be as good as this first one, but I hope they are.
B0002XL35G|2.0|this film is simply too long, especially considering the no-surprises-anywhere plot. I consider myself an \\"art house\\" film buff, and this is exactly the sort of movie that gives the \\"drama\\" category a bad name. I can't give it lower than two stars though, because it has lots of redeeming features like splendid acting, the music and especially the cinematography. But nothing can save a film from bad editing and an unimaginative script.
0974869449|5.0|These flashcards turned out to be pretty useful for me. They are very comfortable to use - they have round corners and covered with plastic. Each kanji has a SOD diagram that is a necessity if you want to learn to write kanji correctly. On-readings are written in katakana and kun-readings - in hiragana (I hate romaji). I am a beginner so the number of examples for each kanji (6 examples per kanji) is quite enough for me. Though there is a little flaw - all cards have their own numbering and I can't find a proper kanji in edict for example using that number.   All in all this is a good way to learn kanji and get accustomed to using kana at the same time.
B0006399FS|2.0|These lads clearly have seen better days. I believe they still have enough left to justify their existence but unfortunately Achtung Baby is a ghost while listening to this long player. Like Sachin Tendulkar at the crease these musicians still induce awe but could anyone honestly describe them as the band in the world on the basis of this long player?
B000TGQDZQ|2.0|I totally agree with the earlier reviewer - musically Epica is wonderful, the music is epic metal and sheer brilliance, with Simone's vocals never been better.  But the moment those grunts come in, the whole album is ripped off of my player and tossed into the amazon marketplace.  It's a matter of taste, I understand, but I find nothing musical, interesting, or in any way palatable about listening to someone gargling to the music.  If I wanted to hear singing Uruk'hai I'd watch the LOTR outtakes.  But to my way of thinking (and listening) the grunts/roars/growls ruin a fantastic album.  Too bad bands like this can't make two versions - one with the growls for those who are into them, and one without so that the rest of us can really get into the epic symphonic rock and won't miss out on what bands like this are doing.  But for my money, I'll stick with the female-fronted bands that don't insist on injecting the growls into their work.

B000BUYP4Q|5.0|This is hands down the best tv or movie version of Batman to be created.  IMO, it ties with X2 for the best movie adaptation of a comic. Whether you're a hardcore comic fan or you just enjoy a good action movie, it's definitely worth watching.  The 2 disc DVD is loaded with special features.
0307387178|2.0|Attention would-be \\"hermits:\\" Alaskan winters are still very cold. Krakauer illustrates quite clearly the consequences of being an idiot in the woods. Nature, romantic notions of it notwithstanding, can and will kill you. Beware. Decent work by Mr. Krakauer, but the story left behind by Mr. McCandless remains at best as a good example of a very bad idea.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|Ok I said it, I don't like the way Renee squeezes, purses her lips it drives me crazy.  Other than that this is cute movie.  Based on the real life of Miss Potter the author of children's books like Peter the Rabbit.  It showcases Miss Potter's artistic abilities and imagination to which she dedicated her lifes work to.  I really enjoyed the animated drawings that popped out randomly.  This is good one to watch with the family.
0143038419|5.0|I've read many, many \\"spiritual\\" books and none has changed me more than this one.  The author is achingly truthful.  I've started meditating again and began a yoga practice.  I've read the negative reviews, and all I can say is \\"to each his own\\".  This book was life changing for me.
B000UX6THK|4.0|Ok, I'm subtracting 1 star due to the way it was released after last years marketing release bunglef'ck. Marketing people usually ruin everything.   Anyway, well designed media. All the episodes in one package. Lot's of extras. Definitely worth having if you are a fan of one of the best shows ever aired on TV.
6305181810|4.0|Yes, there's Coppolla. And Damon. And De Vito. But the performance to watch is Mary Kay Place. Brilliant. She deserved an Oscar nomination.
B000VUFJ3C|3.0|Since it's obvious that it wouldn't make sense for *NSYNC to get back together (if you don't know why, then you've been living under a rock for the last three years), maybe that's why Backstreet Boys decided to release another album; or maybe it's because that I'm the only person that heard Brian Littrell's solo album Welcome Home (which IS good, by the way). Whatever the case, the guys come back at us with Unbreakable.<br /><br />One difference with this album is that Kevin Richardson is gone. And that's really noticeable too because he did a lot of the lead singing -- well...he produced a lot of the songs -- um...he WROTE a lot of the songs -- uh...gee, I guess he really DIDN'T do much, did he? Oh, well; Brian, Howie, Nick and A.J. still soldier on as a foursome. But I was a little skeptical to pick up this album because they sounded pretty terrible when they performed \\"Inconsolable\\" on the Tonight Show a few weeks ago (well, Nick and Howie sounded all right). Thankfully, their voices do sound fine here -- especially Brian's, who was virtually invisible on their last \\"comeback\\" album, Never Gone.<br /><br />Speaking of Never Gone, though, I have the same problem with this album that I had with THAT album, only more so: almost every song on here is about heartbreak, and even songs that don't appear to be going in that direction end up doing so after all, like \\"Trouble Is\\" and especially \\"Helpless When She Smiles\\". All this coins the title \\"Something That I Already Know\\", but another thing that drives the point of that song home is that it sounds almost identical to \\"Inconsolable\\", the very song that precedes it.<br /><br />It's not that those songs are bad, but when not taken lightly, they just make things a little too depressing and monotonous. But things DO pick up with selections like \\"Unmistakable\\" and \\"Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon\\". I'm sure BSB still have devoted fans (especially since this album debuted in the top 10), but I really don't think this will gain them any NEW fans, so really only buy Unbreakable to complete your Backstreet Boys collection.<br /><br />Anthony Rupertreally only buy Unbreakable to complete your Backstreet Boys collection.

B000IU3Y1O|4.0|I bought this collection for the videos DVD, and I wasn't disappointed; it provided some music videos not previously released on DVD (though I'm waiting on the entire Some Great Videos set to come to DVD--which has about a icecube's chance in Hades of happening).  However, the actual audio content of this CD is disappointing.  The most glaring omission is a representative track from Black Celebration, which is the favorite DM LP of many fans.  Adding either \\"A Question of Time\\" or \\"Stripped\\" would have made me believe this is a true retrospective \\"Best of\\" set, though I understand that Daniel Miller (head of Mute records, who put this set together) has said the following about Black Celebration: \\"The songs aren't good enough, there aren't any singles and it'll never get played on the radio.\\"  The DM fans love you, Danny Boy, but get over it.    Another note: While \\"See You\\" was a big Depeche Mode hit in the UK, I think \\"Leave in Silence\\" would have been a better representative of the transitional period of A Broken Frame, because it is a great indicator of the direction DM is beginning to take musically.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I'm one of the great '69 babies.  I purchased this c.d. last year and gave it to a friend of mine who lives on the west coast before I had even listened to the second disc, and before I had a chance to load it on my Itunes.  This c.d. is priceless.  I procrastinated and life got hectic, as it does sometimes.  But I was driving to work last week and all of a sudden \\"Can You Feel It?\\" popped into my head!  I remember when my brothers and sisters came home from The Jacksons concert.  They couldn't stop talking about it!  And last week I could not get that song out of my head.  I was immediately remorseful for having taken so long to repurchase The Essential Michael Jackson. I jumped on Amazon and had it in my hands two days later (courtesy of Amazon Prime).  I have NOT stopped playing it.  I've seen people driving next to me looking into my car as I'm singing to the top of my lungs, moving my hands and my body.  This is what good music is all about.  Thanks Mike, and thanks to the whole Jackson family for giving us consistently good music for decades.  My c.d. player honors you.
B000SUKPKM|4.0|I like this but I feel the sequencing could have been a little bit better, maybe in chronilogical order. Why is Iris the last track? The new version of Name is good, but no way does it compare to the original. Hopefully there will be a volume 2 in the near future as the band already has enough soundtrack hits to fill up that cd.
B000WCDI64|2.0|Maybe I can get through this if I just put it on the tv, leave the room and get busy while listening.  Watching it is too painful.  She is drunk, continues to drink and get more drunk throughout the show.  Breaks my heart.  I love her music, but am old enough to be her mother and I can't help but watch with sadness.  I realize I may just be too old, and young peeps enjoy this kind of performance, but I know I will never be able to sit and watch it.  Will maybe sell on Ebay and just continue to enjoy her music, hope that she gets it together soon.  She reminds me of Billie Holiday, and I even wonder at times if she is her reincarnated soul...back here to \\"get it right\\" but so far not succeeding.  Listen to her tunes.  There are a few especially on the Frank Album (one in particular) where you would swear it was Billie if you didn't know.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|This is Hitchcock at his most accessible. Gloriously acted and photographed. Dramatic. Funny. Nerve-wracking. I think I can finally say for sure it is my favorite movie of all time.
006085880X|2.0|Though the writing style was engaging and kept me turning the pages, I was deeply disappointed by the book's resolution and the development of the characters. POSSIBLE SPOILERS. Everyone seems to have gotten away with everything, and no one seems to have learned from their experiences. Chris does seem to grow some sensitivity and humanity in jail (in fact, the jail scenes and inmate characters seemed most realistic), but for someone who claims to have a soulmate, he is amazingly dense. My heart breaks for poor Emily -- much is made of her not wanting to have sex with Chris because he has become like a brother to her. However, the author seems to gloss over the part where Em doesn't seem interested in having sex with ANYONE because she was MOLESTED. (And molested by a fast-food worker with greasy hair and a lazy eye? Central casting is the best we could do with this essential character?) This book is an exercise in frustration with no justice whatsoever for Emily, but example after example after example of how the people who should have loved her the most let her down. It wore me out and made me sad. (And not the refreshing good cry sad, just bitterly disappointed.)
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|Based on a letter I recently received (promotes me getting their insurance so I can cash in on almost $300,000 in payouts), I'm seriously thinking about taking them up on their offer. The hospital doesn't sound too bad if I can get $292,000! I hate the smell of hospitals because they smell like old people and people are always coughing, but screw it, I would go to the hell hole known as the hospital if I could get all that cash.<br /><br />Obviously, this is a little out of context. They mean if I'm sick and can't work, I'll get enough money to cover anything- up to that amount if I pay along their little monthly installments. But this illustrates a major problem in the health care industry and insurance that I promise the obese Michael Moore doesn't bring up in his \\"Sicko\\" - the system encourages people to be sick. According to , well, everyone, you just HAVE to get healthcare insurance because \\"What if something happens!?\\"<br /><br />Politicians don't even question whether people should have health insurance, they just pop out the number of Americans who are uninsured as if it's a given that they should be insured under the current system. Once you get health insurance, however, it's like a free-for-all: everything's \\"free.\\" That's what they want you to think. You get all these benefits and perks and it's all FREE! You become dependent on the system and you become sicker and sicker in the process.<br /><br />The problem is that healthcare is NOT free. it's anything but free.  It costs a buttload to care for all these fat arse smoking careless numbnuts and the current system does nothing to prevent people from getting sick because they benefit when people ARE sick.  There wouldn't be much of a health care industry if people weren't getting sick all the time.<br /><br />The only system that would work is an insurance system that pays people for NOT getting sick as opposed to the opposite- the way it is now.  If I'm paying insurance, I need to \\"get my money's worth\\" so I'll go for a checkup when I just went; I'll take the $150 drugs I only need to pay $10 for; I'll continue smoking because when my heart collapses, I get a \\"free\\" ambulance ride.<br /><br />Wake up people- insurance is prison and healthcare as it is is making you sicker!<br /><br />A public service announcement brought to you by the makers of: [[ASIN:1600200427 Why Baby Boomers Suck!: (No Offense Mom)]]just went; I'll take the $150 drugs I only need to pay $10 for; I'll continue smoking because when my heart collapses, I get a \\"free\\" ambulance ride.

0307387151|4.0|This book has been on my shelf for some time, but when it was filmed, and  a part of it was filmed in the town I live (a rarity in these parts) , I decided it was about time, before the film came out, to read it. Seeing the film first would, as always, spoil it for me.<br />So...<br />Although I consider myself a seasoned reader, it took me a while to figure this one out, in terms of how the characters fit together and how things would develop; of why certain things were narrated the way they were, why things were relevant to the story at all.<br />From a historical perspective the novel was quite fascinating, and apart from the narrative itself being sweeping, I also found individual segments of the story to be gripping in themselves. For example, the scene where Turner and his mates rescue a marine; this was so insightful in terms of human nature, that it gave the scene a true ring.<br />The question: 'What exactly is the atonement?' is answered towards the end of the book. Maybe it is the way I interpreted this, but to me it seemed that the atonement is the actual novel. The confession, fully, the not hiding anything, the discovery that this is actually a looking back.<br />The end of the novel is satisfying, an acceptance, a return to innocence in some ways, and a coming full circle, back to the beginning of the novel.<br />There is also that realisation of not being able to undo, of having to live with choices.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I purchased this item as a gift for my husband, which was something he truly wanted after seeing it on HBO. I was surprised to find that I also enjoyed the series.

630587493X|5.0|Robin Williams was absolutely wonderful in this role. He was both sensitive and charming as the robot Andrew. His portrayal makes you believe that if one truly wanted to become the best human that you can possibly be, then one should be able to accomplish this. This portrayal is one of Issac Asimov's best of the robot short stories. Highly recommended.
038533348X|2.0|Cat's Cradle falls way short of expectations. Vonnegut has been said by others to be a satirical genius, but all his humor is lost on me. The story chronicles a man named Jonah, who attempts to make a novel regarding August 6, 1945, the day the first atomic bomb was dropped. He then decides to write to Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the creators of the atomic bomb, to ask him what happened in his house on the day that the atomic bomb dropped. Jonah then on his way to do another story passes through Illium, New York, the place where Dr. Felix Hoenikker conducted the majority of his research on the atomic bomb and ice-nine, a form of ice that has a melting point of one hundred fourteen point four degrees Fahrenheit. While in Illium, he interviews many who knew Dr. Felix Hoenikker, including his former boss, about what the man who created the atomic bomb was really like. Another story then takes Jonah to the Republic of San Lorenzo, where another one of the sons of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, Major General Franklin Hoenikker is prominent in government. When the president, Miguel \\"Papa\\" Monzano falls ill and dies the logical choice to succeed him is Major General Franklin Hoenikker. Major General Franklin Hoenikker then strikes a deal with Jonah for Jonah to become president in exchange for Jonah marrying Mona Aamons Monzano, the most beautiful woman in San Lorenzo. At San Lorenzo, Jonah also finds a new religion, Bokononism, which admits to containing only lies. Despite this all the poor inhabitants of this dreadful island are devout Bokononists. The vast majority of Vonnegut's characters are utterly implausible, ranging from Zinka, a Ukrainian midget, Newt falls in love with, to Philip Castle, the homosexual one time fiancé of Mona Aamons Monzano, to Bokonon, a man who created a religion consisting of only lies and turned himself into a saint and the President of San Lorenzo into a villain. While the entirety of Cat's Cradle is a parody against religion, technology, government and society in general it is not comical at all.
0374105235|5.0|I literally just finished reading this book about 10 minutes ago and I am still amazed at how great this book was. Beah did an incredible job at keeping my attention throughout the entire book. Very easy to read but very hard to digest how a boy no older than 15 could have gone through so much tragedy.    The book comes to an abrupt end, but the meaning behind the ending is beyond moving. This book is incredible and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I had never heard anything about Veronica Mars or watched an episode until this box set went on sale on Amazon and I bought it. After guest starring on Heroes and starring in Pulse I soon fell in love with Kristen Bell and decided to give her show a shot. Ten minutes into the first episode I was hooked. I have never seen a detective show like this one before. This show is filled with great music (ex: The Dandy Warhols), has very different albeit appealing cinematography, the dialouge is fresh and witty and best of all it isn't just another teen soap opera. I was dissappointed later to find out that it only lasted for 3 seasons and after watching the last episode it was apparent the show's writers were not expecting to be cancelled and the last episode left too many questions unanswered. Veronica Mars has become one of my favorite shows and I have watched the 3 seasons many a times since purchasing it. I love that the main character is a strong and feisty girl who doesn't need to pull out \\"secret tae kwon do\\" moves to pull it off (like Alias or Buffy not that I don't love these shows too). This show is awesome and the writer's seemed to fight the network influence in controversial story lines that most good shows eventually suffer from (Buffy 4th season-lesbian storyline and O.C. season 3-Marissa Cooper in general). I think we should all get together and petition for a 4th Season because I can not get enough Veronica Mars.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|This film is all about the actors. The premise, or so it is called, is paper-thin. Any hallmark tv movie can beat that to it. Instead of devolving into a mundane murder mystery, this film adds a new dimension right from the beginning. Three childhood friends playing on the streets of their small provincial town nearly got absconded by two pedophiles in a car. One of them was not that lucky, Dave (adult role played by Tim Robbins).     Dave escaped four days later but was so traumatized by the event, he remained a \\"basket case\\" for the rest of his life. His wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden), being insecure and overly suspicious, didn't help matters either.     The Macguffin of this film which inevitably draws all three childhood friends together was the murder of Jimmy's (Sean Penn) 19 year old daughter, played by a pre-Phantom of the Opera Emmy Rossum. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is the investigating officer for the case. Somehow or rather, through a series of incredible coincidences, Dave became a prime suspect and...    I don't wish to spoil the ending. But for those who have seen the film, read on. In a way, all of the main characters contributed to Dave's death in the end. Although Jimmy was physically responsible, Celeste was indirectly responsible, for telling Jimmy about Dave, Sean and his Sergeant (a dominant Laurence Fishburne) for placing their suspicions on Dave. In a way, Dave is this sad little tragic Greek figure in a tragedy where fate has sealed his destiny and despite himself, he cannot save himself from the inevitable.    In closing, I would like to point out that Laura Linney's character deserved special mention. Even though, she barely had any screentime, 10 minutes or so, her last scene shared with Sean Penn, evoked such powerful emotions that she reminded me of Lady Macbeth, in a conniving manner, using subterfuge, she convinced Jimmy that what he had done (murdering Dave) was the right and moral thing to do, using reasons such as protecting his familyand domain as \\"what a king would do\\", those were her exact words. This was followed by a parade sequence where she and Marcia's character would exchange wordless glances that speaks all. The lady exults a sense of underlying evil and the capability to commit even more vileness that would surpass her husband's reckless cruelty.
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay gets some crap in more serious circles because of their sappiness and pandering to the mainstream, but at least on their debut album, they ain't bad.  At times singer Chris Martin's falsetto can get annoying, but in general he fits the tone he's creating, and while the lyrics are never as deep or touching as he seems to want them to be, they get the job done without being too egregious.  His piano playing can be a bit simple, but he can come up with simple tunes that are still effective and catchy.  The instrumentation isn't particularly important to their style, but their guitarist is competent at his job of keeping things lively and nothing about the rhythm is bad either.  Really, it's not bad music.  Stop making fun of me for listening to girl stuff.    Like a lot of albums that aren't great but aren't bad either, Parachutes starts stronger than it ends.  \\"Don't Panic\\" is short but lets you know what's up, with a nice, high pitched guitar line and pleasant vocals.  \\"Shiver\\" is one of the harder songs because of its thicker, distorted guitar, but hard is a relative term with this band.  \\"Spies\\" has an acoustic, slightly off-kilter sound, and it's pretty good at being something other than the love ballads they're known for.  \\"Yellow\\" is the single that got them noticed, and it's a bit simple, but still well-executed and an enjoyable song.  It's followed by \\"Trouble\\", with the nice piano and swelling chorus.  Martin's probably the most obnoxious sounding on this one, but it doesn't ruin the rest of the song.  There are some more songs afterward, they all follow the same pattern, neither painful to listen to nor really memorable.  The only reason I ever get mainstream stuff like this is because I find it cheap, but I can still gleam some fun out of it.
B000WQW988|5.0|The Nirvana unplugged concert on MTV is burned into my soul as one of my fondest memories of the 1990's. The song writing was brilliant and the sound was so raw.<br /><br />It's sad that such a peaceful, mellow, and talented era was replaced by a bunch of corporate lip syncing jokers. MTV barely even plays music anymore. Yeah, they had non-music stuff in the 1990's such as the rock and jock games, singled out with Jenny McCarthy, and Beavis and Butthead (but at least they had a music theme to them). Every show today on MTV is just an excuse to show half naked teenage girls, and promote a shallow lifestyle.
B000Q66HBE|5.0|All the songs are fun and addicting. There are some great melodies and nice solos. Great vocals. I highly reccomend for all kinds of metal fans. Also there are great videos.
B0001I561E|5.0|I actually saw this movie in the theater before I had children and I loved it then too! I would definitely recommend this movie for parents as well as children. Only Robin Williams could play a role like the genie and make him a hilarious part of the movie with great success! This should be labled a Disney Classic!
B00062RCBW|5.0|Great purchase. This was the international version (check user pics for detail pic), which kind of caught me off guard - because I did not look at the pics until after I received the order. All discs work great. And they come in a heavy wooden box that can double as a bludgeoning device if need be...    Made this trekkie happy =)
B0002858YS|4.0|Hot Fuss is a pretty good album, a nice merger of that modern style of critically acclaimed rock I honestly don't like that much with some synthetic touches. When vocalist Brandon Flowers actually sings, he has a pretty good voice, my only problem is that all too often he just sort of half-heartedly shouts the lyrics. The problem grows a bit when the songs seem as focused on the vocals as they often do. The rest of the band members, especially the guitarist, can be solid musicians, they just don't stand out that much. Most of the tracks do have something to like though, and it's enjoyable music as long as you don't try to read into it too much. The lyrics often don't make sense, but that's only ever a problem for me if they're painful to listen to, and these are just a bit odd. The Killers are probably their best when they aren't sounding like every other mainstream rock band.    \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" contains one of the only instances of enjoyable bass-playing on the album, as it intermingles with high-pitched keys and crashing guitars. \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is my favorite of the two singles, with it being catchier than \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and a bit less repetitive, although that's not a bad song either. \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" has a haunting and memorable synth part that drives the track, and helps make it one of the best. \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" is one of the more deliberate tracks, and isn't that entertaining besides an enjoyable detour with a choir repeating \\"I've got soul but I'm not a soldier\\". \\"On Top\\" is one of the more over-the-top techno sounding songs. As the album starts dragging, \\"Midnight Show\\" helps bring it back a bit, being pretty energetic and having a nice chorus. \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" ends it in strange style, a slow-paced, odd song that is nonetheless compelling as Flowers repeatedly wails the title. If you enjoyed the singles at all I'd recommend giving it a shot.
1592332803|4.0|Ok, let me start with the good stuff:     -Great recipe selection  -Easy-to-use layout and awesome indexes  -Wonderful tips and conversational text  -Well-constructed book with beautiful photos    However... the author uses WAY too much sugar.  I have reduced - usually by around half - the amount of sugar in almost every recipe I've tried, and I can't imagine how sickly sweet the results would be if I didn't.  This is coming from a girl who loves her desserts, too.    This is not a cookbook for someone looking for whole-grain dessert recipes or low-fat items (she uses 2 sticks of \\"butter\\" for 12 chocolate chip cookies), but she's very up-front that these are not concerns of hers when it comes to baking.  They are, however, concerns of mine, so with her recipes I generally cut out some of the fat, reduce the sugar, and replace at least half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat pastry flour. But with these changes... damn delicious.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|First off, as I can see in most reviews complaining about Corey's voice,  I'm actually baffled that none of you are aware that it was the band's extensive touring which caused his voice to sound hoarse, NOT the mask. Hell, I sound hoarse after singing along at a concert for just a couple of hours, so imagine having to do that for approx. 233 shows, and then see how good your voice would sound. As for the instruments, they couldn't sound better. I'm a Guitar player, so naturally I listen to the Guitar parts more closely than anything else, and I must say that they're incredibly thick, and heavy. Jim and Mick perform flawlessly. Everybody else sounds great as well.       As for the actual review.       I've never heard a live album where most of the songs are actually better than the originals before. Seriously, you have to hear some of the versions of songs featured on these discs. I'll post the highlights and compare them to the studio versions.    The Blister Exists - Heavier than the original, and in my opinion it's much better.     Sic - Played at a slightly slower tempo than the original, but like the previous song, it's much heavier.     Disasterpieces - This song is anything but a disasterpiece. Mick's lead Guitar parts are much louder than the album version, and they provide some great hooks.     Liberate - Corey's harsh vocals actually make this song better than the original, where his vocals weren't quite as good.    Vermilion - The band performs this song exceptionally well, but I do have a problem with Corey's vocals, as he sounds quite winded, and you can really tell in the verses. And the last minute or so the song goes off tempo a bit. Still a quality performance though.     Pulse of The Maggots - Much heavier than the original, and performed with loads of energy. Definitely better than original.     Purity - Even though this was never offically released on any album, it doesn't keep it from being one of my favorite 'Knot songs. Very eerie verses.On to disk two.    Skin Ticket - Slipknot never performed this song up until this point, and Corey stated that it might be a trainwreck, but it definitely wasn't.     Everything Ends - WAY better than original. In fact, this may be the best example of the live songs being better than the originals. Mick's lead parts were almost non-existent in the original since they were barely audible, but they're VERY audible here. Very good live re-endition indeed.    Spit it Out - Corey's voice makes this song what it is. Plus, it contains the \\"jumpdafucup\\" interlude. Too bad we can't see it though.     People = S#it - Very heavy, and performed with loads of energy. And the climax before the final chorus gives me the goosebumps.     Those are in my opinion the highlights of the two disc set. Take the advice of an actual Slipknot fan, and buy this set. It's fantastic.     Later, Maggots.
B000BO0LEU|4.0|Caveat:  I'm buying this product today, assuming that it matches the one I got from the library:  The Paper Bag Princess, 69 minutes, 1992.    I love this musical, animated version of the Paper Bag Princess!  I don't remember the book from childhood, so it doesn't bother me that the video doesn't match the book exactly.  The episode is about 25 minutes long.    The rest of the DVD is the 'bonus episode' of A Gift Of Munsch, which you can also buy separately.  It's basically a video of the author telling six stories to a live audience, which I wasn't thrilled with.  I like the stories, but I prefer them as books or animation.  This is why I'm giving it four stars instead of five.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I'm glad we got this.  The udpated color of the new movie on DVD is great.  The Kids enjoy the movie as much as we did when we were kids.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|The Black Parade is an attempt at a grandiose, operatic concept album; an emo epic.  Or is it?     The problem with emo is that everyone claims to hate it but no one seems to know what it actually is.  Everyone can identify an \\"emo kid\\" by his dopey haircut and the extreme angle of his myspace photo, but the only characteristic of the subgenre they can think of is a predilection for suicidal lyrics.  These ad hominem attacks rarely identify specific bands, instead relying on generic joke ones like Rip My Heart To Shreds or something.  One of the more commonly cited actual bands is My Chemical Romance, although their singer Gerard Way himself declares that his band is not emo, and he hates the music himself.  This begs the question: what are these bands creating all this music that everybody hates?  In the end, it doesn't matter what you want to label the makers of The Black Parade.  It is entertaining in parts and a little boring in others.  There's a lot of simple chord progression.  There are some ventures into older styles of rock, including noticeable influence from Queen.  There's a story in there somewhere about someone dying of cancer and what he leaves behind.  Most of the more interesting parts are a little over-the-top and perhaps beyond the honest reach of the band's abilities.  But if you can stomach the eccentricities, it's not a bad modern rock album.    The first track is \\"The End.\\"  It mixes soft strumming with loud parts as Way sings or shrieks as appropriate.  \\"Dead!\\" is a more normal song in line with what they've done before, although you see some of that influence from recent decades past.  \\"The Sharpest Lives\\" has a sharp, repetitive baseline that adds a bit of a metal feel while Way growls a bit to fit the mood.  Just a bit.  \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" is pretty outlandish, a typical pop-punk song wrapped inside a minimalistic piano ballad.  \\"I Don't Love You\\" delves more into their strength at writing simple but effective songs in their genre.  \\"Cancer\\" is a softer song that hits you over the head a bit before \\"Mama\\", another song that's perhaps artificially odd, with a calculated strangeness and a guest appearance by Liza Minnelli.  \\"Teenagers\\" is the purest retro track, and kind of doesn't fit in.  \\"Famous Last Words\\" has one last sweeping chorus before the hidden track \\"Blood\\", which is, again, a bit silly.  If you think you won't like this, you won't.  But there are some fun songs.
B000U7169M|1.0|*spoilers*<br /><br />*1/2<br /><br />Professor Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank) is some sort of professional miracle-debunker (ah, the things they provide government grant-money for these days) who is called to a small town in the Louisiana Bayou to investigate the claim that the water in the local river has mysteriously turned to blood.  Once an ordained minister but now an atheistic skeptic - a condition brought on by the death of her young daughter - Winter sets out to find a rational, scientific explanation for the phenomenon, only to discover, when she arrives there, that the town is indeed suffering from what appears to be a Biblical Ten Plagues redux.  Soon, frogs are falling from the sky, cattle are dying in the fields, food is becoming infested with maggots, boils are popping up on the citizenry, swarms of locusts are plaguing the town etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />\\"The Reaping\\" is another in a long line of Bible-inspired thrillers that are long on silliness and short on thrills.  With its largely incoherent, cobbled-together tale of prophecy fulfillment and ritualized child sacrifice, the movie manages to insult scientists, atheists, religious folk and rural Southerners - not to mention the intelligence of its audience - with just about equal fervor.  Not to worry, though, for the unbeliever - as is always the case in such films - has her religious faith miraculously restored to her in the end, although it comes with a mighty steep price as revealed in the story`s tiresomely \\"ironic\\" coda.<br /><br />All involved in this overwrought and undernourished fiasco seem to be phoning in their work, from the performers to the writers to the director to the special effects technicians.  As for Ms. Swank's appearance in this swill, all we can say is rarely has a two-time Oscar winner fallen this far.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|this cd is awesome, whoever thought to put these two together is a genius.  it's my favorite cd in my jazz collection.  george benson and al jarreau just keep getting better and better...i've been a fan of both for years.  bright shining stars in the american jazz scene.....
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|For those who read my signature you will notice after my name is the phrase, \\"Always an honest opinion.\\"  I decided from the time I wrote my very first review that I was going to honest with my readers even at the expense of ridicule (which is almost a guarante if one is honest). So With no further avail, here is my very honest/humble opinion of Michael Moore's documentary \\"Sicko\\".<br /><br />  My wife (who is as staunchly conservative as I am) makes it a point to see every Michael Moore documentary. I think she wants to understand opposing view points, but I'm not convinced she may in fact like to torture herself. So there I was the other night with emesis basin in hand preparing for yet another nauseating evening of Michael Moore. However, A couple hours later we both looked at each other and said, \\"He actually made a couple good points in this film.\\" 1) The fact that medical and drug companies have in the past and will continue in the future to purchase or representatives on both sides of the aisle (both Republicrats and Demacans). 2)There are some Health organizations in this country that are trying to refuse claims they should be paying in order to make bigger and bigger profits. 3) He was very critical of the Bush Medicare bill that was signed a few years ago, which incidentally many free thinking conservatives like Michael Savage were critical of as well (it really only benefit's the health organizations and pharmaceutical organizations while costing us billions). 4) Moore showed how our government has failed to help 9/11 rescue workers with health ailments that occurred due to their involvement in the rescue mission. Volunteer or not that's crap!!!<br /><br />Here's the BAD BAD BAD of the film: Moore being a trumpeter for communist health care without giving a REAL account of the cost of such a system. He blatantly shows only the perceived \\"benefits\\" of such a system without showing the negative effects of it. No mention of the fact that people who are dying in Canada often come to the U.S. to get an emergency MRI (for example) they would have to wait months for in Canada. I read about one story  where a guy checked himself into a veterinarians office as Fido to get an MRI he could take back to Canada (Savage, The enemy within). Also Mr. Moore played right into Castro's hand by bringing 9/11 rescue workers to Guantanamo Bay. He kept talking over a load speaker that he just wanted them to allow these 9/11 rescue workers to receive the same care they give Al-Quida. He then took them into Cuba where they of course received top notch medical treatment (ya Castro had nothing to do with that. Right, no political gain there for Castro to allow that. No not at all.)  Then there was the fact that Mr. Moore had a huge, glowing review of Hillary Clintons efforts for nationalized healthcare. To his credit he also revealed that  her campaign now accepts money from these same healthcare organizations she once fought in her efforts to nationalize healthcare (doesn't that make her hypocrite Clinton). However, by far the worst offense for me was to see him in front of a Karl Marx statue (a little bit of emesis came up into my mouth at that point) in reverence to his great hero. I kid you not, this guy was standing in front of a monument of sorts to Karl Marx (it might have been his grave).  He then goes off on this diatribe of how we have socialized programs in America already (police, fire) and how we shouldn't fear socialized programs. I could go on and on. However, I don't want to sicken my fellow conservatives by subjecting you to too much communist propaganda.<br /><br />Conclusion: I honestly feel this film is worth seeing. Not only will you have no doubt in your mind that Moore is a blatant socialist (he stands in respect at Karl Marx's tomb for God sake) , but you will learn that we do indeed need to make some drastic improvements to our current system. The real argument isn't that the current system is broken, but by what means should we go about fixing it. I don't feel socialized medicine is the answer.<br /><br />I debated between 2 and 3 stars. I'll give him 3 stars for trying to be a little less indoctrinating in this film.bout fixing it. I don't feel socialized medicine is the answer.                              I debated between 2 and 3 stars. I'll give him 3 stars for trying to be a little less indoctrinating in this film.
B000W1V5VU|4.0|Sometimes a movie is made JUST to entertain (gasp!), and entertain it did. Plot weaknesses, yes, but overall it was slick, fun, and I didn't have to ponder over the subtle, sub-text meaning when I left the theatre.  I just left smiling.....oh,I wouldn't be doing the movie justice if I didn't mention the eye-candy aspect for women of all ages!!!
0143038419|1.0|I couldn't get through the first thirty pages of this book either. A year after I gave up on it (not just gave up, but was utterly exhausted, irritated, and distressed by it) the author is on Oprah in a room full of women who call \\"Eat Pray Love\\" their bible. I logged on to find out if I'm the only person who found Elizabeth Gilbert to be, well, self-absorbed, self-obsessed, afraid of her own company, unable to see outside of her own drama. I am relieved to have found so many similar reviews. It makes me sad that women cling to this book as some kind of instruction manual on how to find rightness in their lives. P.S. Ms. Gilbert makes the same impression on Oprah as she did in the book.
0143038419|5.0|Eat,Pray, Love, is exceptional! Having a life interrupted by a sticky divorce, falling for the dreaded non-committed rebound boyfriend, and adding twenty-five pounds, this could have been my story. Liz takes the painful, unforgiving, feelings of truth to the ultimate expression of frustration, taking life personally and trying to find peace during the process. The book is written as if she's talking to you about her deepest secrets, like a girl friend, confiding in her best friend, sharing her wild side and tender observations about life's checks and balances. I laughed out loud through my tears. The metaphysical gems are abundant and help to rationalize logical & mystical answers to life's perplexing occurances. This is one of the best books's I've read in a few years and I learned we are all just human, striving to be divine. Via \\"Attraversiamo Baby\\"!
B000VBJEEG|1.0|I was STOLEN with this stupid DVD. It doesn't have Spanish audio or subtitles. ONLY ENGLISH. Amazon says it is DOUBLED, but that is not true. If you like to see movies with Spanish audio, don't buy this.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|My friends and I were big Yardbirds fans and loved blues, so we picked this LP up when it first came out way back when. Shortly thereafter, not to be outdone, Jimmy Page released the first Led Zep album, which interestingly enough contained HIS version of the classic \\"You Shook Me\\", which Beck had featured on \\"Truth\\". We listened to and wore out several copies of \\"Truth\\". Everything about it is great. No one talks about the visual quality of the cover: a sea of lustrous, rich ebony with tasteful powder blue lettering in a no-nonsense font, arty-looking image manipulation of a paint-smattered beauty. Don't know the origin or the meaning but I like it.<br />This was the stuff Stewart was meant to sing; it contains some of the best work he's ever done--listen to \\"Blues Deluxe\\" and \\"Rock My Plimsoul\\". Beck demonstrates why he was and is one of the most innovative guitarists ever, not easily pigeonholed into any one category. Soaring and blistering on Beck's Bolero, subtle and wonderfully understated on \\"Greensleeves\\", and everything in between.<br />We caught the band live at the Labor Temple in Minneapolis in about 1969. Does anyone recall this besides me? The PA system was f*cked up and Stewart couldn't do what he wanted to do, so they did a lot of instrumentals, which was fine with all of us. This was Ron Wood on bass, Mick Waller (the little guy with short hair and wire rims) on drums, Stewart and Beck. What a great band!<br />\\"Truth\\" captures them pretty well. A true landmark album. Play it loud.
0375842381|5.0|I am writing to review the series `His Dark Materials' by Phillip Pullman - I read them in the same hardcover version sold here as a box set, before they were boxed. They are beautiful books, the same size as the large paperbacks, and `The Amber Spyglass' has a beautiful library binding style cover (glossy boards with illustration) and a rather delicate dust jacket - be careful not to tear the circle. This injury seems common with this book.    I have seen the movie `The Golden Compass' and I found it utterly satisfying, and wonderful.  I read these books two or three years ago.  I found them captivating books for young readers that also seemed to have a lot to offer adults.  I never really took much notice of the religious themes in this book, preferring to see the `Magisterium' as a stand-in for any totalitarian organization - religious, political or otherwise.  I know that, with the movie coming out at Christmastime, there is already a great degree of (I feel unfounded) controversy about the so-called `anti-christian' themes of these books.   Other reviewers on Amazon - many of whom have never reviewed anything, let alone another young person's book - have taken up the call to paint these books as some kind of `campaign for atheism', and to name the prime campaigner Phillip Pullman.  It shouldn't be hard to discern from a review if the reviewer has actually read the book, and with most of these strongly negative reviews of `His Dark Materials' it's easy to see that the reviewers have not. It seems that a lot of talk and blather is being bandied about.  If you are inclined to read these books, read them for what they are: a very well written fantasy trilogy for young people, not for what fearful antagonists claim them to be: an atheist's primer and attack on God and religious faith.    I want to review these books mostly from a fiction perspective, but it's very tempting to answer some of the false claims that some reviewers make in ignorance of the actual story.`The Golden Compass' opens the series by introducing us to a world kind of like our own, where some of the place names are the same, but the people are different in at least one striking way: they are all accompanied by a companion animal we soon learn to interpret as their soul.  This arrangement makes life distinctly different in some ways. The animal companions can play together, children's companions can change their form, and there are taboos about touching the companion animals of others.    The story really begins when a mysterious figure appears before the board at Oxford, to show evidence he's found for the existence of other worlds, linked by metaphysical `dust' that has some of the qualities we ascribe to quantum particles in our science.  The Magisterium has forbidden any mention or study of Dust, proclaimed it heresy, and condemned those who express an interest.  As Lyra, the heroine of the series begins to follow the path of her destiny, she deals with themes of `Truth', the innocence of children, control, loyalty and betrayal.  She meets and either befriends or battles various tribes of Scholars, Religious officials, Tartars, Armored Bears, Gypsy-like people called Gyptians, century old witches and abducted children.  As the series progresses, travels to parallel worlds, and meets her male counterpart - a boy named Will, who will help her in countless ways as she continues onward, under edict from the church, pursued by a high assassin who himself has already been absolved of her murder before he commits it,   The stakes in this story become incredibly high, with Lyra's constant capture, escape and recapture, and the coming storm of conflict draws people of many races from several worlds, as well as from the ranks of angels, into a war fever-pitched cyclone with Will and Lyra in it's center.  Help comes in unexpected forms from other children, angels, lost souls, dragonfly riders, a resourceful anthropologist who befriends the children, and of course giant armored polar bears.    This series is dramatic, dark, and stirring.  Expect young readers to make favorable comparisons to Harry Potter.  If anything, the emotions run higher as the stakes get larger in this series than they do for the young wizards in the Rowling series.  For comparison I also offer Lemony Snicket, the Life of Pi, and C.S. Lewis.  Admittedly the Narnia books are at the opposite end of the religious spectrum from His Dark Materials, but they are similar in their greatness, drama, and sense of high purpose.  Another book that was once commonly handed to young readers is George Orwell's 1984   The anti-authoritarian message in His Dark Materials speaks out against oppression in a very similar manner to Orwell.  In Lyra's world, the oppressive (fictional) organization is not a totalitarian government, it's the church. It's a story, and the author can go with it where he wants. In this world, God (actually the primary angel) ends up wearing the rectangular black mustache.  It's not wrong, it's just fiction.  I would even go so far as to say, in spite of what various church officials say about these books and films, that these books fit on the same shelf with the Narnia books.  I think they'll inspire the same quality of thoughtfulness' and feeling.      Part of this story - near the end, treats the subject of first love.  If a reader has reached this part of the story, they are probably exhausted, because the level of intensity required just to see our main characters through to the end is unparalleled in much of fiction.  I bring this up only because there are claims that these books have inappropriate sexual content. I don't believe so.     There is no overt sexual content.  There are short passages in the end of the series which are open to interpretation, but would likely be interpreted by an adult who already has sexual experience as being about sexual experience. For a younger reader, these scenes would be much more in the realm of hintand intimation. They are scenes about falling in love and enjoying the physical presence of the object of your love, and having strong sensations and feelings associated with that experience.  In my opinion this is more healthy for young readers than harmful. More accurate and honest information about the feelings of romance than you'd find if what you knew about sex, you learned from the internet. I'm sure Judy Blume might agree.    Organized religions of all stripes will object to this work of fiction, because it paints the church as a horribly corrupted and evil institution, and the 'Authority' that the church worships as malign, controlling and cruel angel, who proclaims himself as God, in the absence of an active or actual God.  I say if you are a young reader of dramatic stories, you should just let those organized religion people sweat a little, and read as you see fit.  Let them see that you can read stories that scare the heck out of them, and still turn out to be an alright person who can be sensible about your own beliefs and religious faith. They may be scared, but they won't break. Neither will you, or your faith, if you read an enriching fantasy series.  It doesn't hurt, if you believe in God, to know that the writer Phillip Pullman doesn't. I don't think anything in these books is intended to change your views or faith, but even if it were, I don't think it could, and I don't think you will notice anything like this in reading these stories.    Lastly,  The main thing about this series that will stick with you is the ending.  It is a fine ending, bright and beautiful, but not a fluffy happy ending. It draws a great deal of emotion from the happenings of the story out to a fitting close, but it also introduces the world in a real, harsh, adult light. Things don't end perfectly, they end with the fierce dictates of fate, and some very real heartache.  This is really the `absolute moment' of the series, deeply emotional, and unforgettable.  I have no doubt that any young person reading this series will ever forget this ending.  It will scar them. Not in a way that will make them licentious, or atheist, or even resentful of authority. It will scar them in the good way you want children's fiction to mark children - they way that the loss of Old Yeller, or Black Beauty scarred you older readers; the way C.S. Lewis's Prince Caspian marked you, or the fall of Gandalf wounded you as a young reader, giving more reality to the world by shedding some light on Its reality through use of fiction.  I can give these books a heart felt recommendation, and say they are destined to become unforgettable classics, you will have to sort out any controversy you encounter - Let your heart race with the contours of the story, not over the anger and upset of critics who don't read the books.
0765348780|1.0|250 pages in and I'm done. The book is so poorly written it is all but unreadable. Here's a sample: \\"Crokus shared something of the tower's imagined sardonic reserve for the pretense so rife in Majesty Hall, an emotion of his uncle's that had seeped into the lad over the years.\\"     Huh? Say that twice fast. What is this sentence even about? The whole book is like this. It's beyond me how anybody can read thousands of pages of this stuff. The writing (and reading!) would be greatly improved simply by crossing out every adjective and simile. Not to mention each and every instance of \\"imagined sardonic reserve\\".

B000U618C8|4.0|I have to admit, I bought his cd's because I am attending a music festival in australia first weekend of the year which he will be at and I have to say I'm suprised. Although its quite mellow and José's strange melodic voice floats through the tracks, there is something familiar to it, comforting or even nostalgic.    Not everyones choice, but I recommend if you've listened to him before and liked what you heard.
B000002O4X|5.0|I love John Barry's music and this is some of his very best. It's beautiful and so easy to listen to whether as background music or for it's own sake. If you've seen the movie, I guarantee you'll replay it in your mind each time, as you listen. It's music you'll listen to over and over and still never tire of.
B000W1V5VU|4.0|I loved Ocean's 11 and I liked Ocean's 12. Ocean's 13 was not that great. First off the premise itself was a little over the top - it is one thing planning a heist, another to plan a heist with every table, every slot winning and the house losing (no, I am not giving out any secrets here). This is an ambitious attempt (daring?), but then everything seems to fall in place so easy. And it just doesn't have the same feel of thrill, suspense, excitement whatever. Good for a watch, but not much more.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I am a physician, living in the USA but originally from the United Kingdom. I have much to say about this documentary which I saw last night but I will not divulge into political bashing in public (just yet...) To start, I have to say I have not been so passionately shaken, moved, broken-down and reinvogorated (all these feelings!) as a doctor since I first dreamt of the idea of becoming one, and even then, I was too young to experience the feelings I went through watching this.<br /><br />Now I am not here to discuss Michael Moore as a person, nor will I discuss what I think of particular aspects of the American Health Care System overall, since it has both advantages and disadvantages like any other system today, regardless of how severe or imbalanced these may be. What I wish to discuss is my experience watching the documentary and I will say that I had always thought Michael Moore's films represent the \\"other extreme\\", if you like, and you should watch with caution. I can safely say today though, that in this particular instance, facts are facts and whether portrayed by Michael Moore or any other person, the problems discussed are real. Every person needs to be aware of them, if only to know them and be aware of their existence, even if one agrees with the system or disagress and chooses to do nothing about it.<br /><br />There were many valid points raised in the film and these truthfully represent the foundation of this powerful documentary. In addition, Michael Moore proved to have done a nice thing at the end of the film and just for that little gesture, I like him better for this (I never hated him mind you).<br /><br />A note of caution however, and I wish Michael expanded on that a little and here is what I mean by watch carefully and make your mind up after learning as much of the truth there since this is another extreme. When in Britain, he interviewed a GP (general practitioner or family doctor) who so happened to have reaped the benefits of the health system from the government there. GP's have made the most out of the British government in wages, working hours, incentives and much more, which they may well have deserved. However, this is not the truth of what a hospital doctor's life out there is like. It is somehow less rosey, with doctors being harder worked, with few incentives and unfortunately, easily replaced in a socialist system which cannot afford its own doctors who help maintain the standard of care, despite not being overpaid (and paid much less than the GP you saw yesterday). There have been many redundancies, including great surgeons and doctors who have been forced to seek employment abroad (and incidentally and not surprisingly were quickly taken on by other sensible health care systems). Waiting lists have been the main target for the government, and their reduction has only come at a cost in standard of care delivered to the patients. In reducing these lists, there was no finicial gain. However, political gain was and is huge, and may be even worse than overt financial benefit since patients are decevied of this using political 'spin' and propaganda.<br /><br />The French system is also truly the best health care system, but clearly France cannot afford what it has been providing to its population and hence the reason for the uprise of riots and strikes that have paralyzed the nation when the government realised that and attempted to cut into a portion of the generous pension schemes offered.<br /><br />All systems have disadvantages, but yes, you would not be left to suffer as an emergency in the street in Britain or France, and yes that may be more important than any other aspect of health care. That, you can decide.<br /><br />Regardless, I was immensely moved and most importantly reinvigorated in a new passion to help the sick and do all I can for individuals who need my help. Helpless and desperate individuals as I stand upon them with the solution, cure and knowledge in my own two hands. Nothing will stop ME from delivering the cure. I would give my life as quickly as I would the drugs to help these individuals, such was my sorrow for them. That I have re-sworn to do after watching this and if for reminding me of that alone.... I give this documentary a 5/5.<br /><br />My comments on health insurance companies is not needed, I can leave that to your imagination.I would give my life as quickly as I would the drugs to help these individuals, such was my sorrow for them.

BY day, a criminologist (CSI) who specializes in blood spatter, by night (or whenever he feels the need for justice), a serial killer!<br /><br />In the beginning of season one we get to see what lead up to his interesting profession, a loving foster mother & father. The father realizes Dexter has a \\"problem\\" early on when he found a bothersome dog that Dexter had killed, along with other remains, that to this point have yet to be explained.<br /><br />His sister also works in the police dept. in vice and is trying to work her way up the corporate ladder.<br /><br />Dexter seems to have incredible insights into murder (and who should know better than one who has spilt the blood than one who has actually done it!?!) He seems to want his sister to work her way up the ranks especially while she works in the vice squad and a serial killer starts killing off hookers in the greater Miami area. Dexter wants to help her, but also wants her to build her own confidence, as his insight tells him that she can figure it out by herself, and with a little help she does start to work her way up... kind of...<br /><br />A \\"Must See\\" for adults (more gruesome, or about as much as CSI, so not for the kiddies, or even teens) and a LOT more twisted!<br /><br />If you like CSI, then you'll LOVE Dexter! He's a cleaver guy who worked his way up the ranks by killing those such as pesky child rapists/killers at the beginning, and it only gets more interesting when the serial killer seems to be onto him and starts leaving him clues in his apartment and in other places... It has you wondering if his father, sister, or even his \\"girlfriend\\" (for lack of better terms - he doesn't do well in social situations!) might have something to do with what going on, even though his father is apparently dead already, but then they tell you that his mother was murdered (but no mention of how daddy died!)<br /><br />If you like \\"Who done it\\" type flicks, you'll LOVE this, as it keeps you wondering exactly what the heck is going on!

0143038419|5.0|Since this is an easier review after writing 150+ it will be modified! When I realized that I'm likely one of the few men to have read this very beautiful writing, I will be surprised to see any response!     I am deeply impressed by her intro into Yogic Mantra, of which the first one is being \\"OM Namah-Shivaya.\\" The second one is even simpler and more available, Hamm-Sah.\\" I am now becoming a convinced Yoga Habit! Those several places where I was challenged to slow down and practise them first appear in Book One of Italy Tale No. 7. After introducing \\"OM Hamah-Shivaya,\\" She attributes both these mantra from the Sanskrit, which her Guru translates, \\"I honor the divinity that resides within me.\\"    That was the point when she decided to soon travel to India and visit at least four months in the Ashram. But then she became friends with Luca Spaghetti. She already had become enamored with Italian Pasta, whenever she went to visit the beautiful Italian Piazza Navona, honoring the four great rivers of Planet Earth. Her favorite city in Italy was Rome. When she landed for a few days in Bologna, Florence and Venice, more Pasta... Next Sicily. In Tale No. 27, about her one day's visit to Naples she tells of meeting three young people, one an Australian. Each is traveling with backpack all over Europe. This is when she discovers that she is rapidly gaining weight!     My favorite part is Book II, the lovely time comes within the Indian Ashram. Her 36 Tales entitled \\"Congratulations to Meet You,\\" meaning as about \\"The Persuit of Devotion.\\" In her entrance in the Ashram she enters her very first practise of Yoga.     In the Tales of Numbers 45, 50, 51 & 57, she decides that \\"Devotion is diligence without assurance.\\" Here in the book, I came to the conclusion, she is one remarkable writer. She decides to follow her Guru's suggestion to practice Vipassana meditation! That night as mosquitoes began to gather, she had to sit in complete stillness all during dusk on the bench of the Ashram Gardens in the Yogic position. Rather than slapping and gripping at the mosquitoes, she followed her Guru's instruction to become the \\"scientist of her own inner experience!\\" She finally came to discover that she could sit thru that nonlethal physical discomfort to subdue her feelings of emotional discomfort: jealousy, anger, fear, shame, disappointment, loneliness, and boredom!      At first I felt that her freely using off-color stories and bursts of tough words were too offensive. Then I came to think...\\"maybe she had added them for a bit of spice.\\" When I finally finished her story, I was more satisfied with her ending.    Today, Elizabeth Gilbert appeared on OPRAH with audience of readers of her book. They included Richard of Texas who was her helpful friend from the Indian Ashram and her Mother both sitting on the front row! Once again my own inner spirit was inspired by her stillness of listening to the audience stories. It became apparent her favorite answers of response were \\"quietness, presence, Divine Perfection, absolute consciousness, and humility.\\"       Finally, I have found another \\"Life-Changing Book with which to linger awhile.\\" Retired Chaplain, Fred W Hood

B00005JPLW|3.0|I've been a BIG fan of this movie ever since it hit theaters, and as soon as the 2-disc special edition DVD became available, I intended to buy it right away. Unfortunately, my finances weren't where I thought they'd be at the time, so when it came out I simply added it to my shopping list and decided to bide my time. My patience paid off, because at one point Amazon was selling this for seven bucks (presumably a Black Friday deal) -- and when I saw that, I bought it immediately, before the price could shoot back up. And thank goodness I did, because if I had paid a penny more for this incredibly disappointing package, I would have been VERY upset.<br /><br />For starters, the DVD I got in the mail did not come with the cardboard packaging that the same 2-disc edition has when I've seen it in retail stores. I'm not sure if that's because Amazon felt that seven bucks didn't cover the price of cardboard, or if maybe that should be a signal to me that the DVD I received isn't actually brand new. Since the disc plays with no problems, I can live with that if it isn't, and I have no problem saving a tree -- but I'll always have to wonder what exactly it is that I paid for.<br /><br />The main problem is that this is simply one of the worst \\"special edition\\" DVD releases I've ever seen. There aren't enough extras to justify a second disc, by any means. Everything they give you could have fit easily onto a single disc. And \\"everything\\" consists of two rather short features about the graphic novel, the movie's relation to actual history, and the making of the film.<br /><br />The people who put this DVD together missed a VERY valuable opportunity to really give us an in-depth look at how the unique and often stunning visuals in this movie were created. I was eager to see some of the scenes before computer effects were added, and to watch more in-depth interviews with the cast and crew about the process of putting together this highly entertaining film. Instead, the most in-depth feature offered here is a handful of webisodes that were ALL available online BEFORE the movie was released in theaters!! It's a good bet that anyone who likes the movie enough to have purchased the 2-disc \\"special\\" edition would have taken the time to see these online already. And even if you're behind the curve a bit, chances are they're still floating around on YouTube some place. That's not to say it isn't nice having them on DVD, but they are no substitute for real content. And more to the point, NONE of these features are worth the normal retail price of this DVD -- in fact, they're barely worth the seven bucks that I paid for it. One feature in particular is almost unbearable. It's called \\"The Making of 300 In Images\\" and it's literally just a lot of image flashes with some crappy music that go by so quickly that watching it gave me a headache. I would SERIOUSLY recommend that you skip out on this feature if you suffer from epilepsy. I watched it in slow motion, but it was still useless because no one is explaining what exactly is going on in each batch of images.<br /><br />And most damning of all, THERE ARE NO TRAILERS INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE. Considering how much attention the trailers for \\"300\\" got, it's ludicrous that they're not here. Not only are they fantastic to watch on their own, but I believe they're the main reason this film was so successful.  People like me who aren't into reading graphic novels and had never heard of Frank Miller before \\"Sin City\\" came out aren't going to be pulled into paying for a movie like this without a fantastic trailer to motivate us. Heck, even my mother wanted to see this movie after she saw the trailer, and she hates violent action movies. So why isn't it here??? I couldn't tell you. All I know is that no matter how much you like this movie, you're better off buying the single-disc edition and saving yourself some money. Thank goodness I only paid seven bucks for my copy! If you can find a similar bargain, then by all means, take advantage. But the bottom line is that a movie this great deserves a better DVD presentation than this, and until they come up with one I suggest you avoid this like the plague itself.But the bottom line is that a movie this great deserves a better DVD presentation than this, and until they come up with one I suggest you avoid this like the plague itself.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|I remember it vividly. It was the summer of 1987, probably August, and I was standing in the HMV Megastore in Oxford Street in London browsing through their CD racks looking for something else to punish my long-suffering credit card with. Back then the 'video' was king. I mean the buggers were everywhere. MTV had them on rotation on our television sets at home all day and the more elaborate and expensive ones even made the news. 1987 was a year when a pop video was given as much credence as the release of the album it was promoting. And HMV was no different. The flagship shop had loads of black TV monitors hanging out of their Oxford Street ceiling covering every square inch of floor space in their huge new store. So I'm standing there in this busy Megastore browsing like everyone else. And then it happened.<br /><br />On came the new U2 video for \\"Where The Streets Had No Name\\". It was filmed in California on top of a building with the band playing live without announcement while American street goers below simply stopped in their tracks and looked up in amazement. And so did we. We all stopped and we all looked up in amazement. It was the only time I've ever seen this. The entire music store stopped and looked up at the TV monitors - hooked instantly by this incredible song and this dog's bollox of a band. The tune creeps in - building, building, building - then it bursts out of the speakers with this stunning chiming trailblazing guitar work and Bono's impassioned growl and lyrics. It was mesmerizing. I remember looking around me and noticing people's smiling faces. No one was browsing anymore. And I remember thinking - my God - they really have hit the Global zeitgeist with this. And it wasn't just that I was a Dubliner and therefore proud of 'our' band - this was different - in 1987 U2 really was dripping brilliance and 'everyone' knew it.<br /><br />So what's this jaunt back down memory lane got to do with this re-issue? The answer is 'wonder'. The same thing I felt all those years ago in that megastore is 'back'. Because this reissue folks, is truly one of the best I've ever heard or seen - a genuine 'wow' in every sense of the word. And one that fans will thrill too.<br /><br />\\"The Joshua Tree\\" was released globally in March 1987 and after 4 albums of escalating brilliance, U2 finally hit their penultimate moment - even the album's outtakes put out as B-sides on the singles were undeniably good. But the album on the relatively new format of compact disc was disappointingly dull and this magical record has remained in `dullard' sound-land ever since. There have been re-masters of some of the tracks on \\"Best Of 1980-1990\\" of course and the more recent \\"18 Singles\\" set, but this 20th Anniversary Edition Remaster issued globally on Monday 3 December 2007 is the first time in 20 years that the `entire' album has received a total overhaul and the sound quality and presentation is beautifully realised. The sound especially is just GORGEOUS.<br /><br />Here's the lay of the land; the CD comes in 3 variants:<br />The 1st is a standard CD in one of the new round-corner hard jewel cases and presents the 11 tracks of the original album in newly remastered form. There are no bonus tracks, but there is an upgraded booklet. It sells for around £10.<br /><br />The 2nd issue is housed in a gatefold digipak much like the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" issues from Universal or Zeppelin's recently issued \\"Mothership\\" set. The 2nd bonus disc gathers up all of the B-sides from the Album's single releases (7 tracks), track 8 is the single edit of \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", track 9 is the Sun City Version of \\"Silver & Gold\\" which features Keith Richards and Ron Wood of The Rolling Stones  - and last but not least, a juicy 5 new unreleased `outtakes\\" from the album. Disc 2 has a total of 14 in all. This 2CD version sells for £20 or £22 or £18 online - depending where you buy it.<br /><br />But the 3rd issue, the one I've bought this morning (dayof release) is a deluxe edition of 3 discs and is a limited edition. It's the issue I would recommend. It costs £27 (I didn't see any price difference in any store - except that it's available online for £22 in some places with free p&p). And it really is gorgeous - pricey for sure - but a genuine peach for fans.  The box itself is DVD sized but deeper inside; it has 3 gatefold card sleeves, the album in one, the bonus audio CD of 14 tracks in another and a 3rd, which is a bonus DVD. The DVD contains an 18-track July 1987 concert filmed in Paris, which is new, the \\"Outside Is America\\" documentary, an alternate video for \\"With Or Without You\\" and a rarely seen video of \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\". At over two and a half hours, it's a truly fantastic bonus.<br /><br />I'm also tempted to buy the new vinyl version because it's been put onto 2LPs and not squashed onto one. The pressing run will be limited and will almost certainly become a collectable within months.<br /><br />PACKINGING: All 3 CDs are in housed in gatefold card sleeves. The album has the same artwork of course, but the Bonus Audio CD and DVD discs feature Anton Corbijn's photo outtakes from The Joshua Tree sessions. It means that visually all three match - a nice touch. The 5 DVD sized Photographic Prints from the same sessions are housed in an embossed \\"Joshua Tree' symbol envelope and are nice, but a bit superfluous. The hardback book of 56-pages, however, is just gorgeous. There's all the lyrics from the album with singles pictured alongside their release dates, essays from all the key people around the album, the boys themselves, Daniel Lanois, Anton Corbijn, Steve Averill, Brian Eno and others. There are unpublished photographs, detailed production/reissue credits and even Allen Ginsberg's \\"America\\" poem reproduced at the end (one of the outtakes uses it). The whole shebang is lifted out of its recesses by a black ribbon. Classy. Some people have complained that £27 is excessive - money for old rope so to speak - but that kind of misses the point. The album has always deserved Rolls Royce treatment and now it finally gets it. The Deluxe edition is without question the one to buy for lovers of the album.<br /><br />SOUND: First up is the album itself. The Edge has supervised the tape transfers with remastering, production and engineering credits going to Arnie Acosta of Bernie Grundman Mastering and production by Cheryl Engels of Partial Productions. And a bang up job they've all done too. The difference in quality is astonishing. The original LP ran to just over 50 minutes, a lot for that format, and the last track on Side 1 always suffered for that. \\"Running To Stand Still\\" is now spectacular - worth the price of admission alone. I'm hearing new sounds both during and at the end of this beautiful and overlooked gem. Similarly, \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\", \\"In God's Country\\" and \\"One Tree Hill\\" leap out of the speakers instead of limping. And if this isn't good enough, the album's finisher, the haunting \\"Mothers Of The Disappeared\\" now has absolutely extraordinary power - Eno's swirling and crashing soundscapes matching Bono's touching and heartfelt lyrics - it's magnificent and immensely moving - even after two decades of familiarity. All of these U2 tracks have been screaming out for sonic upgrades for years and this muscular re-mastering of them does not disappoint.<br /><br />I've had the B-sides on original 1987 UK CD singles for years, but they are ordinary sounding like the original CD album. They too have been beefed up - they're now warm, clear and full of life. Very enjoyable rehearing them. A small point worth making is this. The supposed 2nd CD single here in the UK \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" has eluded my grasp for 20 years - I'm still not sure it exists. It's always documented in the band's British discography and presumed it's out there - but I've NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN ONE?? So the inclusion of its 2 rare B-sides here is welcome. Thefive new out-takes as you can imagine are a mixed bag, some good, some iffy - and obvious in most cases why they were relegated to the vaults.  But as a rabid fan of the album, I'm grooving to them more and more. The lyrics to one of them, \\"Wave Of Sorrow (Birdland)\\", is even in the hardback book.<br /><br />The DVD is not in 5.1 Surround, but it still sounds and looks amazing. Filmed at The Hippodrome de Vincennes in Paris on the 4th of July 1987, it shows the band in full flight - and they were just electrifying - on fire. Some mellow tracks like \\"October\\" and \\"MLK\\" also get rare outings here too - superb. The band then hits the crowd with an absolutely lethal triple whammy of \\"In God's Country\\", \\"Electric Co.\\" and \\"Bad\\". The Edge's playing during \\"Electric Co.\\" is simply hair-raising - and I swear - at moments during the song - they were simply the best band on the planet! Also towards the end of the song, a \\"huge\\" bare-chested male French fan is lifted up onto the stage; he in turn lifts Bono up into his arms and Bono then adds \\"Break On Through\\" by The Doors onto the end of the blistering \\"Electric Co\\". The crowd went wild!<br /><br />To sum up: the album is remastered to spectacular effect, the bonus CD of B-sides and outtakes is never less than fantastic and the DVD simply the visual icing on top of an extraordinary cake. When you think that June 2007 has passed without a 40th Anniversary appreciation of \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" by The Beatles and November 2007 without a 35th Anniversary Edition of Zeppelin's \\"Four Symbols\\" - at least those at Universal and Island have had the brains not to miss this masterpiece's 20th Anniversary.<br /><br />Whatever way you cut it, this is an exceptional re-issue of one of 'the' great albums of our times - and with the weeks bleeding into 2008, not a moment too soon. A thing of wonder indeed. U2 are of course millionaires now - way too big for their britches - way too mouthy - and spend way too much of their time pissing about with hotel properties - when they should be pissing 'in' hotel properties and generally vandalizing them like proper rock stars do. Still, back then, they had 'magic' coming out of their ears. Idealism, love, deserts, slappin' em down and The Edge's cool hat - it's all in there. \\"Get involved in the fight...\\" they told us in the liner notes to the album. Join Amnesty International and Greenpeace they urged - and swept away by the glorious positivity of it all - many of us did. What a band - what a landmark record.<br /><br />\\"...I want to reach out...and touch the flame...\\" he sang. And now we can.s always deserved Rolls Royce treatment and now it finally gets it. The Deluxe edition is without question the one to buy for lovers of the album.       SOUND: First up is the album itself. The Edge has supervised the tape transfers with remastering, production and engineering credits going to Arnie Acosta of Bernie Grundman Mastering and production by Cheryl Engels of Partial Productions. And a bang up job they've all done too. The difference in quality is astonishing. The original LP ran to just over 50 minutes, a lot for that format, and the last track on Side 1 always suffered for that. \\"Running To Stand Still\\" is now spectacular - worth the price of admission alone. I'm hearing new sounds both during and at the end of this beautiful and overlooked gem. Similarly, \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\", \\"In God's Country\\" and \\"One Tree Hill\\" leap out of the speakers instead of limping. And if this isn't good enough, the album's finisher, the haunting \\"Mothers Of The Disappeared\\" now has absolutely extraordinary power - Eno's swirling and crashing soundscapes matching Bono's touching and heartfelt lyrics - it's magnificent and immensely moving - even after two decades of familiarity. All of these U2 tracks have been screaming out for sonic upgrades for years and this muscular re-mastering of them does not disappoint.      I've had the B-sides on original 1987 UK CD singles for years, but they are ordinary sounding like the original CD album. They too have been beefed up - they're now warm, clear and full of life. Very enjoyable rehearing them. A small point worth making is this. The supposed 2nd CD single here in the UK \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" has eluded my grasp for 20 years - I'm still not sure it exists. It's always documented in the band's British discography and presumed it's out there - but I've NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN ONE?? So the inclusion of its 2 rare B-sides here is welcome. The five new out-takes as you can imagine are a mixed bag, some good, some iffy - and obvious in most cases why they were relegated to the vaults.  But as a rabid fan of the album, I'm grooving to them more and more. The lyrics to one of them, \\"Wave Of Sorrow (Birdland)\\", is even in the hardback book.     The DVD is not in 5.1 Surround, but it still sounds and looks amazing. Filmed at The Hippodrome de Vincennes in Paris on the 4th of July 1987, it shows the band in full flight - and they were just electrifying - on fire. Some mellow tracks like \\"October\\" and \\"MLK\\" also get rare outings here too - superb. The band then hits the crowd with an absolutely lethal triple whammy of \\"In God's Country\\", \\"Electric Co.\\" and \\"Bad\\". The Edge's playing during \\"Electric Co.\\" is simply hair-raising - and I swear - at moments during the song - they were simply the best band on the planet! Also towards the end of the song, a \\"huge\\" bare-chested male French fan is lifted up onto the stage; he in turn lifts Bono up into his arms and Bono then adds \\"Break On Through\\" by The Doors onto the end of the blistering \\"Electric Co\\". The crowd went wild!      To sum up: the album is remastered to spectacular effect, the bonus CD of B-sides and outtakes is never less than fantastic and the DVD simply the visual icing on top of an extraordinary cake. When you think that June 2007 has passed without a 40th Anniversary appreciation of \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" by The Beatles and November 2007 without a 35th Anniversary Edition of Zeppelin's \\"Four Symbols\\" - at least those at Universal and Island have had the brains not to miss this masterpiece's 20th Anniversary.

B00005JPLW|5.0|When I first heard about this movie, I thought it would be a testosterone-fuelled flick that only the guys would like (yeah, I'm a woman) and would be so blood-soaked that I would spend most of the movie staring at the floor. It wasn't until someone told me that the violence & blood was stylized, and not in your face gruesome that I went to see it and WOW, double-WOW, I loved it!! The movie is based on true historical events and possesses those timeless aspects of love, betrayal, honor, courage, bravery in the face of insurmountable odds, and oh yeah - kick *ss fighting for the good cause, that make a story great. I found the stylized cinematography of the movie suited it perfectly, and in fact ramped up the drama. It has a rock 'n roll edge, but with lots of substance & heart. The actors were perfectly cast and delivered outstanding & powerful performances that move you. I also really liked Queen Gorgo, a very strong female character who her husband admires, adores, and listens to, and who does what she can to fight for her family and her people...and did I mention the oodles of eye candy for the girls?! See ladies, this movie's got barrels of enjoyment for you, too! ;)<br /><br />This movie reminded me that what we do in this life matters, that our character, our courage can and do make a difference, in ways we may never know and never be able to predict. This is the kind of gift that art/entertainment can bring that makes it so important - it inspires us to aim high, to make our lives meaningful and to never settle, never give up, never give in...<br /><br />Rai Aren
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I've waited a long time for this set.  I'm lucky enough that the first time I saw Blade Runner was in Leicester Square 1982 and saw the International Version.  I too prefer the narration, and was peeved to hear Harrison Ford say that he tried to muff the delivery so they wouldn't use it.  The '92 Directors cut was awful - Unicorn?  Anyway, glad to know the International cut is in this set.  I'm a huge BR fan but don't need to pay an extra thirty bucks for the work print disc and a shiny case.
B00005JPGO|5.0|This movie does what movies rarely do, make you think about real-life issues/events in the world and want to act accordingly. It is honestly unforgettable. You realize this isn't just make-believe, these kinds of things can and do happen and it shakes you, changes you.<br /><br />As a movie, wow, it is a riveting watch, though at times very difficult to watch, it will expose you to some pretty horrific things, but not to shock, just to show the reality. The acting is fantastic, Leo & Djimon are truly outstanding in their roles and do the film's difficult subject matter justice. This movie had us talking about the issues, and that is when art is at its best, when it makes you think, question, debate, and maybe squirm a little...<br /><br />Rai Aren
B0009PRNVK|5.0|This is gonna be a short and sweet review, so...<br /><br />Maiden England is Iron Maiden's England gig duirng \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Tour\\" in 1989. I downloaded Maiden England via Ares.<br /><br />ME is their best, IMO. It starts with Moonchild, and ends with Iron Maiden. I'm even surprised they performed \\"Killers\\"! The stage theme is an Iceberg. You gotta love the slideshow at the beginning, and Bruce's \\"Teddy Bear\\" thing on stage before \\"Infinite Dreams\\"!<br /><br />This is a must-have for any maiden fan. Up the irons!
B000TERJG0|5.0|I haven't listened to the entire cd yet because I'm so stuck on the song High Times.  I love this song.  Outstanding.  If this turned out to be the only great song on the cd it would be worth 5 stars.
006112429X|5.0|A chilling read for anyone who's ever wondered what leads a child to massacre their schoolmates. We like the safety of thinking that it was something in their upbringing, maybe abusive or neglectful parents. But what about a child who came from a happy family with loving parents and what, from all outward appearances, should have been an idyllic childhood? Told from the perspective of Kevin's mother in letters to her now-estranged husband, she relives and recounts the years from the time they met through present-day visits with Kevin in prison.    Near the end of the book, Shriver brings in a stunning twist that chilled me to the bone. Not for the weak of heart, this one stays with you.
B000000OYQ|5.0|Great and sadly last solo effort from guitar hero Jimmy Page.  Now that Zeppelin has reunited the world can be at ease.  But if you want to hear an amazing piece of zeppelin style guitar magic this is for you.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|Althought the packaging may remind people of barbies, Gilmore Girls hands down was an amazing series.  There is no difference in owning each season individually or owning the complete set together.  Most people realized this when Friends released their complete set in a nice collectors box.  (Fortuanately everyone who already owned most of the seasons could still receive this collectors box after purchasing season 10)<br /><br />Buying this set makes for a nice addition to any video collection, but the individual seasons are all nicely packaged as well so there is virtually no difference.<br /><br />Basically it comes down to how much room you want to take up on your video shelf.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I rented Hairspray from Netflix to watch it.I love her Hairspray and everything about the movie.John Travolta looked funny when he played a woman is Edna Turnblad is the mother of Tracey Turnblad who who wanted to get the Lead to win in Miss Teen Hairspray on The Corny Collins Show.This movie was feel with Entertainment & Musical.Zac Efron as Link Larkin was the Best especially that he sang A Ladies Choice.Zac Efron gave his Best Performance on Hairspray as Link Larkin and I was so glad to see him doing other project besides Disney.Is newcomer actress is Nikki Blonsky did a Graet Performance playing Tracey Turnblad she can sing that her voice is good.I hope I'll to see Nikki Blonsky doing more movies in the Future to come for her.I would like to own this movie on DVD.I recommand  to EVERYONE TO GET IT!!!!Hairspray is the Best Musical Movie that the Whole Family enjoy together!!!!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|As a practising physician, who has practised in 3 countries, I do believe that this is a must watch movie for everyone in the healthcare field. Unfortunately, the masses have been decieved for too long as to who is really benefiting from our for profit health care system. The republicans are not going to fix this mess, neither are the democrats. Both parties have sold their souls to the healthcare lobbyists. Only the American people can take back their healthcare.<br />  The other side of the coin is that are the American people prepared for a health care that may make all of us equal?
B00026YO36|5.0|How do you define this record?  It cannot be done.  This is the mark of a   great artist... when you cannot catagorize his music, or say \\"it sounds  like...\\"   Lanegan spins tales of sadness and despair without ever being  melodramatic.  His voice rarely gets over a whisper on a lot of the tracks.  Yes, there are some rocking tunes, but the introspective stuff  like \\"Strange Religion\\" and \\"Morning Glory Wine\\" are the real masterpieces here.  If you are looking for a Screaming Trees style rock  record (and I was) you will be out of luck.  But what I found was something much better and much deeper.  At first listen it doesnt sound  like much, but it creeps under your skin and infects you.  He really does  sound like a lounge act, and pulls great supporting performances out of a  number of high-profile guest musicians.   This is truly great stuff and I  cannot wait to get some of his other discs.  Who knew he had so many  records!!
1594489505|4.0|Another Tale of Two Cities, but this time it is Herat and Kabul, not London and Paris. A Thousand Splendid Suns is set during a revolution (or two) with a modern-day hero who makes the ultimate sacrifice so two others can marry.  However, this time it is not a man (Sidney Carton) who surrenders his life, but a woman, Mariam, from whom much has been taken, including her joie de vivre, and to whom little has been freely given (only her life), reminiscent of Miss Saigon.    It is a story of people trying to eke out a meaningful life amid competing and changing governments that interfere with life in ways from bombings to kidnappings to random violence.    This is not a gray book: it's a taupe* book, like the unforgiving color of Afghanistan. Sprinkled with a good number of unfamiliar but easily understood Dari words and names, A Thousand Splendid Suns (sons?), is not hard reading, though it starts out a bit slow. And the average reader might gloss over names like Massoud, Rabbani, Daoud, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Jalaluddin Haqqani. . .     There is nothing new in this book - recall that the May day in 1933 when the Nazis began their campaign of book burning was neither the first nor the last such occurrence. Before that, even the Christians burned books (see `book burning' in Wikipedia for information on 57 incidences of book burning down through the ages). And after that, the Taliban burned books in Kabul and everywhere they could (except for the Koran, of course).    A Thousand Splendid Suns is both a calming and suspenseful work of literature. Calming in that we here in Afghanistan know how it ends but suspenseful in that the four parts of the book take us from Herat to Kabul and through four major governments along with the experience of living, or rather surviving - much harder than you could possibly have imagined even after reading numerous books on Afghanistan's recent history. The novel begins during the monarchy and continues through the Russian war of occupation and the Mujahidin civil war, and ends near the end of the Taliban regime (who, surprisingly, brought not the worst of life and death to Kabul). Be ready to perhaps shed a few tears. Be ready to put it down if you are reading at night - the sparse violence (spousal abuse) can be frustrating and disturbing in more than one place.    This should be required reading for all women - to fully appreciate how women were and are treated in other societies (\\"A woman's face is her husband's business only.\\") AND it should be required reading for all men who hopefully will be flabbergasted at what men think about `their' women in other societies. Reading this book can help to break the cycle of violence around the world. You can check it out from the ARSIC-S J2 `library' in the basement of the old mosque.      *Taupe - light brown, fawn, mushroom, sand
B000HA4WT8|4.0|if you like hot import cars and drifting then you will like this movie as i do.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This is one of the best movies out there.  Completely deserving of the 3 Academy Awards it won (Best Actor, Best Director, & Best Screenplay).     If you like old war movies, with high drama, and a great story, this is a good movie for you.  It is a long movie, but worth the watch.
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|Ok, I admit it, Epica (or at least some Epica) takes a lot of patience to get used to.  I absolutely hated Epica upon my first encounter with \\"The Phantom Agony.\\"  I was turned off this album by the same thing (too many overpowering male grunts and growlings) but some really good riffs in which Simone sings caught my attention long enough for me to give the album several listens.  Needless to say, I'm now a very avid Epica fan.    Yes, I still do fault Epica for too much male grunting (especially in \\"The Obsessive Devotion\\" which could otherwise be an absolutely amazing song), thus the 4/5 instead of 5/5 which they are certainly capable of achieving but I think that a patient listener can definitely learn to ignore some of it and really find the gems in this album.  Epica is definitely heading towards being one of the divas of symphonic metal/rock (along with Nightwish, and Within Temptation) and it's certainly one of the heavier female-fronted ones.    Simone Simons, of course, is about 80% of what makes Epica good.  She's not just gorgeous but she has a very strong and beautiful voice.  I would compare it most closely to Tarja's, the ex-Nightwish singer, because Simone has a classical-type voice but she has far more subtlety than Tarja.    Run through of the songs:    1. Indigo - 3.5/5 Intro song.  Good intro - very slow, lots of chorus.  2. The Obsessive Devotion - 3.5/5 Simone's opening vocals and so incredibly hauntingly chilling that I was entranced by this song at once.  It is ruined by practically five straight minutes of male grunts after that.  3. Menace of Vanity - 3/5 One of the heaviest songs.  Lots of male grunts.  I'm not a huge fan of this one.  4. Chasing the Dragon - 2.5/5 An incredibly boring ballad.  Epica's not very good with ballads, in general.  5. Never Enough - 5/5 Epica takes their own style and mixes it with a slightly more mainstream sound (think new Nightwish) and the result is amazing.  Simone shines in this one.  6. La-Fetach Chataz Rovetz (The Final Embrace) - 4/5 A slower interlude song that, nonetheless, has a beautiful melody.  7. Death of a Dream (the Embrace that Smothers part VII) - 3.5/5 Again, there's a great female riff in the midst of grunts and death choruses.  Which they would have played upon it more.  8. Living a Lie (the Embrace that Smothers part VIII) - 4/5 Ok, it's both heavy and sort of slow but I like it.  Simone dominates it enough.  9. Fools of Damnation (the Embrace that Smothers part IX) - 5/5 Yes, it has grunts but I tend to ignore them because this song is just so good.  Has an Indian sound to the beginning.  10. Beyond Belief - 5/5 Full of choir bits and it's heavy enough without resorting to growling and grunting.  Slow verse that moves into a fast-paced chorus.  11. Safeguard to Paradise - 4/5 It's actually a fairly decent ballad.  No, it doesn't compare to \\"Solitary Ground\\" from Consign to Oblivion but it's fun to listen to.  12. Sancta Terra - 6/5 Without doubt, my favorite song on the album.  It's catchy, haunting, unique, and Simone absolutely shines.  13. The Divine Conspiracy - 4.5/5 There's no doubt that it's too long at nearly 14 minutes but it's a great song full of two catchy heavy choir riffs.  You just have to get about two minutes into it to get it's wealth and towards the end it just starts to get boringly long.    Epica certainly has room to improve but for now, they certainly shine with their own style.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This is a good movie.  I love it.  It was cheap and was delivered quick.    This was a good seller, I would buy from them in the future.
B000085RTX|5.0|Kamelot can not seem to go wrong.  Four whole albums later than Karma, they're still rolling out Epic, catchy, and best of the best albums.  I came back to Karma in a Kamelot-frenzy (obsession with the newer albums The Black Halo and Ghost Opera), trying to find whatever Kamelot I could.    Kamelot is always good but Karma is a particular gem.  It's really the start of it all where Kamelot really got off the ground and to the level where they are now.  Even know, after many other albums, Kamelot is still playing \\"Forever\\" and \\"Karma\\" live (SEE THEM LIVE!  THEY'RE AMAZING!  Ok, I'm done with my plug).  Because these songs never get old.    For those who aren't familiar with Kamelot, it's a Epic symphonic metal band, in my opinion, the male-led counterpart to the old Nightwish.  It's very listenable - I think that the songs would catch anyone the first time listening to it.  The lead singer Khan has a very powerful voice and, unlike some other symphonic metal bands, actually sings rather than growl, scream, or grunt.    Song run-through:    1. Regalis Apertura - 4/5 One of the best intros I've heard yet.  Orchestrated with a melody that reoccurs in \\"Karma.\\"  2. Forever - 5/5 Catchy, fast-paced, melodic.  Great stuff.  This tends to be the \\"sing-back\\" song at concerts.  3. Wings of Despair - 4.5/5 Love this song.  It's catchy and great.  4. The Spell - 3.5/5 Not one of my particular favorites.  It doesn't really stand out much and the chorus slows down some.  5. Don't You Cry - 5/5 A beautifully sad ballad written in honor of Thomas Youngblood's dead father.  Khan really milks this song in the gentlest purr.  6. Karma - 6/5 The superstar song of the album and one of my favorite Kamelot songs to date.  The intro is a fast-paced version of \\"Regalis Apertura\\" and it's epic, loud, huge, and just plain amazing.  7. The Light I Shine on You - 4/5 I can't really remember this song that well.  It's pretty good, nothing super special.  8. Temples of God - 4.5/5 A very simple, pretty song with a very nice intro.  9. Across the Highlands - 4.5/5 Another very catchy, fairly simple song with a nice melody.  10, 11, 12. Elizabeth: I, II, III - 4/5  This is supposed to be one song (or at least one story) broken up into three parts.  The first is fairly slow and soft, the second gains momentum, and the third finishs off as with a bang.  It took me awhile to really like any part of this song.  I'm still not a huge fan of the first song but I do like the second and third parts.  All three parts are fairly haunting in melody and Khan really puts forth a good show.    Anyway, this is great stuff.  If you're into newer Kamelot, don't be put off by the old date.  This is just as good.
0375505091|2.0|I don't really know any of the author's work.  This was my first exposure to her and I had a hard time seeing what is so great about it.  3/4 of the book is full of b/w pictures of people lounging around at their worst.  Anyone could have taken many of the pictures.    There are some decent portraits but nothing that you can't find in three dozen other books from a lot of authors.      I have heard her referred to as the greatest American photographer of the 20th century, maybe there are things she did a long time ago somewhere that prove it but this book just can't be a showcase of why she is so great...
0316067598|5.0|With leadership in all facets of life at an all time low, this book should and will inspire future leaders how to react to any and all stress filled situations.

B000YAF4OS|5.0|After a bad storm that puts a tree through his studio window, David Drayton (Jane), his son Billy (Gamble), and neighbor Brent (Braugher) head into town to get some supplies from the supermarket.  Once there, the mist that they saw rolling across the lake has made it into town and engulfs the store.  The terror level is upped when a man runs into the store with blood on his face, screaming that there is something out there.  Indeed, there is, and soon those trapped in the store see what it is.  To make matters worse, a religious fanatic by the name of Mrs. Carmody (Harden) is stirring up some of the customers with her talk of the end of the world.  David finds himself looked to for guidance, and when things seem to be as bad as they can be, things get worse.<br /><br />Director Frank Darabont takes another stab at a Stephen King story, this time a horror story, and succeeds quite well.  Like \\"The Shawshank Redemprion\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\", \\"The Mist\\" is a faithful adaptation of the source material, with an added on ending that may or may not work for viewers.  I, for one, enjoy endings of this nature, but am not sure that it was the right ending to tack on the end of this particular story.  The acting is solid all around, especially Marcia Gay Harden as the disturbing Mrs. Carmody.  The film has its share of monsters, but the scariest ones are inside the store, not outside it.  \\"The Mist\\" works because it is a smart thriller, directed by an excellent director.  I recommend this film.
B0000X61VE|2.0|I used this exercise routine for a few years before I realized it was aggravating a hip problem to the point that I had to have a hip replacement at age 40. I didn't realize the pain I was having was caused by these exercises, until I stopped doing them.  She moves too fast and has terrible form.  Most of the exercises are great, I love the ab workout, but beware of the hip and leg movements.  I learned too late the damage it can cause.

0440238609|1.0|I just finished these books. I very much wish I had not started. The first two books are not particularly well written, Extensively developing characters and situations that are not relevant to the story and ultimately a vacuous waste of time. In book 3 it becomes clear the purpose of the first 2 is to attempt to lend legitimacy (through sheer weight) by turning the third book into a trilogy.<br /><br />I am FAR from fanatical about this stuff, and thought those who condemned Harry Potter were overreacting at a basically irrational level.<br /><br />But these books are quite another matter indeed. They are truly the most virulent, blasphemous, and obscene things I have had the misfortune to stumble upon.  I do NOT appreciate Amazon's recommendation that because I liked Harry Potter I would like these.  Other than the main protagonist being under 18 they have little, if anything at all, in common.<br /><br />I was stunned by the depth of anger and hatred dished out by Mr. Pullman. Dare I say it is reminiscent of the Nazis?  Some might well see similarities.<br /><br />Having wasted my time, and polluted my brain with this trash the only good that can come of it is to warn off everyone I can.<br /><br />So be warned, \\"The Golden Compass\\" is Pullman's platform for a many hours long rant of his malevolent hatred of God, and just about anything else to do with objective morals. Any person believing in any higher being, or even the absolutes of right and wrong, should consider this a MUST MISS!!
0345347951|4.0|It's hard to believe this book was written 50 years ago.  You never see the ending coming, and it almost reminds one of Stephen King.  It's a bit choppy as it segways into the end, but nicely drawn out and worth it.  All the explanations are there, as they should be.  Very cool.  Too many books leave you hanging, but this was a very satifying read.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Ordinarly not a film I would, under most instances, choose to sit down and watch, however \\"The Illusionist\\", like an earlier reviewer 'Bu-chan' said, was one that I \\"surprisingly enjoyed a hell of a lot.\\"  Something I would not have ordinarly have rented or bought in a whim, but was surprised by its rich and elegant manner of purity. I was away probably in the jungle or backpacking Prague when this came out.<br /><br />This gentle, immaculate and restrained fable about true love, strength and subterfuge in Vienna is tremendously imagined and yet strangely stagnant. I love movies that sort of come out of nowhere and knock you out a bit because you really didn't expect it to be so well done. A real gem it was. A masterpiece of acting. Simply top notch characters with believable dialog and Jessica Biel is simply stunning, magically gorgeous and her acting in the period with everyone else in a rich, enticing mesmorizing plot and storyline, is true to all the characters never breaking rank from the period and THAT is a nod for our friend Neil Berger...<br /><br />...Paul Giamatti (Cinderella Men, American Splendor!!, Lady in The Water) is tremendous. When you can shine in a film where totality of brilliant acting can be achieved through an engrossing script and a tremendous ensemble, we can see the craft come through without effort.

1860498833|5.0|A wonderful novel chock full of historical detail. Sarah Waters has done her homework and given us a rare and fascinating glimpse inside the sexual practices of one segment of the working class in Victorian England.  Sue and Maud are imperfect heroines who have a lesbian relationship. It's not exactly a romance imo, but more a case of two young women desiring closeness and finding a haven within each other's arms in order to survive the harsh world they inhabit. At times, they work against one another and both are the pawns of men on occasion.  Their world is a bit sordid and seamy, but it almost seemed like Sarah Waters had been there--that's how real it all was.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading about different lifestyles and sexual preferences within a historical context, give this a try.  Very unusual and well written. Still, it may be Victorian, but it's not for the straight-laced.
B000002VCT|5.0|\\"Pyramid\\" was the APP third album, and a good on it is.  This disc leaned a bit more in the pop direction than previous efforts, but the songs are all strong.  The theme of the album revolves around the 70's concept of pyramid power and similar fads.  As always the production is stellar with Parsons at the helm.  The music and lyrics are all good with several instrumental tracks mixed in with the vocal stuff.  I pretty much like every song on the disc.  This one is essential for Parsons fans.
0425188809|5.0|This is my favorite Koontz book (and I have read almost everything he has written). I read this several years ago and just recently bought it for my daughter and granddaughter.  I'm a pet lover so Einstein was a fabulous main character.  It's an exciting book with just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.  Loved the ending!
B000002VC5|5.0|Alan Parsons was best known as the producer / engineer on Pink Floyd's magnum opus \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\".  He had also worked on albums by The Beatles and Al Stewart.  Along with his songwriting partner Eric Wolfson Parson's formed the Alan Parsons project in 1977 releasing their first album \\"Tales Of Mystery And Imagination\\" an adaptation of the works of Edgar Allan Poe.  The \\"Project\\" had mostly stable cast of musicians with a revolving roster of vocalists.  \\"I Robot\\" was a concept album about \\"the rise of the machine and the decline of man\\" (from the liner notes).  This is great stuff and probably one of the band's best albums.  It was also the disc that brought them to a level of commercial success with the single \\"I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You\\".  The album flows together with instrumental and vocal tracks filled with electronics and keyboards that were state of the art at the time.  The album really is similar to Pink Floyd in spots especially on the excellent \\"Show Must Go On\\".  As I have seen others mention this would make a great soundtrack for a science fiction film.  Sonically the album still sounds fantastic.  The version I have has not been remastered yet it sounds incredible on a good stereo system.  The album may sound a bit dated today, but it remains one of my favorite discs of the 70's.
0385522401|4.0|I had never read Ian McEwan before and was glad I was lent this book.  I think that the author captured and described Florence's and Edward's feelings on their wedding night with very deep eloquence and empathy.  I also found it interesting that the whole book describes one night alone, encapsulating hidden emotions, fears and sentiments vividly, and, simultaneously, taking the reader back in time very realistically.    A charming book indeed, reminiscent of \\"the good old days\\" but under certain aspects, quite contemporary too.  Whether one seems, in more than one way, a bit \\"out of the ordinary\\", like Florence, or not, I think that the main message this book conveys is that human nature does not change much during the passage of time and that if something is \\"not meant to be\\", then it should not be.  It teaches to trust your instincts before acting upon something that you know you do not like or appreciate, even if it is expected by unwritten rules, or indeed, by yourself, who desperately want to \\"conform\\".  Generally speaking, it is more honest to clear the air immediately, even at the price of causing hurt, than to carry on unwillingly, with unintended but unavoidable deception.  In the long run, this would cause far more pain for those involved.    Of course, getting back to Florence, and to Edward too up to a certain degree, and considering the time frame (1962), all of the above was much easier said than done.  And that's exactly what I have appreciated most about this book: the capture of those suppressed feelings, pictured and frozen in time.  Lovely book.
B000VLE3IS|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband, and its great - but - I was disappointed to see Thank You and Boogie With Stu left out, though.  Before it hit the stores, the way they were touting it, I thought it would be really thorough and definitely include these two, and maybe Hot Dog or some of their really fun stuff that you don't hear on the radio. But aside from that, I have a hard time feeling negatively about any Led Zeppelin product after 30+ years of being a loyal fan.
0143038419|5.0|In today's culture and society, certain things are expected of you especially from you family and loved ones. If we don't learn to listen to our own heart and go within but instead learn to ignore it and just do what is expected of us, well then one day you end up depressed and/or in a painful situation.     I've been there and went the route of self help books and yoga just like Elizabeth. But thankfully I didn't have all the struggles (i.e. major depression) she did nor (unfortunatley) did I have the amazing experience of traveling for 9 months  from Italy, India and to Indonesia. What an interesting story her travels made. She is a fantastic writer who speaks from her heart without shame. Her insights helped me see things I missed when going thru similar situations (like infatuated love or abstinence). She also taught me so much about Yoga, meditation, Italy, India and Indonesia which was so exciting and I also love to travel.     I listened to this in audiobook format unabridged, spoken by the author which made it all the more riveting. I finished it (13 hours) in about 3 days! Looking forward to reading (listening to) it again and plan to buy it for my girlfriends.

0143036556|5.0|Diamond has followed the triumph of [[ASIN:0393061310 Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]](W.W. Norton & Co., 1997) with another brilliant take on history, this one with more profound implications concerning our imminent future. Read in conjunction with Kevin Phillips' [[ASIN:B00119O0M8 American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury]], and in light of recent climatological data, one can't escape the feeling that we are in very deep trouble. In a recent interview environmental educator David Orr told me, \\"\\"Humanity has faced crises before, but there has never been such a high likelihood that we would destroy ourselves. Even nuclear war would probably have left survivors, but climate change, collapsing biodiversity and toxic pollutants are all hitting at once. Any one of them could do it.\\" This week I read an interview with James Lovelock, progenitor of the Gaia theory which is now widely accepted as a very accurate vision of how our planet works, and he postulated that the International Panel on Climate Change is being too conservative in its estimates concerning global warming. Lovelock notes that the last time the poles melted at the current rate, the oceans rose 80 feet, and he predicts that as many as 6 billion people may die as a result of the current spasm by the end of this century. Diamond's view is more conservative than that, but he too finds little comfort in our culture's trajectory. Using examples from around the globe and throughout history, Diamond offers what hope can be gained in learning from past mistakes. But is there time? This is essential reading for anyone who wants to get some kind of handle on our fate.

B00005JNDZ|4.0|Well I do love british comedy and I think you have to in order to appreciate this movie.  I actually liked this much better than the original.  It is very quiky and Collin Firth is excellent in it.  There is not a lot of meat to the story - but that is not what the movie is about.  Its all about the situations that Bridget gets into and if you go into this movie expecting some kind of award winning plot you will be dissappointed.  Take it for what it is - a great situational comedy! Pair this one up with \\"Love, Actually\\" and you are in for a great night of hillarious fun!
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Bruce is back and this album is genuine New Jersey Springsteen just like his albums \\"The River\\", \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\", and \\"Greetings from Asbury Park\\".  Several of the songs on this album give me chills, including Long Walk Home, (absolutely awesome)Devil's Arcade, and Last to Die.  Although I don't care for Bruce or any other performer using their talent to send a political message, Bruce is able to do this while providing quality poetry.    I own every Springsteen album (even the Ghost of Tom Joad which was a major departure from the Stone Pony Bruce that put the E Street Band on the map, and definitely Bruce's least moving work).  My only criticism of this album is that there are a few songs that sound similar to a few songs on Bruce's 2002 Album of the Year, \\"The Rising\\".  \\"Livin in the Future\\" parallels with \\"Waiting on a Sunny Day\\" and although I love \\"Long Walk Home\\" it's message about a soldier being stuck in an endless war is too synonymous with a man who feels guilty about surviving 9.11.01 in The Rising's \\"Nothing Man\\".      Put all of this aside though if you are looking to hear vintage Bruce and the E-Steet Band.  The best line in a Springsteen Song since \\"Down here it's just winners and losers and don't get caught on the wrong side of that line\\" (Altantic City) comes from Long Walk Home:    \\"Your flag flyin' over the courthouse  Means certain things are set in stone.  Who we are, what we'll do and what we won't\\"      Very salient and piognant when you consider Bruce's criticism of the war in Iraq and what our constitution says about who America is and what we stand for.  Regardless of your political affilation and your opinions about current events, Bruce has delivered another solid album.  It's as genuine and emotional as \\"The Rising\\" was moving, just don't be surprised when you hear some of the same chords and harmonies...
0375847227|5.0|I think it's interesting how people come here and say this series of books isn't for children because of its anti-Christian message.  Following such logic to its fullest would mean that The Chronicles of Narnia or Pilgrim's Progress are equally not for children due to their obvious pro-Christian message.  Aren't they just as guilty in their attempts to indoctrinate children with Christian beliefs?  What these people really mean is that you shouldn't let your children read this series if you don't want them exposed to alternative ideologies that might compromise your agenda of indoctrination.  However, if you are a parent who is interested in instilling critical thinking skills into your children, then by all means buy this series, read it together, discuss it, then let them decide for themselves what they are going to believe.

Anyone interested in military history and how war affects those closest to it will find Sledge's book enthralling.
0143038583|5.0|I would have never thought that a book which devoted nearly 1/3 of its pages to the history and use of corn could be so compelling and interesting, but Omnivore's Dilemma managed to be just that. In this book, Michael Pollan traces the origins, cost (direct and indirect), and enjoyment of four different types of meals: Industrial, Big Organic, Local Organic, and Hunter/Gatherer.<br /><br />The industrial, which most of us eat every day is the most disturbing and tragic. This meal is comprised of the corn-based nutrients which make up a large part of the American diet, are grown on a large section of American farmland, consume a large part of the national budget, and make a significant contribution to the American obesity crisis. In this section the author and his family consume a fast-food meal at McDonalds, which previous to eating, he attempts to track down the ingredients of the meal right back to one of the big industrial farms where most of its constituent parts had been grown. The stats in this section are staggering and are apt to make any American eater cringe. (They are also one of the reasons I was \\"glued\\" to this book so I won't completely spill the beans.) Depending on what it is you're eating, industrial food sources consume over 10 calories of fossil fuels for every calorie of energy these foods produce in the consumer. The land which produces industrial corn (and other grains) is ravaged by the extraordinary amounts of pesticides and fertilizer which one-crop farms distribute in their fields, producing not only much of the food we eat (check your labels for high fructose corn syrup) but also its packaging. And, though the American government spends billions yearly to subsidize the farming of corn (but not carrots or other more healthy crops), all but the largest corporate farms are going broke producing this commodity of a million uses. But, to hear most politicians talk, these farm subsidies are in place because of the \\"little guy\\", the family farm, when in reality, these subsidies go to millionaire farmers and huge corporations.<br /><br />Corn is grown to feed us (and not just on the cob mind you), but it is also grown to feed our livestock. That's right, animals which are not made to eat corn are fed it by the bushel-full to grow them as large as possible as fast as possible and to assist in consuming a commodity which we have far too much of. This creates a whole host of unintended consequences which made me want to yell at the politicians which represent us. This section is filled with examples of how misguided our farm policy and our diet is in this country. For example, cows, which are made to eat grass not grains, are fed insane amounts of corn so that they can get fat and become ground beef. But, this radically changes the acidity of their stomachs. Now, the E Coli bacteria, which use to survive in cows' stomachs but die in ours because the acidity rate is so much higher, now have mutated to survive in cattle's now-acidic stomachs and thus thrive in ours, making us dreadfully sick. Meanwhile, eating this much corn makes the animals sick so they are injected with tremendous amounts of antibiotics to keep them well during their brief and unhappy lives.<br /><br />Now, you might expect that the point of this expose' on American farming and eating is to suggest \\"organic\\". But, he is just as critical towards \\"Big Organic\\" concerns such as Whole Foods, or the farms that supply Wal-Mart and other big-box stores with their organic products. Though, he argues, having any farmland set aside to be farmed with organic methodology is very beneficial, the organic benchmarks set by the USDA are so low, that in principle, there is little separation between big industrial farming and big organic farming, save for the lack of pesticides and antibiotics. But, the elimination of these last two things are phenomenal to the health of the farmland, rivers, animals, and eaters across the American landscape.<br /><br />After eating a meal at McDonald's and Whole Foods, Pollan then turns his attention to a local organic farm in Virginia (which won't ship it's food anywhere - it must be picked up) and a meal that he collects through hunting and gathering. Though the local farm, if you have one nearby, is slightly more practical and thus sustainable, neither of these options are available to a large part of the US population so the reader is left wondering what their options are for eating with a conscience.<br /><br />For me, I now make a point of looking for organic foods. Though I realize that because the US government is involved, some of the organic foods that I purchase may still have a high environmental cost, it is still considerably less than the industrial model. Animals are treated more \\"humanely\\", farming is less destructive to the land and environment, the raw materials are less subsidized by the federal government, and the finished product normally tastes better - a lot better. Presently, shopping organic does \\"cost\\" more but there are hidden costs built into the low price of industrial food. Not only do traditional foodstuffs leave a huge imprint on the landscape and environment, they are tremendously subsidized by the American taxpayer. So, it could be argued that organic products are NOT actually more expensive (especially if you have a Trader Joe's nearby).<br /><br />I hope that you will pick up this book and consider your eating as a worldview issue. Though I am sure that someday soon I will find myself coaxed by my kids into stopping by McDonald's for some of their McNuggets glistened with lighter fluid (another incidental fact uncovered in Omnivore's Dilemma) I now believe that convenience and speed is not often an indication that the food item is actually good for me, or for the world that I inhabit. We Americans spend and inordinate amount of money and a great deal of time either planning for or actually consuming a meal, it seems prudent to critically inspect the manner in which we eat and ask ourselves, \\"Am I eating what I believe?\\"Whole Foods, Pollan then turns his attention to a local organic farm in Virginia (which won't ship it's food anywhere - it must be picked up) and a meal that he collects through hunting and gathering.

0740748475|4.0|My son received this the first year it came out. He's 11 now. This STILL sits on his bedside table and he STILL reads the comics often.  We had some of the other compilation books (still do) that we got before this came out, but this set is just such a beautiful presentation and the books look to be so high quality.<br /><br />Actually, that's why I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5-- the books LOOK high quality, but they are only mediocre quality. The pages are thinner than average and the binding doesn't appear to be so strong.  Still, though, the thinner pages probably kept the size of the collection a decent size and takes up less room on the shelf.<br /><br />And, with the protective case and hardcover, they should last as long as one is careful.  We've had this a couple of years now (I think) and it's in superb condition even though my son reads these frequently.<br /><br />As for the material itself, I don't think one can ever really tire of Calvin and Hobbes.  It's hysterical stuff and pretty politically incorrect (which I always find refreshing).  It's laugh-out-loud funny and great for all ages.

Ury<br /><br />\\"Getting to Yes\\" is the benchmark by which all other books on negotiating should be judged.  Authors Fisher, Patton and Ury have penned a book that has become a classic in its class as their negotiating principles have been used and quoted again and again the world over.<br /><br />\\"Getting to Yes\\" is quite deceptive at first - it seems a little light weight as it is so easy to read.  In fact one could read it from cover to cover in half a day quite easily.  Yet, the four principles outlined in their negotiating method whilst simple in nature are comprehensive and effective.  This is one of the first books on negotiating to break away from the \\"hard v's soft\\" negotiating paradigm by introducing \\"principled\\" negotiating - ie. negotiating on the basis of both party's needs, not positions.  Fisher et al, also cover very well the \\"What if\\" situations where the other party maybe more powerful, uses dirty tricks or won't play the game.<br /><br />This book should be essential reading for everyone who has to negotiate with someone else over reaching a decision - and isn't that all of us?<br /><br />Bob Selden, author of [[ASIN:1432714287 What To Do When You Become The Boss: How new managers become successful managers]]

B000VZC4CQ|5.0|My friend got me into New Order because of their song, \\"Age of Consent.\\" I found the song to be very uplifting, upbeat, and catchy. I did a little research and found out that Joy Division was the initial band before the remaining members (after the lead singer's death) decided to create New Order. So, I found this album at the record store and bought it on a whim not knowing what exactly to expect.<br />I instantly fell in love with this album! The style is nothing like New Order. The music does have a few danceable licks in it but the singing is constantly very low and melancholy. This contrast is outstanding and the emotion and passion in the music is so beautiful!<br /><br />This album is perfect, even by today's standards.

Let's just say that of the 40 minutes they added to the Fuzzball Rally, a good 80% of it is too taboo for telly.  Yeah.  It's good.  In addition to the extra footage of the US tour, it has everything that the UK DVD had (which is a hell of a lot more than what the standard US DVD had), and an entirely new commentary featuring none other than Quentin Tarantino.

This band's history is so pathetic that Spinal Tap seems real after what has happened to the biggest dissapointments EVER in the history of heavy music.

The sound and color were fantastic. Couldn't have asked for better!! The additional CD had extra \\"goodies\\" on it. We gave the CD collection away as a door prize so I know whoever won it has a treasure!
B000OVLBF8|1.0|What on earth!?<br /><br />This movie was terrible.  If cliches could kill, this movie would bring about the end of humankind.  It was entertaining in the fact that it was funny when it didn't mean to be.<br /><br />Poorly written script.<br />Terrible acting.<br />Pretty good special effects.<br />Creative (in a freaky, bizarre, shouldn't-have-done-that sort of way).<br /><br />They should pay Nicolas Cage millions to NOT act.
B000VR824S|5.0|With much anticipation after ordering this dvd and after reading all the comments before hand etc.. you really never know what to expect because of all the other music lover's expectations and their own gauge of critquing can be so different from what you consider your own personal level of what is poor to excellent.  Well having said that, I was not disappointed in the least.  Great guitar players all around, great music and really fun.    I do have to admit I did pretty much skip the Sheryl Crow segment.  I tried to be patient.  She is cute and a good person and all, but musically I agree with a few others, she should not have been there.  But as one other commenter stated, she and E.C. were an item at some point in time pre Malia thus the reason she was most likely performing?  Who knows who cares but she shouldn't have been there.    When Derek Trucks Band with his wife and the other guy singing the old Derek and the Dominoes song \\"Anyday\\", I thought it was absolutely killer.  I was thinking oh boy, what else is coming.    Yeah, Beck's quartet with young Tal was fantastic.  They were having a lot of fun amongst themselves and with the crowd giving such great support.    E.C. was really on top of it all as always.  I did catch his last 2007 tour with his latest band which was his backup.  They are all so very talented.  Even though I totally respect Derek Trucks and his talent, I was thinking what if Duane was alive and playing the concert with Eric.  Duane really had that touch down and played with some much feel.    The guy who I thought was so strong and solid (they all were really except for Sheryl Crow, sorry Sheryl) was Steve Winwood.  After watching how Clapton and Winwood did their Blind Faith tunes and more, you can imagine how good their Feb 2008 concert in N.Y. is going to be.    I thought Bill Murray added a lot of levity as the master of ceremonies and I can almost here Eric in his Brit accent asking and saying to Bill, we need to make it a jolly good time.    B.B. is a class act.  Buddy was as good as he always has been.  I have seen him so many times and he never disappoints.  He really cracks me up.      Bottom line, buy it and enjoy.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I bought this cd because I had seen Sara's video of \\"Lovesong\\" on VH1 and couldn't get enough of it. The cd has only 12 songs total which isn't a lot but the quality of the songs makes up for that. After listening to the album 2 or 3 times I realized that I liked every song and that's quite an achievement for any album.<br />The bottomline: If you liked \\"Lovesong\\" go and buy the album it's worth it!
B000MZHW4A|4.0|This is a terrific action drama with an excellent, almost documentary story.  I love dramas with some historical significance, especially when the script and acting are especially good.  DiCaprio and Hounsou are both marvelous actors, and they both shine in this movie.  Very glad I bought it and will watch it many times.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I loved this edition which contains both the black and white version and the new colorized one too.  I'm usually not a fan of colorization, but they did a superb job of making the colors look true to that era. I really loved this  set and would recommend it to anyone wanting to buy a great edition of this movie.

0805079831|4.0|Fair competition is an essential requirement for the success of the \\"free-market capitalism\\". Competition increases consumer choice and power, improves quality and reduces cost, as seen for the most part in the consumer electronics industry. However, absence of competition, proliferation of \\"no-bid\\" contracts, corporate welfare and protectionism give rise to a state of \\"corporatism\\" which is the target of this book [pp 15].    This book claims that deregulated capitalism does not produce a free market but a corporatist one, and does not go hand-in-hand with democracy. Then through several illustration from Chile to Poland, the author attempts to show that the rise of corporatism was midwifed by most brutal forms of coercion and subversion of the democratic process. [pp 18, 19]. Even in cases like Poland where the liberalization took place without considerable bloodshed, the leverages of IMF loans were used to  override democratic mandate. In short, Klein's thesis is that though Friedman's Chicago School Economics espouses individual freedom, free societies are an impediment for the adoption of these policies.    Consider two thought provoking questions raised by the author:  1. The ideology of communism is not blameless for the imposition of whole-sale repression and state-sponsored reign of terror. But what of the crusade to liberate world markets [pp 20] by systematically eliminating the opponents of the corporatist economic model?  2. The shock-doctors Friedman, Sachs et. al. are repeatedly quoted as likening their status as doctors administering unpalatable medicine. But what are the ethics regarding a patient who consciously refuses the treatment?    Two major drawbacks of this book are:  1. Klein attacks Friedman's statement that only a crisis produces real change, and that the economist's job is to keep alternatives available for those situations. The attack is somewhat misleading and unimpressive.  2. Missing from the book is the introduction of neo-liberalism in India. Although all the ill effects are present, at no time was the democratic system shocked into paralysis.    Of particular interest are the symptoms of corporatism emerging in the United States, the privatization of the military and that of disaster relief. Both of these are problematic not only as contrary to national interest, but also incompatible with the idea of fair competition.    Consider the military. A decision to go to war is of vital national importance, and should be avoided if similar goals can be achieved through diplomacy. However, overriding commercial interest in a privatized war could short-circuit the diplomatic process and hasten war against national interest. Secondly, a privatized military shields the public from the carnage of war and essentially circumvents the democratic process. Lastly, the private armies are not bound by ant law of war, and  are immune to prosecution. Even if this is remedied by clever contractual agreements, the effects remain highly undesirable.    For a disaster relief, the urgency of the situation makes it impossible to strike a good bargain and thus has to be through pre-negotiated insurance like policies. However, the consequences of failure is immense for the victims and disproportionately low for the corporations.    All in all, this was a very interesting book, although I did not agree with some parts this book raised several interesting questions which enhanced my understanding of the subject.
032147404X|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and I must say I didn't find the author's humor to be a problem.  Maybe I just don't mind corny.<br /><br />In any event, the book does have lots of photography hints, some obvious and some not so obvious.  One simple example that I really think is useful (and have used myself for years) is to take photos of signs so one can remember what castle, church, monument, museum, or town a photo was taken in.  By the end of vacation and 700 or more photos, I have been saved many times by that simple trick.<br /><br />There is probably something in here for beginners to intermediate shooters and for those who (like myself) were once pretty good SLR users, abandoned the film genre for point and shoot digital cameras and have now returned to use digital SLRs after some years away.  It is both a refresher and also stimulated me to reread my camera manual to find out how to use some of the tips on my Olympus digital SLR camera -- he focuses (pun unintended) on Nikon/Canon cameras but as the author points out, the discussions are relevant to all digital SLR cameras.<br /><br />It is an inexpensive book and I think it will prove to be well worth the small investment if I catch just a few special shots I would otherwise have missed.  I already see how that is very likely.

Unfortunately this book is a story of a woman and it's all about me, me and more me!

Give me more India and travel extravaganzas and less personal woes and me me me!!!
B000E33VWW|5.0|Knowing his downward trajectory during the last 15 years of his life makes \\"Capote,\\" the outstanding film about Truman Capote's years researching and writing \\"In Cold Blood,\\" even more riveting. The film constructs, with not one extraneous scene or unnecessary bit of dialog, an understanding of his place in literary society, and his chameleon-like ease at blending into the lives of the people whom he wanted to capture and luring them into trusting him with their lives and stories. His ability to say exactly what a publisher, a murderer, his lover, his oldest friend wanted to hear in order to court their love or trust, and seem to mean each word he said, is juxtaposed perfectly with his ability to cut them off at the knees, dismiss them, insult them, or ignore them when their needs don't suit his.     The Oscar-winning performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman is astonishing, not only because his impersonation of Capote's strained, high, tiny voice and his fussy mannerisms is so remarkably good, but because he moves effortlessly between charm and seemingly endless empathy to self-absorption of enormous proportion so smoothly and naturally. We both admire and revile him. In their roles, excellent actors Chris Cooper and Catherine Keener show indulgence and affection for him, as well as wariness and disgust with his deceit of others, of them, of himself. The script is often spare and the pacing, while perfect, is never rushed; what is not said by the characters is as important and full of meaning as the well-crafted dialog. We learn just enough about any character, any situation, to be able to piece together what its meaning will be to those involved. His actions and the reactions of others are carefully calibrated so that we are never in the dark as to what is going on or how his actions will reverberate, but we are trusted to be able to let the story build in our minds; the writer, director, and actors don't spoonfeed us but deftly piece the feelings, words, and actionsof the characters together so that the story builds and intermeshes exactly as it should. This is how a subtle story should be told.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|\\"Sky High\\" is one of the most pleasant surprises of recent years, a comedy/adventure that's funny, solid with the action scenes, and thoroughly charming.  A superhero movie that fits far more snugly into the comedy genre than most but that, thank Heaven, doesn't sink into a stupid parody, it's a nice change of pace from the more serious superhero films like the X-Men trilogy or \\"Batman Begins\\" (which, of course. are also highly recommemded).       Sky High is the hidden high school where the superheroes of tomorrow are trained; the main point-of-view character is Will (Michael Angarano), the son of the world's two greatest superheroes, The Commander and Jetstream (Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston).  Coming from such a pedigree, great things are expected from Will - unfortunately, unlike most of the other offspring of established super-people, he has yet to manifest any powers of his own, a secret he's not anxious to divulge.  Starting at the prestigious academy the same day as Will is his lifelong friend Layla (classic girl-next-door character here) Williams (Danielle Panabaker), who has a special way with plants.  The two are part of a clique that forms in the early going, and the student body quietly dreads the upcoming tryouts that determine who gets assigned to which camp - 'superhero' (the sought-after positions) or 'sidekick' (sort of the consolation prize).  Presiding over the tryouts is perennially cranky Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell in a rare non-horror role), who's loud, macho, and secretly very bitter that he never won acknowledgement as one of the world's great superheroes (was Guy Gardner an influence in creating this character?)  Most of the main characters get assigned to sidekick duty, but the clique becomes strained when Will's prodigious superpowers finally manifest themselves and he's welcomed among the A-listers.  Add to this a growing plot thread of some kind of secret threat menacing the school, and you're all set up for a great ride of a movie.  I agree with the reviewer who said that real-life high school should be this much fun.       The movie has fun with a lot of classic superhero themes without mocking them, and isn't too goofy that the action sequences become pointless.  Winning performaces all around, Sky High also stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kelly Vitz, Steven Strait, Dee-Jay Daniels, Nicolas Braun and Lynda Carter.      Great fun; recommended for one and all.
0740748475|4.0|Just bought/received this even though we already have several softcover volumes.  My son was thrilled to see this in the Reference Section of our library, and will freak out when he receives this at home to keep!  I must say that the weight of these books makes it difficult for a young person.  There's no way he'll be able to balance this on his stomach or read lying down.  This is a must-read on a tabletop.  Otherwise, great investment!  Great price - similar to COSTCO's price (just found it there today)!
0143039881|5.0|A previous reviewer claims that Arendt's book shows the ambivalence of human nature, proving that in effect anybody could have done what Eichmann did.  In fact, this is exactly the cynical point of view that Arendt opposes in this, and her other writings. Her argument here is a revision of her earlier position on 'radical evil' advanced in The Origins of Totalitarianism, a position which Heidegger claimed to find 'incomprehensible.'  She argues here that banality and \\"sheer thoughtlessness\\" (akin to Heidegger's reflections on boredom) are in fact the root of Evil. To put it better, evil continues precisely because of its inherent rootlessness, its constitutive disregard of the world.  Thus, the detachment of claims such as \\"Anybody could have done what Eichmann did\\" distort her intention.  Evil, she insists, is not an inevitable aspect of human nature, but instead arises from an unwillingness to understand.

B000W4KT6E|3.0|I know that we are all supposed to love this movie because the critics say it's great but I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed as the credits began to run.  There are some funny sequences and there are some fun moments, and I must admit that when the film opened to young Tracy Turnblad singing good morning to Baltimore I was in movie musical heaven but as the film continued to drag on I felt like they were trying to hard to be the `anti-Dreamgirls'.  Now I love `Dreamgirls', but my main complaint for `Dreamgirls' was that once you take away the singing you have what I like to call `barely a film' left.<br /><br />`Hairspray' tries to remedy that by teaching us the pain and sufferings caused by segregation and trying to show the power one voice can have in making a difference.  I wouldn't say that it failed in this attempt, but it just seemed to get lost at times within its own cause.  I slowed down the fun and brought on the sap in moments that just didn't mesh right with me and what I wanted to see.  In the end it in a way accomplished what it was after but along the way it made me feel kind of awkward, and unexplainable `I should be having fun, right?' kind of awkward.<br /><br />The story, as most of you probably know, is about young Tracy Turnblad, an overweight unpopular girl who dreams of dancing on the Corny Collins show.  She gets her chance when one of the girls drops out for `just nine months' and so she auditions.  The producer Velma von Tussle and her daughter Amber are not impresses with Tracy.  They insult her and send her home.  After one of the stars of the show sees her dancing at school though she is prompted to dance in front of Corny Collins himself and is given a spot on the show.  Tracy becomes an overnight sensation and she inspires many people to invest in their own dreams.<br /><br />Right off the bat my wife and I noticed something I found slightly humorous and I wonder if it was intentional.  Nikki Blonsky (our young star) sounds like a cartoon heroine when she sings, like Ariel in the flesh, while Michelle Pfeiffer (arguably the best thing about this film) sings like a cartoon villain.  It's just a little tidbit I found entertaining.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky performs beautifully.  She's energetic and endearing, just like she needed to be.  In fact I'm impressed with just about everyone onscreen except for the one everyone keeps talking about.  I honestly felt that John Travolta blew this one.  He sounded like a drag queen and just went way over the top.  The best thing that can be said about his performance is that it's fearless.  Sometimes it's good to have a little fear.  Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as Velma von Tussle.  She's sly and dastardly, I just love it.  Christopher Walken is wasted here for he rarely does anything on screen really, which is a shame because he's amazing, and Queen Latifah pretty much reprises her role from `Chicago' just without the `vavavoom' that got her an Oscar nomination the first time around.  Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Elijah Kelley...Taylor Parks...they all do what they need to do and they do it well.  I can see why the girls love little Zac Efron, he is a, oh what do they say, `cutey' and Brittany Snow was just spot on as the devilish Amber von Tussle.  Pfeiffer and Snow made a great team.<br /><br />`Hairspray' sure has its moments of musical bliss, and it has its catastrophes of full fledged corniness so it's up to you to decide how you feel about the film.  Many a critic has lauded this as one of the best films of the year.  I say \\"no\\" to that, but it was entertaining to say the least.  It tries really hard to be a great film and succeeds in being a good film so I guess that counts for something.ine when she sings, like Ariel in the flesh, while Michelle Pfeiffer (arguably the best thing about this film) sings like a cartoon villain.

0740748475|5.0|I am soooo ticked right now!  I have been waiting and waiting and waiting to order this book -- Amazon had a decent price of between $80 - $90, but that was still too high for me.  Today a friend told me she got an e-mail alert from Amazon that it was on sale for today only (I got no such alert, although it is on all my lists, and I get all kinds of other Amazon alerts.)  So I came on and checked, and lo and behold!  It was $67.50!  I was thrilled.  I put it in my cart, and then I made the cardinal mistake of continuing to shop for a few other items, thinking I'd get them all on one shipment.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  When I went to checkout, I get the big yellow box saying \\"Important Message!  The item you put in your cart earlier has now increased in price.\\"  Now it's back to $82 or something.  I am so sick!!!!  I know they do this, and other onlines also, but it seems to me as if once it's in your cart, it should be the same price for at least 24 hours.  Grrrrrrrr....  So this gripe is directed to Amazon, not the Calvin & Hobbes book, which I have perused at length at bookstores and found it to be wonderful.  I'm going to go bang my forehead into the wall ala Calvin's mom now...
B000OVLBGC|5.0|When `Das Leben der Anderen' (The Lives of Others) won the Oscar last year for Best Foreign Film I was shocked to say the least.  I hadn't actually heard much about the film until Oscar night and since `Pan's Labyrinth' was so widely known and the expected winner I just couldn't see it being dethroned, and then it was.  At the time I hadn't seen either film but the general consensus was that `Pan's Labyrinth' was a masterpiece and so I was actually a little upset at the upset Oscar night.  Now that I have seen `Das Leben der Anderen' I can honestly say that I am no longer upset but thrilled that it is an Oscar winning film.  `Das Leben der Anderen' is one of the finest films I've seen in years and sports some of the finest performances to be cemented on film.  It's intriguing, enthralling and captivating from start to finish and is, in a word, flawless.<br /><br />The film takes place during 1984 in Berlin.  The East German Secret Police (or the Stasi) have ordered agent Gerd Wiesler to wiretap Georg Dreyman, a successful playwright, and his girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, to uncover whether or not they are a danger to the government.  There man not be any reason to suggest or accuse either of them of seditious thinking or actions but the mere fact that Minister Bruno Hempf has a personal interest in Sieland (a very personal interest) is reason enough to order to investigation.  This deep prying into their personal lives leads to some very devastating consequences that all could have, and should have, been avoided.<br /><br />The film beautifully fleshes out each character here and draws the audience into what is unfolding on the screen.  Ulrich Muhe (who sadly passed away shortly after the film was released) has received much praise and many accolades for his performance as Gerd Wiesler, the distraught Stasi agent spying on the couple.  As he further implants himself in their lives he begins to weigh out the pointlessness of his own existence and begins to wonder if what he believes is really what he should believe.  His performance is human, it's real, but it's not the best performance here.  Martina Gedeck has also received much praise for her portrayal of young actress Christa-Maria Sieland.  You can read the emotions that run across her face, the anger, the disbelief, the fear, the regret.  She is a revelation here, but she does not give the best performance here either.<br /><br />The top honors, in my humble opinion, are reserved for Sebastian Koch, who nails Georg Dreyman masterfully.  As the troubled writer struggling with his own views and those of the ones around him Koch makes Dreyman someone we can all relate to, and rationalize with.  There is so much to be told about this man, and so much is riding on this solitary performance.  We know that the Minister is fascinated with Sieland, but Wiesler is obsessed with Dreyman, and so it's up to Koch to let the audience know why.  Koch does just that.  His body language is effortless and captivating, his voice is empowering, his mannerisms, the way he floats from thought to spoken word is just pure brilliance.  Sebastian Koch gives one of, if not the finest performance I've seen this year.<br /><br />`Das Leben der Anderen' is beautifully written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in a way that not only draws the audience but makes them a part what's going on.  What he has done with his debut film is something many directors never accomplish, not in the entire span of their careers.  You will find yourself as personally invested in this story as Wiesler is, as absorbed in the lives of Dreyman and Sieland and even Wiesler himself and will ultimately be asking yourselves questions that only a masterpiece such as `Das Leben der Anderen' can illicit, questions about life, decisions and consequences and how we as human beings would react if given the opportunity.to wonder if what he believes is really what he should believe.

B000TGCR38|4.0|For a film that was twenty years in the making so-to-speak I was a little disappointed with the one thing that time should have perfected; the script.  If you take the finished product from about twenty minutes in and about twenty minutes shy of the credits you have a near perfect film, intriguing and entertaining and completely absorbing.  If you think about the first and the last twenty minutes though you have frustration, or at least I do.<br /><br />The beginning is, in my opinion, a little rushed.  I would have loved to have seen Rachel's character fleshed out a little more in the opening sequences, so that I could get a handle on who she really was and what it was in her life that made her the woman we meet.  The ending seems to drag on a bit too long with plot twist after plot twist that could have easily have been condensed in order for more attention to have been given to, say, the beginning of the film.  In all fairness though this is quite an adventurous undertaking, and the concept behind this film could have easily filled a trilogy so fitting so much in a near three hour film is a hard thing to do.  So, when taking this into consideration `Zwartboek' (`Black Book') is really a rewarding spectacle.<br /><br />The film follows a young Jewish woman named Rachel Stein who witnesses the brutal murder of her family and friends and miraculously survives.  She joins the Dutch Resistance in an attempt to avenge her family's death and in the process becomes involved with two very different yet equally intriguing men.  She is immediately attracted to a member of the Resistance, Hans Akkermans, but she is assigned to infiltrate the Gestapo by seducing SS-Official Ludwig Muntze.  Muntze is charming and handsome and is obviously infatuated with Rachel (who is going by the name of Ellis de Vries) even after uncovering her Jewish heritage.  Rachel manages to uncover information that helps the Resistance but her efforts aren't always met with success and a sudden twist leaves her an enemy of both the Gestapo and the Resistance.<br /><br />Carice van Houten nails her performance here with grace and empowerment.  I was blown away by her immaculate presence, her determination to the role and her range of varying emotions that transcend words; and when she sings (and yes she did all her own singing) I was in heaven.  She was the perfect complement to Sebastian Koch's magnificence.  Koch is turning out to be my German Russell Crowe, an actor who just holds my attention with every inch of his person.  He's as beautiful to look at as he is to watch perform and this only adds to his magnetism.  His performance as Ludwig Muntze is intense and commanding.  He really makes this man someone we can easily fall in love with, someone we can understand and relate to and want to see more of.  Thom Hoffman also nails his performance as Hans.  He shows a great range of emotions, from infatuation to determination to jealous distain.  Other performances worth recognizing are that of Halina Reijn who plays Rachel's friend Ronnie and Waldemar Kobus who plays Gunther Franken with such flaunted despicability you can't help but be entranced by his presence.<br /><br />`Zwartboek' is a beautiful film to watch.  Every frame holds your attention and forces you to admire what director Paul Verhoeven is accomplishing (or trying to accomplish) here.  It's sexy and provocative and comes across like a guilty pleasure, which is a very good thing.  The cinematography is just orgasmic, everything feeling so real, a real that only Hollywood can portray.  I do wish that the film were longer, if only to flesh out the story behind the story, the story that is Rachel Stein.  I would have loved to have learnt more about her.  I know that that was not the purpose of the film and I do know that a film should focus on one aspect of a story and not give us so much that we lose interest and or find ourselves lost, I guess I just felt so intrigued by what I saw that I want to know more.  I feel that with a little tweak in the script it could have been, from start to finish, perfection.little tweak in the script it could have been, from start to finish, perfection.

B000AARKOO|5.0|Unfortunately this film did not become a major hit at the box office. Yet, it has many fine points which makes it a worthwhile viscerally intense viewing experience. Likely at the time, the public was inundated with sexually appealing epics such as \\"The Gladiator\\" and \\"Alexander\\". \\"The Kingdom of Heaven\\" deserves a closer look for its presentation of the historically important Crusades,  which is the clash of Christianity against Islam in a very volatile region of the world, Palestine, now modern Israel. In the end, the Moslems show mercy on the Christians after a long and bloody battle. There is a very wise and universal message here presented by Saladin, a Moslem leader, which is important for modern times for all of humanity.<br /><br />This rich and deeply moving epic film shows the magnitude and impact of the Crusades on the lives of specific individuals, countries, and the world.  Orlando Bloom is cast as Balian, a French blacksmith, who's wife committed suicide after the death of their child. Per the Catholic religion, she is not allowed proper burial. Her wrapped body is placed at the crossroads as an example to all. Balian is enraged and exacts his revenge upon the clergy when he sees her necklace (with a crucifix) on one of the priests. These events shake his faith in God. In despair, he leave his homeland ...<br /><br />On the road, Balian encounters Crusaders, among whom is the injured knight named Baron Godrey of Ibelin (played by Liam Neeson). Balian learns Godfrey is his father, who is now dying. The scene where Balian prays on a mountainside, entreating God for guidance and to strengthen his faith is very powerful and moving. In another very emotional and solemn ceremony, Balian is blessed by his father and is beknighted not long before his father succombs to battle wounds. Liam Neeson's performance is magnificent, he is totally believable in the role).<br /><br />Priot to arriving in Jerusalem, Balian encounters the enemy in the desert, a Moslem,  with whom he fights and on whom he shows mercy, by not murdering him, instead he takes his horse. Balian learns of the political differences which exist bewteen the Crusaders who are divided into two camps of how to win Jerusalem for Christianity. On his travels in the city, he meets a beautiful Moslem woman Sybella (played to perfection by Eva Green) on horseback. Learning she is the sister to the king, who has leprosy, and is the wife of one of the more influential Europeans whose closeness to the king, gives him an advantage during the political unrest in the region -- their destinies are sure to cross again ...<br /><br />The battle scenes between the Crusaders and Moslems are immense in scope and depth. Balian becomes the leader of the Crusaders against the major battle with Saladin, the Moslem leader. Balian also has a secret liason/ relationship with Sybella - despite her married status and unique position ... Overall, this film has much to offer the viewer interested in an exciting emotionally engaging viewing experience.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|Persuasion is my favorite novel by the astounding Jane Austen.  I loved the older adaptation and wondered how this version would meet my expectations.  I was amazed and entranced with the actors, the script, and the added subtulties the movie provided.  I ended the movie with tears in my eyes.  You will not waste your time with this movie.  I ordered this DVD before it was available in the states and programmed my DVD player to play region 2.  I couldn't wait.  I even pre-ordered the region 1 version so I can watch it on my big screen.
159102594X|3.0|First the good. Joe is a gifted writer who creates witty and punchy dialogue between interesting and quirky characters. In fact, his character development is great, they draw you into the book, hoping to see what happens to them. This brings me to the bad.    The bad, there is no story. Ok, that's a little harsh, but there is barely a plot. The books suffers from so many new characters being introduced that the flow of the story is hampered. To be honest, the book is one big set up for the sequel to come. (or so it felt to me)    I was so distracted by the number of characters introduced. In fact, I disagree with the reviewer before me, he lists who the main characters are in his review and if you would ask me, some of those people I would not name as main characters. One if fact didn't show up until the end of the book.    I give it three stars because of the writing and I hope that the next book will overcome this distracted, fragmented plot and start to flow more evenly (now that the characters are out, make them do something)    I'll wait to see the other reviews before I buy book two.
B000VI70WM|2.0|Well, like everyone else that has posted a review on this album, I was hesitant to embrace this release, especially since I found out that Timbaland and Justin Timberlake had direct involvement in the production of the album. For the record, I am not a fan of either Timbaland and Justin.   And yes, I'm one of those \\"old-time\\" Duran Duran fans that caught on to Duran Duran in the New Wave heydays of this band.      After listening to the album several times (at the advice of some of the other reviewers), I discovered that some of the songs appeal to a much younger element that enjoy today's sound.  My teenagers thought \\"Skin Divers\\", \\"The Valley\\", and \\"Nite Runner\\" were fantastic songs; but, I hated these songs, as I thought it was a desperate plea by \\"near fifty year old\\" musicians to get in tune with the kids from today.  However, there were a couple of tracks that did sound like the Duran Duran that I knew and grew up with, these songs being, \\"Dirty Great Monster\\", \\"Fallin' Down\\", and \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\".  With the exception of \\"Box Full O' Honey\\", the rest of the album is very forgettable and unimpressive.    This is an an album that I feel like will rate with \\"Liberty\\", which bombed in 1990 and \\"Thank You\\", which bombed in 1997.  If you are interested in true Duran Duran classics, I would strongly recommend the 1981 Duran Duran, Rio, Seven And The Ragged Tiger, Notorious, and Astronaut.  The 1981-1985 CD with the Night Versions and B-Sides is also very powerful in the DD catalogue.  I know that one of the reviewers stated that it's not 1987 anymore, but this reviewer needs to bear in mind that the 80s completely DEFINED this band, no matter how many times DD attempts to \\"redefine\\" themselves in 2007 and beyond.    I gave this album 2 stars even though it deserves 1 star for quality of output.  The other star is for the admiration of DD attempting to connect with today's generation.  I just wonder if when this album \\"bombs\\" on the charts, will DD wonder if it was worth it to alienate its huge, established 80s fan base.  Maybe the power of the dollar will encourage this band to get back to the sound that they are best known for.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is one of those movies that I remember I LOVED when I was a kid, but did not know if I would feel the same way about as an adult. It took a chance and bought willow on Amazon for really cheap. It holds up to my memories as being a great and exciting movie.  Great for kids and adults alike. I highly recommend!!
B000W4KT64|4.0|From its opening song to its closing moral, this musical period piece succeeds in every way. Set in urban Baltimore in 1962, Tracy Turnblad is an overweight but vivacious teenager who dances in front of her TV as she watches the Corny Collins Show. If only she could have such a life! When the show has an opening, she auditions, gets the part, and, to the chagrin of the cool crowd, causes the show's ratings to skyrocket. Tracy is irrepressible and impossible not to love. She also has an eye for fairness, like dumping the show's Negro Day. She ads a gentle but direct moral to the musical. Looking back to 1962, the film deconstructs any number of prejudices, including race, gender, class, media, family, friendship, and especially body image. When Tracy begs her obese Mom (played by John Travolta) to be her agent, she declines since she has hardly left the house in decades. Tracy insists: \\"Mom, it's changing out there, you'll like it. People who are different, their time is coming.\\" Mom leaves the house and exclaims, \\"there's so much air our here!\\" Hairspray is fun, energetic, nostalgic, and, believe it or not, even meaningful. With a PG rating it makes for fun family viewing and good discussion.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|The brilliance of this particular film is that it makes any argument against it seem petty. The only extreme \\"socialist\\" and unnecessary service was perhaps the French \\"laundry and mommy maid\\" scenes in France.<br />If its this bad for americans with health insurance then how bad must it be for those without? That question is left for you to ponder and as someone who has no health insurance ill tell you its a nightmare. Micheal Moore puts partisan views aside and attacks both republicans and dems equally- Hillary Clinton gets held to the flame and one wonders if she won would she follow through with universal \\"healthcare\\". Critics will say \\"socialist\\" this or \\"handout\\" that\\" but the film just solely argues for health care- not for other controversial social services. If it doesnt piss you off that Al-queda detainees receive better health care than your 9/11 volunteers or someone like myself who has always worked never asked for welfare and cant afford insurance then i dont know what to say. Its simply put- people or profit- charity or greed. For a so-called christian nation, what do you think Jesus would choose? Moore makes the case through the obvious- emotional stories of our failed system. For those who already have heatlh insurance id view this movie because youre not safe by any means!<br /><br />The only thing i thought that was left out was the treatment of some of our Vietnam or Iraq war veterans. Both have suffered from agent orange and other unknown chemical poisoning and were denied medical care by our government who said the symptoms were unfound and not \\"war related\\". This injustice was not mentioned and could have been presented in the movie.
B000PC8AFU|4.0|It isn't the BEST THING that's come out featurning SRV, but come on!  It isn't a bad assortment of performances at all and I actually enjoyed it (listened for the first time today). I love when new stuff comes out and this one has things that I'd either not heard before, hadn't heard in a long time or hadn't heard in this version.  I'm a crazy SRV fan for sure...but not that crazy!

0316067598|5.0|Our family is desperately hoping to see the movie in the very near future.  May God bless Marcus, his family and all the families of those heros who lost their lives.  And, may God damn the liberal media and politicians which have  cost these lives and those of so many others in this war.  The book was well written, informative, distressing and ought to be required reading for every looney liberal bleeding heart and the liberal media that constantly undermine the efforts of our troops and this war on terror.  This story makes one very angry - reminiscent of \\"Blackhawk Down\\" - and certainly should be made into a movie;but most likely will not be since we all know the liberal loonies command the movie industry.
B000QCUB8I|5.0|Like many of you, I was extremely disapointed with Daft Punk's Human after all. I have been looking for a band that has their same flavor with something new mixed in.....This, ladies and gentelmen, is it.     Justice's Cross has mixed the best parts of the 70s (lovely orchestral strings) the 80s(think robots and synthisizers) and the beats of the early 90s with the bass of the late 90s and turned it into a materpeice. Now, i know the 70s and 80s don't sound like cool-times BUT somehow Justice has managed to clean it up. THe whole thing will leave you electronically satisfied, for sure.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|CASINO ROYALE (2006) is the best James Bond film EVER!     Question: There's two discs but no deleted scenes or quality special features? What's the deal with that?     Answer: Sony/MGM just wants us to buy the Ultimate Edition DVD. What a rip-off!    Great film, poor DVD. ****
B00082IJ08|4.0|Lots of tracks with a diverse collection of songs, all expertly performed and arranged.  An upbeat soundtrack to add to your mix and kudos to the band for their innovative take on alternative rap.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I read David Grohl's take on Zeppelin and he believed in Zeppelin, but questioned God while at studying at a catholic school!     Seeing this dvd for the first time actually brought me to tears! I was born in the late 60's and unfortunately unable to see Zeppelin in their heyday. This dvd provided an excellent glimpse of what energy they had live.     A must have for any Zep fan.
B000002B2T|5.0|I first heard this album in a drafting class in high school. A friend had on his headphones as we all listened to music in the class and I asked him what he was listening to. He said Mad Season and I had never heard of them before. He handed me the headphones and Wake Up was playing. I demanded to borrow the CD and bought it soon after. Some of Layne Staley's best lyrics and all of the contributing musicians just do an incredible job. Give it a listen.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|With so many positive reviews, my words can hardly add anything. So I'll just say the music written for this film is sublime and the piano playing superb. The repeating melodic theme is simple yet hauntingly beautiful. Included here is one track of such rare beauty that it's hard to believe it wasn't from the hand of Beethoven or Mozart; it's the music for Darcy and Elizabeth's first dance at Mr. Bingley's ball. It's transporting, as is the entire CD.
B00005JPFH|5.0|Well done continuation of the series.  Loved the new characters and pleased to see many of the same characters from the previous two movies.  The special effects are quite impressive.  A must see for comic book enthusiasts!

B000W07EKW|5.0|The Bourne trilogy is an action packed, no-nonsense, saga that follows the protagonist, Jason Bourne, on a whirlwind adventure across the world. Strangely, he is simultaneously fighting to find who he is and running from the secrets he unburies. These movies put you in the grit and chaos of a post-Cold War spy game that plays out in some of the most thrilling locales in the world. The characters are relentless and, unlike other spy movies, the imperative behind their actions will strike a nerve with even the most callous movie-goer. The movies are not about grand schemes to overthrow the existing regime. Rather, they are about survival, finding out who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, and if there really is a difference. The confusion and chaos of clandestine ops is clearly exaggerated, but it also never felt so good.
0374530718|5.0|I don't give five stars lightly, but this book deserves them.  The only thing I find lacking a little is that the few explanations of physical phenomena to be found in the book, leave something to be desired. But the philosophy is very well explained, without the usual technical jargon that makes it difficult to digest for the beginner. If you have a \\"love of wisdom\\" (that's what philosophy means,) and some inclination for abstract thinking, this book can serve a very good short introduction to the subject. At the same time, the story interwoven with the philosophy classes is very very imaginative, and makes you want to keep reading to know how will all end.<br />Several things are left unresolved. For instance, will Alberto and Sophie be able to go back to the real world? Are her mother and friends also part of the \\"ghost world\\"? I got the impression at the end that the author was thinking on a sequel. I'd love a sequel on a more detailed treatment of analytical philosophy and logical positivism, including the work of Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russel, Rudolf Carnap , A. J. Ayer and Willard van Orman Quine. He could throw in a little propositional logic for good measure. The story should continue with the same characters of course.<br />And why stop there? He could have a sequel on the concepts of Math and another on Physics, for example.  :-)  Just kidding, but I liked the style of the presentation so much, that the idea of the sequels came to me. I might be tempted some day on writing the Math and Physics parts myself, without plagiarizing of course.
B000W1V44I|5.0|Simply the best!<br />Better than all the rest!<br />What more can I say?
0525950079|4.0|I've just finished this book, and while it was an enjoyable read, it was not nearly as good as Follett's earlier work, \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" [[ASIN:B000FML7WS PILLARS OF THE EARTH]].    Both novels are placed in medieval England, with \\"World Without End\\" being the sequal to \\"Pillars.\\" Both novels are actually very similar in plot and structure, enough so that it begs comparison. And, \\"World Without End\\" suffers in that respect. The plot is not as interesting, the characters aren't as compelling, and the ending is not as satisfying. All in all, if you've read the earlier book, this one is fairly predictable.    Having said all this, it's not a bad book... it's just not nearly as good as \\"Pillars\\" and, if you're a Follett fan as I am, you'll acknowledge that it isn't one of his more compelling works.    So... if you've read everything else Follett and want to read this, go ahead. It's reasonably entertaining. If you're looking for a good Follett book and you haven't read much of his work, then \\"Pillars\\" is a much better place to go, as is \\"Eye of the Needle\\" [[ASIN:006074815X Eye of the Needle]].
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is amazing! If you watch it you will be inducted into the reality of war in a way you will never forget: the hardship, anticipation, terror, determination, courage, and grinding routine of the foot-slogger at war.<br /><br />And at the end of it you will respect the men who fought that war, citizen-soldiers all, who did the job at hand and stuck with it to the very end. An outstanding story to begin with, and a classic in its own right.
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|Why the hell is this JJ (see above) bitching above something he didn't even buy, and reviewing an artist he doesn't care about!?!<br /><br />This Taylor Swift Special Edition is a Must Have for every Taylor Swift fan as it has 3 new songs not on the first CD release, plus a new additional DVD video disc. The DVD contains Taylor first 3 music videos: Tim McGraw, Teardrops on my Guitar and Our Song. Plus it has the behind the scenes making of the music videos, personal Taylor home videos and interviews, and a really excellent GAC TV program about Taylor growing up and how she got started. Well worth it!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I have to admit, I have been pretty harsh on Britney with everything she has gone through in her personal life. But I have to say after listening to this album at least musically Britney is back!!     This is easily Britney's best album to date and sure to be the best album of 2007 and most likely will remain the best album of 2008 also. It seems like all the other young pop stars out there are trying to copy Britney with dance pop albums. You have Ashlee Simpson, Avril Lavigne, Hilary Duff, and others all putting out dance/pop albums but Britney is the one and only original. Those other girls owe whatever success they have to Britney and that's what makes Britney a legend.     Blackout is a very strong album and there isn't one song I don't like on it. I feel every song on the album could be a hit single. Besides the obvious hit Gimme More my favorite tracks would be Toy Soldier, Hot as Ice, and Piece of Me. However, every song on the album is awesome. I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear a fun dance/pop album from the legend herself. This album leaves me saying GIMME MORE!!!!!!
B000EPFPYW|1.0|This is NOT a Japanese pressing! As stated previously, this is simply an American CD wrapped in Japanese label. Save your cash and purchase a cheaper version.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have no idea how I came across this series, but I couldn't be happier with it.  The story is similar to that of Pride and Prejudice and the shooting is very much like the style of the BBC P&P too.  All together a very easy flowing mini-series and universal storyline.  I really and truly enjoyed every aspect of it and loved the characters.  I fell in love with John Thorton's transformation.  His introduction was so violent that I was sure I would dislike the character, but the slow change and the insight was so well done.  I'm a sap for stories like this, but have high expections too.  This DVD really met them all.
0143038419|5.0|A brave and bold, unapologetic account of a woman's journey to finding and following her inner voice.  A story about the transition out of a comfortable but disgenuine life to one's right path.  What consisted of a personal crisis for the author was unimportant to me. Instead, it was the universal dilemma of a woman (or person, for that matter) making the excruciating choice to either a.) ignore the aching/dulling painful secret that one is living a lie of a life that does not represent who they really are, or b.) risk greatly, upset the order around oneself in order to courageously face that CHANGE is needed to live a genuine and personally satisfying life in true represention of who you really are.  THE LATTER, PLEASE - I've only got this one life to live, after all!  I am surprised by some reviews that focus on and criticize the author for what they view is narcissistic whining simply because they feel her unhappy marriage was not means for a breakdown, or  that other people have it worse, \\"get over yourself\\", etc.  But do we not each bear our own burden?  How can one ever estimate what any circumstance feels like or means to another?  That we each must know and follow our TRUE voice is paramount to me and a lesson this book offers anyone willing to share in its humanity. This book is a personal account of \\"me, me, me\\" because it was \\"her, her, her\\" journey!  I appreciate, for one, this woman sharing her experience in such an honest way that it freed me to do a bit more of the same for myself.  I highly recommend this read!
B00000J7A2|5.0|These guys really hit the right notes with me. This album is so folk oriented, yet so blues-rockful at the same time, it's perfect. I'm a huge fan of the unconventional blues (i.e. Black Sabbath and The Stooges). It was actually their song, 'Yellow Brick Road,' which I heard on a 60's net radio station that attracted me to them in the first place. Captian Beefheart speaks about the nitty-gritty* of love with compassion, in his *gritty-throat voice. The musicians in this band are so under-rated, and yet so talented... why hasn't anyone ever told us about these guys before? Overall, yes, I agree with the reviews, this should be one of the best rock albums ever, especially for being a blues/folk album coming out of the psychedelic ear. Admist many of the bands of the late 60s and early 70s experimenting with similar sounds, Captian Beefheart and his Magical Band craftily make 'Blues' and 'Rock' completely an American thing.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|To the one person whou gave it one star because of a download problem:  for petes sake, don't rate the movie based on the completely separate download process!  Go rate the unbox service if you really feel you have to.    As far as the movie goes, this is one of the movies I watch EVERY christmas.  Chevy Chase is very funny, and the rest of the members in his extended family are also very good.  Every family has their problems during christmas, but watching this family's hilarious experiences makes me really appreciate christmas that much more.
B00005JPNW|4.0|Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) is a stubborn girl who wants to be included in the adventures of her uncle, the Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig). For one particularly important mission Lord Asriel heads to \\"The North,\\" and again Lyra is left behind. Her savior comes in the form of a woman, the Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who says she is about to travel to the North and could use an assistant. For safety on her voyage with Mrs. Coulter, Lyra is given a strange instrument and told to keep it a secret. The instrument is an Alethiometer and if you can read it, it always shows you the truth. With the help of the Alethiometer and some new friends she meets along the way, Lyra must find and save kidnapped children and then find her uncle.     The movie is based on the world created by Philip Pullman in the His Dark Materials series, a three-book set with The Golden Compass being the first. While I have not read the books, I will assume that much of the movie was as it was in the books. For example, I will credit Pullman with the dæmons -- in this parallel world a person's soul travels alongside the body, in animal form, rather than inside it. This was a wildly imaginative element to the story and one of those \\"Why didn't I come up with that?\\" ideas.     I really like Daniel Craig, but he is not in the movie very long. You get the impression that he might get more on-screen time later in the story, but Lyra is our star. As Lyra, Dakota Blue Richards was everything she needed to be, when she need to be. She was stubborn, sassy, strong, and lots of other things that don't start with the letter S.     I don't like Nicole Kidman. In almost every role she is sneaky, rude, cold and nasty. And that is exactly how she was in The Golden Compass, and I loved it. Mrs. Coulter is each and every one of those things.     The animation for the movie was very well done. There were many parts of the movie where the animators could have made it look less animated, but they didn't. I thinkit added to the fantasy element of the story to keep it this way.     The story moves pretty quickly. There is a lot of information packed into just one movie. Normally I would gripe about the lack of depth given to certain parts of the plot, but I am making an exception for The Golden Compass under the assumption that things will be explained in the next two installments of the series.     It was PG-13 and the only reason I could see was for animated violence. Many people died, but there was little or no blood.     You can call this a children's movie if you want, but I think it is time we re-evaluated that category. You will like this movie if you like fun fantasy/adventure stories. I loved it.
B000VSYDRM|3.0|This movie is simply ok.  It is a bit slow going, and to tell you the truth I found my mind wandering in several places in the movie.  Yes, the settings are very nice, and you can indeed feel the grit and the poverty of the lowly minions that toil away in servitude within the bowels of the city.  What turned me off of this movie was the ending, which completely went into la-la land.  I was expecting a much different ending, one where the main character perhaps came to see that his search for the perfect perfume was not worth the lives he took to get it.  I'm sure the high-brow folks will mock me, saying the ending was \\"artistic\\", but I found it to be completely absurd.
B000SSPL0I|5.0|...although the earlier of Leontyne Price's two recordings runs it close.This is one of the three or four most satisfying recordings of this great, sprawling opera - and two of the others also feature Tebaldi. To hear her at her very best, you need to go to the legendary 1953 live set, thrillingly conducted by Mitropoulos - Del Monaco also is stunning here - but the sound is pretty rough and Aldo Protti merely adequate compared with the burnished, nut-brown tones of Bastianini. This 1955 Decca studio recording, in excellent stereo sound, is very good - I cannot believe how snooty some critics (especially my compatriot British ones who rave about weedy, effete voices like those of Pears, Bostridge and their like) are about Del Monaco in this, probably his best role after Otello; to me he is tremendous, but it has to be said that for sheer glamour, Corelli tops him in the 1958 Hardy recording with the same conductor (also available on black & white DVD) which is in good, live sound but obviously not as pleasant a listening experience as this. The cast assembled is without peer even if Molinari-Pradelli's conducting is nothing special and Tebaldi is certainly in fresher voice than in 1958. We are spoilt for choice with recordings of this opera, as, in addition to the earlier Price set, there is also the Callas version with a good, if not quite so spectacular, cast let down by Rossi-Lemeni's woolly Padre Guardiano and a baritone past his best. After over 50 years, this remains the best bet, in many ways.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|If you are curious about The Clash this is the album to start with.  London Calling is (arguably) one of the top 5 rock albums of all time.  Personally, I rank it second, just behind Exile On Main Street and in front of Revolver.  The Clash are generally described as a punk band. This is a limiting tag - The Damned and the Sex Pistols were punk, The Clash were a punk-influenced rock band who secretly smoked pot.  They managed, on this album, to create the greatest working-class rock album of all time.    The lyrics evoke a history that spans the Crusades through Thatcher's Britain  but still seem to resonate in Bush's America.  From Spanish Bombs through Guns Of Brixton to Four Horsemen, this album is an oblique anti-fascist statement that rocks much harder than the average statement.    Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world,  Ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl.  Love 'n hate tattooed across the knuckles of his hands,  Hands that slap his kids around, 'cause they don't understand how,  Death or glory, becomes just another story.
0805079831|5.0|The author ties so many well researched and documented things together in our modern world history in a way that I never imagined. She deserves much credit for her insight, scholarship, and readability. You can't help but to be frustrated that more people are not using it as a starting point for action to correct the wrongs of the past and to protect ourselves from future injustices.  I'm so glad that I bought this book, and am recommending it as highly as I can.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blockus is one of those games that gets under your skin in a good way. You want to play it. It's addictive. You can master it fairly easily if you understand a few simple principles about how to control spaces and how to place pieces on the board.<br /><br />For example, things that can help considerably are identifying the pieces you have and reminding yourself to put the pieces that will probably cause you trouble the most in the late game, put them down on the board asap. A real complex shape is not likely to get placed late in the game, and there's  a limited amount of room depending on how everyone's laying down pieces.<br /><br />It really is a fantastic game and it's given my family no end of fun and many hours of play and conversation. It's one that even someone not trying that hard can win. Sometimes we play purely on instinct rather than strategy and it's just as interesting and rewarding.<br /><br />If you just can't get Chess, you'll probably be able to get this. If you want to try it out first, try the Blokus online game, which is available at the Blockus Web site. Try searching for Blockus Online and see what you get. You can play several different kinds of Blockus, as well as the travel version online, and that's addicting as well.
0618680004|4.0|I hardly need say that this is a passionately, brilliantly argued and absolutely necessary book. 95% of it I was nodding along with like a toy dog in a car going over speed bumps at 100mph.    But curiously it's the other 5% that's made me think again, and left me less certain about the absence of some purposeful mechanism behind it all than I was before. Not Yahweh, or whatever, obviously.    It comes towards the end when he gives the quotation about the universe being a whole lot weirder than we can even begin to imagine. Well, as I was reading it, and coming to terms with multiverses and atoms whose neutron is like a fly in the middle of a football stadium, I couldn't help but think that some mechanism of which we have no conception whatsoever, perhaps like something out of the Cthulhu mythos of H P Lovecraft might, for all we know, be kicking around out there. Of course it changes nothing of any importance, like evolution, or the big bang, or the insanity of organised religions, etc. And we'll never know, so so what? But the fact that Dawkins cannot categorically deny that something could always come before something still leaves some wiggle room unfortunately.    Then there's the feeling that, say what he might, I can't think of any atheist regime that's provided a helpful beacon in the history of existence. There's modern day China and Russia recently. In a way countries like Australia and the U.K. today come close, and there's some consolation in that I suppose. But since religion gives people a reason to get out of bed in the morning, I can't help thinking that the only real replacement is getting out of bed to make money. It's all right for Dawkins - he's a brilliant scientist. What about the rest of us - the truth is it's hard not to rely on something external to make your life make sense.    Then there's the point about religion as consolation. I don't buy Dawkins' argument that my mother would have been immeasurably happier at the end of a life being cutshort by disease if she'd thought she was never going to see me again. And I'm interested to know what he'd have said in my shoes - \\"is not science enough, mother?\\" I think of Captain Scott dying at the South Pole, tormented and unhappy, while his two companions, Bowers and Wilson, were totally at peace in their deluded religious state. They were wrong and Scott was right of course, of course - but who in the end was really right?    I think England got it right by compromising. They didn't thunder in like China or Russia and drive religion underground, they gradually let it wither on the vine, so all that was left in the end was vicars in tweed jackets pottering around being nice to old ladies on push bikes. That was the most effective way to kill religion. By charging against it like a bull at a gate, despite the clarity of thinking, the sincerity, the honesty, I feel that Dawkins unintentionally makes the other lot dig their heels in further and further. One of the reasons religions take off in the first place is because ignorant people don't like being patronised - look at the Sudanese baying for blood in revenge against their old colonial masters the other week. By his intellectually hectoring tone, Dawkins is alienating many of the people he most needs to reach out to.    I don't question his thesis. I'm a little surprised that he's made me slightly less atheist, but that's OK. I do question his tactics and his tone.
1593080492|5.0|I picked up this book largely due to fond memories of [[ASIN:0743487591 Pride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)]], but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.<br /><br />The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.<br /><br />I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.<br /><br />In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading.
0060558121|5.0|Nothing more to say other than this book was great. I couldn't step away from it.
B000UR9TQO|3.0|The two DVDs are great, the extras are a nice surprise and the gadgets are very good, but the packaging is very poor.  The box material is too light and arrived with many damages, the gadgets are mixed togheter without any order and the free poster offer only for US is quite disappointing for an European fan.  I would have paid more for a better packaging without any doubt.
0525950079|2.0|So I really liked Pillars of the Earth.  I will admit that I was a little turned off by the sex scenes, but I got a cheap copy and made myself an expurgated version that I can read without worries.  The point is that I knew going into it that this book would have more sex scenes than I would be comfortable with.      The reason I liked Pillars was because it gave me a sense of the social and political history of the time while entertaining me with likable characters struggling against overwhelming odds.  I especially liked the overarching theme of architecture -- it gave the book structure and grand scope.    In the new book, the connecting theme is missing.  It's just a series of setbacks for our heroes -- none of whom is particularly likable in the first place.  Of the four children the book starts with, one is an unredeemed bully who gets everything he ever wanted until the very end when he gets his just deserts.  One is a poor girl who is scheming and manipulative -- perfectly willing to sell her body, seduce a man, or murder someone (or four) to get what she wants -- but hardly ever gets it anyway.  The rich girl is painted as a saint, but is probably the most selfish person in the book -- she refuses to be tied down by a man or a child, so she strings her lover along and aborts his child, and then gets jealous when he leaves to make a real life for himself by getting married to somebody else.  The fourth is an all around unbelievable genious who is trained as a carpenter, but is perfectly capable of being a mason, a mechanic, an architect, or whatever else is called for by the increasingly improbable storline.    So without the grand scope, or likable characters, all we're left with is a dirty historical romance so full of explicit sex scenes that if I expurgated this book, I wouldn't have much left to put back on my shelf.    If that's what you're looking for, then go for it.  If no, don't say you weren't warned.
B000WGNLLW|3.0|DD were masters at combining dance beats and loops with real rock instruments. it is a good dance/lounge record but it needs the guitar, bass and drums to make it huge. I know that it will grow on me but DD needs Andy Taylor's imput. This sounds like it was created on computers. It lacks the human touch/ soul.  Dance mongers will love it, rockers will be dissapointed...
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I am embarrassed to admit that I cant stop playing this CD...I offer it to my friends to listen to and they balk at me. Their loss.
B000PTYP84|5.0|Paramore's known for attracting a pretty young crowd, and that's understandable given how young the band itself is.  But I'm a 35 year old guy who's gotten just as hooked on them as any of their teen audience.  This is just some great rock music, with great hooks in almost every song and some amazing musicianship all around.  Hopefully they'll continue to mature and continue to broaden their fan base as they progress.    The MVI DVD was my first Paramore purchase, and it's a great buy.  I have to give special mention to the fact that there are actual mp3's on this disc for you to download to your PC - no DRM involved.  That's gotta be something pretty new for Warner Music (the band is signed to Fueled by Ramen, but Warner apparently handles the distribution), and I hope that they continue doing it and that more labels follow suit.  There are a ton of other great extras on the DVD, including live and promotional videos (the two things I cared about most) as well as other stuff I was less interested in like wallpapers, AIM icons, and screensavers.  It also includes the lyrics to all of the songs on the album, which is a good thing in this case - the printed liner notes are written in a style that's pretty hard to read.    Just to be clear about what this comes with, since I think the Amazon page is a little confusing, this package comes with both a DVD and a regular audio CD that includes the full album plus bonus tracks.  (Amazon shows \\"disc 2\\" above as only including the bonus tracks, which is not the case.  It's the full album.)  In other words, *both discs* have the full album - the only difference is the format.  And of course the DVD has all the extras.    I was worried initially that there was going to be some sort of surreptitious installation of various tracking programs installed when I put this DVD into my computer - you know, like the major labels usually do these days.  I'm still not 100% convinced that isn't the case, but I will say that their terms of use and privacy policies seem adamant that there is nothing of the sort, and it seems that the entire DVD interface is just a Macromedia Flash file - it's like viewing a Flash web site.  You can also just watch it as a standard DVD if you like.  The way their terms of use is worded makes it sound like they know about all the stuff that went on with the Sony rootkit fiasco and they don't want anyone to think that's going to happen with this DVD.  I certainly hope that's the case, as I've now watched it on my PC probably half a dozen times already.    There's really no reason to buy the standard CD over the MVI DVD given all it comes with.  You're really just getting a lot more with this package for only a couple bucks extra.  It's totally worth it.
B000M3ANXY|5.0|Woody Allen begins \\"Annie Hall\\" (named for the title character, played by the inimitable Diane Keaton) with a speech in which he relates to the audience his attitude about romantic relationships (gleaned from either Sigmund Freud or Groucho Marx): \\"I'd never belong to any club that'd have me as a member.\\"  Enter the somewhat giddy Annie, a somewhat sophisticated, somewhat naive transplant from the midwestern hinterlands. Annie and Alvy Singer (Allen's character) soon fall in lust, and the movie explores what happens when the sex and novelty of the relationship wear off.    Alvy soon displays the stock trait of Allen's persona: Neurotic perfectionism. Very set in his ways, he becomes frazzled when Annie (and in flashbacks) the other women in his life venture outside the rigid routines Alvy has set in stone.    Another paradox that manifests itself is Allen's classic disdain for political conservatives (targets of his ire are Eisenhower, William F. Buckley and Commentary magazine). Yet, Alvy is a very *socially* conservative person, who looks down on drug use, rock music and the religious cult fads that characterized the 70s. A great line from the movie is when Jeff Goldblum -- at a pretentious Hollywood party -- calls his guru to get the latest mantra.    Another gem is Christopher Walken's small role as Annie's brother, which will have you howling once Alvy is riding in his car.    Like it's twin, \\"Manhattan,\\" \\"Annie Hall\\" is a love-letter to New York City (not just Manhattan, but to Brooklyn as well, where we visit Alvy's unique childhood home on Coney Island). But, I prefer this one to \\"Manhattan,\\" because of its fresh concept, more screen time for Diane Keaton and Allen's \\"I Hate L.A.\\" scenes.
1402210086|5.0|Though I never read a Georgette Heyer romance I didn't like, \\"Cotillion\\" was the first one that I wanted to immediately start over from the beginning and read all over again. What wonderful characters, what a clever plot, what a delightful (and only slightly predictable) ending. I'd love to read a sequel.
B0009FJ23C|4.0|Since David O. Selznick (producer of \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and \\"Rebecca\\") didn't produce this as a faithful adaptation of the novel, but Henry Blanke (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"Casablanca\\") DID, I recommend seeing the movie first. When you read the novel first, you cast it, design sets and play it out in your mind, and in my mind, Howard Roark is played by Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman is Dominique, and Orson Welles plays a thinly-veiled Charles Foster Kane, aka Gail Wynand. Screenplay by Charles Brackett and Ben Hecht, directed by Howard Hawks, Technicolor, music by Bernard Herrmann.  Anyways, since that's all in my mind's eye, let us deal with what's really there:    This film is the greatest example of post-German expressionism after World War II. Visually, it's overflowing with licht und schatten worthy of Lang and Murnau. This is the movie's greatest achievement, deftly accomplished by cinematographer Robert Burks, who confines Gary Cooper (the movie's martyred saint) in a shadow-world so oppressing, that it rivals Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver\\" and Hitchcock's \\"I Confess\\" (for which Burks was also DP, as he was on all Hitch's films from the early 1950s through Marnie, in 1964, with the exception of \\"Psycho\\") for the sense of loneliness and psychological isolation which crowd in the hero.    Burks owes a lot to \\"Citizen Kane\\" in the use of low-camera-angles employed in projecting the movie's tragic hero, Gail Wynand, played by Raymond Massey. Massey brings a British-Canadian flair to the role that is completely outrageous and incongruous with the role's Hell's Kitchen origins. So what! As with Cary Grant, Massey succeeds in the \\"willing-suspension-of-disbelief\\" department when it comes to ignoring his British accent.    Burks' camera lingers longingly and tenderly on screen siren Patricia Neal, as Dominique. This is when REAL HOT WOMEN got Hollywood roles, and when the likes of Marilyn Monroe \\"replaced\\" Jane Russell and Kim Novak was groomed as the next Rita Hayworth. The scene in which Neal visits Coop's apartment with the none-too-subtle white fur bust ornament above her evening gown is priceless in the glamor department. A few reviewers call this movie \\"dated.\\" If by dated, they mean not having untalented, unalluring and underfed matchsticks like Gwyneth Paltrow and Calista Flockheart, then, yes, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is dated.    Britisher Robert Douglas plays Ellsworth Toohey, the rabble-rousing colmunist with over-the-top and villainous aplomb. Wielding his ever-present cigarette holder with blatant swishiness designed to circumvent the Hayes' office censors, Douglas gives the best flamboyant-homosexual-villian performance this side of Robert Walker, as the tortured Bruno in Hitchcock's \\"Strangers on a Train.\\"    Rounding out this bombastic Expressionist tour-de-force is Max Steiner's equally plush and bombastic Romantic score, which uses heavy brass and low strings to provide an aural sledgehammer that sets the action onscreen to the passionate sturm und drang of Tristan und Isolde. They don't make movie music like this anymore. Composer David Raksin (\\"Laura\\") once quipped that 1940s movie music overwhelmed the listener not only with foreboding, but with \\"fifthboding.\\"    Again, compare Steiner's \\"maximalism\\" (no pun intended) with the oat-bran sparseness of today's so-called composers such as Philip Glass (minimalist is too big a word to describe his simplistic, monotonous, scratchings) and Michael Nyman.    \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a movie made about giants, by giants. Reality be damned, this movie is worthy of \\"Citizen Kane,\\" \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Double Indemnity.\\"    Now, once you've seen the movie, then read the book, which is even better! Do it the other way around, and you'll find yourself \\"what-if\\"ing the Fountainhead that could've been, rather than basking in this sterling example of 1940s cinema.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|This was one of those productions opera fans will be talking about for YEARS!  I WAS THERE, folks and was completely blown away.  This video is the next best thing to being there.  If you enjoy perfect performances, you NEED this video.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|There is nothing like this album or this artist, anywhere. It's honest blunt,jazzy and like another reviewer said... perfection. I haven't  listened to anyone in recent years that has such a talent and it's sad that her personal life will impede her glorious talent from shining through.    Her latest album has more a 60's influence whereas this one has a lot of jazz influence. It's more polite than some of her latest lyrical offerings but razor sharp nonetheless. She remakes \\"Moody's Mood for Love\\" which is done impeccably and in her style. The first two songs are very strong starts and \\"In my Bed\\" is pure genius using a Nas beat as a backdrop. I have to give it to her she knows how to pick her rappers, using Ghostface Killah on Back to Black was the best choice for the Rehab remix.    Anyone with any taste in R&B will love this, its a rare thing to find someone who can sing like Amy.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|This album is a must have in your collection!  It's one of those rare albums you'll listen to daily and each day you'll discover a new beautiful riff, a lovely line (poetry, I dare say)... It's definately one of Mark Knopfler's best solo albums!  I love it! Mark Knopfler's still the best guitarist, musician and lyricist in the world!
B00004VY01|5.0|Note: If you live in the America's you'll need a Multi-Region player to watch this DVD.<br /><br />Released in '97 `Firelight' is a delicate, atmospheric and romantic period film that in my estimation is more than an equal to such well known English classics as `Wuthering Heights' and `Pride and Prejudice.' To compare it with something familiar to movie viewers I would say it has a lot in common with `Jane Eyre' with a little touch of the American tale `The Miracle Worker.'<br /><br />Sophie Marceau is not only beautiful as expected, but delivers a very emotional, controlled performance as the new governess to a wealthy Englishman's child who also happens to be her own daughter. Stephen Dillane also provides a superior performance as the little girls Father and is the perfect choice for Sophie's love interest.<br /><br />`Firelight' has it all; great acting, strong storyline, enchanting soundtrack and lush, sometimes breathtaking cinematography. The sequences filmed of the lake house are magnificent.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I'm not even a country-western fan but I'm here to tell you that this is one for the ages, best my wife and I have ever seen.    I loved reading the 1-star reviews and would like to throw this at them....PAY ATTENTION TO THE CREDITS AND YOU'LL OBSERVE THAT THIS MOVIE WAS CO-PRODUCED BY JOHNNY & JUNE'S OWN SON!!!!!  What better person to have on hand to tell this story.    Anyway...Rent it, buy it, borrow it, or steal it, but in any case make sure you see it....you won't be dissapointed!
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I was really skeptical of this film when I first saw the theatrical preview. I figured my kids would like the film, so I decided to get the DVD. I had to help myself get past the absurdity of a dirty rat that can control the movements of a person by yanking on his hair in order to cook meals to enjoy this film. Once I did, I truly opened the door to a marvelous masterpiece. The film has it's moments of comedy, but the story is really touching. Combining these elements with a wonderful score and marvelous performances makes this my favorite movie of the year.<br /><br />I really hate writing reviews, because I don't want to give too much about the film away. I really knew very little about this movie before I saw it, and I think that helped make it so enjoyable for me when I finally got to see it. One of my most favorite parts of the film is when \\"The Grim Eater\\" writes his review of Gusteau's restaurant near the end of the film. The words are so well organized and seem to just flow in wonderfully succinct passion that I find myself aspiring to elevate my own linguistic skills.<br /><br />I give this DVD 4 stars because of the actual DVD itself. There is no 2-disc version of this film available on DVD that I have been able to find. Whether such a version will be available in the future is unknown. There are only a couple of bonus features. One is the short film \\"Lifted\\" and another is a little presenation on the history of rats. This is really a shame, because I find it rare to desire such a release of most films. Every now and then a film comes along in which I would truly be interested in having lots of bonus material and behind-the-scenes features and information. Ratatouille is one such film and sadly, unless you are willing to buy the Blu-Ray version, it appears we will not have access to those wonderful features.<br /><br />My one caution about the film is don't watch it close to meal time. It always makes me hungry when I watch it!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This film is just amazing. I found that at the end, I was slightly upset that it didn't end in the hollywood fashion, but that is just selfish. It ends perfectly not following the usual horrible basic rubric of high-budget movies. This is a film not a movie.    Normally, I find that when there is no tripod used, that the cameraman better keep still, but in this, I found that it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. This is an amazing film. there are no flowered parts, no \\"that only happens in the movies\\" feel. This is like watching real lives play out. This is how it should be.     Everyone should see this, if not for the film, for the music. I am a sucker for duets, and a sucker for great, original muscianship. They are perfect musically, they synch together just right.     See this film and you will have a new favorite in your list....it's just amazing.
B000NY133G|1.0|Possibly the only real secret here is how Rhonda Byrne again managed to make a fortune out of saying nothing. No one in this video says anything of value rather they allude for 30 minutes to something special going on then, whamo,\\" think it and it will happen\\". Well Im thinking Id wish Rhonda and all the get rich, get thin, get powered, get funky gurus would give all their ill gotten money back to the suckers who bought their stuff.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|His voice is amazing. I'm not talking about his singing ability, I'm talking about his actual voice, its utterly beautiful and heartbreaking. This album is nearly perfect. \\"I really want you\\" is probably my favorite track. The whole album vibe is somewhat on the depressing side, but I love the moodiness of it, and only he could do that because he has the voice for it.  \\"Same Mistake\\" and \\"Carry You Home\\" are also wonderfully sad. I can't wait for him to make his next album. I will definetely buy it.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|\\"Coloured Bedspread\\":  Perhaps the best Eurythmics circa \\"Sweet Dreams\\" song we've never heard.  Listen to those lyrics... stellar hot.  The rest of this CD is touch and go.  \\"Ghosts in My Machine\\" is the star.  Awesome.  Love that piano/squeeze box THANG at the beginning!  So Northern Exposure.  \\"Love Is Blind\\": Reminds me of Eurythmics cira \\"Missionary Man\\".  My GOD, what can't Annie do???  She has been it ALL.  Time for some jazz standards, Hun'!  YOU CAN DOIT!!!

The cookies and tarts and other recipes are well thought out and delicious.  And the pictures are beautiful!
B000W04S6U|5.0|That the Halo series ended with a bang is one thing but the fact that the final installment of the Halo trilogy contains the best music of the three is even more impressive. Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori pull out all the stops in this comprehensive two disc set that contains pretty much all of the music in the game and it's up there among the best soundtracks, film or otherwise, that I've ever heard. They also do away with all of the filler tracks by artists that took away from the Halo 2 soundtrack and keep it down to the bare essentials (there is one unlisted track at the very end of the 2nd disc but it's a harmless rock track and nothing that ruins the integrity of this collection).<br /><br />If you loved the music in the game, this one is a no-brainer but I think this would definitely appeal to anyone who enjoys a good soundtrack either way.
B00005OCMR|3.0|It's been 25 years since Steven Lisberger's TRON opened to mixed reviews in 1982. The question that remains is whether or not TRON was so far ahead of its time that it can legitimately be called a classic today.    Viewing TRON in an historical context one is left feeling that the film is conceptually amazing yet somewhat lacking in both acting and plotting. This is not necessarily a bad thing just a weakness.Many reviewers have disected the plot so no further analysis is really necessary. You can take your choice and view the film either as an adventure film set in the world of computers, a warning against an overly technical society or a Christ type parable.    What remains to be appreciated is the amazing technical skill that went into the film's production. This was a film that harkens back to Disney's Fantasia. It was and is a new type of entertainment never seen before and for that it deserves credit. The film effectively marries traditional animation styles with the newly developed computer animation of companies like MAGI and III into a new form of hybrid and it does this almost seamlessly. The film while slightly dated is still brillient in this aspect.    The disc that I viewed was the 20th Anniversary Edition. The film is presented in widescreen and the transfer while showing its age is well restored. The Wendy Carlos soundtrack sounds fresh and crisp. The sound on the film is a little low but clear. In fact many of the problems are not fromm sound loss but from the jargon filled dialogue.    The heart of this edition is the bonus features. We get just about all available materials from the creation of the film including animation test reels, extensive production drawings, publicity materials , storyboards, trailers and posssibly one of the best making of documentaries seen on a Disney film. The Making of TRON feature runs  88 minutes and features new interviews with most of the people involved and gives a generally good overview of the complex animationissues faced in the making of the film. A commentary track featuring Lisberger, producer Donald Kusner, co producer Harrison Ellenshaw and visual effects supervisor Richard Taylor is well worth the listen even if it does get overly technical at times.    All in all a worthwhile edition to the Disney canon. It is well worth the watch for anyone interested in the history of computer animation.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I just finished watching it. I'm very pleased with the quality.  The video quality is great but what is better is the quality of the  sound on my 5.1 receiver.   It's well worth the price to see the whole series again.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I was happy a few years ago when this longer version of the Grinch saga came out onto the local theatre screen. I liked the book, although the Grinch was not green, and then the cartoon was better since the Grinch could now move and talk, but when I learned Ron Howard was to make a real movie of it I was relieved. And he did not let me down. The Grinch is played by Jim Carrey and does lots of neat Jim Carrey stuff like making faces and talking all funny. He is covered in green fur even over his Area which looks a little weird but is okay. The story in the book wasn't complete enough so now that Dr. Seuss is dead they were able to make it better. I especially liked how there was a scene where you see Who-ville adults attending a party dropping their keys into a bowl as they enter. I liked that movie The Ice Storm and other movies about the swinging '79s and I was glad to see that kind of cultural awareness make it into something I could show my kids again and again, providing a \\"teaching moment\\" to talk about other eras with my little ones. The original cartoon was cute with little Cindy Who and the cartoon dog but until you have seen lots of green fur and Jim Carrey making his faces and Who-ville people who go to key parties and swap Whos (I assume)...well, you haven't seen the Grinch. Kudos to Ron!
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Technically, this is Pixar's best yet. The detail is incredible...from the rain-soaked Parisian streets, to the tiny hairs on Remy. The story is a bit geared towards adults. However, the action keeps the little ones from nodding off. Oh, make sure you have plenty of munchies around while watching the movie.
0743454529|5.0|This so far is the most amazing books I have ever read. In this novel author Jodi Picoult tells the story of a young girl Anna who gets an attorney deciding the she no longer wishes to be a donor for her older sister Kate who has leukemia. After discovering that she has leukemia Kate's parents decide to have a baby that is genetically engineered to be an exact donor match to Kate. Later when Anna is 13 she decides she no longer wants to be the donor for her sister and gets a self absorbed  attorney named Cambell Alexander that brings his dog Judge everywhere he goes saying that its a Disability dog but refuses to tell anyone the truth to why he needs it. After the first court meeting Anna is assigned a Social worker Julia that turns out to have a history with Cambell. Anna also has an older brother that is a rebellious troublemaker who turns out to have a large secret himself.    This truly magnificent story comes with many twists and that will grab the readers attention. Every chapter is told in the eyes of a different character and include numerous flashbacks, tales of a past romance that may not be over, and a shocking ending.This story will pull you in so that you will be unable to put it down. Its truly magnificent.
B00005MP58|4.0|It would still be nice to see a P&P flick that was true to the book, but this does do it more justice than the other versions that I have seen.  Subtitles would have been nice, but if I were to give up all but one copy of this classic, this particular rendition would be the one I would save.  If you haven't read the book, be sure to do so, to experience the nuances not strongly played in the film.  All in all, an excellent film.
B00008CLOA|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! This was the album where Pink Floyd came of age, gaining the commercial breakthrough that had eluded them for years. Before this album they only enjoyed a cult following. With Dark Side of the Moon, they became a household name. This album also marks a complete change in their musical direction; previous albums had little of their signature sound that blossomed here & on later albums.    \\"Money\\" is the best known song on the album, one of the few songs they really ever rocked out on. Other outstanding tunes include: \\"On the Run\\", \\"Time\\" (among the best lyrics Roger Waters ever penned) & \\"Us and Them\\". There's not a single weak moment on this album, There's a reason why this album stayed on the Billboard charts for over ten years; it's just that good!
0800141660|5.0|Emma Thompson's genius shines through, in many ways, in this film.  This is actually the one that got me started on her films, both better and lesser known.  It is perhaps my all-time favorite, for several reasons.  The storyline is candy-like, but has depth; the length of the film isn't burdensome (as Pride and Predudice - A&E version - might be), and it doesn't bore the viewer to watch it numerous times.  I am sad that it isn't entirely true to the book, but this is generally difficult for period pieces, and most of the changes do not seem to injure the spirit of the piece.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! What an incredible piece of music. Alan Parsons project combines the best parts of prog-rock with the best elements of pop. This album has undertones of Pink Floyd, whom Parsons worked with as an engineer on Dark Side of the Moon & elements of pop, where he was influenced by the Beatles, with whom he had worked as an assistant engineer on Abbey Road.    I Robot peaked at #9 on the album charts. There weren't any singles that made it into the Top 200 but that's not an important thing. It was with this album that things began to go right for the Project. It's with this album that certain patterns were established that would continue for the next several albums. The album opens with the incredible instrumental \\"I Robot\\". This song is very similar to Pink Floyd, best song on the album. Then follows \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\", a pop-type song with a good lead guitar solo. Then comes the beautiful ballad \\"Some Other Time\\". \\"Breakdown\\" is from the robot's perspective. Woolfson writes excellent lyrics. \\"Don't Let It Show\\" slows the tempo down & is only an average piece. \\"The Voice\\" is one of the most interesting pieces on the album. It has a distinctive bass line, the instrumental section is very interesting with its strings & subtle sound effects, its tempo change is right on time. \\"Nucleus\\" is an instrumental that pales beside \\"I Robot\\". \\"Day After Day\\" is another average song. \\"Total Eclipse\\" is another instrumental that's not up to \\"I Robot\\", it's an eerie sounding piece that definitely gives the listener the feeling of loss & sacrifice. \\"Genesis Ch. 1 V. 32\\" closes the original album & is another instrumental. This is an excellent song to finish the album, Ian Bairnson once again provides us with a good & appropriate solo. Some may not know the reference of the title. There is NOT a verse 32 in Genesis, chapter one. It's a subtle reference to \\"Man created Robot in his own image\\" which is why the whole thing was doomed to failure.    We've beengiven five bonus cuts  which give a lot of insight into the making of the album. The first is \\"Boules\\" which is the demo version of \\"I Robot\\", it features the clicking of two metal balls (boules is French for balls) that was dropped in the final version. \\"Breakdown\\", \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\" & \\"Day After Day\\" are all early demo versions, interesting in the regard that we can see what the songs 'morphed' from. The last bonus track, \\"The Naked Robot\\", is the most interesting piece. It's an instrumental culled from all the parts of each song from the album. It becomes one of the best tracks on the album. The bonus track \\"The Naked Robot\\" is the most interesting because it uses a menagerie of used & unused portions of songs segueing from one to another to complete a stunning ten minute instrumental. But, beware, it's because man created robot in his own image that doomed them both to failure (\\"Genesis Ch. I V.32\\")    The remastering on this album is excellent & the bonus cuts give an insightful view of the songs in previously unreleased rough demo versions that allows the listener to get an idea of how the songs progressed.
0143038419|5.0|This is a beautiful book, with a touching and evocative story. Gilbert's has such a commanding and light-hearted voice, there's something very strong and feminine about her writing style. This remarkable book describes in a lovely way, a woman finding herself. It's the story of a beautiful woman... and at the same time, the story of us all. I'd recommend this to anyone who's ever gone through heartbreak and questioned the meaning of life.    In this day and age, we Americans live in a society where stress-filled days, long hours, and a mere two-week vacation are the norm in most corporate work environments. We work hard, we play even harder, and often we get burned out in the process. It is no surprise that the dream of dropping everything to take time off to travel and \\"find one's self\\" is one of the most wonderful fantasies to be imagined... and to make us feel like we actually have the ability to \\"escape\\" or outrun our day-to-day woes.
B000IOM1Y6|4.0|Eye in the Sky, their sixth studio album, is probably the Project's second best album exceeded only by I Robot. Eye in the Sky peaked at #7 on the album chart. One single, \\"Psychobabble\\" peaked at #54 on the chart. Another single \\"You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned\\" peaked at #22 on the singles chart. The album opens with the instrumental \\"Sirius\\" which is one of their very best creations. \\"Eye in the Sky\\" really sets the theme of the album; \\"Big Brother is watching you.\\" \\"Children of the Moon\\" is an average song. \\"Gemini\\" slows the tempo but nothing special. \\"Silence and I\\" is the showcase of the album. A beautiful ballad, lead vocal by Eric Woolfson, it has some very meaningful lyrics. The middle section has a rousing arrangement featuring a complete orchestra, one of the Project's most meaningful songs.   \\"We're two of a kind,  \\"Silence and I,  \\"We need a chance to talk things over.  \\"Two of a kind,  \\"Silence and I,  \\"We'll find a way to work it out.\\"  Then a strong horn section closes the song out.\\"You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned\\" is pretty good & certainly the most commercial thing on the album. Good lead by Ian Bairnson. \\"Psychobabble\\" is pretty much what it says, great title but only an average song. \\"Mammagamma\\" is a very good instrumental, typical of the Project, it's candy for the ear. \\"Step by Step\\" follows, it's intriguing but never rises above average. The lovely ballad \\"Old and Wise\\" closes out the original album. The sax solo really helps set it beyond the ordinary.     Six bonus tracks have been added to the original album. The first is a demo version of \\"Sirius\\", it's interesting to hear how the song changed. We get the demo version of \\"Old and Wise\\", vocal done by Woolfson. \\"Any Other Day\\" is an instrumental piece that was later expanded & became \\"You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned\\". Then we get the demo version of \\"Silence and I\\", it just has a guide vocal while the instrumental section hasn't been expanded. The next two pieces are the most intriguing & best bonus tracks. \\"The Naked Eye\\" is a menagerie of used & unused pieces of all the songs that really makes a good overture. The final bonus track is \\"Eye Pieces\\" which are the orchestrated parts that sometimes got buried in the mixes. This is great stuff, it could be titled \\"The Orchestrated Alan Parsons Project\\". Oh yeah, the remastering is excellent.
0440238609|4.0|This series has been ridiculed by the ridiculous right, lauded by the loony left and, as usual, ignored by the lukewarm middle. These books are well written, have a strong moral and ethical message, and encourage free thought. And let us not also forget, they are a work of pure FANTASY! Whether or not the author had some hidden agenda is not important. The fact that the trilogy relates a fun and original story is what is important. Not suppositions based on the authors faith or lack there of.<br /><br />The guy is no Lewis, Jordan, Salvatore, or Tolkien, but its a good series. Have fun reading it!
0316166685|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It provides a realistic view of grief instead of a sugar coated version that many of us like to read, myself included.  I only see movies with happy endings :), so I typically wouldn't read a book such as this one, but I couldn't put it down.  Yes, I did cry and cry and cry at the beginning of the book and many times throughout.  As others have stated, the book doesn't tie up into a neat little bow at the end which I think is a more accurate portrayal of real life, even if it leaves your heart aching at the end.  I could do without the \\"supernatural\\" part of the book, but I can overlook that given the beauty of the rest of the book.  It is NOT a book for all ages (I'd say not for under 16).  I read the book a couple of years ago and one of the lines stuck with me so much that I've kept it written down ever since.  The parents are having a hard time comforting each other after the death of their daughter because \\"before they had never been broken together.\\"  I may not have that quoted exactly right as I don't have it in front of me, but that's the idea.  It's so poignant to me and something I had never thought about - the idea that in a relationship one person usually comforts the other, but in a situation like this where they share the same grief, neither is able to provide comfort to the other.  That's powerful.  This book is not a \\"fun\\" read, but it's a must read.
B001041JLE|2.0|The 2 Stars are not for the album,(I Love Thriller), they're for the LAME bonus disc. I just see this release as a huge wasted chance to finally release the rest of the great unreleased tracks from the Thriller sessions. What happened to songs like &#34;Hot Street&#34;, &#34;Trouble&#34; and &#34;NightLine&#34;. Those songs are excellent and are a worthy addition to a Thriller 25th year collection. I couldn't care less about a bunch of remixes. I never listen to them.  The Black Eyed Peas don't belong on a release of Thriller. Michael could've and should've done much better.
B000002L68|4.0|We love this CD. The music from the movie Purple Rain is very good and a must-have for any fan of Prince.
0140120416|5.0|I had decided that I wanted to learn Russian on my own. I started initially by attempting to learn from one or two Internet sites. I grew frustrated very quickly with these, as the concepts weren't very well explained. After reading a number of reviews on Amazon.com about various Russian instruction books, I decided that this one was the one I would buy.    I was not at all disappointed in the quality of the instruction in this book. I was able to learn quickly, as everything was explained extremely well -- not in some vague and hard-to-understand terms as some of the earlier lessons I had seen.    Let me break here for a moment to put in a comment about the Russian language: this is not an easy language to learn. I am not trying to offend anyone by saying this. However, I am a life-long learner of foreign languages. I am already proficient in German, French and Spanish, and I have (so I have been told) a high IQ.    Yet, the Russian language was hard for me to learn. It has six noun cases, and verb tenses are handled quite differently than in English. It is, therefore, even more remarkable that Brown manages to take something that difficult, and organize it into building blocks in the way that he has done. But, on the flipside, if you have absolutely no experience with foreign languages, I would not recommend starting with Russian as a first foreign language.    All that aside, the book is excellent in teaching a person to read and write Russian, from the perspective of knowing nothing to start with, and progressing to reading a Chekhov short story at the end of the book.    As with any foreign language, the book is only a foundation, and it is up to the reader to constantly improve his or her command of the language by doing extensive reading, looking up new vocabulary words (sometimes for the tenth time, before one actually remembers the word) and exposing oneself to various topics in the new language.    Now that I have told you about the book's good points, letme tell you about the major drawback. The big deficit this book has -- and it is a major one, no matter how well it is written -- is that it falls very far short in the pronunciation department. Yes, it does have the usual English simulations, using phonetics, after many of the words (which slacks off as the lessons progress). But there is a HUGE difference between reading about pronunciation and imagining how you THINK it might sound, and actually hearing it spoken by native Russian speakers.    I am even afraid that if I progress too far without some instruction in the CORRECT pronunciation, I may develop some bad habits, even if they are mostly only pronunciations in my head.    I have searched high and low for a GOOD beginning Russian audio. I purchased one that only sounds out miscellaneous words, and was not satisfied with it. I have tried podcasts, in which I have found the speaking waaaay too fast for an absolute beginner. And I have seriously considered buying the Rosetta Stone CDs (said to be the best), but have been a bit put off by the price.    What would be absolutely ideal would be a companion audio CD to go along with this book. (Publisher, are you listening?) I could almost guarantee that it would be a big seller. If there were pronunciation going along with the actual lessons, spoken by native Russians, this book would be unbeatable!    One last thing -- just a small annoyance really. My book started to fall apart (pages coming out at the binding on the lower part of the book) as I was only in the first or second chapter. Although I was able to do a homemade repair job that worked quite well, the quality of the instruction contained in the book deserves a better quality binding job.

1400095204|5.0|I was very happy to have read this book. I learned about what was going on in Nigeria during the 60s. Huge pluses for me was the fact that I was so in touch with the characters of the book. I was also emotionally invested. This is a book that I will never forget!
B000H30B2C|5.0|Merian Cooper directed the original 1933 King Kong, and if he were alive to see Peter Jackson's version, I guarantee he'd say:<br /><br />\\"Boy do I wish we could have done it this way.\\"<br /><br />Interestingly tho, the idea of Ann Darrow eventually warming to and becoming attached to Kong seems to be a creation of the 1976 version. I've watched the original many times, and although there is an obvious obsession in Kong for Ann Darrow, it appears to be one way. Everyone in the original seems to pretty much regard Kong as a monster to be feared, battled, or exploited. In the 30s, and long afterward, sentiment towards the preservation of irreplaceable creatures had not developed much, if at all.<br /><br />In Jackson's version, I highly enjoyed the relaxed intro in New York. I was dazzled by every sequence on the island, and felt the full effect of the emotional hammer he brought down on us for the ending sequences.<br /><br />This movie is absolutely true to the spirit of the original, showing an unusual reverence in a remake for its predecessor. If you liked the original Kong, and especially if you first saw it as a child, you will love this one.<br /><br />There is no need to over analyze this movie. It was not made for depth of art, although that is not ignored in the film. It was made as a flat out \\"watch me and enjoy\\", with a bit of \\"try to keep your jaw up\\" thrown in.<br /><br />Just as an afterthought, to dispute a few other posts I have read, Jack Black was great in this film, and COMPLETELY on top of his role. Although the character itself is undeniably shallow, Black's depth of performance is far superior to either Robert Armstrong in the original, or Charles Grodin's in the '76 release.<br /><br />I now own both the extended DVD and the blu ray releases of this film. Both are excellent presentations for their format in regard to both video and audio quality.

B000WQ9UA8|1.0|I didn't think this was her greatest album.  I was disappointed becuase she only co-wrote 2 of the tracks.
6304184832|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie from the start and there are very few movies I will watch more than once. This is one I will and have atleast 3 times. I felt the plot was good the characters were very believeable. The movie was able to keep my interest to the very end and most don't. Some of my other favorites are Men in Black, Independence Day, The Mask, Grease, Dirty Dancing to name a few. I hope this helps I really liked this movie.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I think it is not necessary to write something about the movie, if you love Pixar movies, this is no different. What makes this Blu Ray so special? The picture quality! I have never seen such a beautiful image on a Blu Ray. Full digital transfer from the master is the key for this. The details are just stunning. You can test this, if you own the DVD release. The Full HD picture adds so much more to the movie, you can see all the details on the cars, and the colors are so bright and vivid, like a perfect drawing. If you want to show what Blu Ray is really capable, look no further this is it, top notch all the way. I would give 6 out of 5 stars for the picture quality
B0002EXH5O|5.0|If anything, you should get this cd BECAUSE of \\"Holy Wars-Punishment is Due and Rust in Piece\\". Holy Wars is a BLISTERING opening track that is brutal as it is intelligent.

We know the history of Mustaine & Elfson. Friedman & Menza are the SECOND best line-up for the 'deth (Poland and GAR RULE!). Swift and on point drumming by Menza who kept the music flowing PERFECTLY!

B000UBMWG4|5.0|As Originally printed in Hi Def Digest in August:    Responding to persistent questions from early adopters on both sides of the aisle, Warner has provided further details on the exact configuration of its upcoming high-def 'Blade Runner' releases.    As officially announced late last month, Warner Home Entertainment will at last be debuting the definitive 'Blade Runner' in two editions apiece on Blu-ray and HD DVD. Set to street on December 18 are 'Blade Runner: The Complete Collector's Edition' and the even more elaborately-packaged 'Blade Runner: The Ultimate Collector's Edition,' each a five-disc set boasting several different versions of the film and hours of newly-produced bonus content.      Since that announcement, speculation has run rampant over just how much of the material on these mammoth sets would be presented in full high-definition. (Warner famously released the HD DVD edition of 'The Ultimate Matrix Collection' last May with the final two discs presented in standard-def, a fact that wasn't revealed until just days before that disc's release.)    This time around, the studio apparently going the full disclosure route, revealing to Bill Hunt at The Digital Bits that while all five versions of the film included on the next-gen releases are being mastered in actual 1080p video, all of supplementary materials (including the new documentary \\"Dangerous Days,\\" and the deleted scenes) will be presented in 480p standard definition only.     According to Hunt, Warner says the reason for this has nothing to do with disc space on either format, but rather the compressed time schedule in which the various extras are being produced.    Warner has set a $39.95 list price for the five-disc 'Complete Collector's Edition' of 'Blade Runner,' while the deluxe 'Ultimate Collector's Edition' (featuring the same disc configurations but with special \\"Deckard Briefcase\\" packaging and other collectibles) will list for $99.95.    We've added these latest details to our disc details pages for each of the four next-gen editions of 'Blade Runner', which you'll linked from our Blu-ray Release Schedule and our HD DVD Release Schedule, under December 18.     You can also discuss the various editions of 'Blade Runner' in our Forums area -- click the following links to visit our dedicated threads for the 'Blade Runner' Blu-ray releases or the 'Blade Runner' HD DVD releases.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|Picking up after the events of \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" in which unknown forces caused the bodies of the recently deceased to return to life in search of live, human prey, \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" instantly slams us into a world crumbling in confusion, panic, and desperate violence. As people break their ties and scatter to survive, one band of four, a helicopter pilot, his pregnant girlfriend, and two swat team members, take refuge in a shopping mall surrounded by the flesh-eating dead. Perhaps they can take control of the already infested mall, but what then?<br /><br />In 1968, George A. Romero shocked the world with his apocalyptic vision, \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\" The black and white, low-budget film became a phenomenon that spawned remakes, countless copycats, and 3 excellent sequels, the first of which came eleven years later. That first sequel was \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" and it would seem that most zombie fans consider it to be the best film of its kind. Loaded with satire and comic-book violence, some, Romero himself for example, do not even consider it a true \\"horror\\" film. Its extreme action and over-the-top look and style make it far more fun than scary to many, but I'd count myself among those who feel that there are definitely some genuinely horrific moments and themes throughout. But, whether you're watching it for fun or fright, this is a movie that is more than it seems, and the original \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" definitely deserves a place among the greatest films ever made. If you're a zombie fan, you know this is a must own. If you're not, and especially if you haven't even experienced the genre, make sure you give this one a look before committing yourself against it. Be prepared for some wild and gory stuff, yes, but try to look beyond it as well.<br /><br />Dawn was followed in 1985 by a sequel that is good as part of the series, but far less enjoyable (in my opinion), \\"Day of the Dead.\\" Day was followed by the most recent sequel, \\"Land of the Dead,\\" in 2005. Land was an excellent installment in the series. One year before that, a remake of Dawn was released without the involvement of Romero. It's an excellent film in its own right, but definitely tailored to modern sensibilities. All action and very little substance, and I'm not a fan of its fast-moving, purely disease-infected zombies. With the new wave of zombie and zombie-like films that have been coming out recently, the original \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" has yet to be topped. Though, I have to give special points to \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\" It comes highly recommended as well.<br /><br />There is truly no better way to own \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" than in the 4-disc \\"Ultimate Edition\\" from Anchor Bay. You get three beautiful, widescreen versions of the film, each on its own disc with a different commentary track and extras, and a disc full of documentaries as well. Disc One is Romero's true cut, the U.S. Theatrical version, along with a great commentary by Director George Romero, the legendary make-up/effects man Tom Savini, and Assistant Director Chris Romero (George's wife). Also on Disc One are TV Spots and Theatrical Trailers, Radio Spots, a Poster and Advertising Gallery, a George Romero bio, and a comic book preview. Disc Two offers up the Extended Version. This is coupled with an audio commentary by Producer Richard P. Rubinstein. Most interesting is the very dated Monroeville Mall commercial which is also included along with a Behind-the-Scenes photo gallery, a memorabilia gallery, and production stills. Disc Three presents the European Version of the film. This is a more straightforward horror cut of the film from the hands of Dario Argento. Disc Three also includes one of those always fun cast commentaries, and we are lucky enough to get all four of the brilliant lead actors together here for this one! We also get a Dario Argento bio, a home video and soundtrack art gallery, an international poster and advertising gallery, an international pressbook gallery, U.K. TVSpots, international theatrical trailers, and an international lobby card gallery. Disc Four is where the documentaries are at, and here we are treated to: The Dead Will Walk, a great new documentary including interviews with just about everyone you'd hope to hear from; Roy Frumkes' Documentary of the Dead, a fascinating documentary actually filmed during the making of the film; On-Set Home Movies from a most appreciated zombie extra, Robert Langer; And a great tour of the Monroeville Mall with one of the stars, Ken Foree. There's also a bizarre little Easter Egg on the disc. At least, I think it was on Disc Four. After watching so much material on 4 different discs, it can be hard to keep track!<br /><br />The DVD set comes in sturdy, fold-open cardboard packaging with a slip case, DVD guide with mall map, and a neat little comic book teaser that illustrates the first part of the film (ending right when they arrive at the mall). It's a fantastic collection and a must own for any true fan!eatrical trailers, and an international lobby card gallery.

B000M9BPEY|3.0|I read a review on another website that the picture quality on this disc was top notch. Aside from this being a great movie, the picture quality on my set didn't look much better than an upconverted SD DVD. If you're expecting really good PQ be cautious before buying.
B000UR9T7I|3.0|After hearing and reading several reviews I was quite skeptical about this film.  After watching it, they actually helped me in being a bit more lenient on it and thus the three star rating.    On the positive side are the special effects that are stunning (even more so on blu-ray) and the plot has some interesting twists that could have made the movie better than the two first ones.  For example the dark side of spiderman or the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend as they follow different paths in their careers.    Alas that did not happen.  The plot remains swallow compared to what could have been.  Moreover the three villains are not well developed- especially Venom who could have been a great asset to the movie.  He has way to small part in a movie that evolves around super heroes and villains.  Sandman is a bit more developed and he could return if there is a Spiderman 4.    All in all the movie is not that bad considering the special effects and costumes that are amazing.  Too bad that the plot did not explode to what it should have been.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|This is from Hi-Def Digest printed in August:    Responding to persistent questions from early adopters on both sides of the aisle, Warner has provided further details on the exact configuration of its upcoming high-def 'Blade Runner' releases.    As officially announced late last month, Warner Home Entertainment will at last be debuting the definitive 'Blade Runner' in two editions apiece on Blu-ray and HD DVD. Set to street on December 18 are 'Blade Runner: The Complete Collector's Edition' and the even more elaborately-packaged 'Blade Runner: The Ultimate Collector's Edition,' each a five-disc set boasting several different versions of the film and hours of newly-produced bonus content.     Since that announcement, speculation has run rampant over just how much of the material on these mammoth sets would be presented in full high-definition. (Warner famously released the HD DVD edition of 'The Ultimate Matrix Collection' last May with the final two discs presented in standard-def, a fact that wasn't revealed until just days before that disc's release.)    This time around, the studio apparently going the full disclosure route, revealing to Bill Hunt at The Digital Bits that while all five versions of the film included on the next-gen releases are being mastered in actual 1080p video, all of supplementary materials (including the new documentary \\"Dangerous Days,\\" and the deleted scenes) will be presented in 480p standard definition only.     According to Hunt, Warner says the reason for this has nothing to do with disc space on either format, but rather the compressed time schedule in which the various extras are being produced.    Warner has set a $39.95 list price for the five-disc 'Complete Collector's Edition' of 'Blade Runner,' while the deluxe 'Ultimate Collector's Edition' (featuring the same disc configurations but with special \\"Deckard Briefcase\\" packaging and other collectibles) will list for $99.95.    We've added these latest details to our disc details pages for each of the four next-gen editions of 'Blade Runner', which you'll linked from our Blu-ray Release Schedule and our HD DVD Release Schedule, under December 18.     You can also discuss the various editions of 'Blade Runner' in our Forums area -- click the following links to visit our dedicated threads for the 'Blade Runner' Blu-ray releases or the 'Blade Runner' HD DVD releases.
B000UX6THK|3.0|As others have pointed out, the picture and sound of the video is excellent here, so I don't wish to complain about that. I've only watched the DVDs as far as disc 3, but I'm pleased with what I've viewed. I have yet to look at the extras on the last disc.The packaging leaves a lot to be desired (it's pretty bare-bones, no booklet or liner notes). The DVD 'authoring' however seems pretty shoddy (just looking at the printing on the discs, and the flimsy box they come in, one can see they tried to keep manufacturing costs to a minimum). The DVDs are manufactured in Mexico, for what that's worth.<br /><br />The problem is this. On discs 4 and 6, the title menu on which you are directed to play individual episodes (there are three or four episodes on each disc) DOES NOT WORK. Consequently, the only way to watch a single episode of your choosing on either of these discs is to select the menu which says \\"Play All Episodes\\" and then click forward through the chapters until you reach the one you want. This isn't a huge issue, but it is nonetheless inconvenient. Having paid about $90 for my purchase (from a local merchant, since I like to support local retailers occasionally, buying about half my music and video and print media in stores and the other half online where it is usually cheaper), I feel entitled to a copy free of defects.
B001041JLE|5.0|Someohters can say that's a wasted chance... but I believe this is just an &#34;update&#34; for the album. If people today likes Black Eyed Peas, Kanye West... well, seems that Michael looked around and made a change.He's an artist, he can sculpture him own work. If you don't like, buy the Special Edition released on 2001.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|Having watched 50 years of versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\", I believe that Michael Caine is the best Scrooge ever, topping even Finney. The muppet casting is perfect for the original characters of the story. The humor is satisfying (even the fifth time around) and the direction is well done so it has become a classic that I pull out each Christmas. Hence the four stars (which should be five to this point).    What's the Disappointment? Although I have the 2002 version, I bought this one for the \\"widescreen\\" and hoping it would be digitally remastered. What a disappointment! I think what they must have done to get the 'widescreen' effect was go in closer on the Pan-and-Scan because you have the tops of 'people's' heads hitting the top of the screen. Some scenes seem remastered, others not.     Cutting the song, \\"When Love is Gone\\", is jarring. I am not a fan of the song but Michael Caine's grief at what he has lost is the turning point in the movie for Scrooge, as Caine himself says in the 2002 interview which is not on this DVD revision (why not?). You have lost the whole point of the story if you cut this scene. I could not believe it!!!    Walt Disney understood family and children in a way that his successors do not. Jim Henson understood the value of all the emotions and the necessity of humor as few others have. Neither of them would have cut that scene. Artistically, I cannot believe that Brian Henson would have wanted it cut and I cannot believe that the Disney studios of today care two hoots about children (the shoddy productions of the Disney Channel are enough of an argument, I think.) Therefore, my recommendation is buy the 2002 version until Disney wakes up and does the justice to this film that it deserves.
1582701709|4.0|What I liked most about \\"The Secret\\" was all the quotes from some authors I like, such as Neale Donald Walsch, John Assaraf, Jack Canfield, Bob Proctor, & Mike Dooley, to name a few.<br /><br />For instance, Neale notes, \\"So your purpose is what you say it is.  You mission is the mission you give yourself.  Your life will be what you create it as...\\"<br /><br />And Jack Canfield says, \\"Our job is not to figure out the how.  The how will show up out of a commitment and belief in the what.\\"<br /><br />The only problem I had is that the book read more like sound bites than a cohesive story.  To really understand the philosophy of the people quoted, you have to read their books.<br /><br />The \\"Secret Summaries\\" at the end of each chapter were good and I liked the book, but I have to admit, I liked \\"What the Bleep\\" (the movie and book) a little more than I liked \\"The Secret\\", because of the way the quotes were more seamlessly inserted into the overall story.
B000G75994|5.0|Since,  the last four decades, (since Clara Haskil's death in 1961) and leaving aside the presence of Lili Kraus and Ingrid Haebler, I must confess and regret besides, the absence of a female pianist so admirably devoted and committed with the genuine Mozartian spirit, until Joao Maria Pires made her appearance.<br /><br />She not only possesses a nice sound, she really makes the journey toward the nucleus of the score and illuminates us around  those unsaid but visible details that really are the final outcome of an intense search.<br /><br />That's is the main reason that has made me to admire her so much. So, don't miss this album.
B000ROALE4|4.0|I have the \\"original\\" not the reissue CD. I like the original cover art better than the hand picture. But I didn't get the second disc with the video and extra tracks which would be cool. Christ Illusion is a really good Slayer album. Fast, thrash, and scary. Killer riffs and classic Hanneman-King guitar solos. Tom's vocals are right on. Dave Lombardo AGAIN proves he is, without question, the best thrash/metal drummer in the world. I hate to say it's \\"their best album since\\" whatever, because all Slayer albums sound \\"like Slayer\\" to me - they are all heavy fast and super thrashy great. Christ Illusion starts off with an awesome track, Flesh Storm. At first I wasn't keen on the \\"single,\\" Eyes of the Insane but it has grown on me big time. The two tracks I don't really like are \\"Skeleton Christ\\" and \\"Cult,\\" both by Kerry King, who I think has really gone downhill in his writing since the Seasons era. Kerry's lyrics are very immature and often just plain stupid. For example, in \\"Cult\\" he is ultra-against religion, but then claims worshiping Satan is the way to go. Well, worshiping Satan, that is also a religion. To me stating \\"all religions are bad\\" and then saying \\"but I follow this religion\\" is lame. I like the lyrics about war, violence, insanity, social issues, and free thinking, but King's lyrics against Christianity aren't making sense anymore. Kerry should let Tom and Jeff write the lyrics. King's guitar riffs, solos, and overall music are still on par with the rest of the Slayer catalog, no problems there. The album ends with \\"Supremist,\\" which as Slayer tends to do, closes the album with the kind of musical furry only Slayer can produce. Great closing track.    Christ Illusion gets 8 out of 10 stars from me, because I love 8 of the 10 songs. Standout tracks: Flesh Storm, Jihad, Supremist
B000MGUZM0|4.0|This record is 87% good. It is a B+ in my book. Yes, \\"Funeral\\" was an A. Yes, this is a sophomore LP. No, it is not bad. It is just different.    To be honest, I did not even appreciate most of the record until I saw them play it live. Why? It is not as instantly attention grabbing. A lot more subtle than \\"Funeral\\".     It can get a little preachy at times (\\"Windowsill\\"). And genrally tends to illustrate less of a lyrical narrative in each song than \\"Funeral\\" did. I will say this though, I feel the music here is more compelling as a method of narration than it was on \\"Funeral\\".     Some people fault them for putting out an album not as good as \\"Funeral\\", but I feel that is more a product of people's expectations based on their first record rather than a reaction to this record. If this were not the Arcade Fire, how would people feel about it?     This is why I stand true to a B+. \\"No Cars Go\\", \\"Lighthouse\\", \\"Neon Bible\\" - all great. \\"Windowsill\\", not so much. \\"Black Mirror\\" is good and most of the rest of the record is good. Not legendary. But good.      Also, the art for it is great, particularly in the special edition (though I'm still slightly baffled as to why labels now put out special edition versions of records without bonus tracks or anything...).
B000I2JKEC|1.0|Amazon, please post my review. Also please only post HD Reviews and not standard disc reviews.
1577314808|5.0|This is a powerful book on how to let go of our ego and, in so doing, transform our lives.  Eckhart Tolle explains that to achieve enlightenment, one must learn to disidentify with the mind.  By that, he is not saying that we shouldn't think, but that we should realize that we are not our thoughts.  He notes that in the enlightened state, you still use your thinking mind, but in a much more focused and effective way.  You use it for practical purposes, but are free of the involuntary internal dialogue, and therefore you achieve inner stillness.<br /><br />An important message of the book is that when you surrender to what is and become fully present, the past ceases to have any power over you.  And the now is all that matters.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book with the power to change your life, this is a great book to read!
037582913X|5.0|Much to my parent's dismay, I spent hours and hours having them re-read this story to me. To their credit, they did it without a fuss- or without missing a beat on giving Grover an appropriate voice, yelling and screaming \\"YOU TURNED THE PAGE!!!\\" It's definitely one of the things that helped me learn how fun reading could be, and what has made me love reading so much today.    Now, I've got a beautiful little girl of my own, and I only hope she enjoys it as much as I.
0143038419|5.0|This book meant so much to me. Elizabeth's spiritual journey of true life began with realizing she was not really living. This is an experience that calls out to every human being, most of us just don't listen. Growing up, I knew there had to be more to life than just getting married, having a good job and living in a nice house. There had to be something more, something deeper.    We all have an inner life that is trying desperately to break through our noisy minds and listen to it. Elizabeth says there is so much noise. She took the time to listen to her real self speaking to her.    My inner journey began 25 years ago, with an author by the name of Vernon Howard of the New Life Foundation. He teaches all these principles that Elizabeth talks about in the book. They are not far fetched ideas on how to be happy, but on the contrary, right inside our own souls. My heart sang when I read Eat, Pray, Love. I was hearing these beautiful principles in her book that I have been studying myself for so many years. The emotion was overwhelming.     Her ideas of saying no and that thoughts aren't really us are very profound principles that we all can use every day in every situation. It was nice to hear them talked about in the simple and wonderful way she has of expressing herself.    I bought this book for all the women in my family and would suggest it for anyone. It is an incredible book.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|A lot of the reviews underneath have covered much of what I want to say about this release. Apart from that there are some quality songs here that could easily have had a life outside of this context, its more important to praise the albums role. As the actors have roles, so does the music. It tells the story of the main character, from the perspective of the great songwriter in Eddie Vedder.     You can say what you want about Chris. Eddie opted to follow and write about the adventurous side of him. His desire to search for new meanings and his ability to stay unattached to material things. He was in many was a free spririt, something Mr. Vedder has drawn inspiration from. This inspiration feels real and that is the main reason why this album works so well.     The best songs on the album are No Ceiling and Guaranteed. No Ceiling works as a short but very effective song in the begnning of the album. I wish it was longer, but unfortuantly, it ends on 1:33 and leaves a strong desire for more. The last song, guaranteed is the crown of the album, both lyrically and musically. First time I read through the lyrics, I was feeling Chris more than I ever did while reading the book.     Great soundtrack, great songwriter and great movie. Full score!
0743486285|5.0|I loved this book! I read it in a matter of days; I couldn't put it down. In 1987 I was 13 years old and saw Crüe on the Girls tour in Rochester, NY (where Vince's mustard jar incident occurred).     Nikki has written an extremely honest and exceptionally personal account of his darkest experiences in a way that makes you feel connected with him. My heart was sad for him, I laughed with him, and, in the end, I am happy for him. I have loved Nikki Sixx since the mid `80s and I now have new admiration for him. To see Nikki so raw and destroyed and then able to fight the courageous battle against it all and come out on top is truly inspirational. Thankfully, he and his amazing talents are still with us.     This is a great book and I recommend it highly to everyone, but especially to anyone who is struggling in their own dark places. I believe it will offer insight and strength to many! Thank you, Nikki!!     (PS: The soundtrack is awesome too!! Nikki rocks!!!)
B000E1MTY0|5.0|if you dont own this movie on HD DVD you must see it. Even if you have the DVD version spend the money and upgrade. this movie is not only a great movie but it looks stunning in HD. top 5 movie currently out in HD easily.    For HD DVD I would say the movies you have to own are (in no order): Batman Begins, TMNT, King Kong, Serenity, Shrek
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I watched this series in the US when it debuted in April 2007 on Discovery's High Definition Theater in amazing 1080i! Now I get to watch it in 1080p!! The narrator for the series televised here in the US was Sigourney Weaver, and she did a wonderful job! No matter who narrates this gem of a series on whichever edition that's released, it is the best capture of God's majestic beauty of our magnificent planet ever to be filmed! The scenes throughout this series were so stunning that my eyes flooded and my jaws dropped open as if I were there myself experiencing these great wonders of our tiny place in our little corner of the universe myself. I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone, whether you're a nature lover or not. You cannot be disappointed with adding this series to your video library. Also, in our time of new technical advancements, you MUST watch this series in true 1080p HD if you want to experience this fantastic journey in and around our world instead of just watching it!
B00006IUL7|4.0|\\"Insomnia\\" is a 2002 film that explores the inner workings of a top detective (Al Pacino as Wll Dormer) as he nears the end of a brillant career as a police investigator, who is so feed up with the obviously guilty going free that he's starting to compromise his vaulted integrity to make sure justice is done.<br /><br />The wild beauty of the Alaskian landscape should have gotten second-billing behind Pacino, as it plays an intregral in several parts of the movie.  As it is, Hilary Swank, Robin Williams and Paul Dooley are memorable in their roles as an eager police detective, a murder suspect, and the crusty local police chief, respectively.<br /><br />How does it all mesh?  Well, indeed, as an increasingly tired Dormer (played well, as usual, by Pacino) careens from mistake to coverup, until he has a change of heart, salvaging his career along the way.<br /><br />However, Amazon lists this as an 'essential video'.  It's a good movie, but it's not in the league of, say, Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, The Seven Samuri, and so on.<br /><br />I'd rate this a four-star film.  Recommended, primarily of Pacino's usual excellent acting.  Williams is also notable for his low-keyed, everyman, but chilly, role.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Forty years on, Grand Prix is still the best motor racing film ever made. The cars may be faster now, filming techniques improved and special effects more advanced, yet the film still has a truly epic scale and a feeling of veracity down to the last gear change that would be impossible to duplicate today. It feels real because much of it is real, the actors (with the exception of Brian Bedford) doing much of the driving themselves, with the production even entering cars in real races to seamlessly match footage. The real danger is only underlined by the fact that so many of the professional drivers in the film died racing themselves (ten in the decade following the filming alone). The crashes are there, along with the knowledge that that's what many in the crowd come for, but more than that, each race has a different character: more than just a different look, they're almost tone poems at times, one race from the driver's seat, another from a spectator's, another almost inside a character's head. Yet throughout, unlike later films, you always have a clear idea of what is going on and what point the race scenes are trying to make. The sequences have clearly been thought through and designed both emotionally as well as visually, with the great use of long lenses to establish scale and speed as cars drift in and out of focus giving the film a feel at once realistic and almost dreamlike (an impression further heightened in Saul Bass' almost balletic split-screen sequence). It's still a remarkably good looking film, too, not least because it was made at a time when the cars still looked like bullets rather than vacuum cleaners.     The plot itself may be simply a globe-trotting star-studded soap opera at heart - the roadshow equivalent of a doorstop bestseller - but it's a more than serviceable framework to hang the racing scenes on: after a spectacular crash in the Monte Carlo Grand Prix that cripples team mate Brian Bedford, James Garner's Formula One tries to work hisway back on the circuit by racing for Toshiro Mifune's fledgling team while having an affair with Bedford's wife Jessica Walter. But while top-billed Garner may be the nominal and not particularly sympathetic lead, it's Yves Montand's ageing champion gradually realizing the absurdity of what he does but unable to quit who makes the greatest impression: so much so that when Garner disappears for much of the last third of the movie you barely miss him. Yet the cars remain the real stars, thanks to John Frankenheimer's constantly imaginative direction and his obvious enthusiasm for the material without ever losing himself in the minutiae as Steve McQueen did with Le Mans.     The film used every 65mm SuperPanavision camera then in existence, and thankfully the widescreen DVD transfer is a considerable improvement over the TV prints. Although it hasn't restored Mifune's voice, which was reportedly in the version shown at the film's premiere but subsequently replaced by Paul Frees on all prints (Adolfo Celi is also very obviously dubbed, possibly by Maximilian Schell), it does boast a good array of featurettes covering the making of the film and the Overture and Entr'acte from Maurice Jarre's excellent score have been retained.
B000QUEQBI|5.0|this is a great movie and it looks very good on HD DVD  I recommend getting this film on HD DVD!
0374105235|5.0|This is the most gripping book I have ever read.  I could not put it down. When I had fininshed the last chapter, I was not done reading. I wanted to know more. I wanted to know how dear Ishmael stasrted to heal as he moved permanently to the US.  Maybe when he has the experience more removed from himself, he could write a follow-up book about how he as a child soldier processed those years of trauma.My heart goes out to him in love and admiration for what has has gone thru and congquered!!  Where is the movie?? Is Hollywood going to make a movie of this book? The world need to see what is really going on with these dear children!!
0974869449|5.0|Before buying those flashcards I made an extensive research on the market and these proved to be the best choice. They provide plenty of useful information in a clear and organised manner, and are very nice to use. I feel they are helping me very much in my progress. I will surely buy the second volume as well!
B00006LLNU|5.0|This is one of my most favorite albums of all time.To those who are saying that it's not innovative,well it is and it isn't;what truly IS innovative these days? most everything's been done by now from steve roach to gg allin.it's hard to do.the sad thing is that this album seems to have gotten so much publicity from all the wrong places--this isn't the type of music anyone can just dive into because gweneth paltro or whoever else in hollywood or otherwise likes it.this is music that requires the listener to take the time to sit down and experience it from an asthetic viewpoint:it's not fast-food pop music.if you have a receptive attitude towards it you'll probably like it.<br /><br />compared to ros' other albums () is a head above the rest because it has a perfect continuity from start to finish,like classic albums from the past had such as dark side of the moon,relayer,harvest,etc.the other ros albums are too jarring in transitions from song-to-song in my opinion,and that takes away from the experience of going to another mindset.<br /><br />i can't wait for the day sigur ros make a 60+minute,one track/one song opus...it's bound to happen!
0393061310|4.0|The book consolidated some not-so-new ideas and presented in an entertaining and refreshing style. It is disappointing that it lacks proper attributions in many places. The book also gets a bit repetitive and boring after a while. The key ideas should be able to be delivered in half of the current length.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I saw clips of Planet Earth with the Sigourney Weaver narration and it made me cringe.  Get the original BBC version with David Attenborough, like I did (thanks to the previous reviewers who made me aware of this).  Attenborough has made a living narrating for nature shows and is The All-time Master.  Weaver is what?  An exterminator of aliens?  Yeah, no thanks.
B000GFLE86|3.0|I can totally understand why many people like this artist.  She has a fine voice (which sometimes DOES sound much like Billie Holiday).  On this particular cd, I do not like some of the song selections (The Summer Wind for one), or some of the light-weightedness of the arrangements (why put the riff for Jingle Bells into Joni Mitchell's song 'The River?).
B000LRY9PY|4.0|That says it all.  I play disc 1 on repeat, random repeat, anything just so I can hear her voice.  It's like listening to warm syrup; sweet, comforting, yet complex and interesting.  Lyrics are thought-provoking and comforting.  Disc 2 is ok, but could just as well have been left out.  Seems like it was an early recording when her voice wasn't well-developed. Disc 1 rates an 11 on a 1-10 scale; disc 2 rates a 5, the only thing keeping this review from being a five-star.
B000MQ58VI|4.0|this movie looks so good on bluray its incredible the sound is excellent to great demo movie to show what your tv can do
B000UGG39Q|5.0|Metal supergroup DOWN recorded one awesome album way back in 1995. In 2002 they released a follow up completely out of nowhere. Although some didn't think the second quite lived up to the first, I was just as impressed. The collaborated group proved that they could mix their downhome breed of heavy metal hard rock, with some old school classic rock riffery... they even threw in some electric organ.<br />Now in 2007 they have returned out of nowhere again. This time it's only been a short five years between albums, but the roads have been long for all of them. And this shows throughout this album... In my opinion, the finest of the three... DOWN once again combines the best elements of modern metal, with classic influences, such as seventies Sabbath riffery, and southern rock melodys. Alot of the writing in this one gets pretty deep, and its worthwhile on me. Some of the tunes on the other hand are just good time head pounders...the pace keeps cool throughout, but we get some of the vibe back, that I know I've been sort of missing since Pantera broke apart, and some other tragic events ensued. I don't know why fans are crapping on this one at all! Some songs that stand out THREE SUNS AND ONE STAR, BENEATH THE TIDES, and PILLAMYD....<br />Give this one a few spins and let the sound simmer on you. I'm not the biggest metal fan alive, but I know what I like and I thought this one was damned good.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I LOVE this CD. I have this and the original Hallmark one. James is so fluid on all of these songs; the whole thing is a true joy to listen to. I play this one quite often during the Christmas season. Great CD for the James Taylor fan, or anyone who just loves to listen to good Christmas music.
B000WPAG1Q|1.0|After the disappointment musically that was \\"Back 2 Basics\\" the album. I was interested in seeing how Christina AT LEAST improved as a performer. The verdict is in...this concert is just as boring to watch as her last dvd \\"Stripped\\". Although the stage settings are very elaborate & theatrical (some things I've seen on old Madonna tours)....Christina Aguilera lacks the natural charisma of an exciting performer.     Even for being touted the \\"voice of this generation\\"....her vocals sound subpar for that status. The vocals sound weak & strained...the stress is apparent in Christina's face as she shouts the notes. There were some moments of LIPSYNCHING which came as a shock to me! Normally, singers will lipsynch if its a more dance-oriented number....but she lipsynchs to mask the harder notes. Mariah, Whitney, and Celine never had to do that in their prime...it's sad how the standards have lowered.    I'll have to recommend Justin's \\"FutureSex/LoveSound\\" Live in MSG or Beyonce \\"The Beyonce Experience\\" Live at Staples Centers instead of this. These are the best male & female performers out of the young crop....definitely great gift DVDs for this holiday season!
B000I2IT44|5.0|I was given this dvd as a gift. This group was a total mystery to me. Nobody, including myself, had ever heard of this band. The only thing negative that I can say about this is that you get zero information about the band. I didn't ever know the members names until the end of the disc. I'm guessing that the band may be from England but I am not even sure of that.<br /><br />  What I am sure of is that discovering this band reminded me of Christmas morning as a little kid. The band is awesome. The lead guitar/singer is very talented and the drummer captures your attention and won't let go. The vocals were so well done and I loved how the group went from hard rock to super melodies in seconds.<br /><br />  This is a dvd that you really should treat yourself to. There is not a bad song on it and I must say that what amazes me most about this is how surprised I am that had never heard of a band that is this talented.<br /><br />  They remind me of so many different bands with their complex music and great vocals. The only reason that I rated it at five stars is because six stars wasn't an option.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Wilco is another highly-prized band that I like without fully understanding what all the talk is about, with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot being atop many critics' lists for 2002.  They apparently started out as a more or less traditional country band, but their sound has warped and twisted into what it is now, something almost completely unidentifiable with that genre.  Like a lot of well respected artists, their music isn't easily pigeon-holed, but it can be described as pop with a lot of experimentation with noises and distortion mixed in to keep it interesting.  Jeff Tweedy has a nice voice that few could find a dispute with, and he has decent range to either accompany or contrast the music.  They use a variety of instruments to add depth to the more standard rock elements, although they're more than competent at those aspects.  It's not quite the stuff that tends to really grab me, but it's not because of a flaw in the music.  The songs are expertly constructed and have a lot of heart and truth to them, it's just not what I tend to listen to.    \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\\" isn't as personally gripping as some first tracks on my favorite albums, but it does show you what Wilco is about these days, with an eclectic mix of sounds that come together and form the backing for a nice song.  \\"Kamera\\" is a more standard, pleasant song with a lot of strumming, and it's fine, just an example of what I don't like as much.  \\"Radio Cure\\" is probably my favorite on the record, as it starts sounding one way but gradually incorporates differing elements to round out the sound and holds interest throughout.  \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" leans a bit more away from their roots, and is about as nice as anything else to be found here.  \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" throws in some electronic bloops along with the standard radio pop.  \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You\\" has some real electric guitar in there, picking away and adding further schizophrenic deviations from the formula.  \\"Poor Places\\" breaks down in the end with distortion, it's a bit of a chaotic climax before the warm down of the last song.  I may grow to like this more as time goes on, but right now I see it as an enjoyable album that I'll probably only listen to once in a while.
0765342294|4.0|As of late, I have been hooked on the whole SF/Fantasy genre. Reading has a great way of helping me get my mind off of the daily grind. That said I tend to read descriptions and reviews of books prior to purchasing them. And, if I am going to read a book in a series, I tend to buy all of them at once. So, when it came to Enders Game, I decided that I would buy it and the rest of the series. I am on book 5 at present. What does this have to do with this 1st book? Well, if you want to make an intelligent buying decision, I think that you have to consider all of the books. However, you can read any of the series by themselves, but they are much more enjoyable (at least the one's I've read so far) if read together.<br />This book had me hooked from the start. Not to spoil it, but there's something here for everybody. There are times in the book that the scale of psychoanalysis becomes a little heavy, but I think in most cases, Card makes it work.<br />If you are looking for a good Sci-Fi series, this should fit the bill. I like the fact Amazon has the preview option on this book. Read it and you'll have a more than adequate indicator as to the rhythm of the rest of the book.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|I had started a trilogy of great movies and The Italian Job meet my standards for entertaining enough to own the collection.

0440238609|4.0|I thought I would review these three books as a group instead of bothering to review them one at a time. You have already read the plots on other reviews at this site I won't bother repeating them; I will just give my opinion.  The first two books are BRILLIANT!! They have become my new favorite fantasy books. I wish I could give them ten stars. They are in my opinion, some of the best fantasy/adventure litariture ever written. I reccommend them whole heartedly for fans of either genre. The third book I reccomend, as well, with a few reservations. About two-thirds of it is as brilliant as the other two but the other third really craps out.  I especially didn't like these things:    -Father Gomez- a one-note villian, twirling his long black mustache.   Pullman is capable of creating interesting multi-facetec villians (look    at Lyra's parents), but this guy was just shallow and uninteresting. He    could be cut out of new editions of the book and no one would miss him    -Mary Malone's humanistic atheistic \\"preaching\\" at the end of the novel.    Talk about heavy handed! I am an agnostic so I was not offended but    I'll bet a lot of readers with theistic beliefs will be..    Being provoctive and challenging your readers cherished beliefs are  fine but   it's obvious that pullman added Malone's ending speeches just to    irritate theist readers especially christians. Again, not needed for   story  -The love story was very moving, and yet somewhat creepy. These kids are   younger than Romeo and Juliet! I wish the author had found a way to age   Will and Lyra somehow.    I hope no one is turned off by my minor complaints about the third book. These books are my favorite fantasy novels and I highly recommend them. Also, if you like them, check out the short sequel; Lyra's Oxford.
1582701709|4.0|The value of reading this book is not in believing every individual assertion made. Instead, it's the \\"big picture\\" that makes sense. Essentially, it says that \\"what we pour our effort into, we bring\\"...the power of positive thinking. If you don't like some aspect of your life, and all you do is complain about it and worry about it and think about it, nothing will change. But if you can find a vision of what you truly desire, put yourself in a mindset that you are there, and even act like you have what you are looking for, then \\"the force of the universe\\" will help you help yourself to acheive. There are plenty of anecdotes. Some of them are too conveniently easy and grand for me to swallow. All the same,     I liked the overall message. However, don't mistake it for a \\"self help\\" book. It's interesting and can give you some perspective, but it's heavy in theory and weak on strategies. I think it's up to the reader to find your own strategies to make the concept work for you.
0316010669|3.0|Blink is about the subconscious computer we all use to think intuitively.  It explores the thought pattern that gives a leader a \\"hunch\\" about making the correct decision, or that vibe we get from first impressions.<br /><br />The book starts out with ideas on how our subconscious can be used as a powerful tool to discern a tremendous amount of information from just a few details.  What I did not expect, was that the remainder of the book focuses on how this tool can just as easily become a handicap leading to incorrect interpretations and poor snap judgments.  Blink is not about honing our subconscious computer to make better and quicker decisions, but taking a second look and avoiding the obvious mistake.<br /><br />I think marketing is the most practical application of the material.  One chapter discusses how product packaging can affect the way a consumer interprets the actual product.  For example, consumers drinking 7-UP out of a yellow can tasted more lime than drinking from a green can, despite both cans containing the same ingredients.  The author also analyzes the Pepsi Challenge of the 80s and his opinion on why Coke was never in any danger of losing the marketing battle.<br /><br />Another subconscious phenomenon examined is how one can make disastrously poor decisions under momentary pressure.  The author hypothesizes why racial police beatings like Rodney King occur.  A lot of the examples provided are about what the author considers subconscious racial discrimination, which he thinks is caused by the conditioning of living in a dominantly white society.<br /><br />Overall I think Blink was entertaining, but I don't consider most of the material very practical.  I think it would be most appealing to readers of the Freakonomics type books.  If you are deciding whether this would be a good read... I say go with your gut instinct.

B000065V3H|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies from the 80s.  I'd probably buy three or four of these as gifts for friends if it was widescreen.    With Patrick Dempsey's comeback in full swing, why no re-release of this 80s classic?  (It wouldn't need a re-release if it was done right the first time.)
0765357151|3.0|the first story was good.. I did not know it was a book of short stories. I Am Legend was only 169 pages....
0060512806|5.0|I don't quite get how people can pick up a book this size and then complain about the book's size ... isn't the book's, ah, SIZE a clue the book is going to be ... um, BIG? Sorry if that's going over a few people's heads, especially the computer scientists out there writing 1-star reviews.    My hat's off to the author - he nailed it. To make a 900+ page book entertaining all the way through takes mastery. Every storyline of this thing had me gripped, from the business to-and-fro with the Dentist to Shaftoe's war heroics - Shaftoe's one of the most entertaining characters I've yet encountered in fiction.    A book this big is generous from Stephenson. He could have written 3 Snow Crash-sized novels and maybe been paid 3 times. I'm glad he served up something like this to get lost in over a couple of weeks - every day I looked forward to picking this up and diving in.
B00081U6EG|4.0|I watched this perforformance in HD on HDNet several times.  As others have mentioned here there are some great performances, and the performance by Gary Moore certainly is incinderary.  However since the Stratocaster has been around for a long time, this concert is useful in order to be exposed to artists you would not see elsewhere.  For example, I was mesmerized by Hank Marvin's guitar playing, which illustrates that one does not have to play fast or hard in order to produce facinating sound from the guitar.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|In Babel, there are several stories taking place in different countries at the same time. They are all connected by the gift of a hunting rifle from a Japanese businessman to a Moroccan peasant.    Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are a married couple on a trip through Morocco. There is a disconnect between them because one of their children died recently. Their other children are home in the U.S. being cared for by the family's Mexican housekeeper. In Japan, the businessman's teenage daughter, who is deaf, is having trouble dealing with her physical condition, her father and her mother's suicide. In Morocco, the gun is sold to another family. The two young sons have it with them as they shepherd on the hillside. Practicing with the gun they accidentally shoot through a tour bus, injuring Cate Blanchet. Brad Pitt has to fight the language barrier as well as the other impatient tourists on the bus, to get his wife to a hospital for treatment.    Back in the U.S., their Mexican housekeeper needs to get to Mexico for her son's wedding. She has no choice but to take the children with her. On the way back that night, there is trouble at the border. Her nephew driving her, crashes the border crossing and she ends up in the desert with her charges. In Japan, a young attractive policeman comes to talk to the Japanese businessman about the gun he gave away as it has now been used in an international incident. The teenage daughter tries to seduce him, one of the many awkward ways she tries to deal with her internal pain.    Babel is an amazing movie. I saw it months ago and still think about it. It has two qualities that would normally shy me away from it; It is very long and slow paced. However, in this case, the movie is so well made and the characters so compelling I was riveted. The acting is tremendous from everyone involved. It is a beautiful movie to look at and incredibly well written, edited and directed. This should have won the Best Picture Oscar.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Is this documentary fair and balanced? Of course not. But then it's nice to see the \\"OTHER SIDE\\" after being force-fed ultra conservative, corporate propaganda for so many years.<br /><br />In an effort to attack a potential Government run healthcare system, another reviewer pointed out that \\"you get what you pay for\\" and that \\"free\\" is never as good as \\"pay\\". To which I would respond with this analogy;<br /><br />The last time I checked, Linux was a thriving OS, supported by one of the largest and most healthy programming communities ever assembled! Most users of Linux realize that it not only is a viable alternative to Microsoft products, but it's safer and more advanced in many regards. I also wonder how many people use OpenOffice, or the free Google alternatives to office? By the way, I'm also very happy with all of the books, CD's and DVD's that I check out (for free) at my local library. Thank GOD for that great socialist institution!<br /><br />If people stood up and supported one another, and took the power away from corporations that choose profit over FREEDOM and VALUE OF LIFE, then we would all be living in a better world. There is nothing wrong with expecting Government to offer free Healthcare. WE THE PEOPLE are the government, and WE THE PEOPLE need to step forward and lend a helping hand to those less fortunate.<br /><br />As a leader of your household, would you tell your young son, daughter, wife, or husband, that they needed to save their own money in case they were to fall ill, because it was not your responsibilty to take care of them?<br /><br />Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.<br /><br />JM
B000002U8G|5.0|This 1971 release is my favorite album from the group and presents a further realization of the Pink Floyd sound.  That is, while the album features the psychedelic tendencies of their late 1960s output, the blueprint for albums like Wish You Were Here (1975) was reasonably well defined.  Meddle presents a nice mixture of individually penned tracks and excellent group efforts including the lengthy centerpiece of the album, Echoes and the instrumental track One of these Days.<br /><br />The lineup at this point included David Gilmour (electric and acoustic guitars, bass guitar on One of These Days, vocals), Roger Waters (electric bass and vocals); Rick Wright (Hammond organ, VCS3 synthesizer, piano, vocals), and Nick Mason (drums and percussion).  I think that the group was in top form on this album and really pulled out the stops with respect to experimentation in the studio, especially on Echoes.<br /><br />The tracks on the album range from the band's \\"inside joke\\" Seamus (2:15), which is a blues piece played on an acoustic guitar with a slide and that features a howling dog as a soloist, to the magnificent space rock epic Echoes (23:27).  Echoes itself was patched together from bits and pieces contributed by all of the band members and is an especially fine large-scale work that features a soft and drifting vocal introductory section and a middle section that takes the concept of space rock to a new level.  Specifically, the middle section is more or less structureless and features various sound effects generated on their instruments and found sounds.  The neat thing about the arrangement on Echoes is that it seems to suspend time...while days pass in your head before reaching the closing vocal section (which restates opening themes), only twenty minutes or so pass by in \\"real time\\".<br /><br />Other great tracks include the thunderous, bass heavy instrumental One of These Days, which opens with Dave and Roger on \\"dueling\\" basses. Based upon what I have read, the differences in the tone of the two basses at the introduction (one trebly; one dull sounding) is attributable to the fact that one bass had new strings and the other did not.  Other neat things about the track include a bass guitar part played through a Binson echo unit.  I guess it is worth noting that Nick Mason speaks the phrase \\"One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces\\" on this track and the \\"wind\\" effect at the introduction of One of these Days was achieved with a white noise oscillator.  One of my personal favorites, the soft and spacey Pillow of Winds is a fairly romantic song for the band and utilizes acoustic textures nicely.  In general, although the overall mood of the album is dark and gloomy (with the exception of Seamus), San Tropez is a lighter track by Roger that presents a nice contrast.<br /><br />All in all, this is an exceptional album from a much neglected period in the overall career of Pink Floyd.  Highly recommended along with [[ASIN:B000002UA0 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]] (1967); [[ASIN:B000002U9Y A Saucerful of Secrets]] (1968); [[ASIN:B000002UA5 Ummagumma]] (1969); [[ASIN:B000002UA4 More]] (1969); [[ASIN:B000002U9W Atom Heart Mother]] (1970); the compilation album [[ASIN:B000002U0D Relics]] (1971), and [[ASIN:B000002UA2 Obscured By Clouds]] (1972).tone of the two basses at the introduction (one trebly; one dull sounding) is attributable to the fact that one bass had new strings and the other did not.

B000UR366S|5.0|Joni Mitchell has been delivering such original exquisite music for so long, it is easy to see by the reviews that it is a precarious position. My advice? Don't judge this marvelous work too soon, before the layers have been revealed.    At first, the age that has crept into Joni's voice threw me off a bit but it remains a supple, expressive and altogether remarkable instrument. No, the range is not as expansive, but a lifetime of living makes her voice even more expressive and particularly soothing.      This artful CD is a meditation, observations with no malice and an edgy prayer for us all. It is original--except for the reprise of Big Yellow Taxi and its message which seems to have been written for today. The lyrics are the same, but they reach deeper now.    It's beautifully recorded CD. The work is remarkable and easily ranks among her best. It is a recording that unfolds at its own pace and continues to reveal itself even after many playings. While Joni is still Joni, hasn't each record been a snapshot of her evolution?    Shine is both wise and sweet.
B000I0RR7Q|4.0|I've done a VERY CLOSE examination of both the HD-DVD version on a Toshiba A2 and the standard DVD version upconverted to 1080p on a Blu-ray S300, both playing over a Sony 46XBR4 TV, watching the movie in regular motion and in freeze frames.  Both look amazing, but, and here is where I was surprised, there is hardly a hair's difference in picture quality between the two.  The remaster Warner Bros. did just a few years back is so incredible on standard that you don't need to pay the extra for the HD-DVD version.  I am telling this to you honestly, don't spend two to three times as much for the HD-DVD version when the same quality is available on the standard version when you upconvert it to 1080p.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I got this DVD as a birthday present from my sister today. I had seen bits and pieces of this movie a long time ago, so I didn't remember a whole lot. I have only seen the Director's Cut (which is what I got), but alternate versions aside, this was a very cool movie.<br /><br />STORY: Donnie is a troubled young man who doesn't get along well with the family. One night, he escapes death after an airplane engine crashes in his bedroom. The being because he follows a giant bunny named Frank, a bunny who tells him that the world is gonna end. This leads him to commiting a series of crimes before it ends.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: Cool! You might not wanna watch it when you're depressed, there are a lot of depressing scenes in this movie. Yet the last 20 minutes are a series of nail-biters that will not fail to amaze you. And the ending? Good use of the song \\"Mad World\\"!<br /><br />Anyways, this is an amazing movie. Very cool, and It's a movie that's essential vewing for sure.
B0002J54KU|5.0|Produced by [[ASIN:B000002LIE Daniel Lanois]], this graceful work was Dylan's final statement of the 1980s. The uptempo Political World delivers a profound message over an urgent rolling rhythm whilst the poignant Where Teardrops Fall is melancholy and uplifting at the same time, very much like [[ASIN:B00006NSH8 Leonard Cohen]].<br /><br />Since this album was released in 1989, the song Everything Is Broken now seems to be prophetic and truer than ever. The arrangement stands out, as well as the impressive instrumental textures. With its appealing organ touches, the slow ballad Ring Them Bells has an anthemic quality and gospel undertones.<br /><br />The atmospheric story-song Man In The Long Black Coat is followed by the introspective Most Of The Time, a reflection upon lost love and memories that linger. What Good Am I? is similarly sad and reflective with thought-provoking lyrics, and the same goes for Disease Of Conceit.<br /><br />I love the appearance of the harmonica on some of the tracks like Shooting Star; it reminds me of his legendary 1960s work. With its heavenly melodies, stirring imagery and inspired soulful production by Lanois, Oh Mercy is Dylan at his very best.
0930289234|5.0|To start out, let me first say that if you are not in the mood to have to think about the importance of your existence, and how much life really is insignificant and a waste of time, then please do not read this. However, if you are not the faint of heart, this is an amazing story told with artwork to die for, and is the best example of modern comics being aimed at a higher level of audience.<br /><br />Its central theme being the cold war struggle with the clock approaching doomsday sets the tone for the story right away. Doomsday seems more possible then ever in this alternate history, and it is up to these retired vigilantes to do something about it.<br /><br />Vigilante justice is usually more about vengeance then actual justice usually, however the Watchmen is an example of vigilante justice taken to the level of trying to save the world.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Horrible. Over acted. Bad adaptation.     Knightley's overacting ruins the movie. She is too forceful and too thin, two characteristics which would never have occurred during that time period. In addition, the removal of pride and prejudice from the characters action, completely alters the original intentions of the novel.     I did however enjoy the acting by the woman who played Jane and the woman who played Mrs. Bennett; I wish I could transport them into the A&E version, which by the way is far superior to this movie.    I would not waste your money on this film and instead purchase the A&E version. You will thank me afterwards.
B0007Q6QVO|5.0|This album is very good.  Mel C always stood out from the other spice girls for me, and while I personally found her freshman album to be boring, this one is moving, well written, and beautiful.  The songs sound like a cross between Kelly Clarkson and Alanis Morisette but with Mel C's distinguishable voice, which of course definately isnt the best in the business.  For critics who cant get over her being a Spice Girl, its your loss, this is great music, from a fantastic musician who is proving her worth as a solo artist, unlike most of the other girls.  Bravo Melanie, and I hope the new CD is as good as this one.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My kids and I are big board game fans and this one is a huge hit.  I love games that are simple enough for my youngest (6) to play without assistance (after explaining the rules the first few times), but also challenge my daughter (9) and I.  My son often surprises us though and beats us at this game fair and square and that's a big plus for me as well.    The only negative I could give for this game is that it has many small pieces that would be very easy to lose.  They are quite sturdy, but could be broken if not taken care of as well because they are made of hard plastic.  I'm pretty vigilant about making sure the kids treat games properly and put all the pieces away and if you are too this drawback to the game shouldn't be a problem.
0440238609|1.0|I am growing tired of authors who think that their religious beliefs are so important to rebuff the Christian culture.  There was a time when we all agreed that we would get along and respect each other regardless of our personal beliefs.  We do have a Constitution that promotes freedom of speech and I have to support this author's right to express it.  I find with deep sorrow that I will never choose to read this novel because I would find the underlying premise disgusting and unfathomable (that God is killed).  What ever happended to reading literature to be entertained?

6300267997|1.0|This is the first review I've ever written in my life but this movie was soooooooooo bad that I had to save people the agony of watching it.  If you value your time and taste then stay away. This movie really offended me; she is sooo full of herself and annoying throughout the whole movie. The whole time I was cringing and wondering why anyone would put her in that role, why didn't they see how bad it was going from the very start but then I got my answer at the end when I found out she was the executive producer. The close ups, the songs and her lines were just not right for her. Kris K. was ok but he was way too cute for her, basically she comes into this mans life takes everything and not once does she thank him or apologize for not understanding him and when he dies she is mad at him for leaving her. This movie made me hate her. And I seriously think the whole movie was about her nails. I'm just so upset I watched this egocentric maniac for that long it was so bad that at the end I had to mute it I couldn't stand her voice anymore and most of the time I had my hand up to block her face so I could try to get into the movie. Anyway, bad bad movie and she's an ugly ugly person and not just physically.
B000W1AO0I|5.0|It was in a beautiful theatre in downtown Chicago in 1969. I flew there from Phoenix to see some old friends and to witness what I felt would be a show that could never be repeated.  Boy was I right!<br /><br />I've listened to this record countless times, gone through LPs, cassettes and CDs, and as good as it is, the recorded sound does not approach the beautiful noise those cats made on those two nights.<br /><br />It's funny. Butterfield checked out early, so did Bloomfield. White boys knew nothing about pacing themselves I guess. The old guys hung on for quite a while.<br /><br />It was years later that I met Muddy a couple of times when he came through Phoenix.  He was always performing, even in his dressing room.  He entertained visitors with his little star act, demanding and getting two bottles of the best champagne in the house, just for himself. Refused to share, even with his band.<br /><br />There was a man!! That's all that needs to be said about Muddy.
B000W1V5VU|1.0|It's interesting that this late '90's franchise derived from the 60's first major example of what the folks at \\"Seinfeld\\" might refer to as the \\"about nothing\\" syndrome. That original film was little more than a visualization of the tabloid interest in the lives of the Rat Packers, and a sad late career addition to the resume of the estimable Lewis Milestone (\\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", etc.) I would say that the original producers, at least, knew enough to stop at a single installment. However, such marginal \\"entertainments\\" as \\"Sergeants 3\\" and \\"Robin and the 7 Hoods\\" were sort of sequels. Obviously, the new series also exists primarily because of the interest in celebrities named Clooney, Pitt and Damon. I found even the superior first entry to be of limited interest. I missed the roundly panned second, and was uninvolved in this ultimate sequel...... except when Al Pacino is present. Hardly his best work, but he's just such an interesting actor. His \\"Sea of Love\\" co-star Ellen Barkin is wasted in a demeaning turn as a tough as nails, yet unbelievably mooney minion of Pacino. Finally, I concur with another review which mentioned the quality of the regular DVD. This is by far the worst major studio transfer I have seen. It's chock full of artifacts, visual distortion, and Low-Fi sound.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Alright, so I saw Britney's performance at the VMA's and I like, many of you, was shocked.  How could she go from the sweet innocent britney from 1998 to the shadow of her former self that was on that stage?  I wondered to myself, I wonder what her album will be like, and then forgot about it. A month or so later, I'm on facebook, and my friend's status is \\"Britney's new album is fire!! She did it again!\\" and I thought to myself,  \\"Really?\\"  So the next time I thought about it, I downloaded the album, listened to it...Wow.  Where do I start.  \\"Gimme More\\" is overly produced and just a headache to listen to.  I respect that \\"Piece of Me\\" is a response to her critics...but it is horribly produced and only responds to the critics about her appearance, not her behavior. The rest of the tracks (until the last two) i just lumped together because they all sounded like a horrible attempt at trying to mix techno/house and pop.  Yeah, yeah a few songs are more towards hip-hop or more towards house, but...ugh.  Oh, not to mention \\"Ooh ooh baby\\" which rips the beat off of \\"The Hey Song.\\"  Not sure who produced \\"Perfect Lover\\", but it sounds reminiscent of Timbaland...beat isn't bad...song isn't bad either.  Not GOOD, but not bad.  ON a similar note \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\"  sounds like it was produced by the Neptunes (that's more of a gimme i guess since Pharrell is on the track.  Again, not a bad track.  But for an album with twelve tracks, 2 out of 12 tracks goes  to 1 good track for every 6 and since the scale is 5 that's less than 1.  So, I must give it 1 star.  Unless you're a hardcore Britney fan (I'm so sorry if you are...you deserve better) I recommend not buying the album.  As a matter of fact, I actually deleted this album from my hard drive because I was ashamed to have it.  Check out Alicia Keys' new album or Common's new album if you want some new fresh tunes in the Hip-Hop/R&B genre...or if you want house/trance...well I can't help you there.
B000UVT3OI|2.0|I bought the US version and took it back to Europe. It says NTSC on the DVD but my player is compatible NTSC / PAL. It does not play. Though the double CD alone gives good value, the record company should have made it clear that this will not play in other regions.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I watched this show on NHK when I was a high school student. After I grow up and became 29yo, it is surprisingly nice to watch the grown actors and actress's now at interviews on Disc 6th in this box. It worth buying if you are a true fan!
B00009YXHN|5.0|Herbert West (Jeff Comb's) and Dr. Dan Cain (Bruce Abbot) are back and up to their old trick's, but not only can they resurrect the dead............they can creat new life!!!!!!! Bwhahahahahahahh!!!!!<br />What I really love about this sequel is that it has more of a 'Frankenstein' vibe, because it does'nt take place at a medical school like the original film, it take's place Herbert West's own lab (right next to a cemetary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Yeah that's right, a [..........] cemetary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ton's of special effect's on display here. It start's off with them re-animating their own little \\"pet's\\". It has some really great stop-motion animation (some of the best I've seen) and plenty of gore, nudity, zombie's, dismemberment, perversion, and disembowelment to please any gorehound.<br />This is horror/comedy done right, and while this has a little more comedy than the original film, it has a great sense of humor with a slap-stick vibe, and is extremely funny.<br />This is an awesome sequel to an already perfect movie. I loved every minute of it, and nearly had an orgasm watching it. The original Re-Animater is one of my favorite flick's of all time and even though this is not directed by Stuart Gordon, Brian Yuzna does a great job and is a very underrated director. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
B000VBJEEG|3.0|My grandchildren liked this movie as did their parents but I was not nearly as enthusiastic about the rats in the kitchen or in the sewer for that matter, when they went on to the kitchen.  The hordes of rats sort of freaked out my wife and while the movie went to great lengths to assure the audience that the rats were clean and sanitary the fact is when they raided the pantry they didn't wash their hands and did in fact contaminate the food which was later used. Thankfully the Health Department closed the place down.  Of course this is only a cartoon and shouldn't be taken too seriously.  As a cartoon it was well executed and undoubtedly appealed to its target audience.  This wasn't one of Disney's best efforts but when compared to what is generally being offered to kids on TV it is outstanding.  A cute movie, kids will love it, predictable and a little unnerving if not downright spooky at times.  Unless you have kids I think I would miss this one.
1580176941|5.0|The approach that the authors take is very well thought out and well presented.  They manage to make the steps for making these elegant cookies relatively simple. It's as if they reverse engineered the process to make it understandable to everyday cooks.  The end result is a very readable book that offers something very different than you will find in any other coookie book.  The tips throughout the book and the templates at the end make the book a real value.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a superb DVD collection, professionally done, beautiful cinematography and excellent music. The whole family enjoyed this DVD set and it makes a perfect gift.  You can buy this with your eyes closed. The DVD extras where one sees what the camera crew goes through to get the photographs is truly amazing.
0553260111|4.0|If you enjoy action, espionage, and mystery then Bourne Identity is for you.    Some have made claims that the characters are not believable, but I found the exact opposite to be true.  I also liked that Ludlum is able to make you, the reader, feel some of Bourne's confusion, without making you feel completely lost.    This book is fast paced and is nearly impossible to put down.  Read the books then go see the movies.
0440238609|4.0|I read this trilogy when I was in my early 20's and found it fascinating, a little TOO surreal and not as enthralling as some other classic fantasy stories.  No, its not like Harry Potter...its darker and there aren't the humorous word plays JK Rowling so masterfully executes and I enjoy so much.  And yes, it did drag a bit and you didn't put down the book with a light and cheerful heart-which is fine with me - I prefer books I need to think about a bit .  I decided to re-order this series to refresh my memory before seeing the movie and was amazed at the amount of venom, directed both towards religion and atheism, being shared on this page and in reviewer's comments.    For all those folks who think that these books will corrupt their children, and are promoting Narnia instead--let me just say that I grew up reading and re-reading all the chronicles of Narnia (while living in a Catholic household) and grew up to be a well adjusted and agnostic adult.  I was never influenced by the undercurrents of religion in those books, and neither did I find myself positively overwhelmed by the atheistic themes in Pullman's work.    Please consider that reading a wide variety of literature is what gives children and adults some of their insights into other people and helps them develop tolerance, insight and understanding of the very global and multi-faith (or lack of faith) world we live in today. Please, instead of banning a story whose fictional message may make you a little uncomfortable, have FAITH in your childrens' and your own ability to form opinions--if brainwashing was so easy, we'd have much bigger things to worry about than book boycotts.
0743297334|4.0|As you can tell from some of the other reviews, this is a rather strange book, with no major events or startling revelations occurring anywhere within.  That is not to say that the book doesn't have a strong message.  The redundancy and rather aimless lifestyle of the characters IS the point.  What became known as the 'Lost Generation' were known for their living without goals and becoming despondent with the day-to-day that was their life.  There is also the more subtle theme of rebirth and new beginnings that will always follow periods of despondency and helplessness.<br /><br />Narrated by the main character, Jake Barnes, THE SUN ALSO RISES drops you into and takes you through a couple months of life for a few WWI expatriates, in which nothing much seems to happen.  Drinking, talking, and occasionally fighting, Jake and his friends Mike, Cohn, Bill, and Brett take a trip to Spain for a week-long fiesta.  Jake is one of the least developed main characters of any novel I've read, being extremely non remarkable and somewhat of a pushover.  Nevertheless, you can't help feeling a great amount of empathy for Jake, despite not understanding his personal motivations.  By far the most interesting and well-developed character is Brett Ashley, a free spirited and brash lady that delights and frustrates the reader in every scene she appears in.  As the narrator is in love with Brett, it makes sense that she is portrayed in an ambiguously favorable manner.<br /><br />This book is perhaps the best example of Hemingway's styles of bare-bones description and character development through dialogue.  I'd say about half of the book is taken up by very realistic and choppy conversation among the characters.  Much of this conversation (as well as the narrators musings) seem rather inane in many parts but help develop the characters into real people.<br /><br />An excellent book and a great example of Hemingway's style.
B000000OAN|5.0|This classic Queen album should be in everyone's library.  The tracks are timeless and the talent of this band may be equalled but rarely surpassed.
B000YAF4OS|5.0|Most of Stephan King's  movies have been victim of bad criticism.  Bad adaptation of the book,  another King's cookie cutter movie, not scary, predictable......  The Mist was quite a surprise for me.<br />The movie created the illusion of I  was also trapped in the super market with them.  It made me think and wonder what those people going through this mysterious traumatizing circumstances, and what I would  and should do.<br />One of the reason this movie turned out be better Stephen King movie is it was about  us.  It was not much about the mist nor the monster in it.  It was about monster in us (human nature, mind, behavior, instinct, invulnerability, insecurity that turns us into the monster to herm and kill in order to survive in extremely traumatizing survival circumstances for best or worst)  I think because of strong acting from each casts (especially from Marcia Gay Harden and Thomas Jane) brought up this movie to next level like something equivalent to Lord of Files has accomplished.
0316010669|4.0|blink: the Power of Thinking Without Thinking, the title itself is attractive enough to make someone interested in reading this text by Malcolm Gladwell. Author has done a great job in weaving examples from a wide variety of professions, functions and areas like relationships, politics, military, medical, crime, personality, connoisseurs, etc. to illustrate his main point:<br />The Power of Adaptive Unconscious of Human Mind.<br /><br />Author states that human mind works through two strategies, the conscious strategy and through adaptive unconscious. First strategy is when use data, information and analysis to draw a conclusion and make decision, whereas second is when we make decisions on basis of that \\"gut feeling\\". This is when we act instantly on a thought which flashes in our mind and forces us to make a decision. The question now is: Is the accuracy or quality of a decision is directly related to the time and effort spent into making it? Per Gladwell, \\"Decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\\"<br /><br />Author has used technique of \\"thin slicing\\" i.e. power of our unconscious (the internal computer) to create a subjective impression using very little information., to explain this kind of decision-making. He has also cited some erroneous decisions (Warren Harding Error & an encounter in Bronx) and some great decisions from medical and military, (Cook County Hospital in Chicago & Van Riper, respectively).<br /><br />In my opinion, our brain certainly has that great power of making a split-second decision, but it is upto us, how we develop and tap that unusual potential. We can use these techniques like mid reading, facial expression recognition etc but it certainly requires practice and a certain level of expertise to utilize them for our benefit. I would recommend reading this book with an unbiased mind and think, don't just blink.
B000X5KSWM|4.0|Everyone who is familiar with the heavy metal band Nightwish, last year the band had an acrimonious split with their former lead singer Tarja Turunen. It came to a shock for every fan of the band as well as Tarja. After a year since her dismissal fromt he band, Tarja returns to the music scene with a new album. MY WINTER STORM is Tarja's second solo album. The album is a concept album, split into three parts: ITE MISSA EST, THE ESCAPE OF THE DOLL, and SUNSET, complete with eighteen tracks.<br /><br />I have to admit I have enjoy the new Nightwish album and their new singer Anette but alas I had missed hearing Tarja's operatic vocals. Thankfully I recently got a hold of her new solo album. Initially MY WINTER STORM did not impress me that much. Some of the songs left a flat taste in my mouth. Now that I am listening to the album again, the songs are starting to grow on me.<br /><br />Tarja sounds as good as she ever did when she was with Nightwish. Her classically trained vocals takes a front seat on the album. I have noticed that there is a distinct classical sound. There still is a hard rock edge but it is more subtle and it takes a back seat to Tarja's classical roots.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what to make of Tarja's cover of the Alice Cooper song \\"Poison\\". It is an interesting cover to say the very least. I wouldn't say that the song is all that hot but I don't think it is terrible either. I am more of a fan of songs like \\"I Walk Alone\\", \\"The Reign\\", and \\"Oasis\\".<br /><br />At the moment MY WINTER STORM is only available as an import. An official US release won't happen until early 2008. For people have missed Tarja Turunen, MY WINTER STORM is certainly worth checking out.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|I love all Loreena McKennit's music, but this CD/DVD combo just blew me away. I have visited the Alhambra several times and think it is one of the most beautiful places in the world...watching her perform there on the DVD was just magical. She is an amazing musician and sounds just as good live!
1582701709|1.0|I really wanted to believe such a beautiful, popular message. I did not come in as a skeptic and tried very hard to make it work for me.  But the more I listened, the more disappointed I became.  Good ideas are mixed with \\"weed\\" ideas.  Here's a few examples:    1.  In breathy, enthusiastic tones we're told that our entire lives are completely our own doing.  If we think good thoughts - good things happen.  If we think bad thoughts (even in terms of wanting to avoid those bad things) bad things happen. There's a logic to that - but . . .    It completely negates external influences. If \\"The Secret\\" is to be believed, than those who were lost during 9/11 did so because their negative thoughts drew them to this place of clamity - That teens (who often think so positively they believe themselves invincible and act accordingly) - should rarely be in a car wreck. - Or that victims of child abuse are responsible because they let those darn negative thoughts slip out?    We're told that anything (good or bad) we \\"put out to the universe\\" if done with enough belief - will be given us.  Following this alluring line of thought - with lots of \\"positive thinking\\" a man could put it out there that he wants his neighbor's wife (nevermind that she's happily married) - and he can have her. A drug addict should be able to have an infinant stash (because they certainly want it badly enough).    The Secret uses the word \\"Faith\\" frequently - but it's no longer about a faith in a higher power - but it's now all about you - \\"faith\\" in what you want. According to this, we can now substitue our prayers to the heavens (and I personally believe that God has a better perspective than I do) - for demands to the universe. Nevermind that what we want may not always be good for us.    The Secret also lists a long lineup of historical luminaries and insists that these successful people all knew \\"The Secret.\\"  But, couldn't anyone with any philosophy do the same - claim credit for other's deeds?Sorry, but this one was just more than I could swallow.
0316067598|5.0|What a good book. So proud we have people out there who want to protect  our country and the people. How they have to prepare. After reading the book you are proud of all Armed Services.
B000VT2OO0|5.0|I am so happy that all the videos have been included in this package! Take That has absolutely no exposure in America and it is nice to get everything all in one. It also includes a documentary (i.e. Interview) concerning the making of the album and tour.   Their performance at the Diana concert has been released as well.   I wish they would get some attention in America...
B0000A98ZP|2.0|Don't let this one fool you.<br /><br />While this angst-filled detention-as-confessional `80's Brat Pack flick is hailed as a banner of youthful freedom, the final resolution can't be viewed as anything but a Big Brother-ish commercial for the joys of conforming to what's socially acceptable. Think about it. Remember when the it-girl transformed the individualistic outsider into the image of what was in, and suddenly the loner became happy and accepted and wanted by the cool guy? A terrible message for anyone, but especially for kids forming a sense of self awareness.<br /><br />The Breakfast Club isn't a very good movie but obviously it somehow strikes a chord with enough people for it to have classic status and be fondly recalled on best-of lists and has been paid tribute to on everything from songs to an episode of Dawson's Creek. Me, I never saw the attraction here and don't like The Breakfast Club very much. Skip it for better `80's teen movie fare.
0761145613|5.0|I have 3 kids and have used this calendar for the last 2 years. I'd be lost without it. The layout makes it so easy to see who is doing what/when. Each family member (up to 5) gets a column on the calendar, with room to write several items each day. I don't use the stickers much, but they are cute. To top it off, I get to enjoy Sandra Boynton's illustrations on my wall all year long.
0345494997|5.0|Being from the Buffalo area, which holds a few Wright masterworks (the Darwin Martin house, and Graycliff), and loving the period of the early 20th century, I couldn't wait to start this book. Once I did, I was hooked.<br /><br />I don't want to include any spoilers here (and others here have done quite enough) so suffice to say, it's deep and literate but extremely easy to read, because Nancy Horan is so good at breathing life into these historical characters and creating a sense of time, place and detail.<br /><br />Did I like Mamah? Kind of. Did I like Frank? Not much. Did I like \\"Loving Frank?\\" I LOVED \\"Loving Frank.\\" Highly recommended. I'll be passing my copy on, and recommending this to everyone I know who loves to read.
B000002VCB|3.0|\\"Eve\\" was the APP conceptual piece about women.  I've always loved the album cover which on first glance features several beautiful women, but upon closer inspection finds their faces covered with warts (If you've never seen it......it is hard to describe).  Some of the subject matter is rather nasty with song titles like \\"You Lie Down With Dogs\\", and \\"I'd Rather Be A Man\\" pretty much ripping women from a very chauvinistic point of view.  In the end, the women get the last say with two female vocal tracks (very rare for Parson's releases) closing out the album.  Unfortunately this is probably one of the APP weaker efforts.  With the exception of the opening instrumental track \\"Lucifer\\" the music here is rather bland and has a programmed feel to it.  The vocals are all good and the lyrics decent, but the album does not hold up to the three that came before it.  The album produced one hit with \\"Dammed If I Do\\", which is a decent enough song.  Another notable feature by his absence is the lack of any vocals from Eric Wolfson.  Overall \\"Eve\\" is far from essential Alan Parsons, but it does have its moments.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|We all know the album is great. But the 2CD limited edition is worth every extra penny/ounce of time you spend tracking it down. It comes as a beautiful glossy book, with 50 pages of photos, and an amazing bonus disc featuring the encore (Human After All and Music Sounds Better With You!). BUY THIS.
B000002VCO|5.0|\\"Ammonia Avenue\\" seems to be one of the Project's more underrated works.  I have always really liked it, but sales paled in comparison to the band's previous monster hit \\"Eye In The Sky\\".  The album gets mixed reviews from APP fans.  Some love it and some loath it.  As with \\"Eye In The Sky\\" the band definitely move in a more pop oriented direction on much of this disc.  For the most part the songs are all good.  \\"Prime Time\\", \\"Let Me Go Home\\", \\"Dancing On A High wire\\", \\"You Don't Believe\\" and the instrumental \\"Pipeline\\" are all solid.  The single \\"Don't Answer Me\\" is also a decent pop track.  The real highlight of this album however, is the title track \\"Ammonia Avenue\\".  For me this ranks up with the best things APP ever did.  The track is orchestrated progressive rock in all it's bloated glory.  I really like the lyrics to it as well.  \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" would begin the decline of APP fortunes in album sales and on the charts, but the album remains one of my favorites from the band.
0440238609|5.0|I read these books 4 years ago and now ordering sets as presents.      I am truly disgusted at the reviews based on the author's personal opinion and not about the books themselves.  It is however unsurpizing that the reviews on amazon.co.uk do not have knee-jerk fears of evil satanists.  But in some ways it's funny that it's the fundamentalist Americans who liken a fantasy book that has the church torturing children in experiments that leave them as zombies to Christianity.    If you actually read the books - at least without automatically being offended - you'd realize that the actual morals are what Christianity is supposed to be.  You know... about being good and not evil no matter your excuse.  It's about totalitarianism that attempts to control all aspects of people's lives through kidnapping, assination, torture and censorship.  Never once does he mention the actual theology nor refer to Christianity.      According to the wiki:  \\"However, Pullman has found support from other Christians, most notably Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury. These groups and individuals contend that Pullman's negative portrayal of the \\"Church\\" in His Dark Materials amounts to an attack on dogmatism and the use of religion to oppress, not on Christianity itself. Dr. Williams has gone so far as to propose that His Dark Materials be taught as part of religious education in schools.\\"    If you really think that a series of books with good underlying morals yet opens minds, will ruin your children then don't let them read it.  Maybe you should also ban history books because many ideas in His Dark Materials Trilogy are from the actual history of oppressive religions.    What are you so affraid of?  Kids reading Pullman's books?  People thinking for themselves? Or Heaven forbid having alternative beliefs?
B000002VCU|5.0|I love Las Vegas, and I also enjoy gambling.  I have been to Las Vegas many times over the years and have a fondness for the city and it's outlaw attitude.  The subject of \\"Turn Of A Friendly Card\\" is basically about gambling and more specifically Las Vegas.  This album has some great lyrics and I've always love the line \\"There's a sign in the desert that lies to the west, where you can't tell the night from the sunrise\\".  Pretty much a perfect description of Vegas in one line.  The album was the first of Parson's disc to go multi-platinum and produces several huge hits including \\"Time\\" (sung by Eric Wolfson) and \\"Games People Play\\".  The finale of the album is the 5 part \\"Turn Of A Friendly Card\\" suite that pretty much sums up the gambling lifestyle to a T.  I know some people who find this album rather dull and I have even heard the used stupid to describe it, but I guess it all depends on your perspective.  For me it captures the essence of the subject matter and is another great Parsons' disc.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|This is absolutely fantastic album! It is like an orgasm for your ears. Daft Punk truly masters the art of mixing in this fantastic blend of all their past and current greats. I was at the July 27th Alive 2007 Concert @ Berkeley and this really brought me back to it. I relived the concert when listening to this CD. The crowd cheering, clapping, and singing along really adds to the ambiance of the recording. The One More Time / Aerodynamic mix was really something special and you could feel the energy of the crowd exploding!  The deluxe edition is worth the extra money because you get this really nice case which includes a booklet with pictures from the Alive 2007 tour which featured the most amazing light show I have ever seen. And the second CD has such a great mix. When you pop the second CD into your computer it goes to fullscreen and you can watch the awesomeness that was the Harder Better Faster Stronger Alive 2007 performance live; it is even cooler because it is shot from close to a hundred angle (Daft Punk handed out video cameras before the concert and told people and then compiled and mixed them into this great video!).      Overall this might be the best album Daft Punk has ever produced. I know that I love it more than any of their others (and I LOVE their others haha). I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of dance, pop, electronica, or music in general. It is a pleasure that your ear drums are begging for.     This album is just harder, better, faster, stronger, and more technologic than anything you have ever heard and you need to show it some digital love at least one more time after you originally listen to it, because we are human after all, and not superheroes. It won't be too long before da funk leaves us and we are no longer alive. So let us robot rock!
B000IOM1Y6|4.0|Parsons and company would reach their commercial peak with this album.  It outsold everything else they had done before or since and was a huge hit.  The leadoff instrumental \\"Sirus\\" is still used as the intro music for the Chicago Bulls and several other major league sports teams.  The album had several other huge hits including the title track, \\"Psychobabble\\", and \\"Old And Wise\\".  Although remains one of the band's most popular albums, it has never been one of my favorites.  With the exception of the opening \\"Sirius / Eye In The Sky\\" and closing track \\"Old And Wise\\" I find most of this album to be a step down from my favorite Parsons discs.  Not that it is bad, it is certainly a decent enough album, but compared to some of the band's other works I don't like it as much.  I am in the minority however as most Parsons fans rate this as one of the band's best so your mileage may vary on this one.
0783225857|5.0|This is another rendition of an American classic.  I had seen this movie and read the book in the past, so was there really anything new this time?  We watched it as a school project for my daughter.  She watched it as a teenager, my wife watched it as a teacher and I watched it as a lawyer and, for tonight, at least, a part-time tutor.  We each saw something in it that we had not appreciated before.  For me, the courtroom scenes were interesting, but I identified more with Atticus, the father, than Atticus the lawyer.  No matter how often you have watched this in the past, you will find something new to admire when you watch it again.  Never stop!
B000002MQ9|5.0|Although I have owned [[ASIN:B00002428M Spleen and Ideal]] for several years, I had never listened to it and certainly pretended I liked it more than I really did. When I first bought \\"Within The Realm of a Dying Sun\\" (luckily, just before it went out of print!) I did not play it and feared it was soft \\"new age\\". The truth, though, is: it could not be further from that.<br /><br />On [[ASIN:B00002428M Spleen and Ideal]] Dead Can Dance developed a sound that, though often thought of as folk, actually is more like playing a Parliament vinyl record at 7rpm. Here, though, they take it a step further so that the beats, which like Liz Fraser's voice in the Cocteau Twins, are hard to hear without good, high-resolution headphones.<br /><br />The stunning opener \\"Anywhere Out Of This World\\" sets the tone perfectly. Soft, funky beats over a big voice, a cross between folk and soul, create something so dark, deep and passionate as to be utterly compelling even if the lyrics remain totally mysterious. \\"Windfall\\" is much slighter even with the tinkling piano that makes it dreamy as well as quiet, but the power of Perry's voice elevates \\"In The Wake of Adversity\\" far above most songs of this type. This is not spontaneous emotion like one finds on metal or punk, this is feelings hidden too deep in the heart for most to want to listen.<br /><br />\\"Xavier\\" is in the vein of \\"Anywhere Out of This World\\", yet even manages to surpass it. The quiet yet intense piano line conveys more words than most lyrics ever could, and Perry's voice has the force of a wall of sound. The (audible) line \\"deep in the heart where the mysteries emerge\\" sums up the whole purpose of \\"Within the Realm of a Dying Sun\\" and Perry's philosophical ruminations are better than anything by [[ASIN:B000002LSF Jane Siberry]] or [[ASIN:B0001MMGEU Judee Sill]].<br /><br />The second side opens with \\"Dawn of the Iconoclast\\", with Lisa Gerrard's passionate voice taking over to superb effect. On \\"Cantara\\" a hypnotic single-note intro for over a minute gives way to one of the most purely piercing vocals you will ever hear and an ecstatic crescendo rivals anything. \\"Summoning of the Muse\\" shows Lisa chanting in an almost guttural fashion, whilst closer \\"Persephone (The Gathering of Flowers)\\" is even quieter than the rest of the album but still has remarkable dynamics.<br /><br />\\"Within the Realm of a Dying Sun\\" is a really dark and intense record that will prevent you from relaxing when you hear it. The vocals and rhythms are virtually soul music distorted via a slow and soft pace that stood in serious and total opposition to the \\"hard and fast\\" trend of the era's \\"underground\\", but managed to convey much deeper, harder-to-express feelings. Dead Can Dance are definitely an extreme acquired taste, but their music rewards the patient like no other.<br /><br />The fact that nobody has come close to emulating \\"Within the Realm of a Dying Sun\\"'s character actually make it stand out even more.es way to one of the most purely piercing vocals you will ever hear and an ecstatic crescendo rivals anything. \\"Summoning of the Muse\\" shows Lisa chanting in an almost guttural fashion, whilst closer \\"Persephone (The Gathering of Flowers)\\" is even quieter than the rest of the album but still has remarkable dynamics.    \\"Within the Realm of a Dying Sun\\" is a really dark and intense record that will prevent you from relaxing when you hear it.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|This movie deserves at least 4.5 average rating at Amazon. As a Die Hard series fan, I totally enjoyed this movie which I rarely did with most other Hollywood movies recently. What distinguishes Die Hard series is John McClaine's sense of humor, logical and gripping story development, and some good action scene. The last one is not essential for a good Die Hard movie however is somewhat amplified in 4. Die Hard 4 still does pretty well on the first two, but certainly not as well as Die Hard 1~3. Nevertheless, it is still better than most other Hollywood action flicks.
B00005J6UP|2.0|I remembered this moving growing up, and couldn't wait to buy it for my children.  I was shocked to see all the cuss words they had thrown in this movie.  Why do movie writers feel the need to put these words in?  They add nothing to the story.  Yet another great adventure movie that is tarnished...
B000QXDED6|1.0|This is a monstrous, racist, propagandistic, jingoistic, semi pornographic (sexual as well as violent), war mongering cartoon of a movie equivalent to pro wrestling permeated with sadism and the grotesque. It is pure trash for the mind and the soul as well as an insult to everyone that lived during that historic battle. Those were real human beings who deserve to be represented with some degree of fidelity. 300 is an advanced \\"Triumph of the Will\\" with special effects to dazzle the audience into a frenzy of hatred. I think that if any ethnic group in the United States were misrepresented as the Persians are in this movie it would be grounds for defamation if not labeled a hate crime.

I broke all speed records getting my credit card to the sales desk and then tore home to devour yet another Follett book. But this one, like \\"Pillars\\" was not the usual page turner, especially since there are over a thousand pages. You can read the plot on other reviews. I only want to say that it took several hundred pages before I could get into this book. The similarity in the characters' names was confusing and made it difficult to follow throughout the story. I enjoyed the book very much and am devasted that it had to end.  I would not recommend this book to my husband as it read more like a romance novel.
B000ZM1MGE|4.0|Midnight Express is the 1978 film adaptation to the autobiographical book by Billy Hayes. The book and film tell of Hayes' attempt to smuggle drugs out of Turkey through an airplane flight.<br /><br />I first saw this film a long time ago in a health class shown to the class as part of a drug lesson. I have always been a big fan of \\"Based on true stories films\\" so I saw this with an opened mind. I didn't expect it, however, to be this good!<br /><br />Brad Davis' portrayal of Billy Hayes is one to be remembered. The script is written by Oliver Stone and Alan Parker's directing is excellent. However my only complaint is the fact that the film seems to have a few  differences from the book that are either left out or replaced by something fictional.<br /><br />I really recommend reading the book as it is an actual account of what happened to Hayes but I recommend also watching the film purely to see great film-making. The book I recommend for those who want to get an actual knowledge of what really happened.<br /><br />Info on the DvD itself:<br /><br />From [...]<br /><br />Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has announced a 30th Anniversary of Midnight Express which stars Brad Davis, Bo Hopkins, Randy Quaid, and John Hurt. This two time Academy Award winner will be available to own from the 5th February, and should retail at around $19.94. Extra material will include a commentary with Director Alan Parker, a Producers' featurette, a Production featurette, a Finished Film featurette, a photo gallery, and the original theatrical trailer. Topping it all off will be a photo booklet and essay from Parker's on-set experiences. We've attached the official package artwork below.
0446528056|5.0|Lovely story, great lesson to learn at the end of the book. Go read it!
B0000DD79B|5.0|I'm a fairly new fan of Simon and Garfunkel.  This album is a great collection of their most-popular songs, and I've listened to it over and over again.
1582701709|1.0|I listened to the first few chapters of the audiobook and was cringing every step of the way. The so-called Secret presumes that every person in this earth has freedom and a life untouched by war, poverty, and persecution. As someone from a developing country, the book's sweeping statements about our thoughts bringing about destructive and oppressive situations, \\"without exception\\" due to the law's \\"infallibility\\" is ridiculous, unenlightened, and groundless. As a Christian, the book's emphasis on acquiring material wealth and emphasizing self-gratification and pleasure rather than generosity and sacrifice made me think that this book even detracts from living a meaningful existence and rejoicing in the struggles and suffering one must go through in life to make one stronger and more human. Its blatant use of big names like Einsten, Beethoven, and Socrates in a sickening repetitive manner in order to boost its credibility is enough to make these greats turn in their graves. The philosophers and \\"teachers\\" in the book sound more like gym instructors who have had little life experience. Everyone is better off learning from the works of true masters and teachers, as well as philosophies and religions that have stood the test of time, rather than this self-promoting commercial.
B000I2JKC4|3.0|I rushed to throw this disc in my HDDVD player only to be horribly disappointed. The other guy that reviewed this title today should get his eyes checked. This is the exact video quality as is on the standard dvd, which I also own. It is not remastered at all. Save your money and buy the standard dvd if you want this title.    This movie was obviously rushed onto HDDVD just in time to take advantage of consumers for the holiday season. I feel absolutely ripped off.    The 3 stars is solely because this is a great movie, and also one of the worst HDDVD transfers I've seen so far.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Hands down the BEST Rock debut album of all time. Released in 1976 and 30+ years later every song on this album still gets radio air play. One of the all time best selling classic rock albums. NO rock collection should be without this recoding. From More than a Feeling to Let me take you home tonight, every song is what 70's rock and roll was and is all about. Sadly singer Brad Delp passed away in early 2007, however, his voice lives on and is at it's best with this CD. Don't hesitate buying this selection. IT IS A MUST HAVE! Enjoy.
0064440346|5.0|This Arnold Lobel classic should be a fixture on every child's bookshelf. Owl is a gentle soul with whom children can identify, even as they laugh at Owl's silly responses to mundane events in the world around him. Humor ensues when Owl goes too far in anthropomorphizing (tytomorphizing?) winter and the moon, and when he mistakes his own feet for scary bumps under the bed. These stories are a natural for bedtime on a cold winter night, cuddled up under the blankets just before drifting off to sleep.
B000063UR2|5.0|This is a movie that you can't pass up. Especially if you like fantasy/myth type mlovies. This has one of the better good vs evil story lines. Tom cruise, Mia Sara, Tim Curry are all excellent. Great story line, great Special Effects and an excellent collectors edition DVD with bonus extras. I just watched this on a 50\\" plasma and it was superb! This is a great movie and one not to be passed up. I hope you enjoy it as much as I.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|Boston's follow up to their #1 selling debut record.  Another excellent recording that no collection should be without. Title track \\"Don't Look back\\" is an excellent track that still gets tons of radio play today. Combined with other excellent tracks like a man I'll never be and Used to bad news. Don't hesitate on buying this great LP from one of the most respected rock and roll bands of all time.  Enjoy!
1594489505|4.0|While I personally liked Kite Runner better, this book also did not disappoint.  It was at times gut wrenching, and emotionally difficult but in the end a rewarding read. Afghanistan has always been a place of interest for me and this episode in it's history, which is far from over (the taliban are still around) is a reminder to all of us who take freedom for granted sometimes. Man or women, this is a good book to read.     I had also seen the movie Usama earlier that the book reminded me of. If you haven't seen that, then you should as well.    However, it's definitely interesting to experience what happened in afghanistan in first person, albeit fictional.
0425188809|5.0|This is by far Koontz's best work.  This has been my favorite books for years, I've reread it so many times.  The plot twists are amazing and the end is unexpected and perfect.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|A great description of this movie is &#34;A movie that sings.&#34;  It is very rare that a film speaks to me as this one has.  As an aspiring film maker I can only close my eyes and pray that I could ever make something as beautiful as this movie.  I am going to make it a personal goal of mine to make sure everyone close to me gets to see this!
0525950079|5.0|This is another great Follet book. Not since, Pillars of the Earth has Follet written such an encompassing story. (Although, his early novel Paper Money was very good).<br /><br />If you like books where the characters are so well drawn you feel like you are living there, then this is a must read!<br /><br />Follett is a master in his of understanding how humans think, plot and scheme, and how the whims of fate can change lives that seem completely planned and organized. All of this is set in 12th century England; a magnificent medieval setting with court intrigue, pious devotion, devious priests, terrible illness and the whims of nature and fate! What more could you want?<br /><br />If you like a good hefty historical novel with a great plot, detailed environment and characters that are well drawn and engaging this is a novel you will love! You will not be disappointed. The book is long, but it has a lot going on and is not at all bloated. There are several stories being told, but they are all intertwined and the elimination of one would be a great loss for those of us who love well written historical novels.<br /><br />Not since Edward Rutherford has a writer written about a time and place so well that you feel as if you are living in the 12th century until you have to leave the story for some reason and return to the 21st.
0385520298|4.0|The story concerns a young Chinese woman who is sent to London by her parents.  She is to enroll in an school to study English, and then come home after a year to work in her family's shoe business.  She meets, falls in love with, and eventually lives with an englishman.  The book's conceit is that, as the protagonist's command of English improves, so does the writing.  It's a fascinating study of how the ability to express one's self directly correlates with the amount of feeling expressed.  There are also some great facts about the inherent differences between the English and Chinese languages, both spoken and written, and how each language encourages expression (or suppression) of certain things.  Compelling reading, thoughtful, and very true to life.  Recommended!  Curl up with a hot drink on these cold winter days and enjoy a lovely, thoughtful novel.
B0000026WD|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"Dangerous\\" was released in 1991.  This was after \\"Thriller\\" (the best selling album of all time) and \\"Bad\\" (became the second best selling album of all time).  Most people consider those two (along with \\"Off The Wall\\") to be his best work.  But I think they're wrong.  I think this is his best work ever.  In fact, I'll go so far as to say that this is the best album in the history of music!  From the infectious beats on \\"Jam,\\" to the emotional \\"Heal The World\\" and \\"Will You Be There,\\" this album goes to so many different places and does a great job at it!  Michael Jackson is \\"The King Of Pop\\" and this album proves it!  Buy this album right now!!  Trust me, you will not be disapointed.    PS - I also reccomend the \\"Dangerous - The Short Films\\" DVD, because the videos are just as captivating as the music!!!
0440238609|5.0|ok, i MAY have bead on why a lot of so-called 'christians' are up in arms about these books. never made much sense to me, especially since a lot of christian religious leaders worldwide have given good reviews of these books, especially a few years ago when they were originally published, and the stupid movie wasn't being talked about.    from reading a few of the christian reviewers here that seemed fairly articulate, i was struck by the furor over the word 'daemon'. all of you guys are mistranslating the word. here's the dictionary definition from dictionary.com -     dae·mon      /dimn/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[dee-muhn] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation  -noun  1. Classical Mythology.  a. a god.  b. a subordinate deity, as the genius of a place or a person's attendant spirit.  2. a demon.  Also, daimon.    [Origin: < L daemn a spirit, an evil spirit < Gk daímn a deity, fate, fortune; cf. daíesthai to distribute]   '    Pullman's uses it as in definition b. a human's attendant spirit.    if any of you were technologically or scientifically educated, you would not have reacted so, because the word 'deamon' in computer science language refers to a certain type of system monitoring software that runs continuously. also a benign usage of the word.    get a grip people, the books are great for everyone; the 1st movie will not be because it strips out almost all of the 'religious/christian' controversy anyway and will be a boring 'cartoon' with no story depth.    i also think that the controversy has gotten out of hand on purpose by some people so that the movie will make lots of money because everyone will want to see what the BIG DEAL is about. don't bother, read the books.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|I know that this sounds like a great purchase, and it would be, but 9 times out of ten, the one you recieve will be broken.  Just look at these reviews...the first account of a defective set was from January, 2006!  And that's almost what all reviews report onward.  That's almost 2 years!!!  I called HBO to see if there were lot numbers to avoid, but they told me they had no list of defective lot numbers published.  It's a shame they haven't issued a recall.  I took a chance and purchased this set from amazon two weeks ago, and sure enough...it was defective.  Some episodes just don't play at all.  Just to clairify, this problem is not limited to Amazon's copies; just check others websites too!  Let's face it...do you really want to spend almost $200.00 dollars on something you'll probably just end up returning.  The only way you can know if your set is defective is to watch EVERY EPISODE to see, and you have to do that within the 30 day return policy.  It will take forever.  Speaking of returns... when I discovered my set was broken, I immediatley called amazon on the phone and spoke to an indian woman who gaurenteed me a FULL refund since defective products are considered Amazon's error.  She emailed me a prepaid shipping label, and I put the package in a UPS box.  Three days later, I recieve an email saying the reason for return was: \\"customer ordered wrong item\\"  WHAT?!  and there's more: from the refund, they charged me for the \\"prepaid shipping\\", and a $99.00 restocking fee!! I only got refunded for half of what I paid for it!  I immediately called Amazon and thankfully got it sorted out immediately.  BOTTOM LINE:  Save money, fear, and time by buying each season individually which is what I ended up doing.  I know it isn't as convenient as having the show in one box, but when it comes down to it, what are you buying it for: to watch the series, or to look at the box?
B0002KVUKM|1.0|This is, hands down, the worst movie I have ever seen. I honestly don't even know where to begin... from the nonsensical plot, over-reliance on special effects, lack of chemistry, poor casting and a baffling amount of rope swinging (!). Don't waste your time.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|I have to confess that after the second season when they killed off Kate, I lost interest in NCIS for a while.  However, when I got Season 2 DVD and learned that Sasha Alexander wanted out, I guess I felt a little better.  Now I've seen Season 3 and Season 4, and it's a whole new experience.  I'm enjoying NCIS all over again.  The interaction among the characters is what makes this show.  Yes, the crime drama elements are there:  Crime scene, forensics, and investigating, but it's so much more.  You even have to like Tony, even when you want to pop him on the back of his head -- and are so glad Gibbs did.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I had doubts about this product first because i have two strollers, each with completely different types of handles. But it fit perfectly to both of my Quinny zapp and Quinny speedi strollers. I can put my keys, phone, water bottle etc. I don't like carrying bags so this is a life saver for me.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|AMAZING GRACE is a great movie based upon the true story of the work of William Wilberforce who fought to end slavery in the British Empire.  It's a great movie, just for the historical information.  However, it is also a wonderful encouragement for anyone facing what seems to be an insurmountable task.  William Wilberforce eliminated slavery in pieces --eliminated trading, reduced the number of slaves per ship, etc., while he was working to end slavery out and out.  Any task that seems too much can be done in pieces if we do not give up.  That is a word of encouragement for all of us.
B000VLOKQI|4.0|Alot of new up to date information. Not enough concert footage. Would be better with complete song videos.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|It's like a car wreck you can't look away.    We have a 13-year-old son who we snagged into watching this with us. At first he was not interested. So his mom and I started watching. Then he got sucked in.     The show is great because it's entertaining, and it also resonates very deeply with any current or former teenager's life. Even though it's set in a very specific time, the show is timeless (the show was aired the year my son was born), but it's realistic in its portrayal of an actual, ordinary teen social world in a way that no other TV show or movie has ever captured.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|This to me is probably the best live cd I have heard. All the songs we know and love are mixed perfectly. Daft Punk really knows how to put on a show. I do believe that if you are new to daft punk you shouldn't pick up this cd. The great part of this cd is to be surprised and see how well they mix the the songs. Knowing all these songs by heart and hearing them in a whole new way is what makes this cd amazing. If you are new to daft punk you may not see the greatness. For any Daft Punk fan do yourself a favor and buy this cd!
1897299192|5.0|Moomin is one of the most brilliant, quirky, funny and thoughtful comic strips ever made. Cleverly drawn, highly imaginative writing.  Of Swedish origin myself I was lucky enough to grow up with Moomin, and also to find a complete set of the original 10 Moomin books (in Swedish) many years ago. I have always loved the characters, their adventures, interesting philosophies and opinions, and interpretations of the world, etc. I am very happy that these books (the first two at least) are finally re-issued in English so my kids can read them, and the rest of the US. Highly recommended to both young and old. Please buy the first and second book, so the publisher releases the other 8 books too.
B000068OCS|5.0|I saw this movie ages ago...It still holds up, and couldn't be more significant than it is today with the state of the world!
B000LGZHDS|4.0|My daughter ordered this for her birthday with a gift card she had received.  She loves Gary, but the shipping was MORE then he was which ate up her whole entire card.  I wasn't too pleased with that as a Mother.  So beware of overpriced shipping!
B000005JA8|5.0|\\"Mousetrapreplica\\", the subtitle for the song \\"The Blimp\\", provides an apt description of this album as a whole:  Many people will be scared off and skeptical at first exposure, but those tempted to hazard a second or third listen may be caught in the spell of this album, never to leave again.      I had been a fan of a wide range of eclectic music for some time when I first came across Captain Beefheart via Trout Mask Replica.  I was nevertheless utterly unprepared for the aural onslaught that followed.  I felt as though I'd been shaken by the Captain himself through my speakers, a somewhat unpleasant experience.  What differentiates me from the one star reviewers is that I had the chutzpah to go back for more (sadistic, maybe), feeling determined to \\"figure out\\" what this was all about.      This is what will make the difference between loving and hating this album, it requires complete attention and an active listener.  For anyone willing to give this album time, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and rewards aplenty for reaching it.  What at first seemed unhinged and cacophonous eventually revealed an intricate structure and inner logic which must be heard (many times) to be fully appreciated.  But that's the beauty of this beast:  It provides increasingly enriching listening experiences which continue to reveal new information and insights with every listen, a quality found in great art of any type.    In time, individual instrument parts become clear, revealing a brilliant use of contrast and counter-point.  Rhythms which once sounded cluttered swing and shift in bouncing polyrhythmic ebullience.  It becomes apparent that every space in the music is as purposeful as every note, and that everything has been planned and rehearsed to a T.  The band manages to swing and rock in a staggering contrapuntal effect to the exacting nature of the compositions.  Not a second is wasted.    Also revealed through repeated listenings are the various influences on themusic.  While there is certainly no precedent for this album, much of the music and lyrics harken back to folk, jazz, songster, blues, sea shanties, and other traditional American musical idioms.  These are amalgamated with Beefheart's unique vision to create a sprawling, pastoral, utterly unique vision of Americana.      If you revere music as a valid art form with vast potential, and appreciate albums as you would a fine wine, this may be for you.  Just remember that things are not always what they seem, and that there is a finite limit to how much audio information you can absorb and understand in one sitting.  If you're prepared to take the bait, count on getting hooked.
0786868694|4.0|This book is a work of art, it is so nice to look at that you forget you are reading a cook book. I like it, but use it very infrequently because I have two little toddlers and spending an entire day cooking is not what happens around our house on a regular basis. Maybe when they get a bit older. Right now it is another one of those books that just is not happening right now.
1400034779|5.0|This is a unique and very entertaining book. Smith's warmth and sense of humor shine thru every page. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and really look forward to reading the rest of the series.
0743277708|5.0|Never in your life have you envisioned rabbits the way that Richard Adams portrays them in this book. They are leaders, followers, thinkers and most importantly heroes. They travel far away from their homeland warren and are just incredibly complex and interesting to read about. Some classics you read and you ask, why is that a classic? Others you read and instantly know exactly why it is a classic. This book is a true classic.
B000VBJEFK|2.0|The content is great. The Blu-Ray implementation however is incredibly BAD. Most high-def disks are plagued with the security driven delays and failure to resume or pause the film easily. This one is an order of magnitude worse. Even with the latest firmware on my Pioneer Elite player, it can take several minutes to start or return to the film. Leave it paused for a few minutes and the disk will require going through the several minutes to reaccess, at which time you then need to step through the chapters etc.     These guys have got to be kidding! My wife said she won't watch another one and got up  and left the room in frustration.
0064434095|5.0|Even my little 3 yr old knows what!! This a a very fun book. The circular story makes it a hit, and the illustrations are great. We love the other books by this author as well: If You Give a Moose a Muffin ,is the ultimate best. Well, maybe it just depends on what animal you like to read about the most!
B00006CXSS|5.0|When, I wonder, will the people who put together DVD packages stop detracting from their products with impossibly complicated boxes and disc holders.  The fanfold construction of this package requires a table to get to the first disc.  Others with double discs that require removing one disc to get to the other are just a pain.  It's possible with slim cases which hold one disc per side to keep the packaging costs down (not, I suspect, a consideration in the case of BoB) without making them impossible to handle.  I know it can be done because I've been doing it and throwing away the insides of the original packaging.    That said:  BoB is one of if not the best thing I have yet seen on DVD.
B00000AOUD|1.0|Terrible CD recording. Sounds like it was processed at too fast of a speed. I can't even enjoy listening to it. It sounds comical it's so fast.<br />Terribly disappointed,<br />Tom

B000VI70WM|4.0|I'm an old straight guy who has loved DD from adolesence in the early 80's to his burgeoning 40's in the '00's.   I've purchased albums (33s that is), tapes, CDs.  The technology has changed but my anticipation, joy and disappointment hasn't.  I first listened to RCM online from a 'major music site'.  I didn't have liner notes or anything physical to guide me through the journey - just my laptop and some decent noise-cancelling headphones.  I'll be honest, I've been yearning for a DD release to harken back to those halcyon days of 1981-1984.  At first I was I disappointed.  \\"Where's Roger?  Where's Andy??? Where's John's bass?? My godness, what have they done to my band!??\\" I asked myself.     It's been about a month now, and I haven't stopped listening to RCM!  I've let go of some of my hostility towards heavily produced beats, synth bass, highly  sequenced percussion and I'm listening and more importantly ENJOYING!   The melodies are strong and infectious!  The songwriting and lyrics are probably the strongest they've been in years.  I've not hummed more tracks from a Duran Duran album since maybe Medazzaland - a forgotten classic in my opinion.  As a another reviewer put it, 'I don't know how or why but it works!'       The guys have put away the frilly shirts and jodhpurs from '81 a long time ago and moved on stylistically.  They've embraced technology and the zeitgeist of music and pop culture and filtered it honestly and successfully through the essence of who Duran Duran are...a band.  There are definitely musicians, band members, with influence and ideas at the core of this release, it's slick, it's polished, and to the casual listener it may seem like yet another amorphous, overproduced pop offering of the 21st century but that would be a wholly inaccurate pronouncement.    Yes, I want the band, the sound, the times I knew in my youth and when I do I'll go back to Rio, Duran Duran etc.  However, when faced with an onslaught of just plain awful pop music oftoday, I've got Duran Duran and RCM.

B000UR9T8C|4.0|I bought this DVD for my 16 year old brother-in-law.  He loved the movie, loved the action, and wasn't too perturbed by the strange \\"emo-Peter Parker\\".  So I think it was a great movie for him :)
B00008K7AM|3.0|As utterly uninspired and ridiculous as `The Hot Chick' is (and what Rob Schneider movie isn't utterly ridiculous) I couldn't help but find it funny.  Sure, none of the laughs are really original and none of them are smart or witty in the way that some newer comedies have been but `The Hot Chick' will succeed it smacking your funny bone around quite a bit.  It's stupid humor, and as can be assumed by the main star and the subject matter it's going to be `dirty' humor as well, but it's humorous and that's what counts.<br /><br />The story revolves around rich snob Jessica and petty thief Clive who magically switch places after a pair of cursed earrings cross their paths.  I know, I know, the beginning is a total `Mummy' rip off but come on, it's stupid yet funny.  Anyways, with this pair of earrings in their possession (each has one half of the set) they wake up in the others body and that's when everything hits the fan.  Clive is happy with his newfound situation since he realizes he can use Jessica's body to make much more money but Jessica is devastated to wake up in Clive's body (who wouldn't be) and so she enlists the help of her best friend April and a slew of other girls to get her old body back.<br /><br />This is far from an original idea and the funny is far from fresh, but it's still extremely funny.  It's predictable as all get out but it's mindless fun and sometimes you just want to sit back, turn off the brain and soak in the funny.<br /><br />Rob Schneider is not the most talented actor or even the funniest comedian but here he does serve up laughs effectively.  I just love Anna Faris.  She has that whole `sweet girl' shtick brilliantly and while this is not her best performance it is still delightful.  Michael O'Keefe and Melora Hardin are effective as Jessica's troubled parents who look to their mysterious gardener (Clive, er um, Jessica) for advise.  The rest of the cast is hot or miss and no one else really has enough screen time to justify a shout out but no one takes away from the film and Adam Sandler's cameo is quite memorable and entertaining.<br /><br />So, it's not perfect, not even close, but as far as commercial comedies go it's worth watching at least once.  Just know not to expect anything revolutionary or thought provoking, but I'm sure that you can ascertain that by the cover of the DVD, let alone the name that occupies the `starring' slot.out but no one takes away from the film and Adam Sandler's cameo is quite memorable and entertaining.<br /><br />So, it's not perfect, not even close, but as far as commercial comedies go it's worth watching at least once.

B000QQFKYE|5.0|Don't buy this movie before working your way up through a David Lynch progression, for example Blue Velvet > Mulholland Drive > Lost Highway. At that point one can ask, \\"Are you with me so far?\\" If so, then let's go all the way. As in other David Lynch movie, dream/delirium and the internal unconscious interact with the so-called real world. Symbols and symbolic people abound, or in the case of the rabbit-people, bound. The commentary on movie-making is sublimely funny. You may think IE is too long but the bonus material, \\"more things that happened\\" prove that, like life, IE is too short. Like life, you can take the dvd in stages. A long unveiling of sufferings by \\"Nikki,\\" as amazingly played by Laura Dern, to psychiatrist-guy concludes with the story of how Nikki's mother had her hand squashed by one of those stamping machines that make corn-cob end-holders (you probably knew all about the manufacturing process, but it is helpful to insensitive people like me to be reminded that all such things are made by real people or in this case, unreal people). Her mother's hand was squashed \\"flat as a pancake.\\" Finally psychiatrist guy utters his first words, \\"I like pancakes.\\"<br /><br />Watch this movie with someone you love so that you can discuss it. I think Nikki is a dream manifestation from the old woman's unconscious. My wife disagrees. Probably if I read the many reviews I could learn the \\"correct\\" interpretation, and perhaps one day I shall.
B000U7169M|2.0|If you know all about Moses and the 10 plagues in the Bible, then you know what will happen next starting with the river turning red.  It's so predictable that it's boring.  In addition, there's no scare factor.<br /><br />Wanna know what the movie is about?  Read the other reviews.<br /><br />Overall, don't waste your time with this movie.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is a multilevel masterpiece that I enjoy again and again. Own the movie so that you can appreciate its puzzles, artistry, dream symbols, unforgettable characters, and commentaries on the nature of film-making, the nature of evil,  and the mysterious connection between our inner and unconscious worlds and external reality. It will provoke emotions ranging from pathos to funny/funny. Naomi Watts gives an unforgettable performance surrounded by marvelous performances. If you watch this movie once and emerge totally confused, don't dispair! There are excellent explanatory reviews that can give you the basic roadmap from dream to reality. If you need help, read a couple of reviews, but find your own meaning! Once you understand that the first part of the movie is dream/delirium you will probably quickly perceive how the dream frays and then breaks, and the main features fall pretty simply into place.  If that doesn't work, try Blue Velvet. If you love it, don't hesitate to watch Lost Highway, and on the 13th floor you will finf Inland Empire. Mulholland Drive is a great movie to share. It is a love story. My wife does agree that Winkie's = Denny's but I will never be able to convince her that the evil-personifying \\"man\\" behind Winkie's is actually Diane Selwyn's dream substitute for her horrid former roommate. And that is perfectly OK.
B00000K3CM|4.0|The Home Alone movies are, and probably forever will be Christmas Classics!     The plot of Home Alone 2 is Kevin (Maculay Culkin) becomes seperated from his family around Christmas time one again. Only this time, he's home alone....in New York City! Apparently, by some confusion at the airport Kevin boards the wrong plane, and instead of going to Miami with his family, he finds himself alone in New York.     Now, a normal 10 year old boy would be scared, and explain to the adults working at the airport that he's borded the wrong plane, and become seperated from his family. However, Kevin is no ordinary boy, especially since he's got his Dad's personal travel bag with his Credit cards and money! To make the situation more interesting, the Wet bandits from the first Home Alone movie (Marv and Hary) have escaped from prison, and they are hiding from the police in.......New York city.     Once you see both of these factors come into play in the movie, you know it's only a matter of time before Kevin crosses paths with Marv, and Harry. When it does, the fun and excitement commences!    I agree with the other reviews that stated this movie has a bit much violence and might not be suitable for the really young audience. I believe I was 10 years old when this movie first came out, but I never seen it at the theatre. My mother rented it, so I was probably 11 whenever I first saw the movie.     Some good things to look for in this movie is the scenes where Kevin is running around New York. Time square, Rockerfeller center, the Plaza Hotel are just a few. The camera shots and angles of certain parts of New York were beautiful, and of course, there is one scene I'm sure that will at least \\"touch\\" everyone in some way. I'm talking about the scene where Kevin approaches the Twin Towers, and is left amazed at their size in person. Even better is the next scene where Kevin is on top of the twin towers, and is taking pictures of the view over New York city.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|I TOTALLY agree with Damon Devine from Los Angeles, CA when he said that only people that has great music sense would think this cd was B.S(not his exact words but the shoe fits). This CD is straight up garbage. I mean hell i give credit where credit is due and thats why Gimme More is the ONLY one i gave a star for otherwise she wouldn't even get that and even that song was 'aiiight'. I use to like Britney and the chick fell off.
0930289528|5.0|Allan Moore's V FOR VENDETTA is a true classic in the world of graphic novels. The atmosphere of paranoia and repressed angst created here is unique in its genre. You rarely find such depth of characterization in comics. If you've read any of the other reviews, you surely know the plot by now so I'll skip a synopsis. What I find so appealing about this work is the mystery that is \\"V\\". How one man can be a catalyst for change in an oppressive society is actually an upbeat concept at the core of this dark story.<br /> In an interesting style MOORE tells his story strictly through dialog with little to no narration or thought captioning. The pictures tell the story and although somewhat sparse, the artwork by DAVID LLOYD is a perfect fit for the Orwellian world of post world war 3 fascist England. I felt this was better than MOORE's later work, the critically acclaimed WATCHMEN. While that is a good story, I found it somewhat pretentious. V FOR VENDETTA is excellent and is one of the best graphic novels I've ever read. 5 stars.
B00000K19E|5.0|Some may argue with me when I say that this film loves violence.  They might use terms like \\"panders to\\" and \\"wallows in\\" instead.  But what convinced me was a single shot: the falling, in slow motion, of scintillating spent shell casings from the helicopter, during the rescue of Morpheus.  It was then that it hit me: the Wachowski brothers were not giving us that shot in order to pump up the violence/action.  They were doing it because they intuitively understood the sheer, unadorned beauty of violence.<br /><br />2007 UPDATE TO REVIEW TO MY 2000 REVIEW: People can be properly disappointed with the second and third installments of The Matrix saga.  They didn't live up to the hype and expectation generated from the original.  Fair enough, but don't blame the original for the fact that the follow-through was so weak.  The Matrix is one of the classics of the sci-fi and action genres.
076792603X|5.0|Best book I have read in a while. I fits with much I have learned after many years of Biblical Research, Plus answers many other questions.
B00011RPB0|3.0|I love Bill Murray, particularly in one of my all-time favorites, \\"Groundhog Day\\" (quoted approvingly by Roger Ebert as \\"one of the most spiritual films of our times\\").  He does a great job, as does his opposite, Scarlett Johansson.  Sophie Coppola's direction was outstanding.  But the movie didn't *do* enough to capture the attention of my MTV-addled mind.  Yes, the characters were well-drawn and believable -- but to what end?
6301971272|5.0|I bought this for a film class I was taking because it had all the bonus features one could hope for.  The documentaries are great and include interviews with producers, actors, etc... from the movie.  Also, the film has been extended by about 16 minutes, the way Sergio Leone intended it to be seen!  I definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Leone or even to those who already have it on DVD but without the great extras.
B000VI70WM|5.0|Let's get serious for a second.  This is the most danceable, hooky, catchy album that they've had since 1986!!!   It's quite ironic that it took Timberlake and Timbaland to get DD back to their roots.  Finally, I can hear Simon's soaring vocals paired with Nick's hook-laden synth and John's brilliant bass.  \\"Tempted\\" is magnificent - what an amazing dance song.  It's simultaneously old Duran and new.  \\"She's too Much\\" is incredibly stylish (and complex, I might add).  Bryan Ferry would be proud.      This album is fresh, it is perfect, and this is exactly what we've all been waiting for since, well, Ronnie and Maggie were still in power.  Let's hope that radio stations and (good) dance clubs in LA, NY and London start playing this album!      Guys, I doff my hat to you.  What a splendid effort.
0307387178|2.0|This book is non-fiction, based on the true story of Chris McCandless who forsake his parents, his sister, and his promising life for the wilds of Alaska. And there, he perished. The book presents a rather romantic portrayal of a self-absorbed kid who thinks he is bigger than life. The book portrays Chris as a magnetic and larger than life figure who touches all that cross his path. There is the hippy couple who virtually adopts Chris, there is the old army vet who lost his son and wife in an accident while he was in Japan and now wants to legally adopt Chris, there is the midwest grain operator who employs Chris during the summer, and so on. Each of these people appears to be carrying a void that Chris fills; maybe it is Providence, maybe sheer luck, whatever. I did read the book, and I must say that it was boring at times (the author apparently sees a bit of himself in Chris, so we are treated to a couple of chapters on the existential angst of the author as he masters a mountain ascent and very nearly pays for it with his life.) I am sorry, but I do not empathize with Chris. Here is a kid who has the fortune of a good education, a reasonably stable family, and a bright future. But in his hubris, he decides that this is not good enough, and wanderlust is the answer to his imaginary problems. So he goes to Alaska to live alone in the wild. He dies, probably from eating poisonous roots and berries. It is telling that the last words he scrawls in the bus where his body was found were that a life in isolation was not worth living. Why did he force himself to pay such a dear price for that lesson?
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This is one of my new all time favourite films.  The first time I saw it, there was something that sort of hit me over the head but it was subtle.  I bought it on a whim and recently rewatched it, and fell in love with it.  Considering I just got out of the hospital near death, it was the right time to watch it, so the timing was perfect.  I absolutley loved the performances by Maggie Gygenhaal and Emma Thompson.  I think both of them did FANTASTIC jobs, they crafted their characters to the core and with heart.  I loved the whole eccentric withdrawn greasy writer thing Emma did.  And I loved the edgy passionate alternative angst thing Maggie did, down to all of her body movements and expressions.  I also loved the way \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" way filmed, all the colours they used brought about a serenity in me.  And lastly of course, the most important aspect of the film was the writing.  It is a brilliant, original smart script.  Thank you to the filmakers and everyone involved in making this movie.
0307120007|5.0|My children loved this book and are now 12,13, and 15 years old.  Now a 1year old niece is loving it.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Beggars Banquet, is a classic. Starting with Sympathy the stones best song this cd is a good blend of Rock, Blues and Country. No Expectations and Prodigalson are great country, Dear Doctor is good. Parachute Girl is a good Blues rock song good guitar. Jigsaw Puzzle is still relevent since modern life is like a puzzle with a couple of pieces missing. Stray Cat Blues has great guitar and a great vocal. Factory Girl is one of the stones best songs great violin and vocal. Salt of the Earth is better than the live version from Atlantic City (1989) Beggers Banquet is really that good. Oh Yeah!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band Of Brothers is an amazing portrayal of the events of WWII.  My husband is a veteran and cries everytime he watches it.  Every American should watch this series and be thankful for what our brave soldiers give for us and remember those who made the ultimate sacrafice.
1577312082|5.0|The best way to \\"get\\" this material is to both listen to the CD and read the book concurrently, they complement each other.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I will start this review by saying that I am a U.S. Servicemember who has been serving overseas for the past 7 years; as such, I have become what I call an \\"Amazon Junkie\\".  Amazon is my main source for purchasing items I want from the good ole U.S.A.  I give you that little background because I have literally purchased thousands of items from Amazon, this is the FIRST item I have ever written a review on.  Not only am I writing a review, I feel OBLIGATED to do so...This CD is that good!!!    I will not go into a song by song break down that I have seen in other reviews (great reviews by the way); instead I will tell you what I think may be some other useful information.  My main motivation for even looking at this CD was that I grew up a Crue fan and have been a little disappointed lately in what we have been offered.  I decided to give this CD a quick listen under the preview section.  The songs were definately enough to peak my interest so I made the purchase.  This is more than just a CD for the ears; it will have your imagination running wild.  I have been listening to this non-stop for the last 9 days and I can tell you it will be quite a while before it is ejected from my car CD player.  It is labeled as a \\"Soundtrack\\" and it is just that...It is a soundtrack from the book, but if you really listen to the music you will find yourself swept away on a journey of Nikki's life for the rough year he was addicted to drugs.  I can literally see this becoming a monster play or a movie similar to (but better than) The Wall or Tommy, The Rock Opera.  Yes, I put this CD up against legends like Pink Floyd and The Who.    Is this CD for everyone; not sure, but I sure as heck love it.  I listen mostly to Rock/Metal/Alternative; the sounds I am currently digging are:  Breaking Benjamin, Seether, Disturbed, Godsmack, Strata, Saliva, Shinedown etc....  If you dig those types of tunes; I promise you will enjoy this CD....Enjoy.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I assume that most of the reviewers here are adults. Why all the negative reviews? It's a kid's movie, for crying out loud. I'm an adult and find this movie to be very entertaining. It's a \\"cute \\" story. I ordered it on blu-ray and I expect it to be spectacular at 1080p. I'll be watching it with my nieces, nephews and godson.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Awesome DVD.  I have watched it over and over.  The lighting is good,  they are hitting all the notes, it is an outstanding performance.  It is obvious that they knew that that night was going to be a special  night. There is even some classic Joe Walsh humor injected in there.  Phenomenal DVD set, worth every cent!!!!
B000VLE3IS|4.0|This could have been so much more than what it is.  I was sorely disappointed when I opened it up and found that I had purchased merely a greatest hits package.  I thought I was getting something previously unavailable.  I wasn't sure what it was, as the packaging info on Amazon was amazingly inadequate, but I didn't think I was getting a greatest hits packaged with a dvd.  The DVD is great, it seems to be a collection of various performances, it's unclear.  Nonetheless, the videos are all much fun to watch.  Zeppelin is like Springsteen in that video just does not do them justice, but when video is all you have, well, it will suffice.    This product is packaged in a horrible cardboard set up.  The discs are difficult to remove without getting your fingers on the playing surface, and it's a bit over wrought.  The cover is awful.    The music is great, though.  Nothing like a little Led in your day!
1595141715|5.0|I didn't read the book all in one night, but not for lack of trying!  I had to got to sleep, but I rushed to finish it the next day.  Jay Asher does a great job of writing both the girl's point of view as Hannah narrates her story and from the guy's point of view as Clay listens to it.  The tension as you wait to find out what Clay could have done, caring for Hannah as he does, is almost unbearable.  We can feel Hannah lose contact with the world a bit at a time, until she is floating free and alone, and Clay's despair as he loses her all over again.  The other kids aren't completely evil (the worst is just plain uncaring), but they are totally self-involved, as are Hannah and Clay to a certain extent.    It's a great romance, up to a point, and a great illustration of how cruel teenagers can be.  It also shows how rumors spread, how people take  \\"permission\\" to treat other people badly from rumors, and how someone can slip from ordinary life to suicide mode without those around them noticing.  It's a very intense, sad, real, gripping book.  You're left, though, with hope that some of these kids will wake up and do something better with themselves.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|My favorite attribute of British Humor is its unpredictability, and so goes Shaun of the Dead.  A hilarious, mindless, non-thought provoking comedic journey.  Watch this movie, Don't waste your time with Hot Fuzz however.[[ASIN:B000RJO578 Hot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition)]]
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a movie for all ages.  So enjoyable and wonderful way to spend a few hours.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|A frightening glimpse of life behind the Iron Curtain.  Well acted, engaging tale of human strength and weakness, and the potential for excessive government intrusion into its citizens daily lives.  Anyone who romanticizes Socialist forms of government needs to watch this film and take it seriously.
0446577391|5.0|I've really enjoyed the Camel Club series and was waiting for this one to come out; and it was definitely worth the wait. The story and pacing were excellent, the characters stayed true to the first two stories and I couldn't put it down. A co-worker saw me reading it, asked about it, then went out and got the first two and then read mine. We both loved it, were a bit sad with the death of one of the main characters (I won't be too much of a spoiler here) and are waiting to see what Mr. Baldacci does with his ending. He left the back door open and I hope to see another book in this series, it's just a great way to spend a cold, quiet evening (or any other time for that matter) at home.
B0000009WC|5.0|Another of FZ's classic works released as a gold CD.  The dynamic range expansion offered by the gold is truly superior to any other form of recorded medium currently available.  The complexity of Zappa's music is perfect for this.  See also, [[ASIN:B0000009WB Apostrophe (')]]
B000VI70X6|2.0|I've been a Shakira fan for a little while and thought Live & Off The Record and Unplugged were great DVD's, that looked and sounded good. I was looking forward to this disk and have to admit that I'm terribly disappointed in the sound quality or total lack thereof. During La Tortura it became just that. The switching from Shakira sounding like she was overdubbing the song in a studio to Alejandro Sanz who actually sounded like he was at the concert was abysmal. There seemed to be a lot of overdubbing going on with this disk.     Don't get me wrong. If you simply want to see what the last Shakira tour looked like this is a great disk. If you are also hoping for great sound quality you will be greatly disappointed.
B000RJO578|1.0|For as much as I loved Shaun of the Dead[[ASIN:B000R8YC3G Shaun of the Dead [HD DVD]]], I loathed Hot Fuzz.  The sound mix was brutal, the story predictable, and the gags recycled.  Do watch SoD, skip Hot fuzz.
B000V801PK|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000CFXNQ Touch]][[ASIN:B0000CFXNR Be Yourself Tonight]][[ASIN:B0000CFXNT Savage]][[ASIN:B000089RVU Bare]][[ASIN:B000NVLJR4 American Doll Posse]]    This new cd by Annie Lennox is the most like her Eurythmics albums than anything she has ever done solo.  The upbeat \\"Ghost In My Machine\\" & angry \\"Love Is Blind\\" remind me of \\"I Need A Man\\" from Savage & \\"How Long\\" from We Too Are One.  The soulful \\"Womankind\\" reminds me of \\"Right By Your Side\\" from Touch and \\"Condition Soul\\" & \\"Its alright\\" from Be Yourself Tonight. \\"Sing\\" reminds me of \\"Sisters\\": from Be Yourself tonight.  Then there are a few songs like \\"Through The Glass Darkly\\" & \\"Big Sky\\" that remind me a bit of Kate Bush or Tori Amos.  The song \\"Smithereens\\" is my favorite track and is very Elton John like.  I love this cd!! If you liked Diva you might love \\"Im Lost\\" & \\"Fingernail Moon\\" as these two songs are strong ballads kinda like \\"The Gift\\" & \\"Stay\\" from Diva.  And \\"Dark Road\\" is a bit like 1000 Beautiful Things from Bare.  But for the most part this cd is like Eurythmics! I also like the bonus disc of goodies!! Long live Annie Lennox!!
0780619587|5.0|Great acting!  An amazing true story of overcoming mental adversity.  Uplifting and inspirational.
B0002S947K|3.0|If you just liked a couple of songs, this is not for you...
B00006EXDM|5.0|Ever wonder why these old guys are still kickin'?  Well listen up and wonder no more.  Here's the essential soul of one of the greatest rock bands of all time.  The DSD remaster really enhances some of their complexities that you couldn't appreciate on the original LP/CD (I have both).
B000MCIBB6|5.0|This is NOT somebody tampering with a classic. I put it in my car stereo and from the first drums fill on \\"Hello, I Love You\\" i could hear the clarity of the remix. It's still the same songs you've come to know and love so don't have a cow or anything. The only differences in the voclas aside from the clarity is that sometimes you hear Morrison scat-singing to himself during a solo or interlude of osme chatter in the studio. It's a classic rock album redefined with a clarity of modern day equipment. It doesn't sound like it was drowned in reverb like was the style so ofter in that era, but is actually clearer and more distinct and ultimately satisfying to the ear.<br />The different versions of \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" have a second slightly slower version in which the lyrics are almost read rather than sung and a third version excluding the guitar fills and, of course the long version \\"Celebration of The Lizard\\".
B0000009WB|5.0|If you're a Zappaphile you already have this.  If not, you need it.  This is probably the finest collection of musicians FZ ever assembled.  And coupled with Over-nite Sensation[[ASIN:B000OCXM0O Frank Zappa: Apostrophe / Over-Nite Sensation]] it represents some of his best work.  The Gold discs offer incredible sound reproduction.
B000OQF6N6|1.0|I won't try to paint the Smashing Pumpkins new album as \\"getting back to the Pumpkins sound\\".  It is what it is, a wall of noise for the sake of having noise.  Not one distinct song, the entire CD blends together into a mess of guitars with some inane lyrics mixed into it.  If this is the best a seven year layoff brings, maybe it should've been eight.
B0000009OP|5.0|Les Claypool described Mark Sandman as one of the most talented musicians he knew.  Listening to this album will likely bring you to the same opinion.  The sound is haunting, lyrical and very unique.  Sandman placed guitar strings on his bass in a variety of configurations and truly stretched the barriers of the instrument.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This movie has everything going for it - it is tragic, funny, true, and even  hopeful.<br /><br />It appears that a majority of Americans WANT a national health care system more like the rest of the Western world's.<br /><br />But here it is, election time, the very same year this shocker came out, and the candidates (at least all the ones with the money, i.e. the ones who might actually win) are pretending this film didn't happen. The Democrats (again, the ones who are likely to win on the strength of cash) are, at best, promising us a system of enforced health insurance purchase - with no guarantees that the insurance companies will be held to their end of the bargain.<br /><br />If I needed proof that government has ceased to represent ordinary citizens, this would be it.
B000QUCNOK|3.0|A unique story, very well acted with beautiful cinematography.  A little long though.  I was also a little underwhelmed with the ending, but I won't give that away here.
B000X3KZVI|1.0|I collect concert DVD's and I purchased this DVD for my collection. I could not wait to see it despite all bad reviews. I like Carey, but she is just not good in concert, this concert is very boring. There is nothing spectacular about it or even visual. She doesn't dance, she sings ok and the concert is more like a TV show (a boring one). The only nice thing about this concert was the lighting and its just good not spectacular. I expected more from her!! Save your money for something better, it's not worth it!
B000QUCNP4|4.0|Well acted, excellent story, great authenticity.  The movie spans 3 hours, but really keeps your attention.  It's only towards the end that you start to realize just how long it is.  If you enjoy true crime dramas, this really is an outstanding offering.
B00005JPNW|5.0|This epic fantasy film is fun and gorgeous. Visually and cinematographically stunning, this movie captures Lyra's Oxford breathtakingly. Furthermore, the CGI is superb. The characters are intriguing. Thee actors playing them are pitch perfect. The screenplay adaptation is sharp. The changes from the book are the right ones and even purists such a myself will be unperturbed by them. Overall, it's just such a great holiday movie. I'm really excited to see it again and will gladly spend my money on seeing it again.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|This 1961 film has long been regarded as one of the finest of Hollywood's huge historical epics, and it is certainly one of the most intelligent ones. It stands alongside BEN HUR and A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS as an example of history-as-entertainment. The age-old legend of the Spanish hero known as \\"El Cid\\" has come down to us in poems and plays, and this film presents us with the best distillation of fact and fiction drawn from those sources.     Director Anthony Mann assembled an impressive cast, gorgeous locations, and awesome battle scenes to tell the tale, but he and his colleagues did not forget the most important elements--a strong script and a touching, believable love story. Charlton Heston has never been more impressive than he is here, and Sophia Loren's Chimene is one of her finest roles. The two stars are perfect together, with able support from an A-list international cast. Add to this the stunning cinematography and Miklos Rozsa's majestic musical score, and you have a grand-scale, sweeping saga of love, valor and chivalry. EL CID is a feast for the eye and ear. Highly recommended.
B000K4WPCC|1.0|Touted as the new millenium's The Lost Boys, this movie is undeserving of such comparison. The soundtrack is smashing and the actors are all good-looking, but there is no witty dialogue or humorous subplots. The special effects are decent, but are more reminiscent of a high budget show (Heroes, The Dresden Files) than of a movie. About the best thing this movie has going for it is a one-line joke about Harry Potter.

B000P0J02E|5.0|I love this CD. My favorite track is Drink Up Me Hearties. At Wit's End is also one of my favorites especially from 4:00 to about 5:00.  Brethren's Court, I Don't Think Now Is The Best Time and One Day are also excellent. Enjoy
B000VWYNNW|4.0|The Zep remastered with extra tracks.  It does not get any better than that!
B000ZQ6UBW|5.0|What an amazing movie!  I saw this in the theatre, skeptical that a Jewish Resistance fighter would fall in love with the local SS head.  The movie developed the story so wonderfully that it runs so very smoothly.  You watch as she loses her family, begins to work for the dutch resistance and all that happens afterwards.  I have been eagerly waiting for the movie to be released!  Don't wait to see it!
B000VR824S|4.0|If you enjoy guitars, great guitarists, and great music, then you must have this collelction.  From John Mayer to B.B. King, this collection displays some of the best talent in comtemporary blues and country music ever dsiplayed.  having Steve winwood at the end is not bad either!
B000RMQH30|5.0|From beginning to end, I feel like this album is Ben's strongest in years. I love every single song equally for completely different reasons. There is so much variety here that I can listen to the album start to finish daily and not get tired of it. Songs that stood out initially to me were \\"Fool for a Lonesome Train\\", \\"Say You Will\\", \\"Fight Outta You\\" and \\"Needed You Tonight.\\" And even though these tracks stood out initially, all the tracks have grown on me to a point where I can't pick a favorite. For me personally, this is my favorite Ben Harper record since \\"The Will to Live.\\" Definitely check it out.
B000VWYJ86|2.0|It has some good action scenes. However, the movie is completely ruined for me because it contains big illogical holes. For example,  when Bourne and Nicky tried to evade the assasins, Bourne never wore disguises. The movie showed cameras in the malls, and in the streets recording movements of everybody. Nicky had to dye her hair to look different. Yet Bourne did nothing. He did not even wore sunglasses! And the CIA could not catch him!    In another scene, the local CIA chief, tried to save his life by making a run for another country after being found out he had leaked top secret information. While doing this, he's using the passport with his real name!  Yeah right! Please be reminded that he's a CIA local chief.     This kind of movie is good because it's thrilling and it's brainy. It makes you think. This movie insults your intelligence. I found the first installment was more thrilling.     This film's worth watching once.
0307346609|5.0|Here is the deal.  I purchased The Zombie Survival Guide and I liked it so much, I decided to buy this book.  At first, I thought I wouldn't like it.  I thought that having a book that recounts the events of the Zombie War through the first hand accounts of others wouldn't appeal to me.  I was expecting it to be through the eyes of the author.  Instead, I found myself entangled in each story, one after the other; as well as how they intertwine and form the separate aspects of the Zombie War, from beginning to end.  It was a refreshing read for me.  The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z were the first pieces of fiction I've read since high school over 15 years ago and they jumped started my interest in recreational reading again.  Five stars all the way, for this one and for The Zombie Survival Guide as well.  Hopefully, we will see more zombie antics from Max Brooks in the near future.

I was shocked at his defamation of Christians, making statements that if the Christian God existed he wished the worse for him.  While I feel there should be a separation between the writers words and the writers views, I feel his hatred of Christianity ultimately appears in his work... in a subtle way...

B000OZ2CZW|1.0|The state of today's \\"music\\" is pitiful! Rihanna and every other young girl/guy today SOUNDS ALIKE! It's a whiny, monotonous kind of sound with banal, kid-like lyrics being repeated over and over with a definite hip/hop beat that is truly annoying.    This stuff is being nominated for Grammy Awards!  For years, the Grammys have sworn that they nominate \\"the best\\" which is not based on record sales.  But, if you'll notice, all of the nominees are best sellers.  I cannot imagine \\"artists\\" like Rihanna, Justin Timerlake and Beyonce marching up to receive the highest HONOR music has to offer. Is THIS the BEST America has to offer?  It cheapens the award, reducing it to the same level as the Billboard and American Music Awards, which are honest about their awards being for sales only.The awful part is that artists with REAL singing talent sit at home watching this disaster, as one no-talent after another treks up to accept these awards.    What Happened To Great Music?  Will it ever return? How do we run these hip/hop phonies out of town!!!!!!??????

B00005JPKE|3.0|I heard many great reviews on the movie and even though I thought that Flags of Our Fathers was a bit slow, I hoped this would be different.  I found many glaring flaws with the movie that I found very distracting.  As someone else mentioned, there were 22,000 Japanese on that island and only 236 remained alive after the battle.  This number is absolutely staggering if you know anything about war.  Take the battle at Gettysburg for instance.  There were approximately 4,000 deaths and 40,000 casualties out of forces nearing 150,000 on both sides.  This is typical of a \\"regular\\" battle.  The number of deaths is actually extremely low compared to the total and only a fraction of those injured or otherwise incapacitated thus counting as a casualty.  So for the Japanese to have such loses is truly something amazing.<br /><br />They died in those numbers because they \\"fought\\" to the death.  The impression you got from this movie was that 90% of them commited suicide.  Or that for much of the battle, people stood around in caves with little to do except talk about their dire situation.  There is a story of one soldier who said that they were drinking their own urine after so many days without water and after a while they were urinating blood.  There was no real sense for the lack of supplies in this movie.<br /><br />I find it amazing that it has taken this long for America to make a movie from a perspective other than its own.  The British and Germans make movies that take into account the other person's perspectives. I remember reading one of Stephen Ambrose's books where he recalled a rather telling story.  He visited a British soldier to discuss the battle of Pegasus Bridge.  The officer told him that he should interview a good friend of his - who turned out to be a German officer that was present on the opposing side of that battle.  Ambrose thought that he had nothing to gain, nor would he interview a member of the \\"enemy\\" force.  Are you kidding me?  And he calls himself a historian?  Yet that is what I also tend to see with American movie makers and watchers.  To see a movie from the \\"other side\\" is to somehow be a traitor.  That is ridiculous.  There IS another side and it only helps to to understand the REALITY of the situation to see it, not just to see it from your own very limited view point.<br /><br />Thus on those grounds I think this movie is very important.n?

0743486285|5.0|The Heroin Diaries documents a year in the life of Motley Crue bassist and songwriter, Nikki Sixx. Most the book is the actual diary that Nikki kept in 1987. Besides the diary entries there are coments from former managers, former girlfriends, family and the rest of the Crue. The book gives fasinating insight to what drugs can do to a person, and of course it's always interesting to hear stories of Motley's parties. I basically read this because I am a fan, and I had already read both the Dirt, which I loved, and Tommyland. Motley Crue fans will probably enjoy it the most, but I think a lot of people that read The Heroin Diaries will find it interesting. I hardly read, and I couldn't put the thing down.

B00012QM8G|5.0|After re-viewing this masterpiece of filmaking recently, I wanted to add just a few comments about how well Spielberg's \\"Schindler's List\\" recreated the history of that time, and how his faithfullness to the story-telling adds to the enduring quality of this film.<br />All too often in movie-making it seems movie directors think they need to change the real story, embellish or twist the historical facts, in order to make a movie \\"entertaining\\" to modern-day viewers. But the Holocaust is a daunting task- how to artfully recreate an event in history that, had it not actually happened and the events been recorded for posterity, would be too unbelievable to ever occur to the wildest of human imaginations.<br />\\"Schindler's List\\" is a masterpiece of blending a compelling human story with the known facts, without any \\"Hollywood\\" revisions.<br />After reading several of the published books on Oskar Schindler's life, and the history of the concentration camp Plaszow ( faithfully recreated in the movie, even to the point of those scenes being filmed in a reconstructed \\"camp\\" very near the present-day location of the historical camp), I've been re-impressed with the movie, for it's faithfullness to history. Actual photographs of the real Kommandant Ammon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes in the film) exist showing him astride his white horse in the camp, standing on a balcony of his camp villa, casually brandishing a high-powered rifle....images that were almost exactly reproduced in the movie. An actual survivor of Plaszow who was on the movie set reportedly was even terrified by Ralph Fiennes, as he apparently so perfectly mimmicked the real Goeth. The depiction of numerous brutalities within the camp are also confirmed by eye-witness accounts of Plaszow survivors.<br />This is one movie, about an unthinkable historical event, that remains faithful to the facts, and lets the story tell itself.<br />And that story is timeless, and never to be forgotten.

It feels like a new gold age in Animation, good story, excelente animation, great music, and a very sweet ending, makes what i think is the best movie of the year (live action or animated)    The dvd is great, i loved the menu based on the credits animation (or creditouilles), The short Your friend the rat is hillarious, and the few extras are great.    Too bad it doesnt have any more features, since Cars, Pixar have decreased the number of extras on the DVD.    And this version doesnt have any spanish subtitles, which is bad because im latin.    But overall a great movie, and a new Classic.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|Watched the HD DVD version from the UK. I have to say it is nothing short of spectacular! The detail, amazing, the sound, enveloping, utilizing the TRUE HD format. Was not able to find any dirt or edge enhancements. Ridley did a great job restoring his vision; even some minor fixes and CGI throughout the movie. I highly recommend it for any Blade Runner fan...     Don't know about the Blu-ray version but suspect it will look just as good since the print is probably from the same master.      The 2nd disc DANGEROUS DAYS is not in HD only regular dvd. The disc runs almost 4 hours covering many of the production aspects of the movie. This set does not come with the extra 3 discs. Will have to wait for the US version on the 18th.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|My review concerns the theatrical version of Bourne Ultimatum.  This is a great series which is loosly based upon Ludlom's books.  There's plenty of action and the plots are pretty good.  When the first movie came out I read the 3 books by Ludlom and was amazed how much the plot of the first movie differed from the book.  By the second and third movie, there was virtually no relationship to Ludlom's storyline whatsoever.  There's 2 more books in the series (not written by Robert Ludlom) and I hope they don't make them into movies since they're not very good reading.  I heard that Ben Affleck turned down the Jason Bourne role -- Thank god!

080726203X|3.0|Rifkin does an excellent job as the narrator of this book. his vocal tone and reading style match the story very well.  the story itself has various logical problems that i found distracting. i cannot add much to what has already be written by over 3000 reviews.

Of all the albums that I've heard from this band this is one of the best,with classical moves and a sometimes \\"spooky\\" vibe that sets it apart from the symphonic-prog pack.

061891868X|4.0|This book is not a physics entertainment, feel good, kind of book, and here's why.   Lee Smolin has tried to accurately portray the troubling issues within the field of physics these days.  The physics community as a whole has seemed to have lost it's ethics or standards by which something should be promoted or studied.  This is probably due to the fact that the hiring practices in the physics community is unethical, and so people with any real ethics, and a true vision, are weeded out.   The main example given in his book for an idea that has been way over promoted, is string theory.  String theory -(as brought out in his book on page 352) is a theory that makes no predictions and therefore not cannot be subject to being disproved by any experiment, but nor can it be proven either. However, as stated even earlier in his book, string theory is not even a complete theory, but only a conjecture based on conjectures, that it may eventually someday contain a complete theory somewhere in all of those calculations. More probably not however.    Does he just complain?  No.   Professor Smolin does have the vision to at least be able to tell us in what direction we should be looking in, for a furtherance of progress.  We should be asking more questions about the foundational concepts of physics.  No, not all of foundational issues have been solved, just ignored.   There are several assumptions about gravity, light, relativity, and quantum mechanics that have not yet been completely verified.  We are indeed missing something very crucial that would allow us to make another leap forward in our understanding of the laws of our universe.  This book covers these issues in detail, but it appears that the only people involved in trying to solve these worthwhile endeavors, have for the most part been put to the side by the physics community as a whole.   If we are wrong about, or don't fully understand the foundational concepts of our physics, then how can we feel that our current conjectures are sound?  If the foundation is weak and incomplete, then the rest of the house is no good.  If even just some of the questions regarding our foundational issues could be solved, then a seer could put some understanding to it.  Do I think that the next great leap in our understanding of the laws of the universe, will answer all 5 of the great problems that Smolin has alluded too in theoretical physics?  No, but it may help answer one or two of them.  We're still a long long ways off from understanding how things were made, and no doubt more questions will arise to fill in for any that are eventually answered.     I give Smolin an \\"A\\" for effort, and an \\"A\\" for his candidness.  String theory get's an \\"F\\", and so does the academic community.  If you want the truth about string theory, and an insight into what we should be exploring in physics, then you should read this book.
B0006ZE7G2|2.0|I loved this movie in the theaters and on my VHS copy...that's got to be said up front.    Now I sold my VHS copy and bought this thing.....,the picture is great,BUT I don't have any surround sound system capability.So let me warn any buyers that DON'T have a 5.1 system that THIS DVD HAS NO STEREO MIX option.    This means that when I play it most of the film has almost no audible soundtrack,...until the music comes in loud.  Then it almost blows the speakers on my TV set.  This must be because most of the quiet sounds are set to play from the rear speakers (that I DON'T have),and the LOUD sounds just flare up past the level of endurance.    I am sick over the fact that I sold my perfectly good VHS copy of this,especially since this version of the film is almost unbearable to listen to and watch on a stereo set.  I think that the manufacturers of this disc are very unsympathetic to us non-5.1 endowed fans of this clasic rock movie. There should be a sound setting for us \\"stereo\\" TV owners.    Just pass this by if you don't have surround sound.

B000002SE0|5.0|This remains the supreme reference in \\"Turandot\\" recordings.  Molinari-Pradelli's direction is imperious and tender in exactly the right proportion and, together with the brilliant cast, M-P manages to render a virtually cinematic image of Puccini's Orientalist fantasy -- in this regard it is unequalled.  Mehta's later recording comes close, but with a cast that, for all its vocal brilliance (not least the astonishing contribution of Joan Sutherland as Turandot), cannot match the superb, mercurial performances on the EMI set.  This set is the aural equivalent of the great postwar Italian director Luchino Visconti's opulent and visceral cinematic wonders, \\"Senso\\" and \\"The Leopard,\\" and the cast belongs to the generation of great Puccini singers that could be thought to know exactly what the idea of cinematic opera might mean -- this is especially true of the Calaf and the Liu on this set.  Franco Corelli is simply the the most gorgeous, sensual, and heartbreaking Calaf on record, and Renata Scotto's Liu is fully his equal -- she is unsurpassed in the role. Just listen to the finale of Act 1 (\\"Non piangere, Liu\\") and you will hear (see?) what I mean. Nilsson's Turandot is even more dangerous and imperious here than on the earlier RCA set recorded a few years earlier, with a vocally impeccable but far less viscerally involved cast (Tebaldi and Bjoerling).  But the emotional heart and trauma of this opera lie in the relation between Calaf and Liu, and this recording understands this.

Even The Clash's terrible \\"Rude Boy\\" movie had an option on the DVD menu whereby you could just watch the great live scenes. Maybe they'll trot the fantasy-less version out next Christmas...!
B00005JPFH|3.0|This is the worst of the Spiderman movies. The problem is you have to deal with 3 villians (Sandman, Venom and the Green Goblin) as well as Spiderman and Peter Parker. Each villian as well as Peter Parker and Spiderman requires their story to be developed and side characters Gwen Stacey and photographer Brock need thier share of time as well as the Battle Royal. This is too much for a 2 hr 20 min. film. No one person really gets the time they need in the spotlight. I especially didn't like the way Gwen Stacey was treated. She became just a tool that was used by Peter to get at Mary Jane. She was never this in the comics, she was his first girlfriend that died tragically. Another problem was the Sandman was too powerful, the only reason that Spiderman was able to survive was the Sandman let him.<br />  The first movie was what I expected, a well-done story of his origin and a battle with one of his greatest foes. I'd give it five stars. The second was better, it gave Doc Ock a humanity that was never in the books. That was taking the timespan of the movie and using it well.

B000003CMD|5.0|Motorcycle accidents. First, Duane. Then, one year and thirteen days later (and two songs into this album), Berry.<br /><br />Nearly everybody knows that Duane Allman was the undisputed captain, guiding force and spiritual leader of The Allman Brothers Band. But not too many know that when Duane was killed, it was Berry Oakley that took over the role as leader, organizer and decision maker. When both were suddenly killed in motorcycle accidents, the brotherhood was shell-shocked and confused, but determined to go on. Brothers And Sisters (1973) is the album they made and (like Eat A Peach) \\"dedicated to a Brother\\".<br /><br />The songs appear on the album in the same order as they were recorded. Berry plays bass on the first two, Wasted Words and Ramblin' Man, and both are outstanding. Wasted Words shows off Dickey Betts' slide guitar skills, and it's obvious he had been taking some lessons from Duane, or at least paying close attention. Gregg's swaggering vocal performance is on the mark here, too. Ramblin' Man is a classic, a popular fan favorite and the band's most successful hit single. Dickey's lead guitar solos are smoking, and it's a fun and lively vehicle for a country rocking guitar romp. Dickey said he was inspired to write the song by Hank Williams' 1951 song of the same name.<br /><br />Come And Go Blues, the first song recorded without Berry Oakley (who was replaced by bassist and Vietnam veteran Lamar Williams), is a winner, too, and it features an inspired vocal performance from Gregg. Southbound is an energetic ABB classic, with Dickey and Chuck Leavell, the band's new prominent piano player, providing some great solos, and Gregg doing a good job singing the Dickey Betts written lyrics.<br /><br />Dickey's instrumental, Jessica (named for his daughter), is the album's centerpiece, and a fabulous piece of music. It's sort of a Southern rock meets Western swing meets Jazz masterpiece that is a joyful and engergetic exercise in musical excellence. Chuck's piano solos are spectacular, and Dickey's guitar work on Jessica is some of the best in his career as one of the finest guitarists of his generation.<br /><br />Jelly Jelly is a slow blues that never really finds it's groove, but does have moments. The last song on the album is Dickey's country blues, Pony Boy, which features some spiffy slide work on an acoustic National steel guitar. It's a bouncy and amusing little tune, and wraps things up in a way that's true to the spirit of the album.<br /><br />Brothers And Sisters is one hell of an album, really. It's not on the same level as Eat A Peach, Live At Fillmore East, Idlewild South, or their self-titled debut, but nothing else they have ever done is either. There are plenty of great moments on the album, and lots of excellent musicianship.<br /><br />The autumnal album cover features photos of Butch Trucks' son, Russell (front cover), and Berry Oakley's daughter, Brittany (back cover). The inside cover features a photo the band and their families on the Allman Brothers Band's farm in Georgia. The photos all effectively embody the family-oriented and optimistic spirit of Brothers And Sisters...and brothers and sisters., and Dickey's guitar work on Jessica is some of the best in his career as one of the finest guitarists of his generation.

0525950079|4.0|When four children meet in the forest to practice shooting the arrows made by one of them, Merthin, none can imagine the way their lives will intersect over the years. After a solemn promise to a wounded knight, Merthin honors the confidence and remains forever enamored of Caris, who encounters many obstacles in determining her future, many the result of her inordinate intelligence in a world that gives short shrift to women; Ralph fulfills his destiny as a man of action rather than logic, successfully brutalizing those who stand between him and his impulses; Gwenda, the poorest and least likely to achieve, is trapped in her heritage, a peasant with simple dreams, none of which comes easily or without tremendous personal cost.<br /><br />Using characters in the same manner at Edward Rutherfurd (Dublin, The Princes of Ireland, The Rebels of Ireland), the four animate the plot in 14th century Kingsbridge, all activities revolving around the priory of Kingsbridge Cathedral and the petty jealousies of the priors and noblemen who are restricted only by opportunity. Greedy and ambitious, the nobles anticipate war with France to fill their coffers; meanwhile the priory, under the stewardship of Godwyn, Caris' cousin, remains steadfast in its small-minded, tight-fisted hold on power, limiting the growth of the city, the prior surrounding himself with sycophants, turning a blind eye to the demands of the future.<br /><br />Follett defines the logjam of God vs. progress in the conflict between priory and growing city. As long as the Church retains the final decision, local politics will be determined by religious influence; it will not be until the reign of Henry VIII that the status quo is significantly challenged.  It is no surprise that by the reign of Richard III, brother of Edward IV, the peasants and townspeople welcome the sweeping changes to existing laws, citizens long inured to suffering at the hands of noblemen who govern their lives and livelihoods. Meanwhile Kingsbridge endures wars and embraces trade opportunities, defeated at every turn by a prior unable to govern without the comfort of personal grievances. It remains to Caris, in all her incarnations, and Merthin, who must make his fortune elsewhere before earning the respect of the Guild, to push for change, time and again running afoul of Prior Godwyn and his right-hand man, Philomen.<br /><br />With over a thousand pages, this novel is filled with the mendacity of small men who seek only personal aggrandizement, the prosperity of Kingsbridge ever in thrall to ambition married to limited imagination. The story is often ponderous rather than driven, the weight of an intransigent prior burdening the tale with the inevitability of failure; yet Follett's sequel to Pillars of the Earth does illuminate the petty governance and grinding bureaucracy that inevitably metes out injustice to the powerless. Bad luck dogs certain characters, the predictable defeats frequently tedious, as well as an endless contretemps between Merthin and Caris. In the end, Death is the great leveler of every injustice, striking with a deft hand and with impunity.

Lawrence: [contemptuously] Why don't you take a picture?<br /><br />or<br /><br />Sherif Ali: Have you no fear, English?<br />T.E. Lawrence: My fear is my concern.<br /><br />Not particularly \\"realistic\\" perhaps, but such great theater!

0812550706|4.0|In Enders Game, Ender is an outcast because he is what they call a \\"3rd\\". The story begins with Ender getting his monitor taken out, which causes a state of paranoia. Not only is he looked down upon because he is a 3rd but also because he was not chosen to go to the space academy. But what Ender does not know is that he actually was chosen. The story follows his journey through the school and a twisted plot which pushes him be the best he can be at the expense of every last thing he cares for.    Enders Game was a surprising twist to that of my normal reading genera. Neither space based novels nor movies have ever once tweaked my interests. However after hearing countless claims from teachers and students with their love for the book, I picked it up and was not able to put it down until I was on the last page. The story line being intriguing and all, I found the ending very displeasing and predictable. Luckily Orson dose not leave out any details in the book that would leave you guessing, allowing for at least some enjoyment at the end. The surprising character development of being a helpless child to a strong leader was well played out. You will find yourself feeling the hardships that ender is put through, and even feel joy when he is triumphant. I was even surprised to learn the development of Ender's siblings without him and there ability to make a difference even though they are kids (these chapters were my least favorite.) Another surprising aspect of novel is how Orson gives a very realistic curve on the children's intelligence as they come of age. This book, however, is only a gateway to most of Orson Scott Card's works. He luckily takes things more in depth with his Ender's world in other novels from countless views of other characters, and even an older Ender. This is definitely a great book to read if you are at all into fiction novels. If you have already read this great novel and loved it ( I know someone who reads it every year in the spring), a greatnext book to read is \\"Ender's Shadow\\" which follows the character named bean before and after \\"Enders Game\\"
B000OLGCI4|1.0|Great looking restoration, vibrant colours, great stereo sound, some worthy bonus features on a second disc... But the movie, clearly conceived and designed for fullframe viewing -no matter how Disney released it theatrically- is here ruthlessly cropped at the top and the bottom to fill the widescreen tv, loosing picture information. Some sequences look particularly bad. Is this a Platinum edition? No way.
B000VI04HK|3.0|The 2 live cd's sound quality is good as is the quality of the DVD. My question is, why cant REM just put their best songs on ventures such as this?  They continue to try to dazzle us with B sides that didnt quite make it the first time around.  That being said, both the DVD and CD's are of good quality, just wish the song selection was better.     Sasquatch
B000OONTFU|4.0|The reason for buying my hd dvd player was this pack, the image cuality is awesome but the only desapointing point is that the animatrix DOESN'T come on HD.    Really i expected a little more because of the title \\"ULTIMATE MATRIX COLLECTION\\" but it's a good choice.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|Another great movie finally gets what it deserve  s on DVD and this one is a winner. Apart from the great film ifself, this second DVD has loads to watch if you're a real fan of movies like myself.    A pity it took so long, but you wont regret it!!
0143038419|1.0|I wonder exactly what the time of prayer taught this woman as she immediately came out of her \\"prayer\\" to resume a completely average (of meat and men) life where she basically promotes her book on TV, what a crock
0440418569|5.0|Lord Asriel is forming an army to face a foe that has not yet been stood up to named \\"The Authority.\\" Because of his forceful destruction between the fragile balance between his own world and others, there have been plenty of new changes among the worlds. These changes cause many unbalances which will cause unlikely situations happening among very different people. Will and Lyra are separated, and there even becomes more complications with the Subtle Knife (a tool that will uses to cut windows into other worlds) There will be new friendships made, and even more unfortunate unveiled but the girl with the Golden compass is the only one who is fit to show the proper path.    With the release of Hollywood's version of the first book in the series The Golden Compass, I was overwhelmed to finally finish this breathtaking tale. \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is a must read anyone interested in fantasy novels. There have been many harsh words about the series because of its \\"Standing up to the church and Authority.\\" I find these comments from my friends very displeasing because they have not even read a page of the book. The story clearly plays out what the church is doing, and how it has become corrupt. (Abducting children for experiments to just name one) There is many other things to take in hand about the series, and how it takes place in a different world quiet parallel then our own, and its quite crazy to get up and hands over a novel. I completely did not mind reading the tale for just being a tale, with its heart warming storyline and characters. With the creative mind of Pullman you will be swerved off into a complicated twist, leading you to follow very different characters who all come together at the end in a fantastic clash that you will remember for weeks to come. Pullman has a wonderful imagination that will have you picturing creatures from other worlds and on the edge of your seat with excitement. The plot has blown me away with not only predictable outcomes,but with twists that kept the reader guessing till the last page. The character progression of the story is extremely strong. Pullman does not disappoint with an excellent. Job portraying human nature, be it with love, or hate. The trilogy will stay close to my heart and will be reread again in the future. There is however only one problem I have with the book. When I read it I found that I would become highly interested in one character, and be displeased to turn the page into another chapter that would take up the progress of another character. This was only displeasing, but at least gave me something to look forward to in future chapters. The Amber Spyglass sits up on my top 10 book list, and will probably stay there for years to come.
B000002OOY|5.0|I honestly can't find the right words to describe how amazing this score is. The movie itself has been a long time favorite of mine since I saw it in theaters, and it still has a certain magic to it. John Williams's music adds to it in volumes.    From the beautiful and stirring main theme that captures the grandure of  the dinosaurs brought back to life, to the excitment of \\"Welcome to Jurassic Park theme\\" that stirs up the mystery for the listener, this score is as top-notch as the special effects used to bring the dinosaurs back.     The only John Williams theme that I can think is more beuatiful than that for Jurassic Park is the \\"Theme From Shindler's List.\\"
B000VDDDY6|4.0|This is my first time watching Star Trek TOS and I'm glad to see it first in HD. I love Star Trek, and this is a great season. However, I give this package three stars, not the four stars above.    Even though the case looks fancy, it isn't practical. Spock would have been disappointed. It takes up too much space, doesn't look good next to other HD DVDs, and requires too many steps in order to access a disc:     1. Open the plastic case  2. Take out the yellow box  3. Slide out the discs holder, being careful not to touch the first disc  4. Select your disc using the convenient, book-like discs holder  5. Put the discs holder back in the yellow box to protect it from dust  6. Carefully place the box back in the case and close it (optional)    Second,I don't like the HD DVD/DVD combo feature because all it does is raise the price of the HD DVD. I shouldn't have to pay extra for the feature I'm not going to use. It also means the discs won't have nice cover art, which would be a much easier to identify them.    Third, a booklet would have been much more convenient to tell you the episodes in each disc than a bunch of plastic slides. The plastic slides are annoying to slide them back in the case. There are five cumbersome pieces, which can make it difficult to handle.    Fourth, this second order, which replaced the damaged first order, is also slightly damaged and defective. I just can't seem to get a good one.    Despite the package, the content and image quality is great with few exceptions. Some of the new CGI scenes look a too clean for the rest of the episode, which contains grain. During the intro, Kirk's voice sounds much lower than the orchestra. I still don't understand why the intro is missing the Soprano, which is talked about in the special features. The menu's are a pain to navigate on the HD DVD side because you can't view all the choices at once. The DVD side is better, but why.    It's obvious this is a rushed product.
B000NA28I4|4.0|This a good movie. It has a good backstory with a D&D prestige class.<br />Though it isn't a D&D type movie, players will enjoy it just the same.

B000KRNCYY|5.0|I would rate this at 10 stars, the music is great and it is so enjoyable, I don't think I will ever quit playing it!

My rating on a scale of one to ten would be no lower than a 100!!!!!
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|I had this, originally, on vinyl, then, later, I bought the CD of 1990. That CD always impressed me with its incredible drum sounds. I bought this because it was remastered & had three bonus cuts.    This was the first Top album I ever bought & I now consider it to be second only to Eliminator. This album was the one that broke Z Z Top into the public with \\"La Grange\\", \\"Waitin' For the Bus\\" & \\"Jesus Just Left Chicago\\" which are still some of my favorite Top songs. \\"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\\" is an excellent album cut. Normally, Rhino does an excellent job on the remastering process but, here, I found the drums to be somewhat subdued. So, I have mixed feelings on that regard. The three bonus cuts are all live versions of the three best known songs from this album. That's okay, but it's no great shakes in my book. After more than thirty years I still enjoy listening to this album.
B000NVIGC0|2.0|I've been a fan of Wilco for years and, as of this point, own all of their albums. I've seen them in concert once (and greatly enjoyed their show.) So I will feeling a great deal of anticipation for their album. Unfortunately, I came out gravely disappointed. It is not like the songs on the album are, bad per se. Its just that they are deeply, intensely boring. I have trouble getting myself to work up the desire to listen to them, particularly when I still have access to A Ghost is Born, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and Summer Teeth. I miss the old, experimental Wilco and hope that there next album is a return to form, rather than the boring snoozefest that is Sky Blue Sky.
B000BJ7BCK|3.0|My main reason for having purchased this was two of the cast members. - Bruce C and Kurt R.<br />It's a good movie for family. - Would've preferred there to be more of a battle sequence within the city, but it worked out quite well all in all.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|Desperate for this to be region free. Previously Amazon listed this as Region 0, now it's listed as Region 1 (US and Canada only  = Region A for Blu-Ray). AFAIK all Warner Blu Ray releases to date have been region free. Can anyone confirm this? I've checked here:[...]  and it appears to be region free. Will check with Amazon and post back if they reply.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|This is a creative and imaginative movie which demonstrates that visually arresting movies can be made without recourse to shoot 'em ups. This is a beautiful film, both in terms of sound and images.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|I finally decided to buy this because, apparently, Warner Brothers is reticent about releasing Maverick in its entirety on DVD. C'mon Warner, this audience isn't getting any younger; the longer you wait only decreases the potential number of customers willing to buy this!    That being said, I'll talk about what's on this disc. It has three episodes & they are among the best episodes of Maverick. The three episodes are \\"Shady Deal at Sunny Acres\\", \\"Pappy\\" & \\"Gun-Shy\\". There are probably another 20 to 25 episodes of Maverick that are just as good as these. The only one I felt shouldn't have been here is \\"Shady Deal...\\" because it includes all the semi-regulars in small roles that are assisting Maverick in the con. Unless you're a big fan of Maverick & have seen most (or all) the episodes, this cast of semi-regulars doesn't come across with the same impact because you don't know of their previous history with the Maverick brothers. So, the inside joke of this cast is lost upon any viewer that's not familiar with the other shows. The three episodes featured here include the humor & satirical bite of the traditional Maverick episodes. These are indicative episodes of Maverick, representing the entire series. These elements are well showcased & these are the things that made Maverick so popular in its day as well as making it standout among all the more traditional Westerns of the fifties.    If you're a fan of Maverick I would highly recommend buying this single DVD issue. But, hey Warner Brothers, what's the deal; get off your can & release this stuff! What's the matter? You think James Garner is going to sue you again? Pay him the money he deserves (or thinks he deserves) so we can get this stuff.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|It has been a long time since I was scared of writing a review, but this is one of those cases. This film is extraordinary, and therefore, I fear not being able to convey the extent of its qualities. Having said that, this is not a movie for everyone, since it develops at a slow pace and, in the typical fashion of Scandinavian movies, spends quite a bit of time contemplating the faces of the actors, in order to allow the viewer to understand their emotions. However, unless the pace is something that really bothers you, this is a movie that you cannot afford to miss.<br /><br />Jacob is working in India helping homeless children, and in an effort to secure funds for his quest, sees himself forced to travel back home, to Denmark, to meet with the CEO of an important corporation. Upon his arrival, he meets this affable family man, Jorgen, who promptly asks him to stay over the weekend and attend his daughter's wedding. When Jacob sees Jorgen's wife, he realizes that he already knows her, and when a speech by the bride reveals unsettling information, things get complicated really fast. After that, emotions rise to the surface and we witness one of the most beautiful and moving stories I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />This film not only has a wonderful plot as a backbone, but also counts with an astounding cast, all of whom play their roles to perfection, and excellent cinematography. The use of the cameras, especially with close-ups of the eyes when emotional scenes are developing, works perfectly. As if this was not enough, the little I know about Scandinavian culture was proficiently presented. I attended a friend's wedding in Sweden earlier this year and I was amazed at how similar this was to what they showed in the movie. I have always been a fan of Scandinavian productions, but this film is at a higher level than most. Simply brilliant!
B000R7HY0K|3.0|My feelings about this movie are mixed.  There were looooooong stretches of pointless (and frankly boring) dialogue.  When the girls are in the car or sitting around the table, for example.  To me those scenes were weakest.  The girls were really supposed to know each other.  But a lot of times, they talked as if they were introducing themselves to each other.  It just wasn't very convincing so it tended to drag in those spots.  There were bright spots though.  Near the end it got exciting when the tables were turned.  And I liked the stylishness of it.
B0000009OP|4.0|this is a great album. just put it in and let it play. don't try to read into it too rushedly. let it ease over you...wind through your noodle. sophisticated articulation is not the only form of poetry to be enjoyed. words are sometimes simply words...things to do with our mouths while trying to get across a message. it's the whole package, not just a carved out pieces, that creates the movement... good stuff.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I love everything about this series. The imagery is breathtaking (provided its seen in High Definition). I really appreciate the great lengths the filmmakers went to making an \\"A\\" class production. Although this package  does not have Sigourney Weaver as the narrator (original on television), it is still a great series to own.
B00000294R|5.0|I had to take time out to write a review for this album. Big L is one of my favorite rappers. He was highly underrated in my opinion and his flow was sick. Very few rappers could touch his flow and delivery and he was truly in a class by himself. His lyrics were stinging, dark, complex and he was a master with metaphors. As far as this album goes, some might say that this one is not as well produced as his second album - Big Picture. Which is excellent too by the way. I own both. I still feel this album is a classic. The beats are raw and underground and L paints a dark picture of the seedy, grimy life of a street hood. This ain't the bubblegum pretty boy rap of Chingy or Nelly. There ain't no happy endings in Big L's world. This is pure, uncut lyrical hell and L told nothing but the truth on this album. Lifestyles Of The Poor And Dangerous should be in any true hip hop head's collection. Songs of notable mention - Danger Zone, Fed Up With The Bulls**t, Graveyard - ill early verse by Jay-Z, All Black and Street Struck. Also if you can, check out a song called Devil's Son. Another sick, demented early song from Big L. It was actually released as a promo by Columbia Records and was supposed to be on this album but was cut because its content was too explicit. One listen and you'll see why but it was a great song. It was also L's first solo single. Also check out the two mixtapes by J-Love to hear that song and some unreleased Big L songs. They're just as good as his album songs. If you're new to Big L this is the best album to start with. If you just love real hip hop, own it. The whole album is a hip hop classic. Buy It. You need this in your life.  R.I.P. Big L
0812565886|3.0|Overall, Persuasion was not bad, but I would have enjoyed it more with some plot adjustments.    I felt like I was never well acquainted with the object of Anne Elliot's affection, Captain Wentworth.  Although Austen described why Wentworth was such a good man, I did not participate much in Anne's love for him (although I did empathize with her feelings).  There were great moments and good characters, but there could have been so much more in the relationship between Anne and Frederick Wentworth.      Also, I was disappointed that the the end was summarized in narration.  The climax of the story pertaining to the romance and to the foes of the family, though starting out well, ended too soon in narration rather than dramatic action.
0440238609|1.0|Children are impressionable and in my opinion shouldn't read stories in which the plot revolves around the supreme blasphemy, namely, that God is a liar and a mortal. I believe it is not appropriate for children to read books in which the heroine is the product of adultery and murder priests act as professional hit men, torturers and authorize occult experimentation on young children an ex-nun engages in occult practices and promiscuous behavior, and speaks of it openly with a 12-year-old couple and the angels who rebel against God are good, while those who fight on God's side are evil. This is wrong. And while it's been softened in the movie -- or at least that's what Hollywood is telling us -- it's still there in the books.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|When this film was announced over a year ago, the chuckles and jokes(If I had a nickel for every friggin' time someone said \\"what, is he gonna fight in a wheelchair?\\", I'd buy a yacht) began.  After all, the Rocky series was being poked fun at back at #4.  Stallone was obviously well aware of how people would react to the concept of another Rocky film on the surface, and wrote his script accordingly.  The people in the film feel the same way about Rocky as the folks in the real world who laughed the movie off.  It is great screenwriting on Stallone's part and made people and critics think twice about the movie.  This turned out to be a damn good movie, and most folks agree.  The movie is done as if Parts 3, 4, and 5 didn't exist.  You could almost look at it as the true Rocky 3.  There are really no references to the other films, at least none that would make a difference.  It seems as though Stallone wanted to really get back to the roots of the story and get back in touch with the character.  Over the course of the sequels(parts 3 and 4 specifically), he seemed to have lost touch with the character a bit.  As Rocky became more famous and wealthy, he also suddenly spoke more intelligently(he pretty much spoke the way Stallone did in all of his 80s action films), and became a bit more high brow.  Rocky's always been a lovable, generous guy with a big heart, but a little punchy and loopy, and in this film Rocky seems to have his personality back.  On the other hand, you can still assume the events of the sequels happened as well, coz there really is nothing to contradict that they happened.  Here we see Rocky living alone, wandering the neighborhood, wondering what happened to everything he loved.  His wife, Adrian has passed on and he simply can't get over it.  His son sees him more as a bother than anything and only seems to talk to him out of necessity.  Even the folks who all once glorified him as a hero just seem to regard him with little enthusiasm.  He's just a relic in the sports world.  It's all kinda depressing actually, especially a sequence where he drags his brother in-law, Paulie, along with him to revisit locations where he and Adrian used to frequent, while he reminisces about their times together.  He also owns a restaurant and that seems to be the only joy he has.  He does befriend a woman(the girl on the street corner he gives a pep talk to in the original Rocky film) and her son, and they become good friends.  Not romantic, but the potential is there.  When a computer generated fight putting Rocky(in the prime of his career) against the current world champion shows Rocky kicking the champ's butt, opportunity knocks.  The champ(Antonio Tarver, who had to beef up to play a heavyweight fighter) doesn't like the embarrassment.  He also has personal demons of his own.  His managers and the boxing promoters see this as a goldmine opportunity and soon they're knocking on Rocky's door.  Rocky's been bored for so long and has nothing to lose, so he decides to do it.  What the hell, right?  Plus, Rocky sees it as a way to feel like somebody again whether he wins or loses, as long as he goes the distance, does his best, and can prove to everybody that he's not some old fogey that is just gonna get knocked on his butt in the second round.  In a way, it's alot like the first film in that regard, that he really has nothing to lose and is doing it more to prove something to himself rather than everyone else.  The fight is visually probably the best and most realistic of the series with the first few minutes looking as though you're actually watching a Pay Per View bout.  Pretty cool.  How does it turn out?  Watch it!  Stallone definitely scored a knockout with this one.  Very good.t a relic in the sports world.

0312340958|5.0|I thought that this book was very honest, while at the same time providing a captivating and enticing read. I have read many of Karen Armstrong's later books on religion; however, I read this wanting to know more about her past life as a nun. The book details her seven years in a religious order in which she endures the pains of pre-Vatican Council II styled religious life. On the outside world, to which she was oblivious, things such as the sexual revolution and the Vietnam war were occurring. I could identify with some of her stumbling blocks to cultivating a spiritual life, including emotional and intellectual barriers. I now have the deepest respect for such a profound woman, not only in her writing ability but also in her courage and willingness to be so transparent in telling her story. This is a wonderful autobiography.
0385733577|1.0|This \\"book\\" reads like something that belongs on the Sunday comics page directly between Prince Valiant and Zits.  The author exhibits a sesnibility for ancient history about as deep and lasting as newsprint.  The iPod-cellphone-gizmo crew will swallow it down with everything else that's a half-nanometer thick and pass on to the next thing.  ANYONE with a genuine affection and empathy for alchemy, for Flamel, for Dee and for the ancient deities will be wincing every alternate paragraph.  DO NOT give it to a teenager you care about: they are better off with candid misinterpretations of ancient wisdom rather than this masquerade.  Ugh!
140120306X|3.0|When you're anticipating a work from Alan Moore you expect to be floored, but like any anticipation the thoughts before can muck up the final product. Low and behold the Black Dossier is that mucked up follow up.    While adventurous and sometimes great, the story here is less epic in nature, and it takes 2 of the more human characters of the league and takes them on a little adventure. If you're a capes comic reader you should probably steer away from this, also if you're expecting invisible man and Mr. Hyde you won't get that.    Instead this work reads like a good detective novel, with the heroes escaping with the dossier and are on the run from authorities who want it back. In between their exploits the heroes read some of the dossier, and you're privileged to their pages as well.  While very dense and sometimes long, these sections breath life into the book and make it more epic in nature.    But you won't be seeing any grand vistas of beauty in the art, no giant aliens like in the second trade paperback or as adventurous as the first. Instead you'll get 3d glasses, some rockets flying by, an an interesting look at a character who lives forever and changes their sex every 100 years or so.    Get this only if you're a big fan of the league or alan moore, but if you're a casual reader i'd pick up something a little less novel-esque.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Great picture - amazing sound! Why the complaints??? Okay, you did not actually BUY the deluxe version...oh, okay, now I understand.  I did BUY the deluxe version and it is worth every penny! Guy Massey did  a superb job on the sound. More presence. More bass. More bongos. The video has many several things not visible in the original video tape (VHS) or DVD (Yep - I own BOTH!).  PLEASE - stop the bitching...this is a quality piece - from the DVDs to the books to the packaging. If you BOUGHT IT - you luv it, don'cha!?!?!?!? (Minor complaint - YES - the dvds WILL fall out. Okay, you know that now...BUT the POSITIVES WAY outweigh the negatives. Even the Royal House of Hanover had the will - to ENJOY!
0446691437|4.0|Filled with lots of truths and no  fluff, a fast (2 hour) read. Very informative about the subject of resistance. The main message is-do your art.      There is one part I didn't agree with, suggesting that cancer patients are responsible for their own illness.  There is no science included to back up this theory, so the author goes out on a big limb here.  I know some people have  survived cancer, but their alive to talk about it. Dead people are not around to talk ...... about how they loved their life, were living to their fullest, were at peace and loved doing their art.  We all are going to die of something eventually, so can we do this without the blame?

0393327655|3.0|\\"The End of Faith\\" is not so much that as it is \\"Harris Wishes It Was The End Of The Faithful.\\"  Lest you think me an alarmist, Harris states in his own words, \\"Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them.\\"  Big Brother and Minority Report have come full circle...and then some.    Harris is actually a fairly interesting writer, with an occasional humorous barb where I found myself laughing.  This tome was started on September 12, 2001 and is, primarily, a rebuttal to the belief system that led to the terror attacks on America.  As with the other major anti-theistic writers of today, he is convinced that our problem isn't merely Islam, but any expression of faith itself.  His views on Christianity are somewhat more moderated than Hitchens...at least Harris does not take the extreme position of doubting the historicity of Jesus.    The book slowed for me in the last two chapters as Harris took a philosophical turn that reminded me a lot of Buddhism.  Apparently, I was not alone; the Afterward reveals that he took some flack from his fellow atheists for embracing too much Buddhism.  I guess a little faith is even good for the faithless.    As seems normal, unfortunately, for this genre, Harris exhibits an almost infantile understanding of biblical Christianity.  Whether he intends to do so or not, he responds only to stereotypes rather than genuine theological constructs.  This serves only to weaken his overall case.
0375842381|5.0|I purchased this box set only after seeing the movie trailer. I had recalled reading Golden Compass years before, and I remembered it was good, but decided to read it over since I couldn't recall what it was about.     Utter Brilliance. Philip Pullman manages to create a world unlike any other using a mixture of both fantasy and science. Being a scientist myself, I could relate a lot with the alternate realities and although the concept of daemons was confusing at first, he explained the complicated idea of it so well that I believe he should get a notable mention for just that. If you are the type of person who hates slow paced books, than I can guarantee you will not be bored with this one. Looking back at the trilogy now, the only \\"slow\\" parts in the entire series took place in the Golden Compass first four chapters. After that, Pullman has us moving ahead at an astonishing paces, juggling between various intertwined plot lines at once. I sometimes found myself having an adrenaline rush keeping track of it all, making me feel much more for Lyra since she had so many things to take care of in such little time.     I don't really see why C.S. Lewis's books are compared to Pullmans. I don't believe they have anything in common. Lewis does create his own world like Pullman did, but Pullman seemed much more epic to me with a much more complicated storyline, while Lewis just goes straight ahead towards the goal. There was just so much going on here that I was not at all suprised with the way he split the narratives in The Amber Spyglass. Pullman is also darker than Lewis is, and presents much more character development. We see Lyra go from a child to an adult in such a short time dealing with a very complicated world and adultlike situations.    For those concerned with the religious aspects of the books, I myself am a religious person but this did not stop me from enjoying his books; instead I think it made the experience even better. Pullman is constantly challengingthe norms in His Dark Materials, not only the magisterium. It's just the idea that not everything is perfect, and you see this within the characters a lot since there is no clear cut line between what side who is on. If you are really a staunch Christian why don't you give it a go: you really might be surprised at how good it is. I myself recommend these books to both children and adults alike- they contain so many different uses of language and themes that both sides can appreciate it. Pullman makes a lot of implications that younger children cannot understand but adults will see immediately. So, even if you read it as a child- read it again, you might be surprised.     Pullman did not bore me even once in his books. I was intrigued throughout all of it, and at this I was very glad I purchased the hardcover copies since I gave it to my younger siblings to read as well. It was so amazing that my brother (who never reads anything in his life) finished it in one go. A must read for everyone, fantasy lovers or not (I'm not).
1401322336|5.0|Jamie hits the nail on the head when he says he is worried about the state of mass food production. The amount of toxins we put into our bodies due to eating fast and over processed food is staggering. Oliver wants us to keep personal cooking traditions alive and purchasing this book is a step in the right direction. His never pretentious approach to the kitchen makes everything seem simple and relaxed. Recipes like Honeycomb Cannelloni, Fifteen Chocolate Brownies and Pork Chops with Apple and Sage are inventive without demanding ridiculous ingredients. A fantastic addition to any kitchen library!

In a dystopian future androids are used by humans, and look so similar sophisticated tests have to be used to be able to tell them apart, based on functions that they are not able to perform - having children, etc.    Humans don't allow them rights, and some of the robot people variety rebel at this - which gives people like Deckard a job, tracking down these rogues.

1594489505|5.0|I should say that after reading Hosseini's \\"The Kite Runner\\", I was a little skeptical that his second book would even come close to his debut, but I've been proven wrong. More than being a well-written novel of two Afghan women whose paths cross and merge, it is also a simplified historical document of Afghanistan's politics and culture - which is rich, but tangled in religious fundamentalism, which naturally gives birth to sexism, xenophobia, and many other biases that make life difficult for everybody...robbing dreams and livelihoods away from otherwise capable citizens.     The story line is very realistic, and the reader easily acknowledges that the characters in this book were not merely made to fit a foreplanned storyline. This is a book I wouldn't hesitate to purchase.     I would dub Hosseini a true story teller without a flinch. A must read!
B000TGJ80S|4.0|Coppola focuses on the heartbreak and romance of Dracula in this appealing rendition of Stoker's classic tale. The ever professional Gary Oldman as the beleaguered and lovelorn blood guzzler is the best performance in the film. Overall it's worth the watch for vampire film aficionados. The Good - Oldman, The Bad - Winona's accent, The Ugly - Keanu Reeves' accent, and its like he's not even trying!
075640407X|4.0|Supernerd alchemist problems.      This might be the best written tedious fantasy book that I have come across for a while.    Right from the part where he says that it will take three days to recount his story to the guy that wants to write it down you know that there will be more books, and given 3 days, likely a trilogy, and that probably not a lot is going to happen given it took 50 or so pages to get around to that point, even.    One sort of magician guy and his demon mate hanging out in his pub in the middle of nowhere, not doing much until some magical nasty beasts turn up, and people start getting hurt, then the Chronicler guy rocks up.    When he starts telling his tale, it seems he is basically supersmart, likes music, and has a flair for the stage.  A classic geek, and no sign of a football anywhere in his background, but plenty of makeup and sewing.  So, naturally he is hopeless with the girls.    His family runs a travelling theatre show, and when they pick up an educated man one day the boy, Kvothe, starts learning rather rapidly.    Then things go wrong, and it seems that some legendary bad people may be real.    Throughout, the story stops for framing interludes back in the pub to drop more hints about his part.    Apart from stuff-all happening until near the end in this Smartarse Boy at University part of the story, the author's writing seems to carry you along happily enough that you generally don't notice the story stretching.    Could be a case of last book first would be more interesting for this lot.    4 out of 5

B000BKJ78U|5.0|I say one of the best because there are other sci-fi franchises, such as Star Trek, that have made their indelible impression upon the genre as well. Yes, the first Star Trek movies would never have been as \\"cool\\" without effects that were created by Industrial Light and Magic, but the characters had been around longer than Luke, Solo and Leia. To argue which is the best is, shall we say, futile...suffice to say that the first three Star Wars films (IV, V, VI) are a must have for any sci-fi DVD collection and if you haven't seen them yet, well...you must not be breathing!
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Richard Attenborough's epic film of the life of the man whose policy of active passive resistance against the British helped lead India to gain its independence is a big epic in the grand tradition, beautifully crafted and stands alone in his canon as a director in that it has a genuine sense of vision.     Aside from its beautifully framed Scope composition, it is full of striking visual moments from waves of protesters passively lining up to be beaten in a 'raid' on a salt factory to the shot of the solitary Gandhi standing at the well in Amritsar after a massacre there. The crowd scenes are plentiful and truly massive and on a scale we are unlikely to ever see again, yet the focus is always on the man and what he stood for. Much of the credit for this goes to John Briley's excellent screenplay. Well constructed and filled with memorable scenes, it condenses an extraordinary life with clarity and pace and avoiding the pitiful cliche of Chaplin.     Kingsley's performance is one of the miracles of epic cinema, a performance large enough to hold its own against thousands of extras but layered enough to make Gandhi a credibly human figure. This gives the film the real sense of a journey through Gandhi's life, from his initial vanity and failures as a public speaker to a man who became the spiritual leader of his country with charisma, wisdom and wit. A not entirely uncritical portrait, there are inconvenient aspects of his life that are glossed over, but as an inspirational epic it has few equals.     Of the top-billed cast Candice Bergen never really registers, Trevor Howard and John Mills are hardly there long enough to notice with only Edward Fox, in one of his last restrained performances, John Gielgud and Martin Sheen standing out. The really impressive work is to be found further down the credits; Ian Charleson's missionary, Roshan Seth's Neru and a well-chosen roster of well-known faces in supporting roles. And for once these really are supporting roles, adding to the portrait of the central character rather than detracting from it with scene-stealing.     Despite the critical backlash it suffered (not helped by Kingsley's recent, significantly less than humble behavior), it is an impressive, sometimes moving film that was worth the price of admission in the cinema and is worth adding to your collection. All passion seemingly spent, Attenborough wouldn't make another halfway decent film until Shadowlands more than a decade later, but Gandhi is something of a masterpiece.
B00004RFFS|4.0|Ah yes, who could forget back when Cruise still had integrity and Brad was just a sparkle in everyone's eye? There were many who frowned upon Tom as the devilishly debonair Lestat, the vampire you love to hate and hate to love; but Cruise managed to pull it off in grand style. While the movie strays rather far from the book, watching Cruise and Pitt on the big screen as lusty blood suckers is a delight. The Good - the \\"buddy\\" chemistry between principal actors, The Bad - Straying too far from the original work, The Ugly - dancing with corpses - eeeew!
B00003CX97|5.0|\\"Take a good look, Clifton. One day the war will be over. And I hope that the people who use this bridge in years to come will remember how it was built and who built it - not a gang of slaves, but soldiers, British soldiers, Clifton, even in captivity.\\"     Still one of David Lean's very best films despite its faults, unlike most of his epics, the plot of The Bridge on the River Kwai is focused enough to allow the film its debate on the nature of heroism and command without seeming forced, and is divided clearly into two halves. The first is a battle of wills between two madmen and their respective codes of honour; the British Colonel Nicholson, who seeks to turn defeat into victory, and the Japanese Colonel Saito, whose cruelty comes from his inability to see his lack of shame over their surrender.     Nicholson is so determined to use the building of the bridge as a weapon against his Japanese captors to rebuild his troops' morale that he is blind to the strategic consequences (\\"I hope these Japanese appreciate what we're doing for them.\\" mutters Donald's medical officer). As Nicholson exceeds his requirements, he assumes Saito's role, even to the point of forcing officers and those on the sick list to work - the very points they had earlier clashed over - forcing the Japanese Colonel to face a surrender of his own. Ultimately reduced to the meek voice of acquiescence at one of their conferences, he alone achieves his objective but only at the cost of his self-respect. He alone realises what he has become.     The second half is more standard adventure fare, as anti-heroic escaped prisoner Holden (his casting clearly based on his similar role in Stalag 17) is press-ganged into returning to the bridge with gung-ho masochist Jack Hawkins to blow it up. If at the camp Donald is the voice of common sense, Holden is the voice of the common man. Faced with the wounded Hawkins' self-sacrificing heroics, he responds with a tirade against everything he stands for; (\\"Withyou it's one thing or the other, destroy the bridge or destroy yourself!\\"). But though he rejects the insanity of heroic codes and proclaims that the only true dignity lies in survival, he dies upholding just such an ideal. This is just one of the contradictions of an undeniably problematic ending, which opts for the spectacular at the cost of much of the substance of the film.     In reality, the bridge was never destroyed, but Lean discards history to give the audience the large explosion they've been waiting for. Depicted with intriguing ambiguity as to Guinness' motives, it nonetheless tends to obliterate the assertion of Pierre Boulle's novel that all the suffering has been in vain by allowing a victory, albeit at hideous cost. War is no longer a pointless and vainglorious farce played with human lives, but a place where even a cynic and an unwitting collaborator can redeem themselves through the nobility of self-sacrifice.     Yet if ultimately the film lacks the commitment of Bryan Forbes astonishly bleak King Rat or even Spielberg's dark Empire of the Sun, there is still much to admire, not least a quartet of great performances from Guinness and the under-appreciated Holden, Hawkins and Hayakawa. Lean is much more in control of his narrative than when he started making love stories with casts of thousands, his masterful use of the Scope frame coming over particularly well in this restored version (no new footage but a cleaned-up print) which finally gives blacklisted writers Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman their screen credits.

0805079831|5.0|This powerful in-depth treatment of the role economics play in shaping our world challenges the reader to \\"pay attention\\" to a subject too often ignored or treated as irrelevant. During the past three decades our political leaders have believed that capitalism should function unfettered from any government restraints [trusting in the \\"natural goodness\\" of capitalists] and that government should refrain from any program other than national defense.  Naomi Klein reveals how such an approach has supported the harsh government of a Pinochet and of the dismanteling of any U.S. program that is charged with regulating the excesses of commerce.  A scary book -  but one that should be read as we prepare for the 2008 elections.

0452286751|5.0|THE FOUNTAINHEAD was my first exposure to Ayn Rand and her objectivist ideas.  I'm surprised how much I enjoyed it.  This novel is brimming with Rand's philosophy, but also presents a very compelling story about a man (the brilliant architect Howard Roark) who refuses to compromise his integrity against all odds.  For the most part, this book is a real page turner.<br /><br />This type of novel isn't for everyone.  The writing is dry in spots, and much of the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic.  But I do really admire Rand's ambition here.  In THE FOUNTAINHEAD, she tries to convey a lot of big and demanding ideas that are normally not expressed by the mainstream media, or by most of the artistic community.  This book, in many ways, is one of a kind.<br /><br />Although I don't agree with all of Ayn Rand's philosophy, I still found myself looking at society in new and different ways after finishing this book.  So this is the type of novel that can change your world view.  And even if it doesn't, it's an interesting experience that you won't forget.  I heartily recommend THE FOUNTAINHEAD to those interested in being challenged as well as entertained.

0141439580|5.0|Emma is Jane Austen's penultimate novel. It is a long but engaging story of Emma Woodhouse who lives in the fictional village of Highbury 16 miles from London. The novel is in many ways a \\"bildungsroman\\" as Emma changes and matures to win her man and a place in literary lovers' hearts.<br />The major players in this Jane Austen classic are:<br />Emma Woodhouse-Emma is the spoiled daughter of widower Woodhouse. She loves playing matchmaker to young couples resulting in disastrous results!<br />Emma is flawed but lovable and good hearted.<br />Mr. Woodhouse-One of Austen's most hilarious characters. Mr. Woodhouse is a foolish nincimpoop always worried about the temperature and catching a cold. He does not want Emma to marry since he prefers she stay home and take care of his fussbudget needs. He reminds this reviewer of a character who could have fit in well in a Dickens novel.<br />Mr. Knightley. This wealthy landowner has been in love with Emma since she was 13. One of the charms of this comedy of manners is the conversation he engages in with Emma. He is a wise man and good judge of moral character. Emma foolishly thinks the merchant's daughter Harriet is in love with him. His name says it all for he is a knight in shining armor!<br />Harriet Smith-Emma seeks to mate her with the odious Rev. Mr. Elton but her plans go awry with he weds the foolish Mrs. Augusta Elton. Harriet is an innocent young lady who wrongly allows Emma to advice her on matters of the heart. She will later wed the mundane farmer Robert Martin.<br />Frank Churchill; He is the son of Mr. Weston a local landowner. Weston had married Ms. Taylor who had been the maid at Emma's home for 18 years.<br />Frank is a charmer with a weak character. Emma is briefly infatuated by him but learns his true nature from the faithful Mr. Knightley. He is anything but frank in explaining his past amours to Emma and Harriet.<br />Jane Fairfax is a lovely lass who has been secretly engaged to Frank Churchill. As the novel ends this pair wed. Jane is lovely but strikes this reviewer has lacking mental strength!<br />Miss Bates-A minor character who has the gift of gab! She rattles on with<br />little thought in several of the novel's chapters. I see her as an early form in English fiction of stream of consciousness monologue later mastered by such masters as James Joyce and William Faulkner.<br />  Emma is usually rated alongside \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as one of the two best novels written by Jane Austen. I enjoyed it immensely but note that there is a lot of talking and not much action. Austen liked to take a few country families and discuss a love affair or two in her narrowly focused works.

B000VUFJ3C|4.0|The boy bands were on the brink of extinction in 2001, so like most 14-year-old girls I moved on to a different breed of boy bands. (Ones with guitars.) Then BSB came back with Never Gone. Fast forward 2 years later and they grace us with Unbreakable. Okay so the sound has changed a little, Kevin isn't even in this album, and love and (mainly) heartbreak is a neverending theme. As much as I love BSB, they weren't as up with the times lyrically as I had hoped, but I can't help but still be amazed by their vocals being just as phenomenal without Kevin. My only regret is had I known there were 2 bonus tracks, I wouldn't have gotten the one with just 14 songs. And here's another shocker, JC Chasez (Yes, NSYNC) contributed his writing skills to the album. Who knew? I think this will appeal more to the truest of BSB fans (and those sick of hearing Britney.) and you gotta admit, it's interesting that even though they did get the memo that boy bands are dead, they don't care. Nick Carter (still a hottie!) has said that as long as music exists, so will they. They really are living up to the new title. Whoo-hoo!    Fave Tracks:  Inconsolable: Love the piano on this track  Something I Already Know: Inconsolable's twin, I know.  Helpless When She Smiles: I predict this will be seranaded by hopeless romantics everywhere.  Any Other Way- Love the guitar riffs! Awesome track.  Panic- The most upbeat track. Love it!  Unmistakable- Most beautiful ballad.  Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon- Somber yet beautifully written and sung.
068485743X|5.0|There are many valuable nuggets of information contained in this book - if you can disregard the title's misnomer and accept the author's consistent use of the impersonal 'he' and 'his.'  As other reviewers have noted, the book is written for those who already have a fair amount of text written. What you can expect is a helpful discussion on avoiding common pitfalls that many writers are inclined to make.<br /><br />The chapters on Dialogue I found quite useful. He outlines a number of amateurish mistakes to avoid in the use of dialogue and, through examples, provides reasonable solutions to fixing each kind of problem. Other sections I really liked were: Showing vs. Telling, Pacing and Progression, Subtlety, Adjectives and Adverbs, and Sound. He advises READ YOUR WORK ALOUD!! This is an invaluable suggestion. When you do, listen to the rythym, the cadence, the word choice. If it doesn't SOUND right, work on it until it does. As in another of the author's books, \\"The Plot Thickens,\\" Lukeman provides useful exercises at the end of each chapter to further help you overcome each problem area he outlines. This is an excellent reference for all novelists.

Not Brad Bird's best work, but nothing to be ashamed of.
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|Sicko was a well-made film, and definitely brought about a well-deserved attack on the health insurance system in America.  I've struggled with my PPO for ages, so a lot of this material was nothing new to me.  It was just as real and just an unfortunate.  Some of it did seem a tad exaggerated: I mean, a guy sewing up his own skin?  Give me a break.<br /><br />And granted, things are improved with free health care in France and Canada, but did Moore really give us the full story?  Can all people really afford this system?  And what about alternative measures of health?  Can a French person see an alternative practicioner of health, such as a chiropractor, or acupuncturist, as many times as they want without any limitations kicking in?<br /><br />Sicko had some humorous moments, but mostly it just seems to revel in how terrible our own system is, so the film is not always a comfortable watch.  But there is some good material here, and I'm glad he took on this topic.
032147404X|4.0|This book has one photo \\"hint\\" or recommendation per page. If you are a pro or very serious amateur in digital photography you will get little out of the book. Hence it may be of only a one or two star value. If you are an intermediate photographer you have probably heard much (if not most) of what is in the book. Hence it may only be a three star value. If one is only a novice to digital photography this book has plenty of good advice. Hence for that group it would be a four to five star value. It someone has intermediate to serious film experience (but not digital), the book will provide some useful advice (i.e., equipment, equipment costs, characteristics of digital vs. film) but 3/4 of \\"hints\\" are regarding general photo technique (i.e., dawn and dusk best time to photograph landscapes, etc.) and this group should know most of this. Hence for these people this book would have a two to three star value. One minor weakness in the book is that the author spends too much time attempting to be humorous (and mostly fails). His attempts at humor expand the book size by a good 20%. He should reduce humor and save reader's valuable time as well as some trees.

B00000AOUD|5.0|Thick As A Brick is an epic, willfully overblown and gleefully bombastic satire of progressive rock that, somehow, is a also a brilliant prog rock album in and of itself. It's a single LP-length song, crammed with elements of English folk and Yes-esque keyboard explorations, with rocking guitar-heavy passages smashing headlong into strange soundscapes and deranged jigs before spiraling off into grandiose instrumental improvisations, all of which serves as a background for a set off impressionistically immature, inscrutable, and seemingly stream-of-consciousness lyrics (which, according to the fake and nearly full-length parochial newspaper that serves as the album's cover, are based on a controversial epic poem by a twelve-year-old prodigy named Gerald Bostock). Now, I ask you, who but Jethro Tull could pull that off? The album works (and brilliantly so) because it revels in its own pretensions, celebrating prog's more bombastic impulses while sending them up, using the opportunity to throw a few well-honed and wonderfully cynical (if somewhat abstract) lyrical jabs at the artistic elite (as well as the rest of mainstream society), and managing to be a hell of a good time in and of itself. It's a brain-bending musical journey that just goes to show, you don't need to take things too seriously in order to make a grand statement. Classic!

B00007G1ZC|5.0|There is a reason why this film has only four \\"one-star\\" ratings here (and, as those posts reveal, those viewers were \\"unprepared\\" for the work). Now, I assume if you are looking at this page you either have an interest in Japanese-studies or a curiosity about international film: both are preferable, but either will do. Still, those studying/involved with environmental-science may appreciate this work more than either!      When I first considered purchasing the film, I was seeking a break-down of the eight vignettes, since I did not locate any while skimming here, I thought potential viewers might appreciate one (even if it is just a more current version) (Warning: there is a breakdown at wiki, but it contains spoilers for each segment and does not thoroughly address cultural issues ... best to read it after watching the film):    ---    1.) \\"Sunshine Through the Rain\\"  -A young boy is cautioned against exploring the forest on a rainy day. Legend indicates that foxes have their weddings in such weather - and they must not be observed by humans. The warning goes unheeded ...  -There is virtually no dialogue in this segment. Instead, the sounds of both nature (rain and insects) and traditional Japanese music tell the story. It is both rich in color and beautifully shot. This segment is based on Kurosawa's own childhood memories.     2.) \\"The Peach Orchard\\"  -The glistening raindrops of \\"Shineshine through the Rain,\\" we are brought to the floating peach-petals of this vignette ...   -Background: On March 3rd of every year Hinamatsuri (\\"Dolls Festival\\") takes place. \\"Dolls\\" donning traditional Heian-period court attire are arranged on a red-draped, multi-tiered display (if you are interested, Google the name of the celebration to understanding the tiering system). On this day, one prays for the happiness of girls (there is also a \\"Boys Festival\\" on March 5th). March 3rd is also dubbed \\"Momo No Sekku\\" (or \\"Peach Festival\\") ...  and here is where the story begins.  -A young boy is serving his sister and her friends on Hinamatsuri. He brings the girls seven refreshments ... but there are only six girls. He insists that his count was correct and leaves the room confused. The seventh girl appears and lures him into a barren area which was formerly a peach grove. There he encounters the \\"Dolls\\" incarnate (note: the grove is divided into tiers like the display previously seen in the boy's home).   -The story stresses the destruction of the environment ... but a colorful spark of hope concludes this segment. Again, dialogue is restricted to only what is needed and traditional music accents this touching piece.      3.) \\"The Blizzard\\"  -From the soft peach-petals of the last piece, we are brought to the cruel snowflakes of \\"The Blizzard\\" ...  -A team of mountain explorers have lost base-camp. They are frost-bitten, mentally despondent, and very near death. All but one member of the team is resigned to death. The one tenacious climber is visited by Yuki-onna who tries to lull him into a wintery-grave.   -Sound is at an absolute minimum here. The metallic clunk of the climbers' gear and the their labored breathing is all the viewer hears for several minutes. This creates a stark, foreboding atmosphere. A well-shot, uncanny segment.    4.) \\"The Tunnel\\"  -The first of three nightmares, this segment features a guilt-stricken commander who was captured as a prisoner of war and then released. His entire platoon was \\"annihilated.\\" He remains the sole survivor. The commander ventures through a dark tunnel. When he reaches the other side, he is \\"confronted\\" by his dead comrades (\\"confronted\\" is a bit strong since they offer no threat).     5.) \\"Crows\\"  -An all-star effort! \\"Industrial Light and Magic\\" helped bring this unusual vignette to life. Additionally, renowned director Martin Scorsese portrays Van Gogh (I would have never recognized him had the credits not listed him!!)    -At a Van Gogh exhibit, a man enters the artist's work. He seeks VanGogh  in a French landscape ... looking for answers to his most pressing questions. A visual masterpiece.    6.) \\"Mount Fuji in Red\\"  -A heaven of crows turns into a sky of radioactive clouds in \\"Mount Fuji in Red\\" ...  -The second nightmare. Mayhem ensues as it appears Fuji will erupt. Immediately, it is revealed that Fiji is not active ... but the nuclear power-plant behind Fuji has exploded. Purple, red, and yellow clouds of toxic death push Japan's residents to the shore. Where does one go when an entire island is doomed to a painful demise?     7.) \\"The Weeping Demon\\"  -A plague of radioactive clouds turns into sweeping dust in \\"The Weeping Demon\\" ...  -The final nightmare. After the nuclear fallout, little remains. A lone survivor searches for hope. But, the landscape is devoid of life ... save giant dandelions and a horned demon.   -A most pointed exploration of humanity's follies.     8.) \\"Village of the Watermills\\"  -As I hoped, Kurosawa leaves the viewers with a portrait of untainted nature. A man spies a village unspoiled by technology. A clear creek, flanked by wildflowers and frolicking children catches the attention of this traveler. He enters the village an learns about living in harmony with nature and the beauty of the \\"cycle of life.\\"     ---    While some find this work \\"heavy-handed\\" and improbable, it is crucial to understand this film as allegory. Moreover, I noticed a few complaints of recurring actors (that it hindered \\"suspension of disbelief\\" or some such nonsense) ... this is purposeful. These vignettes are interconnected and allegedly based on Kurosawa's actual dreams. Therefore, repetition would be \\"logical.\\"     With just a little patience and a little intellectual curiosity, you will find this a film worthy of your time ... and, hopefully, inspirational. Highly recommended.
B000W00Y0Y|4.0|What can I say?    The picture quality is better than any other concert I have seen on blu-ray.    Shooting on 35mm film was definately the right choice.  There is something about film and the way it captures the lights.  The colors are all highly saturated and the detail is amazing.  You can see the dust and finger prints on the monitors, the uneven texture on the surface of Brian's guitar and all the little details in Roger's drum kit.  I have never seen a more beautiful concert video; and to think this was shot 25 years ago.    The sound is excellent too.  But I found myself switching back and fourth between surround and stereo a number of times.  The surround soundtrack provided a very open and spacious sound; but it was a little too reverberant.  I found the stereo soundtrack to be more clear and direct.    Musically the band is in great form.  Freddie's vocal performance is top-notch.  He is in full voice and clear as a bell.    The reason's I only gave this DVD 4 stars are minor.  Even though Queen were at their peak in popularity when they filmed this performance, in my opinion this was not their artistic peak.  If only they could have filmed a performance 5 or so years earlier during their Night at the Opera and Day at the Races period.  Also, even though the band sounded great, it seemed like their performance was somewhat lackluster.  Compared to some of their other concert videos, this outing was not quite up to par.

What I got was a B+ double disc that could have been a \\"fabulous\\" A+ single disc, if they would have cut some of the filler songs. Sometimes, more is not always better. The songs that are good, are really, really good and the songs that are not, are um, NOT!  So if you use your handy SKIP button, you'll enjoy it more.  One thing is for certain, the more you listen to it, the more you like it.  After a few more listens, maybe I'll up my rating.  ( :
6303314015|5.0|The Movie Lion King is a great movie for children of all ages to watch. The movie is based on how a young lion Simba (played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is prince of the \\"Pride Lands\\", Simba can't wait till be king. One day his uncle Scar misleads him into going to the most dangerous place in the \\"Pride Lands\\". Later on his father gets killed and Scar (played by Jeremy Irons) blames Simba of killing Mufasa (played by James Eark Jones). Simba runs away because he thinks it is better that way. While he is trying to find his perfect place, he runs into a Warthog Pumba (played by Ernie Sabella) and a Meerkat Timon (played by Nathan Lane). The two animals help raise him until Simba is older (Adult Simba played by Mathew Broderick). Simba then runs into a old friend Nala (younger Nala played by Niketa Calame and Adult Nala played by Moira Kelly). Nala has tried to tell Simba they need him back to \\"Pride Lands\\".  I approve this movie to be watched by children of all ages.    Thank you for reading my review.    Rebecca H.

0780020685|5.0|After more than 50 years that this groundbreaking film was made, there is hardly anything to add. Here is my recommendation in gist:<br /><br />A MUST for an action movie. Without any special effect the photography is a master work and delightful to watch.<br />Little long... you may find initial part little slow. But it opens the plot - which is very simple - in a lucid manner.<br />Countless movie has been made taking inspiration and material from this movie. An all time great work.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|It is a great LCD mount for its surprising low price. It works OK.<br />But horizontal joint in the end of second arm is not that horizontal, resulting that every time you move the LCD, it will bring some vertical rotation too. So every time you move it, you will not only choose the position, but also readjusted it. Though the adjustment is easy, it is somehow annoying.<br />After all, this arm work pretty good, though not prefect. At least I like it.
B00005JPLW|2.0|There was so much hype about this movie. I simply could not get into it.  I was able to follow the storyline without any problems, but it simply did not interest me.  I guess... Women are from Venus and Men are from Mars.

I read it and decided to try vegetarian cooking.  My husband balked, at first, then he read this book and started buying soy milk.  He also tried veggie burgers and decided they're not so bad.  I have purchased at least three copies of this book because I keep giving them away to friends.  I have lost 60 pounds on a nearly vegetarian diet (with Weight Watchers) and this book helps me on the motivation end, to keep eating healthier foods.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I was hesitant about Nightwish with a new vocalist, but the voices and music are as good as ever, if not better.  The Poet and the Pendulum is an orchestrated piece of passion, though Amaranth and Eva are beautiful, as well.  Any fan of Nightwish will want this CD, and anyone interested in glorious, passionate music with a drive will not be able to resist.  Long live Nightwish!

0240808452|5.0|I have hundreds of books on drawing and dozens about how to draw the human figure. By far this is the best book I have on my shelves. As a live model teacher, I always recommend Force to my students who want to pursue carreers as illustrators, animators or to those who simply want to study the figure. The book is easy to follow and the concepts taught really change your vision about the human figure. Please note: this is not a book about how to finish your drawings, it is about how you should begin them. And, as the title of the book says, how to imput Force on your figures. If you really study this book, really following it and making the exercises, I'm sure, no matter how skilled you are, your drawing skills will improve a lot. This book is a must, alongwith any Bridgeman's book and Henry Yan's Figure Drawing. I highly recommend it both to begginers and experienced artists. I'd give six stars if I could.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|I saw this live at the Met and then waded through a storm to see an encore broadcast in a movie theater in Times Square.  Read the other reviews for the details--all I'll say is, people, it was every bit as ravishing as that, and more.
B000VI70WM|5.0|I had no clue that Duran Duran had a new album coming out until I read a review here in the Orlando Weekly.  The Weekly surprisingly said that Red Carpet Massacre may be one of Duran Duran's important albums.  That made me curious to pick up the album which I did.  I was such a big fan of the Astronaut album because it was such a refreshing sound to hear something new from the original members.  That album was filled with catchy melodies and grooves.      I listened to the first track of \\"The Valley\\" with the first couple of bars of a drum machine and a basic synth.  My first thought was \\"Aww man Timberland and Danja are dumbing down their sound.  But then the next layer of guitar with vocals brought it home to that Duran Duran sound as the next layer of harmonies comes in and then more synth sound is layered.  As the layers keep becoming added, the track consumes you and brings you up to date of a modern, current Duran Duran.  As the song moves along, you hear more of the band come in with more synth sounds.  Very futuristic sounding.  Now, being a big DD fan in the 80's listening to Rio and Seven and the Ragged Tiger, if back in 1983 then wondering what Duran Duran would sound like in the year 2007....I would really believe that this album is accurate to what the band should sound like in this century.  Yet, they don't lose credibility with their style.  If you have followed their history of albums, then you will know that their sound has always changed every 2 albums but still keeping catchy melodies.      One of the Duran Duran's hardest, driven upbeat songs in a long while in my opinion is the title track, \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\".  This is definitely driving music and my favorite on this album.      \\"Falling Down\\" is definitely within style of classic Duran Duran sound.  I will have to give credit to JT for writing a catchy tune that matches the band without making them sound cheesy.  Definitely gets my nod.    \\"Box Full O' Honey\\" is a very organic track with emphasis on guitar and piano.  Great uptempo track with a drum patterns that tease you and flow with great arrangements of change ups.  The variations of the chorus and verse work well.  This is more live instrument and not too much emphasis on synths.    Tracks such as \\"Tempted\\" and \\"Zoom In\\" are futuristic club, groove driven songs that have great breaks and transitions.  Yes, these remind me of the days of \\"All She Wants\\" days.  Synth driven techno road journey.    \\"She's Too Much\\" is a mid-tempo track that reminds me of \\"Wedding Album\\" style with head-nodding groove.  It is a great balance of synths and light guitars.  Very catchy song from the pre-chorus to the harmonies when the chorus comes in.  If you stripped the drums and you made this an acoustic version, I think that it would sound very much like an early Beatles song especially in the chorus.    \\"Dirty Great Monster\\" is a dark Creepy moving song that reminds me of their medazzaland/Pop Trash albums.  I loved those albums even though they were under rated.      \\"Last Man Standing\\" is a bouncy slow moving track that seems to work.  This reminds me of their first album days.    I know that some people may be knocking this album for being over-produced with synths blah blah blah.  In my opinion, this album works because if you notice from their beginnings of their New Wave days, that they were synth driven with hints of disco beats and grooves.  You can't knock them for using drum machines because if you listen to \\"The Chaffeur\\" you can hear old school drum machines in the beginning of the song with synths all over that song.  Same with \\"Save a Prayer\\"...heavy on synths....even back then, though now sounds retro, they had a futuristic quality with an exotic mystique to them.      Overall, this album has really grown on me.  Though, i think that the weak tracks being \\"Skin Divers\\" (for Timbaland makin' an appearance, that to me didn't need to be necessary) and \\"Night Runner\\"...though the later does sound like an updated song that could have been on a Seven and the ragged Tiger album.  Looking forward to where this band will take us next.  I would very much be interested in hearing the Reportage album if they ever decide to release it.
0061120073|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn  By Betty Smith     Have you ever been so poor that you had to save pennies just to have enough money to put food on the table? A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith describes the life of a poor girl growing up in the slums of Brooklyn in the 1920s. Johnny Nolan, her father, was a drunk and always became quiet and depressed when he drank, while Katie Nolan, her mother, worked late and didn't see her family much. Yet, you can tell because of the way Smith describes Katie that she deeply loves her family. Betty Smith talks about Francie's courage to seek a better life. This happens to be my favorite part of the book. In elementary school, on her own initiative, Francie switched schools to get away from the bullies and succeeded to make herself happier.    I love how Francie Nolan has a passion to write and wrote many mythical stories of flowers and rainbows. After her father died, she started writing stories about poverty and people starving. Francie is a unique character for many reasons: I can picture her as she used to run down to get paper dickie shirt collars for her father, and she drank coffee when she was only 10. Although she went through many of life's hardships, she still turned out to be a very nice lady.    I recommend \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", A New York Public Library \\"Book of the Century\\" to anyone and everyone as it was enthralling and interesting, too. It was such a good read that I just couldn't put it down.  -Olivia Fleming
B00004SZWD|5.0|This one reminds me of Prince's Sign O The Times because he tackles so many different genres and it's funky.  Talking Book was a pretty album. Innervisions was a lot darker.  I love listening to this all the way through, and I'll never forget hearing it for the first time.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Games is about a third (third child in the family often disliked by everyone because government wouldn't allow thirds) Named Ender Wiggin who was also a genius. He was a very strong fighter he even killed a kid in the beginning of the book without even knowing it. Ender had two older siblings the oldest is named Peter who was a vicious person, and his sister Valentine who was a very kind person. Peter would often torture Ender while his sister would protect him. One day a man named Graff came to Ender's house to see if he would like to join Battle school which was a school that trained kids to fight their enemy the buggers. Peter and Valentine were rejected by the battle school because peter was too vicious and Valentine was to kind. In the battle school ender made friends with Shen and Alai who were both also very talented. Ender went through the ranks quickly; first he was put in Salamander Company where the commander hated him but after he came over that obstacle he was promoted to leader of Dragon company because of his tactics at the games. When Ender left battle school he went to Commanders School where he was taught by the Famous Strategist Mazar Rackham to defeat the buggers. He was also put through a lot of battle simulation where he was commanding a fleet of ships and his friends from command school were commanding a small amount of ships and they fought against the virtual buggers and each fight was harder then the last but later in the book he finds out the battles with the buggers in the game was real and that all the people that he fought with were real too. This is a very good book for those people who are really into science fiction and even for those who might not be into science fiction.
0920236162|5.0|This is my all-time favorite gift book for young girls. It is a welcome twist on the old and tired \\"damsel in distress\\" storylines. Years ago, when I was a preschool teacher, I read this book to the 4 and 5-year old girls in my class. Unfortunately, even at that tender age, they already were more obsessed with the APPEARANCE of the main character than her bravery. Therefore, I suggest that it be read to boys and girls at an even earlier age so they come to know that what is inside heroine, Elizabeth is far more important than what she wears. I commend the author for providing us with a well-written book that imparts a valuable message to young children.
B000WZB944|5.0|Despite my personal feelings about U2, I can't let that get in the way of my review of this deluxe re-issue.  This album was tremendous and it still is.  The re-mastering of the original album is pretty remarkable, the B sides and studio outtakes found on disc 2 are brilliant.  In fact, you can make a case for buying this deluxe package just for the second disc.  Hardcore U2 fans probably already have these tunes, but casual fans like myself don't.  Here is the best place to get them.<br /><br />I like U2, but have never quite understood the hero worship that went on regarding this band.  I still don't.  But I DO recognize brilliance when I hear it, and The Joshua Tree certainly was all of that and more.  So here's your chance to relive past glories all in digitally re-mastered splendor.......and with killer B sides!  If you're new to U2.....buy this immediately and pay attention.
B000BO0LKY|3.0|Despite the title, don't believe it. Its very surprising that this great album STILL has not been released in its' definitive form.<br /><br />Yes, though this version of the CD contains all the regular tracks from the album as well as some new ones (such as \\"So Lonely\\" and the No. 1 single \\"Don't Forget About Us\\"), it completely misses the mark by neglecting to include two tracks that were recorded for the Mimi sessions. These songs are available on the pricey Japanese Import version of the CD, and also on certain International versions of this album.<br /><br />The two songs are \\"Sprung\\" and \\"Secret Love\\". I would say that they are perhaps the best songs on the album other than \\"We Belong Together\\". \\"Sprung\\" is a futuristic R&B Anthem that has a great chorus, and \\"Secret Love\\" is one of those repetitive Mariah songs that get lodged in your head and just won't let go! Both are essential songs, and it's a pity that most audiences in the US don't even know these songs exist (and yes, they are very much available on foreign editions of this album).<br /><br />Try getting your hands on them, and only then can you claim to have an \\"Ultra Platinum Edition\\" of this CD. In its' current form, this album is still incomplete.
B000000W5L|5.0|This masterpiece is not one of the Stones' more immediately accessible works but repeated listening reveals its treasures. At first it might sound just raw and raucous but eventually the textures start making sense. Exile needs a complete play as the momentum builds through the various styles of the Stones at their most powerful. Vocals are down in the mix and there's a consistent intensity to the music throughout the album. I discern 4 distinct sections, the first of which culminates in the majestic Tumbling Dice.<br /><br />The next segment, introduced by the yearning country strains of Sweet Virginia, starts off softer and slower. Torn And Frayed has a similar soulful country feel - these songs remind me of Far Away Eyes on the 1978 album [[ASIN:B000000W5P Some Girls]] - whilst the catchy Sweet Black Angel with its buoyant rhythm is probably the closest to a pop song on the album. The tuneful Happy is the bridge between this sensitive segment and the harder or bluesier rock of Xxxx On The Run, Ventilator Blues, the atmospheric I Just Want To See His Face and Let It Loose, a stirring, soulful number.<br /><br />The up-tempo hard rock of All Down The Line opens the final section, followed by Stop Breaking Down with its jangling guitars and then Shine A Light with its complex arrangement and changing tempo. The album concludes with the driving rock of Soul Survivor. There are moments on Exile, especially the slower songs, that remind me of 1971's [[ASIN:B000000W5N Sticky Fingers]] while others evoke certain tracks on the aforementioned Some Girls. Exile On Main Street definitely belongs in the Stones top 5 and is a 1970s rock classic.

It grabs your heart and never lets go. I knew in my mind that some people are good and some countries do much better than the USA but now I know there are better places in the world. If I was a young man I would be packing to go to Canada and never look back. This is a powerful film. I will watch it many times and tell all my friends who would listen.

This is a keeper!
B000VDDDY6|3.0|I haven't watched these yet.  My DVR is always packed during the week.  I'll be watching them this weekend since there are really no shows on Friday or Saturday.    The reason this got the stars it did: The price from Amazon was perfect.  Maybe I didn't pay attention to the quality rating though.      The reason I knocked off two stars from perfect: The quality from Amazon was absolutely atrocious.    Now that I'm done with the summary, let me give you some details.  First, there are sellers who are selling this new for about $115 shipped; which is a great price.  I got mine for $107 shipped with Amazon Prime, and I don't regret paying that price as it was almost 25% off Amazon's full price.  The problem, you ask?  Let me count the ways:    1: The outer plastic case was not only cracked, it was partially shattered.  Pieces were all over the place.  It's basically unusable now.    2: two of the disk holders were fractured at the corner.    That's all that needs be said.  Now I can't really complain - the price was right and honestly, all I care about is the movie itself - but I would figure, since this came directly from Amazon that they would quality control it a bit better, or at the very least, refurbish it or something.    UPDATE 12/22: So now I've had an opportunity to actually watch some of these.  I stand by my original stars.  The picture and sound quality is superb but both the order and continuity of the episodes leaves a lot to be desired.  Where's the Captain Pike \\"prologue\\" episodes where Spock was over-acting?  Where he first went to Talos IV?  They just skipped that and went straight to the first episode with Kirk and Spock playing chess.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Over the top, wonderful CGI but Bruce saves the day. This wouldn't have worked without him. Good quality sound and picture; liked having a choice between theatrical and unrated (mostly for the language).
0060763892|2.0|The microbiology in the plot just plain stunk, and I don't mean the production of sulfur or organic acid compounds.  It didn't hold up to what I know about bacteria, viruses and toxins, and while that isn't my area of specialty, it also isn't an area of which I'm ignorant.  Bacteriophages are genus- or species-specific.  It has to do with the way they dock with the bacteria.    I thought the characters were sketchily drawn, little more than video game avatars.  The plot didn't help.  I wouldn't even say the novel was a quick or quickly-moving read, because I kept putting it down.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|This gives life to police procedurals. Well acted and well written. It is incredibly suspenseful and the ending leaves one both breathless and upset (the guy quite possibly could have been caught if the various police dept involved would have shared their info). An indictment of the compartmentalization of our police/sheriff/marshal/etc. communities. and pretty damn horrifying.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I saw this show twice in Vegas, and let me tell you, if you make a trip to Vegas and the only thing you do is watch her show it worth every single penny, her show is amazing from the beginning to the end, I can't wait to have the DVD of the show
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I learned a lot from this movie about restaurant kitchens. But I enjoyed it immensely. This is not a rollicking Pixar like the Toy Story's or Monsters; it is quieter like the 'incredibles'. It is a story told with animation. Amazing things with CG these days and excellent voice characterizations. This is not so much for the little ones (it's almost 2 hours) but for older kids (9ish and above, I would guess).<br />Lots of extras.
0375812024|5.0|This book has so many great pictures and a cute story. My son is 23 months and learned so much about the planes and the airport. He also seemed to pick up more vocabulary as we went over the terminal and other areas of the airport. Highly recommend!
B000RJO578|3.0|Overall, quite a fun movie. Starts off joyously, gets a bit slow, then really picks up. Much humor and silliness. This was quite fun.
B000002MP2|5.0|Green Day rocketed into the mainstream with this outstanding effort in 1994, Dookie. The singles, Longview, Basket Case, Welcome to Paradise, and When I Come Around are incredible and I have seen the music videos countless times, but the album really shines on the songs that were not singles. These songs spread a message that people of all ages can relate to, a bleek sense of life but at the same time a sense of hope. Green Day gives you the ups and downs of life on this album and does it in a catchy, melodic way. Nice Job!
B00005JPLW|2.0|Caption says it all. It was loud. Had some amazing stuff. But that's it.<br />enuf said.
B000YAF4OS|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan for many years and \\"The Mist\\" has been my favorite all time creation of his.  Long awaiting and hoping for a movie version of this novella, I can without a doubt state that this more than meets the high standards wished for in a film.  The supermarket atmosphere is claustrophobic as the man and his son cope with panicking customers, bloody survivors and horror packed upon horror.  Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harding are superb in their roles, especially the latter as Mrs. Carmody.  Her over the top performance is suited for a person who is over the top in the story line.  The character is as frightening as any creature in the Mist.    The ending is different from the short story and I will not spoil it.  It is quite a shocker and unexpected.  In fact, after four days, I am still haunted by it.  This is perhaps the greatest film I have ever seen for it's emotional impact. I highly recommend it to all.  It does not have the gore of other recent flicks in this genre but the constant suspense and terror more than make up for it.
0099481685|5.0|Since Grisham is usually associated with nail biting, gripping stories, Skipping Christmas may be something of a surprise to those unfamiliar with the book.<br /><br />Skipping Christmas is lite reading at its best.  The story is entertaining and the humor is just right.  Haven't we all felt at one time or another like skipping the hectic holiday season with all its demands on time and the pocket book?  Grisham delivers a well crafted story that most readers will be able to relate to.<br /><br />NOT lite reading, but another great Christmas book:[[ASIN:0757300537 Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices]].
B000J10ERO|1.0|If I was an investor for this movie, i would've fired Singer on the spot.  Why is it that some directors or producers have to put their own personal stamp on everything they touch?  Everything from the story line to the suit can be sumed up in one word....PREPOSTEROUS.  These are the type of clowns you would send to clean up Mount Rushmore only to find that they felt Washington would look better with a moustache.  Some subtle changes, I can buy, but this movie went over the deep end and inspite of all the changing, the movie still sucks!!!!  No original script, no original soundtrack, nothing!  The special effects are great but can't salvage the film.  Advice for Mr. Singer or anybody else that might pick up the sequel.....Let's clean up the Man of Steel a bit and let's get down to some original writing.
0061148512|5.0|I have always loved this book.  Plath's literature is exceptional, in my opinion.  But the reason I bought this copy, even though I already own one, is because there are a few of Plath's sketches included in this edition.  It may seem insignificant, but for someone who likes Plath, this should be quite a treat!
0722538960|5.0|I found comfort in every word of this book.  Reading it validated that I am not only \\"not crazy\\", but that I have something wonderful to offer this de-sensitized world of ours.  It's taken me many years, but I am finally realizing that being \\"different\\" can and usually is a genuinely good thing!  All those years of hearing people describe me as \\"overly sensitive\\" as if it were some major character flaw certainly left their mark on me.  Now, however, I can look upon my sensitivity as a gift - as something special and unique.  I am happy being me.  I am happy to have this book on my shelf.  It has become a haven where I dwell when I need reminded that I belong, just as I am.
0385424736|5.0|I loved this book!!! I didn't want to finish it because it was so good!! I recommend it for any type reader.
B000UR366S|5.0|This is Joni Mitchell's best album since FOR THE ROSES. It harks back to her early work, but is a VERY mature album, displaying her ability to meld the different styles (folk, jazz, rock) that comprise her earlier periods.<br /><br />I also think her voice improved some, as she has more of her old range with less of the rasp she had on BOTH SIDES NOW (2000).<br /><br />After reading her comments in the Hear Music (Starbrew) I thought she was done. It was really a treat to have her new music.
0684853523|4.0|...by Stephen King's On Writing.  I thought I didn't like Stephen King, was put off by his penchant for the ugly possibilities of life.  Then I read this book where he shares both his own \\"back story\\" and the principles of a work ethic that won't quit.  I am quite the connoisseur of writer's how-to's...okay, I'm an addict.  In fact I've made a non-career of reading these things instead of settling down to the scariness of actual writing.  Stephen King offers a saving boot in the rear to such timidity.  He makes the process sound like fun.  He empathizes with the fear of failure but not for long.  I especially appreciated his advice on first drafts versus second, attitudes  of approach.  His relentless emphasis on the importance of story gave me pause.  Is it true I really have no stories to tell?  What's behind such a sad premise?  What does my impoverished reading record have to do with this flabby fictive sense?  True, the guy often talks like the raunchier boys back in high school.  But I'm sixty-five now.  Maybe I should get over it.  Maybe we both should.  In any case, forty-four years of preparation is enough.  I recommend this no nonsense (King would call it no something else) guide to getting on with it.
B0000640VO|4.0|This is a fun adventure that only slightly stretches the credibility of what could actually happen in real life.  I don't know whether to credit the actors, the director, or the script writer, but the everything just seems plausible and believable.  This movie explores each character's personality and you can find yourself watching it and wanting to tell them to get over their fears and stop living in the rut they find themselves in.  When its all over, some will temporarily break out of those ruts, others get what they deserve, and Amelie is in a position to live happily ever after.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|Great songs old and new.  The integration of the newer material with older titles was just right.  He is still the best!
B000UGG39Q|3.0|All the elements are there to make this a competent serving of southern groove metal. The riffs are heavy and are churned out with that infectious southern swagger. Sabbath and Skynard elements abound.     However, for my money, the album is at its best when it breaks from the standard southern metal sound and into more meandering, epic territory. This is best encapsulated by the last track on the album track 'Nothing In Return (Walk Away)' nearly nine minutes of sweeping melody and organ vibrato, punctuated with forceful metal punch and more than a hint of grunge (when I first listened to the album I repeated that track two or three times).    However, it doesn't make up for the preceding songs on the album, which seem basic in comparison, and overall the album lacks the originality to leave any lasting impression or warrant too many repeat listens.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|This is Quentin Tarantino's worst movie by a large margin.  Only six killings, two action sequences, no gratuitous nudity, and over a hundred minutes of mindless dialog.  I'm glad the DVD release didn't pair this turkey with the awesome movie, Planet Terror.  What a disappointment!
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Like some of the other reviewers, I caught this guy live (opening for another act) and was blown away.  That he is a songwriter too only sweetens the pot.  This is strong music with a young, bold, but appealable theme.  Many cliches come to mind, but all accurate (honest, refreshing, whatever).  I can't believe this isn't getting more radio play (or maybe I can).  Some recommendations: Lightning (an oddly gentle song about being electrocuted for murder), Guys Like Me (the one you might have heard on the radio), How 'Bout You (another in the long tradition of \\"this is who I am\\" country rockers) and Pledge Alligiance to the Hag (a Merle Haggard tribute that should be played at full volume).  Man this guy is goooood.
0385333846|5.0|Anyone who is looking for a fun read should give this book a try. While it may not be everyones cup of tea it is definately well written and thoughtful.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Awe-Some. Jeff Lindsay created a perfect character. Michael C. Hall portrays him perfectly. The plot is intriguing. Even the soundtrack is great.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille DVD - This is a CLASSIC!  It totally reflects the PIXAR (rather than Disney)  side of creativity and story-line.  Need a gift for a FOODIE in your life?  They don't need to have kids - or even enjoy kids -- to LOVE this movie.  But kids adore it, too.  It's sophisticated - but easily accessible.  ONE CAVEAT:  I would NOT get this for kids under SIX - the opening scene involves a grandmother who, upon finding rats in her kitchen, goes on an extended shooting spree that can be scary for little kids.  I was relieved to find the rest of the movie in a totally different genre.
B000HD1AEA|5.0|This double CD set is amazing and helped me through one, if not the toughest time of my life. Sarah's voice and music is incredible. I love all of these songs. \\"Witness\\" is so much better on here than the original recording. As I listen to this now, it gives off a completely different feeling than her studio albums. Thank you Sarah for all of your beautiful music.
0061120073|5.0|I recently read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for the first time. I loved it. If I had to compare it to another book to someone else, I would say it compares to Angela's Ashes, though I enjoyed this one more.     I did not like this particular book though because it has rough cut pages where the each page edge is different. I just don't care for that, and had I known that this edition was like that, I would have bought a different copy.     But you can't go wrong with the book.
B00005JCA9|5.0|The first DVD contaisn the movie, the second contains the musi \\"SHE\\" and some other stuff, nice price
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I LOVED the Gilmore Girls. Had watched it every week, watched reruns whenever I could and purchased each and every season when they came out on DVD. This last season was really a disappointment. I do say however that at least the series finale somewhat pulled it all together, in the little time they had when no one knew if it would be the last season or not. I am still hoping for a 2 hour movie that would really let us see what the characters are up too. If not I have to just tell myself that Loreli and Luke get it together and Rory is a famed writer somewhere!
B00005JPNW|3.0|The movie adaptation of The Golden Compass should please most people if they had not read the book. I haven't.<br /><br />Based on the first of three Philip Pullman's books in the trilogy of his Dark Materials, the Northern Lights, this is a whimsical tale of how a precociously unconventional girl is set on a task to free children who are about to be separated from their personal dæmon after receiving a mysterious golden compass. The golden compass which is an alethiometer. which seeks to help tell find the truth to the puzzles on her journey. Along the way, she discovers grave conspiracies and receives help from the Egyptians, the witches as well as the an armoured bear.<br /><br />Dakota Blue Richards who play the orphaned girl, Lyra Belacqua, is excellent in her part due to the maturity she displays as the quick-witted Lyra. While the film also bills Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman as the main draw, both have substantially less screen time as Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter respectively. However, Kidman as Mrs Coulter is maleficent and unscrupulous with her equally demonic dæmon, a golden monkey. Kidman's eyes possesses the kind of menace that is intended to kill.<br /><br />The film does suffer at having to adapt a large amount of the book into 2 hours. Characters are introduced swiftly and the audience is expected to know them well. However, the splendid acting and CGI effects do compensate some of that inadequacy.
0060899190|5.0|I just recently bought the entire collection of the PostSecret books and I'm really glad I did. I found the books to be inspirational because when I read through them, the secrets remind me how much I'm not different from other people.  It just a very human book and it's refreshing to see others being so honest about what they have experianced. One particular secret I read was worth buying the book just to be able to read that one secret whenever I wanted.  I think these books make great gifts as well, especially for friends who took pysch!  I recommend them, just to have them.
B000ZBEOF6|5.0|I rushed out to see this movie when I heard this was its last week in the theatre, which turned out to be nearly empty, probably because picky professional critics had trumpeted flaws in the singing by the unknown actors.  I am glad I got to see this on the big screen.    I was only eleven years old when the Beatles first big hit came out, and I wondered if I'd remember the words, and if the songs would be ruined.  Some of the faster songs are sung very slowly, for example, and most are sung with very little musical accompaniment. But I was not disappointed.  Lyrics long buried under the music in the original songs were easy to understood, and the actors sing beautifully.   I heard the spirit of the original tunes, with all the fun, sadness, defiance, introspection, and joy the Beatles expressed so well in the original recordings.    This movie will give people born after the 1960s a good feeling for what life was like in that turbulent period.  Across the Universe embodies the spirit of the times and expresses many of the contradictions and social conflicts that are still with us forty years later.    It's really too bad that the professional critics smothered this movie out of the theatres.  Apparently their delicate sensibilities are offended by arcane imperfections in the vocals.  These critics remind me of people who get all huffy about the flaws of a home music system that doesn't cost a fortune, even though mere mortals cannot sense the imperfections.   Folks, don't worry, the singing is just fine, so get the movie and enjoy the soundtrack.    In the Mel Brooks classic History of the World, Part I, the \\"world's first art critic\\" aims yellow body fluid at the \\"world's first painting\\" on the wall of a cave.   Fortunately today the internet liberates us from these sophisticated arbiters of good taste.  I am one ordinary Beatles fan who enthusiastically recommends this movie.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|1989's \\"Batman\\" was rightly a cinematic hit.  Directed by Tim Burton, it features a dark and brooding storyline, amazing sets, a well-chosen cast, and an update on the technology traditionally associated with the Batman character.<br /><br />Michael Keaton was a surprising choice as the Dark Knight, by day a weathly philanthropist, by night the Caped Crusader.  Keaton's touch is to portray on-screen, and successfully, the motivation of a scarred childhood that drives Bruce Wayne to create and live through his alter-ego, Batman.  This Batman fights crime in a black rubber and kevlar-armored suit, using a variety of gadgets to come and go from crime scenes.<br /><br />Batman's opponent in this film is the Joker, played with over-the-top maniacal evil by Jack Nicholson in an Academy-Award-nominated performance.  The Joker is a gangland hood who survives betrayal and an industrial accident on a job, emerging as the deformed and now insane master of crime in Gotham City.<br /><br />Beautiful photojournalist Vickie Vale, earnestly played by Kim Basinger, becomes the object of desire of both men.  Their parallel story arcs will intersect in her person, who is kidnapped by the Joker and must be rescued by Batman, in a spectacular finale set in the bell tower Gotham Cathedral.<br /><br />Burton's superb direction takes full advantage of the brooding, spectacular and vaguely retro sets; if this movie has any fault, it is that scene, mood, and setting tend to overwhelm the characters.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as excellent entertainment for fans of the Batman franchise.  Its success sparked three lesser sequels, with Valmer Kilmer and George Clooney taking their turns as Batman while being crowded off the stage by their respective villians.
B000UJ48U4|1.0|I'm a big fan of nearly all of Kubirck's films but this one... sadly was a disaster for me. One thing I enjoy about his films is that certain emotional detachment the viewer has with the characters. Even the Shining kept the viewer strictly a point of view of a witness powerless to change or affect the drama played out before us. What makes EWS different is the universality of the subject matter and the world that (sort of) looks a lot like ours. Sex, power and the struggle between lovers is not a subject to viewed from a distance but one to be emotionally involved with. EWS in my opinion fails on this level. All the characters are going through very human problems yet none of them are sympathetic, interesting or like-able. The surreal depiction of New York at Christmas time with people walking about with fully wrapped presents is just bizarre, in fact the whole look of film is stagey and alien. As much as I would love to have this film as another and sadly last film of Kubrick's to cherish I cannot convince myself that the master has taken on a story and subject that he did not fully understand or was inclined to do justice to.

B00006I53S|5.0|I think this is the best telephoto lens you can get for the money. The quality is much better than the kit lens, I've gotten some really nice photos with it on my XTi. The wide angle might not be good enough for everybody with a cropped sensor camera like the XTi but it works for 90% of the photos I take. The build quality might not be as good as an L series, but its definitely better than most other non-Canon lenses (sigma, tamron, etc). The IS seems to work well. I am definitely digging this new lens.
0060899190|5.0|I loved this book, it is totally fascinating, even my boyfriend couldn't put it down!
B000VWYNNW|4.0|Yes, they edited some of the songs, not always for the better.  Yes, if you are a purist who cannot believe they would mess with the original masters of this album, you'll be disappointed.        But here's the good stuff: it sounds incredible, there are a lot of previously unreleased songs here, and any live Zeppelin is better than no live Zeppelin! I do think How the West Was Won was overall a better release, but turn this one up loud on your stereo, and you really won't care (OK, I really don't care...not sure about you!)    The version of the Rain Song is nearly perfect.  Page's guitar work on the song just makes my jaw drop.  The Ocean has some great rhythm work from Bonham and Jones.  Dazed and Confused is always a show-stopper, and Black Dog is quite good.  Yes, there are a few \\"so-so\\" versions of the songs on here, but plenty to recommend.  And as I said, the louder I turn it up on my stereo, the less I seem to care!!! I really liked the packaging on the CD (including an essay from the great Cameron Crowe) and I feel like I got my money's worth here.
B00007L4OM|5.0|Very entertaining movie, that is both an action movie and kind of a comedy as well as there are many funny scenes in it. Jean Reno carries the movie, which is set in a Japanese environment with Japanese gangsters and what not. Certainly preferable to any classical Hollowood movie.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|This CD is better than I expected from James Blunt.  I have not listened to his first CD because the songs \\"You're Beautiful\\" and \\"High,\\" which I heard from radio, were grating to my ears and turned me off.  But then I heard \\"1973\\" on the radio and thought, James Blunt really can put out a good, catchy song that does not get on your nerves!  So I gave him a chance on his sophomore release.  Well, I was not disappointed, let me tell you.  On this album, he reminds me of Peter Gabriel and, especially, Death Cab for Cutie.  These are compliments - unless you don't like those sorts of bands!  \\"I'll Take Everything\\" and \\"Carry You Home\\" are two other standout tracks.  Blunt manages to temper down his vocal style some so that he is not so grating, but he is still plenty emotional.  Generally, the songs tend to be melancholy, but in a good way - they complement Blunt's vocal style.  No desperate falsetto warbling can be found on this album (\\"YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!  YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!\\"), or at least he manages to use it in a good context.  I would give this album a shot if you had doubts about James Blunt before.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|I know most people have seen this movie already so I will not even bother to review the film itself, but what I will review is the picture and audio quality of this film and all I can say is buy this film. If you are a fan of this picture and already own it buy it again anyways because on bluray the picture quality is superb, it seems an though it was shot yesterday. The audio quality is excellent as well but the picture quality is what will have you astonished.
0709082819|5.0|I was too anxious to wait for the US release so I impatiently paid a small fortune early September to get a hardback from the UK.  From the time UPS delivered it until I finished it sometime around 3 am, I was thoroughly engaged.  As in Mr Darcy's Diary, Amanda Grange masterfully writes Captain Wentworth with a strong, clear voice lightly seasoned with a sense of humor.  I so enjoyed reading his observations and his interpretations of each situation.  My heart was all static each time Anne and he would have any conversation or when he would recall anything about her.  It was most delightful to read his innermost thoughts as he discovered, or admitted rather, his unyielding love for Anne.  Most satisfied and highly recommended.
B000IOM0WO|5.0|Every fan of the irish band U2 must have this Blu-Ray Disc. The picture and sound quality is amazing.  This is Barbara from Vienna, Austira.
B000002VE7|4.0|\\"Stereotomy\\" is another good APP disc.  This one is probably one of the band's hardest rocking.  APP is never really heavy, but there are some really good rockers on this one including the title track, \\"In The Real World\\", \\"Beaujolais\\", and \\"Stereotomy Two\\".  The ballads are all strong as well.  \\"Limelight\\" is outstanding and \\"Light Of The World\\" is also a nice one.  The only weak point on this disc is the instrumentals.  They are ok, but are not on a par with some of APPs better ones.  It is also notable that Eric Wolfson only sings a portion of one song on the whole disc which seems unusual.   Overall this is not the best APP album, but I have always enjoyed it.
B000002USN|5.0|i purchased FRANK SINATRA \\"DUETS AND DUETS 2\\". \\"DUETS\\" IS  A BARGAIN AT TRIPLE THE COST.

B000SFJWLU|5.0|When I first heard this band I was so blown away because I realized the band's cd had been on my recommendations list, on here, for weeks and had never attempted to listen to them. Needless to say, after hearing them I went out and bought the cd and have been playing it since.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This concert is the type of concert that only comes around every twenty years or so, Madonna's Confessions on a dance floor era will certainly be remembered as one of the high points of her career. She's 48 and she looks simply divine, she keeps up with the dancers that are almost twenty years her junior. I am also very glad to report that all the songs were sung live, which is good because she actually sounds better live. Each song was so unique, the visuals where stunning. The performance of 'Live to tell' was fantastic and had me awestruck, 'Isaac' was exotic and gorgeous and was rich with political symbolism, the Arabic horn, the American eagle set free. I particularly liked the rockin performance of 'I Love New York', i almost stood up in my lounge room and cheered when she told her critics to suck George Bushes ****. And then again i was impressed by the 70's inspired music (inferno remix). This Spectacular decedent Concert made a fan out of me.
B000FA57RG|5.0|CD Review:   The first cd is a first ever live production of Madonna's Re-Invention concert. The tracks flow one after the other and although the album is live content, the beats hit just as hard as any studio album! It grooves and thumps its way along the highlights of the concert!My favorite tracks are Nobody Knows Me, Vogue and I Love New York, but don't worry they all rock!     DVD Review:   First off, this look behind the scenes of the tour is twice as good as the original tour documentary. This is the best documentary I've seen EVER.  I watched it with great enthusiasm and extreme admiration the female pop-star. She -once more- proved that she really is the Queen of Pop, a tremendous trend-setter as far as fashion, politics and religion are concern. Her show was clearly provocative but was extremely inspired and glamorous. Madonna stands alone between two worlds... The stage and her family. There are numerous juxtapositions inside the film...Madonna is spectacular on the stage, but she is also a woman with political and ethical values. Madonna shows that she pulls out all the stops and never fails to push the envelope in any department, in this case it's political. \\"I'm Going To Tell You A Secret\\" chronicles the events of her 2004 \\"Re-Invention World Tour\\" and Madonna showcases herself as a pop sensation, devoted Mother and Wife, political warrior, and most of all, her true self and her devotion to the study of Kaballah. From the beginning with the opening of \\"The Beast Within\\", Madonna begins with her partnership with music producer Stuart Price and having a very candid conversation about God and her beliefs and throughout the documentary, voices her opinion on the political and material world we live in today, yet she never comes across as preachy. There are several clips of her performances from the concert and her views on life off stage. It's genuinely touching, making us realize that we all have to be grateful for the blessings that we have in life and to not take them for granted. Want what you have and not what you don't is one of the most important messages. Her rendition of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" is absolutely mind blowing. The images depicted of the poverty stricken countries during the song is enough to make the toughest of people cry their eyes out. She delivers many important messages with her dancers and states that we all enter the world as better people than who we are and have compassion for all mankind and take into consideration the pain and suffering that is going on in the world. Without taking responsibility for your own actions and watching what you say to others makes your talents useless. This is so true. Madonna never ceases to amaze and impress and expose the world to closeted issues that must be tackled. In her own words, we are all responsible for making the world a better place. You could not ask for a better documentary. Even the if you're the least bit involved in her art/music and not an aficionado, anyone would appreciate this masterpiece. It is highly recommended.
0374105235|5.0|The gripping story of what an ordinary boy must do to survive a war that rips him from his family and makes everyone he meets suspicious of his motives. I picked up this book with dread, knowing it would be a harsh depiction of war, but his unflinching account of the atrocities he committed, coupled with his beautiful prose, made this a fast, intense read.
1592332803|5.0|As a new \\"vegan\\" family my husband and 2 teenagers were terrified that eating a healthier, more socially responsible diet would mean giving up all the wonderful baked goods we love.  I've been cooking for many years but didn't really know how to manage converting my old life recipes into foods we could eat.  This book is wonderful!  I'm able to find the ingredients and (don't laugh) pronounce all the ingredient's names.  The foods taste wonderful (no saw dust goodies here).  I can't imagine anyone who likes to bake not loving this book....and when my picky teenagers ask for me to bake \\"food we can eat\\" and report back to me that they had to share with everyone else -- we know we have a hit!

B000M4RG42|5.0|Flags Of Our Fathers was an extraordinary movie.  The emotions of the soldiers trying to deal with a tough situation, and the emotions during the battle scenes.  Everything about the film was about as well-written as a war story can possibly be.  Going into the movie, I personally didn't know much about the Iwo Jima flag raising moment.  I knew it took place obviously, but I didn't know how much of a story could be told from that alone.  Trust me, there's a lot about that flag that really surprised me, and I was left feeling like I learned a lot about the war and this particular moment in time.    I'd say you could compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan in terms of war realism and phenomenal acting abilities from the characters who portrayed the soldiers.  It wasn't as violent compared to the Tom Hanks film (or as frequent) but Flags Of Our Fathers really showed you what it was like to be a soldier with feelings.  The soldiers in the film weren't portrayed as just mindless shooting robots.  Nope, while watching the movie you got to know these guys and their families.  It wasn't just shooting and war scenes throughout the film.    I also never gave much thought to what must be going through the mind of a soldier while fighting a war.  They aren't just there to fight for our country, but they're also out there fighting for each other, and saving their friends during horrible and violent moments.  That's something I really never thought about before watching this movie.  I think it's a fantastic movie and deserves all the attention and awards it has received.      The movie also did a brilliant job focusing on certain soldiers lives after the war was over, and what became of them.  I truly enjoyed this film.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|The premise for this movie was great!  It could have been a spectacular film, especially with the way talented Kurt Russell handled his role as the automobile-homicidal killer, but the lengthy dialog was brutal.  The topics that were being discussed for time unending were nonsensical and had absolutely nothing to do with the movie.  Through conversations galore you learn all about a few girls and their lives, not to be set up for something in the plot that pertains to their conversations, but to have them killed moments later in a mere few seconds.  What seemed like hours upon hours of dreadful dialog and tiny amounts of action led to the two stars above. The car chase made the one star a two for me.  This movie was simply ridiculous and a total waste of time!  Quentin Tarantino is too in love with himself to film a movie the proper way (with less meaningless dialog and a hint of suspense).  Here's one for ya Quentin, why don't you stop doing tributes to other dated film eras and do something creative, original, and up to par with today's film genres! STOP LIVING IN THE PAST! IT'S GONE ALREADY!!!!!    EDIT: I went back and watched this movie again, thinking that I must have missed something, and I did. It really wasn't so bad, and the girl on the hood of the car was simply incredible!!!!! Raising to 3 stars!

0679746323|2.0|A number of reviews, such as the one titled &#34;Totalitarian mode of argument,&#34;  have argued more eloquently than I could that this book's patronizing writing and judgmental presentation makes it read like totalitarian propaganda. I wanted to point out another bit of irony that no one else seems to have brought up.<br /><br />In her previous book, Wild Swans, which has writing I admire but content that could benefit from more honesty, author Jung Chang notes in front that &#34;in order to describe their functions accurately&#34; she has changed the translation of &#34;xuan-chuan-bu&#34; (&#34;the Department of Propaganda&#34;) to &#34;the Department of Public Affairs.&#34;  The author's father, a heroic character in the memoir, had been a co-director in such a department.<br /><br />Guess how she translates the same &#34;xuan-chuan-bu&#34; in Mao: The Unknown Story? Well, you guessed it. It is changed back to &#34;the Department of Propaganda.&#34; Mao once headed such a department. This time Chang does not provide a note on how much she cares about the translation accuracy.<br /><br />So why the need to deploy hypocrisy?<br /><br />Because: though Jung Chang was a Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution, and her parents were active and loyal members of the Communist Party, they did nothing bad. They were all good. Objects that were once associated with them must be translated in commendatory terms accordingly. &#34;Love the house, love the crows stopping on its roof.&#34;<br /><br />And: Mao was evil from birth to death. He was all bad. Thus the same objects, when associated with him, must be translated in derogatory terms.<br /><br />In China we call this &#34;Red Guard language.&#34; Jung Chang was a Red Guard at the critical age of learning - and she apparently picked up the language well, even decades of living in the West have not made her drop it.
1401300529|4.0|Halberstam has done an admirable job of capturing the futility of the Korean War while simultaneously focussing on the personalities--both at the MacArthur and Truman level and the fighting man level.  While there is some infelicitous writing (twice he refers to President Kennedy, saying he \\"upped the ante\\"), the book is easy to read, and is satisfying history.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My 2 year grand daughter absolutely loves this dvd and it brought back great memories for myself as well.  Came in a timely manner and in great condition.
B00000DG1R|4.0|This is a great compliation of Duran Duran hits from the awesome 80s and the lackluster 90s.  However, when I purchased this CD, I was dismayed to see that DD decided to add in \\"Serious\\" from the Liberty bomb of 1990 and \\"Electric Barbarella\\" from the Medazzaland bomb of 1997.  There are several DD tunes that could have been added (all of which performed better on the charts than these 2 stinkers).  DD could have added, \\"My Own Way\\", \\"Careless Memories\\", \\"The Chauffeur\\", \\"New Religion\\", and \\"Hold Back The Rain\\".      But, even though these two disappointing anchors weigh down this album, the rest of the songs bring back great memories for those of who were lucky enough to grow up in the 80s.  \\"Is There Something I Should Know?\\" (my all-time favorite DD song) starts the CD off on a rollicking clip.  This song just cannot be ignored and your feet start dancing before your brain can start thinking.  One other big asset is the #1 Bond Hit, \\"A View To A Kill\\" (the only James Bond theme song to ever hit #1).  This 1985 classic is when DD was at the top of their game and could have dominated the remaining 80s, if it hadn't been for the band breaking up.  The CD builds momentum with the great dance hits of \\"The Reflex\\", \\"Wild Boys\\", \\"Union Of The Snake\\", \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\", \\"Planet Earth\\", and \\"Girls On Film\\".      The only thing that the production company compromised was the slow-build towards the opening dance riff in \\"Rio\\" was omitted and \\"Save A Prayer\\" was completely butchered in favor of a shorter version.  I assume this was due to space limitations of the CD capacity.  I can see why \\"Notorious\\", \\"Skin Trade\\", \\"I Don't Want Your Love\\", \\"Ordinary World, and \\"Come Undone were added to \\"Greatest\\".  But, why oh why, waste time and space with \\"All She Wants Is\\", a very low-performing hit from mid-1989.      If you are a fan of the 80s DD, this is still a great compilation to pick up, especially with the addition of \\"New Moon On Monday\\", which was stupidly omitted fromtheir first greatest hits release, \\"Decade\\".  If you are a fan of the 90s DD, there is still some stuff here for you (although I'm convinced the band sold out to please the 90s fans with the additions of \\"Electric Barbarella\\" and \\"Serious\\", so that they could sell more CDs).  I think even if these 2 song-bombs had been omitted originally and nothing was put in its place, the CD would have still sold millions of copies.      The next time DD puts out a greatest hits compilation, I hope that they will release at least a 2 CD set with a heavy emphasis on the founding 80s, less emphasis on the band changes of the 90s, and lots of \\"Astronaut\\" hits from 2004.  If \\"Reach Up For The Sunrise\\" and \\"What Happens Tomorrow\\" were added and \\"Serious\\" and \\"Electric Barbarella\\" were dumped, then this will be a true stretch to the greatest.  Unfortunately, DD production teams will probably litter the 2 CD release with some current bombs from the \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\".

B000OLGCI4|5.0|What needs to be said? It's Disney, it's The Jungle Book, it's a classic that is never dated or out of style. It's as popular as it was 40 years ago. I decided if my grandbabies(2&4) are going to be cartoon watching, they are going to have access to 'GOOD' cartoons and movies. This movie and Disney Peter Pan are the first of many Disney classics they will be getting for birthdays and Christmases.
B000OYC3J8|2.0|Well on first listen i didn't particular care for the album. I still don't care for it that much. It has some good songs but it just seems Jack White has ran out of steam. The raconteurs album was actually better than this. Perhaps White has forgotten what it takes to make a great album and can't do it all anymore. He may need some help and i really don't think Meg White does much when it comes to albums like icky thump. She's an adequate drummer at best. On the other hand Jack White has always been full of talent but the last two have dropped the ball (even Elephant to an extent). Maybe Jack White just isn't as talented as i thought he was or maybe he just isn't who i thought he is. After two clunkers in a row the next Stripes album isn't gonna be an automatic buy for me like the last few. White still has some good rock songs left in him but maybe he needs to take a little longer between albums and focus a bit more on what he is releasing or maybe he just doesn't care. Fans either like it or hate it but he at least is still doing what he loves. I say good for him but I'll need something better than Icky Thump before or I pick up the next one. It's got its moments but they are few and far between. Major disappointment to me.
B000Y179KO|3.0|The long-promised new cd by the Eagles had finally arrived.  I don't know when the last time I had such great anticipation over a new cd.    I give the cd a 10.......a 7 for disc one and a 3 for disc 2.    Disc one sounds a little like they were trying to recreate \\"The Long Run\\". The problem is that memorable songs are few. It starts with \\"No More Walks In the Woods\\" which has been compared to \\"Seven Bridges Road\\".  Please!  This whiny song doesn't compare to the old classic.  \\"Waiting in the Weeds\\" is a classic and the best song on both cd's that will unfortunately never be heard by the masses.  \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\" is a witty song with the right amount of Don Henley bite to it.  Glenn Frey sounds much like where we last heard him in the post-Eagles 80's.  His songs are pleasant but not outstanding.    Disc 2 is a disaster.  If you've heard Henley's \\"Inside Job\\" then there's no reason to hear disc 2.  These must be songs that didn't make it onto his last solo disc.  Henley doesn't seem to get the irony of his complaining about big business ripping the average guy off and then the Eagles charging over $100 a ticket for their concerts.      Overall a minor disappointment.  Disc 1 is pleasant enough but leave disc 2 in the package!
B000NVIXFK|1.0|Let's get this painful writing out of the way.     I have been listening to Rush for 25 years and count myself as a dedicated fan of most of what they've produced.    S&A is terrible.     Read the 1 star and 2 star reviews for the reasons, as they are numerous.     The one facet that hit me between the eyes from the first listening is the complete breakdown of their song-making methodology. It reminds me of a Rockline interview Geddy gave back in the late '80s. When asked how the \\"Music by Lee & Lifeson. Lyrics by Peart\\" thing worked, Geddy commented that, although complex, Neil's writing rarely left him \\"with a mouth full of words I can't sing\\" (paraphrased).     From start to finish, Geddy sounds like he has a mouthful of words that are not only un-sing-able, but are lacking in the creative insight which has been one of Rush's halmarks. Really, really terrible, and SAD to boot.    Is this the end of the road???
140130916X|4.0|Cecelia Ahearn's book P.S., I Love You is a poignant story. It gives the reader an uplifting ray of hope for anyone wanting to understand what moving on after the a death of a loved one might be. Especially if you are young and feel your life might be over. Holly and Gerry are in love and have a ordinary life.  His sudden death leaves her heartbroken and empty. Knowing he would die, Gerry takes measures to hopefully get her to move on. He writes her a series of letters to be mailed one by one, challenging her to do something she is not comfortable with or something that will spark a memeory. With each step you see her gain her footing again, trying to let go of Gerry and move on. (I myself was never far from a box of tissues.)    It is easy to read through this book and I recommend it to anyone wanting to know what hope can be and that is could be around the corner. This book takes anyone experiencing the loss of a loved one or even a best friend and tries to point them on a journey to recovery. It shows how to keep that memeory alive, deep inside in a safe place, but also instilling how moving on will in some ways stop them wasting away from their loss.    There is a movie based on the most part from this book due out Dec 21, 2007. I will be there to see it. Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler play Holly and Gerry. It will be a great tribute to this book.
0375714839|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, as demonstrated by the fact that I read it in two days. This new edition (which promotes the movie that comes out on 12/25) combines the two separate books into one volume. The story is fascinating, the drawings are alternately funny and haunting. Highly recommended for anyone interested in such topics as Iran, women and Islam or for fans of graphic novels.
0143038419|5.0|I am liking the book very much.  Only about halfway through, but feel that I already know the author personally as she reveals so much of herself.  Helps me to get in touch with my spiritual self. It is definitely a women's read, but would recommend it to anyone.
140120306X|5.0|Imagine you are a civilian, who has known nothing more than reality as you have seen it so far. Perhaps you have read some interesting stories, if any of these stories have survived or if you've been privy to them. Now, imagine someone hands you a book. It is hard-bound, but not heavy at all. There is a long cloth strip of a bookmark in it. It appears to be some kind of log, or journal.<br /><br />You open this black-covered book and find yourself sifting through a whole variety of ephemera -- from the 1600s all the way to the late 1940s or 50s. In it, you find accounts from various \\"unpersons,\\" or \\"fictional characters\\" or beings and people with special abilities do simply do not exist. You know that this information, and everything in there is top secret and was meant to be only viewed by a select few. Even the writing on the margins of the articles is not meant for \\"prole\\" eyes.<br /><br />And yet this is being shared with you. Everything is being shared with you -- from journal accounts of sorcerers and paramours, to designs, to reports on strange eldritch activities all the way to a \\"lost\\" first folio of Shakespeare and even a Beatnik narrative. There is a wide gamut of narratives in different forms which all seem to say the same thing: that there has been a group that has done extraordinary things, and extraordinary things are therefore revealed about them.<br /><br />The narratives revealed are not simply \\"told,\\" as opposed to \\"shown\\" -- that is an old fallacy that must always be questioned and never taken for granted with regards to creative writing. You as the reader are included in this world that Moore creates, let in on some very fabulous secret that temporal powers want to be kept. And what is this secret? Without spoiling the particulars for you, the secret is that these figures and fiction inspire us, are no less real than our personas and will live as long as the human imagination.<br /><br />This is what The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The Black Dossier means to me as a reader -- something participatory, novel and fun. All I will add to this statement is please, look at the title of the work, read it, and then come to your conclusion. You are looking at a \\"secret book\\" that really isn't and shouldn't be one.<br /><br />That is what a Black Dossier is to me.reader -- something participatory, novel and fun.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|I enjoyed this very much as it made me aware of a historical event that I was previously unaware of.  It does it in a very dramatic 118 minutes.<br /><br />The story of an educated and compassionate man named William Wilberforce who champions the cause of abolition of slavery is shown in his English culture.<br /><br />The acting and cinematography and musical score are very well done.<br /><br />Further, the special features of contemporary slavery is moving and revelatory as well as the commentary with the director and actors.<br /><br />Will watch this one many times and have been moved to buy some biographies of Wilberforce and you might want to as well.<br /><br />More movies like this!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This is the ultimate cd to discover jimi hendrix. Almost all of his styles are covered: from the psychadelic riffs of purple haze to the utterly beautiful magic of little wing, to the frantic battleground-influenced noises of the star spangled banner. This disc covers it all. But there is one drawback: You will buy this album, listen to it, and then want to purchase his entire discography ;)
B000VWE5OY|1.0|Very rollercoaster. Characters have much potential that was, for the most part, unrealized in the first season. Too dependent on having seen all the episodes of Doctor Who in which the lead character Jack appears, as well as random monsters, unexplained \\"voids\\", and time rifts. Add to that the fact that there's apparently a whole library of books about Torchwood and you get a big jumble of characters and events jumping centuries as well as out of sequence. Whom the Gods wish to destroy the first call \\"promising!\\"    Don't waste you money or time. You'll simply never catch up....
B000001ELL|3.0|I have always written \\"Dynasty\\" off as the Kiss \\"disco\\" album, and only recently went back for another listen....boy was I WRONG! Sure, \\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\\" has a \\"disco\\" rhythm (Gene was working overtime plucking that bassline!!!), but you know what, it's still a great tune. And even if you don't like \\"I Was Made...\\" the rest of the disk is classic Kiss. The Rolling Stones cover, \\"2,000 Man\\" is really good. \\"Charisma\\" is a great tune, I've had the chorus running through my head for two days now! \\"Hard Times\\" is another classic, hard driving rock tune. So if you were like me, thinking this was a \\"disco\\" record, rest assured, Kiss didn't give up their rock roots on \\"Dynasty\\".
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I had this album back when it was first released and I loved it then.  UFO shows why they are one of the best Heavy Metal bands ever!!  Saw them live and its just like the concert. A must have for any UFO or Heavy Metal fan of the 70's and 80's.
1589269063|3.0|This book describes how to identify and meet each others needs. However I would like to propose something radical and perhaps counterintuitive. Namely, meeting each other's needs is not the path to an extraordinary relationship. Our needs can be many and the fulfilling of our needs (if it is even possible) will not lead to extraordinary love. Instead, let's put our needs aside and seek a spiritual and emotional togetherness. Does that sound vague? Then please read William Martin's \\"The Couple's Tao Te Ching\\".  If you want more than incremental improvement in your relationship, read Martin's book. For those who have ears to hear, let them hear.
B000LE0TGA|5.0|A great CD by ELO. In my opinion, one of the best this group has to offer.<br />Every song is good on this album and you will find yourself singing along with it before long. Thunder and Lightning is a song that I could not find on any of the greatest hits. ELO recently redid this album and added a few small tracks also. If you are an ELO fan, its a great buy!!
B000TSUCAQ|4.0|My 7 year old son had checked this book out of the school library (where it is very popular) as well as our public library.  I was pleased to find it available from Amazon and he was thrilled to get it.  He loves looking at it and we've made a few things from it.  It's cute and creative.
B0002WYS6S|4.0|This is a great prog rock DVD. I even enjoyed the Train Wreck of Thought songs being that they picked the best from that cheesy CD. The band sounds tight and the song choice is right on. Portnoy is a phenom and Rhudess is unique on the keys. Myung is incredible on the bass and reminds one of RanBroad of the late 80s in the prog band Hoax. One star docked for the endless wankarama disease that haunted the Hoax in the Miter Vaque ERA. But, overall, I think this is a fine DVD and it passes my rather strict guidelines on DVDs. The bottom line is that this is entertaining. \\"As I am\\" starts the show well highlighted by Hollow Years and some great moments from the classic \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\".
B0009SOFFY|5.0|The good folks at Amazon need to list this as one of their \\"Essential Recordings\\".  This cd rocks harder and better than anything I have ever heard .. it just doesn't get any better than this.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|The movie is great bought it for my grandchildren. Only problem was I could have purchased it at the local walmart with tax less expensive and would have had it the day it was released.
B000001E3L|5.0|Not \\"Too Late To Stop Now\\", but awesome for a collaborative effort. \\"In The Garden/You Send Me/Allegheny\\" is worth the price of the CD alone but there are many more smokin' performances. This far surpasses \\"Live at the Grand Opera House Belfast\\" IMO. Definitely worth picking up for any Van fan.
B000UR366S|1.0|Although so young in age, her lyrics revealed an intellect & wisdom that captured & exposed the hope of the times, and yet here, only the sadness of her age shines.  I hope that she will do one more album, one that discovers and reveals the wonders of this time, as she did for those past. But the voice, I still love the voice, it takes me back to 35 years ago.  Ahh, clouds in my coffee...oh yea, that was the cute one.
0525950079|3.0|I'll start by saying that there is no sense in comparing this book to Pillars of the Earth. I read Pillars many years ago and enjoyed it immensely, but I can't say I remember what it was I liked about it.  That being said, after reading World Without End, I wonder if Pillars was actually as good as I thought it was.  World Without End is basically a trashy romance novel set in a historic context. Yes, there are several very interesting plot lines, and yes I did care about the characters, but some of the writing is just plain bad.  There are sexual scenes that do not add to the story...there is language that I'm sure was not appropriate to the time...I mean its a fun read, but its just not that good.  I guess the best thing about it is that my bicep size has probably increased a little just from lifting and holding the book.
B00005JPNW|5.0|The special effects and the cinematography of \\"The Golden Compass\\" are wonderful, but it's the subtext that really shines through, making for one of the most unique, fascinating, and entertaining fantasy films of recent memory. Just as it is in the film, the plot of Philip Pullman's original novel suggested that free will was kept under strict control. The film brings this idea to the surface and allows the audience to analyze it; in a parallel universe--in which a person's soul is separate and physically represented by an animal--a ruthless organization called the Magisterium tries to enforce rules against free will. Anyone who challenges its authority will be condemned as a heretic. Because they wanted to ensure total compliance, the Magisterium sought to destroy every last alethiometer, or golden compass--a magical, watch-like mechanism that literally tells the truth by pointing at strange symbols.    The one alethiometer that survived is now in the possession of Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), a college professor who defies the Magisterium by confirming the existence of dust. I'm not referring to the allergy-inducing particles that settle on ordinary surfaces; I'm referring to the magical substance that's somehow related to a rift between their universe and ours. Because this has put him at odds with the Magisterium, he gives the alethiometer to his orphaned niece, Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), a young girl raised by the professors at a university. Lyra, who absolutely hates being called a lady, is clever, bold, and incredibly headstrong, with an adventurous spirit that occasionally gets her into trouble. Her spirit--or daemon, as referred to by the characters--is Pan (voiced by Freddie Highmore), who hasn't quite decided which animal form to take. He spends most of his time as a ferret, but he also turns into a cat, a bird, and a mouse.    When Lyra hears that her uncle is traveling to the snowy north to find the dust and open this cross-dimensional rift, she wishesto join him. Asriel refuses to let her, and he warns her against speaking of dust to anyone. Here enters Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), the wicked, controlling head of the Magisterium; she quickly learns that the alethiometer is in Lyra's possession and vows to reclaim it by tricking Lyra onto her good side. Mrs. Coulter's true nature is soon revealed, and upon escaping, Lyra is put under the protection of the Gyptians, a band of rebels who were once aided by Lord Asriel. As they journey north with Lyra, she also meets: Serafina (Eva Green), an elegant, almost ethereal witch; Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott), a grizzled pilot who speaks like a Texan from the Old West; and Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen), a disgraced polar bear who was once a great warrior among an entire clan of polar bears. To rid himself of his shame, he decides to reclaim his stolen armor and protect Lyra at whatever cost.    This is pretty much the foundation for the adventure that follows, an adventure so big that it isn't over even when the movie ends. But in the grand scheme of things, the adventure is fairly superficial and only part of what makes it so wonderful; \\"The Golden Compass\\" is just as thought provoking as it is enjoyable, filled to the brim with intelligent, meaningful undertones. This isn't to say that the film exists entirely as one big commentary--a good portion of it functions at a level of pure entertainment, from the convincing special effects to the stunning set designs to the fantastic mechanical creations. The story is not one of the future, the past, or even the present; its unique setting has essentially made any sense of time meaningless. And let's not forget a number of lighthearted moments between Lyra and her best friend, Roger (Ben Walker), both of whom are more like bonded siblings.    But there is a dark side to this story. For one thing, the Magisterium is involved in a sinister plot to kidnap children and sever the connections between them and their daemons.The sooner they lose their spirits (pun definitely intended), the quicker they can be controlled. There's also a general sense of foreboding that runs through the entire film, as if to say that certain things are not as simple as they may first appear. Consider the fact that a person's physical pain is also felt by his or her daemon, and vice versa: What exactly will happen if one of them dies? Can one exist without the other? And how exactly are daemons a threat to free will?    The fact that I'm asking these questions is a good thing, because it proves that \\"The Golden Compass\\" is a stimulating film. Rarely is a fantasy story allowed to transcend the limiting clichés of princesses, castles, dragons, swords, and predictable Hero's Journeys. Here's a film that actually brings something new to the genre, something fresh, exciting, daring, and determined. This is not a mind-numbing rehash; it's a thoroughly original experience, highlighted by delightful performances, a solid structure, and a well-rounded social commentary. I suppose I should make a note about the Catholic Church's poor reception of this film, but why bother? Religion--or lack thereof--has nothing to do with it. It has everything to do with being engaging, smart, and imaginative.
0765357151|3.0|This started as an interesting lone-survivor/end of the world story. I was disappointed at the lack of any \\"End of the World\\" feeling or story. The author missed an opportunity.<br /><br />I quickly grew bored with Neville's sniveling and drinking.<br /><br />There were lots of things in the story that were unclear. The twist at the end was a surprise. In fact, so surprising that I'm not sure what happened.<br /><br />I was annoyed to find that it was a novella (about 160 pages) with a collection of short stories. The novella, I am Legend, was why I bought the book. I read the first six short stories. They read like not quite complete Twilight Zone or Night Gallery episodes. I may read the rest of the stories eventually, but I was not interested enough to finish them now.<br /><br />I am Legend was a good enough story, but the telling of it had holes. The writing was uninspired.<br /><br />As mediocre as this book was, it was worlds better than \\"The Road.\\"
B000W4KT64|5.0|I loved the movie, and this whole DVD, and CD of the soundtrack gets you right back in the early 60's.....you thrill to the music, the beat, the changing times.  I was inspired by Queen Latifah's strong loving role as Motormouth Maybelle, and her son Seaweed are a mighty twosome.  Nikki Blonksy gives a great performance, hard to believe she is a first timer!  John Travolta steal every scene he is in and Christopher Walken, I am no longer afraid of him!  His tender love for his wife and daughter, plus his talented acting skills.
140120306X|2.0|The first two volumes of LoEG were remarkable. This third volume, though, is merely bland. Alan Moore abandons the traditional elements of story-telling -- most notably, the concept of beginning, middle, and end -- and replaces them with a montage of jigsaw-like literary references that the reader is expected to piece together unaided. The whole thing devolves merely into an intellectual exercise. Who is that character carrying an umbrella? And which early-20th-century book did that guy in the cape first appear in? Bereft of any real plot, other than a desultory chase that runs the length of the book, and confronted with endless indexing exercises, the reader is ultimately left feeling, sad to say, bored. The 3D portion of the book is interesting in a gimmicky sort of way, but even there the novelty fades quickly, inspiring only bemused confusion from the panoply of random events, characters, and tedious narrations. My advice to you is: if you haven't read the first two volumes, then be sure to get 'em both, because they are fabulous -- but avoid this third-volume clunker.
B00005JPLW|1.0|Quick movie synopsis:  A bunch of angry, alpha male, insecure and inadequate white boys who weren't hugged enough by their mothers hating life and eachother, spreading their germ of hate across the world for some quick power and ego boosting. Ug Ug ooga ooga bang on your chest and find a cliff.  I wish all these macho fools would just shut up and go have a good cry under a palm tree.   Who finds this crap entertaining, probably the lowest common denominator of a human being?  And why bother using live action, 300 looked like a cartoon.  A mess of a movie for the planet of the apes.
0757302661|5.0|If you're pregnant, you MUST read this book! It will get you mentally, physically and emotionally ready to enjoy your labor... rather than fear it. The mind is a VERY powerful tool and the more we understand the natural physiological process of childbirth, the better we can work WITH our bodies and make the whole process easy and as painless as possible (literally!). I was skeptical when I picked up this book, but it really works! When you remove the element of fear (and the hormones that are produced by fear & stress) and replace them with endorphins, pain is literally, physically lessened! Because of having read this book, my labor was an amazing, totally natural, drug-free experience. I focused on staying completely relaxed and letting my body do what it needed to do, and I had a 6-hour labor with very minimal pain. It was amazing. Thank you Marie Mongan for giving me a wonderful childbirth!
B000VNMMR0|2.0|This is one of those films that is almost unwatchable for a second viewing.  You get the point from start to finish, I don't know anyone in their right mind who would watch this a second time or buy it and own it no less.  It's ok for superficial entertainment value, ONLY IF you are extremely bored.  The story is just cut and paste, interchagable conspriacy, government secrets and cover up espionage humdrum, recylcled garbage we've all seen in hundreds of other films.  The repeating of the same actions and expecting different results in the end.  We have the stereotypical Lucy Lui type asain karate spy champion attached to her white master.  A souless portrayal now that's entertainment.  Bruce Willis at least had some snappy dialogue, the only good part of the movie for me.  I wonder what kind of people find these type of movies enjoyable.  The masses seem to love this stuff.  One last footnote, I worked on this film as movie extra and they treated us like garbage, and that's not why I'm hating on it. I just think it's a crappy movie.
B000VJAICK|5.0|Now this is what High Definition is all about.I was very Pleased with the \\"Picture Quality\\" on the \\"Tremors\\" HD DVD.The image makes you think you are watching a 2007 movie release.The picture is awesome.
B000002VFW|5.0|When all else fails, put Lisa in.  I can't believe after all these years and I still play this cd.  It's always like a breathe of fresh air when you get sick of every other kind of music.  I remember hearing \\"All Around The World\\" for the first time on the radio in 1990.  It had that then popular thumping \\"soul to soul\\" type beat that was the definitive sound of the evoluton of house music. \\"All Around The World\\" and \\"Poison\\" by BellBiv Devoe were the pop jams during this time and brings back the best of times for me.  My all time favourite song is \\"You Can't Deny It\\" on the cd.  To this day I still love hearing it.  I can play this whole cd from start to finish and it sends you that good vibe everytime.  \\"Affection\\" is one of my fave cds and it's a classic.
B000VD5I94|3.0|I have a very nice collection of movies on Blu-ray now & still growing (Many Thanks to Amazon ...the Best online store ever!!!) The Picture Quality on the blu-ray movie \\"Robocop\\" was a little grainy & I was very disappointed.However,I'll keep it because it just happens to be a favorite of mine & Blu-ray is the Best Format for movies.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|It would be going out on a limb saying this one of the best movies ever made? Or at least the most unusual, mystical movies ever made.  It has everything, action, comedy, drama, dance musical.  It takes you into this bizarre world that is so surreal, sometimes dream sometimes nightmare.  It climaxes into this unbelievable frenzy that leaves you bewildered and almost powerless to it's grip.
B000WQ9UA8|2.0|As a fan since the time Britney came out, I have all her albums and followed her carrer. I did my very best to try to not think of her personal life during the making of this album but I can't help to inculde it because I feel like that's part of the reason why this album to me really didn't strike me to be made with thought and fully focus. I only have three favorite songs on this album which is \\"Gimme More\\" \\"I Got A Plan (Let's Get Naked)\\" \\"Ohh, Ohh, Baby\\" To start, this ain't no \\"In The Zone\\" I thought that album had everything a grown Spears was. This album seems to really derail. I think that she really didn't put much effort into making it. My feeling is she just made it to keep her fan base alive and not lose them to her many flops in the magazines. Personally, It really didn't keep me interested. I really wish she would have waited until her personal life was ok to come with a strong album that had lots of focus. I really hope she gets better and comes back to the Britney we all knew and loved. I still am a fan cheering for her :)
B000007MVD|4.0|As a Beatles fan of many years, I wondered about this collection and had lots of questions.  Sound quality?  Turns out it isn't too bad, overall, and is better than I thought it would be.  Would it be songs and lots of chatter, or less chatter?  Turns out that the CD is 99% songs, with really very little chatter.  This CD shows how the Beatles, in their early years anyway, were real chameleons.  They covered any song that struck their fancy, be it country, rock and roll, or whatever.  They were just getting started, really, as songwriters.  At this stage in the game they were apparently HIGHLY imitative.  Many of the songs they covered were, word for word, note for note, sigh for sigh, total copies of the originals.  One real nice surprise is the number of songs sung by George in those days.  His voice was really pleasant, and had some bottom to it instead of the thin reedy voice we were often treated to in later recordings. Bottom line is...if you are a Beatles fan, this CD is for you.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I love the show, but I had to exchange the box set twice and I still haven't got one that is totally alright.  About 20 episodes will not play.  They play the intro, but instead of going to the Friends theme song it just stops. This was very frustrating for me since many of the episodes that wouldn't play were ones I really wanted to watch, like Monica and Chandler's wedding.  This isn't Amazon's fault, it is the manufacturers fault.  The lady I talked to on the phone about this problem said that the whole batch of Friends DVD's they had currently, were all probably defective and said I should wait at least 15 days to order a new one.  This is the first time I have ever had any sort of problem with a product I ordered from Amazon.
B00000J2KR|4.0|This work is a beautiful production. The scenery, costumes and lighting are superb. Admittedly, some of the situations and clothing are rather comical viewed from the 21st century, and I spent much of the time on the verge of laughing. I enjoyed most of the story. It just keeps getting better and better -- until the intermission. Why does this young man suddenly begin behaving in an utterly atrocious manner? He wasn't a saint to begin with, but I had hoped for some kind of redemption as his life progressed. Guess I should have read the book. I would like to see the whole last part where he becomes a better person. That would be just too Hollywood and not true to the novel. So it should remain as it stands after all. In my rewatching of the DVD I just turn it off when the intermission comes. But I do watch it again and again.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|If ever there was a movie that exposed drug addiction for the horror that it truly is, this is that film.  `Requiem for a Dream' is understandably a very hard film to watch.  Everything from its intense subject matter to its sporadic and chaotic direction is set to either draw you in or push you away.  I don't think there can be an in between for this film.  You either love it wholeheartedly or you loathe it and consider it a waste of time.  It's a film that will leave you feeling dirty, feeling depressed and maybe even feeling bad about yourself but I feel that in the right context these are all good feelings for us to have because they force us to consider things we may never make the time to consider.<br /><br />Drug addiction is painted in most films as devastating but beatable, something that can ruin lives but can be overcome.  In so many movies today we watch our main character suffer at the hands of his addiction only to watch him rise above and overcome the adversary, turning over a new leaf and moving forward on a new path.  If that is what you are expecting to see then be forewarned, there are no happy endings to be found in `Requiem...'.  In fact, `Requiem for a Dream' paints this picture so harshly, so unsympathetically one is forced to realize that not all addictions are beatable.  Sometimes, well, most of the time there is no coming back.  The reason I feel that `Requiem for a Dream' is such an important film is because it shows the audience the ugly truth behind a very common and widespread problem.  You won't walk away from this movie and think lightly of the occasional drug run.  You won't think that there's nothing wrong with a high here or there.  You will be repulsed by the very idea of a manufactured euphoria and will cringe at the thought of ending up like any of the characters portrayed in this film.<br /><br />This film is designed to prevent drug abuse.<br /><br />The film follows the lives of four individuals all connected to one another.  You have Sara Goldfarb, an elderly lady who lives really for nothing except the off chance that she could be on television.  She watches her game shows and thinks of nothing else.  Her son Harry is so dependant of drugs that he's willing to steal his mother's belongings to get the money for a high.  His best friend Tyrone is just as guilty and his girlfriend Marion is along for the ride.  The film follows each of their addictions (Sara becomes addicted to diet pills in an attempt to lose enough weight to fit in a dress she's determined to wear on television) and fleshes out the pain, degradation and hopelessness each addiction leaves it's host in.<br /><br />What helps propel this film along is the stellar performances by the entire cast, most notably its two leading ladies.  Ellen Burstyn rightfully was awarded a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars for her brilliant portrayal of Sara.  She really gets inside this woman and makes her delusions so real to the audience.  She takes something that could have, in the wrong hands, gone camp or been comical and makes it so raw and emotionally stimulating.  Her pain is essentially our pain and this makes the film so much more real to us.  Jennifer Connelly is flawlessly stunning as Marion Silver.  Her character has such a subtle yet moving arch towards the closing of the film when we watch her desperation grow to the point of no return.  It's heartbreaking but also extremely realistic.  Jared Leto is also remarkable here.  He has a lot of misses as an actor but when he hits it he hits it out of the park.  His portrayal of Harry is emotional and resilient.  Marlon Wayans blew me away.  I didn't know he had this in him, but he succeeds with flying colors at making his character real and moving.  I still can't get over this performance, so utterly unexpected.<br /><br />A lot has been said for Aronofsky's visionary style.  I'm going to say a little bit now.  His direction of this film is a perfect compliment to the subjectand depiction he was going for.  The chaotic editing helps keep the audience in the right frame of mind, further embellishing the mental state of our protagonists.  As we watch the screen shift back and forth violently with each depiction of drug intake we get the sense that this is really destroying the characters from the inside out.  Aronofsky expressed brilliant judgment in his decisions while making this film.<br /><br />So, like I mentioned earlier, this is not a film for everyone.  It is brutal in many ways and very hard to watch both emotionally and visually if you are not prepared for it.  If you can sit through this masterpiece though I highly recommend it because it's a film unlike any other and one that we all should take notice of.and depiction he was going for.

B000VSBX34|5.0|I saw this movie as a kid numerous times, and it was always an event for my brother and I when it came on TV. The VHS release was pretty murky looking, and so was the MPI DVD release. This one looks pretty damn good. Even better is the outstanding audio quality. I've never heard these HELP! songs sound cleaner, fresher or clearer. I highly recommend for the Beatle fan.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|La cantidad de material incluida en esta edición es impresionante, algunas incluso vesiones del público, lo que es impagable. Por la misma razon algunos videos no tienen una excelente calidad, pero eso no empaña en absoluto esta entrega. Las entrevistas incluidas, entregan de primera fuente la historia del grupo.    La edición es para coleccionistas, los tres discos, tickets de conciertos históricos, adhesivos, el book, el póster (donde la fecha del concierto coincide con mi cumpleaños ;) ), todo esto en una caja de primera.    Para un fan de AC/DC es un material imprescindible, una verdadera joya.
9562911640|5.0|Having just recently been introduced to the writings of Charles Haanel, I cannot recommend his Master Key System enough. After going through the book and exercises once(and benefiting greatly), I am reading through again. I have recommended it to several people close to me and have seen very positive changes in their own lives. As individuals, we are solely responsible for the direction and success (or lack thereof) in  life. The process begins through concentrated, focused thought. Haanel teaches us  how that works and how to accomplish whatever our objectives might be.This is one of the most important works of literature I have ever read.       For  anyone who feels a lack of control or direction in their life-- this is a must read. Be blessed!

B000002KXV|5.0|Donald Fagen is without a doubt one of the most underrated performers and song composers in the world today.  His brilliant and wonderful songs in Steely Dan are often looked over by the masses due to lack of major tours or major airplay since the heads in charge decide that the material is too weird for most people to get, so it was just easier to pass on them.<br /><br />The Nightfly, his first of so far three solo albums apart from long time collaborating chum Walter Becker present the genius without the bewilderment of the songs.  No strange lyrics about roulades that can't be sung or whats in the gladstone bag or what Katy lied about.  The songs are simple and the lyrics while lacking the wonder retain their story telling, which is something that Steely Dan songs had in spades.<br /><br />Fagen cheats a bit here as he does in the liner notes of his other solo albums and informs the listener where hes coming from in these songs, these are the thoughts he may have been thinking about as a young lad growing up.  The foodpill and flying car future era that we never got encompasses the wonderful hit IGY, finding that special girl while you wait for the \\"Reds to push the button down\\" in New Frontier, or the title track in which a lonely man on a midnight shift radio stations plays his favorite jazz songs with conversation, from the foot of Mt. Belzoni which is almost a summery of Fagens career, a man who has great songs to play if someone who wants to listen to them have the compassion and time to stay up and listen.<br /><br />Short of being well, too short at just about 30 minutes or so, The Nightfly is easily the most compressible of any of the work that Fagen has put out, Steely Dan or otherwise and while the fun of deciphering the lyrics may be gone, that means we can put our emphasis on enjoying the songs.
B000VSBX34|5.0|This is a great movie.  It's not \\"A Hard Days Night\\", but it's funny and has the Beatles, in color!  It has some really great scenes like the boys recording \\"I Need You\\" and \\"The Night Before\\" on the Salsbury Plain surrounded by the Royal British Army.  Huh?  \\"Go to the window...go to the window...\\"  Kooky, corny but...it's the Beatles.  I particularly like the boys doing \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\".  Not to mention an entire pub and football stadium singing the chorale to \\"the famous Beethoven's famous Ninth Symphony\\".  Much for your money.  Worth every penny, considering it had recently listed for upwards of $100.00  For me it was a miracle; an answer to my prayers that they re-released it!
B000VSBX34|4.0|The film transfer is pristine, there is no beef there.  The audio on the songs which is supposed to be 5.1 is a fake 5.1 where the rear channels are used as a delay.  Let me explain...According to The Beatles Recording Sessions by Mark Lewisohn virtually all of the generations of the earlier recordings (Help were some of the first four track) were saved.  These could have been linked up in ProTools to create a new multi track master and a much better 5.1 could have been achieved than the one where the rear channels were just delay.  Giles Martin remixed things for \\"Love\\"...why not do it for the movies...it just makes sense.  The recent Genesis remixes in 5.1 are great examples of the way 5.1 COULD be used.  I would like to see much more of that in the marketplace.  That is my \\"tech\\" take on the situation.  I am so glad they restored the video however.  My old VHS was getting very tired.  So I shall just have to settle for fake 5.1.  Obviously one cannot do anything with a mono movie soundtrack except delays to create a fake 5.1.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Few directors are as divisive as Michelangelo Antonioni, best known as creator of the 1961 L'AVVENTURA and the 1966 BLOW UP, both of which present largely unresolved mysteries in order to make thematic statements.  In the case of BLOW UP, which is easily Antonioni's best English-language film, the unresolved story is one of a possible murder captured by accident on film; the themes involved are those of reality, illusion, and the distractions that prevent us from seeing the difference between the two.<br /><br />Thomas (David Hemmings) is an obnoxious, self-centered London photographer who alternates between fashion and art photography.  In search of a tranquil subject to counterpoint an otherwise dark collection of photographs, he takes several photographs of a couple in an otherwise empty park---and is unconcerned when the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) pursues him to his to studio to demand the negatives.  Thomas agrees to give them to her, but secretly switches rolls of film; later, when he develops the photographs, he is startled to find he may have photographed a murder.<br /><br />The film is perhaps most memorable for its disturbing sense of irony.  Near the beginning of the film Thomas is plagued by two would-be models; he escapes them by visiting an antique shop and then wanders into the nearby park.  As the film progresses, he finds his meeting with the unwillingly-photographed woman interrupted by the delivery of a purchase he made at that antique shop; still later, and now aroused by the mysterious woman, he is once more visited by the would-be models and has sex with them---an incident that delays his inspection of the photographs and effectively derails him from receiving assistance from various friends who are now themselves distracted by sex and drugs.  Each detail coils back upon itself in a series of frustrating interruptions, driving Thomas in directions that repeatedly delay any action he might take that could answer his questions, much less solve the riddle.<br /><br />The greatest irony is that we are watching pictures of a photographer taking pictures, and indeed much of the film involves looking at pictures of pictures of pictures without any clear indication of whether or not anything we see is actually real---which is, of course, exactly the nature of the illusion a movie creates.  That said, if you come to film expecting a murder mystery with a neatly explained solution, you are in for a rude shock: BLOW UP is not \\"about\\" plot; it is about how difficult it is to know anything factual from a medium that is intrinsically illusionary in the first place.  Not only is the nature of film as a medium the movie's greatest irony, it is also probably it's ultimate statement.<br /><br />BLOW UP really is a film that tends to jack people's jaws all over the place, partly because it defeats their expectations in terms of character and plot, but more specifically because it is so open-ended that you can pretty much impose any meaning upon it that you like.  Was there a man with a gun---or was it just a trick of the light?  Was there a murder---or was it something else?  And if so, what?  And what does it all mean at the end?  But there are no fixed \\"meanings\\" in the film at all, and if you want a strong storyline with clear-cut ideas, well, you're out of luck here.  So no, BLOW UP isn't a film for every one.  It will most greatly appeal to people with a fondness for European cinema and art movies.<br /><br />The DVD presently available is at best acceptable; it would be really nice to see this film given the royal treatement by a company such as Criterion.  In any case, recommended to as a masterpiece of the \\"art house\\" kind.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewergreatest irony is that we are watching pictures of a photographer taking pictures, and indeed much of the film involves looking at pictures of pictures of pictures without any clear indication of whether or not anything we see is actually real---which is, of course, exactly the nature of the illusion a movie creates.

0143038419|1.0|It is hard for me as a Blak Womyn to understand what it is that gives white women the right to appropriate spirituality. I've read this book and find that she is not saying anything new. Everybody knows she's not saying anything new. I find it amazing that a privileged white supremacist feminine patriarch has been on Oprah. I will no longer watch Oprah. The show is not for me in the first place. It's for white women. White women have taken the reigns of white supremacy in its \\"evolved form\\" from white men and have made a bee-line to whatever safehaven Blak Womyn had in Spirit.<br />First white women and men, abhored Christianity because their attempt to use it as a tool of oppression back fired on them. Now this \\"New Age\\" bull corn has been gaining popularity. The spear-headers are whites and so-called jews.<br />What whites are running from is taking responsibility for their continued oppression of Blak Womyn. Black men are O.K. and have been for some time because they've taken the master's language and expressed openly their contempt for Blak Womyn. Look at Antwone Fisher.<br />I have been on a spiritual journey to rid myself of white supremacist thought, actions, and words. No one thinks it's important though.<br />What makes this woman who seems to be self deprecating and humble. Her cander is just to pull you in. There is a distinct tone of arrogance in the writing. How can a racist white woman receive God's love? I don't believe it is possible. I beleive whites are grasping for straws out of a fear they don't understand but know why it's there.<br />This book was nothing more than exploitation of other cultures spirituality. I liked how she talked about the Indian girl Tilsa as if she were a perculiar object.<br />What I remember is that america has always pondered the god question because innate need to steal, kill, and destroy. You have to ease the dissonance by telling and convincing everyone that what you did was right.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I recieved my Friends Complete Collection today! I'm so excited, I've already watched a few of my favorites.    One of my concerns was something I caught on one of the discussion boards (on this page).. about ending up with a missing disc, and having a replica of another instead. Luckily, that didn't happen :)    All the episodes are in order, from the very first to the very last. Subtitles are an option.    The box I have here is slightly dented on one of the top corners, there is an extremely minor tear I saw on the box as well, and one of the corners of the booklet is a little bent. But overall, I'm very happy with the product to be honest. As long as the discs are okay. Nobody would notice the (very) slight wear.    The discs I've viewed so far work perfectly.  The collection does include some bonus features. The booklet is helpful. In case anyone is wondering?.. It's a horizontal folder-sized booklet with a picture of the inside of the empty coffee house on it. The back has the apartment with everyone in it. The booklet has a description of each main character inside it and several pictures throughout. The booklet is divided in sections by season.      The overall red box's top (the part that opens) isn't locked in some way to shut close. It opens and closes freely. I had an idea about hot gluing a piece of ribbon and a button for the ribbon to close on. (Since it doesn't overlap to velcro it). Depends if I have that kind of extra time. Either way, it's fine the way it is.    There are six booklet-kind-of-holder/cases for the CDs. Some of you have heard that the CDs might get scratched by it's 'casing'. Each disc has it's individual place.. the material is like thick cardpaper.. and there's a somewhat gloss where the CD touches the paper in the insert. ..Hope that helps understand what it's like, better.    Anyways, I'm so glad it's finally here! Apparently if you're interested in the limited edition's \\"frosted\\" door box, it's availabe for about $20 on their site. I read about it on the limited edition's discussion board, just in case anyone is interested =)
079284131X|1.0|What a classic horror flick. And what a great way to screw it up. Full screen video, terrible audio, and a picture that makes my old VHS copy shine. No special features... I'd previously gotten the set that starts with the second movie, which is a very well thought-out set. From that to this. Bargain bin effort at best. I recommend waiting and hoping that they release at *least* a wide screen version in the states. Theres cheap software that will clean up the video and audio *for* MGM. They would barely have to lift a finger. Truly Disappointed. Truly, Truly.
B000VSBX34|5.0|HELP was an excellent movie when it first came out. All the energy and excitement I had when I first saw it was relived as I the experienced it all over again.
B00000AF98|5.0|Kiss's 1987 release has a number of songs that 80s pop rock fans feel they heard \\"somewhere\\". Yeah, that's produced by Ron Nevision at the helm of 80s pop rock albums such as Heart's 1984 self titled album and Survivor's 1984 hit album VITAL SIGNS. If you love the music of Survivor, Foreigner, Starship, Van Halen and Heart you will also love this CD. But for long time fans, I am not so sure.<br /><br />CRAZY CRAZY NIGHTS is wow just like SURVIVOR. I'LL FIGHT THE HELL TO HOLD YOU might fit better for HEART I think. BANG BANG YOU is really a pop anthem for KISS. NO NO NO is 100 percent kiss. Guitar riff is just excellent. MY WAY opens like VAN HALEN and extends like BON JOVI. My #1 favorite from this album. REASON TO BE has the very ballad style RON NEVISON loves. It has the best combination of Foreigner's I WANT TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS and HEART's WHAT ABOUT LOVE. TURN ON THE NIGHT is another highlight and Kiss made this pop anthem really well.<br /><br />Verdict: Full of \\"Heard-Somewheres\\" but excellently done.<br />Rating: 91 out of 100<br />Recommended for: 80s pop fans in general who is not familiar with metal works.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|For the Woody Allen Fans. As Woody prefer everything in B/W. It great in colorized color. Give it a freshness and this is a special pack with other feature. It work the money.
1582701709|4.0|Pop psych and pop spirituality books are hardy perennials anyway, but they flourish all the more in grim economic times (think Dale Carnegie). Be that as it may, people of various faiths or none will find a new spiritual dimension in \\"The Secret.\\" It is really a different way of prayer, one that is straight from traditions many of us know, but that for some reason we haven't looked at straight-on. Its \\"collage\\" approach of a lot of very brief writings and by celebrities whom I had never heard of gives it the feeling of a series of jacket blurbs, or an ad that takes forever to get to the point. It also abuses physics rather pathetically (just as we're finding out that the U.S. does even worse in science than we thought, I notice that neither the author nor her editor realized that in magnetism not like charges, but opposites, attract!) No matter, it still makes a very good overall point that we too easily overlook even though it's right in front of us. I think you can read this little book as a skeptic and it will still have a very positive effect on your life.
B0000029DD|2.0|Rarely am I drawn to an artist by one song alone, such is the case, when first hearing \\"Hallelujuh,\\" from the film \\"Edukators.\\" Outside that song, I feel I am listening to one of the most un-focused, undisciplined young men ever to draw a record contract.The wailing, sometimes heavenly voice, does not equate with monstrous talent. His guitar playing, so facile and engaging is ill-served by his undeveloped lyrics. I suppose he had the pedigree as the son of Tim Buckley. However, in my view, this promising genius needed a Norm Petty producer like Roy Orbison did to shape his lyrics commercially and met his tragic demise prematurely. His competition for limp presence and guitar threat today would be John Mayer, yet 2 stanzas of strong lyrics with more purposeful use of vocal range, would send his competition away. Only 3 songs on this CD had listening appeal for me. The rest were experimental efforts. Essentially, I think I'm listening here to band try-out from the House of Kerouac, where the production is top-notch, the band is sound, but the lyricist could not approach a drunk Jim Morrison.\\"Hallelujah\\" is the standout, primarily because the lyrics can stand alone.
B000244FDW|5.0|I have now three of the latest Pride and Prejudice video's.  I love all three with a passion.      Each are excellent, but I've got to admit, the 1980 version has become my favorite.  Jane is beautiful, Elizabeth is excellent.  Darcy is not a Colin Firth, but grows on you.  The book is followed fairly well.     Well worth putting into your collection, especially if you are a Jane Austen fan.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Lost Season 3 is better then Season 2, yet falls short of Season 1.  If you have never watched Lost before, I strongly urge you to watch the first two seasons before the third season or the show won't make sense.    Now, some people have problems with the first 6 episodes.  I don't think any of the episodes were bad or boring in any way, however, when the show returned from a three month hiatus it really hit it's stride.    This season introduced four new main chracters: Juliet Burke, a fertility doctor, Benjamin Linus, who was in severel episodes of Season 2, Nikki Fernadez, an actress before crashing on the Island, and   Paulo, Nikki's boyfriend.  Juliet and Ben are great, but Nikki and Paulo didn't get much screen time until their flashback episode, \\"Expose.\\"    There were plenty of classic episodes in Season 3: \\"The Cost Of Living\\" where Mr. Eko went on a quest which leads to disatorous events, \\"The Man From Tallahasse\\", which showed Locke, Kate, and Sayid rescuing a friend, \\"One of Us\\", where we get some valuable information on Juliet's past, and my personal favorite episode of Lost,\\"The Man Behind The Curtain\\", where Ben and Locke journey to see the myesterious Jacob.    I strongly urge you not to read spoilers for the season finale,\\"Through The Looking Glass\\".  The final five minutes will leave you stunned, trust me.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|While a shortened version of the BBC version, it followed the book fairly well and the cast was wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the video.  Wonderful period movies.    This one and others of Jane Austen actually had me reading more on the culture of the society for that period of time.
0440238609|5.0|Very complex, well-drawn characters, intricate and very innovative. Helps if you have read science fiction plus were raised on Grimm's Fairy Tales in the original (people die a lot in the originals)
B000BHN7D4|4.0|Anastacia, although overlooked in the U.S., is a force to reckon with worldwide on the charts.  Her songs have spawned hits worldwide with her rock driven radio friendly dance and pop selections.    Pieces of a Dream is a hits compilation that encompesses her first 3 albums of material.  The album delivers early chart topping hits like \\"I'm Outta Love\\" and \\"One Day In Your Life\\" her two biggest chart hits to date.  \\"Left Outside Alone\\" is a fusion of contemporary rock and dnace while \\"Sick and Tired\\" explores the end of a long-term relationship.    Even with all this, Anastacia is at her best with her new material including the beautiful title track to the album \\"Pieces of a Dream\\".  The song explores a past relationship and the dreams that it was built upon.    Overall a strong release by an overlooked artist in the West.
