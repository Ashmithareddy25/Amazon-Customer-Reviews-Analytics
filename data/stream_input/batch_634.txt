B000066C6Z|3.0|\\"Top Secret!\\" is a classic example of that wildly popular film genre, the \\"combination World War II spy movie and Elvis movie romance/ comedy/parody\\".  I'm being silly, but my dumb joke essentially sums up what's good and bad about this goofy romp: if you're familiar with the genres being raked over the coals in the movie, you'll have a good time.  If you're not so familiar with those types of films (in other words, if you're under 30 and only watch new stuff on TV), this movie will mostly leave you at sea.<br /><br />Myself, I'm not so old but DO like to watch a lot of old stuff on TV and DVD, so I had fun with the jokes and the sensibilities being mocked.  Having said that, though, I still would rank \\"Top Secret!\\" only somewhere in the middle of the Abrahams/Zucker film canon.  There just weren't enough laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of the gross jokes were a little too, well... gross (not that I was offended, just kinda nauseated).  On that last point, let me share a bit of advice: you might want to scoot the kids and pre-teens out of the room before you watch this movie, unless you feel like answering questions about the outrageously-in-bad-taste \\"marital aid\\" featured in the prison cell scene with Val Kilmer.  Or the \\"violation\\" scene when the two guys are wearing the cow suit.  I admit I'm chuckling a bit now as I think of those scenes (see, I'm not a prude), but I'm certainly glad it was just me and my wife in the room when we recently watched the film on DVD.<br /><br />Oh, and if you think MY comments about the movie are only lukewarm positive, wait'll you hear the commentary track.  The Abrahams/Zucker folks, though dropping a few affectionate comments here and there and admiring a sight gag or two, essentially hate the movie and wonder what they were thinking when they made it.  Myself, I think they were being a little harsh.  If you don't expect the world, \\"Top Secret!\\" is a tolerable and moderately entertaining bit of silliness.
B000ION79Y|1.0|As someone else has said, \\"Too bad there isn't a rating less than 1 star\\". <br /> <br />It's pretty bad when Segal is too self important or lazy (take your pick) to do the post edit audio dubs that are needed. To make it worse, they used at least 3 different voices for the voice overs. <br /> <br />I've been a Segal fan for years, but this is the last one of his films that I will waste my time watching. I'm just glad that I chose to rent it instead of buying it. <br /> <br />Overall, the whole movie is awful. From the bad acting to Segals pseudo, badly done fight scenes. In the last fight scene when Segal is fighting a female \\"bad guy\\", her wound keeps changing from her left to her right side. Looks like the editors fell asleep while they were trying to make heads or tails of this fiasco. <br /> <br />Can't believe that Sony actually allowed their name to be associated with this one.
B000002UAU|3.0|Let me start by stating that I have always been a Beatles fan, and to me they will always remain the best band of all time.  That being said, I don't know why everyone has always heaped so much praise on this album - to me it is not even in The Beatles top 5. <br />Would anyone listen to Fixing A Hole or She's Leaving Home if they were not by the Beatles?  Come on now, how good is Within You Without You or When I'm Sixty-Four?  Granted that Lucy In The Sky and A Day in the Life are pretty darn good and have held up well over the years & With A Little Help from My Friends is okay, but overall I rather listen to Rubber Soul, Abbey Road, or a lot of other Beatle albums before this one.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|What's up with all the trashing en bashing? I think Ms Stefani has delivered a pleasant album with much variation? You people ever heard from music growing on you? It seems like you want it instand and it must be the same as her previous album. NOT!! She's developing and exploring new alleys. Thumbs up for being brave and going her own way instead of pleasing fans who want the same things over and over again!!
B000J10ERO|3.0|Like 1978's \\"Superman\\", 2006's \\"Superman Returns\\" is more stately, grand, and admirable than truly exciting and fun. But, like the earlier film, those traits are more than enough to recommend it. In many ways, in fact, this film feels more like a remake of that first Christopher Reeve film than a quasi-continuation of the Reeve series.<br /><br />For example, \\"Superman\\" featured a plot centering around Lex Luthor's scheme to create a new West Coast of the United States. \\"Superman Returns\\" features a plot centering around Lex Luthor's scheme to create a new continent. \\"Superman\\" featured a sequence showing Superman being dumped into a swimming pool with a hunk of kryptonite chained around his neck, with him luckily being rescued by a woman who jumps into the water and removes the kryptonite from his person. \\"Superman Returns\\" features a sequence showing Superman being dumped into the ocean with a hunk of kryptonite jammed into his side, with him luckily being rescued by a woman who jumps into the water and removes the kryptonite from his person. The former film shows Supes rescuing Lois from a helicopter mishap. The new film shows Supes rescuing Lois from a jetliner mishap. In other words, in classic remake fashion, the new film just upped the ante and created fancier versions of those earlier scenes. So, if you don't mind that approach (and especially if you liked the earlier film), you shouldn't have much of a problem here.<br /><br />Of course, \\"Superman Returns\\" doesn't completely take the remake approach. It also functions as sort of quasi-sequel, making it clear that to some extent the events of the earlier films happened to this new Superman we're seeing. I say \\"quasi-sequel\\" because director Brian Singer seems to pick and choose among the details of the earlier mythology, keeping some and discarding others. For example, it's acknowledged in the new film that Superman and Lois did indeed have a previous relationship, but it's pretty clear that it likely didn't happen exactly as depicted in the Donner/Lester films. If it DID happen pretty much the way we remember way back when (especially in \\"Superman II\\"), the NEXT Singer/Routh film will need a scene like this to smooth over all the plot contortions:<br /><br />Supes: I'm sorry for everything. You must have been pretty confused when you found yourself... expecting. I, uh, made you sort of forget that we ever... became close.<br /><br />Lois: Yes... I remembered the feelings, the emotions, the fact that we had a connection... but, yeah... I didn't remember that we, uh... you know.<br /><br />Supes: So, what did you think when...?<br /><br />Lois: Actually, I guess I have you to thank for me not going crazy wondering what happened to me. Now that I know the truth about Jason, as far as I can guess... your, uh, alien DNA or whatever- mixing with my human DNA- resulted in a pregnancy that took well over a year to come to term. And I didn't show for the longest time. Another side effect of our... \\"hybrid union\\", I guess. So, by the time it WAS clear I was pregnant, I had long since been dating Richard and just thought the baby was his. Honestly, I wasn't trying to hide anything from you.<br /><br />Supes: I know. But what do we do now?<br /><br />But we'll let the film writers finish up the above scenario if they choose to do so in the next \\"Superman\\" installment... \\"Superman Returns Again\\", perhaps? My point is, even though I hope the next chapter is more of a fun roller coaster ride where Superman really lets loose, the quirky remake/sequel nature- and ultimately \\"tribute\\" nature- of \\"Superman Returns\\" does result in a movie that is never less than interesting. And, yes, the movie does have its exciting sequences, too, even if some of those sequences are laced with those same pesky illogical quirks that plagued the exciting moments from the first film. But those are a whole other set of quibbles.<br /><br />So, just get the DVD (the two-disc version with all the extra features is quite well done) and sit back and enjoy the movie. Just do yourself a favor and leave your keen sense of scrutiny off to the side for later, like for when you're doing your tax returns or editing your Master's Thesis. Because, if you just try to relax and have fun with \\"Superman Returns\\", chances are you'll do just that.lf a favor and leave your keen sense of scrutiny off to the side for later, like for when you're doing your tax returns or editing your Master's Thesis.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|Seedy, risqu&eacute;, racy, raunchy, immoral, and adult oriented, but undeniably a masterpiece.  The direction, costuming, choreography, musical score, and acting are as good as it gets.  Some may fault this film for subject matter, but not for artistry.  Because of its themes, this film will not be for everyone.  I am amazed that such a gritty slice of life could be portrayed in a PG format.  Once seen, Joel Grey's perfomance cannot be forgotten.
B000J103PC|3.0|... flawed by its inclusion of the usual cliches - missing significant other's birthday party because the boss needs you to do something actually relatively important, for instance - what kind of a choice is that? Does that really show that the protaganist is circling the drain? What is she supposed to choose? Is Hollywood insane? The self-righteous friends and requisite token minorities are also included. Except for the Asian contingent. They need to complain more, I suppose.<br /><br />But it's an otherwise entertaining look at the world of fashion and fashion publishing, with Streep as a driven taskmaster whose every whim is catered to. This she plays to perfection. Stanley Tucci is endearing as the mentor figure. And the part of the \\"number one\\" aide is played to comedic perfection, especially a hilarious head-shaking response.
B0002O06N0|4.0|Imagine the Rolling Stones up to and including Let It Bleed mixed with the White Stripes but with a soulfull lead singer that channels late sixties, early seventies rock vocal stylings. Now add some fuzzed out bluesy guitar and slide and you'd have an approximation of the Black Keys' sound. They have just the right amount of \\"slop\\" to their sound, ie any more and they would stink, any less and they wouldn't be as charming. But really the best thing about these guys is the songwriting which is emotional and melodic with a good amount of bluesy grit and feel. This is rock before it was called \\"classic\\". The only thing that mars the cd is the crappy, er, \\"lo-fi\\" recording, but what do you want from two guys from Ohio who recorded in a rubber factory? This is the first recording I've heard by these guys and I'm convinced, good stuff.
0812550706|4.0|Once in a great while something new comes along that one could compare to the classics of its genre.  Ender's Game is one such book with its likeness to Heinlein's Starship Troopers.  Yet though it may draw such comparisons in its likeness, it is still unique and original.  The subsequent books of the series are also quite enjoyable and provide solid science fiction entertainment.  Mr. Card has blazed a new trail and will likely be a standard for classics against which future science fiction will be measured.  His work will be enjoyed by the military tactical thinker and science fiction action adventure fan alike.  Well done.
B000HA4WT8|4.0|I thought this movie was exactly what it was supposed to be.  There was no big name actors, but there was also no bad acting.  Everything was perfect.  The cars were absolutely sick and the scenes with them were amazing.  If you like cars and you like speed, there is no way you can miss this movie.  I am not going to say it is better then the 1st or 2nd Fast and the Furious, but I am not in any way going to say it is worse.  Watch the movie, you'll like it.
B000001ESP|5.0|This was my FIRST Rush Album (Yes, I still have the ALBUM!) and it just blew me away! Alex and Geddy are 2 of the best musicians in the world but Neil is my man! This cat on the drums is A  M  A  Z  I  N  G! One of the best drummers, EVER! He knows how to use his kit without the double kick and speed. Whenever I hear any song from this recording, my first inclination is to grab my air sticks and go to work, especially Tom Sawyer and YYZ. Great classic cd every rock fan needs to own.
B000ICLHIE|1.0|At least I guess they are included there.  The non-deluxe edition proved the only one locally available to me; indeed, I found plenty of copies of it on the store shelves.  Little did I suspect that in buying one for about 35 bucks, I'd fail to get the lyrics I have got with every other Waits album I have-- not to mention details of who is playing what on each track.  I protest.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I have to start by admitting that I saw the show in Vegas also and that probably taints your perception of this album greatly. 6000 speakers in one auditorium with the single most complex audio playback system ever created for a stage performance (something like 24 discrete channels of playback audio)...needless to say, it is difficult to compare one to the other. If you buy this CD and listen to it through earbuds, it ain't gonna be the same experience.  <br /> <br />That being said, I was shocked at the audio quality of the CD. You truly have never heard the Beatles sound this clear. The reviews that mention the excellent separation of the different instruments are dead on. Every single voice or instrument is crystal. It's hard to believe that the engineers were working with some 30-40-50 year old source materials.  <br /> <br />If this review were based solely on the CD though, I'd have to have dropped one star to say that this is just an extremely well recorded compilation album. The reason I gave it 5 stars is because I bought the DVD Audio 2-disc version. The average person reading this review probably doesn't have the playback capability to access the DVD audio track, but even if you don't, you can get full 5.1 Dolby Digital out of the same disc. The multitrack recording of this material much more accurately showcases the kind of sound quality that you hear in the Vegas show.  <br /> <br />The engineers were creative with their use of the surround speakers in the mix and used them for various creative purposes. This recording does not sound like a live concert with ambiance coming out of the surround speakers. Instead, at different times, any number of different sounds, instruments, vocals, etc. may come through any channel. But the effect isn't hokey or overdone. It is just stinking cool. <br /> <br />Bottom line is that this is THE single greatest audio system show-off disc that I own now. It's not the Vegas show, but it still made the hair on the back of my neck stand up the first time I listened to it. As the Spinal Tap gang would say, \\"make sure you turn it up to 11.\\" The sound in the hi-res DVD Audio is so clean that you can turn it up forever and never get a lick of static. Pretty incredible feat for music this old.  <br /> <br />If you have a chance to go to Vegas and do nothing more than see this show, it is worth the price of the airfare and hotel. Until you can do that, buy the album.  <br /> <br />
0783235380|2.0|I disagree with virtually all of the reviewers about this film.  It was touted as a comedy and \\"outrageously funny\\".  Well it wasn't overly funny and it made a real effort to be funny but the \\"funny\\" scenes were so obviously forced and so obviously dumb that they just came across as stupid. Finding a rental car is not that difficult and that is the basis for this movie. I can't believe that anyone is as stupid as these people were supposed to be. Bullock is supposed to be a free spirit but she comes across as immature, undisciplined, and self absorbed.  This was a total waste of talent and Affleck and Bullock did their best but why people of their abilities agreed to appear in this film is a mystery.  I think what put me off of this film is it's totally unrealistic view of marriage.  Of course these are all Hollywood types where any marriage lasting longer than a month is viewed as unusual.  This film would have you believe that every marriage is at its core -- unhappy and that most people are divorced or adulterers. Men and women are unhappy with their partners and anyone who gets married should expect to be unhappy -- that is the message here, but it is also how most Hollywood types view marriage. Beyond that we have the usual Hollywood view that EVERYONE smokes Marijuana or takes drugs of some sort -- EVERYBODY DOES.  Well I don't think so and I thought this film was simply not funny and I don't see anything humorous about being arrested for drugs.  At no level was this film realistic and none of the actions were logical or believable (imagine holding an outside wedding even though hurricane flags are flying -- is anyone really that stupid?)  I gave this film 2 stars only because I watched it to the end -- why I have no idea because it wasn't worth it.
B00005JA2B|4.0|This group with its electronic orchestration, strong lyrics and strong rhythm helped define 70's rock.  And this is their best musical effort ever, with \\"Point of Know Return\\" being the second best.  And yes, \\"Carry On My Wayward Son\\" is in here.
B000001DWG|5.0|When I bought this album I was a huge Pearl Jam, and had heard of Mother Love Bone in the past and knew a very little about them.  Knowing they were the precursor to groups like Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, I bought it ona whim.  I was pleasantly suprised to find something that sounded completely different than what I expected.  With Andrew Wood's amazing glam rock vocals, Gossard and Ament's free range song writing, and an altogether kick in the balls sound, it's worth however much you're going to spend.
B00006684H|4.0|I recently watched this again after getting my 5.1 on and was suprised at how entertaining it was.<br /><br />Here are some reasons I found to like it:<br /><br />1. Sinister corporate paranoia - The idea that things could go terribly wrong when the activities of large, greedy corporations are left unchecked is not exactly far-fetched. The creepy goings on at the Umbrella Corp present a currently relevent scenario.<br /><br />2. Hot chicks - Milla & Michelle are worth watching anytime; but especially when they do the tough-girl thing.<br /><br />  Milla looks particularly nice when semi-nude.<br /><br />3. Delivers the goods - When it comes time for action, suspence & zombie attacks, this flick is fun.<br /><br />4. Industrial setting - If you like that asthetic, lots of cement and steel for you. Industrial music too!<br /><br /> While not going down in history as a genre classic ( it's not doing anything inventive or original ), it's actually a pretty good time for the monster movie crowd. What it lacks for in substance, it makes up for in atmosphere, brisk pacing and visceral thrills.
B00005OWIU|5.0|The soundtrack for all of the Harry Potter movies has been done by classical maestro and 20th century genius John Williams.  <br /> <br />Q; Does John WIlliams make any bad music?  <br />A: No.  <br /> <br />Q: Does the music capture the feeling of the movie, taking you back to parts of the story sequentially?  <br />A: Yes  <br /> <br /> <br />Q: What are the other advantages to buying the soundtrack?  <br />A: Aestetically, you are not competing with the visual imagery of the movie, which was technically well done and highly engaging.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let me start by saying I am *not* a sci-fi fan.  I can tolerate the Star Wars/Star Trek stuff, but am not crazy about it.  So I was far too late in becoming a Firefly/Serenity convert.   <br /> <br />I saw the movie Serenity long after it came out on DVD and thought it was excellent, but still dragged my feet in looking for the Firefly series on which it was based.  A big mistake on my part.  I got the Firefly series and was immediately smitten.  This has to be one of the finest series in recent memory, and with so much unrealized potential due to its untimely cancellation. <br />   <br />Firefly has excellent character development and the tight scriptwriting that Joss Whedon is known for.  It reminded me somewhat of the writing on the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series.  It is extremely well cast, the actors are all pleasant to look at while still looking plausible in their roles, and perfoming those roles perfectly.  It doesn't fail to deliver a visceral punch  when conveying a whole range of emotions, whether it's humor, betrayal, or grief.  This series is a great sci-fi program, but is far more than that.  It creates a world that is realistic with many similarities to the present, but with enough futuristic aspects to maintain the illusion, so there is no doubt it will strike a chord with pretty much anyone who watches it. <br /> <br />This is a series you will put in the DVD player and just let it run.  I dare you to make this DVD set last a week.  It is compelling and wonderful television.  Be warned, when you finish the final episode I guarantee that you will be baffled that FOX let this gem slip away.   <br />

0380789035|2.0|Page 281 out of about 588...and I quit. I looked at the last 50 or so pages that I've read and ask myself, \\"what was the point?\\" Honestly, I have no idea. I feel that large portions of this novel could be removed in their entirety and the reader wouldn't miss them at all. I don't consider that terribly good writing.<br /><br />This book just has the feeling of pointlessness. What is the point? I have no idea. It's obviously not to tell an entertaining story, because the story itself is painfully dull. Is it about the new world of the Internet and television versus the old world gods or something? I have no idea, and at this point I really don't care. If this book offered some striking social commentary, or anything to that affect, it might be worth reading. Again however, the problem is that pages upon pages of this novel have no discernable content. Now, page after page of absolutely no progress would be fine if this were something like Foucault's Pendulum filled with other interesting \\"stuff\\". American Gods most certainly isn't filled with terribly interesting asides however. It's just filled with a bunch of words that don't really say much.<br /><br />Furthermore, there is not a single character towards whom I am not completely apathetic. They are flat and thoroughly uninteresting, and the dialogue is trite. Every idea in this book seems haphazardly thrown together with no clear focus. I would not recommend this work to anyone unless you simply need to kill some time and you've ready everything better.
B00004RF97|5.0|With a cast like this, you can't miss.<br /><br />One of the best!
B0007OASII|5.0|The Fourth Legacy was a pretty good album, but by no means outstanding. Epica was great, but not outstanding compared to acts like Iron Maiden. The Black Halo is on a whole different plane of existence. This album is near perfection by any standard and can stand shoulder to shoulder with any metal album in the world.<br /><br />This album is nothing short of an epic masterpice. I'd review the tracks individually, but there's really no point, as I'm just going to give them all perfect scores. That said, Memento Mori is perhaps one the most amazing, moving pieces I have ever heard. I own a ton of metal albums of all sorts (Iron Maiden, Dream Theater, Brainstorm, Blind Guardian, etc) and without a doubt, I can say that this is the single best album I have ever heard. It is moving. It is pounding. It is powerful. It is phenomenal.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This is by far one of my Very Favorite movies!! All female cast.<br />A movie about men with no men in the cast. Watch for the fashion show!
B000J103YI|5.0|Upon my first play of this, I thought that I would have liked a more contemporary approach, a little more gloss. But on repeat listens it does really work for me. It's just very raw in sound, more like a play instead of a motion picture. It's not a bad thing. It's just not as slick production wise as the CD's from like \\"The Wiz,\\" or \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" It's probably closer to that of \\"Chicago,\\" but the singing and songs are a lot better. It feels like you're sitting in the front row of the theater watching the live show. All of the vocals sound great. They're big, bold, and clear. It truly sounds like the orchestra pit is only a few feet away from you. I would definitely recommend this if you like soundtracks. I absolutely love musicals so I'm really looking forward to the movie. Eddie, Jamie, Beyonce, and Jennifer sound AMAZING. I'm really proud of all of them. And who would have thought that Jennifer Hudson after being cast off American Idol would end up in the feature version of \\"Dreamgirls\\" playing Effie White? Certainly not I. But I think she's the perfect person for that part, a great compliment to Jennifer Holliday's stage character. It seems like she really peaked at the right time. Perhaps being voted of Idol was really a blessing because she still got a record contract AND a major motion picture. And what a gutsy move for Beyonce, the DESTINY of Destiny's child, to take a lesser part to a fairly unknown. Beyonce's used to being the lady out front, so I applaud her for giving up the limelight this time, if only for a brief moment. I'm also glad that Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy are putting their vocal skills to good use. I wasn't a huge fan of Jamie's solo project, but he continues to improve and show great versatility as an artist. So that's always welcome. And how could I forget Eddie Murphy, the voice of Donkey in \\"Shrek\\" has comeback to take a more visible role in front of the camera. That should be fun. They've assembled a great cast and the movie is getting a lot of buzz. The anticipation is building and the soundtrack only makes me want to see it more. I think if you're a fan of movie musicals you'll like this soundtrack. An excellent buy. <br /> <br /> <br />Favorites: Move, Cadillac Car, Steppin' To The Bad Side, Love You I Do, I Want You Baby, And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going, When I First Saw You, One Night Only, One Night Only (Disco), Listen
0743424425|5.0|I read The Shining over twenty five years ago, when I was in high school.  At the time I thought it was one of the best novels I had ever read.  I read a lot of Stephen King at the time, but eventually drifted away from the author (`It' was the last King novel I read for nearly two decades).  Over the last few years I have picked up a few of King's later novels (Dream Catcher, From a Buick 8, and Cell).  These later novels had their moments (especially Dream Catcher) but they never came close to my memories of the early King novels.  And so I decided to re-read some of them to see if they were really that good.<br /><br />I re-read The Shining and was surprised by how great it really is.<br /><br />Nobody does isolation and insanity better than King.  Whether it's a family snowbound in a spooky hotel, a mother and child trapped in a car by a frothing St Bernard, or a writer held captive by a demented fan, Stephen King is at his best when his characters are left alone with their own worst enemy - their imaginations.<br /><br />With Jack Torrance, King has created a fully developed character, deeply flawed and vulnerable.  Jack is a recovering alcoholic, tormented by feelings of fear, resentment and self-pity.  Jack Torrance is not a cartoon-like villain.  He is a complicated, conflicted, and ultimately tragic figure.<br /><br />By creating characters that are fully realized and complex, King draws the reader into the Torrance family's terrifying world.  King takes his time, and lets the suspense build at a slow sinister pace.  I challenge any reader not to find themselves obsessively reading the final pages of this novel without stopping, ignoring the world around them, even if it means staying up all night.<br /><br />The Shining is a well crafted, complex, enormously entertaining work of fiction.  The Shining may or may not be King's best novel (I will have to re-read The Stand before I can say for sure.) but it is without question, one of the best horror novels ever written.<br /><br />In fact it may be one of the best novels I've read, in any genre.ovels ever written.   <br /> <br />In fact it may be one of the best novels I've read, in any genre. <br />
B0009A40ES|5.0|...but there's so much more to love. Even if this movie wasn't a spot-on dissection of Reagen-era attitudes and excesses (not that things are that different today), Christian Bale's AMAZING performance would make it worthwhile. I admit I wasn't too into it at first, thinking from reviews and commercials that it would be \\"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\\" in Armani...after a few more viewings, it really started to sink in. I now watch it at least twice a month. Seriously.    Trying to put this into the genre of horror and compare it to films within those confines misses the point entirely...most of the violence takes place off screen and it's actually incidental to the overall point or \\"message\\". If I had to put it next to another movie for comparison, my choice would be \\"Taxi Driver\\". It portrays the same inner turmoil and desire to belong, but in a much more cold and cynical way. Whereas Travis Bickle (DeNiro) had an almost innocent, Holden Caulfield-esque outlook on life and the drive to be a heroic figure that saves the world, Patrick Bateman sees the world as an extension of his \\"greed and disgust\\". There's also the fact that I've seen each a zillion times and still occasionally pick up a detail or line of dialogue that I'd never noticed before.    Anyway, it's a mind-blowingly good movie IN MY OPINION with beautiful cinematography and great performances from everyone involved (Willem Dafoe's scenes are sparse but hilarious and Chloe Sevigny's character gives a quiet, poignant feel to her major scene with Bale.)    If you don't like it the first time, wait a while and try again.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|To be completely honest, I am not Sarah McLachlan's biggest fan; as a matter of fact, I don't believe I've ever purchased a CD of her's before.  Yes, I've enjoyed a few of the songs she has released, but never felt the need to buy UNTIL NOW!  I accidently found Wintersong while browsing through a music service I subscribe to...I wanted something NEW, something refreshing for Christmas this year.  And, WOW, did I find it.  <br /> <br />In the week that I have owned it, I have played it close to twenty times...I love the traditional songs (which are rearranged to NOT sound traditional)...her rendition of Silent Night and Greensleves are gorgeous!  I love the not-so-traditional songs...simply put, I LOVE the album.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend it, and have bought this CD as a gift for family because it's THAT good.
B0001ZMBV0|4.0|I have always been a fan of Giulini's conducting since I began listening to Classical.  In this case, I bought this disk for four reasons 1. You can never have too many recordings of Bruckner or Mahler. 2. It's Giulini for God's Sake.  3. I was curious to hear a remastering of his sensational Brahms 4.  4.  I could finally get his fantastic Firebird Suite on CD.  Mission accomplished...however the Brahms and Stravinsky are the highlights on this disk and I already had those recordings (although it was nice to get an upgrade to CD).   The Mahler is clearly outclassed by competition from Kubelik and Horenstein.  The Bruckner bested by Jochum or Tintner on Naxos.  I don't regret buying the disk, however, while I have multiple recordings of the Brahms and Stravinskky...Giulini's readings will always have a special place for me.
055358202X|2.0|I discovered this series about 3 months ago. I read the first three in about 3 weeks. The rest of the time was spent suffering through the latest installment. <br /> <br />The only explanation I can come up for the shortcomings/style of this book is that Danielle Steele must have been the ghost co-author. <br /> <br />I feel bad about writing this because I really enjoyed the first three novels, but I will read the reviews BEFORE I buy the next one.
0618680004|2.0|For the longest time, I've wondered why anyone would spend so much time working against an idea instead of working FOR an idea.  It's clear that Dawkins has been negatively tarnished by religion at some point (perhaps a sexual abuse case in his childhood, which is interesting due to his association of atheists' plights and homosexual \\"struggle\\" in the '50's.  He also sees the negative aspects that organized religion has caused in the world (and they are plentiful), but organized religion and GOd are two different things completely.  Organized religion depends on the faulty humans in the organization to promote it- using faulty methods, but God (as seen by most believers) is free from human err, thus when Dawkins confuses the two, he should know that he is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. <br /> <br />Dawkins himself acknowledges that there may be a God- in this book (\\"why there almost certainly isn't a God\\"), and in a recent Time magazine article (\\"There could be something incredibly grand and incomprehensible and beyond our present understanding.\\") so it's evident that Dawkins is leaving room for the obvious.  We humans don't know everything, so there has to be a chance there God exists.  Why that God and Everyone else's God can't be the same thing is up for the arrogant Dawkins to ponder.  It seems to me they are the same. <br /> <br />It's a shame, but I think people hear a well-spoken British accent and think \\"they must know what they're talking about\\" and I think this may influence people too much.  It is what it is: an immature but slick-sounding Straw-man argument for organized religion torn down by a man who is trying to stoke his own ego.
B000IMUYJM|3.0|This movie has been hyped as the \\"prequel\\" to Halloween.  That ideas is even pushed in the commentaries/extras.  While it is a somewhat entertaining movie, it just didn't live up to the billing.  The acting is rough and some parts of the movie just don't make sense.  Why would the police search the town and local campus area without first completely searching the house?  Bob Clark, the director, has currently been pushing this idea that Halloween was his \\"idea\\".  And that is what brought the rating down, the last thing I want to hear on a commentary or in the extra features about a movie is how another movie that was made better and performed better was originally \\"their\\" idea. <br />
0446677450|5.0|Many people are skeptical about this book. I have read about 4 bad reviews to one good. But I see all of his points validated in everyday life.  <br />For instance, he is 100 percent correct to state that many people though extremely intelligent are not wealthy due to lack of financially literacy. There are many people that have the intelligence and talent to become financially free but do not because they lack the basic information on making money from money because they are taught to make money from hard work. I believe that this book is positive in that it perpetually encourages the reader to free their mind and instead of being lazy and thinking \\"i cant afford it\\" to \\"how can I afford it.\\" I believe that if a person reads this book at the age of 20 and follows the advice given they have a very good chance of becoming financially successful.  I would recommend it to anyone. Whether or not his \\"rich dad\\" really existed, the message is still the same and very true. \\"The poor work for their money, the rich have money work for them.\\"  A great start in learning how to think like the rich.
B000AA4LAK|4.0|This album was ripe with hits and remains in the CD changer in my car to this day. The Killers melded new wave, alternative, and rock influences and released quite possibly one of the best first albums anyone has seen in a at least a decade. There are a few songs on the album that i'm not hugely fond of, but the strengths more than overshadow the few weaker parts, and even the  songs I skip are by no means terrible. Buying the import with these three bonus tracks and a bonus DVD with a few music videos on it was well worth it to me, and i'm glad I bought it over the lower priced regular version.<br /><br />Here's my track by track analysis, with my score in parenthesis, 5 being the highest, 1 the lowest:<br /><br />Jenny Was a Friend of Mine (4) - Terrific opener, driving rhythms, great chorus.<br /><br />Mr. Brightside (4) - Probably the most recognized, if not overplayed track on the album, but with good reason, another driving, strong vocals.<br /><br />Smile Like You Mean It (5) - Favorite song on the album, haunting lyrics, extraordinary use of guitars and synth, great percussion work, especially on cymbals. I don't think i'll ever get tired of this song.<br /><br />Somebody Told Me (4) - Another driving rock song. Well-made for radio.<br /><br />All These Things I've Done (4) - Yes, it's true that the line \\"I've got soul but i'm not a soldier\\" isn't the best writing in history, but the guitar and rhythm carry it, with good vocal variety. The video on the DVD of this song is pretty damned good as well.<br /><br />Andy, You're a Star (2) - Mediocre at best, it's a change of pace from the rest of the album up until this point to be sure, but seems overly reptitive. It's either a 2 or 3 star song to me but is at a 2 at this point.<br /><br />On Top (4) - Good use of synth, could have been overdone but luckily they knew where to pull back with it and focus on the lyrics. Flowers' voice seems louder on this song than on previous tracks, and it helps to carry the tune.<br /><br />Change Your Mind (5) - I was thrilled to see this song used in many of the trailers for 'the movie \\"Thank You For Smoking' earlier this year, as it's a neat song. The synth approaches borderline over the top, but the vocals are so wonderful, that it doesn't overpower. This is probably my third favorite on the disc, if not a close second.<br /><br />Believe Me Natalie (4) - Carried by a heavy bassline, it's another storytelling type song, not a bad song, but nothing legendary. It's barely a 5 in my book, it's a good song but might score lower if compared to other Killers songs only. I do however score basing songs against other music of similiar genre, so it remains a 5.<br /><br />Midnight Show (4) - Not a bad song, but the vocals seem to be lacking, and get lost in the background it seems at times.<br /><br />Everything Will Be Alright (2) - It's a change of pace, but seems like a bad way to end an album, and this is where it did end on the normal, non-deluxe version of the disc. It's not terrible, but probably the weakest track on the album. Could have been better if the vocals were done differently, I liked the rhythm, just hated the delivery.<br /><br />Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll (4) - First of three bonus tracks, and is possibly my second favorite song. It's catchy as all getout, and Flowers' seems to be right on target with the vocal delivery and range. Great guitar work, and the bassline was done perfectly. Bonus points for the tambourine hit in the first verse as well, very nice.<br /><br />The Ballad of Michael Valentine (4) - Solid tune, it has a few changes throughout of all the different instruments. Lots of cymbals at some points, but gets the job done.<br /><br />Under the Gun (5) - Good tune, though short. More substance would do it some good. Certainly not the worst song they could have picked to end the album (see above).<br /><br />Overall, this is a strong buy, and a worthy addition to anyone's collection that enjoys this genre ofmusic.<br /><br />Hot Fuss (Deluxe Tour Edition):<br /><br />5 Star Songs: 3<br />4 Star Songs: 7<br />3 Star Songs: 2<br />2 Star Songs: 2<br /><br />Overall: Very Good - 3.8 / 5
B000JK8OYU|2.0|i bought this because of the many good reviews and also because of hearing how it is the first \\"official\\" remix of beatles music. but listening to it was a big let down. this is at best just a beatles best of album which tries to be as mainstream as possible. and at worst a combination of beatles and andrew lloyd webber. to call this a mashup or remix puts those styles in shame. there is absolutely no originality, at points i even have to wonder if the songs are remixed at all.  <br /> <br />what a shame that the beatles did not allow dj danger mouse's grey album ... that was real innovation.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I asked for this DVD as a Christmas Present b/c we lost my VHS tape in the storm.  I can't believe the neg. reviews.  I am a mommy of four/ex-model and this workout has always been so positive for me.  I swing my legs while cooking dinner, I do the squats while brushing my teeth.  Do what you can, results will follow.  The music is great, Cindy is beautiful and inspiring.  I've had to realize I am a \\"stress-eater\\" being commited to this workout will get me into shape again!  THANK GOD!
B000000I3O|3.0|The music is awesome, but what a terrible sound quality! Get another Misfits cd instead. This sounds worse than your old cassettes.
B000002L80|3.0|This is an important piece but not 100% good. I only liked 4 songs.
B0009A40ES|2.0|I tried, I really did. In the end, I watched most of this in fast-forward, hoping that something just a few minutes later into the movie would redeem it. Heck, not even the soundtrack redeemed it, and I love 80s pop.  The was-it-real-or-imagined aspect was rather neat, but the characters were just too weak. It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die.<br /><br />I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end you just can't care. Live? Die? Whatever - just get to the bloody point already.<br /><br />In the end, you'll feel exactly what the main character feels -- nothing.
B000J103PC|5.0|Here goes. Call me a wimp. I don't usually indulge in chick flicks, but for my wife's sake I sat down for this movie--and found myself totally sucked into it.<br /><br />From the pitch-perfect opening scenes of Andrea Sachs facing her potential boss, to the final showdown, we are dragged along with Andie into a world of vicious high fashion. Her journey is our journey, wondering why this is all so important, slowly coming to appreciate it, then realizing the seduction of its beauty and glamour. Some have complained that the situations she faces are contrived and no-win scenarios. While yes, they are set up to advance the story, they are scenes in which Andie could've faced down her boss. Instead, she sold her soul.<br /><br />This is a witty film, sharp as a pitchfork, that has much to say but leaves most of it up to the viewers to figure out. The screenplay and direction are superb, but it's the acting that makes this thing sparkle. Hathaway (mostly believable as a frumpy wannabe journalist...she can't quite hide her natural beauty) shifts from frump to diva in convincing fashion, while never totally losing her heart of gold. Streep shifts from devil to somewhat sympathetic overlord, while never stepping too far from the dark side. Along the way, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are great counterparts, providing humor and heart.<br /><br />In the end, Andie's decision to chase her dreams or chase the career that \\"a million girls would kill for\\" propels this very likeable comedy into a story with sly wisdom running underneath. What a great film.
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|The HP12c Platinum 25th Anniversary Edition (HP12cPAE) is the 2006 special commemorative limited edition model and the second official upgrade of the original HP12C. The HP12c Platinum (HP12cP version 1.0) has been improved since its released in 2003. Although the HP12cPAE is based on the HP12cP version 2.0,it would has its historical place as the 4th model in the HP12C lineage since 1981 and may be unofficially designated as HP12c Platinum version 3.0.         FIRST LOOK AND FEEL. HP has showcased this upgrade with an overall quality in both the looks and feel department. The \\"new\\" retro-styling and colours of the HP12cPAE closely resembles the exterior of the silver plated HP11C, a made in the 1980s HP scientific calculator cousin of the gold HP12C. As a bonus, HP had made this a special purchase for the fans and new owners by including a nice black 25th anniversary \\"PDA\\" style leather pouch with the HP12cPAE. The overall construction is firm and solid and the improved keypad buttons has a very nice tactile feel indeed.For better viewing, users can now adjust the contrast of the clear LCD display screen.     WHAT'S NEW? Since the HP12cPAE is faithfully and conservatively built on the time-proven functionality of the HP12C, existing users should not expect to see any major hardware and software improvements. However,it is evident that HP had listened to its customers negative feedback on its first half hearted attempt to upgrade the HP12C with the slow HP12cP version 1.0 released in 2004. HP had dutifully responded to its customers negative feedback on the HP12cP v1.0 and and demostrated their wholehearted effort with the HP12cPAE by incorporating all necessary enhancements which could be possibly squeezed into the package to expand the capabilities of the classic HP12C.     HARDWARE ENHANCEMENTS. The current upgrade is 6 times faster than the HP12C as claimed and probably 10 times faster than its slow early release HP12cP when performing certain TVM calculations.The improved speed is now up to par with cheaper products from its competitors. This upgrade has four times more data storage memory which is sufficient for input of up to 80 cashflows or 400 programming steps. With the HP12cPAE, advanced users have a more powerful tool which would enable them to store more keystroke programs into their HP12cPAE, to perform routine complex and customized financial calculations by executing the programs stored in its memory.    THE HP12C NICHE. Potential new users of HP12C series of financial calculators should be aware that the proven form factor of the HP12cPAE is quite a novelty product to get used to. Despite the age of its design, if new users are looking for the unique RPN input method and user programming capability, the HP12C series and the HP17B2 series are the only choices available.      AGAINST THE COMPETITION. It is difficult to compare the user programmable HP12C series against offerings by other manufacturers, simply because no HP rivals has ever managed to produce an equivalent product to challenge the HP12C series. Advanced \\"power\\" users of financial calculators would appreciate that complex financial calculation, such as the Black-Scholes European Option Pricing Model formula could be keystroke programmed and stored into any HP12C series. HP12C, HP12cP (versions 1.0 & 2.0) and HP12cPAE users could recall the program from memory to perform routine computations repeatedly.     WHO SHOULD BUY IT?  A fan of the HP12C with some spare cash on hand would probably grab a HP12cPAE off the retail shelf without thinking too hard. From my personal experience, new users to the HP12C series would find that the HP12C actually glows on you and grows with you once you are familar with it.      WOULD IT BECOME A COLLECTOR'S ITEM? Savvy consumers should know that the HP12cPAE is mass produced and sold worldwide as a mainstream consumer product. IMHO, the HP12cPAE would have to be made with real titanium, platinum or gold plated partsand engraved with unique serial numbers if it were to qualify as a rare collector's item. Only time and actual HP sales quantity would determine if any collector-speculator would profit from an auction sale of a new and sealed HP12cPAE on e-Bay.    WOULD I RECOMMEND IT? Yes, definitely. By improving the on the HP12C, HP has again demonstrated in the HP12cPAE (and HP12cP version 2.0) that with the right effort even a good product design can be improved upon at the matured stage of its product life cycle. Now, there is a real rival for the much loved classic HP12C, and it is no other than its successor,the HP12cPAE. Realistically,it is difficult to keep improving a near perfect product such as the iconic HP12C. Judging by the high industry standard it has set, the HP12C would probably celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2031.    Thank you for reading my enduser review, hope it is useful to you.
0618551050|5.0|Theoretical physicist Lee Smolin argues that physics as a science has lost its path and focus - and provides evidence based upon new knowledge of physics and science laws since the 1970s - which have been remarkably slim. During this period there've been many unproven and often popular theories - but no real advancements. One of the major reasons why is string theory - an attempt to bring together all diverse laws and theories under one umbrella - but the flaw here is, no part of it's been tested. Any interested in scientific advancement will find THE TROUBLE WITH PHYSICS: THE RISE OF STRING THEORY, THE FLAL OF A SCIENCE, AND WHAT COMES NEXT to be a fine survey.<br /><br />Diane C.

B0009F9O6W|5.0|That's how this recording can leave you! One of the most stunning works of art I've ever heard. This is truly the epitome of ART rock. The combination of prima donna musicians with Peter Hammill's overblown, theatrical vocal excursions, will take you to strange vistas perhaps never explored by  any other artist. And what a trip it is! Think David Bowie sings King Crimson and that only scarcely scratches the surface. Truly, truly unique. Manic saxophone reminiscent of early Ian McDonald and frantic time and key signature shifts can send your mind reeling. But the beautiful, melancholic sections... For instance, the anthemic \\"Man-Erg\\" (track two.) If you don't get goose bumps from the sheer power and gradiose beauty of this song, you simply don't have a pulse! Every song offered here is a masterpiece you don't want to miss! I would feel quite safe saying you probably haven't experienced anything like this before. A very close second for me is the predecessor, \\"H To He...\\" I also recommend \\" The Least We Can Do....\\" and \\"Godbluff.\\" I enjoy their other recordings,but these to me are their peak achievements. You won't regret this purchase!
0060776757|5.0|Most books by and about rock musicians are written by third parties - and of these, most are lacking in color; so it's a treat to have a large-sized coffee table art book packed with color photos and written by the band members themselves. U2 formed in 1975 and moved from a kitchen band to a world-renowed group still together thirty years later. Their idealistic lyrics affected politics and social issues of their times, while their live performances incorporated revolutionary elements. U2byU2 won't be writing such a book again, so consider this a definitive 'must have' for any fan of the group - and enjoy over 1,500 images taken from the band's own collection.<br /><br />Diane C.

1878424319|3.0|This book is a very fast read.  It is written well, in simple language with examples that the reader can relate to and grasp the main ideas with.  Overall, I liked the 4 agreements the author puts forth and I liked the examples, stories and support provided for these 4 agreements.  What I didn't like was the overly-spiritual overtone of the book, the prayer at the end, and the idea in certain parts of the book that this tip will \\"transform your life.\\"  (I'm generally doubtful that a book, a paragraph or a sentence will transform my life.)  Despite these drawbacks that didn't work for me personally, the book's main points, arguments and conclusions are commonsense and definitely worth consideration, and hopefully, incorporation into one's thinking and approach to life.
0131479415|5.0|This book does a great job at explaining the ideas around Agile Planning and Estimating and why it works better for software projects than traditional waterfall approaches.   <br /> <br />Using a combination of study statistics, experience and practical sense Mike does an excellent job guiding the reader through the basic concepts, why they're different than waterfall and why they work.  I highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to understand why Agile - especially folks who use more traditional SDLC waterfall models. <br /> <br />It's well written in a language both technical and business people can understand.

B000IJ79WU|2.0|I went out and bought this \\"new\\" edition of Superman 2 and after just finishing it I can't wait to sell my copy to the first person I see!  I only gave it two stars because it had some interesting scenes that were never shown previously.  The story line is all out of whack, and whatever four year old they made a movie editor really screwed up a classic! <br /> <br />If this was supposed to be the way the movie was to be shown, thank god it never made it to the silver screen!  It would have ENDED the Superman series once and for all.   <br /> <br />The movie jumps around from scene to scene so much you really notice the scenes they left out that were in the original score.  I am severely upset that I not only lost $21.00, but also that 119 minutes of my life I can never get back.   <br /> <br />If you have seen the original edition as much as I have you will definitely notice a major difference in this version.  It follows no plot.  One minute Lois an d Clark are in Niagra...SHE SHOOTS HIM!!!  and then they are flying to his fortress...no explanation whatsoever!  Now, I KNOW what happens because I have seen it before, but there could have been a better way to incorporate the previously deleted scenes without butchering the movie like they did.  Draw your own conclusions on this one, but as a big Superman fan, this was a major disappointment to me.  I am going to go buy the original and give this one to someone else!
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|Saw them opening for Damien Rice, and wow, I was blown away. Although the show lacked any major production (generally that's so with opening bands), Glen Hansard is an incredible and charismatic vocalist, and Marketa and specially the violin section back him up beautifully. The cd portraits this amazing talent, and the song Falling Slowly has got to be one of the best songs I've listened in the past 5 yrs (and I'm very picky about songs). The whole cd is great, so buy it now and spread the word about Glen and his part time act Swell Season, or also his own band The Frames.
034537410X|5.0|I recently picked this book up again after forgetting about it for ages. Back when I bought it, about two years ago, I took it VERY seriously and even took notes on it so that everything would soak into my brain. That worked, because in that time I had my first truly lucid dream. I was driving a car in this dark tunnel that had a large hole that dropped off in the middle, and somehow I knew that the hole had no bottom, it just went on forever. I was trying SO hard to avoid that hole, and my heart was racing trying to steer clear of it. Suddenly I realized that it was a dream, so I immediately decided, what the hell, I'm driving into that hole! So I did - and the feeling of falling, though normally awful, was exhilerating! It was more like flying. When I kept reading about lucid dreams often being flying dreams, it wasn't all that appealing - but there's something about being lucid in them that makes it much more than just a flying dream. I had a few more lucid dreams in that time, and a handful more in the years that have passed, but I haven't focused on it in a long time. Now I'm hoping to begin again, and this book is my tool. So I highly recommend this book as your tool, too, and highly recommend the practice of pursuing lucidity. It can be done, and it is WELL worth the effort!

B000JJRIN4|2.0|As a long time No Doubt and Gwen Stafani fan, I have to say I was disappointed at the end of this album.  The fire, the excitment, the desire to move to music were all gone.  The first track, Wind It Up, is pretty much the only track I'll likely listen to on a regular basis. <br />What has made Gwen impressive in the past has been her individuality, her ability to march to her own drum.  I couldn't help thinking the whole time I was listening that this sounds like everyone else.  I wasn't expecting to hear No Doubt, I wasn't even expecting to hear another LAMB, but I was expecting to hear something different, and it just wasn't there.   <br />And most of all, I'm disappointed that the inventful, crazy, and classy Ms. Stefani I've grown to love over the years has missed the boat on this one.

0743289412|3.0|I've read/watched/listened to every King creation and love him. And I still do, even after reading Lisey's Story.  Don't get me wrong, there IS a story here, if you are willing to grind through some extraneous material, especially in the first 150-or-so pages.  Until then, reading the story is like looking for a treasure in a cluttered second-hand store. When I finally got past the first couple of hundred pages, I hit a point where I pumped my fist in the air and said, \\"YES! The story has now begun!\\"  Too heavy on the smucky, and too much time spent getting down to the meat of the matter.  The relationship of Lisey and her sisters was under-realized, in my opinion. That could have been explored a lot harder or brought into a different story altogether.  Perhaps the relationship of Lisey and Scott and Scott's childhood was enough of a story.  Also, despite tasty hints at Lisey's parents (whom I kept hoping would show up on a deeper level) we never really got much about them, other than little tidbits.<br /><br />When the backstory of Scott's childhood came out, it was riveting and was a surf on the genuine Stephen King wave of scariness, love, and story story story.  That's why we love the guy's work!<br /><br />King has often said that his challenge is cutting things out and killing his darlings, and in this book he coddled his darlings to the detriment of the overall story.  All that having been said, I would still recommend Lisey's Story just for pleasure of reading King.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|About a year and a half ago, my best friend introduced me to the \\"Firefly\\" series.  Since my friend is a women who it totally a sci-fi geek and I was not hardly a sci-fi fan at all, I was not eager to say yes to her repeated begging for me to watch the Firefly DVD's with her.   <br /> <br />But I finally gave in and watched the pilot episode.  ALthough I was not 'grabbed' immediately, I liked it enough to agree to watch a few more episodes.  By the time we got to disc two, I found myself craving more and more of the show.  I even went so far as to rent one of the DVDs from Blockbuster because me and my friend were having a hard time finding time that week to get together to watch her DVDs.   <br /> <br />By the time I got to \\"Jaynestown\\", I was totally in love with and intrigued by ALL the characters.  The raw emotion and human touch made me feel like I was with them, at the dinner table on \\"SErenity\\", laughing and joking.  I had NEVER felt that way about a television show.  Sure, some shows are interesting and I look forward to them, but Firefly and Serenity had gotten into my soul.  <br /> <br />The DVD's are ones that you can watch over and over and still find them interesting.  I can probably quote most of them, but still adore watching them.  Also, there are no aliens or too many sci-fi effects, so that you feel like everything they are doing is plausible in the future.  The hardships they face are often similar to our current world. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this DVD set enough  ....
B000JLTRJ0|5.0|Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena star as two New York City Port Authority police officers in this magnificent film by Oliver Stone which describes one of the darkest days in the history of the United States: September 11, 2001. <br /> <br />Cage stars as Sgt. John McLoughlin, and Pena stars as officer Will Jimeno.  These two men, along with a crew of other officers, entered into the stricken World Trade Center shortly after the brutal terrorist attacks.  Their job was to go up inside the tower and assist with rescue efforts.  However, shortly after entering the buildings, the collapse began.  The officers immediately dove for an elevator shaft; supposedly one of the strongest places in the building.  Despite their quick thinking, McLoughlin, Jimeno, and the rest of the officers are buried under tons of concrete and debris.  McLoughlin and Jimeno are the only survivors. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Jimeno's wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is 5 months' pregnant with a new baby daughter, and McLoughlin's wife Donna (Maria Bello) is busy making plans for her son J.J.'s birthday party.  Both see the terrorist attacks on television and immediately fear for their husbands' safety.  The two families begin a consant vigil while waiting to hear any news about the well-being of their husbands. <br /> <br />While buried in the rubble, Jimeno and McLoughlin try to do anything they can to stay awake and keep each other alive.  Fearing internal injuries, neither man wants to fall asleep.  They keep each other awake by talking about their families and their lives as police officers.  A deep bond forms between the two, and neither wants to be rescued without the other. <br /> <br />Efforts to find survivors have begun, spearheaded by members of the United States Marines, along with the New York City Fire and Police Department.  One member of the Marine unit is Sgt. Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon).  A former member of the Marines, Karnes has left his regular accounting job to come to New York to assist with rescue efforts.  He, along with another rescuer, hears Jimeno banging on a pipe.  Soon, Karnes has located the two fallen officers, and reinforcements are called in to get them out.  The two men are soon pulled to safety and taken to a local hospital. <br /> <br />Only twenty survivors were pulled from the wreckage of the World Trade Center.  McLoughlin and Jimeno endured more than most people possibly could, and they survived to tell about it.  Both endured several surgeries on their road to recovery, but something more came out of this ordeal; a life-long bond and friendship between two officers who were merely doing their jobs. <br /> <br />This is a truly moving and magnificent film.  Nicholas Cage gives one of the finest performances of his career as Sgt. McLoughlin, while Michael Pena is excellent as officer Jimeno.  Oliver Stone's directing is first-rate, and he tells the story of 9-11 in a factual, yet sensitive and tasteful manner. <br /> <br />I give this tremendous film my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how two heroic police officers risked their own lives to save the lives of strangers and ended up surviving their own personal hardships.  If you have a dry eye after watching this movie, then something's wrong.
B000J103YI|5.0|It's good to know that Simon Cowell's self-aggrandizement has not prevented one deserving \\"American Idol\\" finalist from falling into generic chart-driven mediocrity, but credit for the high quality of this soundtrack recording should first go to Henry Krieger's sturdy, crescendo-heavy score and Tom Eyen's constantly engaging book and lyrics. The most prototypical example of their work is the near-operatic histrionics on \\"It's All Over\\" where all the principals take flashy, fiery turns to illuminate the story's turning point. The combination of talents has yielded a theatrical pop tour de force that brings out the best of its performers, in particular, newcomer Jennifer Hudson, who shines as embattled Effie on the two most melodramatic songs - the triumphantly conciliatory \\"I Am Changing\\" and the classic take-no-prisoners defiance of \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\".<br /><br />Singing in the shadow of the startlingly overwhelming Jennifer Holliday is no picnic, and I am one of those in a show-me mode since I was lucky enough to see \\"Dreamgirls\\" in its original incarnation in 1982. While Hudson may lack Holliday's gospel-fueled, full-throttle delivery, she expertly builds on Effie's emotional desperation with admirable technique and vocal chops that show her in full control throughout, which includes her soulful turn on \\"One Night Only\\" and a new addition, the finger-snapping \\"Love You I Do\\". As Deena, the obvious Diana Ross doppelganger, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles holds her own as she manages to capture her progenitor's breathy, slinky style, especially in the infectious girl-group ensemble numbers. Given her above-the-title status, it's not surprising that Beyonc&eacute; sings a new solo ballad here, \\"Listen\\", somewhat generic though it stylistically fits well within the story. As third member Lorrell, Broadway performer Anika Noni Rose exhibits a beautiful voice (frankly far prettier than Mary Wilson's ever was) but is relegated mainly to the ensemble numbers.<br /><br />The men are comparatively overshadowed on the soundtrack, though Jamie Foxx as ambitious manager Curtis Taylor and especially Keith Robinson (another terrific voice) as Effie's conflicted brother C.C. acquit themselves well, especially on the saucy boogie of \\"Steppin' to the Bad Side\\". But the big surprise is Eddie Murphy, who seems to be channeling James Brown with cunning abandon as Jimmy \\"Thunder\\" Early. Nowhere is this more evident than his spot-on imitation on the comically manic \\"Jimmy's Rap\\". Moreover, backed soulfully by Rose and Robinson, he really shines on \\"Patience\\", a Marvin Gaye-like civil rights-themed ballad, probably my favorite new number on the soundtrack. If the soundtrack is a true indication of the movie, I can't wait to see it.vely overshadowed on the soundtrack, though Jamie Foxx as ambitious manager Curtis Taylor and especially Keith Robinson (another terrific voice) as Effie's conflicted brother C.C. acquit themselves well, especially on the saucy boogie of \\"Steppin' to the Bad Side\\".

1594481938|4.0|This was a fun, light read, in spite of the subject matter.  Hornby does a good job taking what could have been a downer of a subject, and turning it around so that the reader sees the sly humor of it all.  Oh sure, there's some sad and poignant moments, but they're counterbalanced by some laugh out loud moments as well.  Say for instance the hairbrained idea, which they try to sell to the gossip mag's, that the reason they didn't commit suicide was that they all saw an angel who looked like Matt Damon.   <br /> <br />The premise is that four seemingly random people all decide on New Year's Eve to go to the top of a tall building and commit suicide.  But instead of jumping they form a dysfunctional support group for one another.  The ending is redemptive in that each comes to the realization that life is worth living, although it'll never be the same since they've screwed it up so badly.  Hornby takes each of the four's POV and keeps the chapters short.  Each character peels back the onion on their persona and that of their fellow suicides.  It's an intersting character study.
B000E8N690|5.0|Walk the Line is one of the best movies of all time. I do not know how many times that I have seen it. It chronicles the amazing story of the legendary Johnny Cash played by Joaquin Phoenix and his strength and savior June Carter played by Reese Witherspoon. Phoenix and Witherspoon deliver powerhouse performances. What makes the movie even better is that Phoenix and Witherspoon both do their own vocals which really surprised me. They both are talented singers and really did Johnny and June justice. Great acting, great music: What more could you want out of a movie?
B00004W55E|5.0|This woman has a voice that is indescribable.  Vocally, I do not think that anyone can touch her or Teena Marie.  Their voices are definitely God given.  This CD is excellent and Rachelle is an artist in a rare form.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie is so great. James Cameron wrote and directed a beautiful movie. The effects are amazing and great to watch but the love that is shown between Rose(Kate Winslet) and Jack(Leonardo DiCaprio) is so strong and it is unlike any movie that I have ever seen. The plot of the movie is so unique. It is not just about the sinking of Tintanic. There are so many more elements to the story than that. The whole cast is extraordinary which makes the movie so riveting. The movie will make you laugh,cry, and make you realize that love truly does conquer all.
B000HIVO64|2.0|This review might not be helpful to most people, since Midnight Vultures is my favorite album of Beck's and a lot of fans seem to think that one was a bizarre aberration. But The Information comes nowhere near that album in terms of songwriting complexity, creativity, and pure catchiness.  <br /> <br />Remember when Beck used to write catchy, inventive verses? I do. You won't find any on this album, which is mainly monotone or almost stock melody juxtaposed against chorus (again and again, with little variation). Take a song like \\"Strange Apparition\\". Then go and listen to \\"Nobody's Fault But My Own.\\" Hum their melodies to yourself. \\"NFBMO\\" is so unique and superbly structured you could almost hang your coat on it. \\"SA\\" is like a shapeless, formless descending blob of goo. <br /> <br />The songwriting just isn't there anymore, and the further he simplifies his songs, the more he begins to sound like any other songwriter out there. Guero wasn't great, but at least it had \\"Girl,\\" which no other contemporary artist could have written. The Information has \\"Nausea\\" which, while not terrible, could have been thrown together by Jack White on any given day. I'm really disappointed that Beck's songs have become so predictable and generic, and it befuddles me that reviews of his last two albums have been so positive. What am I missing here? <br /> <br />
0800141660|3.0|I should have watched this movie before Pride & Prejudice.  I understand the screenplay & directors were different so it was weird that I kind of expected the same results.  It was ok though.  I'm glad I didn't watch it with my husband though otherwise I would have heard an endless river of yawns & sighs & mumbles of when the movie would end.<br /><br />Was this Emma Thompson's first screenplay????  It was pretty good in that sense.  She looked great in this movie but a bit old when compared to Hugh Grant.  That's ok though because I would have preferred her acting over any other average 17 through 20 year-old mediocre one.<br /><br />Her character was wonderful at keeping all her wits together (minus the 5 second breakdown @ the happy end of the movie, of course).  Kate Winslet was wonderful too.  Her character was a bit too quirky & dreamy for my taste but that just displays her master of the art of acting too.  MAN!  I thought I was a hopeless romantic (modern-day) but her character was just over-the-top!  I'm rather glad she ended up w/the Col. Brandon versus the equally hopeless-romantic Willoughby.  Was it mean of me to be happy that Willoughby left?  No - I thought he was too fake anyway although Marianne fell for it.  Funny, I couldn't help seeing The Sherriff of Nottinghame & worse yet Proffessor Snape when watching Alan Rickman though.  Wonderful actor but it doesn't hurt to see handsome folks on screen (of which I personally don't think Rickman is - to each their own though) but I think that made it even more believable, right?<br /><br />Anyway, the screenplay was well written & this was a pretty movie.  It just wasn't one of my favorites & I don't think I'd watch it again.  Opposite to my thoughts on Pride & Prejudice w/Knightley & Macfayden.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Office Space is one of those rare movies that aren't a big hit, but established itself as an instant cult classic simply by being `almost' a documentary.  I won't give away anything that you can't read in the Amazon Editorial, but the characters are so `clinically clich&eacute;' in a hilarious way.  You will recognize a person from your office in every scene and if you aren't seething with hate, you'll definitely be laughing hysterically.  The guys who scheme the money laundering are truly clever and the boss is truly an inspired piece of irritating nonsense.  Only the girlfriend lacks any comedic fashion other than the workplace she inhabits - a `Chili's' style restaurant nightmarishly funny in itself.  There are some fairly clever sight gags throughout the movie that just keep your interest on a constant level.  I won't say it's a fantastic film, but I sure as heck wasn't bored and found a lot of true, funny events to ponder.  If this film is worth anything at all, it's the character, \\"Milton\\", an overweight, coke-bottled glass wearing, wimpy do-nothing that cannot find his stapler.  He turns out to be the unlikeliest of heroes.<br /><br />The DVD extras are especially inspired pieces of humor and not at all wasteful like most.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|The sound of The Beatles from a different perspective. Alternate versions, productions, mixes and song transitions create a fresh new twist on these classic songs. Guaranteed not to disappoint. This is my new favorite CD!!!
B0000026T4|3.0|Good, but not great. <br /> <br />If you prefer your music heavy, get \\"Brutal Planet\\" or \\"Last Temptation\\" instead. Hell, get both - they rock. <br /> <br />If you prefer your music quirky and less harsh, go with \\"From the Inside\\". <br /> <br />If you prefer old school Coop - well then, you probably already know what you like, and don't need my silly advice anyway, do you?
0895260131|5.0|Recommended to me by a Lebanese Arab-American. After his growing up in Lebanon I am told this is an honest and concise evaluation of the tenents of Islam. I find the book insightful, well written and well researched. 99% of the reviews on this site are positive and I find the negative ones are the ones who are bigoted.  Additionally I notice that all the single negative TAGS associated with this book are likely submitted by one Islamist.
B0007LHBZE|5.0|A few years ago I picked up a book in San Francisco that listed hundreds of cult films of the drive-in ilk, what fun!  I bought a collection of horror films, included in which was Carnival of Souls--which ties for my favorite film in the low-budget horror genre (alongside Night of the Living Dead). After viewing the film, I looked through my book and found that this obscure gem gets a fine treatment, ending with,  \\"The best horror film you probably never saw.\\"  In short, watch it! <br /> <br />From the opening sequence and credits (music and visuals from another world--right up there with Mario Bava and David Lynch in its evocativeness), the viewer is entranced by the sense of alienation surrounding the character who, by the way, can endear us (sense of shared fate) and alienate us at the same time with her ice-princess demeanor (sort of Catherine Denueve).  <br /> <br />Atmospheric, a description that still means something, best describes this film--aided by black and white format.  Music vascilates back and forth between the ominous organ music and upbeat road music accompanying Mary Henry out of town after a lapse of two days of being the only survivor out of three girls whose car goes over a bridge into murky water.  The sheer \\"casualness\\" and \\"business as usual\\" approach to handling the local tragedy makes this type of film infinitely superior to outrageous blockbusters, most of which dull the imagination--Silence of the Lambs always withstanding). <br /> <br />Things I love IN the film: the bridge (Americana), haircuts and shirtsleeves, guys at bridge scene gawking to tell story around dinner table we assume, and best of all--Mrs. Thomas with her can of AJAX and her boarding house:  \\"Take as many baths as you want.  I'm not one to make a fuss about a thing like that.\\" <br /> <br />Heck, I may prefer this film to Night of the Living Dead. <br /> <br />Happy Horrific viewing!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Incredible album,  Have been listening to it since released and it stands the test of time. RHCP have matured and grown but still retain the energy and attitude.  Derivative and Original at the same time. Like the other \\"classics\\", something that my 14 year old son and I can both appreciate. Highly recommended.
B000J103PC|4.0|But Streep is gold. The lady actually builds some sympathy for a character that could have been a stereotype. Some decent laughs.
0393061434|5.0|I recall reading \\"Surely You are Joking Mr Fenynman\\" in high school. I can see striking similarities between Feynman and Woz - both had immense depth in their subject, and yet could talk about it in a layman language. Adventures, pranks and sheer enthusiasm about their field is what both of these characters share.  Reading this book was like talking to Woz face to face (so Gina Smith gets 6/5 stars for that). It is easy reading, simple language and never gives an impression that the man in the picture is the one who almost created the history of PC single handedly. This is contrary to reading iCon, where the situation is always tense. I must also mention that absolutely nowhere does Woz hold any hard feeling towards Jobs, which is the greatness of this man as we know it!  I was particularly impressed with the last chapter - Rules to live by. Here is what Woz says :  - Well, first you need to believe in yourself. Don't waver  - As an inventor, you have to see things in grey scale  - Artists work best alone  Overall, I would rate this book as a piece of art by a man who we all know as a true artist in the electronics industry.
0316153834|5.0|One of the best writers out there delivers big time in The Concrete Blonde. I find his writing so true-to-life and this courtroom/police detective drama is as good as it gets. Attorneys Honey Chandler and Belk are two of Connelly's best characters.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I sort of shook my head as I read some of the reviews of the conclusion of the series. <br />I had read early after the first movie that the W brothers intended all along to have 3 levels to the saga.  The action part of it was to appeal to a certain segment of the movie public.  Matrix 1 certainly captured the attention of the game playing segment of the population but there was an undercurrent to all the movies that wasn't about the special effects. <br />I was so surprised that more people didn't catch the King Author references in the movie.  There were so many but particularly the ending when the \\"boat\\" took the dying king to Avalon.   <br />The shinning promise of Camelot was no more but the world was left with the hope that should Arthur  be needed for the final battle that he would return . <br />The other element was that in the end it wasn't the war that mattered.  It was what Neo was willing to give that mattered.  That in the end that Neo made it possible that those who came after would be able to enjoy another sunrise.    <br />That all of us have the potential to be the one.  I think a lot of people wanted to feel the the hero kicked butt and won and came back the conquering hero.   <br />But real life isn't like that.   In this country during this particular time we have come through a period where we have glorified war and claimed the heroes were the ones willing to fight for glory and gore.  The reality is that many of them come back in body bags and a lot come back as amputees--  Their real fight just beginning.  Now they have to find a reason for a future after they have given everything they had.  They were heroes when they left for war and every one applauded them for going but very few people want to look at them when they come back in pieces. <br />Neo gave everything he had and lost everything he cared except his belief that there should be a future.  I left the movie feeling inspired and wanting to rise to the potential  of being \\"the One\\".<br /> <br />The spirit of Neo lives!   YOU BE THE ONE!!!
0060853964|4.0|Excellent book. Very funny, could have been darker, though. If you're into Hitchiker-type Brit wit, you'll dig this.  <br /> <br />Personally, I'd have enjoyed it more if I hadn't recieved it from... someone who (might have) \\"cast a spell\\" or two to meet me. And, she may 'worship differently' than some of us, but damn if she doesn't have a nose for funny books! Yeah. She gave me this book (after having lost her enthusiasm for me). Maybe she was trying to tell me something? <br /> <br />I can't think of a better \\"Last Book\\" to have read. \\"Good Omens\\" may be mine. If she's reading this:  ...hi?
0679422714|1.0|My Chinese History professor once had a meeting with many other prominent scholars in this field to discuss the credibility of the book.<br /><br />They found many dubious details in the book such as that the authors frequently (perhaps purposely) incorrectly cite other sources in order to strengthen their arguments as well as use unsupported information.<br /><br />In the end, they concluded that the book is factually and intellectually unreliable.<br /><br />Driven by curiosity, I borrowed a copy from a friend and read couple dozen pages, and concluded that the book is more like an anti-communist propaganda and I should jus trust my professor/her colleagues' words.
0743424425|5.0|This was the first Stephen King book I finished.  Since then, I've read about half of his books, and thus far, this is the best one yet.<br /><br />While many argue that the DT series and The Stand are King's best, I think that this is by far his most successful attempt at horror.  Few books have ever frightened me, but this one seriously chilled my blood.  One of the most poignant aspects of \\"The Shining\\" is that it touches on something that everyone can relate to: isolation.  While the Torrances are both physically isolated in the book, they are also emotionally isolated.  King also addresses questions of madness and his influences from Lovecraft and Poe are especially evident.<br /><br />The book is archetypal of most of King's novels, with a fast pace and an explosive ending, but because \\"The Shining\\" was an early novel it avoids many King-ian cliches his more recent works have exhibited.<br /><br />A definite must read, both for the horror fan and non-horror fan alike.
0790732254|5.0|This is quite possibly my most favorite film EVER. I'm only 26 years old, yet this film feels as though it could have been filmed yesterday. The acting is spot-on (except for a few inconsistencies by \\"Nick\\"), and the story is amazingly intense. Not for the easily-offended (but, then, no good stuff is!).

It really made me understand on both the local and global scale how my food choices not only effect me personnaly, but also my community, my country, and the rest of the world. My dietary choices now come from a better educated place.  Highly readable, although the section on industrial farms goes on about corn a little longer than necessary.  I finished the book feeling not only smarter, but also like I had made a new aquaintance - already looking forward to his other books.

B0009KA7BS|4.0|I thought this movie was entertaining and fun to watch.  As for all the blasphemy complaints.  Hello, people! Demons are made up, so taking liberty with terminology like \\"half-breed\\" is a non-issue. I, personally, was very happy with their good vs. evil-as-game theory.  Cool.
B000J103PC|5.0|Okay, I read the other reviews here. And... quite honestly I think some people are missing the point to this story. <br />This is really the story of Andrea and how she learned what it sometimes takes in this world to move on and up. There are those things we strive toward in life and along the way others have to be discarded. Simple fact of life. <br />Meryl Streep is exquisite as the consummate bitch (as good a job as in 'The Manchurian Candidate' but with a twist). The acting, filming, story and music all come together in this one. <br />Meryl senses something in Andrea which is revealed toward the end of the film. She takes her on and teaches her what it takes in the industry to get to where she got. <br />When Andrea finally realizes her 'job' was actually a lesson and what that lesson was, she walks away from it. But she has gained more insight into herself and discovered what she felt she could never do... she had already done. The name of the game is survival. <br />On the surface this is a well played out dromedy. But it does have a deeper message and all the characters in the movie are easily identified with. <br />Saving going into detail here..... forget the movie is about the fashion industry and watch it. There are life lessons, albeit tough ones, taught here. Watch the interactions and growth in the group of characters and you will be nicely suprised.  <br />I don't believe any other movie has played this theme out as well, and as cleverly as this one. <br />Not to be missed!
B000002KOQ|4.0|As my first introduction to Ms. Mitchell's work, I had no idea what to expect. I was riding the wave of celebration for the 20th anniversary of Woodstock, and happened to catch an interview with Graham Nash, where he mentioned her penning the ode for the event, that piqued my interest. Fourteen years old and eager to explore, I went in search of the eartheral creature described.<br /><br />The tape, long ago replaced by a CD, exceeded all expectations. The \\" Woodstock\\" anthem was so well written, especially for a \\" Kid who couldn't make it\\", as Mitchell was quoted as saying a few years later. However, in typical fashion, she captured the spirit behind the event. In retrospect, this ability to create vivid pictures with her words created the hallmark for the brilliance of her emerging greatness as a song writer.<br /><br />Ms. Mitchell's voice is above reproach; she easily had the most angelic, sincere delivery of all the genre combined. The songs contained here reflect the free spirited ethos of the late 60's, with some personal observations painting a lush portrait of Canyon life. The skill of distilling gender role questions, pastoral living, spiritual seeking, and the thrill of opening oneself, as well as another, to the possibility of love is amazing. Considering she was only twenty seven, at the oldest, when these songs were written, the talent assumes a new level.<br /><br />This is a great intro to Joni's work; then, if you choose to work back to the first two, you will see the improvements on already exquisit work.  If you proceed to the next succession of material, you can trace the gift truly taking form. For days that mellowing out seems the only option, this is a perfect soundtrack.
B000002GQK|5.0|...Progression.  Or should I say Procession as in the lead off track?  This is my personal bestest favorite Moody Blues album and the one I would declare part of my 10 must have on a desert island albums.  Why?  If you have read Dustyart's review of To Our Children's...Children you will find I am in total agreement as to the qualifying peak of Moody Blues albums.  Lost Chord, Threshold, and Children were truly composed with 5 brush strokes of pure genius, painted together as a whole of one mind in conceptualization and magical psychedelia unparalleled by anything else they would do.  Days of Future Passed kicked off this \\"new\\" Moody Blues that became the \\"core seven\\" ending in 7th Sojourn of course.  Days is brilliant classical-rock.  Question of Balance held together as an environmental concept, an \\"awareness\\" album, and then came the 5 notes of musical procession EGBDF (the mnemonic aid for the lines of the treble clef).  7th Sojourn ended up being a wave good-bye, a loose \\"sailing journey\\" where the ship disappears over the horizon, seemingly never to return.  The Moody's \\"broke up\\" but then returned for an aptly titled Octave, with Pinder barely hanging on to the vessel.  With the close of that album, penned by Pinder, he never sailed that ship again.  The reasons for that are evident on this album with his contribution(s) here.<br /><br />Though EGBDF is loosely a \\"concept album\\" dealing with \\"music\\" as it's centerpiece, the songs offer some personal insight to a few of our shipmates, including the opener Procession, written by all five.  It is the only Moody Blues song with the distinction of being written by all members of the group.  Procession uses musical challenges to illustrate the evolution and history of music from the \\"desolation\\" of empty space, to \\"creation\\" in whatever scientific/religious view you take it, to \\"communication\\" (musical beginnings were in sounds used to convey messages between species), and from it's rudimentary drummings beginnings through eastern and occidental classical forms to electronics and rock.  by this means, each member contributes his insight to the musical progression.<br /><br />As with all core seven Moodies, the tracks run together with no breaks and at the peak of rock guitar, Procession breaks into the top-40 hit single The Story In Your Eyes, one of Hayward's best rocking guitar and harmony vocal songs, perhaps even his best by some votes.  I personally love the song lyrically, poetically, and musically.  It balances a solid rock edge with beautiful vocals and heartfelt emotions.  The short but sweet lead guitar solo demonstrates Justin's almost effortless talents in straight forward rock and roll.<br /><br />Ray Thomas follows up with an autobiographically introspective number that tugs at the heartstrings with piano, mellotron, drums, and electric guitar.  Lodge and Hayward accent Ray with terrific harmonies.  This song has an ebb and flow as a tide and as in other Thomas songs, tinges the listener with salt and sand.<br /><br />Emily's Song by John Lodge was written for his daughter, newly born before this album went into production.  Couple that with the fact that the metre and rhyme scheme are highly reminiscent of Emily Dickenson poetry, and John has created one of his most beautiful songs that dwarfs many of his later efforts.<br /><br />After You Came is a Graeme Edge penned heavy-on-percussion rocker with John on lead vocals, harmonies from Michael and John overdubs.  As a solid rocker, Justin provides some great lead guitar and the ending of this track left us old timers clamoring to get to side two of this masterful work!<br /><br />One More Time To Live is my reason for keeping this album in my top ten.  Musically and lyrically, it is a return to the opener of the album.  John Lodge has penned (in my humble opinion) the best Moody Blues song ever with this one.  The song begins with the sweetness of Emily's Song but quicky enters a middle eight not matched in anyother MB composition.  Using the motif of Desolation, Creation, Communication, created earlier, John provides a progression from chaos to tranquility with harmonies and double-up vocals (from Hayward) and growing piano and percussiveness that grabs the listener, riveting you to your seat not once but twice through.  Listen to this song if you have never heard it before and tell me it is not a Masterpiece of The Moody Blues!  By songs end, you are wasted away, used up, but left with enough heart to go on to the next beautiful track.<br /><br />Ray Thomas now gives us music as provided by nature with Nice To Be Here.  This is one of Ray's best, both lyrically and musically.  The mid-tempo is gorgeous, the song is both beautiful and amusing.  Every note from flute to mellotron to drumming is spot-on perfect.  This song ranks with Legend of a Mind, and, Dear Diary, in creativity alone!  Ray brings an energy back to you from your trip with John that your are going to need with Justin's next track.<br /><br />You Can Never Go Home is a low soft starter that builds to an amazing crescendo.  Hayward's lyrics are so sad yet hopeful that if a song is a tearjerker, this is definitely one.  His imagery, his guitar work, and his harmonies with John and Michael are immaculate.  This is my second favorite on the album and ironically, it is both just as sentimental as One More Time To Live and exactly opposite in mood. Justin's voice is at it's peak of perfection on this album, and this song is perhaps his strongest vocal performance.<br /><br />EGBDF closes with the Pinder composition My Song, which forbodes his eventual disassociation with the Moodies, and gives us a glimpse into Michaels own spiritual center which he he would take with him to the Stone Canyon Family and would pop up in his solo effort The Promise.  This piece of music is intense, heavy on mellotron, heavy on introspective vocals, heavy on chorals, drumming, musical build up, it is all here.  The Music that EGBDF centerpieces, is here in it's \\"all-ness\\" with Michael introducing us to the music of the spheres that he hears inside, the Melancholy Man gives us his first brief glimpse of the outer-worlders that he chose to follow.  As the song fades away, Pinder' keys float into space with the same pitch as they came in at the beginning of the album, returning us again to that cycle which is infamous in Moody Blues recordings.<br /><br />I am sorry Michael Pinder chose to leave the group, but given the directions that were evident on the next album (7th Sojourn) it is not surprising, and rather than being a messy divorce, Pinder just had reasons for moving on, both spiritually and musically.  Justin and John would propel the group into a new direction, but not before Michael slapped down two more heroic tunes on 7th Sojourn and the his one swan-song on Octave years later.<br /><br />Every Good Boy Deserves Favor is the last \\"cohesive\\" MB \\"concept\\" album and that is using those terms loosely, since Question is probably the last true concept album they made.  This is an album which is difficult to review, but I wanted to entice anyone who has not heard it, or is new to the Moody Blues, to get this album, since some fans, like myself, simply love this album.  It is not so dated as their early efforts which relied on the psychedelic movement.  The music here is timeless since it is written with musical notation and classic lyrical efforts in mind.  It is an album which attempts, and succeeds in, creating a musical journey about musical journey.  If you are a fan of the late Moody Blues (80's and recent) then this album will be a shoe-in for you.  If you have recently discovered The Moody Blues, are young and adventurous and already Chord, Threshold, Children, and perhaps even Days familiar but have not ventured into the 1970 Moody Blues, this here album is the transition point.  It has the best of both worlds.  There is not one weak track.  Every vocal is perfect, every song is a \\"10\\" by my vote, I just happen to like two special ones above the others, so they get a 10 and a half!  The only failing of this CD is that unlike with the old gatefold album covers, you don't get a 13\\" by 25\\" foldout of the gorgeous cover that Phil Travers created, the album cover was a work of art itself.<br /><br />So if you are a Good Boy (or Girl) who loves the Moody Blues, you Deserve to treat yourself to THIS Favour!  It may even become your Favor-Ite!e Music that EGBDF centerpieces, is here in it's \\"all-ness\\" with Michael introducing us to the music of the spheres that he hears inside, the Melancholy Man gives us his first brief glimpse of the outer-worlders that he chose to follow.

1594200823|3.0|Delightfully written, very fast reading, emotionally honest, Michael Pollan has produced the best discussion I ever saw on the realities of \\"organic\\" food. The original altruistic \\"organic\\" concept and its degradation by industrial food producers and the USDA is covered in great detail, even the harassment of small farmers by USDA inspectors. Another object was to trace the origins of many common types of food; this was very well done. The magnitude of fossil fuel consumption in industrial farming was deplored, as well as the long-term unsustainability of it. The difficulty of producing \\"organic\\" food on a large scale was portrayed in detail, but the desirability of the closed cycle of grass, cattle, manure, etc. was made clear. Pollan's observations were on-the-spot, hands dirty and prolonged. He also went into great detail about shooting a wild California pig, confessing to all the feelings that another city boy, myself, would have had. The book works up to a climax of Pollan preparing a meal he gathered, grew, picked, killed and butchered himself for 10 guests who helped him. Had Pollan stuck to these topics, I would have rated this book 5-star. <br />  <br /> So long as Pollan stuck to his own observations his dissertation was excellent. But an internal contradiction marred this work seriously. Later we see that Pollan did and does eat meat, and has no intention of changing this, even after learning all the arguments of vegetarians and trying it for a couple of weeks. But throughout the book he regurgitates the dogma on the evils of fat in general and saturated fat in particular (pp1,75). He calls foie gras and triple crème cheese and saturated fat \\"demonstrably toxic\\" in the total absence of any evidence for this claim. Beginning on p2 he dismisses the Atkins low-carb diet by making the usual blunder -- calling it high protein rather than high fat. Pollan claims that Atkins was discredited rather than resisted by the low-fat dogmatists. Pollan calls bread andpasta the most wholesome and uncontroversial foods in abject ignorance of the damage they do to anyone with gluten, wheat or carb sensitivity. See Life Without Bread by Allan & Lutz (2000), and Dangerous Grains by Braly & Hoggan (2002). He is deluded that the calories from food eaten must go into activity or fat cells, and blank on another possibility -- generating heat. And the most commonly eaten polyunsaturated fats, those with linoleic acid, are very unhealthful in excess, being both atherogenic and carconigenic, quite opposite to the dogma (p267). See Eat Fat, Lose Fat  by Enig & Fallon (2005). Our brains do not require that we eat carbohydrate (291); they do fine making glucose from amino acids, and there is no requirement for carb in the human diet at all. See The Modern Nutritional Diseases by Ottoboni & Ottoboni (2002). <br /> <br /> Polyphenols have not been substantiated as essential and healthy nutrients in plants (p179); some ethnic groups are quite healthy with no plant food. Potassium and magnesium as important macronutrients in plants were ignored. Cassava does not contain \\"cyanide\\", which is an ion that is not found in the plant (p293), but it contains an organic cyano compound that liberates something on cooking, perhaps hydrogen cyanide. The hoary non-science on DDT and eggshells was repeated (p324) with no effort to check the facts. See Trashing the Planet by Dixy Lee Ray (1990). Far from there being only 225 tractors in all of America in 1920 (p38), there was: \\"...an increase in sales from 21,000 in 1915 to 203,200 in 1920.\\" See Conant M, J Bus Univ. Chicago 1953;26(1):26-36. There were the usual unsupported assumptions about global warming (p47). See Hot Talk Cold Science by Fred Singer (1999) and State of Fear by Michael Crichton (2004), for an antidote. <br /> <br /> The dissonance between accurate investigative reporting and inaccurate dogma as background limit the overall appeal of this book to about 3-star. Reader beware of the dogma part. <br /> <br />  <br />
B000I0QK74|4.0|'James Taylor at Christmas' is just what you'd expect.  Taylor provides a mellow, heart-warming rendition of holiday songs.  What a great way to unwind on a couch near a fire and forget all the hectic strands of the holidays.  What you don't expect is the instrumentation.  I thought he'd provide some spare, acoustic guitars and his trademark vocals.  There are more than a few songs that are given the modern, jazz-lounge treatment with a dining room feel from the piano.  The understatement is still present, but it's no 'Sweet Baby James'.  I also didn't expect his voice to be in such great form after all these years.  Perhaps never being a propulsive rocker, his voice hasn't seemed to age one bit.  There are plenty of standards, like \\"Winter Wonderland\\" and \\"The Christmas Song,\\" but there are other numbers I've never heard before, like \\"River\\" and \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\".  None of them are penned by him, but they suit him quite well, nonetheless.  The addition of guest stars, like Natalie Cole, round out the variety quite nicely, too.      Who could resist a chance to listen to a soothing Christmas C.D. that's hardly muzak to our ears and never formula with its crystal clear modern production?  Take some time to rest and relax with J.T. on the C.D. player!
0066620996|5.0|I borrowed this from a friend and zipped right through it and then bought my own copy. I am not a manager, but found the principles easy to understand and applicable to my life, both at work and at home. I am excited to see changes in my life as I implement what I learned from the the cited companies. I highly recommend this easy to read, yet relevant text.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Wow where do I start? Rent is  so good its the kind of movie that you can and will watch 100 times!!!!! Most of the actors are from the broadway show and it was a brilliant idea for them to be used in this movie. The music is awesome, the story line grows on you, and in all honesty it is now one of the best movies i have ever seen!!!!!
076790592X|2.0|while the story may be a good one, i found the book slow. being dyslexic with ADD, i had a very hard time getting into the books plots and found it even more dificult to get through it. I believe, this book is a best seller simply for the number of professors requiring it to be read.
B00003CWOL|1.0|Forget about what your read from people giving this a one star effort because they say its \\"offensive\\" or \\"anti-religious\\", its a one star effort because we have a great cast here that is wasted on what is clearly Kevin Smith's worst movie. As I watched the first half-hour, I was waiting for something to be funny, and it just wasn't. I was felt like I was wasting my time, so I finally hit the stop button, as I couldnt bear to watch another minute of this snooze-fest. Believe me when I tell you that I find everything amusing, hell I even bust out laughing when watching Spongebob Squarepants. If you are a fan of Kevin Smiths films, please stay away from this one. Go into your collection and watch Mallrats on Clerks again.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|this album is good. It has about 24 tracks.  I would say that 11 or 12 are worth listening to.  I didn't buy this album though.  I listened to samples of all of the Bif you don't have that option, the album is still worth the money.  Stat quo especially shines on this album
B000002NJS|5.0|I have been a HUGE Madonna fan since I was 15 years old.  I am now 38, and I believe this to be her BEST album to date.  This album showcases what an amazing voice she has.  She truly is talented, and with this album, she shows us a more tender side of her that has come from motherhood.  I love this album so much, and even tho it's been out for a few years now, I still listen to it at least twice a week.  I will never get tired of it.  The lyrics to EVERY song are profound, but my favorite track is \\"Swim\\".  It truly speaks to me about starting over.....  I also REALLY love \\"Shanti/Ashangti\\".  Altogether, there is not one single bad song on this cd.  It is beautiful and it flows like magic.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in expanding their mind.  However, I will say, this album is NOT for people who do not have open minds.  In \\"Frozen\\" she reminds us \\"....you're so consumed with how much you get / you live your life with hate and regret....\\"  Obviously, NOT for the close-minded!
0694003611|5.0|I loved this book as a teacher and now as a mom I had to have it for my daughter.  She still hasn't fully appreciated the sweetness of the story but she is only 9 months and the pictures are most important right now.  She is actually quite drawn to the contrast of the b/w pictures and the color pictures.   <br /> <br />Get the board book not the hardcover - I have both now because I bought the hardcover first.
B00000JNO1|4.0|After Skynyrd had released their debut album and \\"Second Helping\\", they were under much pressure from their record company to put out their next album.  They were in quite a rush and didn't have nearly as much time to make this album as they did for their first two.  Hence the title, \\"Nuthin' Fancy\\".  That's one of the things I love about this band; not only is there so much meaning in most of the songs, but even the album titles have a meaning. <br /> <br />We start off with \\"Saturday Night Special\\", a song that they had written for some Burt Reynolds movie (I don't remember the name).  Ronnie Van Zant wrote this song basically to protest against certain hand guns.  He wasn't against having a gun in the house in case of burglars, but he was writing about hand guns that were only good for close-range shooting, so he's saying that those guns were just made to kill people, not for protection.  Just listen to the words: \\"Hand guns are made for killin' ain't no good for nothin' else; ain't no good for nothin', but puting men six feet in a hole\\". <br /> <br />Next we have \\"Cheatin' Woman\\", one of the weaker tracks on the album.  It's basically the story of a depressed man who's girlfriend is cheating on him; pretty basic. <br /> <br />After that, we hear \\"Railroad Song\\", a tune about a hobo who basically rides on a train from town to town trying to get his music out there, but nobody in town wants him around.  So it's basically a never-ending story, getting the same reaction in every town, but he refuses to give up, so he just jumps on another train and writes more songs. <br /> <br />Next is \\"I'm A Country Boy\\".  Funny, it's not really a country song.  In this song, Ronnie talks about how he is happy where he is, living in the country, and that he has no interest in living in a big city, but also tries to show that he's not saying city people and city life are bad, just that it's not for him.  \\"What's right for me, may not be right for you.  You live your way, and I'lllive mine\\". <br /> <br />Next we hear \\"On The Hunt\\".  This song seems to basically be about a guy who is searching for a woman, who meets a woman who is always searching for a man.  A pretty good song (I still give it 4/5), but the lyrics don't speak to me as much as the other songs. <br /> <br />Next is the real treat, and probably my favorite song on the album, \\"Am I Losin'\\".  The lyrics of this song just stick with me so much, I could listen to this track over and over again.  It was written about Skynyrd's original drummer, Bob Burns, who had left the band before they made this album.  It's just such a sad song where Ronnie is basically asking God why he is losing someone who was one of his best friends.  \\"Why these things happen Lord? I don't understand. But Lord, it can sure hurt a man.\\"  This song almost brings tears to my eyes sometimes.  It should've been a classic.  Definitely one of my top ten favorite Skynyrd songs. <br /> <br />Next is the only song on this album that I can honestly say that I just don't like: \\"Made In The Shade\\".  It's basically a song about a woman who has left her man, and he doesn't totally understand why; he was good to her, he tried to make her happy, but he just wasn't good enough for her, and he's just saying that she had it easy with him, so leaving was her mistake.  To me, this song just doesn't fit on this album, or any other Skynyrd album.  It just doesn't really sound like a Skynyrd song to me. <br /> <br />The album ends with \\"Whiskey Rock-A-Roller\\", a song Ronnie wrote about being on the road and that playing music and touring is all he knows; it's what makes him happy.  It's basically what \\"Travelin' Band\\" was to Creedence.  While this is also a very good song (another one of my favorite Skynyrd tunes), the studio version on this album pales in comparisson to the live version on Skynyrd's \\"One More From The Road Album\\". <br /> <br />If you don't own this album, you don't know what you're missing.  No, it's not Skynyrd'sbest album, but it's not their worst either; that wouldn't be possible, because all of their albums are good ones. <br /> <br />I remember reading that Ronnie wasn't too crazy about this album, but I don't think he ever gave himself enough credit.  Most songwriters just come up with words because songs need them, but Ronnie wrote lyrics that people could really understand; lyrics that were about something and told us a story.  I just wish more musicians put as much thought and meaning into their songs as Ronnie did. <br />Fly on Free Bird.
B00006ADFL|5.0|Opening with a startling sequence involving two blood soaked teenage girls, `Heavenly Creatures' begins and ends in tragedy.  Telling the shocking true story of two young girls who committed a terrible crime, this film is as accurate as it is moving.  Pauline and Juliet were just two girls in love, but when their families insisted on separating them they had no choice but to take matters into their own hands.   <br /> <br />Melanie Lynskey and of course Kate Winslet work wonders with their roles, each one so different yet so much the same.  Melanie plays Pauline Rieper, the narrator of the story.  She's a bit of an outcast, living under strict watch of her parents Honorah (Sarah Pierce) and Herbert (Simon O'Connor), but when she meets Juliet things start to change for her.  As Juliet, Kate infuses so much natural charm into her character that you can instantly understand why Pauline would be attracted to her in the first place.  They instantly bond, growing closer to each other with their fantasies and stories.  Juliet's parents are much different than Pauline's.  They are much more lenient yet they tend not to take much interest in their young daughter, even going as far as to leave her when she goes ill, not seeing her for four months.   <br /> <br />The girl's parents soon start to suspect something indecent between their daughters and try and separate them, to no avail.  When Juliet's health worsens and her parent's marriage starts to crumble they insist on sending Juliet away, out of the country without Pauline.  It's at this point that the plot is hatched to murder someone standing in their way...just who is it?  The end of this film, as shocking as the beginning, will leave you speechless.  Peter Jackson deserves honors for bringing this horrendous account to life and casting such wonderful talents to help in doing so.   <br /> <br />Being the debut for both Winslet and Lynskey it definitely shows what amazing things they are capable of (I mean since her debut in '94 Kate Winslet has gone on to receive 4 Oscar nominations and may very well receive number 5 this year!).  This is not one to miss for any fan of a moving drama that delves deep into the minds of two young girls who just wanted to be together, no matter what!
B000J10EQU|2.0|In my opinion they've yet to find a decent Superman. Christopher Reeve was gawky and uninteresting. Brandon Routh is simply a cardboard copy. In fact, Superman Returns is plagued with bad acting and bad character development. Even the music is old. We've seen and heard everything before. Kate Bosworth makes a dreadful Lois Lane. She neither looks nor acts like a pushy female reporter and was not terribly bright. (Superman and Clark Kent coming back at the same time? Du-uuuuh!)<br /><br />Arguably the best CG in the movie was the scene where Superman saves the plummeting plane from disaster and brings it to rest in the Metropolis Stadium. The scene could have been far more memorable had it been accompanied by great music. Bryan Singer should have recalled the crash landing in the beginning of the last Star Wars movie. That's how a scene like that should be handled.<br /><br />Every modern movie has a chase scene and Superman Returns serves us the same trash that every other action film serves. This time Luthor's girl friend is in a car with no brakes and yet which amazingly remains at 60 mph no matter how many cars and fire hydrants she hits.<br /><br />Superman lowering planes, raising land masses and doing other physically impossible feats works in comics, perhaps, but not in modern movies where audiences are more sophisticated. The movie wastes too much time on contrived action scenes and never develops anyone's character, except possibly Luthor's, and that's primarily because of Kevin Spacey's irrepressible acting ability.<br /><br />Finally, I suspected the true heritage of Lois Lane's son about two seconds after he was introduced. So much for surprises.<br /><br />This film shows why Marvel Comics has the superhero genre wrapped up. Even a bad Marvel film is better than the best DC superhero film, though Batman's return movie was undoubtedly the best of all DC fare.<br /><br />Hopefully, one day the right director will come along and give us a Superman and a Dracula that will knock our socks off. But that day is still a way's off. As for now, both characters must wait for a future \\"return\\" of merit. This movie wasn't it for Superman.rman and a Dracula that will knock our socks off. But that day is still a way's off. As for now, both characters must wait for a future \\"return\\" of merit. This movie wasn't it for Superman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00002Z88D|5.0|I just put this in after not listening to it for probably a couple years. Once again it blows my mind - you can read others opinion about the songs, or how talented Kamen is, but the bottom line is you just have to experience it for yourself. At first you may think, how the hell would metallica play with a symphony? Then you hear it; and suddenly genres typically poles apart blend together in an overwhelming aurgasm you have to hear for yourself. The symphony adds a whole new level to how \\"big\\" metallica sounds. The intros which are noticably metallica, but purely symphonic, such as \\"no leaf clover\\", build to a perfect peak and then rip open with your typically metallica suddenly accentuated by strings and brass. Absolutely brilliant.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Never got a chance to enjoy this superior take on Whedon's sci-fi future, during it's TV run.   <br />Characters are incredibly deep, plots are riveting and effects are good enough to keep you interested.  I believe this series is better on DVD as consecutive viewings of episodes really endears the crew and their plights to the viewer's heart.  Fillion is simply incredible.  Beyond his ridiculous good looks lurks the heart of a genuinely talented actor.  He really made the role his own and added so much to what could've been a mail-in part.  While Serenity has flown it's last mission, let's hope these gifted actors all get worthwhile projects in the future.  What a great ensemble cast.   <br />As the header says, at this price there's no reason not to own an incredible series. <br />
B000JJRIN4|4.0|Gwen's second solo album,\\"The Sweet Escape\\" manages to incorporate various styles to offer 12 distinctly unique tunes. It opens with \\"Wind it Up\\", sampling the Sound of Music's \\"Lonely Goat Herd\\", singing about being a girl, and exactly why boys adore them. Suddenly you realise you've missed having Ms. Stefani in your life. <br />She collaborates with Pharrell on \\"Orange County Girl\\", \\"Yummy\\", \\"Breakin' Up\\" and \\"U Started It\\".  <br />Other big names who contribute to the album include Akon on \\"The Sweet Escape\\" and No Doubt's Tony Kanal on \\"4 In the Morning\\", \\"Fluorescent and Don't Get It Twisted\\". Keane's Tim Rice-Oxley collaborated with Gwen on the smooth, soft rock \\"Early Winter\\".  <br />A mistress of the synthetic sound, with lyrics that allude to smart girlie conversations over a cuppa, Gwen's taken all the big hitters, ranging from Nellee Hooper to Keane's Tim Rice-Oakley to contribute. She's mixed them all up, soaking up trends that ensure she's played in all the gyms and Topshops nationwide, but she's not letting anyone take over. She's big enough for all of them. <br />Topics span apologising for being grumpy (\\"The Sweet Escape\\") men who lie, making her cry (the Cardigans-esque \\"Early Winter\\"), and being an unremarkable small town girl, a la J. Lo (\\"Orange County girl\\"). <br />As with her first album there are a few bland fillers, and she seems to lose her way a bit with \\"Breakin' up\\", a track about frustrating mobile conversations, but there's enough trademark majorette drumming to carry the album off. \\"Yummy\\" sums her up, coquettish, amusing, annoying and hip wiggling in equal measure. <br />\\"The Sweet Escape\\" lives up to the promise. Never afraid to try something new and create something completely fresh, Gwen succeeds in staying cutting edge.  <br />In this album she manages to create a sound that is simultaneously cutting edge and completely different to her older work, yet \\"The Sweet Escape\\" remains distinctly Gwen Stefani.  <br />An element of Gwen'ssuccess has to be ascribed to her collaborations with some industry bigwigs. She is unafraid to cross genres and draws inspiration from everyone she works with - resulting in an album that offers a great deal of varied sounds and influences. <br />  <br />All this and a new baby. Not bad. <br />Enjoy !
B000000OAN|5.0|Queen's album entitled A Night At The Opera remains one of the best rock albums to this day. Thirty one years after it was released on LP, people still snatch this up and Queen displays a strong ability to rock hard and yet be extremely creative in various styles of music as well. This CD proves it.<br /><br />The CD opens with the very rockin' \\"Death On Two Legs (Dedicated To...).\\" This song rocks hard and provides a strong beginning for the album. The melody holds your attention and Freddy Mercury's voice is strong and passionate. Awesome! The CD switches gears fast for a more laid back song entitled \\"Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon.\\" The arrangements are strong and Mercury sings this very well.<br /><br />Other classic rock songs on this album include \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\" which compares a car to a man's lover; the beautifully arranged pop music ballad called \\"You're My Best Friend\\" and the sweet folk rock tune called \\"'39.\\"<br /><br />\\"Seaside Rendezvous\\" is one of my favorite songs on this album. Far from being hard classic rock, this song's arrangement has a very \\"retro\\" love ballad melody to it that is also very playful. The playfulness and upbeat melody reminds me of the joys of new love. Excellent!<br /><br />No review of A Night A The Opera is complete without mention of the classic rock song \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" This song reveals what a young man is thinking after he makes a foolish and impulsive decision to kill someone. The song boasts dramatic operatic vocals and melodies; and I agree with the reviewer who writes that Brian May's guitar solo during this number is nothing short of mesmerizing. \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" remains one of the greatest classic rock pieces to this day. It will continue to be one he** of a show stopper for quite some time to come, too.<br /><br />Some reviewers write that the two final tracks, which are remixes of \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\" and \\"You're My Best Friend\\" are not very different from the original tracks.

B00005JPDJ|2.0|I like romantic comedies, I do. I enjoyed Nancy Meyers's Something's Got to Give and What Women Want. But there's got to be something in these movies besides beautiful people (in this case, two good-looking people, one somewhat attractive woman and a very ugly man).     I saw The Holiday expecting, well, some holiday fun and left utterly disappointed. The plot was predictable, the only interesting character was played by Jude Law (Diaz's character was simply unbelievable, Winslet's was pathetic, and don't even get me started on Jack Black...) and there wasn't anything remotely cute or funny about the movie.    As far as I'm concerned, The Holiday is a waste of talent and time.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I'm suspect of the ridiculous hype this offbeat time-travel film has received.  Yeah, the plot is a mind-bender and several viewings does clear up a few confusing points.  Yeah the acting is superior and Maggie looks great.  Yeah it has \\"cult fave\\" all over it; but just because it takes a few chances and defies a category doesn't mean it is a seminal or stellar piece of cinematic history. <br />The portrayal of the 80's is spot on and sparked a quick trip down memory lane.  Jake really took the role and ran with it.  He must've been exhausted after putting so much effort into this character.  A truly noteworthy job.   <br />I gave the movie 4-stars.  It's worth a purchase if only to assure the chance for several viewings. <br />
B000HEYVD6|1.0|I was surprised to see so many people claim Baldacci has \\"leftist\\" views.  To me it sounded like a rehashing of right wing demagoguery but whatever.<br /><br />The story was just boring.  And really, the author, like so many others, needs to stop relying on tv and film for his depictions of police procedurals.  The straw that, if you will, broke the camel's back for me was when the nanny (who is ONLY wanted for tying up her employer and taking the kids) is shot and killed because she's driving directly at a roadblock with THREE FLAT TIRES and won't slow down.<br /><br />Give me a break.  That's just one example of many.  I am SO disappointed because I have read several of Baldacci's books in the past and really enjoyed them.  This one is a stinker.  Don't bother.
B00005JPAD|5.0|The cast was perfect. The Acting was Great by everyone. Very well directed as usual from Martin Scorsese. Im not gonna talk about the plot just go watch it.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|When you see a video on MTV twice in a half hour, there is some serious over saturation of the market going on. What does that mean to you? Another insispid release from Gewn Stefani. The whole album's success is dependent on the single \\"Wind it up\\", otherwise why would we need to hear it twice in a half an hour? That song is terrible and on it's merit alone I would never buy this album. Having heard a burned copy, I decided to pass on this faux hip-pop train wreck. Lyrics have taken four steps back and sound like something Paris Hilton would pen and the music is only somewhat saved by the Neptunes and the track by Martin Gore. But even their music can't save this mind numbing trip into nowhere land..otherwise known as the the bargin bins for pop artists.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|An utterly fantastic album.  Virtually every song is politically charged, with the sort of poetic, insightful lyrics that we have come to expect from System.  Of course, as always, they strike that uniquely-SoaD balance between gritty, heavy metal thrash and lovely, haunting melodies. <br /> <br />Why is it not 5 stars? <br /> <br />Simply because the backup singer and lead guitarist, Daron, seems to be trying to share equally in vocal time with the signature lead singer Serj.  Not that he doesn't deserve perhaps a little bigger of a backup role; his vocal quality fits well with System's unorthodox sound.  But his voice is too flat and tinny, especially compared to Serj's rich vocals, to carry a song.  He is a great backup voice for the group, but frankly, I found myself on several songs wishing that his voice would just fade out so that I could hear Serj more clearly. <br /> <br />Ultimately this does not really ruin any of music though.  Every song is brilliant, melodic, and poetic, and their quality is obvious no matter who is singing them.  It is just that the recordings aren't quite as brilliant as they could otherwise have been. <br /> <br />Still, this album is very much worth buying, and is yet another fantastic album by this talented group.  Unless you are one of those inflexible purists who wish that they would make the same album over and over again, and never change their sound at all, you'll find that this album keeps all of the qualities that makes SoaD great while offering up something new and exciting.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|This had me dancing from end to end. A funky progression from Love Angel Music Baby! The only songs I didn't care too much for were Yummy, Breakin' Up and U Started It. Those could have just been left out. This album in no way compares with the material No Doubt produced.Wich was truly her golden moment.I miss No Doubt and I hope they make a comeback soon, but we have to keep in mind that's a whole DIFERENT GENRE! You cant't compare something in two different categories! To all those people that critiscize her for her age and the material she produced, there are plenty of female artist with kids and perhaps married with kids that are producing music that is geared for a younger audience and not their age group. i.e. Nelly Furtado who was born on 12/2/78, she's getting up there and has kids. Yet was is she singing about? Then there is Mariah Carey who was born on 3/27/70. What about Madonna. She was borm on 8/16/58. Don't get me wrong, I love Madonna, yet you have to admit some of her material can be out of her age.Yet you all are not chewing them up!!!THINK ABOUT THAT!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|One of my favorite albums ever; certainly one of the solidest of the solid Tool albums out there. Desert island fodder.
B000H0MKO2|4.0|corporations & thier lackeys, the lobbyists, are the good guys. The anti-smoking groups & individuals are evil & stupid. Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is a a pleasant, likeable guy. He has a gift of gab. He's a very good father & has b.s. to burn. Important to note. He loves his son & respects him as a person. His son an intelligent but quiet, reclusive child responds to the attention. Nick promotes the use of cigarettes or as he points out the promotion of free choice. His boss in this movie, says \\"they're cool they're available & they're addictive, they should sell themselves\\". Well, almost. An actual cigarette executive quote was, \\"Our future customers are poor, young, black & stupid\\".  Nick's life is threatened & he is almost killed in an unusaul way. He is kidnapped & literally, covered with nicotine patches, almost dying from an overdose. He recovers but is not longer allowed to smoke for health reasons. He becomes a sympathetic victim. The underlying message is, free choice, an idea that resonates well as a very American value. Lots of bit parts to go around: William Macy, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes & more. The dvd extras on the copy I viewed were excellent. A Charlie Rose Show with all the principals (writer, producer, director & star) was very worthwhile. Deleted scenes  were shown with an explanation why they were deleted. I thought that they did a very good job editing them out. A really fun movie with comedy from the dark side.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Good production. good package, good, solid work. Don't own any other Korn albums & never will.
B00005JPGM|5.0|I have never been a `huge' fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. Something about every one of his performances seems so calculated and unnatural. Yes, I realize every actor is `acting', but DiCaprio always seems like he is acting and is unable to take it that extra step and make it more believable.<br /><br />Watching first \\"The Departed\\" and now \\"Blood Diamond\\" has changed my conception of DiCaprio.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) works hard as a fisherman in his small village, trying to provide for his family and ensure his son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) goes to school. He wants his son to grow up and be a doctor. Walking his son home, Solomon notices a caravan of three vehicles overloaded with gun toting revolutionaries headed into his village. They immediately begin shooting and Solomon runs to his family, to protect them and get them to safety. But then he is caught. Instead of cutting his hands off, the leader of the revolutionary forces decides he would be better off working in the diamond mines. There, Solomon witnesses acts of brutality meant to keep any of the workers from stealing from the revolution. But Solomon finds a large pink diamond and realizes it will be worth a lot of money. He manages to hide it just before government forces invade and takes them all to jail. In jail, the commander starts yelling about Solomon's pink diamond and Danny Archer (DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler, believes the story. He soon makes Solomon his number one project and gets him released, trying to persuade him to give him the pink diamond. The more people who find out about it, the more their lives are in danger. In town, Danny meets Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), a journalist investigating conflict diamonds. She knows who Danny is and realizes he could be the break she needs for the story. He also recognizes how Maddy could help them. And Solomon realizes he can use the diamond to get his family back, provided they are still alive.<br /><br />I have only grazed the surface of the story in Edward Zwick's (\\"Glory\\", \\"The Last Samurai\\") new film \\"Blood Diamond\\"; that rare thing in Hollywood, and exciting message film that actually teaches us about the events behind the story.<br /><br />Zwick is a very good director. His films deal with complicated subjects in an exciting way, making them accessible to the masses of people who frequent multiplexes, but also illuminate these subjects, making them interesting to the same people who are taking a break from shopping at the Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch. Because he is able to deal with complicated subjects, and still make the characters interesting and the story accessible, his films are much better for it. People are more likely to retain information and knowledge if they are enjoying themselves or their interest is held. I can't say watching \\"Blood Diamond\\" is `fun', but it is well-made, exciting and holds your interest. One woman in the audience gasped audibly many times during the more shocking and graphic moments.<br /><br />DiCaprio has had a very strong year. First, he portrayed undercover agent Billy Costigan in Marin Scorcese's \\"The Departed\\" and now he plays Rhodesian diamond smuggler Danny Archer. Danny is a complex character. He is out for himself, always, because he is number one. Everything he does in his life is designed to somehow help him. Every relationship, every word he speaks, every move he makes is calculated to somehow get him money or advance his career. He has a network of people who assist him, but he can't trust them and realizes the only reason they are involved in his life is because of money. Gradually, throughout the film, we learn a little bit about his life and his upbringing. Danny hasn't had an easy life and this information makes the character all the more interesting and intriguing.<br /><br />The two people he meets over the course of the film are both pawns in his game to get more money. To a diamond smuggler, the very thought of a large pink diamond, the typeSolomon has found, is too much. He simply can't pass up the chance to try and find it and make it his. He starts to manipulate Solomon into revealing the whereabouts of the hidden diamond.<br /><br />But Solomon isn't stupid and recognizes Danny for what he is. As strong as DiCaprio is, Hounsou is better. From the first moments with his son, Hounsou shows us Solomon's dedication to his family. He loves them and every waking moment is spent providing for them and helping to make his children's life better. As soon as he sees the revolutionaries speeding towards his village, he knows he has to do something. Their presence will not be good news for the people. After he goes to work at the diamond mine, he witnesses how brutal these people are, yet, as soon as he finds the pink diamond, he has an opportunity and he takes it, realizing this rare stone could help him.<br /><br />As soon as Danny enters his life, Solomon knows what he wants, despite what the man tells him. Initially reluctant, Solomon comes to realize he can use Danny to help him. Danny is so set upon his goal, that Solomon can use this determination to help him get closer and closer to the diamond.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou has been in some impressive films, but this performance is heads and shoulders above the rest. Every moment he just exudes the determination we feel in Solomon; his number one goal is to get his family back and will do anything to make that happen.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly is less interesting as Maddy Bowen. As a journalist, she makes it a practice to travel to conflict situations in foreign countries, and get to the root of the story. Other journalists make comments about her ability to get in and out of these dangerous places with nary a scratch. So it is not surprising that Danny finds her in this part of Africa, as a civil war rages. Because of this ability, she writes for some high profile magazines and newspapers, her voice is heard. The most interesting thing about her is that she is certainly no angel either.<br /><br />As soon as she meets Danny, Maddy realizes he is the key to her new expose and needs the information he has to break the story wide open. She is willing to get that information at any cost. She helps Danny and Solomon, seduces Danny, uses her connections to get Solomon some help and more. Because she is willing to go to these lengths, her character is much more interesting. But in the end, Connelly has difficulty making this character anything more than a third wheel. So much of the story is about Danny and Solomon that Maddy is little more than a supporting character whenever she shows up.<br /><br />\\"Diamond\\" is filled with some terrific, exciting action scenes. Danny and Solomon are never allowed to rest for long and are frequently on the move, from Danny's former military commander, Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo, \\"The Mummy\\") and many other people, all of whom want that diamond to support their cause. Some of these scenes are so realistic looking it is amazing people weren't harmed during their filming.<br /><br />But \\"Diamond\\" also wants to get its message across and Zwick manages this with ease. Through brief exchanges and short montages, we learn the path these diamonds take to retail shops, the efforts people take to get them from the mines and why they are so important to these various groups, what they end up funding and more. These moments are fully integrated into the story and are usually quite brief, it seems like every time two characters start talking they are interrupted by bullet fire or an ambush or some type of action. Because the story keeps moving, and we are kept on our toes, we are entertained by every aspect of the film. This is a much different approach than some other filmmakers use (Spike Lee and Oliver Stone, I'm looking at you...). Other filmmakers are more likely to compose a series of monologues for their characters, in an effort to get the message across, but in the end, their messages just sound preachy and we don't really learn anything from the film. In the end, it is much more effective to provide an entertaining message, which will help the audience retain what you are getting across. Believe me, many of the images and events of \\"Blood Diamond\\" are seared on my mind.<br /><br />\\"Blood Diamond\\" is a very good film, featuring great performances from DiCaprio and Hounsou (if he isn't nominated for an Oscar, the awards are meaningless) and presents an entertaining story with memorable facts about one of the less known problems in the world.thing about her is that she is certainly no angel either. <br /> <br />As soon as she meets Danny, Maddy realizes he is the key to her new expose and needs the information he has to break the story wide open.

B00005JPDJ|2.0|There are two stories at work in Nancy Meyer's new film \\"The Holiday\\". One of these stories works, only occasionally veering into sitcom territory. The other stays firmly rooted in sitcom purgatory. Interestingly, the story that works also stars the better actress. I'll give you one hint. The better actress isn't Cameron Diaz.<br /><br />Amanda (Cameron Diaz), the owner of a company that edits movie trailers, breaks up with her boyfriend, Ethan (Edward Burns). Because Christmas is just around the corner, she doesn't want to spend the holiday alone, so she decides to travel. She explores a few websites and then comes across a home exchange program, decides on England and finds a photo of a cottage in Surrey, forty minutes outside of London. The owner of the cottage, Iris (Kate Winslet), a columnist at a London newspaper, is trying to come to terms with her unrequited love of Jasper (Rufus Sewell), another columnist at the paper. She still holds out hope, until his engagement to another woman is announced at the company Christmas party. That night, she receives an e-mail from Amanda. \\"Is your cottage still available?\\" The next day, each is jetting off to the other's countries. Iris is overjoyed to find Amanda's home has a large kitchen, a gym, a swimming pool and more. She immediately makes herself at home. She meets Arthur (Eli Wallach), an aging widower who lives next door. Arthur used to write movies, in the 40s, and Iris is immediately drawn into his tales of old Hollywood. One day, Miles (Jack Black), a film composer, stops by to pick up some of Ethan's things. After a while, they form a friendship and help each other deal with their respective relationship problems. In England, Amanda soon realizes the error of her thinking (naturally, the first thing you want to do to keep from feeling lonely is to fly to a foreign country, alone, for the holidays) and is ready to fly back to Los Angeles when Graham (Jude law), Iris' brother arrives on her doorstep. They immediately sleep together and Amanda decides England isn't such a bad place after all.<br /><br />\\"The Holiday\\" continues a trend established by writer - producer - director Nancy Meyers. For every hit, she follows with two or three flops. She made \\"Baby Boom\\" and followed that with some forgettable films. In the last few years, she has made \\"What Woman Want\\" and then \\"Something's Gotta Give\\", a critical and financial hit starring Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson in one of their best performances. So that makes \\"The Holiday\\" a...<br /><br />Actually, it isn't a flop. Not exactly. It is just extremely uneven.<br /><br />Let's start with the good.<br /><br />Kate Winslet has always been an extremely likable and believable actress. In each of her films, she is able to create a character we can believe in, even when the story veers off into fantastical realms. A large part of this ability comes from her extremely `normal' looks; Winslet is very pretty and nice to watch, but she isn't a bombshell. She looks like a normal person, which makes it easier to accept her in this type of role.<br /><br />As Iris, she makes the character sympathetic, interesting and intelligent. When she receives the news of Jasper's engagement, she travels home in a fog. Upon her arrival, she immediately lets the water works flow and she can't seem to stop. As soon as she arrives in Los Angeles, her joy at the sight of Amanda's home is almost palpable; most of us would also be overjoyed to find a mansion at our feet, ready to use for our holiday. When she meets Arthur, she befriends him out a mixture of human interest and neediness. After she gives him a ride home, she realizes he is a lonely old man and invites him to dinner where he begins to share stories of his days in old Hollywood and she becomes entranced.<br /><br />Then, she meets Miles. He is in a relationship with an actress, Maggie (Shannon Shassoman, \\"A Knight's Tale\\") and even though he feels a little bit of a spark, he is clearly in love with his girlfriend and just wants to be friends with Amanda. They form a bond as they work on an event featuring Arthur, growing closer and closer. Then, his relationship with Maggie changes and they each demonstrate their growing attraction.<br /><br />The key to this story, its believability, is that it is played fairly straight. There are occasional moments when it veers into sitcom territory, such as when Black starts singing the signature tunes of his favorite scores, but for the most part, it is believable, sweet and sincere.<br /><br />Black is also surprisingly good as Miles. It is by far his most natural, believable performance in many years. Because he is in a relationship with Maggie when he meets Iris, he isn't able to show his feelings. But there is an attraction there and they become friends, both becoming involved with Arthur's life. Then, when he realizes he has been cheated on, Miles realizes he has the perfect mate standing right in front of him.<br /><br />Both Iris and Miles share similar relationship troubles and they compliment each other nicely. When Mile`s ex-girlfriend says she wants him back, he naturally runs to her side, much like Iris is willing to drop everything for Jasper. The moment when they each realize their current relationships are not going to work is also handled well and believable. As they develop a bond, we watch with interest.<br /><br />Then there is the Amanda story. Two of the reasons Amanda's boyfriend cheats on her are: she is unable to cry and she is obsessed with work, to the point that she had an edit suite installed in her home. Meyers seems to feel these two items allow her license to make Amanda as much like Lucy Ricardo as possible. Throughout the film, we see shots of Cameron Diaz trying to cry, squinting her eyes up, in an attempt to be emotional. These come off as fake as they sound. Perhaps a more talented actress would have been able to make this work. Perhaps. Early in the film, Amanda visits her edit suite and watches the newest trailer her assistant has finished, an action film featuring Lindsay Lohan and James Franco (a nice touch of comedy since the actors are actually in the trailer and it appears to be very `Hollywood'.) Later, \\"Holiday\\" shows us a trailer version of Amanda's relationship woes, complete with grave, serious narration. Later, the narration returns, but no visual. They didn't take this joke far enough. It is a funny idea; naturally, anyone so obsessed with their job would begin to see everything in familiar terms. But to only see one trailer depicting her sad love life? This isn't enough.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Diaz is always talking, running off at the mouth, making Amanda an extremely annoying character. In every scene, she launches into a lengthy monologue about some state of her relationship with someone. Amanda and Graham start to make jokes about her incessant talking, but it doesn't make the character more believable. At one point, she complains about all of the books she hasn't read. Yeeeeesssshhhhh!<br /><br />The entire film is grounded in a world of fairy tales. From Iris' snow bound cottage to the fact both women jet off to a foreign country to share their homes the day after they meet, this is clearly not a story happening in the real world. At one point, after Iris meets Arthur, he talks about the \\"Meet Cute\\" moments in romantic comedies. \\"A man and a woman go to a department store. Each wants to buy pajamas, but the man says he just needs the bottoms and the woman says she just needs a top. That's a Meet Cute moment\\". \\"The Holiday\\" attempts its own Meet Cute. Graham arrives on Iris' doorstep stinking drunk. Because his sister left so quickly, he doesn't know she is gone until he meets Amanda. After a brief conversation, they realize neither wants a relationship, and Amanda is planning to leave the next day, so they, naturally, decide to sleep together. This is a phenomenally bad idea. Not only does it rob the film, or at least this story's part of the film, of any romance, it makes both Amanda and Graham slightly unlikable. Yes, Graham is good looking and Amanda is attractive, but why would they sleep together five minutes after they meet? The relationship has nowhere to go from there, except down.<br /><br />Because Jude Law's Graham is in the Amanda story, he naturally suffers by association. But Meyers is clearly trying to amp up the charming factor of Law's persona. Many people have compared him to Cary Grant and \\"The Holiday\\" seems to be trying to encourage this. Graham is from Surrey, where Cary Grant was born, a fact not lost on the film as it is mentioned in the dialogue. Then, in one scene, Law dons glasses which look extremely similar to the same type of glasses worn by Grant in the classic Howard Hawk's comedy \\"Bringing Up Baby\\", yet another fact I doubt is lost on Meyers. So, throughout the film, Law appears charming and attractive and every bit the leading man he should be. If he would only appear in better films.<br /><br />Eli Wallach has a sweet turn as Arthur, the aging widower living next door to Amanda. As he and Iris form a friendship, Iris learns the Writer's Guild has been pestering him to let them host a salute to him. She also learns they want to do it next week, yet another fairy tale element of the film. This allows for Iris to still be in town for the big event, but is a completely implausible story point. These types of events take months to plan. That aside, it allows for Arthur and Iris to work towards this event and the moment Arthur steps into the auditorium is a nice moment.<br /><br />The final moment of \\"The Holiday\\" is easily the worst conclusion I have seen in a film all year. It almost seems like Meyers had no idea how to end the film, felt it was necessary to have at least one scene with both Winslet and Diaz and came up with what ends the film. It doesn't work. At all. It seems like one of those bad films from the 60s or 70s, when all of the main characters start dancing at the end of the film, as though there is simply not enough money left to shoot that final scene, the one that provides a resolution to the story. Yes, it seems exactly like that.<br /><br />\\"The Holiday\\" is a mixed bag. Some might enjoy the story with Iris and her two friends,  and Arthur. But you will have to sit through an interminable amount of overacting on the part of Cameron Diaz. I'm not sure the film is worth that agony.Amanda visits her edit suite and watches the newest trailer her assistant has finished, an action film featuring Lindsay Lohan and James Franco (a nice touch of comedy since the actors are actually in the trailer and it appears to be very `Hollywood'.)

Not onlydoes it rob the film, or at least this story's part of the film, of any romance, it makes both Amanda and Graham slightly unlikable. Yes, Graham is good looking and Amanda is attractive, but why would they sleep together five minutes after they meet? The relationship has nowhere to go from there, except down. <br /> <br />Because Jude Law's Graham is in the Amanda story, he naturally suffers by association. But Meyers is clearly trying to amp up the charming factor of Law's persona. Many people have compared him to Cary Grant and \\"The Holiday\\" seems to be trying to encourage this. Graham is from Surrey, where Cary Grant was born, a fact not lost on the film as it is mentioned in the dialogue. Then, in one scene, Law dons glasses which look extremely similar to the same type of glasses worn by Grant in the classic Howard Hawk's comedy \\"Bringing Up Baby\\", yet another fact I doubt is lost on Meyers. So, throughout the film, Law appears charming and attractive and every bit the leading man he should be. If he would only appear in better films. <br /> <br />Eli Wallach has a sweet turn as Arthur, the aging widower living next door to Amanda. As he and Iris form a friendship, Iris learns the Writer's Guild has been pestering him to let them host a salute to him. She also learns they want to do it next week, yet another fairy tale element of the film. This allows for Iris to still be in town for the big event, but is a completely implausible story point. These types of events take months to plan. That aside, it allows for Arthur and Iris to work towards this event and the moment Arthur steps into the auditorium is a nice moment. <br /> <br />The final moment of \\"The Holiday\\" is easily the worst conclusion I have seen in a film all year. It almost seems like Meyers had no idea how to end the film, felt it was necessary to have at least one scene with both Winslet and Diaz and came up with what ends the film. It doesn't work. At all. It seems like one of those bad films from the 60s or 70s, when all of the main characters start dancing at the end of the film, as though there is simply not enough money left to shoot that final scene, the one that provides a resolution to the story. Yes, it seems exactly like that. <br /> <br />\\"The Holiday\\" is a mixed bag. Some might enjoy the story with Iris and her two friends,  and Arthur. But you will have to sit through an interminable amount of overacting on the part of Cameron Diaz. I'm not sure the film is worth that agony.   <br />
B00005JPE9|3.0|Saw it yesterday at a sneak preview showing. <br />Rocky Balboa is one of the most likable characters ever, so he's easy to root for in any situation. But in this installment, there is really nothing on the line.  He isn't fighting for anything.  The fight falls flat because of it.  Even if he gets his head smashed in, its expected.  If he beats the heavyweight champ, it's ridiculous.  Sort of a no-win. <br />The lack of Adrian was noticable and sad.  They try to fill the female void with a kid from his past who is now a single mother, but that relationship ultimately leads nowhere, despite being a very substantial portion of the film.   <br />I got the sense in the theater, which was packed, that everyone was waiting to go nuts and get excited, as Rocky has made us all do in the past.  But that moment never came. <br />While Stallone looks great for a guy his age, Rocky looks slow, old, and ridiculous at times.  Had they done this movie 10-15 yrs ago, and made it the 5th and final installment, it probably would have done the series good.
B000ASATYO|5.0|In the good 'ol days of laserdiscs (analog DVDs on steriods) one of the most sought-after limited-run sets was Universal's Director's Cut of THE FRIGHTENERS. Sets sold on eBay for as much as $400. Why? This movie is top-drawer Peter Jackson!  <br /> <br />This cut darkens an already dark plotline and goes places the rated theatrical version could not, even kinky ones! Furthermore, it will give your surround audio system a SERIOUS, house-shaking workout! The sub-bass effects are great! <br /> <br />This movie, while it never found an audience, is well worth the time.

0743457900|4.0|Following in the tradition of Graham Greene, who wrote spy novels contemporaneous with his own, John LeCarre uses his experience in the foreign service and MI6 to add realism to his tales of espionage.  Green, however, remained a friend of traitor Kim Philby and continued to send his novels to Philby after Philby defected to Russia. LeCarre was betrayed by Philby to Russian agents, and his career was ended.  This betrayal gives added realism to his novels, which show real disillusionment with the system and, sometimes, with its agents and officials.<br /><br />Written in 1974, this novel draws on the real life of \\"LeCarre\\" (real name David Cornwell) and many of his associates who were unmasked by Philby and the \\"Cambridge Five.\\" Here LeCarre creates a vivid and morally probing story in which his hero, George Smiley, is called out of his enforced retirement to unmask a Soviet \\"mole\\" high in the British secret service, referred to as \\"the circus.\\"  Five men (as in the real betrayal) have been suspected of aiding the Soviets.  Drawing on his friendships with some of the agents who were dismissed when he was, Smiley investigates the security leaks which have led to humiliation for British intelligence and real danger for some of its agents.  As he tries to identify the mole, he receives peripheral help from Sir Oliver Lacon of the British Foreign Office.<br /><br />Written in formal and polished prose, the novel is full of Cold War complexities.  Karla, the legendary head of Soviet intelligence, continues to control a small group of Soviet \\"defectors\\" and \\"disillusioned\\" Communists, whom the British mistakenly regard as double agents providing them with secret information.  At the same time, British Control (who is never identified by name) is trying to uncover the Soviet mole (nicknamed \\"Gerald\\") within their own agency.  Jim Prideaux, who appears in several Smiley novels, is working on this operation in Czechoslovakia when he is betrayed and almost killed, his entire operation shut down, and many of his agents executed by the Russians.<br /><br />Smiley's investigations are decidedly prosaic, not the exciting shoot-'em-ups of James Bond novels.  Slogging through mountains of paperwork, interviewing reluctant former agents, and doing his own legwork, Smiley works at unmasking Gerald the hard way.  The complexity of his character (and of the other characters here) make up for the relative lack of dramatic action and highlight LeCarre's skill at creating intriguing characters who see the \\"grays\\" in an otherwise black-and-white world.  His dialogue is quick-paced, often witty, and revelatory of subtle character traits, adding to the depth of the portraits and to the intricacies of the world of spy/counterspy. n  Mary Whippledown, and many of his agents executed by the Russians.

B000IOM1RI|5.0|First off, I have yet to see The Pick of Destiny in the theaters, but if you've seen it (and enjoyed it), this CD is a great addition to your collection - if you're into collecting soundtracks. <br /> <br />If you're a Tenacious D fan, this CD will immediately be right up there with their first, self-titled album.   <br /> <br />Right from the beginning of the CD, \\"Kickapoo\\" has JB singing a great 'story,' to include cameos by Meatloaf, and his royal highness, Dio.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great CD with perhaps 1 flawed song (I'm not a fan of \\"Baby,\\").  If you're into The D, you need to get it.  If you're not into Jack Black and Kyle Gass music and comedy, you might just want to let this one pass you by.
B00003OSU4|5.0|this is by far the best quality and footage I have seen of the <br />older jazz concerts. Color and sound are excellent, and it's <br />the best footage I have seen of Pop's and Mahalia. By contrast <br />the 62 festival is terrible in quality- poor sound and film. <br />It is annoying to cut away from the some of the performances, <br />but again it is still the best quality I have seen. If someone  <br />has anything better out there, tell us about it.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is simply the best Xmas album I have ever heard.  Who else would have thought of including \\"River\\" as a Xmas song?  Not only did she include it, she actually sings it better than Joni Mitchell did; it's hard to top Joni Mitchell on a Joni Mitchell song.<br /><br />Although there are a lot of traditional songs on this album (which she covers beautifully), the inclusion of non-traditional songs is what stands out for me.  Well worth any price.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|Finally, another metal album worth the money spent to purchase it. <br /> <br />Metal hit a dry spell for a really long time with mainstream pop-metal bands that nearly sank the genre back into the dark ages. <br /> <br />\\"The Fall of Ideals\\" starts off with a bang and keep going throughout. <br /> <br />From headcrushing double-bass lines, to wild guitars, to melodic vocals (mixed with snarling ones too)... this album delivers a true experience. <br /> <br />Metal and Non-Metal fans alike can enjoy this album for years to come.  Put this in your CD player, hit shuffle, and repeat.  You could be satisfied for hours!
B000GPIPSS|5.0|A man named Renfield is found, the sole survivor on a boat full of dead crew. His eyes are wild and staring, and he has an appetite for flies, spiders and rats. Doctors are baffled as to what made him this way. Does it have something to do with Count Dracula, a man who has just bought the local crumbling abbey? Is Renfield's condition connected to blood loss in various London folk and the two red marks on their neck?     I'm not a big fan of vampire stories or films, not really at all, but I do like the 1931 version of \\"Dracula\\", starring Bela Lugosi. Bela plays it in a very detached way, but strangely still like a gentleman. Though it created the vampire stereotype, there's nothing cliched about the way he handles himself. Renfield is an interesting character too, torn between so many different desires. I also like the film's long, empty silences.
0553582445|5.0|I feel I must preface this \\"review\\" by stating at the outset that it is not really a review at all; in truth, it is more like a personal journal entry.  That said, for those of you still interested, or for those of you just curious as to how a Robin Hobb fan's Amazon.com \\"personal\\" journal entry might read, I invite you to read on. <br /> <br />Prior to my discovering Robin Hobb, my familiarity with the fantasy genre was casual at best.  The genre-fiction I read most tends to be science fiction; indeed, the few works that I've read over the years apart from SF, the ones that might justly be described as \\"fantasy\\", were usually of the so-called \\"science-fantasy\\" variety.  Stuff like Gene Wolfe's vast \\"Sun\\" series; Herbert's Dune; and more recently, David Zindell's satisfying (if formulaic) Tolkien-esque \\"Ea Cycle\\".  As such, I consider Robin Hobb's Farseer saga my first serious foray into a true, through-and-through fantasy series.  I suppose I just reached a point in my sci-fi reading where I could no longer abide the weak characterization that (all too often) one finds in the genre's lesser offerings.  So I decided it was time for a change.  <br /> <br /> I then spent a week or so doing some research online to try and determine whether there is any sort of consensus out there about who's leading the pack of modern fantasy writers.  As anyone who knows anything about the genre well knows, fantasy, like science-fiction, is fairly besieged with hackery.  Searching through the dross for a safe-bet author to spend your time and money on can be a frustrating ordeal, and I'm sure has turned many a would-be SF or fantasy fan off the hunt for good.  Thankfully, I persevered.  In the course of my \\"research\\" I found that two names kept coming up: Robin Hobb and George R.R. Martin.  I've yet to read Martin, though I plan to.  I'm a little embarrassed to admit this, but my eventual decision to take my first chance with Hobb was based in nothing other than the fact that a fairlyworn copy of \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\" happened to be available at a nearby bookshop one day for a few dollars less than a better preserved copy of Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\".  <br /> <br />I've never written a review for fellow Amazon customers before.  I suppose this is because I've never felt absolutely compelled to.  I do now.  I just finished \\"Fool's Fate\\" last night, and I must say, I've never before been this emotionally moved by a work of fiction.  I've attached this review (such as it is) to \\"Fool's Errand\\", book 1 of Hobb's \\"Tawny Man\\" series, because it was by far the volume that most completely enthralled (and destroyed) me.  There are scenes in this book (one in particular) that literally had me sobbing.  Now, I consider myself to be a fairly sensitive guy; I've squeezed the odd tear here and there at a sad movie.  But I have never been reduced to full-on sobbing.  I attribute this 100% to the mastery of Hobb's prose, and indeed, to the beautiful meditation on love, duty, and above all friendship that is her wondrous Farseer saga. <br /> <br />For anyone out there who might similarly be pondering taking that first chance on the fantasy genre I would urge you to let Hobb be your emissary; she will not disappoint you.  And if I may offer two final pieces of advice: start at the beginning with \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\"; and don't read this series in a hurry.  True, you can always go back and re-savour it a second time through; but the first time is special, and only happens once.

B000A2XC1C|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was young and I spent a while looking for it on DVD. As soon as I saw the 20th Anniversary Edition released, I grabbed it!! I may be a little biased because Christmas is my favorite season, but I guarantee this could be a holiday favorite for anyone.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|As a kid MIami Vice was my favorite. It was my reason for moving to Miami.The movie plays like the TV show just upated. You are expected to not be in the dark on the characters are. This is not a how they met movie.Several reviewers said it doesn't have enough action, well then they didn't watch the show knowing what to expect. It's an under cover movie which generally involve this thing called a plot. The acting does have some bad moments and the casting may not have been on point, but as in the show, the city was a character in the movie. This movie was made for the fan of the show and like I said this was a favorite when I was 5 I said when I grow up I'm gonna move to Miami and I did
B000B5IPLK|4.0|Although I've already seen Alicia Keys at an unforgettable 2004 music concert, I decided to buy her third album, \\"Alicia Keys: Unplugged\\", simply because I'm a big fan of hers. Hell, just to hear her vibrantly soulful vocals further enliven R&B/Soul classics like \\"Fallin'\\", \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" & \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" was well worth the money I forked out to purchase this album. \\"Alicia Keys: Unplugged\\", which temporarily revives MTV's long-gone \\"Unplugged\\" series, further testifies to Alicia Keys' immense talent as a singer, songwriter and musician. Unfortunately, this album does not live up to the greatness of its two predecessors (\\"Songs In A Minor\\" - 2001, \\"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\\" - 2004). <br /> <br />That doesn't necessarily mean that this album is terrible because it's anything but. Alicia Keys consistently sounds as soulful, powerful, emotional and captivating as she's always been -especially on \\"Fallin'\\", \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" & \\"A Woman's Worth\\"- but I was hoping that she'd apply some more creativity and/or effort into the musical and/or instrumental arrangements. Apart from the \\"the stripped-down \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" and the insightful soul ballad \\"Diary\\", which chucks in a laid-back flute, the songs hardly sound any different from their original forms. I guess she preferred to stick to the \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" theory this time `round. <br /> <br />Another thing that I disliked about this album was its lack of new material. Yes, lead single \\"Unbreakable\\" is a beautiful R&B/Soul tune, but with all the name-dropping going on in the lyrics, I find it hard to find out what she's really talking about. The only other solid new tune on this 16-track-long disc is \\"Stolen Moments\\", another beautiful R&B/Soul ballad where Alicia Keys ponders on the beginnings of her loving relationship and grandly urges to her lover \\"lets get away\\" over a beautiful assortment of horns, flute and percussion. Apart from hits and songs from her past, as well as aguest-festive celebration with Common, Mos Def, Damian Marley & others on the album-closing tracks \\"Love It Leave It Alone\\" & Damian Marley's \\"Welcome To Jamrock\\", the rest of the songs consist of covers (Branda Holloway's piano-driven \\"Every Little Bit Hurts\\" & \\"Prince's \\"You Don't Know My Name\\"). However, there's no denying the sheer sublimeness and brilliance of her piano-driven duet with Maroon 5's Adam Levine on their cover of the Rolling Stone's \\"Wild Horses\\", which beautifully converts a Rock song into a spiritually exploratory R&B/Soul classic. Ditto in terms of brilliance for \\"Streets If New York (City Life)\\", a stunning piece of deeply thought-provoking poetry over a beautifully arranged melange of moody instrumentals. <br /> <br />The final problem I had with this album was with her lacklustre performances of \\"Heartburn\\" & \\"Karma\\". It's a shame that she started off a great show on the wrong foot by turning two beautiful songs into vocal trainwrecks, especially after beautifully opening the show with \\"Alicia's Prayer (Acapella Intro)\\".  <br /> <br />Nonetheless, this is a great CD and is well worth the purchase, despite its flaws. It's solid proof of Alicia Keys' raw talent to the haters and misinformed individuals who believe otherwise. 4 stars! <br />
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I LOVE MY SWIVEL SWEEPER! I have to say that I was pretty upset after reading all the bad reviews on this thing while waiting for it to arrive. I figured I got a good deal on it so if it didn't work, I didn't lose TOO much money.  <br /> <br />As soon as it arrived I plugged in the charger and let the battery charge for atleast 8 hours as recommended in the instructions. I couldn't help but see all the cat hair I had on my carpet (I have a long hair Himalayan who sheds), so I thought I'd test it out after about 9 hours went by. I was a bit concerned when I turned it on thinking, there's no way this is going to get anything out of the carpet! I was wrong, immediately I saw that it does a great job. I was under the impression that it would be pretty quiet, but it's definitely not! Then again, neither are most vacuums anyways. Not only did it get the cat hair off the carpet but it also picked up a lot of other dirt that I could barely see, as well as cat litter around the box! My cat always leaves bits of food on the floor and his food mat, so I also use this to suck it up.  <br /> <br />I have now had this sweeper for nearly a year and it still works great! The battery still holds it's charge and nothing is broken. This sweeper is just that, an ELECTRIC sweeper. If you are used to sweeping with a broom, or dust pan, this will replace that and more. Though it will never take place of your vacuum, but it will come pretty close depending on the mess. <br /> <br />The sweeper is very light and can be used in small spaces. I love that it goes under areas my vacuum doesn't. Keep in mind that most infomercials pump up their product to look better than it is. So don't have high hopes, again it WILL NOT replace your vacuum. I do feel that it should be sold for less, for those who are buying it at the full price. I recommend checking out eBay. I got mine for less than $20 (without shipping). <br /> <br />I don't understand why so many people are having trouble with theirs. Perhaps faulty pieces or not charging it properly. Overall, I definitely recommend the Swivel Sweeper. It truly comes in handy!
0446677450|5.0|Despite the fact this book is being trashed by a few outspoken \\"poor dads\\" is not only to be expected, it is just a bit humorous.  Why would a book about improving yourself make some people so mad?  Either the book or Kiyosaki himself are called overly simplistic, inaccuate, or even disingenuous.  But when the sour grapes are put aside and the book is taken on its own merits, it deserves a high rating for getting its point across.  If you're broke and looking for a way to change your stars, ignore the naysayers, put this book on a top 10 list, and get to reading.  If it encourages you to take even one step in a positive direction, it will have done its job.<br /><br />This book is about choosing to model financially successful people (whether your own parents or someone else's). \\"Poor dad\\" and \\"rich dad\\" are presented as two different men with two different approaches to money, wealth, and career, both of whom are advising a young man as he grows up.  The book is typified by the story of \\"poor dad\\" who encourages his son to climb the corporate ladder;  \\"rich dad\\" responds, \\"I'd rather own the ladder.\\"<br /><br />The central message of the book is also simple:  \\"The idea that it takes money to make money is the thinking of financially unsophisticated people. . . Money is only an idea.  If you want more money simply change your thinking.\\"  This is not rocket science;  it is a matter of some basic information and of self-control.<br /><br />The book talks a lot about real estate, because that is Kiyosaki's background. But the book isn't about real estate; it's about learning to think about money in a different way and about adjusting your approach to meet your own goals.<br /><br />Lessons learned from rich dad include the following basic points:  Don't work for money, make money work for you;  become literate about finances; take care of your business; learn how taxes work for corporations, then adopt that for yourself; learn how to invent money, like the rich;  and work to learn, don't work for money.  Each of these concepts is duscussed and illustrated in interesting ways.  Against those who object that this is all \\"common sense,\\" it is NOT common sense to people who don't know it!  And, after all, the book was written for those readers, not for people who already know everything.<br /><br />Learning how to overcome obstacles is central to success:  \\"The main reason most people are not rich is becase they are terrified of losing.  Winners are not afaid of losing.  But losers are.  Failure is part of the process of success.  People who avoid failure also avoid success.\\"  The critics are (naturally) yelping \\"Hype!\\" at statements like this.  Just ignore these \\"poor dads\\" who can't stand other people's success, and who want to interfere with yours, and soak up all you can from this book before going to the next.<br /><br />The book is full of enthusiastic encouragement, but it is more than hype:  it's an entry to a new way of thinking about yourself and money.  There are helpful diagrams, tips, stories, and directions.<br /><br />To get started, Kiyosaki urges readers to (1) focus on your heart's desire; (2) make wise choices; (3) be picky about the company you keep (e.g., \\"Don't listen to poor or frightened people\\"); (4) learn fast, and then keep learning while you adapt;  (5) Pay yourself first (\\"I would venture to say that it is the lack of personal self discipline that is the No. 1 delineating factor between the rich, poor and the middle class\\"); (6) pay your brokers well (i.e., don't be chincy with the people who bring you to the dance);  (7) focus on ROI (return on investment), and learn to ask, \\"How fast do I get my money back?\\";  (8) use assets to buy luxuries (stop burning a hole in your pocket to get the things you want); (9) have heros (role-models -- they make things look easy, but they show you the path);  and (10) learn the power and importance of giving back.<br /><br />Again, it is no secret that Kiyosaki has beenattacked as a fraud in numerous forums.  I do not know the man, but I appreciate the book enormously and recommend it highly to anyone struggling to improve your life.  Despite certain negative claims, Rich Dad, Poor Dad is not anti-education, does not encourage people to be stupid in making career or financial decisions, and is not unsound in its advice. It presents itself as an \\"attitude adjustment\\" about money, and that is just what it is.<br /><br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad is not perfect or the only book you should read on this subject.  But it is helpful, encouraging, inspirational, informational, and worth a top 10 spot for those looking to improve your financial life.  Ignore the \\"poor dads\\" and read the book.<br /><br />By the way, one thing rarely mentioned about this book:  the Co-Author of this book is Sharon Lechter, a successful CPA in her own right.  Her 10 page introduction is well worth reading.he man, but I appreciate the book enormously and recommend it highly to anyone struggling to improve your life.

B000HC2LIK|4.0|This is one of those flicks you must watch more than once.  Harrison Ford is good in this.  But the most important thing about this movie isn't the storyline because it doesn't develop THAT well.  But the most important part of this movie is the music and scenery.  The idea is pretty good too.  I can't give it 5 stars because I almost had to force myself to finish.  Almost.  Which was another downer; The Ending.  It just kind of stops outta know where.  It leaves some unanswered questions.  Overall though, it's worth seeing, even buying for the low price it is at now.
0618680004|5.0|(\\"The God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins, 2006)<br /><br />As many would suspect, reviews of this book largely depend on what side of the fence one stands before reading it.  Longtime atheists/humanists/freethinkers etc. will tend to be supportive, while theists/fundamentalists/religious apologists will be dismissive.  The amounts of praise or vitriol will vary, but (based on some of the reviews I've looked at here) many reacted to the book sight unseen.  I'll save the lectures about the differences between product reviews and message boards for, well, the message boards, and I for one will review the actual book.<br /><br />I will admit up front that I fall on the atheist side of the fence, and rather proudly so.  However, I promise to myself--and yes, to you, dear Amazon shopper--to be neutral while evaluating the merits of Mr. Dawkins latest book.  There have been more than a few pro-atheism books that are nothing more than hastily written blogs with faulty reasoning and just plain no reason at all except to express disdain and contempt for belief.  Many have already accused Mr. Dawkins of doing just that, but, again, they probably haven't bothered to read a single page of the book.  What I found in the \\"The God Delusion\\" was instead was not just a meticulous dissection of religious belief but also a passionate defense of the wonderment of the scientific outlook.  Central to his outlook is Mr. Dawkins' specialty, Darwinian evolution by natural selection.  Dawkins asserts that the theory can explain not just the diversity of life on earth, but also it's origin.  Evolution teaches that complexity, over the course of millions of years (we are asked to contemplate just what that number means) can arise from simplicity.  So simple, as a matter of fact, that it's \\"simply\\" more basic than tossing a supernatural deity into the equation, since a \\"god\\" capable of creating such complexity ex nihlo would have to be vastly more complicated.  Theists decline to even approach this question.<br /><br />Many have also accused Dawkins of having an overly harsh tone, saying he's just as intolerant as the most cartoonish of fire-and-brimstone preacers.  Seemingly anticipating such criticism, Dawkins offers an entire chapter on the subject (ch. 8), \\"What's wrong with religion? Why be so hostile?\\"  Since many apologists insist that religion and science are just \\"separate magisteria,\\" and therefore perfectly compatible, Dawkins asks why most faiths make claims that are overtly scientific.  That most of these claims are contradicted by fact should make them dissipate, but these bad ideas continue to contaminate the legal codes of many \\"enlightened\\" countries such as the U.S. (the name Bush comes up more than once).<br /><br />Dawkins is actually more interested in discussing morality, and why religion is unnecessary in explaining and perpetuating it.  Dawkins, using evolutionary psychology as a basis, explains why people can be inherently altruistic.  Since, at the dawn of homo sapiens, we were all part of the gene pool, protecting one another was a biological imperative, and this continues to this day, even though the gene pool has considerably diversified.  Dawkins discusses why atheistic evildoers (Stalin, Mao) didn't act out of unbelief--really, they didn't seek to eliminate faith, just faith that contradicted their self-declared supremacy.<br /><br />At the heart of \\"The God Delusion\\" is a passionate defense of the principles of science and reason.  It's almost regrettable that this book is perceived as simply \\"atheistic,\\" since Dawkins delight at the wonders of the universe is so effective that he could influence many children on a path to knowledge at a time when the West seems to be losing its interest in scientific development, even as such matters are increasingly essential to our continued survival.  Dawkins asks, in a non-pedantic manner, to please consider the possibilities before rushing to fill the breach with ancient superstitions.I myself even \\"believe\\" that he could actually change the minds of many fence sitters and even religious moderates toward a more reasoned worldview (fundamentalists are, sadly, lost in the wilderness of an ideology whose cirular illogic has blotted out the world beyond).

B000HBKCDC|4.0|This is the first CD of Sarah's I've purchased, and I'm impressed with her voice as well as with her interpretation of the songs on this album. She shows some creativity with the melodies that I mostly found refreshing, particularly with \\"What Child is This?\\", which is my favorite track on the disc. <br /> <br />Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" and Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\" were welcome additions to my ears, and brought a touch of nostalgia to this 50-something reviewer's heart. <br /> <br />Overall I found that the songs convey the wonder, the peace and the simplicity that are a powerful reminder of the true Christmas spirit.  This album serves as a prophetic voice in the midst of the busyness, noise and commercialism that are hard to escape this time of the year.   <br />
0618680004|5.0|I read this because I'm already an atheist - I was just interested in reading Dawkins logical approach to the subject. <br />I'd challenge agnostics (at least) to read it. I'd say it's asking too much to expect Bible/Koran thumping types to pick this up. <br />It's hard going in places, even for those who've read his other books on evolution, but generally Dawkins steps through his arguments very well.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|As I read the past negative reviews, I can see that these people have no concept of science.  I'm a conservative republican and never thought I would side with Al Gore on ANY issue.  Yes, I'm one of those \\"right-wingers\\", love Fox news, Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter.  But as a scientist, specifically a chemist, this movie explains in layman's terms the Science of global warming.  I was most impressed.  Yes, he talks negatively about the current Administration, the loss of the 2000 election, as well as personal matters, but this is done to explain his story about how he's trying to change other people's perceptions.  Get over political party affiliations and look at the science!<br /><br />This video goes through the basic science of global warming.  He also explains what has happened in the past and makes a persuasive prediction for the future.  Mr. Gore demonstrates the cause and effect of altering our atmosphere by changing weather patterns and ocean currents.  I experienced 7 of the 10 typhoons that hit Japan in 2004 that Al talks about in the film...that wasn't fun.  He provides ways to improve our situation, one person and household at a time.  The one thing he doesn't explain is the effect of the massive human population explosion.  We are our worst enemy by consuming so many resources.  Look in your garbage can after one day to see all the waste and unnecessary packaging.<br /><br />All Americans need to take their own \\"political agenda blinders\\" off and stop seeing what you just want to see.  We all need to come together and change the course we're on.

B00000AFFI|5.0|I am a newcomer to the wonder that is PJ Harvey, having been a fan of Nick Cave for a while, and hearing her vocals on Murder Ballads, i just had to check her out. This is the second album i bought of hers, and my favourite of the two i own. My first remark is that this is a woman not afraid to really sing, and i mean it. In many respects though quite a feminine voice, she sings in a very masculine way, which adds to her charm. The album itself is a mix of solemn ballads and quite jumpy dance techo themes (i dunno if that's the right term). My favourite of them is probably A perfect Day Elise, in many ways reminiscent of Cave's songwriting style. All in all, a difficult one to get into but good for fans

B000HCO83Q|5.0|If given more time, this movie would have been better than the final result, but the final result is still really good. I understood the plot and what the film was trying to tell us through symbolism the way an X-Men story should. Some characters do \\"die\\" in this movie, but in the world of the X-Men, they are always brought back. Characters have died in the comics and came back, and the small clip at the end of the credits of this movie proves that dead doesn't always mean dead.<br /><br />I thought they made good use of the special effects of the film. One of the most beautiful parts of the movie was watching Angel fly over the bridge. The special effects really came in use at the exciting battle scene towards the end of the movie. You hear about the war coming in the previous two movies and now it is finally hear and it makes for a good watch that isn't boring.<br /><br />The acting is also as great as in the other films as well. There are some powerful scenes such as when Logan and Storm are crying over one of their friends who had died. Overall, if you are a fan of the series, then you owe it to yourself to get the DVD. No; it isn't the best in the series, but if you love the X-Men movies and are like me, then you will probably like this as well.
0618551050|5.0|Some parts of this book are better than others, but I'll give it 5 stars anyway-- I've been thinking about the book constantly since finishing it a few days ago, so Smolin must be doing something right as an author. <br /> <br />As a general rule, I find the early parts of the book to be the strongest. Smolin begins with a refreshingly candid confession that physics has made little fundamental progress since the standard model was formulated in 1973. This arrow is aimed at the author himself as much as at the string theorists. He deserves credit for being so blunt rather than beginning with propaganda for his own position. <br /> <br />Smolin then moves on to a lucid overview of key milestones in the history of physics. Along the way, he prepares us for his critique of string theory with some wonderful examples of mathematically beautiful/elegant theories in the history of science that still went nowhere (Kepler's link between astronomy and the Platonic solids is one fine instance). He also gives a marvellous summary of what he regards as the five outstanding unsolved problems in physics. His list is a masterpiece of popular science writing. Even the most untutored member of the general public would be fascinated by Smolin's crystalline presentation here. <br /> <br />I also thought his basic criticism of string theory and string theorists was a badly needed counterpoint to the wave of pro-string books already available. Presumably, most readers who pick up Smolin's book will already be familiar with Brian Greene's pro-string bestseller *The Elegant Universe*, meaning that string theory will already have had equal time. I did find Smolin to be a touch defensive in this part of the book, always trying a little too hard to prove to us that he wasn't always opposed to string theory, that he still takes it seriously as part of a many-hued palette of possible approaches to fundamental physics, and so forth. I don't doubt his sincerity about all of this, I just found thedefensiveness a bit distracting at times. <br /> <br />Next comes Smolin's overview of possible alternative theories. This is both the most interesting and most poorly executed part of the book. On the positive side, I learned all sorts of names and theories that were unfamiliar to me before. Doubly special relativity (not only is the speed of light constant for all observers, but the tiny \\"Planck length\\" is constant for all observers as well) is just one of the fascinating ideas that Smolin presents. However, his presentations here are a bit rushed, and contain an insufficient account of loop quantum gravity, apparently Smolin's own favorite approach. <br /> <br />The book ends with Smolin's sociological remarks on the state of academic physics departments. I'm a university professor in the humanities, and many of Smolin's complaints hold equally true for my own field. But I was not convinced by his argument that there is a unique scoiological crisis connected with the dominance of the string theorists. Consider philosophy, for instance, where no one outside the \\"analytic philosophy\\" mainstream has a ghost of a chance of being hired at any of the most prestigious universities in the English-speaking world. Many of Smolin's friends do seem to make painful career sacrifices to follow their lonely stars, but they all sound better off than the young Einstein was.  <br /> <br />Smolin points accurately to some of the real problems with the sociology of university life, and seems filled with scorn for those who think that nothing can be done about it. Yet his dearth of feasible practical suggestions leads me to believe that, in fact, nothing *can* be done about it. There will always be some hegemonic doctrine in any given academic field, and one must do one's work nonetheless. But nothing succeeds like success: if Smolin or his friends can come up with a real unification, they'll be the toast of the town overnight, and the string theory hegemony will crumble on its own.<br /> <br />I also thought Smolin's remarks on the philosophy of science were a bit sketchy. He gives some wonderful personal anecdotes about Paul Feyerabend, but not much more than a brief summary of Feyerabend's philosophy of science. <br /> <br />Small objections aside, I learned a lot from this book. Smolin is always a good read, and he has a fabulous imagination that comes through even in many of his jokes (I especially enjoyed his \\"Sbozo the clown, or Bozo the Clownino\\" jab about supersymmetry).
0812974611|4.0|When you consider that this story is essentially about a newly appointed chief aqueduct engineer (Marcus Attilius Primus) investigating the pending failure of the famous Aqua Augusta you may be inclined to think this story could be cure for insomnia.<br /><br />But Robert Harris chooses a fascinating moment in time and place to add to atmosphere to his fine novel. The coast near Vesuvius AD79. From Misenum to Pompeii and its mostly wealthy Roman citizens charmed and comfortable lives are all about to be rudely shaken.<br /><br />Combining the marvels of Roman Engineering with the marvels of natures pending fury, Harris weaves a very interesting story. Marcus Primus's investigations into the disappearing water flow bring him into contact with a crooked ex slave, turned wealthy developer. When Marcus cottons onto the scheme which enabled this man to gain his wealth he believes he may also be close to solving the mystery of his predecessors unexplained disappearance. Both aided and hindered by the mans beautiful daughter Corelia the plot twists and thickens to create an atmospheric and beautifully researched historical mystery that hold the readers attention.<br />The authors writing is so absorbing you will even find the knowledge he shares through his main character Marcus's dedication and family passion for work on the aqueducts a true eye opener. Before reading this book I never really marvelled as to how the Romans designed and used aqueducts to bring water to the people long before pumping stations existed. Its strangely quite fascinating.<br /><br />My only complaint about the story and its enjoyable characters is the ending leaves one very big question unanswered. But I wont spoil it for you. Suffice to say you will be asking yourself the same question too after you have turned the last page.
B000GUJYRE|5.0|While it's true that Beethoven's symphonies are among the most recorded and played classical pieces, it is takes a great conductor and orchestra to bring out their brilliance. Many a time I have come away dissappointed after a live performance of one of my favorite symphonies of his. But not here. With these nine (and a few other well known pieces by Beethoven thrown in to fill out the discs) Bernard Haitink and the LSO establish themselves as brilliant interpreters of some of the greatest music ever composed. If you own Karajan's Beethoven's symphony or another great collection then there may be no need to own these too, but if you don't then this is an outstanding selection to own. The packaging is also quite creative although it's the music that counts.(The New Yorker also reviewed this work very favorably a month ago. A search on their website for LSO will bring it up.)

6305308659|2.0|Since sin is a narcotic best peddled to buyers already under its influence, Pleasantville might at first appear to us as an enlightened twist on the Eden myth - the twist being that the Fall is given dignity- where The Fruit of The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is exhalted to \\"The Fruit of Good.\\"<br /><br />What Pleasantville actually does is tell the story of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" but from the perspective of the snatched. The story is familiar in Sci-fi: unwelcomed beings show up on the scene spreading a mind-altering condition which, once surrendered to, infects its carrier with the idea that the infected state is much better. Carriers begin to engage in behavior which seems appalling to the uninfected. Carriers begin to proselytize vehemently. Despite terrified efforts at resistance, one-by-one the yokels succumb and become little proselytizing machines themselves. Those unwilling to convert are fearful for their safety and the safety of civilization. Recalcitrant citizens resort to violence and other measures to resist assimilation. But eventually everyone comes under the influence of the New Mind.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" however, Pleasantville is written from a narrative perspective that privileges the state of conversion and de-priveleges efforts at resistance. The writers achieve this switcheroo by deploying ethical and cinematic tropes in a way which invert moviegoers' traditional sympathies while keeping their default values intact. Instead of rooting for the brave souls who resist assimilation, this time around we are encouraged to endorse assimilation because this time we get to see how wonderful assimilation looks like \\"from the inside.\\" Instead of showing the assimilated state from the perspective of those not-yet-converted (to whom \\"colored\\" behavior seems dangerous, univocal, homogenized and zombie-like)  we are shown assimilation from inside the heads of the proselytizers themselves, for whom conversion has increased the qualia of consciousness and delivered a heightened sense of personal autonomy --  you know, more like us ticketholders. Efforts at resistance are cinematically paired with allusions to Naziism and sexism while successful assimilation is paired with a celebratory soundtrack and Technicolor.<br /><br />These inverted ethical tropes are what is fatal to Pleasantville. The film tries to tell a story of a \\"loss of innocence\\" but along the way is forced to characterize the \\"innocent\\" as racist Nazis who only become well-behaved after they eat the forbidden fruit. For while the writers try hard to get us to associate Pleasantville with the Eden myth (and to root for the corresponding \\"post-fallen\\" state), they can only do so at the expense of portraying racist behavior as a pre-fallen condition. Attentive audiences will be distracted from the story by this ham-fisted inversion.sion has increased the qualia of consciousness and delivered a heightened sense of personal autonomy --  you know, more like us ticketholders.

0618680004|4.0|British author, zoologist, biologist and humanist Richard Dawkins has more or less come to represent the movement towards secularism and emphasis on science and has also become the leading atheist figure of our time. In his latest book Dawkins drops the gloves and goes for broke by throwing in his entire arsenal of rational thought and logic to discredit and bury god, gods, religion and faith. Be it sheer deductive logic, comedy, foreboding, philosophy or pleading The God Delusion has either a dedicated chapter or a section with which to sway opinions.<br /><br />Now, Dawkins - being a scientist and methodical - puts himself in the \\"de facto atheist\\" category and shies away from an absolute statement early on in the book, but the rest of the 370 pages leave no doubt as to where the author stands and attack without hesitation.<br /><br />Comparing man and religion to a moth and flame, Dawkins takes advantage of a vast body of knowledge to scold, mock, exhort or offend as appropriate to nudge (more like heave really) the reader away from faith. Analogies like the aforementioned abound as the Oxford professor proclaims religiosity as akin to a misfiring of brain neurons, a ticking time-bomb or as serious an issue as Global Warming. Sarcasm is in ample supply as well, although the way Dawkins enumerates religion's follies the matter is presented as being far from a laughing matter and in fact quite deadly.<br /><br />Dawkins also takes time to assert his exasperation at the way religion and god need not justify themselves or prove themselves, while in sharp contrast all other concepts or opinions do. In fact, science has the onus of proof firmly attached to it, which Dawkins finds discriminatory. The book soon becomes an impassioned organ for reason in an age of superstition and a proud advocate for atheism and the abandonment of god and his fables. Why would god exist? Why would god be so cruel? Why would god allow such barbarism? Why do the holy books contradict each other and themselves? Why would god need our belief in him in the first place? Dawkins quotes a colleague who wonders why man needs religion to be good and what that fact says about religious people in the first place. It is fascinating and augmented by a well articulated logic against god's supposed omniscience and omnipotence, the reminder that faith encourages ignorance over proof and also overturns the age-old argument that it is better to wager on god's existence than on non-existence. Dawkins notes that betting has a down-side which might include wasting one's life or even betting on a wrong supreme entity and being punished for it later on.<br />Dawkins is adamant in reminding his readers that religion is in fact evil, has wrought tumult through the ages and that the concept is nothing more than a sham perpetrated by parent to child and religious institution to mankind in order to shape the world for various gains. Dawkin's own theory of memes, the discussion of TAP and PAP and historical perspectives and analyses further enrich The God Delusion.<br /><br />The book might not dent the well-armoured forces of religion and god, such is the nature of blind faith, but it surely pushes back as hard as any in recent years and might very well act as an impetus in the book's intended direction for those sitting on the fence. Certainly, any religious or god fearing person cannot read the book and not emerge at least out or enraged.<br /><br />The book promotes the idea that god, religion, faith and superstition deserve mankind's contempt as humanity's bane and should be aborted.hy would god need our belief in him in the first place?

B000JK8OYU|4.0|Well, the fans are really divided about this one. As a lifelong Beatles fan I have to say that I think it's worth $10 of anyone's money, but it will mean more to people who appreciate the Beatles significance in the history of popular music. What struck me most about this CD was the incredible improvement in sound quality over previous releases - for example, the bass lines are so clear but so are all the other instruments and voices. If nothing else it gets you thinking and wondering what the Beatles would have sounded like if they had had today's sound recording and reproduction technology all those years ago. They couldn't improve on the quality of the songs themselves - just the way they were recorded and reproduced. And that is what 'Love' does so well!
B0000CD5FN|5.0|One of the best showcases of Joe's cross-genre talent ever.  I love the smokey, sultry quality of his voice on these tracks.  Truly an enormous loss for all of us '70s teens who grew up in the original punk era was Joe's passing, and this, his last album prior to his untimely death in 2002 is, in my opinion, one of his best ever.  The incredible talent of the Mescaleros shines through, together with the energy Joe obviously brought to this Labor of Love.  Every single track on this CD is a good one, but I especially enjoy Get Down Moses.  Rock on Joe!  We miss you!
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I think 'Hey Jude' is one of the finest songs ever made by the Beatles. The Beatles are a nice rock band with talented singers like McCartney and Lennon who make decent music.

B00005JPAJ|5.0|I have read some professional reviewers who are put off by Babel's scene construction in its storytelling. They also feel that the characters don't connect emotionally. I don't know what film they saw, but please see Babel. It is one of those films that helps to break down the barriers which have us viewing people of different nations as \\"the other.\\"  <br />I don't believe that Brad Pitt has that elusive x factor to allow him to carry a movie like Tom Hanks and George Clooney possess; ie. star quality. It has nothing to do with degrees of talent. His forte is as a character actor and he more than proves it in this ensemble production. He is terrific in Babel. He should go the way of Kevin Bacon who knew this fact about himself and became a character actor. Bacon's move in this direction has resulted in his being a valuable part of many subsequent high profile quality films instead of eventually winding up in forgotten straight-to-video cheapies. I think Brad Pitt would be very successful with such a career move. Babel is a seminal film for our time in the need for us to see all peoples (not governments) as human beings with fears, troubles and who share the same general hopes and dreams.

Don't get me wrong - I am a huge Pumpkins fan (and have been for over 15 years), so I am not suggesting that the two bands are holistically comparable...but I do think that MCR have put together something special here.<br /><br />I do feel that one of the biggest obstacles for MCR will be overcoming the stigma that they had developed with their debut - many think of this band as an inauthentic pop-punk-emo here today/gone tomorrow group (and rightfully so, I wanted to rip my cable out of the wall the first time I heard the debut single, \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise).\\"<br /><br />I'm getting older now, so a lot of people I recommend this album to respond with, \\"Are you kidding me?  My Chemical Romance?\\"<br /><br />No.  I'm not kidding.  Check it out for yourself - go ahead and compare it to the other pop-punk records of recent history.  It makes them sound like child's play.  How good is it?  Siamese Dream good?  Go ahead and judge for yourself - just remember to keep your ears and heart open if you listen.  Writing a band off before listening to an album is a good way to miss out on some fantastic music.<br /><br />Suggested tracks:<br />  \\"How I Disappear\\" - The bridge of this song will rip you apart.<br />  \\"Sleep\\"<br /><br />Honestly, there are more good songs on this cd than most bands release during their entire career.<br /><br />Dang...sorry to gush about My Chemical Romance - I forgot - I'm not supposed to like these guys.

B0007TKNL0|3.0|After seeing various cast changes of this Andrew Lloyd Webber masterpiece on stage 4 times, I awaited this film's release with great anticipation. The funny thing about \\"Hollywood\\" they either improve upon the stage production, or like this disappointment leave much to be desired. Whatever happened to spectacular film makeup? This Phantom seems strangely hampered by very minor scarring. This is not the classic grotesque Phantom we know from prior films and stage! And with the geeky hairstyle given to Patrick Wilson, the actor portraying the romantic lead of Raoul, it seems almost a shame he was chosen by Christine over the much handsomer Gerard Butler.    Emmy Rossum makes for a very passable Christine, though her vocals were not quite as strong as some of the stage performers in the same role. A beautiful young presence with what should be a long career in films. The graveyard \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" scene is one of the most visually stunning; however, with so much of Ms. Rossum's cleavage exposed, during what was a rather wintry scene, the actress seemed noticeably unaffected. BRRRR. The same was true with her and Raouls roof top duet. And how could the Phantom lose in a duel of swords to Raoul? Kind of takes away from the mystique of his character. One of the more spectacular numbers, \\"Masquerade\\" was somewhat over choreographed, rather than the more free spirited stage productions. Each actor seemed \\"rehearsed and ready\\" for their big closeup. And the choice of black-and-white costumes for that scene left much to be desired over the colorful originals. Dull even. We could  also have done without the flashbacks of the Phantom's dreary childhood.    There were some strong supporting cast performances, namely Minnie Driver as Carlotta, though her singing was dubbed. Overall, an average film  adaptation of an extremely wonderful stage musical, though beautifully photographed. Unfortunately, not uncommon with Andrew Lloyd Webber creations when transfered to film. See the stage version if you haven't already had the opportunity. Much more entertaining.
B000J103YI|5.0|I was lucky enough to attend an advanced screening of the movie and it delivers on all counts.  The soundtrack is fantastic and Jennifer Hudson steals the show.  I and the rest of the audience burst into applause several times as if we were attending a live performance - see the movie and buy the soundtrack.  You will not be disappointed.
0743289412|5.0|One of my favorite things about Stephen King is that he's not a purely formulaic writer. Each book is a complete surprise, a new, and different kind of pleasure.  Lisey's Story is no exception.<br /><br />Lisey has lost her beloved husband, Scott, and now, two years after the fact, has decided to face the painful task of sorting through his personal papers.  This leads to a journey down memory lane for Lisey, and since we are along for the ride, we learn about Scott's horrifying childhood, the dynamics of their relationship, and the special healing place Scott went to in order to survive called \\"Boo'ya Moon.\\"<br /><br />There are other subplots; Lisey has to deal with a menacing Space Cowboy (King's eloquent and fitting term for rabid fan) named Dooley, and we become familiar with the tender, yet at times grueling relationship she has with her sisters.  Overall though, this really is \\"Lisey's (and Scott's) story,\\" one that takes place almost entirely in her head as she sorts through her memories, thoughts, and feelings for her husband.  In the end, with Scott's loving presence guiding her, Lisey is finally able to exorcise both of their demons and find peace.<br /><br />Poignant, and mesmerizing are both terms I would use to describe Lisey's Story.  What I found most impressive about it is Stephen King's ability to write it as if looking through Lisey's eyes; in depth into her thoughts, into her emotions; she truly seems like a real person.  It goes without saying that his rich prose and impressive vocabulary will never cease to amaze.  In my opinion, Lisey's Story is one of his best; truly a literary masterpiece.
B000005HLV|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could say that this record is \\"overrated.\\" Is it the greatest black metal record of all time? Surely not. However, to say that this record is overrated is a completely ignorant and unfounded statement considering its massive success and widespread influence. Allow me to get this out of the way first, nothing Mayhem has put out after this is relevant. It is not worth your time, but this record is definitely worth owning. This is the TRUE Mayhem with the original line up \\"almost\\" fully intact (Dead had, in fact, already blown his brains out before the recording of this record). What a pity. The only thing that stopped this band and tore it apart was death itself. You had Euronymous on guitar, Varg Vikernes on bass, Hellhammer on drums, and Attila Csihar on vocals. When all is said and done, this is a pretty grim and cold record. To me, this album serves as a perfect example of what black metal is about since it contains all of the nuances and trademarks of the genre. This album is made up of tremolo picked guitars and blast beats. It's pretty simple musically, yet effective in creating an atmosphere.     No keyboards or ambience, just a driving nihilistic rhythm that engulfs everything in obscurity and fog.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Whether you know Leonard Cohen's previous work or not, get this album. The lyrics are in a class of their own, and the music and subtle production holds up 4 years later. The words and music of this album will have a deep and mysterious impact on you, perhaps you will notice things around you you never noticed before, that's a lot to say in these times of disposable MTV hits.
0345028929|5.0|I reread this book over and over growing up. The language is unique, verging on poetry. The image of the last unicorn, who can be loved but not saved, stuck with me as a girl. She showed me how sometimes you have to act alone, in spite of consequences, for the best to happen.
B000B7BRMM|1.0|At first blink, Diana Krall's presentation of herself as the \\"yuletide floozy\\" seems to be an inappropriate choice for a Christmas cd. Then, it occurred to me that Jesus came to save us from our sins. Nonetheless, this image of Diana Krall at Christmas prevents me from adding this cd to my Christmas collection.
B000J103X4|4.0|This is a downright solid release from Game. His flow has definitely gotten more precise since the last release. Game rocks the beat nicely on \\"Strip Club.\\" The guest appearances are appropriate. Plus, he's been able to get personal, especially on \\"Ol' English.\\" Combination of a bump-in-yo-ride album mixed with some well-thought lyricism. One of the few albums of '06 so far actually worth the purchase.
B00000373U|5.0|Elliott Smith is kind of like Tom Petty, in that, he has songs that are not steller, but he does not have a single bad song.   <br /> <br />\\"Good Will Hunting,\\" directed by Gus Van Sant in 1997, was a better than average movie that would launch the careers of two major stars and re-establish Robin Williams as a great actor. The film would also bring attention to Elliot Smith; one of the greatest singer/songwriters in music history. <br />Smith's song \\"Miss Misery\\" appeared in \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and would garner an Academy Award Nomination for best original song. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately for the shocked and bashful Smith, \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" from \\"Titanic\\" took home the award that night. <br />Smith was born in the Midwest and raised in Texas, although it would be Portland, Oregon that Smith would call home for the majority of his life. After college Smith played guitar in the band Heatmiser. They would go on to release three full length albums together before Smith left the group to pursue his more successful solo career.    <br />\\"Either/Or,\\" Smith's third album as a solo artist is arguably one of the best records of the 1990's and the best example of Smith as a brilliant songwriter. The album is essential in any music library and is all too often overlooked by the casual music fan.   <br />Smith's first album \\"Roman Candle\\" and his self-titled second album consisted solely of Smith's signature \\"whispery\\" vocal style and his acoustic guitar.  \\"Roman Candle\\" is criticized by some for its poor production values, despite its solid songs. \\"Elliot Smith\\" is cited by some as the best album Smith ever released and is the best example of Smith and his acoustic guitar side by side.   <br />\\"Either/Or\\" would follow the same basic template of Smith accompanied solely by his acoustic guitar and angelic voice; however, Smith began to incorporate electric guitars, drums, bass, and even keyboards on some tracks `all played by Smith.'   <br />From the outset, \\"Either/Or\\" was different from any of Smith's previous records because it was the first time people were really starting to notice him. When asked by David Peisner in a 1998 interview about the pressure surrounding \\"Either/Or\\" smith replied; \\"I didn't have a hard time making it, I had a hard time letting it go.  I had a hard time deciding what songs to put on it.  I had a hard time after the fact but it was easy to record.\\" <br />Beginning with the stellar \\"Speed Trials\\" and following with \\"Alameda,\\" Smith sets the template for what is to follow throughout the album; an absolutely beautiful voice accompanied by an acoustic guitar, with the occasional drum beat thrown in the mix. <br />\\"Between the Bars,\\" one of three songs off of \\"Either/Or\\" that would be selected for \\"Good Will Hunting,\\" and is one of the most haunting and endearing songs Smith would ever record.  According the Adam Carson of AFI, \\"my favorite Elliot Smith track. Haunting, beautiful and intimate.\\" <br />\\"Pictures of Me,\\" is the most \\"done up\\" track on the album and contains lyrics suggesting that Smith is sick of the recent press that he had been receiving.   <br />\\"Rose Parade\\" contains one of the most memorable guitar intros in history and the song itself is one of Smith's strongest. <br />\\"Angeles\\" is another song that was chosen to be included in \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and is viewed by many as the strongest song on the album as well as perhaps the greatest song Smith ever sang. When describing \\"Angeles,\\" Jade Puget of AFI would say, \\"my favorite acoustic song of all time.  There are some songs you just wish you had written...\\" <br />\\"Say Yes,\\" the third song chosen for the movie, ends the album on a rather uncharacteristically positive note, but continues the stripped feel of the album. <br />In October of 2003 Smith would die from two self-inflicted knife stabs. Smith had a long standing heroin addiction, and he also suffered from severe depression. Despite his suicide, Smith has not been canonized asa deity in the way many other dead rock stars have been. <br />After \\"Either/Or,\\" Smith would release three more critically acclaimed albums, including the stellar follow up to \\"Either/Or,\\" \\"XO.\\"  <br />Smith has never gotten the commercial acclaim that dead artists such as Jeff Buckley went on to achieve, although Smith certainly does deserve it. People can argue over whether or not \\"Either/Or\\" is truly his masterpiece; it is however a truly great album by one of the truly great musicians of the last 25 years. <br />
B00005ARDC|5.0|I bought this album at Jared from Kings Of Leon's insistence, and I was not disappointed. In fact, I came to realize that KOL were no longer my favorite band, it is now BRMC. They are the most amazing collective to ever come out of well, anywhere. My best friend and I love them so much that we're now convinced their albums are \\"biblical\\" and listening to them is our form of church. Easily the only band that matters.
076531178X|5.0|Vin is the lowest of the low.  She is a Skaa thief in a race of slaves, however that is all about to change when her \\"luck\\" is recognised as a valuable skill she didn't even know that she possessed and she finds herself drawn into a world of high class thievery and rebellion that will affect the future of The Final Empire itself. <br /> <br />This has to be one of the best fantasy novels I have read in a long time.  It has good pacing, interesting characters and a plot some trilogies I've read in the past would be hard pushed to equal all in a single volume.  This novel has set a high standard for the rest of this trilogy and if the author can keep the books as good as this one this series is going to be a fantasy classic.  This book is recommended highly to anyone who loves a good fantasy read. <br />
0761119752|5.0|My 1-year-old got this for his birthday.  And we've read it every night since.  We bounce and dance with every page!!  It's my favorite book.  I like Sandra Boynton so much that I just bought him 2 more of her books for Christmas!!
0375703764|1.0|The dedication in this book reads \\"This is not for you\\".<br /><br />Boy, did they get that right.
B000JVT1U0|4.0|Fear not Wicker Fans! According to the Anchor Bay website, the 2-disk SE will contain both the American 88-minute version, with the 'extended' 99-minute version on disk two, along with a commentary and other goodies.     I LOVE this film and am looking forward to dumping my old VHS copy in favor of this shiny new version.     As others have said, it's a wonderful film. It's quite refreshing for once to see pagans NOT portrayed as a bunch of devil worshipers wearing black robes, casting evil spells and chanting around a fire (even though that does go on).
B0007GAEGC|5.0|As with most music you purchase today, there are only maybe 1 or 2 songs that are worth listening to.  Not on this CD, every song is beautiful. My favorite happens to be \\"the soft goodbye\\".  After losing my two beautiful husky's this year to cancer this song really hit home and helped me cope with the loss of my two boys. I recommend this beautiful,soothing music to all ages.
B000E33VWW|4.0|First off, the acting in this film is top-notch 110% Oscar material, no doubt about it.  Second, if you're expecting a bio-pic, forget it, this is a romanticized account of famed American icon Capote and how his life was \\"forever changed\\" by the events that influenced his infamous novel, \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  Great cinematography underlines the moody and stark themes contained within.  My only complaint:  the film tries to cover too much, too quickly, with mixed results.  For example, the empathy Capote feels for the killers occurs with such rapidity it doesn't allow the audience to catch up...then there's the ongoing distraction of Capote's infectious personality, which could in all fairness, be a film within itself.  When all is said and done, it is quite difficult to care for these killers, given the heinousness of their crimes, especially when Perry retells how he slit the throat of the father...and the tragedy and humanity of it are only superficially hinted at so that the bottom line is that it just leaves one feeling, well, a bit inpatient (as Capote was) for it all to end.  Still, this film tries very hard to give a screenplay treatment to a myriad of feelings that might be better handled in a novel.  Also, given Harper Lee's reknowned reclusiveness, a big plus of this film is getting to know her....if in fact the portrayal is accurate (we will never really know)....Thematically, she is the conscience of the film, which is sort of an overused Atticus Finch analogy.  Overall, this film is a better rental than an item to own, but it is definitely a must see.
0761119752|5.0|Boynton created a classic with 'Pajama Time!'.  The story takes place at the end of a long day, with various animals getting ready for bed.  All are hurrying to get their pajamas on for the great big Pajama-de-bop.  This is an uplifting tale celebrating the fun of going to bed.  A must read, and I have to say, one of Boynton's best works.
0143036556|4.0|Jared Diamond does a decent job of using anthropology to talk about history.  Well there are flaws in his theory on the history of some of these peoples the idea is one that bears some thinking. The idea that societies overpopulation can cause them to fail is an idea that has merit today.  Diamond goes all the way up through China and India to talk about their overpopulation and resource issues. In a Malthusian way he analyzes food and climate concerns related to the Mayan civilizations which are where his book gets the weakest.  The Mayan collapsed due to other factors than what he gives credit for (See Conquest, Borken Spears, ect).  This book still bears consideration though and is interesting to read about.
0195067142|5.0|This is one of the best first hand accounts of a little known battle in the Pacific. While almost everyone has heard of Okinawa which was a great success for the Marines despite heavy causalities the disaster at Peleliu was something different.  Peleliu was a vicious and protracted fight for the marines. The hard fighting that would take its toll and Sledge recounts it with stunning clarity.  It is hard to find good accounts of World War 2 and this is one of the best.  This book is an honest and clear account and is a must have for any World War 2 buff. This was part of a military history class that I took and if anyone is looking for a book that can show the horrors of World War 2 as well as the triumphs this is the book for you.
0671799320|5.0|This is among the best books on world history that has ever been written.  This covers the history of oil from Spindeltop to Saudi Arabia. It stops at the first gulf war although a second edition is in the work to bring it up to more present times.  Although a daunting length it truly is an amazing book that is well written.  Once you start reading you will not put it down until the end so set aside plenty of time to read.  This covers politics, geology, history, and economics in a wonderful blend that is smart and convincing.  It is very well researched and Mr. Yergin does an excellent job presenting his material.  Highly recommend and 10 starts is deserved for this monumental work.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I saw this movie before I saw the Firefly series.  I also saw it after watching the series.  It's good either way.  My wife, who typically is not a big sci-fi fan, also liked them both.
055358202X|5.0|Martin is hands down the best writing in fantasy today.  This book, though I admit is not QUITE as good as the first three, is still the best fantasy novel I've read in the past two years easy.  He has a knack for hitting you with great character twists and plot twists at the end of almost every single chapter, to the point where I often found myself looking up after each one and shaking my head in wonder, usually with a comment like, \\"You SOB.  How do you do it?\\"  And the funny thing is that most of the characters in this volume are the less interesting characters (if he HAS less interesting characters) and he still had me wanting more.  When I heard this volume only dealt with half the cast I was very skeptical and disappointed, but by 100 pages in I was hooked. <br /> <br />The man is GOOD.  A natural born storyteller who puts the rest of the fantasy authors to shame.
B000ION79Y|1.0|I agree with the other review. This is one of the worst Segal films of all time. HIS VOICE WAS DUBBED in parts of the movie!!!! In one scene you hear his voice and in another it is the voice that sounds like a totally different person. I was so astounded that I called a friend and played it for him over the phone. The content is a combination of a bad horror film and his recent film, Mercenary. I loved the old Segal in Out For Justice in which he used a cue ball wrapped in a bar towel to knock the teeth out of some convict in a bar! I have even come to like some of his new films, like Shadow Man. BUT this is the worst! There are fans out there like me that will rent any Segal film. BUT this was too much!
B000HT386M|4.0|Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) has a typical corporate middle management conflict: Work vs. Family. Forcing his wife to repriorotize a promised family outing at the \\"do it or lose your standing\\" threat of his boss, Newman goes out on the only errand for which he can think to leave the house: to look for an Universal Remote to simplify the \\"which one do I use for this?\\" issue he's been fumbling.<br /><br />The only store open is Bed, Bath and Beyond. Newman flops on a mattress to rest, from which he sees the Magical Blue Door below the sign, \\"BEYOND.\\" A strange man in a blue coat named Morty (Christopher Walken) takes him to a new Universal Remote model sitting atop empty shelves. This special model works on more than the TV; it works on the \\"screen\\" of life, as well. Morty gives Newman his phone number to call, and gives the remote for free.<br /><br />Newman begins realizing the remote's powers when his wife is intensely talking to him about serious family issues, and he says, \\"Freeze,\\" as he pauses the TV - and realizes that he has paused her, as well. He realizes he can avoid unpleasantries, and, as he is focused on getting ahead at work, he learns that he can fast-forward though such boring events as family dinners in order to get to his work. He sees fast-forwarding as a way to fulfill his other commitments without having to actually live through them.<br /><br />Newman uses Morty's phone number when he doesn't remember committing to something of which his wife reminds him. Morty shows Newman that, during fast-forwards, Newman is on something called Autopilot, meaning that he is physically present and able to respond at levels not involving his conscious participation. Morty shows Newman \\"the Menu,\\" from which Newman may navigate through his life. After perusing some scenes, Morty advises Newman that the remote has a special built-in feature that assesses his usage habits and begins performing his preferences, automatically.<br /><br />Newman already fast-forwarded activities in the marital bed once, and it appears that he is stuck with these activities in fast-forward mode for all of \\"Beyond.\\" He didn't get the promotion he wanted when he wanted it, so he fast-forwarded to when he did get the promotion, thinking it would only be a few months. It was over a year later, and he found that his children already didn't like to do some of the things they liked \\"only a few moments ago.\\"<br /><br />Morty tells Newman that Newman's preference has clearly been set to fast-forward between Work issues, and the remote has accommodated that preference. Newman pops into awareness to find himself promoted, obese, divorced, hospitalized, at his son's wedding, and hospitalized again. He learns that his father (Henry Winkler) has died, and when Newman faces Morty again, Morty takes him to the last time he saw his father. Newman was on autopilot. Now, Newman can see how destructive autopilot has been in his life.<br /><br />This was where I jumped my rating to four stars. Newman was a remote visitor to his own life, living on autopilot, not getting involved, not loving the people in front of him. He jumped from pinnacle to pinnacle, not involved in the process, not sharing himself...not understanding that life, at its finest, is living moment to moment, being completely aware of what is before him, loving who is in front of him, speaking his truth, not chasing, on the outside, after something that he already had on the inside. After divorcing Newman, his wife married someone who was present, and Newman's children thrived in that relationship.<br /><br />(Spoiler Alert now 'til the end)<br /><br />Newman got something the rest of us don't get in this one lifetime; a second chance to take back time and do it again. He awakens on the mattress to what may have been a dream (no blue \\"Beyond\\" door this time). He immediately goes home to reinstate the family outing. The remote shows up on his countertop with a note from Morty (\\"You'll know what to do this time\\").<br /><br />Newman puts the remote and note into the drawer and walks out to be a participant in his own life.awer and walks out to be a participant in his own life.
B000HT386M|5.0|I expected this to be a mindless, silly comedy to decompress after a long week.  It's not that.  I got something much deeper and more rewarding.  It's left a lasting impression.  Thanks for catching me off guard.<br /><br />While I found myself laughing throughout (who can't laugh with Adam Sandler?), the movie presents a powerful and inspiring message.  How often do we all \\"fast forward\\" in our lives, living on autopilot?  How often are we looking forward to the future to start living?  How often do we miss the present moment?<br /><br />I think this movie team did a brilliant job designing a movie that could entertain, and deliver a message about life -- straight to the jugular.  Seeing all the characters age and the architecture change was also impressive.<br /><br />Some of the other reviews commented on being frustrated with the movie.  I imagine that's partly because of the deep cord it strikes.  A painful reminder that our lives are much like Adam Sandler's character.  Fortunately, we can learn from Adam's adventures with this fancy remote control :-))  I hope this movie inspires thousands to consciously live their lives and honor their most important values now.<br /><br />I liked it so much, I bought it as gifts for several of my clients this year.  I'm a professional life coach and author.  I teach the importance of \\"living in the present moment\\" in my book \\"The Power of Inner Choice\\".  Click illustrates the EXACT consequences of living unconsciously.  A movie with a purposeful message is often more powerful than any seminar or book.

B000JJRIN4|4.0|I am disappointed to see the number of negative reviews of Gwen's new album. Love Angel Music Baby was a delicious piece of pop confection, to be sure, but it's nice to see that, for her sophmore effort, Gwen hasn't followed the same old path.     The Sweet Escape goes in a very different direction- a direction that shows the multi-faceted artist she can be. Make no mistake, the distinctive sound she established on her debut is definately here with the infectious \\"Now That You Got It\\", \\"Yummy\\", and of course, the lead-off single \\"Wind It Up\\" (I initially thought this was a terrible song, but it's worked itself into my brain!), but whereas her debut was all about retro and kitchy sounds, here the sound is modern. Electro beats and synths take up residence. Another big difference: Gwen shows a more mature and vunerable side. It's not all about the sassy platinum blonde who takes no prisioners. \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"4 In The Morning\\" are beautiful, slower tracks that prove she can do more that just hollaback. \\"U Started It\\" is a slow burner that also demands repeated listenings.     Love Angel Music Baby was a hard act to follow, but The Sweet Escape holds its own nicely. Rather than simply giving us a sequel, Gwen gives us a new chapter. Its an impressive mix all held together by her unmistakable voice. Other artists have taken notice and tried their own take , but nobody does it better than Gwen!
6304708521|3.0|I watched this film in an altered state of consciousness with my friends S. and T., and we throughly enjoyed it. The next day, my friend S. shows the scene preceding \\"Fool on the Hill\\" to E. to demonstrate its genius, only to realize how terrible this film is. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I still have good memories of the movie, especially the bit featuring George Harrison.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|If you like the muppets, you will at least like this movie.  I happen to love it.  HOWEVER this cannot get five stars since in Lucas-ian fashion, this version includes revisions not in the original.  I don't mind remastered images or sound, but changing content drives me nuts.  I won't give my opinion of the song that is omitted from this version, since that is not my point.  After seeing what has happened to 'Star Wars', I cringe anytime a director or studio starts monkeying around with an old favorite.  Like they don't realize their movies have generated a loyal fan base who deserve some loyalty in return for giving them $$ year after year.  I'd like to vote with my $$ yet again and not buy this DVD.  Unfortunately, the old VHS player has played its last movie, and I have to get a DVD version or spend my first Christmas in ages not watching this movie.  Tough choice.
0618680004|2.0|Zoologist Richard Dawkins made his name originally for his lucid popular science writing in the fields of biological and cultural evolution - his wonderful works The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype are still compulsory reading in this fascinating field - and more latterly for increasingly intolerant, grumpy tracts inveigling against religion. The God Delusion is the latest - and grumpiest - in the second category.<br /><br />It's hardly surprising that Dawkins - an evolutionary biologist, after all - should object to religious accounts of the creation of the universe. But that he should do so as trenchantly and repeatedly as he does makes you wonder: Is it just because this stuff sells, or doth the lady protest too much? Is Richard Dawkins perhaps trying to convince himself as much as anyone else?<br /><br />Science, he says, \\"flings open the narrow window through which we are accustomed to viewing the spectrum of possibilities\\". It is, to quote the late Carl Sagan, \\"a candle in the dark\\". It's the path to the truth. Without science, the universe has no meaning.<br /><br />Of course, these are all things which a religious person (which I'm not, by the way) might say about God.<br /><br />Dawkins says God is nonsense (there are shades of that famous exchange in graffiti: \\"`God is Dead' - Nietzsche. `Nietzsche is Dead' - God\\"), but in wishing to annex the epistemological high ground, Dawkins has engaged a piddling match which he simply can't win. The scientific method, being inductive, can no more reveal the truth about the universe than a holy scripture can. That's a formal logical proposition, by the way, and not some woolly post-modern nonsense. Brilliant philosophers and scientists, from the Descartes at the dawn of the Enlightenment to Hume at the end of it right down to post-war 20th Century writers like Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn, have all grappled with exactly that problem: How *do* we categorise science; an endeavour which seems to move unerringly toward the truth without ever having the tools to achieve it?<br /><br />For all that, Dawkins is persuasive that we shouldn't forgo our own considered judgment for that of wise men in funny clothes who claim to be learned in obscure scriptures - then again, this is hardly news to anyone with a tertiary education. But in claiming science as the *true* candle in the dark, Dawkins sets his scientific brethren up to be no better: wise men, only dressed in lab coats and not habits, learned in obscure \\"scriptures\\", to whom we should defer our own judgment (if you think I'm overstating this consider: do *you* understand quantum theory, or even know what it is? Fluid dynamics? Aerodynamics? If not, and you still ride on aeroplanes, then on what basis, other than faith?).<br /><br />This observation, which owes something to the historian Thomas Kuhn, infuriates Richard Dawkins, but I don't see any way around it. Kuhn argued, persuasively that the development of science and the particular currency of given theory is far more contingent on ostensibly irrelevant social and environmental circumstances than scientists care to acknowledge: a scientific paradigm provides not only answers to conundrums, but the questions, too, so its objective validity is impossible to measure from within the paradigm (or for that matter, from without).<br /><br />The irony is that Richard Dawkins (who has avowedly rejected Kuhn's work elsewhere) drifts ever closer to it in the latter pages of The God Delusion - even citing favourably Ludwig Wittgenstein - without ever acknowledging the logical trap he's falling into.<br /><br />That it's been a runaway best seller is indisputable; exactly why is harder to fathom: it's not as if it's bringing anything new to the table: Dawkins rehashes exactly the same old Philosophy 101 arguments that we all remember from those golden years at university, when there was time to argue the metaphysical toss, and self-righteously baiting self-righteous Christians passed for some kind of sport.<br /><br />It's a sport that Richard Dawkins appears not to have grown out of. Nor has passing time or increasing maturity tempered his tone. But wailing dogmatically about the perils of dogma isn't going to persuade anyone who isn't already part of the congregation.<br /><br />Nor is it even the most considered entry on the topic in the last year: Dan Dennett's \\"Breaking The Spell\\", published not six months previously, is a more erudite, thoughtful, intellectually stimulating and tolerant take on pretty much the same subject.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonus Christians passed for some kind of sport.  <br /> <br />It's a sport that Richard Dawkins appears not to have grown out of.

0316548189|5.0|The sheer bulk and length of Nelson Mandela's magnum opus seemed daunting, and I left it on the shelf for a long time. But once I started, the author's enthusiam and optimism -- in the face of some of the most virulent and entrenched racism and oppression faced by human beings -- made it a delight to read.<br /><br />Mandela takes us from his childgood in the Transkei region of South Africa, through his school years, his coming of age as a lawyer and politician, through his treason trials and imprisonment on Robben Island and final vindicatory release. Along the way, he provides fascinating and often funny vignettes of his perceptions, his maturation and even his mistakes. Mandela is not out to write hagiography here, but subtly and honestly describes his struggles and failures as a man, and those of the ANC (African National Congress), with which he was associated for many years. He even writes about his own struggles (personal and pragmatic) with treating people differently based on skin pigmentation. Mandela's deep desire to maintin his dignity in the face of apartheid's ludicrous tyranny are memorable and uplifting. Those who see him as a terrorist need only ponder his decades of working within the system, attempting to follow the non-violent lead of Mohandas Ghanhi -- only to be subject to repeated attempts by the government -- via bannings, silencings and forced relocations -- to disempower him and his people. Reading the book will make the reader appreciate that using violence was a measure of last resort against a conscienceless foe.<br /><br />\\"Long Walk to Freedom\\" is a must-read to those who wish to know Nelson Mandela better, who love South Africa or who simply cherish freedom and the dignity of all human beings.
B000AY3KN0|1.0|Am I supposed to believe that this big honking gorilla wants to have sex with something that could easily fit up his rectum? OK, so maybe he's more than a one-night stand, but still, is he out of his pea-brain? I mean, you ever see a mouse run by in the kitchen and go grabbing after it because you wanted to rescue it from its loveless plight? Do you not think I know that I've just asked three questions in a row? Far more interesting, but never addressed by the director, is how King Kong got to be so big. Did this island belong to Dr. Moreau or was it Jurassic Park? Was he buddies with Godzilla? Did he give pointers to the Hulk? Could he dance with a Sentinel? And what, exactly is the joke I missed that has Kong wearing such a sh**-kicking grin in all of his scenes?
B000003C2U|5.0|When Human was released back in 1991 it challenged all misconceptions and stereotypes people had about what death metal was supposed to sound like. This album proved that death metal could be technical, innovative, and most of all, intelligent. Don't let the muddy production deter you from this album. On Human, main axe-man Chuck Schuldiner, rhythm and lead guitarist Paul Masvidal, bassist Steve DiGiorgio, and drummer Sean Reinhart unleash a fury of death metal riffage, double-bass work, and masterful guitar solos. They unleash this to devastating effect on the listener. I won't go into a track-by-track review but I will describe the opening track Flattening of Emotions, which is among my favorite Death songs. It slowly fades in with some quick double-bass work and drumming by the terrific Sean Reinhart, then Chuck and Paul play some very ominous sounding riffs, and finally a torrent of pummeling tremolo-picked riffs assault the listener. At 1 min and 22 seconds there is one of the coolest and heaviest riffs I've ever heard. Two very sweet solos by Chuck and Paul make this track an absolute gem. The great part about this album and all Death albums in general is that Chuck wrote all the music himself, which is a testament to his great musical talent. Another great part is that the awesome Steve DiGiorgio is the bassist so it automatically scores in the points department with me. Fortunately, his talents would be better utilized on Individual Thought Patterns, the subsequent Death album.     What are you waiting for? Buy this CD and automatically become cooler than you ever were before. Buy it now! R.I.P. Chuck Schuldiner
B000G759LW|5.0|First off, I am a 46-white Southern male who is as nerdy as a doorknob. I am in the least demographical market that would be an Aguilera fan.    That said, I bought this album based on the song \\"Hurt' and reviews on Amazon that likened her work to Fiona Apple and other bluesy, jazzy singers. I wasn't disappointed. Christina's vocals are unbelievable. Her control is more fine than the pre-druggy Whitney Houston. She also has firmly planted herself in first place among the other kid singers, i.e. Britney and that ilk.     Christina is still a kid, but she has shown a maturity on this album, I think. I love the look of the album is that of an old RCA record and there's even the vinyl groove scratches on some of the songs. I've played the second disc more since I bought Back to Basics and I've been pleased. The opening song, Enter the Circus, is beautiful. Candyman is fun (even as an old stodgy, I smile at her \\"Panty dropping\\" line. Of course, Hurt is the highlight. It showcases her talent with a minimal amount of music. She carries the tune by herself.    I am somewhat surprised that I like this album so much. But she conveys an earlier era of music and it's fun. Sounds like something from the 1930s Harlem clubs. This album really propels Christina Aguilera into the higher echelon of all singers.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|This may be the most stunning recording ever released by The Beatles, and make no mistake, through the grace of Paul, Ringo, Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison, this IS a Beatles' project. When we first heard these songs originally during the 60's, we were astounded by the 'genius of the whole' - the brilliance of a band at the peak of creative power - the Beethovens of their time. But now, forty-some years later, through the spirit of George Martin (the man who rightfully should be considered the 'Fifth Beatle'), we are given the opportunity to attend that Reunion about which we all dreamed. For this release is exactly what we might have expected if the Fab Four could have found a place where they each were comfortable being in the same space to revisit their monumental accomplishments. George Martin's palpable joy in making this recording, and the wonder of Giles Martin in getting to work with this material becomes evident immediately. They imbue the music they present here with the spirit we could expect from the Boys if they did a segment of \\"Unplugged\\" (only we all know they wouldn't have settled for just being 'unplugged'). In these reworked songs, so brilliantly differentiated from the originals, you now get a feel for the genius of each part which was blended into the overwhelming collective whole as first released. The components are visible here as never before, and what you will realize as you listen is that the Martins have done nothing more than show us an incredible collection of Beatles-created SOUNDS so brilliant as to make one cry for the loss of such genius forty years later. Those who philosophically object to such a revisiting of 'sacred works' miss the imperative here - these SOUNDS have a spirit all their own - they live and breathe as if performed anew on a rooftop in London merely because the Boys feel like doing them again. And that is the magic here - that finally we are privy to a gettogether where the Boys had fun with their legacy.
0786868694|5.0|If you're a fan of Nigella's show, either the British version, or the American import, you will love this cookbook. A lot of the recipes come directly from the tv episodes. The cookbook is lined with great chapter intros that share a bit more about what makes Nigella tick. <br /> <br />I think I speak for all Nigella fans when I say we are 50% drawn to her recipes, and 50% drawn to Nigella herself, the way she cooks effortlessly, without worry or want, or her perspectives in life, which remind us to cherish time with friends and family, and not to sweat it in the kitchen. <br /> <br />I've purchased a number of Nigella cookbooks, and this one has the most post-it sticky notes coming out of it! <br /> <br />I know you'll enjoy this cookbook as much as me!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|It's a collection of a lot of more literary works like her \\"Highwayman.\\" <br /> <br />Probably my favorite is Sir Walter Scott's \\"The Ladye and the Knight,\\" but the rest is all good, solid work.   <br /> <br />It's nothing different, per se.  You can put this CD on back to back with \\"Book of Secrets\\" and the ambience is still the same, but I don't think that's such a bad thing.  The musicianship is as solid and exacting as the music that made her famous. She's a 'world' musician with a true feel of how the music of the world actually plays--that authenticity combined with her voice and arrangements is what makes her so compelling.   <br /> <br />I'd cheerfully buy more McKennitt CDs like this--just don't want to have to wait 10 more years to get them!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|You won't be able to take this CD out of the player once you crank it up and settle in for the night. Add some holiday candles, a fireplace, and some good friends, and you will be set. This is much more than just a Christmas album, it's some of Sarah's best work, including the tracks Wintersong and River. <br /> <br />Wintersong is the only original song on the album, and it showcases Sarah's amazing emotional range. Lyrically, the song is melancholy and longing, her voice is as outworldly as ever. <br /> <br />River, a cover from Joni Mitchell, does justice to the original version. She glides effortlessly to one of her favorite artists, and the song seems to get repeated on my ipod over and over again. <br /> <br />This is a fantastic holiday album. Although you may not find some of the sad, longing type songs that Sarah is known for, it is a perfect holiday gift for anyone!
B00005JPGM|5.0|You should know that, first and foremost, Blood Diamond is an action/adventure movie, complete with astounding escapes, chases, implausible coincidence, violence, and the like.  It is also very well done on that level, with Edward Zwick ably handling the pure adrenaline rush of the action.    But Zwick's film is also set in the context of the tragedy of conflict diamonds amidst civil war, and the horror seemingly endlessly perpetrated upon poor civilian populations by \\"men with guns\\", or in this instance, often \\"children with guns\\".    What can one say about the misery of so much of Africa?  So much of the world, really.  When confronted by the seeming contradictions of life in war torn Sierra Leone, discos and rap music and hand amputations and 10 year olds with AK-47's, one character's answer is \\"TIA\\" i.e. \\"This is Africa\\".      The diamond trade is not happy with this film, and I can see why.  The fact that the  monopoly controls the market so effectively to keep the price up, and the fact that such an easily tranportable wealth means keeping \\"conflict diamonds\\", the blood diamonds of the title, from supplying the arms for more violence over their control near impossible. When the journalist, played by Jennifer Connelly, says \\"if people knew the cost of a diamond is an arm, they wouldn't buy them\\" I wondered if that were so.    I think the sorrow of the film is heightened by the natural beauty of the place, filmed wonderfully.  The cast is fine.  Leonardo DeCaprio is very good here.  Djimon Housou brings an inherent dignity to his role, one that seems to be present in all his work.  Jennifer Connelly always embodies intelligence along with her beauty (and I don't know how she manages to get even better looking as time goes on, but she does).    A very fast and furious action film with a lot of other things on its mind, I found the film well worthwhile.
B00005JPDJ|5.0|This film is about love.  It's funny but it more a portrate of the different mindsets of those in love.  But it covers all aspects of love, the love of friends (non-sexual), the love between generations (totally non-sexual), and of course the \\"Cameron Diaz\\" definitely sexual kind of love.  This is a refreshing and fun look at life and love.  Great chick-flick to boot.  Find a chick take her to the film it will be worth it in two ways.

B000BTEQJQ|3.0|A very stirring performance of La Traviata, highlighted by a great cast, Sutherland, Pavarotti, Milnes and Von Stade, all in their primes and in great voice. By 1970 Sutherland's interpretation of Violetta had grown tremendously from her first studio recording. Pavarotti and Milnes sing Alfredo and Germont beautifully. This CD sounds like a pirated recording and at times everything sounds like it is coming from the bottom of a barrel, with the audience's noices being front and center at times. Also, the recording level  balance favors Pavarotti in his duets with Sutherland; his voice is crystal clear and I assume do to the immense size of her soprano, her voice is awash in distortion. If you can find it cheap, it may be worth it to either Sutherland or Pavarotti fans.
B000ION79Y|1.0|I'm in total agreement with other reviews read regarding this movie! I think Steven Segal has seen his days and should have given up movie making a long time ago. His last few releases were pretty bad, but this one was the worst I've seen! He was never much of an actor to begin with, but as an action movie fan, I had purchased all of his movies. This one will be my last!    Recent releases shows that he is doing less and less 'acting' (if you even want to call it acting), looking like he has gained 50 pounds, trying to cover it up with his long trench coats, unable to do 'any' of his own stunts anymore. What is even worse is that it is so obvious! You would think that with today's special effects, cameras, and other means, they could make a movie where this isn't so obvious.     Steven Segal had already proven that he can beat up on women, for those that didn't hear about his domestic battery charge from the past, but it would seem that he can't even beat up on the 'bad guys' anymore! Thanks goodness for stunt doubles!    I would tend to guess that the biggest part of the budget for this movie, (besides his salary), was for stunt doubles that has to do all his work for him these days. I guess he figures that just his name is going to carry him into more movie making... not after this movie!    His status as an 'actor' is such that his movies aren't even hitting the theaters. They go straight from poor editing and the cutting room floor to DVD.     And this movie should have stayed on the cutting room floor! Not only did the plot of the movie suck, but it was hard to follow, and I would say that a third to half of the movie had that dubbed voice issue that other reviewers commented on. And it wasn't even close! I guess there wasn't enough room in the budget to hire a good impersonator...     I also agree with the comment being the entire movie being shot in such a dark setting. Where they trying to save money on lighting, or covering up for Steven Segal's weight gain, and the use of a lot of stunt doubles?    Then there is Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, the distributor of this DVD, that I had talked to personally. Who at Sony decided to even accept the distribution of this so-called movie? Who ever it was, should be fired!    They commented that they received countless complaints about this movie already. That the dubbed voice of Steven Segal was in no way any part of Sony's involvement in this movie. That it was the decision of the producers and director of the movie to release it as it is, a poor quality, badly made movie that was only going to sell because it had a picture of Steven Segal on the cover.     I got the impression that Sony will eventually drop distribution of this title like a hot potato, so check out the $5.99 bins at Wal-mart if you really want this title, as it probably won't be in print very long! Personally, if I had seen it before I spent $20.00 for it, I wouldn't have even bought it at $5.99.    It's no wonder that all his new releases are never discounted like other new releases that hit the store shelves on Tuesdays. He has no market potential any more.    To Steven Segal, GIVE IT UP! You're a 'has been' that can't realize that your time is past. Oh... and by the way, why don't you take some of that money you milked off those people that bought this 'dog', and get a haircut! That rat's nest hanging down the back of your neck 'really' looks stupid, and needs to get chopped off! And save up some of that money for a larger trench coat... it looks like you'll be needing it. The one you have been wearing isn't covering it all up anymore!    I think the biggest problem with Steven Segal is that he has been playing such roles for so long, I actually think he believes he some sort of indestructible, militaristic, C.I.A., super spook!
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Fantastic movie!  We always give Denzel movies the benefit of the doubt, because he usually delivers on the promise of fabulous acting and a relavent plot.  This movie looked interesting, and it was - the whole time.  I thought the acting was spot-on by Denzel and by Clive Owen, and I love the way the narrative was presented at the beginning and the end.  This really keeps you guessing.  It was worth the money at the movie theater to see it on the big screen, and it was worth the money when I bought the DVD.
1400097029|5.0|John Banville's award winning \\"The Sea\\" is an evocative look at one's past and its presence in the present and future. The novel is written in skilful prose that uses a lot of adjectives to set the mood and the nostalgic tone of the narrative. The writer also relies on plastic arts as a reference to bring to this story pictorial image that sometimes looks like a foggy dream.<br /><br />Throughout the narrative Banville makes his main character Max Morden a believable person that is trapped in a past that he can't quit. His most recurrent memory is one summer when he met the Grace family, and how he was fascinated by them -- mostly by the two teenage-twins, Myles and Chloe. As he became more and more close to this people, his own life seemed to be drown in a spiral of love and desire. Years later, he comes back to that idyllic village, what brings back many memories.<br /><br />Banville trusts in his prose to bring his reader Max's feelings and emotions -- therefore, much is said, and mostly in a poetic tone. What for some can be a blessing, for others can be dreadful. It only depends on how much the reader is interested in learning about how colorful things happened instead of how and why they happened.<br /><br />To create a powerful image, the writer is always evocating famous painters and their work -- mostly Bonnard. The result is usually magic since the reader has a source from where have the idea of the picture Banville is trying to create. On the other hand, sometimes the prose reads very artificial and purposely labored.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Sea\\" has a positive result -- it is a beautiful book with a powerful story (that gets better near the end) --, but at the same time one has the feeling that English lingo writers have produced better books in 2005 -- Ian McEwan's \\"Saturday\\", and Zadie Smith's \\"On Beauty\\", to name a few -- that deserved to take the Man Booker Prize. It seems that judges preferred the supposedly beautiful form, that never connects to the real world, to powerful novels that brought up current social-political issues.r connects to the real world, to powerful novels that brought up current social-political issues.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Okay, Disharmonic Nightmare this album didnt make YOU any smarter, thats obvious.  But for people that like to listen to actual art that comes from the heart, you will want to get this CD.  Its not the same as Aenima or Lateralus, BUT it is nevertheless an outstanding album (why would you want more of the same anyway?).  Listen to it like you dont have anything to compare it to.  Take it for what it's worth, on it's own, and you will find out that it comes from a very deep and talented source.  It makes me feel good just like ALL their other albums.  Maybe we need better listening skills?

0553582445|5.0|In the Tawny Man trilogy, Robin Hobb takes you back to the Six Dutchies 15 years after the Red Ship Wars of the Farseer trilogy.  All of your favorite characters return: Fitz (as Tom Badgerlock), the Fool (as Lord Golden), Nighteyes, and Chade.  While the story gets off to a slow start (with the first half being dedicated to introducing the new, older Fitz), it gets going eventually and doesn't let up.  This trilogy is sure to be right up there with the previous two (meaning absolutely wonderful).<br /><br />Fool's Errand takes place just after the Liveship Traders trilogy, and events and places from both previous series are referred to.  For example, Fitz unexpectedly visits the mysterious Treasure Beach on the Other's island in this book, which I'm sure will have a major impact on the story (even though it remains a mystery as to how).  Hobb seems to be working towards some kind of meshing of all three trilogies, and I'm sure it will be pretty spectacular.<br /><br />The whole book is told in the first person from the perspective of Fitz.  This works extremely well for these books with their unique type of mind-sharing magic, and allows Hobb to maintain a lot of mystery about the plot and about some of the characters (such as the Fool).  Because the reader only knows as much as Fitz does, you feel like you're only getting part of the story at some points, but that only adds to the enchantment of the book.  Most of the characters in the book seem to hold secrets that both you and Fitz are dying to know.  This really makes for an entralling read.<br /><br />Robin Hobb has become one of my all time favorite authors, and I have very high expectations of her work.  Nevertheless, she has yet to disappoint.  Actually, she seems to be getting better and better.  I have not come across another writer that is able to evoke such strong emotions.  The characters and their relationships and feelings are so powerfully realistic and moving that you'll find your spirits sinking and soaring in time with theirs.<br /><br />Go read all of Hobb's books, starting with the Farseer Trilogy.inking and soaring in time with theirs. <br /> <br />Go read all of Hobb's books, starting with the Farseer Trilogy.

Acting is top-notch, storyline is complex and fun to follow, and the action and special effects are superb. An excellent cast, twisting plot and even costumes will interest you until the very end. Well worth the watch.

0486448843|4.0|I was thrilled to find this art card book in the gift shop of the National Gallery here in Washington, DC.  John William Waterhouse (1849-1917) is my favorite artist; I own several big prints of his paintings, and the small, frame-able art cards in THE WOMEN OF WATERHOUSE are a valuable addition to my collection.  Represented here are some of the most iconic paintings of the Victorian and Edwardian eras:  OPHELIA, MIRANDA, LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI, THE LADY OF SHALOTT, THE SOUL OF THE ROSE, SAINT CECILIA.  But ultimately, what makes the book worth far more than the few dollars I paid for it are the relatively rare pictures, those that are hard if not impossible to find in print form; these include the early masterpiece ST. EULALIA and the later THE ANNUNCIATION, as well as WINDFLOWERS, A TALE FROM THE DECAMERON, a different OPHELIA, and the un-bowdlerized version of THE CRYSTAL BALL.  The look of the rare cards is superb, too, the colors true and vivid.  In fact, only SAINT CECILIA and the first LADY OF SHALOTT have problems in this regard, the one being too dark and the other too light in color.  Those titles are much better reproduced in the boxed collection J.W. WATERHOUSE:  MYTH AND ROMANCE, also sold by Amazon.com.  So if you are a Waterhouse admirer and buy both THE WOMEN OF WATERHOUSE and MYTH AND ROMANCE, you should end up fully satisfied.

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins has attracted a lot of attention with The God Delusion, and for good reason.  He pulls no punches with a robust defence of atheism and reason as opposed to using faith as a means of making important life decisions.  The tone of the book is shamelessly opinionated, and he leaves you in no doubt as to where he stands.  His aim is to encourage more people to 'come out' as atheists, and to 'raise the consciousness' of those who tolerate the widely-held assumption that blind faith in a higher existence is a virtue.  Atheists remain one of the last social groups who are openly vilified and discriminated against on account of what they think, and Dawkins wants that to change. <br /> <br />The damage that has been done to the world by faith-based reasoning and organised religion is covered in a fair amount of detail with plenty of anecdotal stories thrown in to give the reader something to latch onto on an emotional level.  The supression of scientific development, the teaching of ignorance at the expense of scientific fact, the subjugation of women, the abuse and brainwashing of children, the fallacy that only faith has a moral code, and of course the jihads and religious wars are all covered. <br /> <br />The philosophical arguments in favour of the God Hypothesis, as he calls it, are presented and knocked down one by one in incisive detail, and many are exposed as circular reasoning.  The foundations of religion, the ancient scriptures, are examined closely, and the cruelty and violence of the old testament God is explained in shocking clarity.  God is portrayed as an insecure, vengeful, jealous, genocidal maniac.  Interestingly, there are examples of scripture that look suspiciously like they were duplicated during centuries of editing.  For example, Lot's departure from Sodom (after he showed God how righteous he was by offering his daughters up to a mob to be raped in order to protect some angels who came to visit, Genesis 19:7-8) is suspiciously similar to another story in Judges 19:23-4.  The mysoginist tone of the monotheistic holy books is made very clear throughout all of this, indicating how it was all written by men in a time when women were considered almost sub-human, and there are people in the world today who still want to adhere to such inhumane principles both in Christendom as well as the Islamic world.   <br /> <br />There is an interesting exploration of the Catholic church's talent for making things up as it goes along using its own self interest as a motive and warped reasoning as the justification.  Purgotory was invented as a means of justifying prayer (also exposed as ineffective elsewhere in the book) for the dead and as a means of generating revenue in the form of 'indulgences,' something the author describes as 'the medeival equivalent of the Nigerian internet scam.' <br /> <br />At all times, Dawkins keeps yanking the reader back to the reality of how the world works as explained by science.  Natural selection is described not as an unlikely 'chance mutation' but as a gradual process in which the development of complex organisms is actually inevitable in many places in the universe wherever the conditions are suitable.  Intelligent design advocates look for holes in scientific knowledge that can only be plugged by a god, only to retract whenever science plugs the gap with new discoveries. <br /> <br />Some people deride atheism as an 'empty existence' and having 'no meaning.'  Dawkins extolls the virtues of atheism coupled with a deep understanding of the wonders of science.  The universe as known to science is much bigger and much more impressive than the relatively small and young concoction of the ancient peoples who needed simple stories for simple people to explain that which they did not yet have the scientific knowledge to understand. <br /> <br />If you are an atheist and have been shy about voicing your beliefs (or lack thereof) in the presence of religious people, reading this book will give you new confidence and pride in your preference for reason over faith.
B000I0QK74|5.0|What more could you ask for? It's a James Taylor Christmas album. What more could you want? I LOVE THIS CD!!! Unlike other Christmas albums, I could actually listen to this all day long. It's simply gorgeous from beginning to end. Just buy it. You know you want to. :)
B000I0QK74|5.0|What a fabulous new Christmas CD!!  Nice, jazzy, upbeat takes on well known songs.  A great piece to play at a Christmas party! I cannot wait to play it at ours.....a fun one to listen to while wrapping presents and sipping cheer around the fire.  Pick it up today!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Im a huge beatles fan, and very rarely do i like their music re-done. However i was very delighted with this cd, some of the songs sound exactly as the originals with dubbing and pasting over them. For example a day in the life (they left off the outro, WTF?). There was only one song that i found offensive and truly feel it should have been left out, Gnik Nis, which is Sun King backwards, whats up with that? One of the most beautiful songs on abbey road butchered. but this cd is worth getting for some other songs.<br /><br />Strawberry fields....... I love the remix on this song<br /><br />Eleanor Rigby/Julia........ Mostly E.R., A few seconds of julia at the end of the song, sounds fantastic.... wish they would have done more<br /><br />Another great job with Lucy in the Sky with diamonds<br /><br />and of course While my guitar gently weeps<br /><br />Overall I think this cd has some most have songs for big beatles fans such as myself.... nothing new..... only a diff, way of listening
0618680004|4.0|\\"The God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins is an important book and a welcome addition to the expanding body of literature that demystifies religion.  Dawkins turns the principal argument of supporters of \\"intelligent design\\" on its head by demonstrating that the existence of \\"God\\" is infinitely more improbable than the evolution of humans and other complex creatures by natural selection.  He attributes the universality of religious belief to a by-product of the genetically encoded survival value of a child's unquestioning acceptance of the instructions it receives from its parents and the other authority figures in its life.  Readers with a background in the biological sciences will find the author's reasoning to be both clear and convincing.  The rest may benefit from reading one or more of his previous books, in particular his classic \\"The Selfish Gene.\\"    Other reviewers have described the many merits of this book in considerable detail, so I will confine my comments to what I perceive to be its principal shortcoming: the narrow perspective from which the subject of religion is approached by the author.  Dawkins has chosen to limit his critique of religion to the application of the scientific method and the knowledge that it has produced, especially in the area of evolutionary biology.  He ignores the many important contributions that have been made from other perspectives.  For example, I was surprised to find no reference whatsoever to the works of some of history's most influential debunkers of religion, such as Marx (\\"A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right\\"), Nietzsche (\\"The Genealogy of Morals\\"), and Freud (\\"The Future of an Illusion\\").  Dawkins dismisses other approaches to the critique of religion with the statement that \\"The question of whether religions are deliberately designed by cynical priests or rulers is an interesting one, to which historians should attend.  But it is not, in itself, a Darwinian question\\" (p. 169).  Surely suchsocial and psychological phenomena as narcissism, gullibility, and con-artistry are as relevant to an analysis of religion as are genetics and natural selection.  Of course an author has the right to limit the scope of a book as he or she sees fit.  But Dawkins' argument would be more persuasive to the general reader if it were bolstered by references, at least in passing, to complementary ideas from other perspectives.    The omission of references to alternative critiques of religion appears to be motivated by more than just the need to conserve paper stock and maintain authorial focus.  The book contains a number of snide remarks about methods of critical analysis derived from the arts, humanities, and social sciences that give the impression that Dawkins has little use for any ideas that are not products of the scientific method.  He reserves his greatest disdain for structuralism, post-structuralism, and postmodernism, which he ridicules as \\"haute francophonyism\\" (p. 347).  His attitude seems to confirm that the intellectual rift described by C.P. Snow in \\"The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution\\" has not been bridged one iota in the intervening half-century.  It is generally accepted that the scientific method is a useful tool for the critical analysis of nature.  Many would argue that postmodern \\"deconstruction\\" is an equally useful tool for the critical analysis of culture.  Because culture is an extension of nature, it is perfectly legitimate for Dawkins to use the scientific method to critique the cultural phenomenon of religion.  I would contend that the reverse is also true.  Scientific knowledge, as a part of culture, should not be immune from deconstruction.  Science's diatribe against postmodernism curiously resembles religion's diatribe against science:  \\"Our truth is the only truth,\\" say the priests.  And the scientists.  Anyone whose experience with the biological sciences has been gained primarily from obtaining health care services from anHMO is familiar with the limitations of science.  It was the power/knowledge analysis of Michel Foucault, not the scientific method, that blew the whistle on the medical establishment and other largely unquestioned institutions.  Perhaps the real value of science lies not in absolute truth but in the material benefits realized by those who control it.  If more of those benefits trickled down to the level of the average person, religion might lose some of its appeal and atheism might triumph, even in America.

0393327655|2.0|I heard so much about \\"Letters to a Christian Nation.\\" Unless it's a lot better than this, don't read it, because this book is lucky to get its second star.<br /><br />The things about organized religion that Harris critiques in this book were more deeply addressed by Richard Dawkins in \\"The God Delusion.\\"<br /><br />And that was without Harris' incredible credulity on the existence of psychic phenomena and even reincarnation.<br /><br />I refer to footnote 18, page 45. Here, Harris credits Rupert Sheldrake and Dean Radin as being credible writers on the subject of psi phenomena. Any credible skeptic knows that ain't so.<br /><br />He then goes on to say, \\"There may even be some credible evidence for reincarnation.\\"<br /><br />Well, you slid from five to three stars right there. But wait, that's not all.<br /><br />Harris, in his last chapter, claims that mediation and \\"spiritual\\" practices **as taught under the aegis of Eastern religion** (one can meditate using the Western scientific tool of biofeedback also, etc.) is \\"not a statement of metaphysics.\\" (I have in the past, through self-hypnosis, gone \\"deep\\" enough to see the mandala-like spirals that come right before the tunnel of white light, showing that one can meditate deeply without any \\"spiritual\\" program whatsoever.) Harris also ignores here the fact that \\"mystical\\" traditions in the West, through the vehicle of Gnosticism, had far more social penetrating power than he will admit.<br /><br />In short, his final chapter is about setting Buddhist and other spirituality on a pedestal, undermining the title of his book, now slipping to two stars. That's not to mention undercutting the subtitle about \\"the future of reason.\\"<br /><br />Sam, if you claim that meditation has to really come from an Eastern \\"spiritual\\" discipline, instead of biofeedback, self-hypnosis or other non-\\"spiritual\\" tools, that's a faith statement. Pure and simple.<br /><br />Note this quote on page 221: \\"Mysticism is a rational enterprise.\\" Would that include \\"sky-clad\\" Jains who deliberately starve themselves to death rather than risk swallowing even a microbe?<br /><br />Or, getting to the Buddhism that seems to be Harris' own religion of choice, the fact that the goal of meditation in Buddhism is ultimately nirvana is a metaphysical statement, Sam.<br /><br />And as for Eastern \\"spirituality\\" being more rational, including on the ultimate issue of dying for one's faith: Sam, the Vietnamese Buddhist monks who immolated themselves in the 1960s and 1970s weren't that rational now, were they?<br /><br />And for a philosophy graduate pursuing a graduate degree in neuroscience, Harris either is less than fully informed on his own field or else is reading narrowly in the field.<br /><br />On page 289, note 20, he claims that Western scientific study of meditation has \\"not attempted to localize changes in brain function.\\" That may have been true in 2004, this book's publication date, or the year before, but I don't think so for sure. I believe the brains of meditative subjects were already being fMRI'd then. I know they have been since then, and changes in brain function HAVE been localized to the frontal lobes.<br /><br />Harris contradicts himself elsewhere in the final chapter. In one place, he talks about the \\"selflessness of conscience,\\" when having previously talked so much about the development of the \\"I,\\" which would be the selfISHness of conscience.<br />I also disagree with his claims about the meditative self and subject/object relations on page 212.<br /><br />And, the fact that people like Daniel Wegner and Ran Hassin aren't even in his bibliography show that Harris is reading very narrowly in the field of cognitive science, which should rather be the touchstone of work for a combination philosopher/neuroscientist.<br /><br />And where's Scott Atran's \\"In Gods We Trust\\"? Or Pascal Boyer's \\"Religion Explained\\"? Both are 2002 titles; it's inexcusable for a philosopher/neuroscientist to have neither one in his bibliography.<br /><br />Harris' excellent, literary-quality first chapter manages to salvage a second star for this book.

B000J103PC|4.0|There are only three things wrong with the title of this review for the film \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\"  First, Anne Hathaway is an actress who plays the character of Andy Sachs, but I keep thinking of her as Anne Hathaway as in \\"Now that Anne Hathaway has done sex scenes to get away from the whole Disney-Princess bit she is heading back in that direction in this film\\" instead of as her character.  Second, it was grade Flavor-Aid and not Kool-Aid that was mixed with cyanide and Valium at the order of Jim Jones in Jonestown (and no one who drank it survived) but since the phrase \\"drink the Kool-aid\\" has become part of the vernacular once again historical facts have to take a back seat.  Third, haute couture is used loosely to refer to all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing, but in France is now a protected name that can only be used by French fashion firms that meet well-defined standards.  This time I will embrace the vernacular and my contradictory position on such things.<br /><br />I used this flawed title for my review because for me it defines the pivotal moment in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" that establishes both the film's major strength and its ultimate flaw.  Andy Sachs wants to be a journalist but ends up as the second assistant for Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), editor in chief of \\"Runway\\" magazine (think of something beyond \\"Vogue\\") because maybe a smart \\"fat\\" girl can work where so many skinny well-dressed girls have not.  Andy is fresh from the Midwest and has a level head on her shoulder, so she knows, as do we the audience, that Miranda and everybody else at \\"Runway\\" are pretentious, elitist snobs.  Nigel (Stanley Tucci) is nice, but everybody else follows the lead of Emily (Emily Blunt) and treats Andy as somebody from another planet where nobody dresses well because they buy off the rack.  Taking notes during a meeting that has descended to the question of which belt would be the proper accessory, Andy snickers.  Miranda casts a withering stare at Andy and then proceeds to explain why the sweater Andy is wearing is a direct result of a similar decision made by the people in that room a few years earlier.<br /><br />That is the point where Andy does the Kool-aid drinking, and it was the point at which this film version of the novel by Lauren Weisberger starts to get away from being totally predictable.  When screenwriter Aline Brosh McKennna (\\"Laws of Attraction\\") and director Peter Howitt (\\"Sliding Doors\\") take the fashion business more seriously, which is to say when Andy starts to take it more seriously, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" gains considerably more weight.  Everytime we get back to Andy's boy friend Nate (Adrian Grenier), best friend Lily (Tracie Thoms), and fourth wheel Doug (Rich Sommer), things are a lot less interesting than when she is at the office.  Her job is clearly demanding and her friends take issue with the fact that it might possibly be considered rewarding.  However, I was interested in the idea that Andy would find her niche rather than lose her soul working for Miranda.  Unfortunately, in the end we get back to the predictable path the film laid out in the beginning and the mantra that no job is more important than family and/or friends.  The problem is I do not accept that premise, thinking of plenty of jobs (e.g., teaching) that require you to put the job first (I think of Leo McCary in Season 1 of \\"The West Wing\\" telling his wife that the job he is doing is more important than his family at that point of time; Leo's wife left him, but I have always believed he was right).<br /><br />The net result is that despite another great performance from Streep, Tucci having some fun, and what should be a breakout role for Blunt, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" ends up being nothing more than what it promised to be from the beginning.  I might have liked this 2006 film more without my favorite scene, because at that point I was thinking the film was more ambitious than it turned out to be.  I know that thefilm is probably just being faithful to how the novel ends, but I definitely liked the movie I thought they were making more than the one they were actually making.  At the very least I would have liked to see them walk the tightrope a bit longer, so that the idea Miranda's world was worth living in could be maintained in the last half of the film.  But the whole \\"Hell on Heels\\" bit proves too seductive and if Streep sets up another Oscar nomination by refusing to let her character descend into caricature, the same cannot be said by Hathaway's Andy and this anti-princess cautionary tale.t being faithful to how the novel ends, but I definitely liked the movie I thought they were making more than the one they were actually making.

B000063JZQ|5.0|This is a fierce and visionary interpretation of perhaps the most deceptively simple of Shakespeare's major plays.  The elements of bloody ambition, weak kings with wills overborne by steely women, unjust slaughter and revenge are perhaps the most elemental ingrediants for classic tragedy going back to the Greeks.  The atmosphere is haunted, half-waking and half-sleeping; the key dialogues brutally simple.  The witches' songs linger in your mind from first reading and never go away over your lifetime, like perverse versions of nursery rhymes.  Yet most directors who tackle the play, even some of the greatest, come at it like a car hitting ice and go into a careening skid.  Bad or also-ran Macbeths just don't cut it, anymore than fakey Halloween costumes.<br /><br />Truth is, the play is a garden for the imagination, on paper, but a minefield of hidden traps when someone has the audacity to attempt to film it  -- something more than even that rare audacity is apparently needed to carry it off.  It is possible Polanski's reaction to his wife's own horrific murder provided the extra here, who knows?  Perhaps it gave him \\"eye of newt\\"?  Then toss into the cauldron some $$$ from Hugh Hefner, trying to launder himself from soft core porn king into a major cultural figure ... toe of frog?  Well, something exploded in this cauldron, for sure.  Its scary as hell and hardly because of the blood.<br /><br />On a more mundane level, a workmanlike and intelligent actor like Jon Finch, in his prime and with something to prove, delivered a damn lot to the title role.  His middle of the road, quasi-Everyman interpretation of the murderous anti-hero adds the real potent element to the brew -- something that leaves you saying, \\"this could have been me.\\"  Francesca Annis, also in her prime, delivers splendidly too, and with all the keen reserve of a confident beauty -- sort of reminds us English speakers of what kind of face (and body) likely launched a thousand ships. Plus add Polanski's guts to show real old crones for the witches, naked as diseased old birds on a winter day.  He hardly cared whether your English teacher would laugh. And don't forget the audience -- make the dagger real and palpable, to Lady Macbeth and to us.  Just a figment of the imagination?  Well, that's just another second rate professor's sorry excuse.  This play was not constructed as closet drama, either, and every kid in the English speaking world needs be taught to understand the difference. Macbeth rather was and always shall be a body blow to the mass audience, when delivered properly.  Your professor should have told you too that Shakespeare himself freely altered his texts from performance to performance -- one can only imagine what his molten genius would have done if he ever had a camera in his hands.  Finally, the majestic use of scenery raises everything to the level of dreamscape worthy of Salvadore Dali, and better than anything any surrealist filmmaker (usually rather closet academic types, finally) ever accomplished.  Here, the wedding of waking and sleeping is seamless --just as in Shakespeare's semi-mad, quickly dashed off accidental masterpiece -- perhaps an artistic response to personal tragedy of his own.<br /><br />In sum, this film has well stood up to the test of time.  The contoversies about nudity, Hefner, the Manson gang, and bad boy Polanski are very old news, by now, and ought finally be buried.  They never should have mattered anyway, but unfortunately the film was launched in this climate wherein it provided an easy mark to the chattering classes.  Nor does Polanski's genius require any excuse -- see his Tess and his Chinatown.

B000ESSTL0|4.0|If you are or shortly going to become a 5.1 audiophile then this is a brilliant upgrade from the basic scratched CD you've had all these years. If you have a basic 5.1 rig the audio is fantastic. Not all albums make this leap to the 5.1 world. Albums like this are great in 5.1 because they are complex and dynamic...lots of dramatic sound fx, dual vocal tracks, multiple bass lines. Violator fares well in this psychedelic environment.  <br /> <br />I've tested the 5.1 DVD on my DTS capable rig and the mix may not be as wacky as the Flaming Lips stuff you may have heard...it's a little more subdued and true to the original album...I'd give them maybe 4/5 stars for not including the old music videos paired with the HD audio tracks too. But perhaps it's just too much material for one disc I'm not sure.  <br /> <br />DTS sounds crisp and clear...it's AWESOME. No CD hiss and clipping is reduced in higher decibel levels. You can crank the audio as loud as you want and there is no distortion because of the headroom. Again this is hardware specific...so if you have a decent 5.1 rig you will unleash this kind of fidelity. <br /> <br />It seems a lot of naysayers are those who don't have a 5.1 rig and/or maybe have no clue about 5.1 audio formats. Please don't boohoo this release if you don't have a 5.1 DTS/DD rig. That's what this release is all about!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I love the concept of this CD because to me it renews interest in songs we have heard so many times we can hum them in our sleep. This new take on the Beatles hits makes listening to those great songs interesting again. I also love the fact that what we hear may sound weird but its all still exclusively original beatles recordings (ok except the newly composed arrangement for while my guitar gently weeps which is sensational anyway). <br /> <br />The sound quality is great and the song mix is great. If your a Beatles fan or just a casual observer I really cant see how this could be considered anything other than a great listen. I LOVE it.

0743289412|3.0|This is a difficult book to review.  I'm a big Stephen King fan from WAY back.  There are many beautifully observed moments and striking passages.  And yet the core of the book is frustrating. <br /> <br />It tells the story of Lisey (pronounced Lee-See) and her marriage to Scott, a famous writer.  King wants us to understand he believes each marriage has a \\"secret heart\\" and that sometimes that heart is a heart of darkness.  This novel tells the story of this marriage's secret (and very odd) heart. <br /> <br />The story is told largely in flashback.  We start with Lisey a couple of  years after her husband has died.  She's finally making an effort at going through his voluminous papers, books, chicken-scratch, etc.  The task begins to stir memories of some of their most critical times together and we begin to learn about their past in that manner.  At the same time, Lisey is confronted with a mad-man who believes he's on an almost holy mission to retrieve from Lisey all of Scott's unpublished writings.  He's willing to do pretty much ANYTHING to get them. <br /> <br />Turns out, we discover, that Scott had some unusual supernatural powers that seem to have run through his family.  He can, with some effort, transport himself to an alternative world which he has named \\"Booya Moon.\\"  He went there as a child, and while the place had its lovely elements, it also had some very awful elements, especially at night.  There is also a pool of beautiful, healing, inspirational waters which for Scott apparently provided much of the inspiration for his writing, but which also cause a dangerous lassitude in those who observe it...often preventing them from coming \\"back to earth\\" on their own. <br /> <br />In Lisey's flashbacks, we see how she first learned of this place, how she learned of her husband's almost unbelievably strange and traumatic childhood (how he ever turned out even close to normal is never explained) and how he twice faced death.  We really never see any of the \\"normal\\" times of their lives, or frankly, their happy times.  The writer we meet is a difficult man.  He would be darn hard to love.  Yet Lisey loved him...we just don't \\"feel\\" why she did.  She tells us she did...but I never understood it. <br /> <br />King has written a lot of books and stories...especially lately, about the tough inner lives that creative people, especially writers, go through.  This is a theme that is getting, frankly, quite old.  After he introduced himself as a main character in THE DARK TOWER series...he pretty much exhausted that theme.  But by golly, he can keep pounding at it.  We get it...being brilliant and successful and an \\"artist\\" ain't all it's cracked up to be.  Boo hoo!! <br /> <br />Eventually Lisey must pull herself away from her recollections and deal with the madman who will surely kill her (he certainly injures her quite gravely in one brief but horrific scene), and she must also deal with her sisters, whose demands on her at this crucial time are awkward at best.  Lisey even makes a few trips to Booya Moon on her own. <br /> <br />I think King envisioned that he had written the story of an \\"epic\\" marriage.  I believe the story moved him a great deal...and as I said, there are many beautiful and moving passages (some of the best stuff comes early, when Lisey remembers the horrible day her husband was nearly killed by an assassin).  But for me, the sum total amounted to a shrug of the shoulders and a dismissive smile at the self-indulgent take on writers.  (Although I will admit that King is always upfront about the staggering amounts of money successful writers make, and easily admits how much easier this makes life.  Good for him.) <br /> <br />There are so many elements in the book I haven't even touched on.  It's a very non-linear work, and while I don't mind at all jumping around in time and structure...I think as the book went along it diffused any power it might have been building.  Also, Lisey is largely a cipher ofa character...mostly acted upon, not acting (until the end).  Her \\"co-star\\" Scott is a bore and often a boor.   <br /> <br />The book still moves fast...King seldom has problems with pace.  I don't regret having read it...but I just can't put it up their with his best (although it isn't down there with the worst, either.)  Recommended for fans only, I think. <br />
B000J10ERO|3.0|I've read quite a few reviews of this film here at amazon.  Most of them are very valid (even with wildly diverse ratings).  I gave it 3 stars because I was entertained.  I noticed many of the story flaws and raised many of the same questions in my mind that many reviewers noted.  Usually planet sized story/plot holes bug the crap out of me.  But for some reason, I still enjoyed \\"Superman Returns\\".<br /><br />The one thing that really distracted me as the film went along, was the blatant, obvious rehashing of the story of Christ.  Why this was a point of interest of the film makers I don't know.  I could have done without it.  I'm not against the teachings of Christ (anti-Christ?), but does it really belong in a Superman film?<br /><br />I'm sure many (most) of the people who saw this film noticed the Christ parody. If you're not sure you've noticed them all, here's a list of stuff that I noticed that might help:<br /><br />-Supermans dad, (Jorell/God?) says (I paraphrase) \\"Humans are basically good so should be protected (saved)from evil(sin).  So I give them my Son.\\"<br /><br />-Bitter Lois says the world does not need a savior (Superman).  Superman says he can here everything, the cries for help.  \\"Sounds to me like they need a Savior\\".<br /><br />-Superman on a couple of occasions says \\"I'm everywhere, I'll always be around\\".  May the Lord Superman be with you.<br /><br />-Superman gets Lois pregnant without actually doing the deed. (that whole \\"spin the world backward to reverse time\\" trick in Superman 2}.  A fairly immaculate conception.<br /><br />-Superman sacrifices himself to save the \\"good\\" humans for the \\"sinful bad\\" humans.  He died to save humans from human sin (a bit stretchy, but not too much)<br /><br />-Superman is reserected from the dead.  (happy Easter Superman!)<br /><br />-Superman flys to the outer reaches of Earths atmosphere and creates a cross by extending his arms out to the side and pointing his legs straight down.  (Not well disguised BTW).<br /><br />I'm probably missing something, but that's a pretty long list of coincidences.  As much as I enjoyed the movie with it's stupid story/plot holes, great special effect, fun acting and cameos, I really could have done without the Idea that our God(s) are actually Kryptonians and Superman is our savior.  That is enough to lose a star in my rating.  In a nutshell, this film, though not great, is entertaining.  There are some slow spots, and it ends with a fizzle.  And you will have to be someone who is not offended easily when it comes to religeous mockery.

I feel like I've been through and experience after listening to the album.  Now in my 40s, I still listen to this album more than almost any other.  I would put this work up against other all-time bests such as Clash - London Calling, REM - Murmur, Radiohead - the Bends, and Nirvana - Nevermind as highest impact recordings.  Put on a set of headphones and listen in a darkened room.  Enjoy it.
B0002NRQTS|4.0|I was reading through reviews of other Rush albums and people seemed to take negative shots quite a bit at this one.  I will say that I am not a huge fan of 70's Rush but do rather like a lot of their 80's stuff, and of course their early 90's stuff is really good, up until Test for Echo which is really where they lost me. <br /> <br />Presto is an album that actually flows quite well from the starting track of Show Don't Tell to the last Available Light.  Though their sound is not quite as storybookish as those on Hold Your Fire, it does rock pretty hard on certain tracks, but more than that the lyrics aren't half bad on the standout tracks Anagram, Red Tide(which is a very political song about environmental issues, which is even more pertinent now then it was in 1989), and Hand Over Fist, easily the best tracks on this album.  While you won't find epic tracks like Force Ten and Tai Shan, you will find great drumming as usual by Neal Peart and some inspired guitar licks by Alex Lifeson, and of course Geddy Lee is always consistent.  Give it a shot.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Originally released on August, 3 1987, Hysteria was the follow up for Pyromania, released on January 1983 (over 4 1/2 years earlier). The original disc contains 12 tracks, 63 minutes of music.  This special edition deluxe dual disk contains the 12 original tracks plus four b-side tracks.  Three of these songs were rerecorded years later for the Retroactive album released in 1993, and one for the Adrenalize album, released in 1992.  The second disk contains 5 songs live,  a couple of outakes, or not so final drafts of songs from the Hysteria album and and extra track voiced by their tour person-chef-caretaker Mr. Mortimer.    Original 12 Tracks:  1) Women: First track released in the US July 1987. The song is great but not worth releasing as a first single.  It doesn't really represent of what album consists of at the time. It probably got more airplay from MTV than from the radio stations. It has a base groove similar to Juke Box Hero from Foreigner; with that sound and Rick Allen's electric snare parts (from his left foot) I sometimes visualize Darth Vader in Star Wars for some weird reason. 4 of 5  2) Rocket: Seventh single released on Feb. 1989.  This is their homage to their musical heroes growing up in the 70's.  They make many musical references, and it's one of their most exploring in the studio console sounding tracks The track is also dominated by a loops of drum machine parts and bits taken from Love Bites and Gods Of War. A shorter version was recorded for their music video and is also found their greatest hits albums (US release). 4 of 5  3) Animal: Second Single released in the US Oct. 1987, and first single released everywhere else three months earlier.  Now this song should of been released simultaneously in the US, but I guess for whatever reason I did not happen, or where they were touring in those months, I don't know. This song helped the momemtum as far as album sales and radio airplay, but they were still behind to at least break even on the recording and production and mixing costs of the album. The song sounds great and you can clearly hear the influence from their producer Mutt Lange, and his influence in producing for Foreigner and specially The Cars \\"Heartbreak City\\" and how he contributed to this album. 5 of 5  4) Love Bites: Fifth single released in July 1988. Their first no.1 hit. love song , power ballad, whatever you want to call it.  Well put together. 4 of 5.  5) Pour Some Sugar On Me: Fourth single released in April 1988.  Their most successful song of their carreer. It atracted the mainstream crowd big time and it contributed to the multimillion album sales during the summer. The sounded ahead of its time and it still sounds great now.   5 of 5  6) Armaggedon It:   (I'll finish this again later...)        Original 12 Tracks: 5 of 5  B- Sides: 5 of 5  Live Songs: 5 of 5  Extended Versions: 4 of 5    Overall Rating: 5 of 5
B000ICL3KG|5.0|First and foremost, Al Gore is not telling us anything that we who have followed this issue do not already know.  This presentation succeeds because it sums up all the information on global warming in an easier to understand format than what might be put out by scientific authority.  The documentary is shocking, sad and most definitely poignant.   <br /> <br />To the point, I am so tired of hearing ignorant folks, stupidly proclaiming that they see no evidence for severe global change.  People will believe what they are going to believe until all hell comes down on their foolish heads. Most of these ignorant folks also claim to be Christians but throwout and forget at will verses t;hat proclaim that \\"when the Lord comes back he will destroy those who have destroyed the Earth,\\" and the verses saying that we are suppossed to be stewards for the planet, not to rape and pillage to make a quick buck.  The thing is that there is no excuse for ignorance, except that fact that the US media is not regulated, this happenned in 1988 under former president Reagan, and that most of our news is shockingly unfair and not balanced and tilts drastically to the right.  I saw RFK Jr. give a speech on the environment and the criminal acts at CWU in November of this year and was shocked about some of the things that have happenned during the Bush regime.  This administration is guilty of so much but unfortunately will probably get away clean after leaving office, though a Higher Authority is keeping score.  I definitely suggest you pick up a copy of Robert F. Kennedy's book, Crimes Against Nature(2004) and do your own research if you don't think the facts are conclusive from Al Gore and RFK Jr.
0792839749|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies from childhood.<br /><br />The movie stars Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes,Lionel Jeffries and Benny Hill. The plot centers around a very talented but nere do well mechanical engineer/widower named Caractacuss Potts, his two children Jeremay and Jemimah,his father and Truly Scrumptious, the daughter of the local candy baron. Caractacuss invents a candy called \\"Toot Sweets\\" which after much encouragement from Truly he presents to the local candy baron,Lord Scrumptious. However he ends up blowing the deal as the candy literally goes to the dogs by calling them into the candy factory. Caractacuss feeling as a failure purchases a once famous race car from Mr. Coggins the local junk man and transforms it into the famous Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, named so because this is the sound the engine makes. The Potts family along with Truly go to the seaside for a picnic where Caractacuss spins a tale of the famous Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and her encounter with the evil Baron of Vulgaria and her ulitmate triumph in liberating the country and her people. The musical score is brillant from the Sherman Brothers. My favorite song is when Lionel Jeffries sings the song \\"Posh\\" while being transported in his \\"hut\\" in midair. Benny Hill is a riot as the toy maker. This movie is great fun for the entire family!
B000AP04NI|4.0|The musical is blessed with so many easy-to-hum tunes and simple lyrics, which make it such a delight to watch. The outdoor scenes are well captured and the people are young and energetic.    There is also one very appealing factor - Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones make a perfect couple. When they sing the duet and swing with the melody, one can feel the happiness radiating from their faces. And Gordon MacRae sings his part with the most expression while Roy Steiger is the villain whose life begs sympathy. Shirley Jones is so special that fighting for her hand is inevitable.     The modern version of Oklahoma (Hugh Jackman) is another successful adaptation with strong voice, stage arrangement and acting. Nevertheless, this 1955 version is still one that gives great delight to those who loves music and countryside.
B0000026T4|1.0|This was Alice's big comeback album.  The single \\"Poison\\" got him back on top 40 radio for the first time in years, and the album was a huge success.  Cooper was back to playing big arenas in front of sold out crowds.  But......I think the album stinks.  The music is cliche ridden hair metal and most of the lyrics are just plain stupid.  Compared to most of the Coop's other work this dreck just does not hold up.
B00069YE0W|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. John continually amazes me. Its hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks. Personal favorites include \\"Past Recedes,\\" \\"The Real\\" and \\"Your Warning.\\" I'm surprised at some of the reviews on this site. I dont understand how someone cant appreciate this man's talent.  <br />
B0000028PI|5.0|Now this is more like it.  Kane Roberts and Kip Winger are out of the picture as Cooper works with a new band that includes \\"Derrick Sherinian\\" of Dream Theater fame.  \\"The Last Temptation\\" is the first of a trilogy of three Christian oriented works that serve as mini morality plays that deal with temptation and redemption.  Cooper has always used collaborators when writing his material and on this disc he brings in Tommy Shaw (Styx), Jack Blades (Nightranger, Damn Yankees), and Chris Cornell (Soundgarden, Audioslave).  The results are Alice's best album in almost two decades.  The album is a concept piece that basically deals with the main character being tempted by the devil (disguised as a circus barker).  There is a comic book that accompanies the album telling the story.  I have not read the comic so I don't know the story in detail, but musically it works like a charm.  The music on the album moves away from the hair metal sound of his last 4 releases and instead turns back to a sound similar to his classic 70's sound, although it still sounds modern and fresh.  The single \\"Lost In America\\" got some airplay and is still a staple of Cooper's live shows.  The song showcases Cooper's sense of humor, something that had been missing for a while.  Pretty much every song on the disc is good; \\"Sideshow\\", \\"Nothing's Free\\", \\"Bad Place Alone\\", \\"It's Me\\" and the closer \\"Cleansed By Fire\\" are all winners.  Another highlight is \\"Stolen Prayer\\", where Cooper shares vocals with Chris Cornell for a killer performance from both.  \\"Last Temptation\\" is probably Coopers most underrated album and in my opinion is a must have for his fans.
0307275639|5.0|What a wonderful story.  I just finished watching the movie and reading the book.  The man definately had a great load of intelligance and charisma to boot. This book has given me a lot of thought on life. Any chance you have, tell the ones you love how much you appreciate them. Love each other, or perish.  I have written tons of notes about the lessons Morrie shared with Mitch and the world. Even though he did not get the love and affection he wanted as a child, he was able to learn and grow from his childhood.  Therefore, he soaked up all the love he could possibly find, and share it with every person he met. I hope that in my lifetime, I will be able to experience this type of closeness to someone. I recommend this book to everyone and anyone who can breathe, talk, and listen. This book really speaks to your heart.
B0000027DJ|2.0|I seem to be in the minority here, but this album did very little for me.  There are a few good songs, but overall I think it is weaker than both \\"Constrictor\\" and \\"Raise Your Fist And Yell\\".
0099481685|4.0|I am a Protestant minister and appreciated the interlude this book brought to a very busy season.  For the clergy, Christmas is something else again.  While the world spins out of control around us, we focus on the short hours we will be spending in church the Sundays in Advent and Christmas Eve.  We want in the worst way for it all to be meaningful, but realize people are pulled apart with responsibilities related to Christmas preparations.  Grisham accurately and comically makes us laugh at the whole thing, while still honoring Christmas and Christmas customs.<br /><br />The book is touching in its emphasis on family.  Krank and his wife will do anything to \\"make Christmas\\" for their daughter.<br /><br />I like the way the minister in the book is characterized.  He is pastoral in the extreme.  The minister (Methodist) meets Nora, Krank's wife, in the mall (he is shopping!) and immediately notices something different about her, gets her to sit with him a while and skillfully explores her \\"spiritual state.\\"  The church is treated with respect in this book.<br /><br />The ending of the book was obvious to some reviwers, but not to me.  It was unexpected and has a \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" feel about it.  The ending is a sweet reminder of what Christmas can be - in the midst of the flurry and stress, human love prevails and triumphs.<br /><br />If you want a few chuckles and a three hour break from the travail of Christmas preparations, this short book will enlighten the season.
B0002X1JKU|5.0|A must read for all investors, also very technical so must read at least once or twice a year.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Thirty years after \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" mesmerized us with \\"Paradise By The Dashboard Light\\" and thirteen years after \\"Bat Out of Hell II\\" and \\"I'd Do Anything for Love\\", Jim Steinman, Todd Rundgren, and Meat Loaf have combined once again to produce this teriffic addition to the other \\"Bat\\" albums. <br /> <br />What really separates this album from the others is the fine female voices recruited to sing along with Meat Loaf.  Marion Raven is simply fantastic on \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\", a song originally written by Steinman for Celine Dion.  I like this version much better, and it is easily the best track on the album.  Patti Russo is excellent on the ballad \\"What About Love\\", and Jennifer Hudson lends her vocal talents on \\"The Future Ain't What It Used To Be\\".  Steinman's classic \\"Bad For Good\\", \\"Blind As A Bat\\", and the title track showcase Meat Loaf's vocal abilities, and the signature harmony vocals and rock opera sound are present on all of the tracks. <br /> <br />I give this album my highest recommendation.  I've been a fan of Meat Loaf for many years, and this is one of his best efforts.  Everything that one has come to expect from Meat Loaf is here; the great insturmentals, the story-like lyrics, and the harmonic vocals.  This great album deserves its own place alongside the first two albums in the trilogy.  Meat Loaf has definitely revived his career with this strong album.  Listen to \\"Bat Out of Hell III\\" and hear the continuation of a classic trilogy.
076790592X|5.0|The book was outstanding. I read the book as well as watched the DVD and I must say the book is much better. This book was wonderfully written and easy read, short but very inspiring, a book you cannot put down once you get started.  It reminds us of the importance of life, what is really important, not things but family and loving each other.  I really connected with this book and Professor Morrie Schwartz inspirational life lessons.  This book helped me understand and put things in perspective, as I recently loss my father suddenly, it was uplifting to read.  I recommend this book for the young and those suffering from terminal disease.  In addition, to Morrie's \\"life's greatest lessons!\\" I also appreciated Professor Schwartz and Mitch Albom allowing us in on his Tuesday's spent with Moorie as he battled the terminal disease of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) It's a must read for all.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I didn't even know that Sarah had a Christmas CD out until I saw her perform the Joni Mitchell song \\"River\\" on an episode of Martha a couple of weeks ago. Wow- I was blown away. I went right out and bought this CD and it is the most beautiful Christmas CD I have ever owned. I highly recommend this CD to everyone. Merry Christmas!
B000JJRIN4|2.0|I feel terrible for saying it but this is not Gwen's finest. I have been a fan of Gwen's since No Doubt came onto the mainstream scene. I absolutely loved every song on Love.Angel.Music.Baby. but there are only three tracks on this album that I care for. Early Winter and 4 in the Morning both have sweet, intelligible lyrics and Wonderful Life isn't bad. The rest of the songs on the album are kind of silly and not in a fun way. Maybe my expectations were too high following her last piece of work but this album just didn't work for me.
B000J10ERO|1.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time, but after I did, I wish I hadn't. The disappointment was that huge.<br /><br />The acting was atrocious and all over the map. The set design was grand but seemed more like the landscapes of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, rather than the Richard Donner feel of the first two installments in the series.<br /><br />There were plot inconsistencies all over the place and things that just didn't make any sense (example: where did Superman get the spaceship to travel back to earth from if his home planet had been destroyed years ago? Also, why is Superman in such agony when he returns to earth since the film makes it clear that he is always enjoying some R and R in outer space before returning to earth).<br /><br />There was zero spark between Clark and Lois this time around, which compared to Reeve and Kidder, shows just how much the filmmakers missed the mark.<br /><br />And Superman would never have that much trouble stopping a plane from crashing. I mean look at the ease he caught the falling helicopter in the first film. He's Superman, not Bruce Wayne or Peter Paker (actual humans). I think the filmmakers forgot which superhero they were working with.<br /><br />At 150 minutes it is way too long to sustain interest.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I may not believe in crop circles, but I sure do believe in Santa!  I watched the Polar Express for the first time, and I fell in love with it!  I had hesitated watching it because I happened to read a critic's take on the animation and the \\"lifeless eyes\\" of the characters, yadda yadda (what do critics know, anyway?).  Finally, while channel chasing one evening, I caught up with this movie and found myself so totally absorbed with the story and the wonder of it that I was actively breathing a sigh of relief when the train made it over the frozen water, and gasping with wonder at the artists' take of Santa's City (so *that's* how they load Santa's sleigh).  I even got teary-eyed during several of the scenes.  Yes, this is a wonderful movie and a classic to have and watch during future Christmases!
B000002UA9|5.0|Significant moments in history always fog hindsight. With a swift machete-chop they bisect an era into mutually exclusive units of \\"before\\" and \\"after.\\" People firmly situated in the \\"after\\" of such a Krakatoa event must contort their brains to conceive of life \\"before\\" that historical line was etched. For instance, those born long after the Viking raid of  Beatlemania probably have trouble conceiving of pop music culture before the Fab Four's inexorable arrival. After all, those deities of the 1960s mainstream were once nobodies. They once could traipse down the street without being hogpiled by screaming flailing fans. Before 1963 few wanted pieces of their clothing, their autographs, thier underwear, or even less mentionable things. \\"Please Please Me,\\" their first album, changed that with a zap. Thousands of flat vinyl cylinders whirling at 33 1/3 sliced into the conscious of a generation. And then nothing seemed the same in the eternal \\"after.\\" The \\"before\\" became, and remains, almost incomprehensible.<br /><br />People across the ocean from Her Majesty's domain hadn't yet felt the tremors. They would soon be bowled over, but \\"Please Please Me\\" remained a British phenomenon even after the Ed Sullivan Show. Americans instead received a hybrid album, called \\"Meet The Beatles,\\" made up of singles and other bits. In fact, all of the songs on their first British album weren't released in the U.S. until 1965 with \\"The Early Beatles.\\" Even in the LP era, \\"Please Please Me\\" remained difficult, but not impossible, to find in the United States. The CD releases of the 1980s forever corrected this piece of marketing butchery. Now we're all on the same page.<br /><br />This album has a naked and raw sound compared with their subsequent releases. Going back again to that murky time when they were relatively unknown, Parlophone, their British label, had no reason to see cascading dollar signs under those Counsin Itt moptops. To the suits, this was just another band riding the industry conveyor belt. On a budget for the first and last time, the group recorded the entire album, with George Martin behind the glass, live in a single breakneck session at Abbey Road. No overdubs. No studio tricks. They played No. 2 Studio like they played the Cavern Club. As such, this album captures the young band's live sound better than any known recording. Their energy and skill is undeniable. The frenzy that followed remains somewhat understandable.<br /><br />From this innocent beginning The Beatles would revolutionize the music and recording industries. Going forward, the band had progressively more control over the studio recordings and even over the album art. This cover, taken at EMI's Manchester Square offices, remains their only cover that was somebody else's idea. Six years later, a cosmic eyeblink, they would reprise it for an unused \\"Let it Be\\" cover before fading into legend (the picture ended up on the cover of the 1967-1970 \\"Blue\\" album). \\"Please Please Me\\" stands on that historic threshold dividing the eras of \\"before Beatles\\" and \\"after Beatles.\\" Something made them different. Something about them spoke, and continues to speak, to millions. Those of us forever stuck in the amber of the \\"after\\" will continue to reap the benefits of the changes they made while pondering just how they pulled it off.

B00000099Y|5.0|there are just not enough words to describe the perfection that the masters Maynard, Justin, Danny and Adam have mastered on this album, as always. Personally, Aenima is my favorite of the and a few between of TOOL. Great and powerful lyrics, LEAST to say, and the dynamically beautiful and rhythmic ways of the music.....plainly said, BUY IT!!! its powerful, MEANINGFUL, pure, arousing, amusing, and poetically impudent. Everything music should be...EXPRESSION.

0800141601|1.0|The movie wasn't even close to anything from the Arthurian legends, the plot was weak. The acting was good but it goes to show you that even superb actors can't overcome a fatally weak, cliche-driven script. What a waste of an opportunity to make a great movie.<br /><br />The cliches begin with Malagant (Ben Cross) - a character manufactured by Hollywood who combines all that is evil, \\"wears black\\", slaughters the innocent for sport, etc.<br /><br />Lancelot (Richard Gere) - an unbelievable man-of-the-1990's character foils the evil Malagant, marries Guinevere (Julia Ormond), now Arthur's (Sean Connory) widow and they live happily ever after.<br /><br />If this appeals to you, RENT the movie. I can't imagine you'd ever want to buy it for your personal library unless you are teaching the History of Bad Movies.<br /><br />Hey Amazon, you need a \\"half a star\\" rating for situations just such as this.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Lightning McQueen is a rookie race car in a world populated by cars, trucks and other vehicles.  Lightning is the hottest rookie around and he has a shot at the top title.  But a rematch sends him to California.  Unfortunately he gets lost on the way and winds up in Radiator Springs, a small town along old Route 66.  His visit gets him in trouble and he winds up being stuck in town while performing community service. <br /> <br />At first Lightning is a smug egotist.  All he thinks about is himself.  He does not care about others.  But the people and the relaxed attitude of Radiator Springs starts to leave its mark on the race car.  Soon he realizes that caring about others is important.  His personality begins to change.  Soon he is back on his way to California for his chance at the title. <br /> <br />This is a fun and creative movie.  The story at the heart of the film is as every bit a classic as Dickens's A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  A strong and clear message that shows you can be good and successful at the same time.  The whole car motif is carried all the way even using tiny VW bugs as the world's insects.  Good characters help fill out the story.  Two additional stories are included.  One is Mater and the Ghostlight (the Ghostlight is mentioned in the film) and the second is a delightful tale of two performers competing for the coin of a young child (this on is called One-Man Band).  The film itself ends with an epilogue that was not in the theater that I thought was pretty good and in keeping with the tone and ending of the film.  All in all just a really fun movie that the whole family can enjoy.  Check it out.
B00005JPB6|4.0|Iwo Jima (\\"Sulfur Island\\" in Japanese) is a little island six hundred miles south of Tokyo. (Today there is only a Japanese military base now, and you cannot visit the island.) But the name of the island got famous immediately after one photo was taken and published in America nationwide during WWII. The memorable image of six soldiers raising a flag gave courage to the people in America, and three surviving soldiers returning their country became national heroes. It's a famous story. <br /> <br />Clint Eastwood's new film `Flags of Our Fathers' does not try to `debunk' this story. It gives human face to these flag-holing soldiers without over-glorifying them, showing what happened to these heroes John \\"Doc\\" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) before, during, and after the Battle of Iwo Jima. Familiar actors like Jamie Bell, Paul Walker, Robert Patrick and Barry Pepper appear, but the three above play the pivotal roles here.    <br />  <br />Remember this is a war movie, and the battle scenes on the beach are often disturbing. (One of the film's producers is Steven Spielberg). Though the fight scenes are less bloody and brutal than those of `Saving Private Ryan,' they are still honest, often shocking, not only because of the bullets and grenades, but because of the confusion and total chaos of the grey-colored battlefield. Eastwood refuses to soften or sensationalize anything, but the results are riveting. <br /> <br />Though the film's theme is clear, its narrative requires our patience a little. The film's story goes back and forth (screenplay part done by Paul Haggis, `Crush'), and this only makes the film look slightly detached from us. The disjointed story requires us to reconstruct, not follow, the experiences of the soldiers. The emotions are certainly there on the screen (thanks to the effective acting), but I am not sure that this is the best way to visualize them. But as I said, the three actors did a fine jobas three soldiers who travel around the country for Bond rallies where they have to face another reality during wartime - they are war heroes and people expect them to behave as such.  <br /> <br />Finally, some people, not without good reason, say this film is dull. It is true that Eastwood's films tend to be slow, and he takes time to show certain things about the characters. He avoids melodramatic storytelling and showy camerawork, and that does not change in this film. If the battle scenes look confusing, it is perhaps because the war is confusing. If the descirtios of their life as war hero look boring, that is because it is really boring; they were required to do the same thing again and again before finally being forgotten. We just share their feeling, but perhaps too much of it. <br /> <br />This is Clint Eastwood's most ambitious film (and there is \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" still waiting), and maybe too ambitious as far as its screenplay is concerned. I am impressed with the film, however, with the sincere message from the director who realized the one of the saddest events in history for both people in America and Japan with his touch subtle and powerful at the same time.
0446528056|2.0|I was dissappointed when I read this book.  Normally, I rush out and buy every book he writes, then I can't stop reading them.  When I finished this one, I just sat there and thought, \\"Wow, that was just not good.\\"  All that anticipation for a book, then I am not even satisfied.  I will have to try his next one.
B000002AP1|5.0|This album has to be one of the singlemost important albums in rock history. I mean, who else played like this in the '70's? I saved my allowance for a month to buy this in 73 because I thought the cover looked so cool, and when I put it on, I never heard anything like it. I thought Iggy must have been some kind of freak to be screaming and shouting like that, but at the same time, I was fascinated with this beautiful noise coming from my speakers. Then I heard the Grand Funk Live album and it was all over. I was a confused teenager, but I found true love in rock and roll.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|No doubt is an incredible band thanks to Gwen and I own all of their music.  I own LAMB and only really like about 4 songs.  I love What you waiting for from that disc.  I hate Holla Back girl.  I was skeptical about this disk and dislike the first single Wind it up.  I heard a  few new tracks and thought she was nuts.  For some reason, i continued to listen to them and they not only grew on me, but i can appreciate where she is going and what she was trying to do.  For instance, Yummy is really cool.  I will hate it if i hear it on the radio a million times, but listen to it a couple of times and im sure you will agree that its a Hot track.  There are other songs that are realy good too.  I dont care if this CD does well or not, I appreciate and enjoy about half of this CD and gave it a 4 star rating because it is like nothing on the radio now and it is good to hear something new and interesting.  Not a classic by any means but a great sound that im sure many people will steal from and have their own hits.  Give it a listen.
B000GY729M|2.0|Killers were to save the world, until this bomb dropped. Great first 2 songs, only for this album to dissolve into a pukey panic attack. Flat production, overly wordy nervous singer dooms \\"Sams Town\\" into the used bin. Surprisingly utterly forgettable, some tracks deserving the skip button. Higher expectations drive this down to 2 stars maybe less. Unfortunate, we must look for new saviors
B00070Q7VO|4.0|I had to get this cd after seeing him on Dancing with the Stars, and it doesn't disappoint!
B00003OSTV|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies from childhood. I also read the book and would have to say this movie captures the spirit of the book in a very PG way, which makes it a good family movie. The story pervades with conflicting desire and duty. The questions of faith and morality. As well as political intrigue, the events within Neros court are based on the writings of Roman historians. I thought that the movie did a very good job in creating a conflict between Nero and Christianity. On one hand there is Nero who believe himself a god and demands worship. On the other hand there are the Christians who believe in a Kingdom in Heavan and that Christ is their king. I really enjoy this movie when I was a child, and continue into adulthood.

0684867621|3.0|While I enjoyed this short story of survival as a typical King read and move on work of fiction (Insomnia only comes once in a while and The Stand comes once in a lifetime), I was blown away at what I consider a major flaw in King's research.  His name is Jason V-A-ritek, not V-E-ritek.  Come on Stephen!  While I am sure you know how to spell it now, how could you, as someone heavily tied to Red Sox Nation, misspell any of the players names.<br /><br />I am glad to see you redeemed yourself in Faithful.
B000063Y8F|5.0|Well, it appears everyone likes this press... and why not.  It is incredibly beautiful, but more than that, its functionality is second to none.  I don't know about you, but I like to press my garlic without peeling it, but this means that you have to dig the peel out of the press after each clove of garlic.  You can't see this from the picture, but this press is not as simple as a regular press.  Not only does it press perfect garlic, but when you pull the handle back after squeezing, the holey plate that the garlic is pressed through comes up out of the press so that all you have to do is push the remaining peel (and that is all that is remaining) off the face and into the bin.  It couldn't be simpler.  It is such a pleasure to use that it almost makes me want to press garlic for fun...   <br /> <br />It is pricey, however if you are a person that gets pleasure from a functional and beautiful kitchen tool, then this is worth every cent!
B00009ATIX|5.0|I bought this movie as a gift for my dad for Christmas last year. I had no desire to see it but we ended up watching it. I enjoyed the movie a lot. The movie is emotionally compelling, mentally stirring, and leaves an air of mystery about it. One thing that surprised me was that I found myself really caring about the main character and his wife. It surprised me because I rarely get that engrossed in a love story. What was happening between them stirred the same emotion as the end of Romeo and Juliet. You watch those final scenes helpless to do anything but with a glimmer of hope that everything will be allright (although you know it isn't). It is that mix of emotions the movie stirred in me that made me love it. I would suggest this movie to people who are like movies that work with human emotion.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I really enjoy watching movies of natural disaster and what people do to get through it. I think it is great movie and is one that I would watch numerous times.
B000AMJG4Y|2.0|Amazing visual experience, and I don't even have an HDTV. The details are immaculate and gorgeous, and the fight scenes are insane... but that's about it. Unless you are a die hard fan of the series, this movie will completely fail to carry itself in terms of story and character development. Dialogue is bland, and it is very unlikely that you'll care about what's going on and why. Disappointed :(
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I am a long time Beatles fan...that being said, I expected something special from this latest re-mix of their old catalog, by Sir George Martin and his son. <br />I must say it was a bit disappointing.  The only songs that were worth me giving this a 3 star rating were \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weaps\\"...the rest of the material was \\"average\\".  The recording quality is very good however.  I think this release is more about promoting the Cirque de Solei show in Las Vegas... <br />If you already own these Beatles classics....you can skip this disc...I wish I had!
B000IMUYJM|4.0|I first saw this on select tv in 1979 , and I remember it really freaked me out. At the time the movie was called \\"Stranger in the house\\". and I   was not able to find it , due to another film with the same title that had to do with a witch. I didn't know it was called \\"black christmas\\" until now and I am hoping it will still chill me as it did in 79, looking forward for the new version , in theaters.    I Still think this movie is great after finally seeing this on dvd after 22 years. I showed this to some friends and reletives. And then some one had to make a remake of this film (which I saw on x-mas day), and it was the biggest bunch of  B. S. I ever seen.  3-21-07
0060594888|5.0|Jack Canfield certainly needs no help in recommending himself!<br /><br />Yet, as someone who has NEVER found any motivational \\"success\\" books anything but a waste of time and space, I feel almost obligated to write this review because I LOVE THIS BOOK.<br /><br />I am a serious underachiever.  I truly believe that if I continue to practice the strategies that are so lucidly set forth in this book, that may change.  And even if it doesn't, I will be a happier person.<br /><br />This may sound like hyperbole, but I felt like a new person after reading just the first 1/3rd of the book.  I started doing many of the things he writes about.  I started to feel very good.  VERY good!<br /><br />I started networking without even thinking about it.  My outlook on life became more positive and self promoting without being insincere. That's the beauty of what Canfield writes about.  It's not about BSing yourself and others.  It's about discovering and aspiring to the best in yourself and honoring it, celebrating it and being the success you can be, whether financial or not.  It's not necessarily about the money.<br /><br />Though making millions like Jack Canfield wouldn't hurt, either.
0812550706|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I was very skeptical at first. I have never been a science fiction or fantasy novel reader. But I bought the book anyway and found that I couldn't put this book down!<br /><br />The whole book gives you the impression that it is leading up to something bigger, but in the end the book twists on itself and gives you an ending you never would have guessed!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone! Orson Scott Card knew what he was doing when he wrote an entire epic about a small child with the weight of the world on his shoulders. After I read this book I went out and bought the entire rest of the series because I was hooked!
B00005JPDJ|5.0|I just got back from watching the new movie the Holiday in the theater starring Camren Diaz and Kate Winslett that is so funny and it is also very heartfelt too. The characters are all very very believable and because they are so funny and you laugh at them that you believe that they are real peopl!! Nancy Myers directed this movie and I think that she wrote the screenplay too and she has a great ear for dialogue because the dialogue is funny and makes you laugh but it also makes you smile like Jack Black is great in this movie!! Kate and Cameren are a great screen team because they are both pretty ladies who can act and if you watch The Mask with Cameron Diaz and Titanic with Kate Winslett or something with Jude Law in it, you will know what I mean. The funnyest part in the holiday was the part when Cameron Diaz who's character name is Amanada when she is walking in her high heel shoes and she slips on a patch of ice and then she grabs onto that tree branch that is covered in snow and the snow falls all over her head and face and gets on her head too!! That part alone is worth the ticket price and it will probably have you rolling in the eyulls unless you don't think this sort of thing is not funny but I don't really see how that could be possible unless you don't like comedies or something. Youll have a jollyday at the HOliday!!!!!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|Beautiful to look at! The vistas--mountains, highways, prairies, etc.--are gorgeous. And the cars are so shiny, how do the artists do that?! The cars are also full of personality, with wonderful performances by Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt and every single other character. I also loved the sweet, nostalgic storyline, about Route 66 and the changing American landscape. Anyone of any age who loves a road trip will love this family movie, and the kids will want to watch it over and over. The DVD is loaded with special features, too. Ka-chow!
0765315246|5.0|I took this book on vacation with me and all I wanted to do was find out what happened next.  For me, this is one of those books that I just couldn't put down and was really sad when I reached the last page.  Great story, I highly recommend this book.
0399230033|5.0|I used to read this to my preschoolers by request - it was a permanent fixture in our library and I was not allowed to swap it out for new books!  My kids would look for it if I took it away and I would have to bring it back.  The Gorilla lets out all the animals in the zoo and follows the zoo keeper home!  Mrs zoo keeper is not amused with her roomful of animals and Mr. zoo keeper has to return all the animals to their cages.
0618680004|3.0|I was disappointed in this book.  I expected an interesting philosophical discussion on the issue.  The book starts out good enough, but then dissolves into protestation directed toward his critics.  Mr. Dawkins clearly has thought through the topic, is a good writer, and is very intelligent, but his book is disappointing in that he is so critical of others.  I wish he had refrained from the sarcasm that laces each page.  I cannot recommend this book to anyone who wants an intelligent thoughtful discussion of the topic.  If you like sarcasm, the book is for you.
B000F3T3CS|3.0|I like this performance very much. Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon were really great together. Leo Nucci is really good as Belcore, even though he is a little too old. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo was really great as Dulcamara and a joy to see and hear. Vocally the performance was really great and a joy to hear.    BUT. There are too many times I see very unprofessional behavior from both the leads, especially Anna Netrebko. After Belcore is finishes his entrance aria Netrebko applauds and acts as if she is admiring Leo Nucci and after then return to character. The same is with both of them, especially Netrebko again, when Villazon juggles with balls when he is singing an aria and finishes. Again she applauds. I think that the applauding from the singers on stage when it is not in their character or part of the story is totally unacceptable. There are also times when Netrebko and Villazon are singing a duet that she cannot help but lay her head on his lap even though the character isn't supposed to pay much attention to his affection of her.  This unprofessional behavior is what detracts the two stars. I have the 1964 Figaro performance from Salzburg were the artists take bows after an aria, but that was normal back then. In this day and age is the unprofessionalism displayed by Anna Netrebko unacceptable. Her singing is really exceptional but if she cannot stay in character during a performance  she should stick to concerts or record operas on CD. I am sorry that I feel this and I am probably in the minority, but even Renata Scotto (who was a much bigger star than Netrebko) in her magnificent performance in Luisa Miller from 1979 could stay in character at all times. I hope that this is not a new trend.
0375505091|5.0|You have a great treat ahead of you.<br /><br />If a great portrait photographer can wring powerful meaning from people she barely knows, imagine what she can do with those she knows and loves.  That's the exciting door that Annie Leibovitz opens for us in publishing A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005.  Walk through that door, and you'll never be the same.<br /><br />While there are many wonderful celebrity portraits in the volume, those mostly pale my comparison to the intimate portraits from Ms. Leibovitz's personal life.  In many ways, Ms. Leibovitz's life is both mundane and extraordinary . . . and these images help us see more deeply into both.<br /><br />As she hints in the introduction, Ms. Leibovitz sees each person as small and fleeting in terms of the universe . . . but large and important in terms of the uniqueness of that person and that moment for those whose lives are touched.  The iconic photographs of Susan Sontag dwarfed by the opening to Petra in Jordan and sitting on the Great Pyramid capture this sense beautifully.  But so do photographs of celebrities (like Cindy Crawford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey, and Sylvester Stallone) looking as they never looked before or since.<br /><br />Ms. Leibovitz is unafraid to reveal herself which adds to the dynamic of this book themed around the fleeting nature of human life.  You'll see her partially undraped with camera in hand creating a series of four self portraits.  The serious look in her eyes belies the sensuality of her torso.  Having chosen motherhood in her fifties, you'll also see her fully exposed in her pregnant state in a portrait that echoes the famous magazine cover of a pregnant Demi Moore.<br /><br />More significantly, she reveals the deep caring that she felt for Susan Sontag during their years together before Ms. Sontag succumbed to cancer.  That painful downward path is thoroughly portrayed in rich texture.<br /><br />The same theme of mortality is carried forth in a series of photographs of her parents that culminate in her father's death.  Her mother's decline from a sprightly grandmother into an aging widow is also well documented.<br /><br />Vibrant images of family life, siblings, nieces, and daughters help remind us that life is a never-ending cycle moving forward.  One of my favorites is a landscape view of a roomful of family members celebrating her mother's 80th birthday as her mother takes a photograph of Ms. Leibovitz taking the photograph.<br /><br />This delightful book contains four other elements that are worthy of mention.<br /><br />Ms. Leibovitz is very aware that much of the appearance of celebrities is artifice rather than reality.  She makes that point beautifully in the \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" images of Susan McNamara and Linda Green in Las Vegas in 1995 which show ordinary women transformed into \\"show girls.\\"  Even more eloquently, she captures that artifice in a single photograph of President George W. Bush and his key advisors at the start of his presidency looking like posed characters from a poster for a new move, Conquering Faultless Heroes of the White House.<br /><br />Another astonishing dimension is her ability to render landscapes as God's works of art.  I agree with her assessment that the shooting in Monument Valley didn't turn out all that well, but the other landscapes in the book are terrific . . . if too few in number.  I hope Ms. Leibovitz will do more of this kind of work in the future.<br /><br />She has a strong sense of place to makes these landscapes work.  That same sense works well in her photographs of stunning locations with buildings on them, such as her country home that she developed from a virtual ruin.<br /><br />There's a sense of humor that's remarkable.  Buildings seem to bring it out the best.  The stunning Guggenheim museum in Bilbao is revealed in its mortal roots by a foreground of construction in progress.<br /><br />9/11 also appears in images that capture the emotions we all felt on that day and immediately thereafter.<br /><br />If I had to pick one photograph that best captures the book, it would be the cameo shot of Willie Nelson that highlights his personality and history through his deeply lined face., it would be the cameo shot of Willie Nelson that highlights his personality and history through his deeply lined face.
B000026FOA|5.0|If you ask most of the general public who Nick Drake is about 90-95% won't know who you are talking about. That is because Nick was unknown during his lifetime and today he is still a relatively underground artist. However, all his studio albums are regarded as classics and all three frequently pop up on  lists of great albums.<br /><br />This was the album that started it all, the fascination. His debut album is generally regarded as being less depressing than it's successors. It contains a lot more orchestration and world music influences. Overall, it is a lot more richer in a generical sense.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Time Has Told Me\\", a great little tune, which has some amazing instrumentation and has touches of country music inspiration. The electric guitar part is truly irresistable, while Nick's voice is strangely uplifting. Next is \\"River Man\\", this song is in a rather unusual time signature of 5/4. This gives the song and unorthodox structure. The string section is breathtaking.<br /><br />The next song \\"Three Hours\\" is the first of two songs on the album to feature a slight world music touch courtesy of superb conga work by Rocki Dzidzornu. Following on from that is a song that is widely regarded as one of Nick's best and signature tunes, \\"Way To Blue\\". This song was also  the title of a compilation of Nick's work released posthumously in 1994.<br /><br />\\"Day Is Done\\" continues the rather autumnal, strangely mellow feel of this album. This song along with most in Nick's career features a string section arranged by his good friend Robert Kirby, who has gained fame for his work with Nick. \\"'Cello Song\\" s probably most notable for being featured in \\"The Good Girl\\" a movie starring Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gyllenhaal. It is used in the scene where Jake's character commits suicide. The superb cello work which gives the song its name is also very reminiscent of the cello part in PJ Harvey's song \\"Plants and Rags\\".<br /><br />7 tracks in, \\"The Thoughts Of Mary Jane\\" may be viewed by many to be a reference to the infamous drug marijuana, this may be true as Nick was known to be a recreational marijuana user. \\"Man In A Shed\\" is a beautiful song whose lyrics give a meaning of isolation and seclusion, obviously autobiographical in Nick's case.<br /><br />The final two songs are really great. It starts off with \\"Fruit Tree\\", whose lyrics offer a chilling insight into the mind of this tortured artist. The lyrics to this song have often been used as a template for Nick's life and sometimes to describe his mental state. Finally, \\"Saturday Sun\\" lifts the mood slightly up a bit. This song features Nick on piano and offers a glimpse of what subsequent albums could have been if he lived and experimented with his secondary instrument. Overall it is a beautiful track that has some jazzy bits.<br /><br />In conclusion this album is definitely not as depressing as \\"Pink Moon\\" or as varied as \\"Bryter Layter\\", but it is still a magestic effort nonetheless. Nick is one the few artist whose every song is flawless, and even if he had lived longer subsequent albums would have almost guaranteed to be perfect.\\"The Thoughts Of Mary Jane\\" may be viewed by many to be a reference to the infamous drug marijuana, this may be true as Nick was known to be a recreational marijuana user. \\"Man In A Shed\\" is a beautiful song whose lyrics give a meaning of isolation and seclusion, obviously autobiographical in Nick's case. <br /> <br />The final two songs are really great.

B000001ESN|5.0|These guys were on top of their game during this period. It started around the time of \\"Hemispheres\\" and it peaked during this album. They were extremely proficient with their instruments and as a band by this time. I was 16 when this came out and everyone thought it was the coolest thing. Incredible songwriting, extraordinary instrument playing. Diversified moods and beats on this album from the introspective acoustic \\"Different Strings\\" to heavy riffs in \\"Jacobs Ladder\\" and \\"Natural Science\\" (which deals with microbiology, nature and how we were conceived). Interesting, catchy and heavy rythmn in \\"Entre Nous\\". And of course the highlight: Lee's explosive lead intro and Lifeson's high-energy wailing and wah-wah solo in \\"Freewill\\". (electric rock guitarists were waiting for a solo like this for a LONG time.) Some of the best lyrics from Peart: very deep stuff and phenomenal imagery (ie. \\"Jacobs Ladder\\") - \\"...bruised and sullen storm clouds have the light of day obscured...thunderheads are rumbling in a distant overture\\". Absolutely beautiful and incredible. This album will blow your mind and you will never get tired of this music. These guys worked as one on this recording.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|While I'm not a fan of hip hop/rap, I do give Gwen credit for experimenting in these genres; however, there are only a few of these tracks on the album. The rest of the album is pure, delicious pop at its finest. <br /> <br />1. Wind it Up - Lead single; very catchy/campy <br />2. The Sweet Escape - The album's standout track; contains all of the elements of a #1 pop song <br />3. Orange County Girl - While many view this track as lyrically and musically awful, I'd have to disagree. If you've followed Gwen's career over the years and read a lot of interviews, you'd understand this track. <br />4. Early Winter - Another standout track; great pop/rock ballad circa early U2 <br />5. Now that You Got It - Hated this track at first, but it grew on me. <br />6. 4 in the Morning - Fantastic ballad <br />7. Yummy - You have to hear this one for yourself to make any judgment on it. <br />8. Fluorescent - Another standout; pure 80's pop <br />9. Breakin' Up - Lyrically clever, but not so great. The beginning of the track is hot though. <br />10. Don't Get it Twisted - This track could've easily been on ND's Rock Steady. Great dancehall/synth track. Think \\"In My Head\\" on steroids. <br />11. U Started It - Mediocre track, but Gwen's vocals are their softest and most beautiful on this one. <br />12. Wonderful Life - Awesome, awesome song; track with the most depth; 80's pop/dance
0743298020|3.0|I was very intrigued by the description of this novel and couldn't wait to read it. Like many readers, I particularly enjoy stories about books, authorship, and the literary legacy. I am equally as fascinated by stories of family drama and tragedy, hidden secrets, and scandal. This novel appeared to have it all. However, much like in the novel, appearances are not always what they seem and I was left unsatisfied at the close of the book. <br /> <br />Interestingly, I had a very divided response to the novel. While I was completely drawn in by the story of Vida Winter, her past, and her family, I was utterly annoyed and infuriated by the sections that focused on Margaret, her life, and her experience of trying to unravel the mysteries of Miss Winter's tale and some of the secondary characters related to it.  <br /> <br />First, like a few other reviewers, I had a problem with the too blatant comparisons to some of the great books in English literature - Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, etc. - as well as the mimicry of the gothic romance. I am not opposed to influence, allusion, or reference and am a big fan of all of these writers but I felt that it was too overdone. Coupled with the intermingling of fairytale references, imagery, and archetypes, I sometimes had a hard time taking the \\"present\\" sections seriously. Also, there was something about the tone and voice of these sections - the only way I can describe it is melodramatic or hyperbolic perhaps - that really didn't sit well with me. As a result, I was entirely put off by Margaret's character. Her conflict over her own story only made it worse. And I felt that alot of the scenes involving Margaret and her parents (as well as some other characters) was far too superficially drawn and were devoid of the true human emotion and the subtlety of complex relationships or interactions that would have made her more likable and more real to me and would have ultimately made her story as powerful for the reader as Miss Winter's. In some respects, I wonder if the author had not put the weight of her skill and energies into the creation of Miss Winter's story and neglected Margaret's to a certain extent.  <br /> <br />While Miss Winter's story was not perfectly drawn either and had its flaws, it was far more engaging and well-crafted. I became totally engrossed by the people of Angelfield and the events that occurred to shape the ultimate destruction of the house, literally and figuratively.  Like Margaret, I felt compelled to know the truth of Miss Winter's life and the people of Angelfield and was totally invested in that part of the novel. <br /> <br />That being said, as another reviewer commented the incongruity of who Miss Winter initially revealed she is/was and the person she eventually became was very suspicious and made it apparent that there was some surprise to come. And, although she tells the story of her life through her childhood and reveals perhaps the most significant events of her life, we never learn about how she actually becomes Miss Winter. And while she at one point contests that it is really of no consequence, I think it was wrong of the author to leave the years that follow the story of Angelfield unexplored, even if it had been in some brief way.  <br /> <br />Going along with this, something else that I have to comment on and that goes back to some of my earlier thoughts is the way Miss Winter was initially cast - put in the company of some of the greatest writers - Dickens, Austen, Eliot, etc. I'm not sure how the author could have done it better but I felt like she didn't demonstrate the authenticity of these claims fully enough. Sure she references the wide acclaim that Miss Winter has received - practically every character she comes across has a collection of Miss Winter's books - and makes it clear through the persistent interest in her life by the media. Somehow, I could not buy into this. And when later, there is an opportunity to have a little taste ofMiss Winter's authorship, I was disappointed that it could not finally validate the claims of her supposed literary genius. <br /> <br />Although I know I have probably criticized this book far more than I have praised it, I still encourage people to read it. Despite the many things that I have described as flaws, I still really enjoyed certain elements of it and I know that several of these characters and the story itself with stay with me for a little while. Once I got into it, I could not put it down. In fact, I read the last 200 pages in almost one sitting. To me, all of this confirms that while it may not be a novel to group with the \\"great\\" works of literature, it is absolutely a good read. If you can overlook some of the problems that the overall narrative presents (and if you're not as picky or critical as I am :), I am confident that most readers will walk away from this novel having really enjoyed it. <br />
B0000062S0|2.0|I pulled out this album today and gave it a listen. I remember that I was so excited to hear these guys creating new music that I got the Japan version of this CD three weeks before this album came out in the US. I love these guys for the wonderful music they have created over the years but this album is the rarest exception. The first two songs are great and the next two are quite good. Blue Train has a disjointed yet very beautiful solo by Page which highlights the album for me. Pure Page at his best. However this is where it ends for me as the rest of the album is a true bore. Plant sounds tired and Page is just going through the motions. Most High sounds pedestrian and Heart in your Hand sounds like Dick Dale gone wrong. Finally asking Steve Albini to mix this album resulted in a distorted mess of sound. The vocals are hissy and you can't hear that beautiful acoustic guitar on the opening track. I have bootlegs that sound better than this album. In conclusion this a valliant but ultimately disapointing album from two men who have brought so much joy to my life. Robert's latest album is fantastic and I know we haven't heard the last from Page.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|this is probably the best Christmas CD ever!  I never really buy Christmas CD's, but I have been a Sarah McLachlan fan for years, so I couldn't resist.  This CD is beautiful and illustrates a more nostalgic and melancholy Christmas sentiment.  I'm glad that it contains none of the phony Christmas happiness that so many crappy Christmas songs have tried to convey.
0618680004|5.0|'The God Delusion' is the most provocative book this science novice has ever read. PROVOCATIVE is defined in Websters as: 'serving or tending to stimulate'.  Mental stimulation seems to be Dawkins' aim, but this is as much a history book as a philosophical endeavor.<br /><br />RD describes the path humans have followed and the role that religion has played.  He admits to the fact that religion possibly DID aid in our evolutionary 'progress.' The role religion plays is treated fairly.  He may not look favorably upon it in most cases, but the criticism never seems unfair.<br /><br />Humor can be used in writing about/discussing religion.  RD displays a British wit that this Yank has always been a fan of.  There is a great deal of comedy in this book.  I wouldn't describe it as laugh-out-loud funny, but I was smiling throughout.<br /><br />This preeminent evolutionary scientist, displays a skillful use and high regard for the written word. His use of analogy is unlike anything I've read in the field of science.  RD understands the discomfort often felt in the religion/science debate.  He not only explains the origin of that discomfort, but shows us how it's part of the learning process.
B00004T0P1|5.0|This is an incredible score! Not only is this one of the best animated scores ever, it's also one of James Newton Howard's greatest works as a composer. Every que is composed with absolute authority and perfection. I think one of the main reasons I liked this score so much was that it didn't cater to \\"cute\\" or \\"disney.\\" Much like JNH's \\"Signs\\" or \\"The Village\\" we get plenty of suspense, hard hitting action, and tracks that show true emotion.  <br /> <br />Overall, if you are a fan of JNH like me, you can't be without this score.
B000000OQ5|5.0|I'm so excited in writing this review, more than twenty years after I did buy this album. I'm excited in writing the review for Mechanical Resonance, MECHANICAL RESONANCE, which to me is like a picture from my youth, a smell from my youth, ... it is like having again the taste of the first kiss I had in my life.  MECHANICAL RESONANCE GUYS!!!!! I remember quite clearly those days, when this album came out. Instead I can't remember how many times I have listened to this one. A billion maybe! It is the soundtrack of my teen age years! This album is just one of those albums that sign a time. It is simply perfect, one note after the other, one riff after the other, one song after the other, nothing is out of place here. This album is perfection in this style. Few albums in this style we love, rock, hard rock, metal, hair metal whatever you may call this, can match this perfection. But Mechanical Resonance is up there with the best of them in the very first positions. It was a shot in the dark to me! I will never forget the first listenings! I remember quite well I immediatly thought ... Wow this is unbelievable! Mechanical Resonance, yes, is perfect. It is the \\"Kind of blue\\" of rock 'n' roll, modern hard rock I might call this. Rock with chops, more chops than the Zep or Aerosmith. It was rock 'n' roll in the era of guitar heroes when the competition in guitar was very high. The guys from Tesla won that contest through a kind of Van Halen guitar style taking back to the simple and no frills rock'n' roll. This is the album to have from those years. From any era if you want a rock album that will shake your walls and delight your ears. It will never sound dated because it is simple and sophisticated, hard and tender, anthemic and brilliant. It has that special quality of the things that you know from the very first time you listen to them, that will last. It is a perfect example of what rock should be about. No frills, great chops, great energy, simple but catchy songwriting, extremely clever arrangements, and that special sense of modernity that will never fade away in a thousand years from now. There are wonderful ballads like We're no good together, phenomenal country rock songs like Little Suzi, incredible rock anthems like Ez come Ez go, or Comin atcha live, Cover Queen. I mean. It is perfect. It is FOR SURE one of the albums I love the most FROM ANY ERA. Neither Tesla ever reached this level. Some people say The great radio controversy is better. I don't agree. \\"Radio\\" is a good album, but Mechanical Resonance is PERFECTION. Everything is perfect in this album, even the cover which exactly speaks for the music. A shot of fire, the warmth of the tubes, an electric meltdown that was going to shake the world. And it did!!!!! Lights and thunder guys, close your eyes and listen here it is one the best rock albums ever made, MECHANICAL RESONANCE!!!!!!!!!ng, extremely clever arrangements, and that special sense of modernity that will never fade away in a thousand years from now.

B000000OEI|5.0|Ok, so I've been collecting Zimmer and countless other classical-film score composers since I was 8. This is definately one of Zimmer's defining momtents as a composer. The themes and orchestrations presented here are just mind blowing, and totally great.  <br /> <br />Buy if you are a fan of Zimmer, or muscular score music.
0684857219|4.0|I have spent hundreds of hours poring over this book. This book was my guide to starting bodybuilding this summer and spent the entire summer reading and learning from this book. I really do like this book, but it does have a few problems which I will discuss. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the personal way that Arnold writes. It is not at all like reading a textbook. He covers a vast amount of information, but it is very readable and mostly easy to understand. He talks about more than muscles, also the psychology and mind aspect of the sport, which is really appreciated since working out intensely can be so demanding. <br /> <br />The exercises are described by Arnold, but the pictures shown of the corresponding exercises sometimes show them doing the exercises differently, which is just not good when you are trying to learn to do them the way Arnold says to and the pictures don't match the description. For example, the grip he describes for certain exercises are shown with the bodybuilders holding the bar differently than he says to. <br /> <br />I would have loved if Arnold was more specific on the amount of reps/sets to do for the body parts in his workout plans which begin on page 180. He mentions only a few recommendations (like 5 sets of 15 reps for calves), but curiously this is not found for most of the exercises. He does make general recommendations such as 4 sets per exercise, but this is not given the amount of attention or specifity to your fitness level that it needs to have. It is also confusing when he mentions how many sets HE did for certain exercises, (like squats) and they are WAY higher than what he recommends. I realize his fitness level at the time was amazing, but he needs to give more recommendations for beginners and intermediate bodybuilders. <br /> <br />I would also say that I believe the beginning workouts he recommends starts a person out on a VERY strict program that is extremely difficult for a beginner to follow. It is a six-day a week program, and how many people can work out for six days a week? It is a challenge for me to even get four days a week in at times. What has worked for me since I had to devise a different strategy because Arnold's was way too intense, was working the major muscles (chest, back, quads, and shoulders) once a week on a different day, and the smaller muscles (biceps, triceps, calves, hamstrings)twice a week. <br /> <br />Also, the book falls apart easily due to its thick size and paperback binding. I have pages falling out every time I read it.  <br /> <br />Overall, it is a good reference and contains great tips about bodybuilding, but if you are just starting out, I would recommend getting another book which shows the correct photos which correspond to the pictures, and has better recommendations for sets/reps for beginners. I would say the book has the detailed explanation which is excellent for going more in depth if you are interested, but is a lot of information for beginners to digest, so unless you have lots of time to devote to this book, get another book to start out with and get this one later or in addition to your other book when you are ready to become more serious about it. It is extremely valuable if you do have the time to learn from it, but beware of the problems I mentioned above. <br />
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins' thinking on religion mirrors my own.  It was refreshing to discover that I am not alone in failing to see the deity's-new-clothes that are apparently so obvious to many people throughout the world (it's odd that with so many supposedly looking at the same thing their descriptions are wildly different). In addition Dawkins explains and demolishes many of the slight-of-tongue techniques used by religions to justify themselves.   <br /> <br />Nonbelievers and agnostics will probably get the most out of this book.  Brave-hearted believers may also find it interesting but the weak-faithed should read it only at the peril of their faith.
0440213525|3.0|I actually enjoyed the book so much at the beginning, and thought it would get even more interesting and was so excited that I was unfolding the events one by one. But, unfortunately, when I read almost two third of the book, I was gradually losing my interest and desire to carefully read it and finally, I found myself just skimming the book real quickly.. This story grabbed my attention at the beginning but as it continued to develop the plot, it became quite boring because this story was totally unrealistic. yes, it is fiction but there are too many coincidences and too much luck for the kid. the lawyer, judge, and all other minor characters surrounding the kid, they're are quite nonsense and that's why i am giving only 3 stars.
B000E5N62U|5.0|\\"The Modern Classic\\" is a phrase applied to any number marketed goods; it is a combination of words describing something's timelessness regardless of its being contemporary, and therefore, still facing the trials of time.  Dubbing items a \\"modern classic\\" is a process that should be sparse in its applicaton, however you are likely to see this accolade placed on any number of undeserving products.<br /><br />And then there is this number; Donald Fagen, universal master of the cool, releasing a solo album for the 21st Century.  Now that the age of irony has come and (possibly) gone this album cannot be so easily branded a dinosaur rocker's output nor can it be upheld as the works of a prolific genius.  The bar for what makes an album a classic one becomes increasingly high as the current milieu of comparable musical output is decreasingly low.  \\"Morph the Cat\\", however, has all the markings of The Modern Classic in any number of criteria for the title.  It is a new album that stands out as far superior the it's contemporaries, it exhibits a form that is indicative of classic, and, in additon, it catches an aesthetic of American music and imagery that can be suitably correllated to the American classic period.<br /><br />A respected source for musical journalism recently referred to Gwen Stefani as the \\"boldest\\" pop star in a review of her latest recording.  Granted, when you listen to today's top 40, Gwendolyn might stick out a little for her boisterouness or \\"experimental\\" (in the most explicitly populist ways) production technique, but other than that her iconoclasm in pop standards is restricted.  But this example is not to cast aspersions on Miss Stefani, rather it is to show the liberality with which mundane musicians are overly praised.  And here we have Mr. Fagen and \\"Morph the Cat\\"; the same unnamed music journalism source dogged Steely Dan's grammy winning \\"Two Against Nature\\" as a poor throwback album.  I hope they were merely pitching a fork, because if they are not, than they have been duped into an existance of appreciation for sub-par performances.<br /><br />\\"Morph the Cat\\" may not feature minimalist dance beats made on Pro-Tools nor will you find him tinkering with time signatures in an oh-so archaic plee of \\"Look at me, I'm innovative\\".  No, Fagen here is working with a standard formula, but in doing so is standing out.  Perhaps the most innovative action in todays blase field is to actually work on harnessing and perfecting a technique, which is what Fagen has dedicated a long career to.  Some accredit the abandonment of traditional form to a need to constantly evolve; I accredit it to laziness on the part of upcomers more obsessed with what they, rather than their music, represent.  On \\"What I Do\\" we find a nice little R&B number that is a dialogue between a young Donald Fagen and Ray Charles.  It is a fitting ode as the album is steeped in the bewilderment of real rock 'n' roll.  Donald Fagen is not a sentimental crooner, he is a salty piano-bar lamenter.  Its a metaphor lost on the i-Pod generation, and thank god for that.  On \\"Morph the Cat\\" Fagen rises above both the youthful musicians of the trendy scenes and the peers of his era who have fallen the way of telathons and piss poor duet albums.<br /><br />As an album The Cat shows the craftwork of a true artist.  A concept album about an amorphous cat-like blob that personifies New York city, it is pieced together in a way that few albums can match.  Opening with a strutting bassline on the title track that immediately brings to mind urban hustle, it makes for an experience in music that can really encapsulate the listener.  The title track and the ending and knot-tying reprise frame an album that is variegated in its characteristics.  There is a little funk in \\"White Night Gown\\", some ballad in \\"Great Pagoda of Fun\\", and a lot of Steely Dan-ness in \\"Security Joan\\".  The listener is introduced to characters who must be presented under different tones, and Fagen does so perfectly.  The weaving jazz that underlies all of the pop and songyness is an extra layer of music that puts a setting to the person and the situation.<br /><br />Craft is a word that cannot be over-stressed in describing \\"Morph the Cat\\".  All who are familiar with Fagen technique should not be surprised by the obsessive attention paid to every delicate detal.  Every little nuance is perfectly placed on the canvas.  The shimmering chimes in the back of \\"Pagoda of Fun\\", the rising and falling scales of \\"Night Belongs to Joan\\", and the incomplete solos quietly backing the title track were all well thought out even though they appear as mere afterthoughts.  The complete picture of this album is one ascribing to the benefits of craft, intelligence, and contemplation.<br /><br />\\"Morph the Cat\\" is traditional even for a Fagen outing.  Compared to '93's \\"Kamakiriad\\" it is much more rooted in traditional blues and jazz than the funk and slick-modern chill of that album. As a concept album about the Big Apple its form and content could not be more appropriate.  There is no better way to capture the aesthetic quality of the conceptual City That Never Sleeps than by appealing to its most classic era.  On \\"Morph the Cat\\" we really get the Rockafeller out of Rockafeller Center, the shake of the speakeasy is sensually close, and we all feel the adventure of the mammoth structure of tommorows city being erected.  It transcends mere quality critiques when you begin to feel the classique with which it was constructed.  No, I can't say this album captures the classic aesthetics of antiquity, but it does harken to Americas comparable period.  It is great modern music that pays tribute to our vivacious past.<br /><br />And so it should be taken that \\"Morph the Cat\\" is the modern classic not because alot of people will like it and remember it, but because it lives up to what it truly means to be a classic.  Fagen has produced a magnum piece of music among a landscape of what is less than mediocre.  The album is wrought with all the qualities of what it means to be an album and is a testament to producing good music centered around good ideas.  \\"Morph the Cat\\" is a true piece of iconolast work because it tears down that highly praised tradition of futile evolution in a musicians sound.  Sure, Donald shows he can evolve, but he doesn't do so by tying a bunch of slick (or sloppy) bells and whistles to his material, he does it by making it the best it can be.ving jazz that underlies all of the pop and songyness is an extra layer of music that puts a setting to the person and the situation.

B00003ZKS1|5.0|MSG is the first album after he left UFO and it's a<br /><br />rock classic. The songwriting and guitar work is just<br /><br />brilliant and is as good as UFO's No Place to Run<br /><br />released the same year. Both groups continued on even<br /><br />though many UFO fans were not happy at the time. Songs<br /><br />like Armed n'Ready, Cry for the Nations, Looking out<br /><br />From Nowhere and the overlooked \\"Feels like a Good Thing\\"<br /><br />are as good as anything he made with UFO. Now at the time<br /><br />I wasn't happy with Gary Barden's vocals as he was no<br /><br />Phil Moog but after time he did fit very well with the<br /><br />harder rock songs MSG made at the time and the 2nd album<br /><br />is just brilliant and should've sold millions but.....<br /><br />If you overlooked this at the time you need to get it!
B000J103OI|4.0|First of all this has to be one of the best titles for a book and subsequently this movie, and it fit's the great Steep, who channels Ms. Wintour.  I cannot think of any actress better for this part, she owns this movie and is frankly the main reason to see it.  The book was  a fun, quick read, and the movie is fun, but the story light and meandering, like the book..Hathaway does not get in the way and she's good in the role, the movies cameo's are good as well, but again its Streep, that makes this movie.

It even features a lighted page.<br /><br />It's an incredible piece of art.  A great Christmas/Winter Holiday gift to people of all ages.
B000FGGE5Y|4.0|Now wouldn't that be a cool thing to have (flat space technology)?  Although they don't explain what happens to the mass.  Apparently it handles that as well or Violet wouldn't have been able to stand. <br /> <br />If you like or don't mind comic book type adventure movies, then I think it was somewhere between okay and good.  I actually watched it, watched it with the Milla Jovovich commentary on and then re-watched several scenes. <br /> <br />I kept hearing it was a weak immitation of Aeon Flux, but I actually liked it more than Aeon Flux.   <br /> <br />Milla Jovovich is very hot and fun to watch.  Plenty of Hong Kong style action.  If you like that stuff and go in expecting that, you might like it.  Maybe it's just one of my guilty pleasures, but I liked it.
B000002WFF|5.0|During 1970, Elvis began to enjoy the fame that by that time had begun to dwindle. The 60's were somewhat unkind to him and although he still had some of his appeal musically, his films were pulling him under. This is just my opinion, but it is probably well known that the movies and their soundtracks were tepid at best. <br />This album is another favorite of mine because it allows Elvis to be the real Elvis. After he returned to the stage he OWNED the stage. That was his domain and he gave the audience the results of his revived hunger to be the best. I enjoy all of the songs on this album, but I'll pick out a couple of favorites.  <br />I've Lost You is just one of those songs that is simple, but just about says it all about the ebb and flow of relationships. <br />Mary In The Morning is an excellent, excellent love song. I recently heard an acoustic version on YouTube with photos in a slide format. I wish that I could find this acoustic version on an album because Elvis' voice is outstanding. Sometimes I wish that Felton and RCA had not buried his vocals underneath the orchestra and backup singers. Mary In The Morning is one of those songs that never has received the airplay that it deserves. <br />I now have the TTWII boxed set which is a definite MUST-HAVE for Elvis fans and should be listened to by those who snicker at the name  <br />ELVIS PRESLEY.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|If you're looking for the old flamboyant Crockett and Tubs and the drug money super cool Miami Vice the television series, this movie isn't that.    But this isn't the 1980's and these characters and the feel of this movie are more in line with the 2000's.    Like the movie Collateral, Michael Mann filmed this movie so everything looks crisp and sharp, even the night scenes (in his commentaries he says HD makes that possible).  The sky looks bluer and than blue and it seems like you can see forever.  He still has that knack for filming in amazing locations that are a treat to look at.  Also like Collateral, it's obvious the leads in this movie trained quite a bit so their weapons handling looked realistic.    It had a lot of great speed boat, aircraft and car scenes.  And I really liked the last 15 minutes (I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that).    As long as you don't expect the 80's Miami Vice and you expect something re-tuned for the 2000's you may like it.  I did.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|Wow!  I must say that I'm pretty disappointed in how dramatic and harsh some people on here are being in their reviews!  While I am not entirely satisfied by this album, I would definitely not go so far as to give it 1 star or to say that I have lost all respect for Gwen Stefani!  Now that I've gotten that off my chest.... <br /> <br />Over the years, Gwen Stefani has proven to be a very special gift to the music community.  No Doubt should probably go down in history as one of the most underrated bands of our time, as their work was almost always stunning.  As a solo artist, Gwen not only constructed a surprisingly complex and substance-filled \\"pure pop\\" album, but also contributed something very special as a collaborator on Eve's \\"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\\" and Moby's \\"South Side\\".  On top of it all, she has always proven to be an incredibly grounded person (especially for a celebrity).  Gwen is never getting in catfights with other celebrities, her work, family, and friends are always her focus, and she has always made it evident that she never takes her career for granted.  Clearly, we are dealing with a very smart woman, here. <br /> <br />I must admit that upon first hearing that Gwen wanted to make an album that contained many songs that were \\"left over\\" from her first solo album, I began to panic.  While I have always been able to count on Gwen to put together great music, I was nervous that this album was being thrown onto the market just to keep Gwen on the radio for a massive length of time.  Thankfully, it doesn't seem that this was the motivation, after all.  The Sweet Escape is probably one of the most abstract albums in \\"pop music\\" available right now.  While tracks like \\"The Sweet Escape\\", \\"Early Winter\\", \\"4 in the Morning\\", and \\"Wonderful Life\\" are very accessible, tracks such as \\"Wind It Up\\", \\"Orange County Girl\\", \\"Yummy\\" and \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\" are highly experimental, as Gwen uses her voice in sometimes very strange ways, the lyrics are either absurd or wittily playful, and the background music is anything but mainstream. <br /> <br />Sometimes this works, and sometimes it doesn't.  As with the experimental \\"classical\\" music of Phillip Glass, there is a fine line between *music* and *noise*.  My main complaints with Gwen's new album lie within the lyrical content and sometimes-too-boundary-pushing track choices.  For example, while I love the Sound of Music integration in \\"Wind it Up\\", the song obviously fails in its mission to be club-worthy.  Gwen goes so far as to say that \\"this beat is for the clubs\\", but The Neptunes' background music hardly displays anything that suggests \\"a beat\\", by club standards.  While it is certainly different and bold, the production simply does not work.  Lyrically, there are some problems with accessibility and with rationality.  For example, \\"Orange County Girl\\" is a song that really only applies to Gwen.  People who listen to the song are not going to be able to empathize at all with the lyrics because they are specifically about Gwen's career and such.  Also, the \\"all my girls [or boys] sing - la la la la la la la la\\" sections seem lazily thrown on to fill space, and the \\"on and on and on and on\\" sections really DO go on and on (and that's not a good thing). <br /> <br />On the other hand, there are many ways this album shines.  In some places, the experimental approach truly does succeed.  Also, when Gwen is actually singing like we know her to, she puts some of her best work down, yet.  I am particularly impressed with the bridge section in \\"Early Winter\\", for example.  The part where she uses melisma on the word \\"why\\" to trace out a triad over gorgeous accompaniment is probably one of the most brilliant things I have heard in a long time, and yet it is so simplistic. <br /> <br />While this album is not as solid as her previous one, I am proud of Gwen for being bold enough to take the risks she does.  Hopefully, her future work--whether it be a new album with No Doubt or athird solo album--will be all the better for having made some creative missteps.  Regardless, I would say that this album is very worth buying for those who want to be taken outside of the box.

B000E97HIA|3.0|I truly wonder how and why R&B singer Prince has managed to establish a career that has influenced a multitude of artists for more than 30 entire years. It's not his capabilities as an artist that has me questioning his longevity - his soulful, powerful, occasionally smooth vocals are nothing short of ace, his abilities as a musician are incredible and the 16-bar rapping skills he displays on \\"Incense & Candles\\", one of the album's many raunchy slow jams, are surprisingly impressive. What I consider to be the fundamental flaw of Prince's latest album, \\"3121\\", is its severe lack of subject matter. Perhaps I missed a moment in Prince's career where he toned down his overt misogyny in favour of more thought-provoking or contemplative music, but \\"3121\\" is another classic example of Prince's undying obsession with sex. Thankfully, his music isn't as grotesque as his provocative, overly revealing, disgusting, pornographic pictures and cover arts. <br /> <br />As a reminder, do take note that I'm criticizing his subject matter, NOT his songwriting ability. He's more than capable of writing strong lyrics - a fact that is best displayed on \\"Fury\\", a thrilling slice of R&B/Funk/Rock where Prince manically wails \\"there ain't no fury like a woman's scorn\\" over bombastic horns and chunky electric guitar riffs. On \\"The Dance\\", Prince shows unusual shades of vulnerability over smooth piano/violin production, right before concluding it with the type of uncontrollably insane shouting and screaming that'd make Beyonce & Kelis look tame. Then there's the uplifting \\"Beautiful, Loved & Blessed\\", a beautifully crafted R&B/Soul duet ballad between Prince and R&B songstress/Prince protégé Tamar Davis (by the way, Tamar Davis makes multiple background vocal contributions on many of the tracks on this album).  <br /> <br />Apart from those tracks, the rest of the songs on \\"3121\\" are self-indulgent odes to sex! That's what Prince essentially seems to be about - he's more concerned with making love with you than being in love with you. Even when he's suavely cooing romantic poetry on the gorgeous Latin R&B/Pop ballad \\"Te Amo Corazon\\", he's keeping in mind that seduction is his main focus. Even if these songs fail miserably when judged by their originality or lyrics, they all make for enjoyable listening on a sonic level. The minimalist-synth-driven \\"Black Sweat\\", the percussion-driven/vocal-effects-heavy title track and the Funk-infused raunchiness of \\"Lolita\\" & \\"Get On The Boat\\" best exemplify the aforementioned fact that this album, despite its lack of substance, can be a sonically enjoyable listen. <br /> <br />This album definitely isn't worthy of a 5 because there's not enough substance, but it doesn't deserve a 1 because Prince's talents as a singer and musician are excellently displayed throughout the album's dozen tracks. Since the sound is worthy of a 5 and the subject matter is worthy of a 2 (both out of 5), I'll have to settle for a 3.5 stars. <br /> <br />5 Best Tracks: <br />\\"Fury\\" <br />\\"Beautiful, Loved & Blessed (feat. Tamar Davis)\\" <br />\\"Incense & Candles\\" <br />\\"The Dance\\" <br />\\"Black Sweat\\"
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I was all set not to like this movie because critics loved it so much and I usually completely disagree with them. <br /> <br />I thought the characters had a certain chemistry and although I was never a fan of Jake Gyllenhal (thought he was a shallow teeny-bopper type actor) he did a very, very good job of aging from 19 to 39. I never saw a movie with Heath Ledger either. I thought he did an excellent job as a man in great conflict with his bi-sexual desires which were a death sentence in the early 60's. Also as with other reviewers, the problem with Ledger was that I could NOT UNDERSTAND 80% OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING! He seemed to be channeling Tommy Lee Jones' voice. <br /> <br />SPOILER ALERT:  <br /> <br />Several things were not clear. <br />1. Did Ennis's wife ever fully come out and tell him she knew of his relation with Jack? <br /> <br />2. Did Jack's wife know how he really died? Or was the flat tire accident just a cover-up for the good of the family so there would not be a scandal ? <br /> <br />3. Were Jack's ashes in the paper bag with the shirt his mom gave Ennis? Did Ennis take them to Brokeback Mountain? <br /> <br />4. Heath Ledger mumbles. Does anyone know what he said at the end of the movie to Jack's shirt? <br /> <br />I would give this movie a 5 having been compelled to watch it so many times. I give it a 4 for unanswered questions and the difficulty in understanding Ennis's dialogue. <br />
B00005JOFQ|3.0|I thought this movie was missing something. I liked the concept, I liked the setting and I liked the love scenes. Something about this movie though seemed to fall flat. The acting was wooden and the emotions seemed fake. It wasn't really a great love story and seemed to lack real passion. After the first time, all of their meetings seemed painful, unsatisfying and not worth the effort. The overall tone of the movie was moody and I found the ending a little anti-climactic. I really respect the fact that writers and studios are getting brave enough to branch out and make movies about taboo subjects like this. It was a good effort but not a great movie. It wasn't terrible, it just left me feeling empty. It's kind of a depressing storyline with not a lot of happy moments, just a lot of pain, drama and problems. There seemed to be little chemistry between the two actors. Let me just say, I have no problem with people being gay and I would have felt the same way if this was a heterosexual story! There just were no sparks, and the movie came off as cold or lukewarm at best.
B000G759LW|5.0|I did not start out liking Christina Aguilera, but have grown to really appreciate her as an artist. I admire the fact that she is not afraid to try new things. I believe that any artist who does not venture outside the comfort zone will not last long; as the world is full of one hit wonders. I also admire the fact that she produces and writes her own material, something many bubble gum princesses do not do. <br />This album was addictive. I enjoyed CD 1 which samples classics by Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight. Her voice is clear, strong, and vibrant. I enjoyed the tracks and have listened to this first CD many times over, and am constantly finding new and interesting aspects of it. I was only disappointed with \\"Thank You\\" which I found schmaltzy. <br />CD 2 is a wonderful departure from the norm for Christina's previous albums. I enjoyed this for the various styles covered. <br />\\"Candy Man\\" reminded me of The Andrew Sisters, yet with Christina's \\"dirty\\" spin.  <br />\\"I Got Trouble\\" was an interesting exercise is production methods. I enjoyed the old scratchy record quality to the song. It reminds me of Billie Holiday.  <br />This is the type of CD that you'll listen to from start to finish, and love it!

6304806418|5.0|Evita is a real throwback to 60s epic filmmaking, an incredibly spectacular adaptation that manages to be both stylised and still look authentic thanks to Alan Parker's excellent direction and Darius Khondji's striking Scope imagery that makes good use of the many lavish crowd scenes. The score is surprisingly good - just as well, since the movie is a virtual rock opera - and Antonio Banderas is a commanding and convincing enough musical presence to make you wonder what the Hell Andrew Lloyd Webber was thinking of dropping him from The Phantom of the Opera for the plank-like, flat-voiced but presumably much cheaper Gerard Butler. Madonna brings the required ruthless iconic status although her voice isn't always up to the demands of the part (she is especially flat when hitting the low notes and her rendition of Don't Cry For Me, Argentina lacks real power) and she's not much good at doing the tango, while the addition of a new song drags out the ending more than is necessary, but it's still the best movie musical in decades. The fact that Lloyd Webber hates it only adds to its appeal. And just think how bad it could have been had the Oliver Stone-Meryl Streep version got off the ground!
B0000024ZC|4.0|Giant's third studio album, released in 1972, is a story about three schoolmates whom over time (for whatever reasons) lose contact with each other and how their individual lives turned out - a laborer, artist, and rich dude. It is a story about life, and the music is overflowing with creative arranging, writing, solid melodies, and unique multilayered vocal harmonies.     The order of the songs and lyrics flow like chapters in a book beginning with \\"Prologue\\" a bouncy tune with great musical interplay. \\"Schooldays\\" highlights stellar vibe and bass playing that blasts into a short jazzy jam towards the end of the song. The sax and bass playing the same notes in unison during the verse while the keyboards and guitar hammer out offbeat rhythms on \\"Working All Day\\" creates a full sound. \\"Peel the Paint\\" starts out quiet but transforms into a hard rocking tune with an unexpected but tasty guitar/drum break. \\"Mister Class and Quality?\\" is toe tapping groove-oriented song with great solo work that segues into the mid tempo title track which closes out the disc.     \\"Three Friends\\" lasts a little over 35 minutes, but there is zero filler and it flows so well that I would recommend this to any music fan. Most definitely, a timeless disc that still sounds fresh, groundbreaking, and original.
B00001OH7P|5.0|In the fall of 1972, while I was still listening to The Eagles, Leon Russel, and Carole King, along came David Bowie and \\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust\\".  I had never heard anything like this album before, or since.  Ziggy Stardust fell to earth right into the faces of all those hippy songwriters and folk-rock singers with a brand new sound full of subtle and not so subtle sexual innuendo.  David Bowie started Glamour Rock before there was even a term for it.  I just knew this music was way ahead of it's time and very cool to listen to.  Many albums have two hits or so and the rest filler songs.  The Rise and Fall Of Ziggy Stardust is all great.  The only odd song is \\"It ain't easy\\" and that one just didn't make the final cut of Bowie's previous \\"Hunky Dory\\" album.  The jazz-to-ballad-to-throbbing-rock was/is an icredible listen.  Mick Ronson's guitar snarls, stings, bites, and even when in the background, sharply nibbles away. David Bowies's singular voice is often accompanied by strange and haunting background vocals by the \\"Spiders from Mars\\".  Add strings, synthesizer, and other sounds I can't identify and the music sometimes starts drifitng into dreamlike space.  Then the steady line of the base guitar keeps most of the songs centered while other cuts must be riveted back down to earth by the strong, often pounding piano work.  The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust is an incredidle album.  After almost thirty-five years, this one is still my favorite David Bowie album, and in my opinion, his masterpiece.
B000JJRIO8|2.0|Pac would record extra songs to vent his frustrations and get whatever he had off his chest. He never meant for these recordings to be released as he didn't see them as his \\"A\\" material. His mother is continuing to explot her son's considerable name at the expense of the quality of the music. Pairing him up with ppl who aren't good enuff to tie his shoes, let alone rap w/ him is a shame and a disgrace. These albums showcase the greed of Afeni Shakur, not the talent of her son.
6305313687|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I feel Edward Norton is one of the best actors around.  I can't pretend that I am following his acting career or anyone else's for that matter, but every thing I see him in has been challenging to say the least and he performs to unbelieveable standards.  This is no different for sure - so I was bound to like it just because the acting is so good.    This is not a happy story and if you are looking for anything like that, you have come to the wrong place.  But this is compelling and if you find it interesting to see how other people live, this is a great movie to see.  I would caution parents against allowing (please forgive me for this) \\"youthful and rebellious\\" teens from seeing this as they may miss the point at the end.
0881032646|4.0|\\"There has been nothing like it for years . . . an author who understands there may be things that have a higher claim on humanity than its own 'survival'.\\"  C S Lewis<br /><br />*<br /><br />I have two observations.<br /><br />First, it is a tribute to Clarke's talent that he took what might have been short story with a \\"gag\\" ending to a thought-provoking novel that caught the attention of C. S. Lewis.<br /><br />Second, if you replace the Overlords with black monoliths, you have \\"2001.\\"<br /><br />For me, this story took two reading a year apart to sink in.  The \\"gag\\" worked on me, and had a deeper impact than the \\"V\\" miniseries.  But the story does not stop there, and takes us to another level.  There are a lot of thought-points, and even though humanity moves on, I was still left with a twinge of sadness for the Overlords.<br /><br />As a Christian I was not bothered by the \\"gag\\" associated with the Overlord's appearance.  What puzzled me, however, is that Clarke is telling aspects of the Christian's story:  The Overlords are guardian angels (devils are fallen angels who cannot progress), placed here by the Overmind (Logos=\\"Rational communication,\\" God=\\"Supreme Intelligence, Omniscient\\"), to uplift man to their full potential (Athanasius: \\"God became man, so that man might be god.\\")  The only difference is that there is no mention of red-handed sin, just faults in behavior.  Also, the Overlords do act as mediators, eventhough they do not atone.<br /><br />The other aspect that I would have like to see elaborated upon is the reaction of Islamofascists to the Overlords.  Of course, this is a weakness to all pre-9/11 literature, but I can't help thinking about how the Overlords would have reacted to suicide bombers, etc.  Clarke mentions an ecumenical document (page 9).  This is believable for the more moderate and liberal factions of religions in general, but I could not see such a thing happen with the violent extremists that inhabit all movements, spiritual or secular.<br /><br />I have a redacted version, and am curious how the pre-1990m opening read.  It would be nice if future editions had the original opening as an appendix. This should keep purists and fans of retro-future like me happy.  I am not bothered by anachronisms in gold age sci-fi--2001, The Martian Chronicles, Space Cadet, and this book. In fact, I find the eager naivety energizing.

B00004R9A4|5.0|What I love most about these classics from my childhood is that having spent numerous years not watching them, you have children of your own and you out them on and its still fresh.  You understand the time/place contexts better after some education, you appreciate the actors more, whatever.  And yet you didn't need all of that the first time, just like your kids don't while you've got them sitting in front of the tv on a cold and stormy night instead of running through the house screaming and driving you insane when all you are trying to do is get some housework done.  I think you get my point on this...  Kids like it, and if you don't know the movie already, you'll probably find yourself enjoying it as well!

B000HEWEJO|5.0|I find it hard to believe that there are people out there that have not seen this, but that may be the case I suppose.  If you have never seen this and you want a classic holiday movie, you could do a lot worse than this one.  The story line and values may be outdated, but there are many movies out there that people outright morally disagree with.  This is quaint, cute and leaves me at least with a nice happy feeling about being able to make a difference in the world.
0553375636|5.0|\\"The Farseer:  Royal Assassin\\" continues \\"The Farseer Trilogy\\" as FitzChivalry explains his activities using his developing skills as an assassin and in both the Skill and Wit from a first person point of view.  Being educated and working alongside the master assassin uncovers more insight into Chade's past.<br /><br />King Shrewd entrusts political assignments similar to the stereotypical mobster, in a subtle and (resembling his namesake) shrewd fashion asking for resolutions to specific dilemmas.  Assassinations can be avoided also with the proper advice or suitable scheme.  In the meantime FitzChivalry struggles with his emotions towards childhood friend Molly.  Chade, Burrich, and the King's Fool remain refreshing support characters in addition to the unexpected King-in-Waiting Verity.  Wide ranges of female characters interact but without the braid tugging or whining found in other series.  A couple exciting events at sea and a powerful scene at a funeral pyre identify the amazing talent of the author.<br /><br />The creative plot becomes darker when Red-Ship Raiders and resulting Forged ones generate difficulties by becoming more aggressive during periods of internal strife.  Strangely FitzChivalry does not intuitively observe his surrounding and solve problems like in the previous novel.  Nevertheless, the book has an intense and unanticipated end.<br /><br />The storyline for the most part presents respectable affection between individuals and animals but maintains the cunning of politics to be acceptable for young readers.  The many people can be confusing with the odd names.  A more detailed map of the significant terrains and comprehensive appendix would have been useful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.

0393324818|5.0|I used to wonder how it was that Billy Beane is such a great manager or coach or whatever he is and now I know why: communications skills. Beane is not only baseball-smart, he's book-smart. And not just \\"I read a book once\\" smart either. This is one of the few men in any field smart enough to write a book without the help of a ghost writer.<br /><br />This is no faint praise. Throughout the book you will learn about such true-life travails and characters as Jeremy Brown, the catcher drafted in the 16th round because the Oakland A's value fatness in their backstops, or Paul DePodesta, who went on after this book was written to get fired by no greater team than the Los Angeles Dodgers (no, not the one with both the Los Angeles and the Anaheim in their name, the ones who actually play in Los Angeles). Beane himself makes an appearance, although it's rather off-putting that he refers to himself in the third person a la Bob Dole or Barry Bonds.<br /><br />One thing that should be clear though: there is no such thing as \\"Moneyball\\", and the sport Beane is actually referring to is baseball, not the lottery. Sadly, he does not give up the secret clues on how to win or even have a better chance at winning the lottery. I do not know these clues either (which is why I originally bought the book) but I did see a software program once so I know they exist.

B000F0UUT6|2.0|We are huge fans of A&E's Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  We were excited by the prospect of a 10th anniversary edition of the film, expecially the interviews and retrospectives promised by this edition.  The DVD special interviews were very disappointing and primarily feature the actors playing Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mary Bennet and Mr. Wickham.  While their interviews were interesting, the main characters are conspicuously absent.  I will likely sell my copy on eBay and wait for a more in-depth special edition that has video interviews with all the cast--especially the main characters.  Also, the behind the scenes clips are very limited.  While the booklet is okay, it would have been nice if the producers had invested more time and attention to this edition's special features.  If they had, I would have been willing to pay double for it!
B00063EMJ6|4.0|NEIL YOUNG'S GREATEST HITS is a wonderful collection of songs by one of the finest singers ever who creates good music and this has some excellent songs like in \\"Down By The River', \\"Rocking in the Free World\\" and more. This should be in any classic rock fan's collection. Highly recommended.
B000I5X80G|3.0|And so it finally begins and it's not encouraging. After 10+ years of waiting we get Neil Young and Crazy Horse Live At Fillmore East; a partial rendering of the electric set from March 1970.  For the casual Neil Young fan this probably seems like a cool release. I have to admit I felt a rush of excitement and anticipation when I saw the article in the Friday Weekend Section of The Wall Street Journal - until further reading revealed what we were really getting. <br /> <br />Any Neil Young fan worth his salt already has this show (with the missing Cinnamon Girl) plus many of the other key live shows from this period of Neil's career. It's been too long. We've taken matter into our own hands with the tape traders and boot sellers. Rock and Roll Cowboy (4 CD 1995 release of live material from 1966 - 1994) filled the Archives void in a big way. We've even found some of the much promised unreleased studio stuff in bootlegs like Chrome Dreams (unreleased album from 1975).  <br /> <br />The other thing that's getting under my skin about this release is the so called DVD that we are being asked to pay extra for. Back in the vinyl days this photo collage with music would have been a booklet included with the record. [You've got love the love the trailer on Neil's web site with him looking at the pictures that are to be used for the DVD. Check the date: 1997!] <br /> <br />So how is this any different from what Dylan has been doing? Well first of all Dylan didn't announce his Bootleg Series and then not release anything for 10 years. His stuff just starting coming with little advance warning. Second, when he released live material he gave the entire show in the actual order; not some edited version (e.g., the legendary 1966 show with The Band). <br /> <br />So what's next? We hear there will be another live release in February 2007. I'm betting something from the Tonight's The Night tour from late summer 1973 (London or Long Island). But who knows, we might get one of the acoustic shows from the pre-Harvest tour. Then a multi CD set late in 2007 that will supposedly chronicle Neil's first ten years. What are we in for; The Squires and Buffalo Springfield outtakes? I say let's get on with the 70's, the most productive period of his career. Live shows from the 1973 Time Fades Away tour, the 1974 CSNY tour and the 1976 tours with Crazy Horse would get things back on track. <br /> <br />Anyway Neil has missed a big opportunity to make up for lost time. The first NYA release out of the gate should have rocked us back on our heels. Instead we get this very tentative first step. Too little too late. <br />

B000AGTPUU|4.0|This DVD was playing sort of in the background at last year's big holiday multi-day family gathering, with a dozen or so children under 8 years visiting cousins. The movie did not get my undivided attention, therefore, although it did get played multiple times.  It did keep kids (and me too) from getting restless during some down times. In future years, I think I will play it again during such visits.<br /><br />One nice surprise was the way the movie pushed beyond stereotypes in a reasonably subtle way.<br /><br />If I remember correctly (the memory is vague now), one of the themes for the child characters was recognizing one's strengths and learning to use them, and appreciating that other individuals have different types of gifts.<br /><br />One of the main characters had the gift of leadership aptitude.  As a child, I never gave leadership much thought -- how it works, etc.  I'm glad the movie brought it forth, as something of importance.  I didn't notice till years later, on the job, the important difference between a boss (or military officer) having the formal title and power to command people, versus a person who can lead -- who can inspire, motivate, and influence others even if he/she lacks a formal title. I don't know whether children viewing this movie will actually notice the subtle message that leadership is an important thing, since there is so much else going on in the movie that is more entertaining.  But then again, young kids often watch the same DVD/video many times.

Don't miss them live because the show always adds more each time. Get both DVDs since the concerts and songs are quite different. Unfortunately you have to buy the Chloe Agnew DVD at the concert so far, but all the CDs of the girls are on amazon. I have the Hayley Westenra DVD as well, which I advise getting after Celtic Woman rather than before since that concert is quite different in sound.
B000ICLHIE|3.0|OK, I get it and I don't dispute it.  Tom Waits is a cultural genius, a national treasure, a musical icon.  But this 54-song set may leave you itchy by the time you'e done if you aren't A True Fan.  I have heard that the man gives an awesome, heartfelt and moving concert, and I readily admit some of his songs here are stellar (\\"The Road to Peace\\" is an instant classic, in my opinion), but a little can go a mighty long way, even if you possess a varied and mature musical palate.  I don't understand how a person could listen to a few of the spoken-word prose poems more than twice.  It seems to be a rule of thumb that most triple albums contain both brilliance and bull****.  I don't want to seem too negative, as it's fine as far as it goes and for the unique genre that Tom occupies almost by himself.  But just know that if you read all the 5-star reviews and think this will inevitably please all music lovers then you may be in for an expensive disappointment.

B000J103PC|4.0|This movie revolves around Meryl Streep (Miranda), the editor of a prestigious fashion magazine who is, to all intents and purposes, the worst boss ever.  She is cold, cruel, demanding, rude, and altogether wonderful in this part.  Her counterpart is Andy, played by Anne Hathaway, who is hired as Miranda's second assistant despite the fact that she is a size 6 (gasp!) who has no fashion sense and very little interest in the fashion industry.  Her goal is to become a journalist and this job is just a stepping stone along the way.  Andy's honesty and earnest attitude gain Miranda's respect and soon she is transformed into a fashionable, workaholic who sacrifices her friends and social life in order to be at Miranda's beck and call.  She goes along with Miranda's plan to reduce the influence of the first assistant, and thus becomes a full-fledged Junior Miranda.  This is an entertaining movie, slickly produced and wonderfully acted.  Meryl Streep plays Miranda with an understated elegance and feline grace, her humanity lying deep within her cold exterior, only allowed to show through in one brief scene.  As always, Meryl Streep makes this character into someone truly memorable, and the movie well worth seeing.

B00006DEF9|5.0|Only the cloudiest of curmudgeons could possibly begrudge a musical as pervasively buoyant and consistently inventive as this 1952 classic. Thanks to the unstoppable creative energy of Gene Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen and the sharp writing of the redoubtable team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden, what could have been just another MGM confection is really a non-stop singing and dancing entertainment and a clever satire on the talkie revolution that transformed Hollywood's movie industry in the late 1920's. Fortunately, the 50th Anniversary, two-disc set released in 2002 is an appropriate tribute to this film since it includes a pristine print, clear audio and plentiful extras.<br /><br />Kelly's athleticism and natural braggadocio manner are put to optimal use in the fictionalized story of silent screen stars Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, both of whom make a particularly bumptious transition to sound with their romantic costume epic, \\"The Dueling Cavalier\\". Thanks to the introduction of primitive and awkwardly placed microphones, the stars' mute over-emoting looks and sounds ludicrous, in particular, Lina's Bronx-accented helium squealing. Off-screen, Don can barely stand Lina, and what's more, he becomes smitten with young ing&eacute;nue Kathy Selden much to the consternation of Lina. After the movie's disastrous preview, Don's best friend and piano accompanist Cosmo Brown comes up with the idea of turning the potential fiasco into a musical, \\"The Dancing Cavalier\\", with Lina's unbearably comic voice dubbed by Kathy.<br /><br />While Lina uses blackmail to keep Kathy under wraps, the plot still comes to its inevitable conclusion but not before an elaborate and rather anachronistic production number, the fourteen-minute \\"Broadway Melody Ballet\\". Although not as enthralling as Kelly's similarly lengthy tribute to the French master artists in \\"An American in Paris\\" the year before, this number has all the razzle-dazzle one could possibly hope for in a single number, including the leggy Cyd Charisse dancing flawlessly as a coin-flipping femme fatale. In fact, the whole film is so energetic and saturated with color that it's hard not to be enraptured.<br /><br />Most every musical number is a memorable classic from the classroom antics of Kelly and O'Connor in \\"Moses Supposes\\" to the ebullient furniture prancing of \\"Good Morning\\" to O'Connor's acrobatic turns on \\"Make `Em Laugh\\" to Kelly's classic rain-drenched solo set to the title tune. Kelly is inarguably at his peak here, and so is the youthful O'Connor who proves even more than the females, to be Kelly's most compatible dance partner. Nineteen-year old Debbie Reynolds is kewpie doll-adorable as Kathy and dances with hard-earned ease with her veteran colleagues. The scene stealer, however, is Jean Hagen who plays the not-so-dumb Lina with genuine comic &eacute;lan. You will also notice twenty-year old Rita Moreno playing a Clara Bow-like movie star named Zelma Zanders.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a wonderfully insightful if somewhat crowded commentary track with participation from O'Connor, Reynolds, Donen, Comden, Green, Charisse, and co-star Kathleen Freeman (who plays Lina's failed elocution teacher), as well as film historian Rudy Behlmer and director Baz Luhrmann. Most of them also participate and repeat their recollections in a thirty-minute featurette on the second disc, \\"What a Glorious Feeling\\" made specifically for the DVD. There are two other shorts - one on the first disc called \\"Reel Sounds\\" which details the evolution of the sound picture during the setting of the movie, and the other is a lengthier 1996 documentary, \\"Musicals Great Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM\\", which provides a broader view of the classic MGM musicals of the period.<br /><br />There are also trailers, some outtakes and antiquated movie excerpts of songs written by Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, who penned \\"Singin' in the Rain\\". All in all, this is a terrific package for a most deserving Hollywood classic well worth repeated viewings.erving Hollywood classic well worth repeated viewings.

I bought the DVD because the book wasn't available, and I wanted to show my husband a piece of my childhood. <br /> <br />I ended up turning off the TV within 5 minutes. The characters sang, it seemed, every 30 seconds, and each song lasted 15 seconds. The lyrics weren't that good either. It was very obvious that they were trying to stretch the book to 60 minutes- but they did it very poorly.

It's melodramatic, poorly-acted and plodding, with all sorts of preposterous flourishes that make suspension of disbelief a real chore.<br /><br />For instance: Gong Li's character is supposed to be a second-generation Chinese-Cuban whose mother went with Che to fight in Angola...etc...but that's about all I could understood, since she speaks with such a thick Chinese accent.  Exactly what this exotic biography adds to story (except 30 mins of screen time) is unclear to me -maybe I am missing something there- but it seems obvious that no second-generation Cuban citizen would still sound Chinese.<br /><br />The whole movie is like that - which is frustrating, because it could have been SO GOOD with just an ounce of realism.  But rather than include all of those interesting details of drug policing that made the original series gritty, Mann opts for a James Bond-style multinational espionage fantasy.  And with the tone of the film, this just doesn't work.  Filmed almost entirely in blue, and scored with dark alternative music, Miami Vice isn't just moody, it's downright depressive.<br /><br />Of course, it is very, very pretty.  As always, Mann's cinematography is above perfect.  Every frame could be a postcard.  But that's just not enough to save this dog.
B00004VXYG|5.0|The enormously talented Emma Thompson wrote the marvelous screenplay for this brilliant adaptation of Jane Austen's novel of the same name. Ms. Thompson rightly won a Academy Award for Best Screenplay for her efforts. The film itself, first class in every respect, received seven Academy Award nominations and was named Golden Globe Best Picture of the Year.<br /><br />The film revolves around the two Dashwood sisters, the passionate and highly impetuous Marianne (Kate Winslet) and the more conformist and restrained Elinor (Emma Thompson), who have had a sudden reversal of fortune, having been left impoverished upon the death of their father. Their financial condition is exacerbated by the evil machinations of their sister in law, Fanny Dashwood (Harriet Walter), who manipulates her husband, their half brother, into pinching pennies with them, causing them no end of hardship.<br /><br />This nineteenth century tale of morals and manners details the romantic trials and tribulations of the Dashwood sisters. Marianne falls in love with a scoundrel, John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who leaves her high and dry for a woman with a fortune. Meanwhile, the kind and courteous Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) falls in love with Marianne and suffers from unrequited love for some time, until Marianne regains her senses. Elinor falls in love with Edwards Ferrars (Hugh Grant), her evil sister in law's brother, and he with her, but many obstacles to their pairing are interposed along the way. All comes out right in the end, however, but it is the getting there that makes this film a must see.<br /><br />A witty, funny, and romantic film, it boasts a first class ensemble cast. While Ms. Thompson may be a bit long in the tooth for the role which she plays, her thespian talents and charm enable her to pull the proverbial rabbit out of the hat. Beautifully directed by Ang Lee, this film should top the list of those who love Jane Austen and those who adore superlative period pieces.
B00005JPDS|4.0|If anyone has viewed the respective talk shows over the past few weeks, he or she is familiar with the story of Chris Gardner, a down-on-his-luck father that overcame overwhelming odds to become an established stockbroker and successful businessman in his own right.  It is story that has been vividly brought to the screen with a dynamic and heart-wrenching performance from star Will Smith and a poignant acting debut from the actor's real-life son, Jaden.  Both father and son play so well off each other that it was indeed a stroke of genius for such a casting coup.<br /><br />Thandie Newton continues to deliver memorable turns as she assays the role of Gardner's wife Linda who abandons both husband and son for the chance of a better life in New York, miles away from their San Francisco location.<br /><br />Speaking of \\"the city by the bay,\\" it continues to be one of the most appealing locations and director Gabriele Muccino takes advantage of this fact, always making sure that the audience sees notable landmarks in the background.<br /><br />In a movie of this type, where the \\"saccharine level\\" could be very high, Muccino keeps them at a minimum, only showing three scenes that start the tear ducts to do their jobs.  This is a tribute to his skills as a director.<br /><br />Andrea Guerra's score is never overpowering, always effectively subtle to coincide with the on-screen events.<br /><br />In all, \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is one film that should be pursued by all moviegoers.
B00AQSN7HE|4.0|I admit that I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first watched CASINO ROYALE. I had eagerly been looking forward to this James Bond movie because it was Ian Fleming's first novel starring Bond. The novel had been adapted to the screen before, but only as a comedy parody and a lukewarm made-for-television movie. This version of CASINO ROYALE was to be an &#34;official&#34; part of the James Bond cinematic canon. It was going to be the movie that explained the beginnings of James Bond's career as Britain's top secret agent. Production and filming began and then suddenly stopped. The studios decided that to keep the James Bond franchise viable they needed a new approach. So, they fired Pierce Brosnan. They fired some of the screenwriters and sent the script Paul Haggis for a rewrite because the film wasn't dark enough.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention they fired Pierce Brosnan? Brosnan was the best actor to portray James Bond since Sean Connery originally played the character. In fact, not so long ago, Brosnan's portrayal of James Bond saved the franchise from total ruin and in doing so also prevented a certain film studio from going bankrupt. Brosnan was not only the right man for the role, he was the perfect man for the role. Had he not been fired and had he been willing (which he probably would have) he could have played James Bond for another two or three pictures. He should have played Bond for a few more movies. Instead, the filmmakers decided to start virtually from scratch. Pierce Brosnan was fired and Daniel Craig was eventually hired in his place.<br /><br />In the merrie ole land of England, when the news was released, James Bond fans in Britain went nuts. Protests were held and letters were written. Craig couldn't be Bond. Craig is average height, but traditionally Bond has been portrayed as being tall. Also, Craig has blond hair and Bond is supposed to have dark hair. The thing I found most interesting about the choice is that Craig is virtually an unknown actor in the United States. Outside of his performance in the artsy film LAYER CAKE no one in the U.S. had ever heard of Craig before he was announced as the next James Bond. Considering the tone of CASINO ROYALE, this is strange because CASINO ROYALE is the most Americanized of all James Bond pictures even though Bond is a very British character (for example, the high stakes game of gambling that is central to the film's plot revolves around Texas Hold `Em. You can't get any more Americanized than that). I guess the filmmakers felt they were offending their core audience enough the way it was and didn't want to turn them totally off by hiring someone like Brad Pitt or Matt Damon.<br /><br />In CASINO ROYALE, the audience witnesses James Bond's first two assassinations; the two killings that allow him the double zero and validate his license to kill. This opening sequence is followed by the usual opening credits song and like half the Bond movies that have ever been made, it was far too long. We next find Bond racing through the streets and leaping from buildings like Superman somewhere in Africa. The chase and the ensuing events which follow cause an international controversy and thanks to a camera-phone Bond finds himself on the cover of newspapers. He's taken off duty for a while and M (Judy Dench) tells him to take a vacation. He does, but uses the opportunity to do some spying on his spare time. He stalks a businessman who bleeds out of eyes and who seems to be supplementing his gun-running operation by playing in high stakes poker games. Bond is selected to play in the next high-stakes game that the villain, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) is playing in. The game takes place in Monte Carlo and Bond is escorted to the event by the beautiful and intelligent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) whom is being sent to insure that the millions of dollars in investment aren't wasted in vain. There is a connection between Lynd and Bond, but it doesn't begin romantically. It begins as business, turns to friendship, and then into love. James Bond in love? Sad, but true. I guess the point of this relationship is to illustrate why Bond never settles down and became a playboy and womanizer. Throw in a bit of Aston Martin driving scenes, some torture, and a couple of betrayals to make things complete.<br /><br />Overall, CASINO ROYALE turned out to be what I expected: a great action movie, a good spy film, and just a decent James Bond picture. Craig is better in the role than I expected him to be. He's a good actor and even though he is the &#34;new, re-imagined&#34; James Bond, he does a good job of staying true to the legacy bestowed to him while making it fresh and new. Eva Green is full of a feminine mystique that many Bond girls in the past have lacked. Her character, Vesper Lynd, isn't just beautiful and brainy; she's also independent, compassionate, and wise. Unlike the models and actresses who have played Bond girls before, Lynd comes off as being more of a girl-next-door than a supermodel. Judi Dench returns to her role as M and like many of the films she acts in, she steals every scene she is in. Mads Mikkelsen has played several oddballs and freaks in his career and fits well into the role of the eerie and sinister Le Chiffre. Finally, Jeffery Wright isn't on screen much, but he's great as Bond's American CIA counterpart Felix Leiter.<br /><br />Despite dragging in several parts, CASINO ROYALE has a lot of action. There's not quite as much as one would expect from a Bond picture, but this isn't a typical Bond picture. Also missing from the picture are any gadgets and the presence of inventor extraordinaire, Q. There are no gadgets in this movie.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed CASINO ROYALE. It felt very much like a typical American spy-thriller, which is what I found most interesting about the picture. As I mentioned before, Bond is a very British character, but in CASINO ROYALE he comes off as being more like a typical American anti-hero. The filmmakers set out to re-vamp the James Bond franchise.

B000JRYNXE|5.0|I've loved Gwen Stefani ever since her No Doubt days.  When I first got \\"Love Angel Music Baby,\\" it did take a few days to grow on me, and I ended up loving it....eventually.  For \\"The Sweet Escape,\\" it also had to grow on me, but quicker than \\"L.A.M.B.\\" did. She follows the same routine, with fresh 80's style dance tracks, including the modern-day flair.  And the album still holds Gwen's distinct vocal quality; you can't mistake that!
B00005JOLI|1.0|It's inevitable that people will compare a movie like this, especially with such an unoriginal name, to Lord of the Rings, but I won't deal with that.      Probably what really just turned me off from the film was that it lacked any real development in addition to a general lack of originality.  Some of the names made me cringe as they provided a perfect example as to why people outside of the fantasy genre just don't respect it.  And of course, we have the farm boy who unsuspectingly gets chosen by fate to save the remnants of the world.  He has trouble accepting this duty at first even though all he really seemed to need was to learn three or four words of elvish magic in order to beat his main enemy.    The best I can really say is that there's very little development or depth to most of the characters.  Everything pretty much just happens within a minute or two.  I was able to guess most of the plot twists well before they happened.  And I'm almost positive I can predict the reappearance of his older brother/cousin and guess the circumstances.  One problem with all of this may have been that the movie doesn't even last 2 hours.  It relied heavily on the typical symphony music and cliche speeches to invoke the various emotions and get the message across.    I can't say it was an all together terrible movie.  It wasn't.  The initial scenes with the dragon as a baby were probably the most interesting I've ever seen (That doesn't last long though since the dragon has to magically evolve).  The CG elements were fine but would probably look cheap to those who really scrutinze it and compare it to some of the other really big productions out there.  The overall scenery really reminded me of Dragonheart as far as picture quality went.  The battle scenes were simple and basic.  Most of the final battle focused on the dragon breathing fire, not really bothering too much with the small armies fighting, which I'm sure will satisfy many anyways.  Once again, though, I just have to say that it somehow just felt short-changed.  I wouldn't really discourage you from seeing it, but I frankly wish I had simply waited until it comes out on HBO or Showtime in a year or so.
B000HT386M|5.0|I knew this was going to be a good movie, but surprisingly was a lot better than I thought. The actors were just awesome and this is so hilarious - never a dull moment! It is a good lesson to learn, also, that even the dull, mundane things in life are so important, especially when it comes to your family. Loved the ending, too!
0345452577|4.0|Jonathan Kellerman has been one of my favorite authors for years, particularly the Alex Delaware novels.  This - non-Delaware novel - starts slow but delivers in the end.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the slow beginning.  I even put it down a time or two thinking I'd never get where he was going, but I'm glad I persisted.  It turned out to be very well worth it.  This is an old fashioned cerebral murder mystery with our hero and amateur sleuth the psychologist doctor lover of the first victim.  Eh?  Got the hairs standing up?  He is befriended (in an odd circumscribed manner) by an older pathologist who invites him to dinner with friends one evening.  As the murders continue our hero begins receiving obscure clues - and he's not sure who to ascribe them to.  This is a well plotted, very satisfying read if you can make it through the - sorry - slow beginning.  Kellerman reveals a whole new side to his writing abilities in this deeply thoughtful mystery.  Loved it!!
B000IZJ1KC|3.0|Not bad but comming from Abbath I expected more. Most of the songs are mid-tempo Motorhead/Bathory (especially in the vocals) influenced metal. I was hoping for more of that dark Immortal sound as their last album Sons Of Northern Darkness was so excellent. There are hints of that power, some of these songs sound like a logical progression from SOND but overall they just don't have that extra something, that chills up the spine darkness. The guitar melodies are a little too happy and the vocals are sometimes weak, especially when Abbath tries to growl melodically. Between Two Worlds doesn't hit the emotional peaks or excitement of Abbath's previous work and seems unispired comparitively. Oh well I guess I'll have to wait for Immortal's reformation to get my fix.
B000AP04L0|5.0|If you haven't seen this you are a bigger dork than Milton; If you gave it anything but 5 stars, you are stupider than Lumburg.  This is one of the best movies out there.  Don't watch it for some deep plot, or complex storyline.  Just watch it and enjoy the characters and dialogue.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|First off, I really like Michael Mann. He has a great visual eye and when the action comes around, he always does something different and intense. That is true for this movie as well, only there is so little action it almost bores you to sleep. For me the problem was the whole middle of the film w/Colin and Li; It's almost like a whole different movie....I liked the set up in the beginning; I have the patience to allow a story to unfold, don't get me wrong...but this movie had no business being this long. Both Foxx and Farrell are actually perfect for their parts, and I found the performances enjoyable. Loved the sniper rifle scene near the start, the trailer scene and shootout near the end; The cinematography, as expected, captures alot of great images and skyscapes; The boat scene at the beginning is very impressive...but in the end I can make this into a really solid 1 hour and twenty minute movie w/the help of my fast forward button...I suggest you do the same.
B000002I97|5.0|John Prine's self-titled debut album appeared in 1971 when he was about 24 years old.  The songs within it would be great coming from a 30 or 40-year old with significant life experience.  Their depth, compassion and understanding are simply amazing coming from such a young person.<br /><br />That said, the album opens with two counterculture songs, starting with the somewhat silly \\"Illegal Smile\\", which laments the balance between the \\"evil\\" of marijuana use and the penalties imposed by society. It's a great singalong song, and ends with the wonderful nonsense rhyme \\"well done, hot dog bun, my sister.....is a nun!\\" Next comes \\"Spanish Pipe Dream\\" in which Prine encourages us to \\"blow up your TV\\" and \\"move to the country\\", advice that's probably more relevant today than in 1970.<br /><br />\\"Hello In There\\" is an immeasurably sad and poignant song about the lives of older people--again, it's hard to believe that a 24-year old could have such insight.  Later Prine revisits the theme from a country perspective with \\"Angel from Montgomery\\", a song that's been covered countless times--Bonnie Raitt and Prine do a great duet on his \\"John Prine Live\\" album.<br /><br />Two anti-war songs come soon after, the rollicking \\"Your Flag Decal Won't Get You into Heaven Anymore\\" and the anguished \\"Sam Stone\\", one of the few Prine songs that ever got any mainstream radio airplay--strange given its graphic chorus \\"there's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes; Jesus Christ died for nothin', I suppose.\\"<br /><br />\\"Donald and Lydia\\" is another achingly poignant song, this time about a young couple separated by his life as a private at Fort Polk.  Prine gives us another look at Army life with \\"Oh Heck\\"--a love song written by a soldier --the title comes from one of Prine's army buddies looking at the lyrics (which includes \\"the cannibals can catch me and fry me in a pan, long as I got my woman\\") and exclaiming \\"oh heck!\\"<br /><br />In \\"Far From Me\\", the love affair is close range, but falling apart, \\"ain't it funny how an old broken bottle looks just like a diamong ring.\\"  In \\"Quiet Man\\", the love affair is over and Prine waxes elliptical in the beautiful chorus--\\"oodles of light/what a beautiful sight/both of God's eyes are shining tonight/rays and beams of  incredible dreams/I am the quiet man.\\"<br /><br />Family turmoil is the theme of \\"Six O'Clock News\\"--again, it's hard to see how a 24-year old could have such insight.  \\"Paradise\\" is autobiographical, I think, as Prine, who was raised in Illinois, visits his father's homeland in Kentucky only to see that \\"Mr. Peabody's coal train has hauled it away.\\"  I've sung this song at open mike nights more times than I can remember.<br /><br />Hands down the funniest song on the CD is \\"Pretty Good\\", which runs the gamut from used car salesmen to sex with aliens to \\"the saviours' feast\\" featuring Allah and Buddha.  Has anyone written a funnier line than \\"up in the sky an Arabian rabbi fed Quaker oats to a priest\\"?  \\"Flashback Blues\\" finishes the set, an OK song, but in my mind not the equal of all the songs preceding.<br /><br />Prine's vocals are steady throughout and the arrangements all work, but the signature feature of \\"John Prine\\" and of much of his work over 35 years is the quality of his songs, a feature that made and has kept me a big Prine fan.how an old broken bottle looks just like a diamong ring.\\"  In \\"Quiet Man\\", the love affair is over and Prine waxes elliptical in the beautiful chorus--\\"oodles of light/what a beautiful sight/both of God's eyes are shining tonight/rays and beams of  incredible dreams/I am the quiet man.\\"    Family turmoil is the theme of \\"Six O'Clock News\\"--again, it's hard to see how a 24-year old could have such insight.  \\"Paradise\\" is autobiographical, I think, as Prine, who was raised in Illinois, visits his father's homeland in Kentucky only to see that \\"Mr. Peabody's coal train has hauled it away.\\"  I've sung this song at open mike nights more times than I can remember.

B00005JKWJ|2.0|I don't normally write reviews for movies I don't like but I made an exception in this case. I thought I'd rent the Blade series after catching part of Blade Trinity on HBO. This has got to be the worst of the three.  This was a one star movie up until the final act, which redeems the movie to two stars.    Wesley Snipes is such a boring actor...he shows no emotion whatsover. I know it's part of his character to be that way but the way he does it is just so BORING and uninspiring.  It's like watching paint dry.    To the funny parts...I found myself laughing out loud at Snipes cracking his neck before a fight, putting on his sunglasses (you'll see) and swinging his sword around just to put it back in its sheath.  Oh, and the stupid one liners (not just by Blade) were laugh out loud funny too.    The plot of the movie is that the vampires go to Blade for a truce so they can join forces to fight a new enemy - one that is stronger than them.  Blade agrees but is watching his back the entire time.  Whistler miraculously returns after killing himself in Blade I.  Long story short (spoiler), the new enemy was created by the vampire leader to rid their race of impurities...an experiment that got out of control.  After Blade kills the problem, of course the vampires turn on him and we're back to square one.    The action in this movie was just okay compared to action/martial arts movies of today. The fight scenes had the appearance of being choreographed rather than just being good fight scenes (i.e. ten enemies line up one by one to fight Blade instead of all jumping on him). If you want a good vampire movie - watch Underworld. Both of the Underworld movies are better than this one (even Evolution).  If you want to confirm that you've wasted two hours of your life...this is your movie.
B000IJ79WU|1.0|First, the bulk of the \\"Donner Cut\\" is exactly the same as the original theatrical release.  Second, most of what is new only serves to screw with the continuity and diminish the overall story. Third, most of the \\"new\\" stuff is really just old screen tests - not production shots. <br /> <br />(i) To clear Lois' mind of Clark's secret, Superman turns back time, which wipes clean everything but the bully he fought in the Alaskan diner.  From comic fans to Seinfeld to SNL, this was the most ridiculed stunt from the first movie.  Personally, I enjoyed the more credible \\"Lester's Kiss\\" that Clark gives Lois (a quick shot of super-breath could cause memory loss? maybe?).  I also regret the deletion from this cut of the triumphant return of the White House roof by Supes.  <br /> <br />(ii) Superman and Lois have the cuddling scene in the fortress prior to Superman losing his powers.  Like most, I doubt Lois could've survived sex with the Krptonian - I like to think a human Clark impregnated Lois to produce a son for \\"Superman Returns (marketed as Superman 3 for picking-up where II left off).\\" In the extras, the editor gloats over the profound realization his team had that, \\"only Superman should be seen kissing Lois.\\"  What the ...?  Dude, there's no distinction in her mind between the two at that point - the whole point of the kiss was to restore the distinction! <br /> <br />(iii) Donner also used a lackluster screen test in place of the scene where Clark reveals his identity.  This scene not only had less nuance than a George Reeves' episode, it disturbingly cuts between a bushy-haired Reeves and a slick-haired Reeves.  The original was great because it revealed the subconscious urge in Clark to tell Lois everything, which played much more dramatically/romantically.   <br /> <br />The new scenes of Brando and Reeves were the only thing that added any depth not explored in the original, and - for my money - you can get that depth better from Superman graphic novels than this DVD.  <br /> <br />The editors and director seem really impressed with themselves in the Special Features - they should be embarrassed.  DC doesn't appear to have involved themselves too deeply in the project, and I'm glad!
B000EJ9VUW|5.0|I caught this band a few years ago at siren fest on Coney Island, where I happened to be standing next to a fat middle aged man who, before the Liars came on, kept shouting \\"YEAHH! The return of the real Brooklyn rock!!\\"  Needless to say, I was looking forward to seeing this band. <br />Liars came on and were extremely pretentious (no surprise there), and in my opinion.. annoying.  After that show I wrote them off basically until hearing \\"they were wrong...\\" which is a tough listen but ultimately rewarding and original. <br />Drum's Not Dead, however, what a great release!  This is the first review I've written for Amazon, and probably the last, that's how much I'm behind this one.  First off, the production on this is absolutely perfect, they obviously spent a lot of time on the sonics of this record and it shows... so much so that you won't even notice when you find yourself bobbing your head wildly, that some songs don't even contain a discernable (spelling?  haha) melody.. the songs just sound that good.  Every track nails its mood perfectly.  Hearing this is like having sex with a beautiful witch (or maybe.. warlock? ha!).
B00005JPDS|4.0|SPOILERS, SPOILERS, and, yes, more SPOILERS.<br /><br />Stockbroker Chris Gardner's real life rags-to-riches story was featured in a 15 minute segment on 20/20 some years ago and it was memorable and inspirational enough that, now, we have THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, a film based, more or less, on that story. Now, certain facts have been altered a bit, ostensibly, for better dramatic consumption. Three examples of changes that were wrought are: back in 1981, Chris actually had custody of his infant son, not a five year old; instead of being unpaid, he did receive a meager stipend in his brokering internship; and Chris's wife Linda is fully fictionalized in the film. Whether such changes work or are even needed is, of course, left for you to decide. What's not up to debate is the quality of man it takes to pull off an underdog story like this. The real Chris Gardner must've been (and, presumably, still is) a formidably resilient man who made his own luck, who remained undeterred by a life that was kicking him to the curb.<br /><br />The film's plot: THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS (The misspelled \\"happyness\\" originates from an outside mural displayed on the crappy Chinatown day care center to which Chris sends his son) is set in 1981, in San Francisco. Go-getter Chris Gardner (Will Smith), who had been an excellent student as a child but who now, as an adult, feels he's basically amounted to nothing, is eking out a hand-to-mouth living as an unsuccessful hawker of a hospital equipment called a bone density scanner, which proves to be a flop with the medical community. With a young 5 year old and an increasingly bitter wife to provide for, it's tough going for Chris. In fact, it's his wife Linda (a worn down, shrewish Thandie Newton), who toils in multiple shifts and, more often than not, furnishes the capital. Linda finds this lifestyle too unbearable and soon takes off for New York. Upon the insistence of Chris, she reluctantly leaves their son Christopher (Jaden Smith) in his care. Bye bye, Linda.<br /><br />Chris has a plan. A few scenes back, a fleeting encounter with a friendly stockbroker sporting a red Ferrari - who informed him that all one needed to have success in stocks was to be \\"good with people and good with numbers\\" - had impacted him enough  that he had decided to become a stockbroker himself. A month of persistence (or, basically, politely hounding an executive outside his brokerage building and then impressing him with his Rubik's Cube skills) lands him an interview for a prospective 6-month internship program with the prestigious Dean Witter firm, with the possibility of being hired at internship's end. He passes the interview and is offered a spot in the program, despite showing up dressed like a transient (a long story, involving paint, parking tickets, and prison). However, to his dismay, he finds that it is an unsalaried internship; after some long, hard thinking, he decides to still go for it, while re-dedicating himself to selling more of his bone density scanners to make ends meet.<br /><br />Of course, things go bad immediately. With his wife and her steady income gone, Chris struggles badly. He runs afoul of the landlord, the IRS, and, in one kinda funny sequence, of one dogged taxi driver. He does manage to sell a scanner, only to have his finances subsequently confiscated by the IRS. Down to literally mere dollars, he and his son succumb to poverty and become homeless; they find themselves forced to wait in line for hours to get into homeless shelters and, when not getting in the shelter, having to spend nights in public rest rooms. Meanwhile, during the day, Chris dons his business attire and attends his internship. He finds it difficult to compete with the other 19 aspirers in the program as they manage to put in 9 hours daily, whereas he's only able to spend 6 hours in the firm (he has to pick up his son from day care, catch the bus, get in line for the shelter, etc). To compensate, while in the firm, hedoesn't drink water (thus, less time in the bathroom) and keeps the phone constantly in hand (discovering he gains 8 minutes by doing so). As the 6 months of internship continue to elapse, things get progressively worse for the Gardner family. And then the last day of internship comes...<br /><br />I won't lie, it's a pretty dark, gloomy film; but there's a beauty and a sincerity to it. THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is imbued with a certain stark honesty, depicting Chris' struggles as he copes with his internship while simultaneously walking that tightrope between life on and off the streets. This film is sentimental without being too cloying and contains enough levity to thankfully provide a much-needed counterpoint to the main character's dreary, ever worsening plight.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this film. It's 180 degrees away from the normal, breezy Will Smith flick. Although he's done serious cinema in the past, he's never put as much of his soul and his heart as he does in this one. It's evident that PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a personal project of his. One reason for his emotional investment is, undeniably, the casting of young Christopher, unaffectedly portrayed by Jaden Smith, who happens to be Will Smith's real life son. Their natural chemistry is what makes this whole shebang works. The bond between the two is a delight to behold. If there's any doubt that Will Smith is genuinely a nice guy, his sweet, easy relationship with his son should dispel any doubt, if there were any, to begin with. Young Jaden Smith is a fresh, new talent who is effectively unmannered in his acting and also delivers with some pretty good kid jokes.<br /><br />I've never had any doubts that the Fresh Prince can act. He proved that early on in SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION. Will Smith was also great in ALI, and he is equally charismatic here as he unveils a focused commitment to dramatic acting. Once again, his innate likability holds him in good stead. There are moments in the film where he'll make you positively weep. Witness his performance as he and Christopher are forced to spend a night in a BART station men's room, or the fleeting look of bleakness which crosses his face when he's forced to relinquish his last five dollar bill to loan his boss cab fare, and, brilliantly depicted, the held-in-check emotions he displays in the movie's culminating moments when he finds out he just got hired (c'mon, you did know he was gonna get the gig, right?). I wouldn't be at all surprised if an Oscar nomination is in the offing.<br /><br />So what else can I say to convince folks to check this film out? This movie is fairly stark without being patronizing, hopeful without being saccharine. Yes, there are several patented Hollywood moments (how could there not?), but these are curtailed by Smith's awesomely gritty performance. His protagonist is a man of big smarts whose dignity, optimism, perseverance, resilience, and love for his son never flag. Chris Gardner realizes, too, that resorting to bitterness and anger isn't the answer. Instead, throughout his travails, he maintains his composure, his wits, his smile, and his warmth, qualities which inevitably carry him to the summit. This movie is emotional, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting.

B000056HE9|5.0|This is a light Christmas movie with a comical touch. Cary Grant played an angel Dudley who met Julia, the Bishop's wife (Loretta Young) on the street. Anyone's encounter with the angel would find the experience close and personal - the story he told, the small miracle he performed belied his understanding of every one's need. The beneficiaries include the cook (Elsa Lanchester, nurse in Witness for Prosecution), the secretary, Professor Wutheridge(Monty Woolley, Colonel in Since you went away), the taxi driver, Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper, Mrs. Higgins in My Fair Lady).<br /><br />The comical touch came from the Bishop (David Niven) when he found his position as the head of family seriously threatened by the angel's presence. Even his dog forsook him.<br /><br />This is a simple beautiful story. Cary Grant chose to play the angel in this movie instead of the James Stewart role in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". In retrospect, Cary Grant made a wise choice, for him and for James Stewart. And the trio - Loretta Young, Cary Grant and David Niven delivered the story superbly.

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|The long awaited \\"sequel\\" film to the Playstation game of the same name is, overall, a disappointment.  There IS some sort of storyline about Sephiroth being reborn through Jenova cells, or something, but it's hard to follow.  There are some nice in jokes that only hardcore Final Fantasy fans will get (listen to a particular ringtone), but overall this is more about the visuals and awesome action sequences than the film itself. <br /> <br />It has some nice extra features, but everything you've heard about the film itself is true.  It's nothing special, it's confusing, but it's wonderfully animated. <br /> <br />Recommended for hardcore fans only.
B000H30B2C|3.0|Peter Jackson's King Kong is a potentially great movie undone by excess.  Set design, special effects, acting, and overall 'atmosphere' are great.  There are scenes with real power like the one atop the Empire State Building and in Central Park.  But 'the whole' never quite clicked for me because it was too long and too much: too high a gross out quotient; too much improbability (and yes I know this is a movie about a giant ape and a lost island) such as the scene with the humans running amongst stampeding dinosaurs; and too much of a 'let's see if we can top the original movie' mindset like when Kong battling three T-Rexes (what's wrong with battling just one?).  After a while it all felt a little tedious despite the real positives mentioned above and particularly the standout performance by Andy Serkis as Kong.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|The original Criterion Collection release of Seven Samurai was fantastic by itself.  This reissue blows it, and nearly every other DVD out of the water.  It's easily the best DVD release of 2006.  All of the original content from the first release is here (including the fantastic Michael Jeck commentary), along with new material, such as a nearly 3 hour interview (subtitled) with Kurosawa himself.  The packaging is awesome as well, and impressive.   <br /> <br />I don't think I need to talk about how great the film is.  If you're reading this, you already know. <br /> <br />BUY IT, NOW!!  Even if you have the first release, buy this one.  It's one of the few DVD's that I can recommend to anyone.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|I had no prior knowledge of the book upon which this film was based before I watched it yesterday. Throughout the course of the movie we are inducted into the insights of the philosophy which underpins the celestine prophecy until at the conclusion we are shown what the implications of that philosophy are.<br /><br />This is very much a \\"got to get ourselves back to the garden\\" type of movie with homespun philosophy stitched together as a sort of coherent whole. AS Karl Popper said, a theory that explains everything, explains nothing. The implication being that any theory must be tested and tested to reute it otherwise it cannot satisfactorily explain anything.<br /><br />Rather like chinese food, this movie makes you feel like you have not eaten anything by the time you have reached the end. It is constructed, much as the New Age group of philosophies of which this is purported to be one, out of a series of generalised platitudes of which themselves are meaningless. For example one insight is that of coincidences. Given the number of people on the planet, coincidences must be a part of life by any reckoning, so imposing a construct upon them is rather meaningless.<br /><br />Much of the movie requires an article of faith to carry it forward. It essentially depends on our aquiescence in order to proceed. Questions of the origin of the so-called scrolls, which it seems can be reinterpreted by only a chosen few, at different times, to reveal different answers to the same questions are ignored. Rather like the fable of the origin of the ark in the mormon faith, these scrolls are given the role of established, unquestionable facts which must only be accepted as an article of faith and cannot be challenged.<br /><br />Similarly, only the initiated are able to divine the truths of the scrolls through the contact of others of the chosen few. There seems to be very few disciples who can go forth and preach the gospel to the initiated. And, of course the whole gamut of opposition to the exposure of the scrolls must include the military alongside the representatives of the established churches who envision the rise of the prophecy as a threat to their power and wealth.<br /><br />I find much of the film to be dissatisfying for a number of different reasons. As someonewho who does not believe in a deity of any description it is hard to acknowledge such a tale given the centrality of a god like being to it's development. Secondly, the idea of a heaven on earth must be attractive to environmentalists and new agers alike who seem to believe that we can go back to a sort of merrie old englande society where production is for necessity not for greed but alas that who'll premise ignores much working class histories which clearly show the nasty, brutish and short type of existance that most people had then. Technology is in many ways a curse, but in general it has brought with it a better quality of life for the majority.<br /><br />In the main though, I find this movie to be trite and superficial. It would be wonderful if we could all experience the clarity and colours of our vision but the old hippies could only do that through the consumption of such chemicals as LSD, mescalyn and peyote. For thousands of years, with little technology men and women have sought eden without success. It is nice to think of being able to achieve this Shangri-La but I am afraid that this movie gives me little confidence in our ability to do so.of opposition to the exposure of the scrolls must include the military alongside the representatives of the established churches who envision the rise of the prophecy as a threat to their power and wealth. <br /> <br />I find much of the film to be dissatisfying for a number of different reasons.

B000065BPB|5.0|I just put on some jimmy mcgriff to test these out, an album I've had for years. I've never heard his organ resonate the snare drum before - thats the example that proves the point - excellent sound!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I will admit, One of the main reasons I wanted to see this movie was because of the buzz about it being one of the most sexually explicit movies ever made in the non-porn industry. I didn't really expect to find the movie interesting, I just wanted to see what everyone was talking about.<br /><br />The first minute or so was nothing but explicit sex and I almost turned the movie off thinking it was going to be pointless, that this was all there was to the movie, but I had nothing better to do so I kept watching.<br /><br />This movie is not porn, nor is it erotica. This movie IS an uncensored look at the truth about love and sex, and is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is brutally honest, thought provoking, intense at times, and funny at others. These are characters that we can relate to, because they are real.<br /><br />I can not say enough positive things about this movie, it is art, it is truth, it is exceptional.<br /><br />It will definitely be a part of my DVD collection.
0140157352|5.0|actually ended up being a quick and practical read!
0743298020|5.0|The descriptions and summaries do not do this book justice.  It is far better than I had expected and I am so disappointed to be done with it.  The way you learn about the love of books seems odd at the begining- at least to me- but yet by the end I was feeling just that.  Attached to the characters and not wanting them to end- excited but also sad to feel the pages left to read become fewer and fewer.  Enjoy!!
B00005RHGL|5.0|The Vista series of this edition is worthy of the very highest praise, its quality is such that it also provides high value for money in every possible way. Recommendations for this film are already reviewed in abundance so there's little point in my adding to the superlatives which have already been given. I can only entreat every fan of western movies to buy this edition, it sets a standard which has never been equalled before.
B00005JOLI|2.0|To anyone who has read the books, this movie will be a Huge Disappointment! Very little of the book gets transfered to the big screen. I never will understand why screen writers feel the need to change a story/ plot line just to put their own fingerprint on it, when the original was so much better, and would have been eaiser/ cheaper to put to film. I gave the movie two stars primarily because of the casting department. Surprisingly, this movie has some very good up and coming and veterian actors. Also, one sceen stands out above the rest of the movie, when Saphira hatches and she and Eragon become acquainted. Hands down the best sceen in the movie. But, the rest of the film was a big disappointment. In the hand of the right director this movie had such promise, but was constantly falling short. Even with the huge storyline changes they could not even make sense of their own script. Please save your money, or just wait until the movie comes out on DVD!! Maybe they can improve things somehow by then.
B00005JNJV|4.0|I thought that this was a very good adaptation of Batman. It is definitely the best of the ones that have been done. The cast was excellent and Christian Bale does and outstanding job. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson are all solid as usual. The only glaring weekness in the cast is Katie (oops sorry Tom! I meant KATE) Holmes. She is totally miscast and like in Thank You For Smoking I believe she got the part because of her relationship with the ambiguous sudo husband Tom Cruise because she is not a great or good actress and she certainly is not attractive enough to be playing the fem fatale or sexy leading lady. But enough of the bashing of TomCAT. One of the reasons I like this movie is that it started out digging deap into the character and how he became Batman without waisting too much time rehashing the whole story of when he was a kid that we saw in the Michael Keaton Batman. This tells of the teenage Bruce Wayne and how he learns his fighting skills. Also, you have the whole development of the character and all his weapons and gear. The Batmobile just plain ROCKS! Like other Batman movies they seem to think you  can't just have one villiam so you get The Scarecrow who was good and plaid by a really creepy guy that was in the movei about the really creepy guy on the airplane. And Ra Sa Ghul who is done just perfectly. But why they can't just have one villian in these movies just amazes me.<br /><br />All in all this movie was just awesome and if you love Batman or have never seen it or read it before you will like this adaptation.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a story of a dying man's principles for living life. Morrie teaches his student how to die in order to learn how to live. Morrie has a lesson on life for all experiences of life, wonderful and loving lessons, that he teaches his student. I was forturnate enough to learn most of these lesson during my lifetime but it was really nice to be reminded of these lessons, as we sometimes forget to practice them along our journey. I recommend this book to all that truly want to learn how to live life to the fullest and without complications.
1860498825|5.0|This is even better than the movie they made of it. Lots of beautiful descriptions and I loved the main character. She's so strong and a real survivor. She goes through some amazing things in the course of the novel. Highly recommended.
0345475674|4.0|Pompeii was definitely a fun read. There was enough detail about the aqueducts, reservoirs and baths of the Roman empire to be interesting without overwhelming the reader in detail. This is really a mystery/thriller with an historical backdrop. Where this falls short is with its characters. Like many modern page-turning thrillers, this is more about plot (and historical background) than it is about characters. The characters were mostly uninteresting and superficial, yet the history and plot were engaging enough to sustain me, and I did like it.
B000J103PC|5.0|I wrote a review of the book, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" in which I described the character of Andrea Sachs as a whiny, oportunistic baby who expects everything to be easy while she cruises to her cushy job at the New Yorker.  I only watched the movie because I adore Anne Hathaway, Stanley Tucci and Meryl Streep.  I loved the movie.  I loved how it took the character of Andrea and transformed her from a whiny brat to into a strong, confident woman who truly wants to work and do a good job, no matter how difficult Miranda is as boss.  Of course Meryl Streep turns Miranda from a hellcat witch to a strong, tough woman in charge who will not take no or cannot be done for an answer.  The screenwriters turned the witchy side of Miranda and placed it in the character of Emily, wonderfully played by Emily Blunt.   <br /> <br />I strongly suggest that if you read the book and hated Andy, watch the movie and see how she should be.  If you read the book and loved Andy, you may not like how she is portrayed in the movie.  If you have not read the book, ignore it and just watch the movie.  You'll like it much better.
B000J103PC|2.0|Meryl Streep (and it pains me to say this) is almost an embarassment in this \\"pumped up\\" chick flick. If it weren't for the incredible cast \\"below\\" her this would have been a total disaster. The real \\"star\\" is Anne Hathaway. She is mesmerizing as the assistant to Miranda (Streep) who steals every scene she's in. And that's saying something becasue she's in every scene. I can't help but wonder what a Glenn Close or Catherine Zeta-Jones might have done with this role. As it stands her understated (way, way, way understated) performance is hollow and shrill. She mumbles throughout the entire film as if she were a female Marlon Brando. Her soft (almost inaudible) volume never fluctuates. Her face seems to be painted on as if she were wearing a mask. It's all very annoying. Too bad.....this could have been a keeper. Instead it now seems destined for the $5.00 bin.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions on a Dance Floor~ Madonna is Madonna's best release since the groundbreaking album Ray of Light. Madonna was the first artist to get permision to sample ABBA and this in itself is quite remarkable. Madonna has created here an astounding album with so many gems that it is hard to pick, but if I have to then I would say that my favorite track is Forbidden love (gotta love the vocoders, and being a huge fan of early 80's synthpop this was quite obvious that I should like this track). The book-let is really nice and liner notes are quite informative. I easily give this album 5 stars and I can not wait for her next album which I think might be realesed 2007 or 2008.
B00005JOLI|4.0|I thought that this was a sweet and exciting fairy tale. The whole setting and the dragon are fun, ... the acting is good. It's amazing how real technology can make things these days. <br />My expectations for this flick were high and I must say these were pretty much met. Every show of this movie was sold out in the theatres around here and we finally got some tickets for the last show after 10PM, and it was worth the wait. Some kids may get a little freightened at some scenes, but it's not as brutal as Lord of the Rings, although due to its graphics/characters (the evil ones), it only narrowly passes the PG rating. <br />I must say that I haven't read the book and therefore I had no preconceived ideas. I just know it is a beautiful story about a dragon rider and his dragon who experiences adventures in a fantasy land. For the duration of the flick you can relax and enjoy a fantastic story without thinking of the world's harsh realities. The beauty is that there are no sensual scenes and no bad language. Also, the photography is excellent. It's just a beautiful tale about the good hearted who will prevail through all kinds of obstacles, ... it's a positive film. I think virtually all kids and most adults will enjoy this movie.

B000J103X4|4.0|The Game has been the very face of controversy ever since his 2005 debut THE DOCUMENTARY.  His is very bragadocious, which is apparent through the line \\"it's the muthaf***ing messiah of gangsta rap\\" from the first track of DOCTOR'S ADVOCATE, \\"Looking At You\\". While he is cocky or arrogant, he does have a bit of a right too considering the double platinum success of his debut and the 358,000 copies that THE DOCTOR'S ADVOCATE sold to secure The Game his second number one album, even if it was at the expense of some 230,000 copies (THE DOCUMENTARY sold 587,000 its first week out). He is a quality rapper if nothing else even if you feel the hype is a bit much.  Though honestly, with all the controversy and what controversy does, is it that hard to understand the hype that is surrounding ex-G-Unit rapper The Game.<br /><br />What could be seen as a flaw or maybe not is the fact that THE DOCTOR'S ADVOCATE is an assertion of The Game's greatness and how he could care less about being kicked out of G-Unit or falling out of master producer Dr. Dre's favor.  It is a sticky situation considering that THE DOCUMENTARY'S hits were propelled via Dre's unescapable production work and 50 Cent's songwriting/rapping contributions. Despite this, THE DOCUMENTARY stands on its own and is a 4 star album, just as THE DOCUMENTARY was.<br /><br />Following the forgettable \\"Lookin' At You\\" which serves as nothing more than introlude that \\"opens up the can of worms\\", is the incredible \\"rap-performance of the year\\" worthy \\"Da S***\\" which features exceptional production via a couple of meshed samples.  For not being produced by Dr. Dre, it is quite the hot track. Clocking in at over five minutes, it is a pleasure to listen to it, despite it cocky nature and its extensive length. I think even Dr. Dre would have to commend the game on the production or the hook if nothing else.  \\"It's Okay (One Blood)\\" once again hates on Dr. Dre and the G-Unit camp. Though the repeated lyrics \\"one blood\\" by Junior Reid mixed with the great drum programming makes for the second straight hit in a roll.  The Game slaughters once again.<br /><br />will.i.am helmed \\"Compton\\" proves to be another hit and actually a \\"treat\\" to listen to.  The production is signature will.i.am and works particularly well here with the inescapable sound of syncopated electric piano and slightly overproduced drum programming supporting it.  The hook is incredibly catchy where \\"the place where the gangsta boogie\\" is repeated over and over and easily gets stuck in your head.  \\"Remedy\\" features another yeoman's job by both the Game as well as production work by Just Blaze, whose name The Game drops.  \\"Let's Ride\\" is signature Scott Storch and a very good choice for a second single.  It is yet another hit by the Game.  So, does the Game have a right to brag?  He just might.<br /><br />\\"Too Much\\" features Nate Dogg and it is another strong track.  The hook is catchy and the Game is in his \\"zone\\" so to speak.  \\"Wouldn't Get Far\\" features standout Kanye West as well as production work by West.  It is by no means as good as Kanye West's heavy hitting \\"Dreams\\" from 2005's THE DOCUMENTARY, but it is OK.  The production is good if nothing else, though again not as good as its predecessor.<br /><br />Skipping ahead, DOCTOR'S ADVOCATE features two more true standouts via the great \\"Doctor's Advocate\\" which features Busta Rhymes and  Chauncey Black. It is a very beautiful track, well a beautiful as gangsta rap can be that is!  The sample being used works very well and the vocals during the chorus are great.  The other standout \\"California Vacation\\" features none other than Uncle Snoop and is just as strong as anything else on DOCTOR'S ADVOCATE.

B0000AZKLF|5.0|While Albert King never rose to the massive popularity of Stevie Ray Vaughan, as far as blues players go though, he was one of the more familiar to rock fans, thanks to his work being covered by Clapton and Hendrix (\\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\").<br /><br />  No modern guitarist was more influenced by King than Stevie Ray Vaughan, whose admiration and praise allowed him to share the stage in a Hamilton, Ontario TV studio right around the time of the release of Vaughan's \\"Texas Flood\\".  This summit was long overdue, and is absolutely critical for Vaughan and King fans.<br /><br />  Mind you, there are many rehashes, repackagings and other posthumous releases of SRV, most of which are unforgivable, offering nothing new, only capitalizing on the myth and making a fortune off his memory.<br /><br />\\"In Session\\", however, like \\"The Sky Is Crying\\", is one CD that does offer a fresh look at both masters.<br /><br />  King is still the star of this show, and his band provides the powerful backing music as the two titans trade off solo after solo, each careful to not overplay, but not hide behind their amps, either.<br /><br />  Vaughan sounds a lot like King, showing us the bedrock of his style.  He was a little flashier, and could control feedback ala Hendrix, but when all is said and done, SRV was the best white blues player period.  Brit players like Clapton and Page pale in comparison.<br /><br />  Prime cuts include \\"Pride And Joy\\" as handled by King's band, and it thumps and grinds mightily.  \\"Overall Junction\\" is a King jam and indeed it does.  Perhaps the best is \\"Matchbox Blues\\", with an absolutely wicked swing beat that allows both guitarists to soar, reaching blues nirvana over and over.<br /><br />  SRV fans will delight in this CD when he was probably at his greatest, and will come away King fans as well, after finding out who got this party started in the first place.
B000IJ7MCC|5.0|To be honest, when I think of psychedelic bands I don't usually think of Balkan folk music. But with the release of Beirut's \\"Gulag Orkestar,\\" I may have to revise my thinking.<br /><br />This new band consists of teenage musician Zach Condon, along with people from Neutral Milk Hotel and A Hawk and a Hacksaw, making bittersweet folkpop and danceable marches. Imagine a band of slightly drunk gypsies on parade, and you'll have the general idea of how it sounds.<br /><br />It opens slow, with a gentle piano and blaring horns. The title track meanders in circles and finally dies away... only to be reborn as a swaying march. Halfway through, Condon joins in with some mournful wails and equally mournful singing. That turns around in \\"Prenzluerberg,\\" where the singing is just as melancholy, but the music is a cheerier march.<br /><br />From there on, the trio tries out those styles and everything in between -- rattly folk with tambourines and horns, danceable folkpop, and tinkly klezmer music. Yes, tinkly klezmer. They get downright happy in \\"Scenic World,\\" a colorful glockenspiel song that is just barely grounded by some quick violins.<br /><br />After that, \\"Gulah Orkestar\\" is pretty upbeat, with a string of swaying marches and upbeat folk acoustics. The album's finale is a bit of a head-scratcher, though. \\"After the Curtain\\" is a relatively bare-bones song with Condon singing over applause and a dancing glockenspiel. I don't know how to fit that one in.<br /><br />And this version has an addition: The \\"Lon Gisland\\" EP, which starts off with the bittersweet, playful horn pop \\"Elephant Gun,\\" before slipping off into a ponderous march song, a colourful accordion tune (complete with clacking drumsticks), a sweep of soaring horns, and the delightfully bright \\"Carousels.\\"<br /><br />Basically this album is what happens when an American teenager drops out and crosses Eastern Europe, soaking up the folk music as he goes.<br /><br />And it's a good thing Condon's musical talents are being backed by experienced musicians, so we can get a bittersweet, atmospheric taste of whatever he heard there. The main problem is that the less folky songs don't really fit in -- without them, the album would have been a lot better. But as it is, it's a remarkable achievement.<br /><br />Condon has a pretty deep voice for someone so young, and he fills it with the longing and beauty that traditional singing often has. And he's assisted by some very talented musicians: Jeremy Barnes and Heather Trost, both of whom work in the psych-folk band A Hawk and a Hacksaw. So of course, they have a good ear for this sort of thing.<br /><br />So how do they manage? Soundwise, it's like someone took the gypsy out of Gogol Bordello and slapped it on Neutral Milk Hotel. The songs are brimming with violins, horns, accordion, mandolin, pianos, ukeleles, glockenspiel and many others. These instruments are so smoothly blended that it sounds like at least a dozen people are playing at any one time, and that they've played this music their whole lives.<br /><br />\\"Gulag Orkestar\\" is a pretty, heart-tugging album that will make you think of quaint European villages in the springtime. Definitely worth listening to, many times.ndon's musical talents are being backed by experienced musicians, so we can get a bittersweet, atmospheric taste of whatever he heard there.

B000I5X80G|5.0|Mr. Young, we the fans have waited a long time for a release like this.  Please consider giving us more next time.<br /><br />All that said, this is amazing!  I tried not to buy this but could not resist.
0800141849|4.0|Any Movie that ends with \\"Nessum Dorma\\" is cool - period.  Think of the longing, the sweetness, the power of the song itself and you get some idea of how this movie will kick you in the gut when you least expect it. <br /> <br />Bridges is awesome in his role -- totally unselfconsciousness, completely believable, absolutly wonderful, and Streisand is strong and brave in hers -- so what's not to love? All those who hated it, watch it again.  All of you who haven't seen it, watch it.  If you've got a speck of romance in your soul, and a song in your heart, you'll get it. <br />
B00005JPDS|4.0|Today I went to see the much awaited Pursuit of Happyness.  With the big hype I expected to see a great movie.  Needless to say I was not disappointed; but not blown away.  What kept this movie alive was the warmth and enthusiasm of Will Smith.  Never have I seen him so emotionally involved in his character.  Thinking about each scene there wasn,t one that I can remember without him.  He must have been exhausted.This movie did bring to light what it is like to be broke and homeless.  It was not something that usually happens in such a persons life; to still have a vision. There is a real warmth between Will and his son, who gives a memorable portayal.  Will Smith deserves recognition for his stunning performance.
B00000K3CM|3.0|<br />Watch HOME ALONE (1990) and HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK (1992) on consecutive nights, and you will experience the ultimate deja vu sensation.  The second film is not a sequel, but a remake with an improved screenplay!  Both movies were directed by Chris Columbus and written/produced by John Hughes.  Film one takes place mostly in the Chicago suburbs at Christmas time--and did the production designers ever have a fun time hanging lights all over three story mansions.  The second film takes place in mostly New York City, also at Christmas time.  Both movies have clips from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946)--one in French, the other in Spanish.  And both have the identical clip from the fictional ANGELS WITH FILTHY SOULS that are used for similar purposes--to scare away unwanted people.  Finally, both have young hero Kevin McAllister (amazing Macaulay Culkin) taking on the same two burglars and just about killing them.  One wonders how on earth Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern (and the stunt people) survived the stunts in both films. <br /> <br />The plots are shamelessly similar.  In film one, Kevin is left at home in his family's elegant Chicago suburbs mansion, while everyone else in the family goes to Paris.  Once in Paris, once mom Catherine O'Hara (wonderful) realizes Kevin is alone, she tries to bribe and cajole passengers to be bumped so that she can get back home right away.  But Kevin is having the time of his life alone with ice cream and cheese pizzas--and having a field day fighting off the Laurel and Hardy-like \\"Wet Bandit\\" burglars Pesci and Stern.  Helping him is a next door neighbor everyone is afraid of, Roberts Blossom, who has the film's most poignant scene with Kevin in an empty church on Christmas Eve.  John Candy is also wonderful as a polka king who helps O'Hara get to Chicago from, I think, Milwaukee in his band's van. <br /> <br />Just as the best scenes in HOME ALONE involve a lonely old man and a polka band, and not the burglars, the burglarsare downright irrelevant in LOST IN NEW YORK.  Here the family flies to Miami, leaves Kevin behind in Chicago again, and he ends up alone at the Plaza Hotel with all of Manhattan at Christmas time as his playground.  I like film two much better because of the sublime supporting cast:  Brenda Fricker as a Central Park bird woman, Eddie Bracken as a toy store manager, Tim Curry as a hotel concierge with a grinch smile, and John Schneider as a bellboy who goes crazy with a kid who alternately gives him bubble gum and $50 tips.  (Kevin has his Dad's credit card--up to a point.)  They are so hysterically funny for 90 minutes that it is almost a letdown when burglars Pesci and Stern, still playing \\"The Wet Bandits\\", show up to menace Kevin in an upper Manhattan brownstone for the last half hour of a long 120 minutes.  Again, I found myself cringing at the realistic and nasty violence, more than laughing at its inventiveness.  I found myself really fearing for actors' and stuntpeoples' lives.  I NEVER FOUND IT FUNNY.  But I adored the ending with mom Catherine O'Hara sweetly reunited with Kevin at Rockefeller Center.  (You just knew it would end that way.) <br /> <br />It's Christmas season.  You are busy with your own families and holiday shopping. You have time for one of the first two (there are four total) HOME ALONE movies from John Hughes and Chris Columbus.  Watch film two, LOST IN NEW YORK.  Savor the fabulous supporting cast and the gorgeous color by master cinematographer Julio Macat (who also shot the first film in ravishing deep oranges and greens).  John Williams' score on both films is special, too, as always.  Happy holiday season. <br /> <br />
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a phenomenal read for anyone that has ever questioned the true meaning of life. It denounces America's fascination with greed, emphasizing that all we really need to be fulfilled is love. As a Hospice Volunteer worker, I found this book especially endearing. The dying have so much to offer us, yet we alienate them because we are afraid of our own mortality. I always recommend this book to fellow volunteers and patients alike, and everyone is always moved by it.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|I've been a big fan of Loreena for almost a decade now and for anyone unfamiliar with her sonic territory, be assured you will find just about everything splendid about her in this single CD: her porcelain vocals, fluid composition, Eastern/Mid-Eastern/Celtic instrumentation, and sincere passion for the tales and experiences she channels.  Consider An Ancient Muse to be a bona fide coda for Loreena's career.  There lies both its greatest strength and its faults.     As others have mentioned, several songs echo of inadvertent or deliberate homage to earlier iterations of her musical ideas, including The Bonny Swans (Beneath a Phrygian Sky), The Old Ways (Caravanserai), The Lady of Shallot (The English Ladye and the Knight), Marco Polo (Kecharitomene), and others.  As such, listening to this album gives you a pretty comprehensive feel for where Loreena has been in her 20+ year journey that would be difficult to achieve with any other single CD on its own.  However, it goes no further than that and brings old fans no unique experiences we haven't already enjoyed.  And quite frankly, her earlier treads were more impressive not only because they were then original but because they were also significantly more sophisticated from a melodic and harmonic standpoint.  Loreena relies too much on her arresting voice here (which is without a doubt splendid) and her solid understanding of basic composition.  But she rarely goes beyond basic, using simplistic motives and chord progressions that she's recylced several times over.  For the untrained harmonic ear, this may not be problematic.  But her melodies, soaring as they may be, could benefit from some complexity and certainly some variation.  For instance, the strongest and most original melody here is in the verse section of Caravanserai, which is incidentally the album's strongest track.  The song's sole flaw is that it fumbles the dynamic upon reaching the (hate to say it) mundane chorus.  It doesn't ruin the song as a whole, but merely leaves the listener imagining what a marvel it could have otherwise been had it been fully realized.  Similarly, Beneath a Phrygian Sky suffers for want of musical variation.  Here, the melody is repeated throughout the entire song without a separate section (no chorus, rise, or bridge) leaving what could have been a career defining track as a mere pleasant sounding glimpse of unfulfilled potential.  Some more musical sections, melodic variation, syncopation, alternating chord progressions, or even (gasp) a key change would do wonders here, both on the album as a whole but on this track particularly.  Loreena has so much going for her that some attention to musical detail would really round out her work.  While her lyrics have sustained a level of high quality, possibly even improved, and her voice is as impeccable as ever, her composition skills have remained stagnant or even slightly devolved.     As others mentioned, the instrumentation here breaks no new ground but gets the job done.  Despite boasting an unprecedented diversity of new and exotic instruments (and I do love the guitar in Beneath a Phrygian Sky), the overall sound is nearly identical to that found on The Book of Secrets.  The difference is that it's a bit sparser, less uptempo, and oddly enough sounds more homogenous than its predecessor (no conspicuous harp, as in La Serenissima or pan flute as in Skellig).  Given that the tracks on her previous album were a bit more dramatic and musically daring, and these new tracks simply retain rather than build upon the prior's style, one might even be initially tempted to believe that the Ancient Muse is a collection of Book of Secrets B-sides, demos, and outtakes.  However, a few subsequent listens to Caravanserai, the superbly voiced English Ladye and the Knight, and the unique Sacred Shabbat puts those fears to rest.    Overall, this album contains and represents all of the elements that have come to signify the best of Loreena: esoteric musings, deep introspection and respect for human culture, exotic instrumentation, a gorgeous voice, and a spectacular cast of supporting musicians.  However, while it showcases in many ways all of her best features and influences, it is far from her best work and contains no real standout track(s) like her three most popular albums.  Thus it serves as a very candid introduction to Loreena McKennitt but longtime fans looking for the next Mystic's Dream, The Old Ways, The Highwayman, The Mummer's Dance, or The Two Trees will be mildly disappointed.  Some more innovation and musical audacity would greatly benefit her next project.  Nevertheless, An Ancient Muse is good effort overall and a worthwhile addition to any fan's collection and its flaws do not detract from the truth that after nine absent years, it's good to hear from this magnificent woman again.  Looking forward to the next journey.
0694003611|5.0|Part of the joy of this classic is letting the child participate in the story. After reading it a few times, your child will love to \\"read\\" it to you by pointing to the pictures, anticipating what you will say, etc. It is not only a relaxing story, but it is also a story to help with language skills, sequencing, and memory skills. Point out how the room becomes darker. Make the most of the illustrations as well as the text. It is more than just a book. It is an experience to share.
0451191153|3.0|Ayn Rand doesn't immediately present the philosophy she opposes as something only an idiot would agree with. \\"Collectivist\\" philosophy was given adequate counsel in Ellsworth Toohey. Most of his arguments didn't display obvious logical oversights as would be expected from a typical manipulative villain character. This is the kind of methodical restraint that allows her ideas to unfold in such an engaging, stimulating way. The broad strokes of the book are brilliant, however the detail is often incomprehensible. The mysticism of the unspoken understandings between characters seems at odds with the cold reality the book is grounded in and the further you get through the book the more the characters allude to their unspecified understandings. By the last 200 pages I saw no consistency left in any of the characters and only kept reading to get it over with.
B0000025QC|5.0|There is a woman and a man's voice at the beginning of \\"Caverna Magica\\".  The voice is actually being played backwards so if you play this song in reverse (which is not hard to do since the standard \\"Sound Recorder\\" that comes with Windows allows you to play a .wav file in reverse) you can try to make out what is being said.  I presume the speech is in a Scandinavian language, although at one point, you can clearly hear her say \\"Caverna Magica\\".  Can someone decipher the full message?
B000784WMW|5.0|But I will affirm what others say--this version of JE is the closest to the novel and is truest to the language (and to me, the feeling) of the original. I am well aware the axes will be sharpened for me saying this, what with the BBC's lovely 2006 adaptation on the scene. 2006 JE *is* lovely--the leads are wonderful--but IMO Dalton has fully embraced the darkness of ER whereas Toby Stevens comes across as a likeable guy that's already looking for redemption when he returns home. TD's ER is lost in corruption and is therefore doubly surprised by finding the light in the \\"plain, Quakerish\\" governess. I also think that ZC's Jane is much more the spiritual, otherworldly \\"fairy\\" being of the novel--and in this adaptation, she gets all her rightfully piquant lines.
B000001F3C|5.0|Well, either that or The Joshua Tree. This is a must-have for any self-respecting fan of the group. Everybody knows the cathariatic protest Sunday Bloody Sunday, a driving antiwar song and a true classic. Even better (to me, anyway) is New Year's Day, the album's other big hit - unforgettable indeed. You don't hear much about Seconds, Like a Song..., Two Hearts Beat As One, Red Light or the vaguely Talking Heads-esque Refugee, but they're all as good as the hits, and Bono's vocals are at their peak. Drowning Man is filler, but overall War is one of U2's greatest albums.
B00068CVJ4|5.0|Before Cedric and Omar were pushing the boundaries of music nearly to the extremes in the Mars Volta, they were blowing minds in At the Drive-in.  To categorize their music is nearly impossible.  They've most commonly been labeled as \\"punk\\", but that's hardly even scratching the surface.  Truth be told, this is a sound that was nearly unique unto itself.  The closest comparsion one could perhaps make is Fugazi, but even that is misleading.  Either way, you're probably not going to be prepared for this on the first listen.<br /><br />Now, since the Mars Volta have gotten fairly popular these days, especially among fans of progressive rock, I suppose it'd be fair to make the comparison.  While TMV fit somewhat into the prog category, with their huge epic compositions and technically audacious musicianship, I would not quite put ATDI into this same category, at least not quite as squarely.  While the music here is highly sophisticated, experimental, and unpredictable, it doesn't really achieve what most would call a \\"prog\\" aesthetic.  The songs generally aren't that long, and the musicianship is much more closely rooted to the song itself.  However, it's not to say that this is necessarily more straight-forward.  If you love the explosive oddness of TMV, then you'll most assuredly love this as well.<br /><br />Describing the songs is basically useless.  From one second to the next, this album takes you on a thrilling journey of pure alien madness.  From the raw psychosis of \\"Arcarsenal\\" to the spacious atmospheres of \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\", this is definitely an album of extremes.  But, even in its softer and more tranquil moments, it never gets particularly \\"normal\\".  Songs like \\"One Armed Scissor\\", \\"Pattern Against User\\", and \\"Rolodex Propaganda\\" are surprisingly catchy, but are still far from being tailor-made radio hits.  The album ends appropriately enough with the powerful rocker \\"Catacombs\\", which finally culminates with a finale of electronic beeping.  At the end, you get the same sensation of having your brain removed, rearranged, and shoved back into place as you do with the Mars Volta, but much more focused and compact.<br /><br />The point is, you need this album.  Anyone who enjoys original, bizarre, daring music simply can't be without this.  And, if you like TMV, but perhaps think they're a bit too excessive musically, you'll really love this.  But either way, this is essential.he end, you get the same sensation of having your brain removed, rearranged, and shoved back into place as you do with the Mars Volta, but much more focused and compact. <br /> <br />The point is, you need this album.

B0007MAO0M|5.0|An unbelievable cast, a great story, amazing cinematography, a soundtrack worthy of Aaron Copeland, action, drama, comedy:  this movie has it all.  I would put this movie up against anything short of a small handful of classic westerns such as the Magnificent Seven.
B00005JPCC|4.0|It is appropriate that \\"Casino Royale\\", the first of the James Bond books (1953), would also be the first James Bond film to get a makeover. The original 1967 film was not just the black sheep of the series, but a bizarre departure from pretty much everything the franchise stood for. Which made it the best candidate for a remake which itself drastically breaks away from many Bond film conventions.     The new \\"Casino Royale\\" represents a welcome invigoration of a series at a crossroads where it either had to reinvent itself or retire. As the least elaborate and most basic of Ian Fleming's series, the story adapts well to a gritty no-nonsense treatment. Basically it is the origin story of 007 and Daniel Craig, doing a reprise of his performance in \\"Layer Cake\\", steps in as the new (and the most like Fleming's original) Bond. He is more out-of-control dashing than suave and sophisticated.  While the young James Bond is immature and overconfident, he comes by these traits honestly being both a very competent and a very maladjusted young man. Which means a mean streak and a soft side unlike any Bond before him.     Unlike the sound stage sets of the original \\"Casino Royale\\", the remake makes extensive use of exotic location shooting. The events in the films and the book center around a high stakes game (Texas hold-em poker here-baccarat in the others) as the villain Le Chiffre attempts to add funds to his agency's treasury at the gaming tables (the present day setting of the film requires the insertion of terrorist connections).     For longtime fans of the franchise, Casino Royale offers some retro kicks. The film nicely blends virtuoso action sequences with sexy romance; and throws in a torture sequence more in the tradition of \\"The Ipcress Files\\" than \\"Goldfinger.    This is serious stuff, not the self-parody and cartoonish antics which had begun to dominate the productions even before the Brosnan era. At first the new direction might seem a considerable gamble, butwhile there was no guarantee of success the producers had little to lose except production costs because the franchise was so close to fading away. Something rugged and unconventional was needed and that is exactly what the new \\"Casino Royale\\" delivers.  The gritty opening scenes (featuring desaturated images) flashback to Bond as he is earning his 007 designation with brutal assassinations in a public bathroom and office. No silly gadgets (at least not really silly) or \\"Man From UNCLE\\" quips. There is a gray Aston Martin and the best car chase in Bond film history.     The new Le Chiffre is no Orsen Welles; and must rely on a bleeding non-functional eye for his creepiness. The interplay between Bond and Vesper Lynds (Eva Green) works quite well.     The writing team of Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis provide a particularly nice script and it is fair to say that this version of \\"Casino Royale\\" ranks up there with the best of the series.     Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

B00026WU4G|4.0|I like this album a lot. It's not perfect, but who cares? There's good stuff on this album, and lots of it. Jokerman and Sweetheart Like You are widely considered to be the high points of the album, and you won't hear any argument from me; the pro-Israel Neighborhood Bully (all-too-obvious lyrics aside, it's a rockin' tune); I And I and especially Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight (the latter being my second-favorite on the album, behind Jokerman) are lesser-known, but might end up on your Dylan favorites list sometimes. Union Sundown; License to Kill and Man of Peace are fillers, but can be ignored, and Bob's voice is arguably at its peak. Shame nobody thought of adding Blind Willie McTell, Dylan's best song of the '80's, because that would've made this album even better.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Ennis whispers \\"Jack I swear...\\" at the end. Should have taken best picture hands down.
B00005JLO2|3.0|Visually \\"The Four Feathers\\" is a gorgeous film; but nonstop action is so heavily emphasized at the expense of plot and character development, that the film makes almost no sense.     I could almost take it on faith that the focal character, Harry what's-his-name, might impulsively flee to the Sudan in an attempt to redeem his honor and help his former fellow officers and friends. However, it was never at any point clear what his overall plan was for helping them, or even if he ever had any. In one scene an Arab go-between tells Harry he needs to learn Arabic; and Harry apparently instantly and effortlessly learns enough Arabic, as well as enough about local culture, to pass as a Bedouin among both native peoples and the British. Worst of all, Harry and other characters are repeatedly abandoned in the most barren desert; and except for one instance (where they also get help from a native), with no transportation except their feet, no food or water, no guide, and no map, and usually when they're in bad physical shape to start with--yet somehow they always survive. Added to many other improbabilities, all this strains credibility too far, even for an action film.    It's a shame, because with a slower pace and more character development, this could have been an intriguing and much more subtle film. The theme is very much male love and comradeship--Harry's fiancee Ethne doesn't matter to him nearly as much as his male friends. So, when Harry's friend Jack announces to that same group of friends that he (Jack) is also getting engaged, and one of those friends congratulates Jack with pain and great reluctance--well, a modern viewer can't help but wonder exactly _how_ intimate these man-to-man relationships are.     Then there's Harry's cultural identity. There is a period when he is impressed into almost-slavery by a British regiment (to whom, for unexplained reasons, he has not revealed his true identity). The soldiers crack whips, and Harry and natives of various racesspend days laboriously struggling to move the British baggage vehicles, etc. through the desert as fast as possible. Seeing the worst side of colonization, does Harry ever gain sympathy for the natives and lose sympathy for the British cause? Then there's Harry's incredibly faithful native sidekick, whose name I've forgotten. The native's deep devotion to Harry is owing to his even deeper devotion to Mohammedism; Allah has told him to protect Harry. Does Mohammedism ever look more appealing to Jack than the Church of England?     In other words, why doesn't Harry just chuck the whole British cause and go native? After all, there's \\"nothing left for him at home.\\" His relationships with his father and his fiancee seem destroyed, his army career is over, he has no money and no prospects.     Logical as all these questions seem, \\"The Four Feathers\\" not only does not answer them, it doesn't even acknowledge that they exist.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|Yet another beautiful album from the amazing singer/songwriter. His lyrics and vocals are breathtaking. There are many great songs on this album, but, my personal favorite is \\"accidental babies\\".

B000000H5K|5.0|Deff my fav Sepultura album. It runs just ahead of Beneath the remains for me a death and thrash classic by the way. This was the last album they made with Max in the band and after this album the band starts to go down hill a lil but not as much as some ppl like to claim. This is deff their most exerimental work, combining their native Brazilian rhtyms and tribal drums even more than on Chaos AD another classic of 90's metal. Many ppl prefer Chaos AD over this album however both are most certainly priceless additions to any Metal collection and must owns of any Sepultura collection. They created a very uniqe sound Tribal Metal a new genre of metal that few besides Sepultura and Soulfly Max's band after leaving Sepultura have ever jumped into it mainly because of the knowledge required of Tribal drums in order to play it. Bloody Roots, Attitude, Ratamahatta and Dusted are the best songs of this album. Warning its not traditional metal however its most certainly metal and very heavy too. It showcases some of the best vocal work by Max maybe only second to his stuff on Chaos AD or Dark Ages with Soulfly and deff Igor's best drumming ever. Showing that you dont need to hit your kick drums twice a second or drill out blast beats to be a good drummer. He uses a uniqe style of rhythmic drumming found in few other bands today especially in Metal. Pick it up its most certainly a great album and one that I guarantee will not disapoint you.

B000BVRWJA|5.0|Just got this watch today and it is very nice.  It is large and thick.  I have a very small wrist (about 6 1/4\\") and was afraid this would be too much watch for a thin guy like me.  You should go see this watch in person before buying it.  The pictures do NOT do this watch justice.  It is a hundred times nicer in person.  I was trying to decide between this watch and the PR50 chrono and this watch is on a different level.  The quality is outstanding.  I have a girlfriend who is not afraid to tell me I look silly and she does not think this watch is too big on me.  She likes it very much.  I've only had this watch for a day and may or may not add more to this review in the future.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|Hello,    I remember as a young man loving Superman I  and when II came out it was well received but there was a new director?  I had read so many places that they were filmed at the same time...why was a different directors name on it?  That of course was before the information age and a hundred ET type shows etc and the net which would have blasted it all over creation...  it was just an ugly little power play of the Salkinds...who should be selling pet rocks instead of making movies!  The man who undertook the massive job (Richard Donner) was unceremoniously fired after doing much of the job...and shame on the Salkinds who seem to make ALL decisions based on greed and profit. Richard Lester should have NEVER taken on the job if he was an honorable professional and should have NEVER taken full director credit....but he's a Salkind slut.  I always wondered why the last bit of off camera dialog by Gene Hackman was dubbed and not him...well..Ned Beatty and Gene Hackman never shot a foot of film with LESTER...good for them...and Tom Mankiewicz also refused to stay on board.    so...we never got to see the original II...and you still won't by viewing this DVD....scenes weren't shot...one was available as a screentest...so this is more of an outline/work in progress..version of what II would have been if Donner had not been dumped by the peddlers Salkind.  Its still fun to have the commentary and stories about all this..and some of the missing/restored scenes are WONDERFUL!  I think Mr Mankiewicz's commment that they had done all the \\"legend Of\\" stuff in the first movie and it was time to have some fun...is even more heart breaking in that he and Mr Donner didn't get the chance to finish and even more sad to continue the franchise ....because the money men....figured with a HIT movie he was dispensible and sadly...for their purpose they were right.    Mr Donners affection for the story and the actors and artists who did this mammouth job comes through in the commentaryas does his love for Mr Reeve.    I hope this movie is terribly successful for him and Christopher Reeve. I hate it that the Salkinds will still profit more than him financially even from this reconstruction...but I'm not suprised and he's done allright in the intervening years.    Don't expect to see what would have been had Donner not been fired...its impossible to make that....expect a different twist, a bit more footage and a TON more HEART!    oh...and if you want to see what Richard Lester would do ...on his own?  check out Superman III...nuff said!
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Ralph Macchio (\\"My Cousin Vinny\\") stars in the first three \\"Karate Kid\\" movies, directed by John G. Avlidsen (\\"Rocky\\"; he directed the first three movies). Pat Morita (who won Best Supporting Actor for the first movie) stars in all four.<br /><br />The first movie is a lot of fun, with the famous \\"Wax on, wax off\\" sequence. It is also the film debut of Elizabeth Shue. I loved the romantic subplot. The fight seequences are well-executed.<br /><br />The second film starts going into dark territory, beginning with the aftermath of the competition that concludes the first film. Why Elizabeth Shue didn't return is a mystery to me, though I loved the new interest. Once again, the action scenes were top-notch. I love the song \\"Glory Of Love.\\"<br /><br />The third movie is easily the darkest in the entire series. Cleverly edited clips from the first two movies serve as the prologue to this<br /><br />\\"Revenge Of The Sith\\"-style installment. The best one yet. They keep getting better and better. The acting in all three is awesome.<br /><br />The fourth movie was a let-down, despite a break-out performance by Hilary Swank (who would later win two Best Actress Oscars for \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" and the Clint Eastwood-directed drama \\"Million Dollar Baby\\") and another strong performance from Morita. The direction was God-awful. (John G. Avlidsen didn't direct; I don't know why). The script, which was not written by Robert Mark Kamen (who created the character and wrote the scripts for the first three hits), lacks the empathy and emotional punch of the first three, though no fault of Ms. Swank. All three movies are rated PG for some violence and mild language.

Those are surely not so theatrical Steinman compositions (though the former off the aborted BATMAN on broadway project)...they rock hard!

156224003X|4.0|An interesting review of what it takes to become expert at a subject.  The meditations can are a little hokey, but the ideas are sound.  Definitely food for thought.
0618680004|2.0|`The God Delusion' is aimed at a popular audience.  Given this, Dawkins might be excused from rigorous standards of argument, and allowed a dose of rhetoric.  Even so, the book is inconsistent, if not overtly misleading, as to its aims and intentions.  While Dawkins postures towards a comprehensive rebuttal of all `supernatural' religious beliefs, his actual target is far more specific: the proponents of creationism.  Included here are the synonymous ideas of intelligent design and irreducible complexity.  As these opponents operate largely from the USA, he aims much of his rhetoric against his perceptions of this country's intellectual climate.<br /><br />*<br /><br />Dawkins is not an historian of ideas.  However, he does not advertise this fact.  Instead he characterises debates as if their history did not exist or is irrelevant.  What's more, he colours his characterisation to suit his own purposes.  All this is fine if the book is taken as rhetoric, as a polemic against creationism.  It's not so great if you're hoping to gain an understanding of the various intellectual and devotional positions available, and an overview of how they have developed and clashed (or interacted)  with each other.<br /><br />*<br /><br />He is at pains to diffentiate belief in a non-personal God, who does not actively intevene in human affairs, with that of a personal God, who responds to human communications and intervenes physically upon the world.  The former he views as benign, and, at least implicitly, compatible with a scientific world view; this is the God of Einstein, Spinoza, Sir Isaac Newton, among others.  The latter he sees as inevitably treading upon the domain of science, in that this God is said to answer prayers, perform willed miracles, and to have literally created the world in seven days - all these claims being open to scientific investigation and refutation.  His argument is with this latter personal God, that is the God of creationists.  He is not interested infurther mapping the detail of the various conceptions of God available; these two will do.<br /><br />*<br /><br />He is also less interested in moral issues than one might think.  His examination of the problem of evil, or of God's justice (theodicy), is cursory, and largely involves mocking literal interpretations of events in the Judeo-Christian Bible.  Personally, while I am not a believer, I found his approach condescending and ultimately dull; Dawkins' writing style is often awkward, and his sense of humour unsophisticated; he structures chapters in a confused manner, and the premisses of his argument are buried, or deliberately hidden, from view; his narcissism can be nauseating.  If you are genuinely interested in these ideas I would suggest Leszek Kolakowski's book, \\"Religion, If There is No God...On God, the Devil, Sin and Other Worries of the So-Called Philosophy of Religion\\" - despite its convoluted title, this book is a model of clarity, especially granted the complexity of its topic; Kolakowski's breadth of knowledge on these matters exceeds Dawkins' by an order of magnitude.<br /><br />*<br /><br />Overall, if you want to hear the bile of an opponent of creationism for nigh 400 pages, then this is the book for you.  For a comprehensive exploration of issues concerning belief in God, however, look elsewhere.
B00005JNEW|5.0|What an exceptional film. If I could give it more than five stars I gladly would. When I first saw this film in 04', I must admit that I didn't understand what all the buzz was about. However, I watched the film again recently, and was completely moved. As a sports enthusiast, this team is the absolute apotheosis of team. From its coaches to its players, all the way down to its community. The spirit of Permian High School and \\"Mojo\\" football is palpable when one watches this film. From the very beginning of the film , to the very end. I promise you that you will enjoy this film as much as I. I still find myself cheering, and I still find a tear in my eye. The end result. A masterpiece of a film made with absolute teutonic craftsmanship. My heart too is full, and I have become a Mojo fan for life. GO MOJO!!!!!

B00005JPB4|5.0|For all the negative responses to the movie \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" I would guess 85% did not read the book with the same title by James Bradley, son of John \\"Doc\\" Bradley. This book will give you the whole, true story of what the movie is all about with many details not shown in the film. You will get so much more out of the movie. I can't even fathom seeing the film beforehand.  I am absolutely NOT soliciting the book but I am personally acquainted with the Bradley family and my extended family from Antigo, Wisconsin were very good friends with John and continue to be with his wife Betty. My cousins went to school with James and his siblings. John was the funeral director for my grandmother and others I know. I have attended memorials for \\"Jack\\" in Appleton, WI (where he went to school), after the book was released.  Jim Bradley, the author of \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" agonized over writing the book and consulted with his family whether to do it until he got the go ahead from his mother. Since his father only spoke of the war once to his family is the reason, in the movie, there isn't much personal information on him.  People who wrote other reviews stated that they were confused as to why James was interviewing other WWII, Iwo Jima families. This is why.  As for the other \\"stars\\" of the movie, which very little is said about their personal lives before and then again after the war you will find many details in the book which will help you to understand what lies beneath each personality. I cried when I read the book and I cried when I saw the movie. PLEASE read the book first, or if you've already seen the movie before reading the book, read it and then go back and see the movie again!
B0002STNQ2|3.0|There are some really terrifying scenes in \\"Prey,\\" such as when a character is creeping in the desert as the swarm gathers, having not noticed an intruder yet. But two things bothered me: The characters seemed to behave oddly, completely oblivious to the dangers, like a teenager going upstairs in a horror movie. You want to just keep screaming, \\"Don't do up there!\\" You'd think these brainy people in Crichton's book would be smarter about self-preservation. The other thing I didn't like was that the plot felt formulaic. I knew where it was going. Each scenes generally worked for me, but as a whole it didn't hold up. The scenes meant to chill, did that; the information, true to Crichton, was interesting and well researched. I'm not sorry I read it, but I wish it had more twists and the characters had been smarter.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Another terrific CD that hits right on.  Sometimes when I listen to new music it takes awhile for songs to \\"grow\\" on me, but not this CD--every single song had the beat, the words, right on target!  I hope she never gets discouraged by lack of recognition in the U.S. because it would be so sad to lose this talent.
B000HBK3MM|3.0|I heard her on the radio and loved the song that played.<br /><br />After listening to the cd I found there to be only one<br /><br />or two good songs, all of the rests sounded the same.
B000I2JKFG|1.0|If you are a conservative Sean Hannity watching American troop supporting lover of a free and moral and decent society, you will be climbing the walls of your home theater in the same anxiety as men trying to flee the theater from Madonna's portrayal of Evita while the women forced their husbands to stay because of Antonio Banderas (from personal experience). Yes this movie has a vendetta, it is to place all the blame of terroristic acts on a decent and civil society. I cannot imagine a movie that is more of a crime against humanity and a plea for insanity and lawlessness than this one. I'm not going to say avoid this movie, I would say go see it if you are inclined to for what it really is which is Hollywood's secular humanistic pull for placing the blame of the 9/11 attacks on a western capitalist society. This movie was absolutely nauseating.
B000002P7R|4.0|After Electric Ladyland, this is probably the Hendrix CD that I enjoy the most (I am only missing a few scattered studio releases). While it doesn't hold together as an album, being a compilation, it contains a lot of really incredible songs. The production throughout is fantastic, punchy and clear. Many of these tunes were unfinished studio projects post-Electric Ladyland, and as such a lot of them are very dense and complicated productions. Plentiful guitar overdubs abound, and some of Jimi's most memorable solo playing can be found here as well. Overall, these songs find Hendrix on a serious soul/funk tip, with a lot of very bassy, solid grooves and rhythmic composition. Suffice to say, this makes for great head-nodding material, and when you toss a crazy wah solo on top of it all its pure aural bliss.  <br /> <br />I have always percieved the nutty, freaked-out \\"The Stars that Play With Laughing Sam's Dice\\" as the halfway point, dividing a distinct first and second half to the album. The first half is just beautiful, and rocks straight through, from the manic blues-rock of \\"Look Over Yonder\\" to the unbelievable funk/fusion of \\"Power of Soul\\"; an incredibly complex tune, with a 2 1/2 minute intro that is a hugely intricate sequence of call-and-response riffs over this monstrous Buddy Miles funk beat. This whole song is one my all-time favorites of Hendrix', and it's very different stylistically from much of his other work. The second half of the cd is more diverse, containing a lot of the unfinished and alternate take cuts. This makes for more interesting listening to a Hendrix fan, but is not quite as satisfying. Highlights include the mellow, hyptnotic instrumental \\"Pali Gap\\", a very early drum-machine driven prototype of \\"Angel\\", and an interesting alternate take of \\"All Along the Watchtower\\". Also worth noting is the other Dylan cover, \\"Drifter's Escape\\", which has a lot of the same energy as Watchtower. The CD wraps up with a rare solo performance of Hendrixsitting in a chair playing the blues. As is the case with such b-side material, its not the greatest performance, but the intimacy of the recording is such that you can hear him tapping his foot on the floor. A great compilation, recommended for any rock fan and essential to any Hendrix collection.
B00001OH7O|5.0|The albums from Bowie's long golden era defy description. This is the second album from that golden era (first being Man Who Sold the World). There's just no way to explain, at least not without writing an entire book, how amazing this album is... I won't even try. Just buy it and prepare to be amazed... you will be increasingly amazed as you hear his other masterpieces and marvel at how creative and diverse the work of one man, an incomparable genius, can be. This album is one of the peaks of human artistic achievement.
B000JJRIO8|5.0|This is an excellent album. again is the best album ive heard in a long time. definatley top 3 for '06. and to everyone who thinks Afeni is useing her sons name to make money, you are all lame. just look at all the things shes trying to accomplish with 2pacs legacy.  Every song on this album is great. each has their own strenghts, just like all his other albums. after all it is 2pac, who is undisputedly the BEST rapper who will have ever graced this planet.Afeni and all other producers did an excellent job. if your hatin on anything pac you were never a real fan. and why would you tell people to buy bootleg pac stuff, now that doesnt sound like something a real fan would say. you clwns need to shut up and pay some respect.   RIP Pac
B000J103X4|4.0|After getting the release date pushed back on several instances after all the business tie-ups and all, The Game's sophomore album finally was set to release in early November.  The Doctor's Advocate had a lot of people's attention to see how the Game would do on his second effort, this time no Dr. Dre to help with the production and no 50 Cent (Thank goodness!) on featured songs and hooks, although have to admit the songs he appeared on were tight on The Documentary.  So, Game had to go at it on his own on this go-round.  After grabbing the album on the first day and giving it some listens, you could tell (at least in my view) that this CD was not as good as The Documentary.  There was just something missing to me.  That something was that help from the Doc.  But that might be what helps Game in the end as he does put out a very strong CD with this one. <br /> <br />He might have not gotten production and mixing from the man who put him on, but he does manage to put together some of hip hop's other great and hot producers such as Just Blaze, Scott Storch, Swizz Beatz and Kanye to name a few.  His lyrical ability might be shown to be greater even more with this album actually, except the few too many references to Dr. Dre and the bold comparisons of being as great as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Big and Cube.  He does have the potential to plant his status there in due time, but I do not believe he's there yet even though he is one of favorite rappers right now in a few that I do listen to.  Those guys built their status over time in being hip hop's all-time elite.  Game can't expect to do it with just two CDS.  He has to consistently do it over time.  Anyways as I said, his lyrical wordplay and ability seemed to have grown even more as well as his ability to talk about some real things like the problems success can bring (which can get played out at point, but it's something that happens too often and everyone in a rap has their own view of it).  Songs like One Night gets intolost relationships with homies after they turn more into leeches feeding off the success of his career, which kind of lends itself to an old Babyface chorus.  Wouldn't Get Far is one of my favorites, produced by Kanye who was featured on there as well, as it gets into another bad side of the game in females who try to get their meal ticket and to be seen by messing with every rap star they see.  As good and appealing as some of these females look, everyday girls or video vixens, they can be traps just as quickly cause most are just scandalous and out to hook you for the loot.  That's a lesson most of these dudes have yet to figure out or just don't care at first, but feel that wrath thereafter.  Another favorite of mine is the self-titled track Doctor's Advocate, which features Busta Rhymes.  It is poignant track which Game opens and spills his heart out on the table about his relationship with his mentor and former producer, of course Dr. Dre.  He gets into saying that he is not mad at him, but will forever by thankful and have love for him for how he took him in like and little brother or son and put him on in the game.  The last track of the album with production by Just Blaze being called Why You Hate The Game, with Nas making an appearance along with Marsha Ambrosius from Floetry on the hook.  The track is nine minutes, but it is aimed to be an uplifting track as it features choir vocals in the background and Game in this track looking more like a force to try and unite rap instead of ripping it up with beef.  Blown away by this track!  He still has has club bangers as well like Let's Ride and some other quality tracks in Ol' English, Scream On 'Em, Lookin' At U and One Blood to name a few.  There were a couple tracks that I couldn't really get with, namely tracks 14 and 15 and track 2 was just alright to me.  On Documentary, I could really listen to the WHOLE album.  Not on this one, so I had to take this one down a level. <br /> <br />In some ways, the Gamereally stepped up a notch.  And other ways, he may have faltered.  But that is the way things go when you venture out on your on.  All the moves you make will not end up in being the right one at that point or lead straight to success.  But it all adds up in the end.  Even though this album was not as great as the borderline-classic Documentary, he still stood strong in coming out with another strong effort.  It was like I got into early in this review, he maybe could have Dr. Dre on this album to match or surpass what he did last time.  But going on his own, he is able to find his own identity instead of forever people thinking that Dr. Dre is the REAL reason for his success or having people forever shape your image through the Doc.  Like a father has to let his son go at some point or an older brother has to let the little brother find his own way, so did Dr. Dre do for Game.  Only he did it a little quicker than other instances in life.  He must believed enough in the Game to think he could do it by himself in being a talented rapper, as well of course not wanting to get involved in the on-going beef.  But cutting away as he did will only help the Game as long as he stays around.  It took me awhile to come to this conclusion after hearing this album a lot and a lot of thinking.  As good as this album was and could have been, I expect him to excel even further on his next cut.  But for now, very good album to see the path he is taking in his career and life.

0618680004|3.0|While I agree with the message, I personally find the writing style to be overly cumbersome.    If the point is to preach to the converted, then this book is fine as most of us will read the entire book  regardless .  However, if I  were someone who did not already agree with the message, then I might find myself far less inclined to continue reading.  For this reason, I think the book fails to reach its true potential.
B00006AW2J|1.0|I really despise this overrated band who are the worst band ever THE ROLLING STONES. They are huge posers and all their albums awful and they suck.<br /><br />Mick Thornten is a huge joke of a lead singer, just cant sing, screams, uses make up, and does drugs.<br /><br />Kieth Richmond is what I call the worst guitar player in the world,ever! He never took guitar lessons,his guitar is funky,always out of tune,can't play guitar,and his strings break on his guitar. He cant even fix his guitar.<br /><br />Willie Whatts is the worst drummer in the world. He can't play drums and he never took lessons. What an idiot!<br /><br />Sympathy for the DEVIL is the worst most idiotic song ever recorded by anyone in the industry of music.<br /><br />This Stones album is as bad as Sticky Fingers.<br /><br />Go buy a Bon Jovi CD, huh!<br /><br />Bon Jovi was better.<br /><br />The Stones are terrible.<br /><br />One more thing<br /><br />They are junk.<br /><br />Adios Amergos
B000JJS8TM|5.0|As a long time Beatles fanatic (really, was there ANY music written after they broke up?)  I love this CD.  It probably won't mean much to anyone who wasn't around to experience the original recordings when they first came out, but as I probably know every guitar riff, backwards tape snippet, and vocal uttering on every original album, hearing them reorganized and given new life here is facinating to me.   I'm even hearing things I never heard before.  And some of the new arrangements, I wonder why they didn't do that the first time around . . . If this is your first Beatles album, don't spend the money or the time.  But for us over-50s who grew up with the band, this is great stuff.
0684824906|5.0|Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin.  This is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. It is extremely readable. Doris Kearns Goodwin has written a book that is alive. It is a work for the ages that may well earn Doris Kearns Goodwin another Pulitzer Prize in History.<br /><br />It is a book that is the story of five personalities.  It is like a giant drama. The future of the United States is at stake. The stories of Illinois' Abraham Lincoln, New York's William H. Seward, Ohio's Salmon P. Chase and Edwin Stanton, Pennsylvania's Simon Cameron and Missouri's Edward Bates fill the pages of this wonderful book. The book gives back ground on the lives of all the men.<br /><br />It gives use the story of the civil war from inside the cabinet and White House. I personally found interesting learning of Lincoln spending hours at the telegraph office in trhe evenings talking to his generals via the telegraph. Team of Rivals is worth the purchase price. No matter how many books you have read on Abraham Lincoln or the civil war, your education is incomplete until you read Team of Rivals. The book is a must for every personal, public, and educational institution library.<br /><br />Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Kepler.
B000FQVY2C|3.0|I know I'm going to get a lot of unhelpful marks, but with the invariably perfect reviews this record is getting, I thought I should speak up.  I've tried pretty hard to enjoy this CD, what with paying money for it and all, but I just don't get it.  Sure, the songs are pretty, but also repetitive and somewhat bland.  This isn't helped by the incredibly murky mix this album has.  I was hoping the bonus tracks would provide a clearer picture of what the songs sound like, but they sound the same for the most part.<br /><br />The problem is that I got this along with Vintage Violence, his first solo album.  I love that one.  It has a great energy to it that makes the softer tracks more engaging as well as a mix that is loud and clear.  Though I can easily see Paris 1919 as a good rainy day depression disc, its hard to take most of the songs seriously enough to do so.  \\"Hanky Panky Nohow\\" is a good song until the lame chorus which consists of the words \\"Hanky Panky Nohow.\\"  On Vintage Violence, the lyrics are just as nonsensical, but the compositions are simply more entertaining.  That having been said, \\"Andalucia\\" is a great song and so is \\"Paris 1919\\" (especially the piano mix).<br /><br />I keep having to replay bits of the rest of the album to remember which of the other songs I liked and which I didn't.  That isn't a good sign since I have listened to it close to six or seven times now.  Comparatively, I've listened to Vintage Violence once and I still remember almost all of the songs.  Now, if you'll excuse, I'm going to go hum \\"Fairweather Friend.\\"
055302440X|5.0|Preface: I own the Bantam Books paperback editon, printing number 68 in 1988.  It includes the story where the blacks get fed up with the south and head to Mars. Some editions have this story edited out. :(<br /><br />I first read The Martin Chronicles in 1988.  I continue to come back from time to time to (to use a Bradbury phrase)dip into the wonderful writing and story telling of Ray Bradbury.  He set the standard very high when he wrote The Martian Chronicles.  The book contains one of the most important set of observations about our human issues ever written in either science fiction or science fantasy form. We see a broad picture of humankind and to some extent even racism.  It would make a fascinating study for a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation.<br /><br />Like many of Mr. Bradbury's works, The Martin Chronicles is a collection of short stories.  He turned them into a novel by writing a few transition stories to fit with ones he had already written.  He wrote these short stories in the late 1940s.  That was a time when we knew almost nothing about Mars.  He uses Mars as the backdrop for a more serious look at issues and questions including hate, war, not thinking of consequences of our actions, and pure capitalistic greed.  Mr. Bradbury visualizes an amazing future.  He sees what can be when humankind operates at our best.  He appeals to our better selves to build a better future.<br /><br />The book covers a period from 1999 through 2026.  It begins with the first manned expedition to Mars from Earth.  The American astronauts find Martians on the first journey to Mars.  The complications of the first four expeditions come from the interactions between humans and Martians.  The complications are unexpected and fascinating. The early failures of the journey would probably today have futre trips cancelled, but not in Bradbury's writing.  The complications include the basic extermination of the Martian race from one of our childhood diseases.<br /><br />In the book, much of the human colonization of Mars brings those who want to recreate Earth against those who appreciate what is special about Mars.  Therefore, exploitation versus conservation is one theme in the book.  There are magnificent stories in here against racisim, censorship of books, and war.<br /><br />Near the book's end are three stories about the a variety of meanings of loneliness.  They are wonderful.  The first looks at men and women seeking each other out when there is no other company.  The second considers the loss of a family and how to cope with that.  The third looks remorsefully at the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust.<br /><br />The last story in The Martian Chronicles, \\"The Million-Year Picnic,\\" makes me very melancholy.  From that story, you will be able to answer \\"Who are the Martians?\\"<br /><br />Read and reviewed by Jimmie A.

B000HIVO64|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out, and rightfully so because after listening to it merely once I found it arguably some of Beck's finest work yet. I'm not sure why this album would disappoint any long-time Beck fan; it's full of clever samples and awesome electronic noises right up to par with the quality of Odelay. My favorite song from Beck still remains \\"E-Pro\\" off of Guero, but there are a few nearly as glorious tracks on this album that I can't seem to get enough of (for example \\"Cellphone's Dead\\", \\"Nausea\\", \\"No Complaints\\", and especially the last song). Plenty of variety abides on The Information, with Beck rapping away in tunes such as \\"Dark Star\\" and \\"1,000 BPM\\", singing softly in tracks such as \\"Movie Theme\\", or just using his regular singing voice to emit his odd yet always catchy lyrics overtop of a creatively sampled beat. We also get to hear some of Beck's guitar-playing that sounds similar to the style of Mutations, which when given the intentionally off-key chord progressions of \\"No Complaints\\" can sound unbelievably catchy. Really what I'd most commend about this album, however, is the presence of the final track (\\"The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton). This song quite noticeably strays from the typical Beck track; it is basically the longest song he has made (unless you count the ending drivel on Stereopatheticsoulmanure), has the most outrageously cool samples of any song he has made (reversed drums, a guy talking about an exoskeleton, eerie chanting voices, and apparently come classic rock electric guitar) and basically combines three songs into one in a way that is similar to the song structure of Green Day's \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\". Now that I've heard the fifteenth song, I have a completely renewed sense of how creative Beck is; it reminded me of DJ Shadow yet with a touch of rock/pop slid into it. The creepy portion of the fifteenth song (called \\"Exoskeleton\\") is one of my favorite segments of the album. Overall, I'd say this album is asolid contender for a five-star rating and perhaps is Beck's best; it may be however that the excitement associated with this album being brand new has rushed me to make this claim a bit hastily. I do after all like Stereopatheticsoulmanure and Odelay a lot; regardless, I would consider this an absolutely awesome album that is perhaps the third best release of 2006 (Muse and Jet's 2006 albums are my favorites). I didn't find The Information to be flawed at all, even though it doesn't seem to be as well-acclaimed as Beck's other albums right now.
0751529818|5.0|I could not put this book down once I started reading it. This touching story of life and loving can teach us all a thing or two which could profoundly change our lives. I hope I have the courage at the ending of my life to live it out as Morrie Schwartz did. Mitch Albom did a wonderful work of portraying the end days of this humble man. <br /> <br />I give this book a 5 star rating due to it's touuching me in my heart.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Before listening to Light Grenades, the only CD I had heard from Incubus was Morning View, from the era where they were beginning to transition out of the DJ scratch style. I wasn't particularly impressed with Morning View nor any of the other early Incubus albums, but can at least respect them now since they paved the way for the modernized rock sound of Light Grenades and A Crow Left of the Murder. On this 2006 release, hard guitar patterns that produce a very unique sound combine with well-written lyrics to produce an overall great album with highlights such as \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off\\", \\"Anna Molly\\", and \\"Love Hurts\\". I wasn't expecting much of this CD before I first tried it out, but after two listens I would definitely consider it worth buying and among the band's best albums easily. Chances are an Incubus fan will either favor the DJ style or non-DJ style of the band more rather than equally, and I would definitely prefer the hard rock sound evident on Light Grenades and the previous album. This CD also is good for the moments where it steers away from the louder jams, maintaining soft yet still commendable rhythms in parts of \\"Earth to Bella\\" as well as \\"Love Hurts\\" (that song may be my favorite on the CD next to \\"Anna Molly\\"). I'd consider Light Grenades a worthy four-star recipient, and wouldn't necessarily say it's one of the more colossal releases of the year but it certainly is a good one.
B000JLTRKE|1.0|I can't believe this movie actually went straight to the theatre. This movie is not even worthy of typical prime-time television. Even if I lost a loved one who was portrayed in this film, I'd still be bored to tears of how it's being such an empty, long-winded, story, only focused on mainly just two people. \\"Oh, help me, help me, I'm trapped.\\" \\"We're doing what we can, we love you, we love you!\\" Oh brother! Jeez, that's some really creative writing, huh? This film was so unnecessary. We've all already imagined all the horrifying aspects of the tragedy. There's nothing new here.<br /><br />Think about it. If this event never really happened, but they made a film like this anyway. You'd have to agree that this movie is quite boring. Just a bunch of tear-shedding dialogue. This could have easily been just a low cost television show.<br /><br />Now \\"United 93\\" was definately more of a detailed story. It was much better done, and more \\"on the edge of your seat\\" entertaining. Yes, I said \\"entertaining!\\". Why do YOU go to see a movie? Because you wanna go and cry about something?  I found studying Algebra more entertaining than this long-winded yawner of a just an exchange of tearful woes and prayers.<br /><br />And what's more, why would anyone want to own this movie? To see a miserable situation played out over and over. Just like \\"The Passion of Christ\\" too. Who would actually want to watch that movie over and over just to see Jesus Christ beatened? I'm sure we all thank Jesus for suffering for our sins, but I wouldn't want to watch a movie that shows me that he's suffering for me.<br /><br />And all this \\"9-11\\" hype. C'mon, this is something of the past. We need to let it go and get on with our lives. I'm so tired of being reminded that it happened. Trying to keep this sad tragedy imbedded in our minds can not be psychologically healthy. There is no benefit in mentally sustaining an irreversable tragedy of a \\"done deal\\" event. Why give Al-Queda the pleasure of seeing us continuing to suffer from that one event? Their hearts are laughing everyday, everytime we voice our pain about that tragic day.  The more we keep showing our pain and fear of their existance, the more they'll continue enjoying the small victory of their terrorist act.<br /><br />Well anyway, there's a ball game on tonight! That's all that matters right now! Let's just focus on that and get on with our lives in a positive way.<br /><br />So, I'm sure everyone thinks that I am cold and insensitive. However, that's not true at all. Hollywood sees \\"9-11\\" as a guaranteed money maker.  Creating movies to continue to provoke everyone's fears about that day is a cold and insensitive approach to profitable commercialism.  Making money out of making movies like this is no more in \\"bad taste\\" than someone selling \\"I survived 9-11\\" T-shirts.<br /><br />Hey, now there's an idea! (just kidding).of seeing us continuing to suffer from that one event? Their hearts are laughing everyday, everytime we voice our pain about that tragic day.

0805210393|1.0|The reviews on this page refer to the newest edition and translation of The Castle, but the publication being advertised on this page is the old, error-filled Muir translation.

1594200106|5.0|I started the book a few weeks ago not sure how it would turn out. The narrative is exquisite and I savoured every word. Carlos Ruiz Zafon is able to paint vivid pictures with great articulation and imagination. The first few chapters were a little slow, with many characters that left me a bit confused and wanting. But that soon evaporated as the story became more and more intriguing. The language is fulfilling, which is more than I can say for many recent novels. The characters are different but interesting. The book undergoes a metamorphosis as the chapters follow one another and I ended up reading more than half the book in less than 24 hours... that is how gripping it was! I recomend it to all of us who like to get 'lost' in a labirynth of words and who enjoy escaping into the pages of another world!!!
0767817486|3.0|I am a Turkish citizen with a great love of cinema.  I myself am an amateur film maker.  Like many of my Turkish friends, I liked this movie as a film production.  All the good film making elements had their good ways into this cult film, such as strong performances, cinematography, music, etc.  However, what I find unforgivable for such great film makers, like Alan Parker, Oliver Stone, David Putnam is the fact that they have been a part of a great propoganda for anti-Turkish view.  I don't believe that such avid film makers of Hollywood circle would naively didn't realise this attempt.  It is so obvious that some rich lobbies funded this film as a sheer anti-Turkish propoganda, and very successfully used such names.  This, in my view, is a black stain on all.  I would have respected it highly if they were to use both side's view on the film, and remain totally unbiased to the matter.  For once, there is no Turkish player in the film, not even a decent dubbing artists, who would have eliminated those highly visible broken Turkish accents of non-Turkish actors or dubbers.   <br /> <br />The film starts portraying a very negative side of Turkey, showing some crude elements of Istanbul, as if Istanbul is a harsh and unforgiving Islamic town from mid ages.  Then the film moves into the tragic story of Bill Hayes, who got caught smuggling hashish or some kind of drug, which I don't know, because I never dealt with them.  The movie is full of terrible torturing scenes of a so-called Turkish prison, totally created from the twisted memories of Hayes in Malta.  I never have been prisoned, so I have no way of knowing how true was the Turkish prisons at that time.  I bet that they were not much different than of those in Greece, or US, or even from UK.  The actors playing the so-called Turkish figures, like lawyer, judge, attorney, spoke a very very broken Turkish language, full of spoken grammer mistakes.  Even the sets were created with a fanaticly anti-Turk view.  The scene where he curses to the entire Turkish nation, calling them and their mother all as \\"pigs\\" should be the creations of an angry anti-Turk than an acclaimed writer like Stone.  The film would probably look much nicer without such ultra-fanatic scenes. <br /> <br />The real story of the film was that Bill Hayes was helped for his escape by an officer in American consulate, who was an old lady, working at the Istanbul consulate.  I met her when I was working at the consulate during my college years in mid 80s.  She constructed (probably a well planned strategy with the helps of some political powers) a plan, by which Hayes was taken by the official boat of American consulate (known as Hiawatha) from the semi-open prison at one of the islands of Istanbul, and taken to Greece, and then to US.  Even at this account, Hayes was given a sort of privilidge at his stay in the prison to stay at one of the relatively comfortable prisons of Istanbul.   <br /> <br />As I said, I liked the film, as a movie, but, I would still criticise the film makers by being tools for such propoganda makers.  Oliver Stone himself came to Turkey recently and apologised for his mistake.  So, apart from this huge shame on the filmmakers' side, there is one scene, which is probably the closest to the most reality. That was the scene, where Hayes was going thru the security of the airport, and the acting of the policemen was just great.  Apart from these, if you keep this reality in mind while watching, the rest is a very nice film on screen, not a close reality of what you would see in Istanbul.  Oh, by the way, don't mess with any kind of drugs anyways.  You might get into some kind of trouble for fact.  And, for a bit of advice, don't mess with the Turkish police.  You might get into their bad side for once, and......
0307237699|5.0|Many of Obama's policy prescriptions are quite unremarkable. They are decidedly left-leaning, but not so left as to call him a leftist or a radical.  <br /> <br />   What sets Obama's book apart and indeed himself apart from most other politicians is his ability to imbue civility and deliberation in his decision making procedure. His book is not an ideological rant, even though it is left-leaning, it is much more thoughtful and inquisitive. In many ways Obama's prescriptions are pragmatic and implementarian. He wants to solve social ills as most liberals do, but unlike many liberals he sees tangible results as a necessary prerequisite for the continuation of certain progressive policies. His insistence on deliberation and civility in discourse have been inappropriately been called disingenuous by his detractors.  The one common strand that seems to link those who see Obama as insincere is there common adherence to some ideology, be it conservative or liberal. Surprisingly, or actually unsurprisingly, Obama's equanimity and sudden rise to fame has quietly unnerved liberal ideologues just as it much as it has conservative ideologues. This is because despite Obama's liberal tilt, he is not nearly as dangerous to conservatives as he is to ideologues. His insistence on thinking things through and acknowledging the complexities of modern life serve to strip the armor from ideologues of every color and creed. He message is a call to arms, but one that does not attack a group per se, rather it attacks dogmatic and ideological stagnation that plagues most anyone who becomes too complacent in their ways. I for one have found this message incredibly enlightening and uplifting.
B00005JNS0|3.0|The movie was beautifully done.  BUT I have come to look forward to the commentary track and behind the scenes creative madness.   <br /> <br />In this version, you just get the movie and 2 shorts.   <br /> <br />Hopefully Pixar will release a 2 disk version in the near future -- wait for it for the full Pixar magic.
0060853964|4.0|I know that people can screw up just about anything, but The End of The World? Come on, some things really should be done properly if they're done at all.<br /><br />But, with Pratchett and Gaiman telling the story, it just can't go as planned, not even if it's a divine plan. All the pieces are there: angels and demons (not that there's a lot of difference between them), the Four Horsemen, the hellspawn who's destined to start Armageddon, and his loyal, tail-wagging hellhound. There's also Agnes Nutter, the long-dead seer who prophesied it all, right down to who her many-greats granddaughter would have as overnight company on the eve of destruction.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of both Gaiman and Pratchett. They've both turned out big bodies of outstanding work. I guess that's why I came away just a little disappointed by this. It has neither the other-world creepiness of Gaiman's best, nor the barely-contained madness of Pratchett's, so it really doesn't measure up to the standards set by either. Still, it's a good enough read. If you like work by these authors, you'll probably enjoy this one too.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000IMV4IW|3.0|3.5 to be honest<br /><br />OK, My favourite oasis album is \\"Be here now\\" so this is quite a subjective review...<br /><br />There was a lot of people that complained about Be here now being bloated and the lads being arrogant... all that bigger than the beatles stuff... but let's face it, that's part of what made them so cool, was their arrogance and how it translated into music.<br /><br />Be here now has undeniable hits, amongst Oasis best music, song that had to be on a greatest hits compilation, even if the records was liked by the media or not.<br /><br />D'You know what I mean (My favourite amongst Oasis complete catalog) and Don't go away had... they just had to be there.<br /><br />It's like there was so much trash talk within the media and some of the fans regarding the album that Noel actually ended up buying that nonsense.<br /><br />That's that... let's say OK they were noisy songs from a noisy bloated album... (Though it' is just an assumption, I think they are cream of the crop) but what's the deal with leaving out Stop Crying your heart out or little by little? And let's talk about THE HINDU TIMES !!! I mean that song is pure OASIS !!! Leaving Hindu and D'you out of the album should be considered and offense to the fans.<br /><br />Greatest hits is an album of a band's greatest hits, where the band likes them or not (Some of their actual greatest hits)<br /><br />Besides that, the songs featured are great, some of them might actually have been replaced by the ones left out... great never the less...<br /><br />The problem as another reviewer accurately stated is with what is not in the album...<br /><br />C'mon lads you left behind your best album and some of your best songs !!!
B000002QWD|5.0|Bing Crosby's mellifluous baritone is wonderful in this collection.  Anyone who has ever heard the man sing will know this album is terrific.  So I'm not going to review the music itself.  Instead, I want to evaluate the technical quality of the recording. <br /> <br />This CD was produced in 1998 by MCA Records, Inc.  A disclaimer in fine print states, \\"This compact disc contains programs transferred from analog tape and therefore may contain some tape hiss and other anomalies that exist with analog recordings.\\"  Come on, guys.  The recording doesn't reveal tape hiss; the listener can clearly hear the sounds of scratches from a well used LP.  Not to mention, the treble is overmodulated.  My opinion is MCA did not go back to \\"the tapes\\" to make this disc.  Instead, they found a used LP and simply copied it, and badly at that.  Couldn't they have found a source with decent fidelity?  Or at least, made an attempt to clean up the one they had?  I own a practically pristine copy of the original LP that's head and shoulders above this inexpensive knock off. <br /> <br />Too bad MCA had to take the cheap way to produce this CD.  I, for one, would have been willing to pay more for a better produced disc.
B00006GEXQ|4.0|\\"About a Boy\\" isn't your typical 'Hugh Grant Romantic Comedy,' and it's completely unexpected for a product from the directors of \\"American Pie.\\" And it's better for it. As much as I love \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" and \\"Notting Hill,\\" this is the movie that rates a place in my DVD collection. Every time I watch it, it never fails to charm me, make me smile, and move me a little. How can you not love a movie that includes themes like suicide, depression and adolescent and modern-day allienation and weaves them into a comedy?  <br /> <br />It's based on a Nick Hornby novel so, of course, it nails relationships from a male point of view. As screwed up as Hornby's protaganists are, I always feel better about men after I watch them. In this case, the \\"boys\\" in question are Will, a 38-year-old self-absorbed hipster, and Marcus, a dorky teenage kid with a troubled home and school life. The two of them form a friendship which makes both of them better, as you'd expect, but none of it comes off smaltzy or predictable. This is due to the performances by Grant and his young co-star, Nicholas Hoult, who hit all the right notes and make their strange friendship believable. Toni Collette is also grand as Marcus' struggle hippy single mother. There is a romance between Will and the Rachel character, but it doesn't dominate the movie and even that subplot stays grounded in reality. <br /> <br />The ending school concert often gets bagged on in reviews, and it is the part of the movie that feels the most contrived, but it still makes me smile. \\"About a Boy\\" is one of those lightly dramatic comedies where you do a lot of smiling.  <br /> <br />The DVD has some nifty features as well. The commentary by the Weitz brothers is entertaining, and it contains some nice touches like the \\"English to English\\" dictionary and a couple featurettes on the music of Badly Drawn Boy. The music, incidentally, is tight. One of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. All in all, I like this movie. I like it a lot.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard in a movie theater. I had tears in my eyes and pains in my stomach! This film has a brilliant script, amazing cast, and flawless humor. I can't wait to share it with my family at Christmas.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I can't believe the neg. reviews on this CD.  They must be guys who are jealous of his good looks and #1 video of \\"The Kill\\".  I saw the video of \\"The Kill\\" on youtube and I fell immediately in love with it.  I play it 3 times a week, he is very easy on the eyes and full of emotion when he sings.  I buy the emotion in the video, he is better than most musicians in videos.  Then they started airing \\"from yesterday\\" on the radio and I also liked that one too.  I recommend this CD to anybody who wants a fresh suave femme modern rock with a hard edge.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Excellent movie, one of Nicholas Cage's best. Excellent preformance by everyone involved. Excellent story. Excellent effects. Kick a** movie, and the Extended/Directors Cut changed too much. The original is way better.
B000J103OI|5.0|The first thing I thought about when I saw this movie is the depths that these gals will put up with when dealing with a boss like that.  Few could, especially with an Ivy League degree.  They actually have suggested this character was based on one of the major fashion magazine's Senior Editor and she really behaves like that.  Size 6 is fat?  If they were going to put new laws into the law books it should be this kind of body image the magazines promote should be illegal and unethical.  They are the reason for the eating disorders.  Thank goodness this was a novel because I was agast at this movie several times to the point where it did make me laugh because it was so absurd.  I would like to see a movie with the opposite idea that the magazine caters to the majority of women, the Rosanne's and the hard working housewives who would never spend that kind of money on clothing or accessories rather than the materialistic single girls that must have those brand names to make them feel superior.  But all in all, who can turn there TV off and quit looking at these magazines?  It fills in our normal boring lives.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|First and foremost, \\"Love\\" is the soundtrack to the current Las Vegas Cirque du Soleil spectacle and all the songs included here were chosen because they would provide an appropriate backdrop for acrobatics and dancing. Considering that, I am amazed that it's as good as it is. Musically, a decision was made that all the songs should flow into one another as if it were a stream-of-consciousness medley and from time to time producer Giles Martin jazzes things up by creating mini-mashups. For the most part, however, we're given a series of strong remixes of late-period Beatles music. All the remixes - even the weakest ones - take full advantage of stereo effects, and are a lot of fun to listen to with headphones. (Supposedly, none of the Beatles' parts were rerecorded but the bass guitar is so powerful and contemporary-sounding, I swear McCartney put in some recent studio time).    So, songs like \\"I am the Walrus\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" are given dazzling new remixes, there's a great \\"Mr Kite/I Want You/Helter Skelter\\" montage, and a nearly perfect mashup based on \\"Drive My Car.\\" I can honestly say \\"Something\\" has never sounded better, and I really enjoyed the many juxtapositions this CD has to offer. As for negatives, there are also plenty. Unless you adore mid-60s pseudo-raga, there's way too much George Harrison-as-Guru here. Some of the songs (\\"Back in the USSR,\\" \\"Hey Jude\\") are also presented in an abbreviated format, which is maddening because there's no reason to go to the trouble of remixing these songs and then giving us incomplete versions. I was also annoyed that virtually nothing the Beatles recorded before 1965 is here, with far too heavy an emphasis on the psychedelic stuff.    \\"Love\\" will likely infuriate Beatles purists who believe that George Martin's mixes are sacrosanct, and younger hipsters will gripe that the mashup concept wasn't taken far enough. As for me, I enjoyed the CD a lot and view it for what it really is - an accessory to the Beatles' catalog. \\"Anthology\\" didn't replace the existing Beatles CDs. Neither did \\"Let it be naked\\" or the \\"Capitol Boxed Sets.\\" These are CDs for people who would like to add a bit of variety to their collections and, honestly, there's nothing wrong with that. I can't claim that this is a classic CD that's going to stand the test of time, but it's much better than I thought it was going to be. Give it a try if you are curious, or just stay away if you aren't.
0553278223|5.0|The conquest of Mars was a popular theme in the science fiction of the golden age, and novels on the topic usually featured a square-jawed, all-American hero killing Little Green Men who had suspiciously Red tendencies. Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles revisits this subject, but presents a far more thoughtful, complex analysis of the issues involved. In this loosely connected series of short stories, he explores issues of conquest and colonisation. He looks at how the discovery of a \\"new\\" land inevitably means the destruction of existing cultures and artifacts, and at how colonists are rarely pioneers or visionaries looking for a new way of life but merely individuals wanting to reproduce the American Dream (or their culture's equivalent of it) in a new place. He also tackles the issues of censorship and governmental repression that he will later go on to explore in his compelling and searing Fahrenheit 451. Consequently, Mars may be read as a metaphor for the frontier, for the New World, for any point of contact between cultures.  <br /> <br />Reading the Martian Chronicles at the time when most of it is set, parts of it may appear archaic. Bradbury did not predict the Civil Rights' movement of the 1960s, the second wave feminism that changed the role of women, or the profound advances of technology that have taken place in the last fifty years. He also knew little about the Martian landscape that various probes have revealed to us, although I would argue that his Mars is not meant to be a real place but a fantastic vision of the ultimate new frontier.  <br /> <br />Even so, he can hardly be blamed for the science of the time's ignorance; more important is the fact the essential issues that the novel explores are as relevant and as interesting as they were in the 1940s. The Martian Chronicles is a beautiful, sad and elegaic piece of work that will be appreciated by anyone who enjoys thinking deeply about political and social issues.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|I'll start by saying I was terribly disappointed, though honestly I knew it was coming to this after 'Couldn't Have Said It Better'.  His previous album had not been on par with those that came before it, but to take the 'Bat Out Of Hell' title and use it with such material, it's almost offensive.  The 'Bat Out Of Hell' concept to me meant quality, and the musical genius of Jim Steinman.  Sadly to say, Desmond Child is no Jim Steinman, and this album lacked the magic the first two had managed to build.  Even the songs on here by Steinman were not as grand as I was hoping, it seemed Meat Loaf didn't even try.  I have heard most the songs Steinman contributed for this album elsewhere, and they were far better.  I would have given this a lower rating, but it is still Meat Loaf, and does contain some Steinman gems.  My favorite song from this album was 'In The Land Of The Pig, The Butcher Is King', and you can not help but love Steinman's lyrical genius on 'Seize The Night'.  Such songs as 'The Monster Is Loose' were complete monstracities, taking Meat from his theatrical rock opera roots, to something I could have seen Edguy or the like performing, it just wasn't what I expected from Meat Loaf.  In conclusion, I did buy this album to complete the trilogy and my Meat Loaf collection, but as a stand alone album I personally don't feel it's worth the money.  With the first two 'Bat Out Of Hell' albums he created a legacy, but even as he once said, two out of three ain't bad.
0385486804|5.0|Krakauer dissects the compelling story of Chris McCandless, who lost his life during his self-proclaimed \\"great Alaskan Odyssey.\\" This is not the story of a boy who lost his life in the wilderness, but rather of Chris McCandless, who in the Wilderness found exactly what he'd been looking for his entire life. <br /> <br />The story, however, is not limited to the life of McCandless. Krakauer breaks into memoir at several points, identifying with McCandless on personal and visceral levels. While his ability to empathize and connect with McCandless helps him write a chilling narrative, it can be reasonably argued that it also sidetracks him. One of the chapters, for example, is exclusively focussed on a personal journey that Krakauer took; McCandless' name is not even mentioned. The final chapter focuses more on Krakauer's personal connection with and interest in McCandless than it does on Chris himself. This is not a fault in the book itself, but an unsuspecting reader may find it to be narcissistic or indulgent.  <br /> <br />Krakauer's experiences phenomenally qualify him to tell this story, but the reader should be prepared to find as much psychoanalysis and empathetic insight as he finds factual information and assertions.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|First of all, the battle scene is one of the best supernatural battle scenes from a movie I've seen.  The plasma and the attacks look very real.  I thought that this was much better than The Craft, which is quite silly and cheesy.  The cast is handsome and that always makes for a nice to watch movie.  The mood created throughout is fantastic with the dark scenes, brooding buildings, quaint yet creepy town.  Yeah, there's rain at night and not during the day, but who gives a freak?  That's a silly thing to complain about.  Movies are redundant, deal with it.  Everyone expects something completely different in every single movie, but that's not the reality of the matter, so enjoy a movie for what it is, and this one is SUPERB.  I thought the acting was believable and the special effects were really great and look completely realistic, which is a good thing except for the scene with the spiders. :)  The soundtrack is on point, due to the fact that they got it perfectly.  I recommend this movie to everyone.

B00003CX5P|1.0|This movie is so painfully bad, it's astonishing. George Lucas has clearly lost it. It seems that he rufused any insight from anyone else and took on this project by his ego-maniacal self. When he collaborated with screenwriter greats like Lawrence Kasden in the past films, the films turned out great mostly because of the great character development and the on-screen chemistry between the characters. Unfortunatly, he thought he could do it himself on this one. And what was the turnout: Over two hours of the most audience insulting #$%* ever invented. The characters had absolutely no life and the dialogue was painful to hear.  <br /> <br />The CGI was horrendous. What is the deal with modern filmakers sacrificing substance for crap like CGI. Yes, it is essential at times, but it doesn't need to dominate an entire movie like GL did with this piece of fluff.  <br /> <br />There was no character development at all. You didn't care at all for any of the characters and most of the \\"main\\" characters were really one dimensional.  <br /> <br />The storyline was uninteresting and the whole midichlorians crap ruins everything the old Star Wars movies stood for. So George, you are great because you were born like that? No one has the choice to make themselves truly heroic? It all depends on something you were born with? That's just absurd. You completely betrayed your fans with this awful movie.  <br /> <br />If this movie was made 20 years before it came out, it probably would have been a lot better because I believe George Lucas would have had a lot more help. I think he just got so full of himself he thought he was somekind of god. And he was so god-like in his powers that he came up with Jar-Jar binks, the most annoying, despicable, absolutely awful character imagined by the mind of man.  <br /> <br />George, do me a favor and don't ever make any more movies. The world will be a much better place w/ out them
B00002MHRW|5.0|Traffic started off as an outside project for Spencer Davis Group member Steve Winwood in April 1967 and featured friends Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood. Jim brought along his friend Dave Mason and the group recorded a couple of singles as well as a couple of songs for the movie Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush. The band's first album, Mr Fantasy was released in England in December 1967 in both Stereo and Mono. This is the stereo version. The band's sound at this time was very psychedelic and very much in the spirit of Revolver and Sargent Pepper's. Dave Mason would leave the group by the time the album was released only to return during the sessions for the band's second album. As was common place at the time, the original English version of the album was changed and renamed Heaven Is In Your Mind, by the time it reached America with a slightly different track list with the band's early singles added and a couple of album tracks removed. the order of the songs was also shuffled. The band wasn't happy about it. The album opens with a great song called Heaven Is In Your Mind and features cool stereo panning between speakers. Berkshire Poppies is great fun and is followed by Dave Mason's Houses for Everyone. The first half of the album ends with a great sequence of No Face, No Name, No Number and Dear Mr. Fantasy. The second half of the album opens with the Jim Capaldi sung Dealer and is followed by Dave's Utterly Simple. Steve's Coloured Rain is another standout and is followed by Hope I Never Find Me There. The original album ends with a great jazzy instrumental called Giving To You. The bonus tracks on this release is the original American Mono mix which was different from both the English Stereo and Mono mixes

Blige covering Steve Wonder's \\"As, which was not included in the 1999 release due to marketing/label/\\"moral values\\" issues, it also includes two new songs, one of which \\"An Easy Affair\\" that I think rocks, but it misses key songs.<br /><br />On the other hand \\"Twentyfive\\" surprisingly overlooks key songs in George's catalogue (you CAN'T have a best of that does not include \\"I Want Your Sex\\" or \\"Hard Day\\" just to name a couple).

I give it a 4 when there is enough material in Michael's catalogue to produce a 5+ release.<br /><br />One last non-rating related personal comment: Here's hoping that George gets back to recording songs that remind you of why he became such a superstar in the first place. He seems to think that growing up means that his music has to somehow be more mature, but mature need not be the adult contemporary road and I wish that he could pull or attempt to pull what Madonna did with \\"Confessions on the Dancefloor\\" to remind new artists that some acts that came of age in the 1980s had talent to spare and were not simply by the number acts from Disney.

B000JJRIN4|3.0|Mr. Rossdale should speak to his wife. I imagine that Gavin must upchuck at the sound of his wife's music as Bush was nothing like what's on \\"The Sweet Escape\\". I don't know why Gwen doesn't just work with her husband. That would make an interesting musical collaboration which might just restore all the old fans she's lost with her last two solo albums. She appears to have hopped on the creamy-sweet hip hop bandwagon. I mean, am I tired of seeing The Neptunes spring up on almost everything these days? Pharrell only recycles what little talent he has--see \\"Yummy\\", which is a dead ringer for The Neptunes produced, Kelis hit \\"Milkshake\\". Why all the producers on \\"LAMB\\" and now \\"The Sweet Escape\\"?<br /><br />The best songs on \\"The Sweet Escape\\" are, without a doubt, \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"4 In The Morning\\". \\"Wind It Up\\" is nice, but it's a regurgitation of \\"Hollaback Girl\\". Other potential hits are the Akon (how trendy) produced title track, the (ultra) trendy \\"Now That You Got It\\", replete with background siren, because you know you can't have a hip hop song without that these days, and \\"Wonderful Life\\". Some songs almost made the mark like \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\", \\"Yummy\\" and \\"Fluorescent\\". By far, the worst track is \\"Breakin' Up\\". If anyone says that's a great song, they're deaf.<br /><br />\\"Orange County Girl\\" and \\"U Started It\\" are just okay. I'll tell you what,  if Gwen wants to pick producers why not try Ric Ocasek (of The Cars), Billy Corgan (of Smashing Pumpkins), Brian Eno (of Roxy Music), Daniel Lanois (U2, Robbie Robertson), Flood (U2, Erasure), Stephen Lipson (Annie Lennox), or, as I said before, her husband, Gavin Rossdale (of Bush).<br /><br />Also, enough with the navel-gazing lyrics. Gwen is a 37 year old woman, and now a mother. It's time to grow up and write about something meaningful. The party's over, time to get serious.<br /><br />One more thing, now that Gwen has hit the stratosphere of fame as a solo artist, how in the world will she get back together with No Doubt and make any new material work? Or will this be a Phil Collins/Genesis thing where you end up being unable to distinguish whether it's Gwen or whether it's No Doubt?<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Sweet Escape\\" is slightly better and more cohesive than \\"LAMB\\", but they're both about equal.k together with No Doubt and make any new material work?

B00004W510|5.0|I enjoyed the review that likened this ridiculously brilliant album to prog rock. I'd be more likely to call it roots and Americana rendered as chamber music, but the idea is the same. <br /> <br />The vocal harmonies are at once barnyard and equisite. The group interplay is spacious and telepathic. And for about 3 or 4 years JR Roberstson hit a high that few American songwriters can rival. <br /> <br />My favorites? When You Awake, Whispering Pines, Unfaithful Servant, Jawbone, and King Harvest (Has Surely Come), for starters, and I'm aware that I've overlooked the two legendardy classic rock staples that the album produced. <br /> <br />After listening to this album, it's a little hard to swallow the loss of Richard Manual, isn't it? My goodness, what a singer.

0060723513|2.0|About ten years ago I read and was profoundly moved by this book.  I didn't know then that it was all a big hoax and that Marlo Morgan never went walkabout with Aborigines.  I usually hate stories that lie to me, but this book is different.  Having gotten over my feeling of being snookered, I find its messages too deep to ignore.  Even if Marlo Morgan never left American soil, she still tells a vitally important and universal story:  the coded tale of her own unconscious psychology.<br /><br />For reasons of her own immaturity she couldn't find a more straightforward way to share her tale, so she created the platform of a fictionalized drama to express the different unintegrated parts of herself - which is what all great fiction writers do (and what everyone does when they dream).  Marlo Morgan just went the extra step, one generally considered \\"unethical,\\" and pretended her fiction was true.  Perhaps she even believed it.  But she's not the first:  how do we think the Bible and the world's other creation stories got written down?  The line between fiction and nonfiction is always cloudy, especially with stories with the deepest messages.<br /><br />Here, I feel, is Marlo Morgan's message, stripped of its cheesy, New Age veneer and boiled down to its essence:  our world is radically and profoundly in trouble, we're destroying our ecosystems at an amazingly fast past, our souls and perhaps our species are soon to be going down the tubes alongside the creatures whose demises we are effecting, and our priorities in life are all out of whack.  We don't listen to our deeper emotional messages, we ignore the obvious in our quest to assuage our infantile desires, and we bury our souls in addictions of a thousand different varieties.  We create terrible and unnecessary complexities which will invariably haunt future generations, we shut our eyes to the suffering of others - especially that which we ourselves cause - and we go on and on mindlessly procreating in our insatiable thirst for sex and romance and comfort.<br /><br />The problem is, Morgan herself cannot put the strength of her character behind her message because it's too honest and painful for her to handle - it rubs too much against the grain of her external personality.  After all, she's a mother, a societally-accepted doctor, an ex-beauty queen, and most importantly an idealizer of her own limited parents, to whom she dedicates her book.  And because she idealizes them she could never own her Real, True Self, and instead had to project it onto an idealized \\"other\\" - whom she titles, not coincidentally, the \\"Real People.\\"<br /><br />Her detractors note that in reality she knew very little about Australian Aborigines and mostly just constructed her \\"Real People\\" from her wistful knowledge of Native Americans tribes and her own New Age-oriented imagination.  I bet they're right.  But as for her detractors (not all of whom are so accurate themselves, as they often misquote and misrepresent her!), one wonders how much of their hatred of her is due, as they claim, to her utter misportrayal of Aborigines, and how much, as I instinctively suspect is more likely the case, is due to their unconscious terror of her deeper message.  The weak always hate the strong.  They love nothing more than putting the strong to death, and unless they are on a truly growing path will never admit their true motives...

B000022TSY|5.0|Despite having aged in the last 30+ years, \\"Easy Rider\\" remains one of the most important and influential films ever made. Written by Dennis Hopper & Peter Fonda (with Terry Southern) and directed by Hopper; Easy Rider is a film that introduced the world to a rising young star named Jack Nicholson, a film that is on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List (#88), and is a brilliant look at the drug/hippie culture of the 60's. Fonda and Hopper play Wyatt & Billy, two men who experience freedom by riding their motorcycles around. The movie has such a lack of plot; I'm not even entirely sure how to sum it up. Even more amazing is how detailed and elaborate this film actually is. Carrying cocaine in one of the gas tanks, they ride around while encountering various eccentric characters. They also encounter ignorance, bigotry, and, eventually, George Hanson (Nicholson), a drunken lawyer who joins the boys on their ride. Nicholson got an Oscar nomination for his role and receives star billing, but isn't actually in the movie very long. He definitely steals the show, though. The movie, for me, evoked memories of a film called \\"Midnight Cowboy.\\" It too had star-making performances (by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight), took a look at the hippie/Andy Warhol-drug culture, and has a similar grainy look and feel to it. While I think Midnight Cowboy is a better film, Easy Rider is a more important one. Almost anyone who watches it will agree that time hasn't been very kind to the movie, yet people still watch this movie to this day. It's #88 on The American Film Institute's List, but if that list was in order of watched most frequently it would place in the top 10 (probably below or next to Pulp Fiction, Casablanca, The Godfather, A Clockwork Orange, etc.). One of the best (and most haunting) moments comes in the end. That inevitable moment would be changed in today's Hollywood in favor for a happy ending. This is the only ending that could've worked for a movie about guys like these. This is an unforgettable motion picture experience. <br /> <br />GRADE: A-

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I considered myself reasonably well educated on the topic of global warming and still found the presentation interesting and moving.   <br /> <br />The movie revolves around the content of a slide show Gore gives all over the world, over 1,000 times according to the movie.  Gore does a good job of presenting the information. He tells the story from different perspectives (water temperature, air temperature, CO2 levels, visuals from space) and is especially effective at putting the story in the context of earth's history. <br /> <br />So many of the negative reviews are trying to either discredit Al Gore or the science he presents.  I wonder if half of them have even seen the movie, because their arguments mirror the exact frustrations expressed in the movie about how motivated organizations have effectively confused the public with misinformation.  If you don't believe the movie, that's fine, but at least watch the movie and decide for yourself. <br /> <br />My wife and I were both quite touched by the movie.  I didn't think it was worthing adding a 251st review to the list of amazon reviews, but her response was, \\"Just do it.

B00003CX8U|3.0|At the end of the seventies, Bob Fosse, director of \\"Cabaret,\\" created the most striking--and certainly the most controversial--original musical film to appear in many years... Audacious or intimidating, dazzling or simply bewildering, depending on one's point of view, \\"All That Jazz\\" was Fosse's extravagant homage to the musical stage he loved--a love tempered by wit and irony--and an autobiographical account of one man's hectic travail in the theater, ending with the ultimate experience of his death... His Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider), egotistical, selfish, and womanizing, but also guilt-ridden and striving for a perfection he can never achieve, perceives his entire life in terms of show business... This obsessive view is his gift, his burden, and his tragic flaw...<br /><br />\\"All That Jazz\\" is the most cinematic musical in a very long time... In a style clearly influenced by Italian director Federico Fellini, Fosse uses the camera with brave insurance, moving from naturalistic scenes of frenzied theatrical activity to flights of fantasy, without signaling the audience when the realism ends and the fantasy begins...<br /><br />Viewed entirely through Joe Gideon's brilliant, disorderly mind, the world is composed of the important people in his life--his ex-wife, his present girlfriend, his young daughter, and all the slightly mad, flamboyant show people he works with, as well as figures from his past and future, most especially the ravishing young woman who represents the Angel of Death...<br /><br />\\"All That Jazz\\" has some painful moments, and is not easy to follow; it demands the attention that many viewers, irritated by Fosse's self-indulgence, were unwilling to give...<br /><br />Splendidly photographed, \\"All That Jazz\\" follows Gideon through the exhausting, driving day-to-day routine...

B00005JOLI|3.0|A fantasy film can be described in many ways, but they're expected to include a number of formulaic elements: the unlikely hero; the damsel in distress; the wise elder; goblins, elves, and wizards; a trek across different lands; an evil ruler. \\"Eragon\\" is a story that makes use of them all, and I suppose some of you may find this appealing due to the popularity of the fantasy genre. But others may see such tried and true inclusions as problematic. I'm one of those others. \\"Eragon\\" is an unimpressive, unoriginal effort, filled with ideas that have been utilized far too many times. I was not excited by anything this film had to offer, nor did I find anything particularly special about the characters. This is about as predictable as it gets when it comes to a fantasy film.    Diehard fans of the original Christopher Paolini novel will most likely hate this film adaptation; it's pretty unfaithful to the source material (something that wasn't all that good to begin with). Those who have not read the novel may be a bit more flexible, though they still may find that something is lacking from the narrative quality, namely an original idea. It begins when Princess Arya (Sienna Guillory) uses her magical powers to transport a shiny blue stone away from the clutches of the ruthless Durza (Robert Carlyle). It then lands in the middle of a forest and is found by young Eragon (Ed Speleers), a local farm boy with no previous acts of courage or heroism to his name. He immediately decides to take the stone home with him. Already, one of the many cliche elements enters the story: an object of power and mystery falls into the hands of the story's would-be hero. Can we say J.R.R. Tolkien?    After returning home, Eragon discovers that what he possesses isn't a stone: it's an egg. It hatches, revealing a baby dragon that's surprisingly cute. Immediately, the two take on a pet/owner relationship, with the dragon responding affectionately to his petting. It quickly develops into a full-grown, majestic behemoth, with a striking blue tone to its scales. As it grows, Eragon discovers that it can hear his thoughts. Likewise, he can hear those of the dragon, and that's when he learns its identity: her name is Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz). He also learns that he's now destined to become a Dragon Rider, a medieval form of protection for the people. How they did this and why, I'm not entirely sure; their development as legendary figures is weak at best. What is explained is that, long ago, dragons and Dragon Riders were mercilessly slaughtered and are now considered extinct. Funny; I'm suddenly reminded of the Jedi Knights.    Their demise was at the hands of King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), a malevolent dictator who started out as a Dragon Rider before wanting to achieve complete control. He kept with him one remaining dragon's egg, the same one that was stolen by Arya and sent to Eragon. Now Galbatorix has to find this boy and kill him before he has the chance to become a Dragon Rider. We already have another cliche element: an evil figure has to hunt down and destroy a boy with a destiny. Eat your hearts out, J.K. Rowling and George Lucas.    Helping Eragon on his journey is Brom (Jeremy Irons), a disgraced man with a troubled past. He understands how important Eragon is, and he does everything he can to prepare him for his new role in life. For one thing, he teaches the boy how to fight. He also informs him that a dragon's magic can turn a Dragon Rider into a wizard, giving him magical abilities he normally wouldn't have. Eragon quickly discovers that he's gained certain magical abilities, including being able to see what Saphira sees and shooting blue flames. He does all this by speaking words of an ancient Elvin language that supposedly takes a long time to learn. Miraculously, Eragon learns it after just a couple of scenes.    This is but one example of how overly condensed this film felt. It was as if too many details were removed in order to make it simpler and easily understood by a mass audience. Consider the character of Murtagh (Garrett Hedlund); he meets Eragon under mysterious circumstances, then they both travel to a village hidden behind a waterfall (supposedly belonging to a group that opposes Galbatorix's rule). The leader of this group, Ajihad (Djimon Hounsou), immediately throws Murtagh in jail because of bad family ties. After that quick exchange, nothing more is learned. Here's a subplot that was virtually neglected, pretty much to the point of making Murtagh an unnecessary character. What exactly did his father do to make Ajihad's people hate him?    The truth is that all of the characters felt underdeveloped: Eragon's back story is barely mentioned; his cousin, Roran (Chris Egan) leaves the film before he can say anything insightful; Brom's role is superceded by Eragon's mission; and Arya is probably the biggest mystery of all, with no clear purpose other than being Durza's captive. I was especially disappointed with Galbatorix; while Malkovich's performance was good (if incredibly short), it seemed as if it belonged in a different film, specifically one that's not of the fantasy genre. I never once believed that he fit into this imaginative world, which is a shame considering his range as an actor. Still, his character is fierce and overbearing, enough so to instill fear in Durza.    I suppose I have to give \\"Eragon\\" credit for its decent special effects and stunning cinematography; the film was certainly wonderful to look at, especially during some breathtaking flight scenes with Eragon and Saphira. Fans of the fantasy genre will definitely get their money's worth: if you want a classic Good vs. Evil fable with caricatures, that's exactly what you're going to get. I guess I'm at a point where I want to see something new, something that doesn't begin with a young boy being chosen and end with a frenetic battle sequence. The ads for this film say that it's the first chapter in the Inheritance Trilogy, meaning that the sequel--\\"Eldest\\"--is already on the way. I can't say that I'm looking forward to it. For that matter, I'm not looking forward to the third film, either; if both are anything like the first, then we're in for one of the most uninspired trilogies in existence.

The intro's to every song are most annoying aswell; Blackmore going on and on and on to the point of yelling at the TV screen for him to pack off and start the song.

B000H2NA30|5.0|This was a great book. For non-fiction it read a lot like a novel and was very interesting. The author is honest in her story and displays her emotions very well. This book shows an in-depth and vivid look at how U-boats survived during the Holocaust and World War Two.
0805080120|5.0|I so much enjoyed reading this book. I also liked the author's balanced view on the human language especially regaring 'innateness' vs. 'cultural evolution'. I would suggest reading this book before reading Steven Pinker's 'The language instinct'.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Lots of Hollywood efforts toward dramatizing WW2 look too glossy, make the death too sanitized or far flung gore.  Human relations are usually lost, and love stories thrown in to grab the girls.  It becomes about the grit, the determination, and the supermen on the line.  But, in this mini-series you get actual relations of people in the military ranks, to leadership, to each other, and shows them dealing with the chaos of war in a very human approach and without piles of blood and intestines strewn through the shots to hammer home the idea that someone died.  <br /> <br />Made by the 'Private Ryan' heads, I found this film much better.  'Private Ryan' was rather boring.  It did what it had to do - punctuate the hell of D-Day, and then get you into the closer fighting in towns, and the lack of orientation that must happen in heated battles.  But 'Ryan' seemed like a comic book compared to this adaptation of a book by a US soldier in WWII.  'Band Of Brothers' takes you through the entire experience of the war, and makes it work by making a stew of solid entertainment crafted from great acting, great writing and script editing, great directing (most times), great lighting, great effects, great characters, great settings, and wonderful detail.  Is it precisely historic?  Who can really say?  The Euros and war-sissies always get strung out on anything that isn't their view of events from a distant seat.  From what I know of WW2 and how people are under pressure in situations of danger, this sure seems absolutely plausible.  But, what does it matter?  The purpose of this is to create an escapism drama wrapped around real people and events.  And it succeeds 110%. <br /> <br />The weakest facet of most all dramatic simplifications of complex histories is that they can easily lose many people that are not intimately aware of the geography, time line, or greater events surrounding the subject portrayed.  'Band of Brothers' would have really been aided by the old standard ofa map with arrows animating along to show how the troops were progressing, or where they were at every part of the story (usually beginning of episodes).  It really was getting confusing during the battle of the bulge when the 101st was surrounded, but you never get the idea they were truly surrounded or cut off, and have no idea where this all is taking place; fox holes, town, blue lighting, yellow lighting, two worlds apart, people say things, we can't tell what is going on, somehow it is connected. <br /> <br />Despite the nay saying, this really does show a lot of the earthy and practical attitudes of Americans under fire.  Some falter, some crack, some die, some harden themselves, some are afraid, some fool hardy, and true to the history they make it work by applying pressure and standing ground.  You can tell how everyone is changed by the war, and how most will go back home and have trouble sleeping for decades to come after all they were through.  Contrary to the soldier who commented a while back, I remember seeing a documentary that related how Eisenhower came into Berlin, or some part of Germany at the end of the war, saw the unshaven, sloppy, dirty, US soldiers contrasted against the clean, proper lines and energy of the Germans, and said something like, 'We have to do something.  Our soldiers look like sacks of garbage.'  And thus, Ike got the army uniform trimmed.  'Band' shows the men slowly becoming dirtier, more unkempt, and scattered through the heavy battles up to the end of the war when they cleaned up very well after the pressure was off.  I don't envy the men of WW2, but I sure do thank them for a job well done.  And I thank Hanks/Spielberg for dramatizing it so effectively.
B000A88EV4|5.0|Mike Leigh's organic masterpiece, Naked, is a raw, unflinching character study of a man on the run from himself and everyone around him.  The setting of his journey takes place in the midst of poverty and loss of social identity during the thick of the Thatcherism era.  With Naked, he integrates the environment into his narratives much more deliberately than most others.  We get a sense that Mr. Leigh has a lot to say.  He delivers biting commentary on society, and how it affects the relationships of its characters.  All of the characters could even be viewed as a fragmented alter ego of the director, acting as translators for all his pent up anger and honest views of society under Thatcher.  In a sequence of literary symbolism, in which the main character, Johnny, wanders through the grim, decaying streets of London, happens upon Archie, \\"the Scotsman with a tick,\\" who is pacing around violently, repeatedly shouting (for his girlfriend) \\"Maggie!\\" But, nobody answers.  That minor narrative device, speaks volumes about how Margaret Thatcher (i.e. Maggie) did not respond to her people due to the lack of involvement on the wellbeing of the middle and lower-class society.       The environment, in which he creates, becomes a crucial factor in transcending his message, and by doing this he creates more depth and universal meaning in his stories.  A process that defines this realism is his approach to creating the dramatic narrative through lengthy improvisations during the development process.  He never reveals his intentions to the story until he captures it freely, and then creates the characters, molding them in an organic manner.    Although Naked is a fairly heavy movie by mainstream standards, its subject matter is highly socially relevant, emotionally moving, tragically beautiful and strongly acted by its leading and supporting characters.   David Thewlis's performance is simply brilliant.  The collaboration of Leigh and Thewis during their extensive creative process and character developement conjures up a truly tragic and unforgettable character study through improvisation.  Mike Leigh planted the seeds, but David Thewlis breathed life into Johnny, immortalizing him.      If you are passionate about films, this movie should not be missed.  This is one of the best British films of all time, created in the midst of the underrated, yet highly prominent era of true British independent cinema of the 1980s.

B0002O7XVI|3.0|Columbia's DVD of Tess is doubly disappointing - not only is it a disappointing transfer but it's also the cut version of the film, which tends to lose a little heart and more than a little irony. There's still much to admire, from the beautiful Scope cinematography and Phillipe Sarde's superb score to Polanski's feel for time and place (even if it is shot in France rather than Wessex) and, ironically, sexual prejudice, although Nastassja Kinski never really convinces in the lead and Leigh Lawson's despoiling cad seems constantly on the verge of twirling his moustache. The murder still seems a plot contrivance, although it does throw in one great moment of vintage Polanski with a spot of blood on the ceiling.     Still, at least the 72-minute documentary is very good.
B000EAT246|5.0|If you're a \\"Blue Thunder\\" fan then this DVD is the only version for you. This special edition version is presented in its 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio and remastered in high definition.

The 5.1 surround sound breathes new life into this 1983 action classic and you get to hear \\"Blue Thunder\\" really roar.

The DVD contains bonus features such as commentary, theatrical trailer, storyboard galleries and making of featurettes. After comparing both DVD versions, in my opinion this one was the best. Prepare to witness an all out aerial assault over the city of Los Angeles.

B000A2XC1C|5.0|Anchor Bay Studios have done a wonderful job with the picture and sound transfers in this newly remastered anniversary DVD edition. The video transfer presented from Anchor Bay in 2.35:1 widescreen is truly amazing. The colors are incredibly sharp, vibrant and simply outstanding; especially in the toy shop scenes. In the toy shop the colors just pop out at you. This is the best I've ever seen this movie look. The new Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound gives this old holiday classic new life. This 20th anniversary DVD edition is filled with extra bonus material making it even more enjoyable to watch. This is one Christmas movie the whole family can watch again and again.    In my opinion \\"Santa Claus\\" the Movie is highly underrated. I don't know why critics disliked it so much. It's become a Christmas classic at my house and it never fails to entertain. Every year around Christmas time, I look forward to watching this movie with my family and friends. I love the story. It's about a woodcarver and his wife who become stranded during a snow storm. They are rescued by a colony of elves and taken to their magical home at the North Pole. The unsuspecting woodcarver doesn't know it yet but he's about to fulfill his destiny and become Santa Claus. A heartwarming tale of a simple woodcarver who would become Santa Claus and the power of true friendship; what's not to like. The critics who disliked \\"Santa Claus\\" the movie must have been Grinches!    The stellar cast consists of names like John Lithgow, Dudley Moore, David Huddleston and a brief cameo by Burgess Meredith as the elder elf. I don't know if David Huddleston was the first choice for the role of Santa Claus but in my opinion he was perfect in the role of Santa Claus. There are numerous Christmas movies and many versions of Santa Claus and everyone has their favorite. David Huddleston will always be one of my favorite Santa's. I don't know if it was because of his size or looks but something about him made it all believable for me. When he puts on the red suit, he really looks like Santa Claus. Dudley Moore was like-able as patch the elf and John Lithgow was perfect in the role of B.Z.  the villain toy baron.       The Cast:  David Huddleston - Santa Claus  Judy Cornwell - Anya Claus  John Lithgow - B.Z. The Villain Toy Baron  Dudley Moore - Patch  Burgess Meredith - Elder Elf  Christian Fitzpatrick - Joe  Carrie Kei Heim - Cornelia  Jeffrey Kramer - Towzer  John Barrard - Dooley  Anthony O'Donnell - Puffy  Melvyn Hayes - Goober  Don Estelle - Groot  Tim Stern - Boog  Peter O'Farrell - Honka      DVD Features Include:  -Widescreen presentation (2.35:1) enhanced for 16X9 TV's  -12 page 20th Anniversary commemorative booklet  -Audio commentary with director Jeannot Szwarc and special projects consultant Scott Michael Bosco  -Featurette: Santa Claus the Making of the Movie  -U.S. & foreign theatrical trailer  -Talent bios

B000J10EQU|1.0|Wow, that was like bad fanfiction. Bryan Singer did a great job on the first two X-Men movies, but this one was atrocious. <br /> <br />The basic plot of the movie, for those who don't know already, is that Superman has been gone from Earth for five years, investigating the remnants of Krypton, recently discovered by astronomers. He returns to Earth to find that Lois Lane, bitter about his sudden departure, has won a Pulitzer for an anti-Superman editorial (\\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman\\") and is engaged (to fellow reporter Richard White) with a son. Much of the movie is devoted to Superman's struggle to once again fit in to the world, and to his angst over Lois' being engaged. <br /> <br />Why does this suck? Well, much of the movie is ponderous and pretentious, one of those comic-book movies that's ashamed of being a comic-book movie, and desperately wants to have Real Human Drama. It wants to have Real Drama so much, in fact, that there are lots of scenes featuring little more than the actors furrowing their brows and looking concerned. It's certainly possible for a comic-book movie to have real drama, but not when it's so self-conscious about it. It doesn't help that Lois' beau is played by the very smarmy Jason Marsden, who played a very smarmy Cyclops in the X-Men movies. There's no real identification with the character when he's so unlikable. With so much emoting-for-its-own-sake and so little action (more on this later), the movie begins to feel very soap-operatic. <br /> <br />Now, there is one really good thing about this movie, and that's Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. He's both gleefully evil and genuinely funny, a very, very bad man who revels in his complete amorality. Arguably, his performance gets hammy at times, but it's certainly entertaining. If only his henchmen didn't ruin much of it. In this movie, Luthor hangs around with a series of comically stupid goons with the approximate competence of the burglars in \\"Home Alone.\\" And he has as a sidekick a hooker named Kitty Kowalski, whose character is strictly restricted to being a complete airhead and saying stupid things for comic effect. In almost every modern (post-Crisis) version of the Superman mythos, Lex Luthor has been a serious, well-organized master criminal. It makes absolutely no sense for him to surround himself with bunglers who wouldn't be out of place on the `60s Batman TV series. <br /> <br />Speaking of Luthor, his master plan is the sort of dumb that evinces laziness on the part of the writers. He's found all the neat Kryptonian doodads in Superman's Arctic Fortress of Solitude, including some crystals that, when placed into water, expand into massive crystalline structures (\\"Just like Sea Monkeys!\\" quips Kitty moronically.) He plans to dump these crystals into the Atlantic ocean, creating a new continent. However, since \\"the laws of physics say that two objects can't exist in the same place,\\" the water displaced will engulf America. (Based on the location of the new continent displayed in Luthor's computer simulation, it's not clear why much of Europe won't be sunk as well, but hey.) After destroying America, he will, get this, become filthy rich by selling \\"beachfront property\\" on his new continent to the rest of the world. <br /> <br />Of course, Luthor knows that Superman won't stand for this sort of thing, so before shooting his magic crystal into the sea, he wraps it in a sheath of Kryptonite (which, according to the museum he heists it from, is \\"sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide with fluorine,\\" which really shouldn't be radioactive in any way, but I digress), so that when the crystal grows, it will take the form of more Kryptonite! After all, \\"when a crystal grows, it takes on the properties of the minerals around it.\\" <br /> <br />Now, you can't nitpick the science of superhero movies too much. It doesn't make sense, for instance, to bother (correctly) arguing that most of the complete fantasy stuff (like, say, the Green Lantern's ring) wouldn't really work. The point of comic-book stuff is that it's silly and escapist. But it's hard to suspend disbelief at a plot device that turns on a blanket statement about basic physics and chemistry that anyone who passed middle-school science should know to be laughably wrong. I mean, everyone knows that if you grow some crystals from a kid's chemistry set in the presence of a diamond, you won't get more diamond. Alchemy doesn't happen. The writers could easily have made up some technobabble about how this works, without pretending that BS is a fundamental principle of nature. <br /> <br />Anyway, Luthor has his new Kryptonite island, and when Superman lands there, he is immediately depowered, and Luthor's goons beat the tar out of him, with Luthor finally shanking him in the kidney with a jagged piece of kryptonite, then tossing him into the sea to drown. Of course, he's saved, this time by Lois and fiancé in their seaplane. That's fine, but later on Superman's weakness to Kryptonite is made quite inconsistent (and I'm being kind) when he picks up the entire island and flies it into space. Now, maybe I'm being overly critical, but considering that immediately upon landing on this island, Superman can't even throw a punch to defend himself against generic loser henchmen, he really shouldn't be able to achieve escape velocity holding megatons of the stuff. <br /> <br />Oh, and did I mention that there are, for all intents and purposes, no fight scenes in this movie? Superman vs. Luthor's men is akin to some bullies beating up the scrawny kid for his lunch money - Superman does not fight back at all. And I guess early on in the movie, a bank robber with a gatling gun (whatever) shoots at Superman impotently. That's it. Not to be crass, but one does see a comic-book movie for the action, and when said action gets passed over in favor of high school-level angst, it does give the impression that the creators had their priorities distinctly muddled. What about all the cool members of Superman's rogues gallery outside of Luthor? Braniac, Metallo, the Parasite, Livewire, Luminus, Volcana, Darkseid... the list goes on and on. A real villain outside of Luthor's Kryptonite island would have done wonders for this movie. <br /> <br />And I've yet to mention the stupidest part of this movie. During a scene where Lois and her son are trapped on Luthor's yacht, Luthor immediately suspects that the kid is Superman's, and starts waving a piece of Kryptonite in his face, which has no effect. This was just before the movie started to suck horribly, and I thought it was an amusing scene, with Luthor worried about a bad fanfiction possibility from a sickly kid with bad asthma. It was funny because I was sure the producers wouldn't be so dumb as to have the kid actually be Superman's. <br /> <br />Oops. <br /> <br />As soon as one of Luthor's goons starts shoving Lois around (for trying to fax out a distress call), the little tyke kills him by, get this, smooshing him into the wall with a piano. I had to work to avoid audibly groaning in the theater at this point. And it's not as if the kid's powers are even consistent; later on, when he, Lois, and Richard are trapped in a sinking ship, Junior can't muster up the strength to bust the hatch open, despite having recently done a superlative job at administering death by piano. <br /> <br />Of course, the real reason for having the kid be Superman's is so that we can have some emotional father-and-son moments, the worst of which consists of Superman sitting in a room with the sleeping kid and pontificating: \\"The son becomes the father, and the father becomes the son.\\" Yeah, and garbage stays garbage, especially when it makes the lead's actions out of character. If the kid really is Superman's, than presumably he took off for outer space five years ago leaving Lois with a bun in the oven. What an jerk! I mean, does it really make sense to make one of the most iconic heroes ever intoMan of Steel, deadbeat dad? <br /> <br />This movie was apparently a commercial success, which probably means that sequels are in the works. Frankly, I think the Superman film franchise might be pretty well broken at this point, unless they decide to retcon this one out of existence as they did for III and IV. Honestly, this was worse than the Joel Schumacher Batman movies: they were stupid, but they knew it, and at least they had some entertaining action scenes. This movie was stupid, but it thought it was high drama.
B000ICM5W6|5.0|At first I was not going to get The HD DVD version of The HULK because I did not think the movie was all that great.But after reading the reviews of The HDDVD version I decided to give the movie another chance,and wow The Hulk looks awsome in High Def.The picture quality of the HDDVD just pops off the screen.My favorite part has to be the scene where the HULK is being chased by the army men in the desert,the scene looked so great for a few momments I thought The Hulk was going to smash threw to my living room.Universal did a great job with this release and I have to agree this is the best looking HDDVD yet.The Dolby Digital Plus sound was not bad either.An A+ disc.As for the movie I think it's pretty good but I dont think it's the best comic book to movie,yeah it's not as bad as some other comic book movies I can think of.Well anyway Universal did a great job with HULK in HD.
B000I2IT44|5.0|Finally, Porcupine Tree fans who are unable to travel to the limited number of cities where the band performs have the opportunity to see them in all their musical majesty. With the issue of Arriving Somewhere, it is clear that Steve Wilson and Company are arriving at the top of the world of progressive rock.<br /><br />I have most Porcupine Tree CDs and enjoy every one of them. Now, after viewing Arriving Somewhere numerous times, their music is so impressed in my mind that I can hear a song through just thinking about it.<br /><br />Other reviewers have sang the high hosannahs and a couple even provided a needed setlist, so I won't rehash their efforts. I will just tell the reader what I think the highlights are. My favorite is a stunning Arriving Somewhere But Not Here, but I am also very favorable impressed with Blackest Eyes, Hatesong, Heart Attack In A Layby, Halo (of course), The Sound of Muzak, and Even Less. The tightness of play is tremendous. About the only annoying aspect of the video is watching Wilson do his Addams Family \\"Cousin It\\" imitation by constantly allowing his long, limp hair to cover his face like a mop.<br /><br />Viewing the second disc is kind of anti-climatic after the musical excitement generated by the first one. The features are short, and the viewer has to keep fiddling with the remote to decide what to watch/listen to next. My favorite bonus features are the live films for three PT songs, and the video clips from the German Rockpalast TV broadcast. The picture gallery I found boring. Though its always nice to get something extra for your money, Arriving Somewhere would have been worth the same money sans the bonus disc.<br /><br />If you are already a Porcupine Tree fan or just curious about the band, this DVD will give you a taste of the band that should lock you in as a fan forever. You'll never be sorry to own this!

B000L43AN4|5.0|Well, Waits has finally emptied out the orphange. Then burnt it to the ground. Torched it. Holding court like a manic Fagin, Waits sets loose enough Oliver Twists & Artful Dodgers to live up to it's title.<br /><br />Thoughtfully sequenced over 3 discs, Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards says it all. Starting off with the demented Rockabilly of \\"Lie To Me\\", Brawlers lies somewhere between 1999's Mule Variations & 2004's \\"Real Gone\\". Highlights include the take-no-prisoners, \\"Fish In The Jailhouse\\" & a cover of Leadbelly's \\"Ain't Goin' Down To The Well\\" that defies easy categorization. Also notable is the gutter Gospel of \\"Lord I've Been Changed\\" & the rousing hobo ballad, \\"Bottom Of The World\\". While the heart of \\"Road To Peace\\" is certainly in the right place, this overtly political treatise quickly wears out its welcome after 1 listen. But despite the monotony of \\"Peace\\", things like \\"Rains On Me\\" & his barnstorming turn with The Ramones' \\"Jackie & Judy\\" are guaranteed to have you coming back for more.<br /><br />If the unholy onslaught of \\"Real Gone\\" alienated any fans of Waits' softer side, Bawlers more than makes up for any ruffled feathers. \\"You Can Never Hold Back Spring\\" beautifully harks back to Waits' earlier work while rousing ballads like \\"Never Let Go Of Your Hand\\" rank as some of his best. No one spikes a dirge with bittersweet heartbreak like Waits & the likes of \\"Little Drop OF Poison\\" & \\"It's Over\\" are classics, pure & simple. For those who've heard Johnny Cash's version of \\"Down There By The Train\\", fans can finally hear the song in it's entirety. Perhaps Cash felt silly singing \\"Humptry Jackson\\" or \\"Gyp The Blood\\" but it comes at the expense of, \\"and Charlie Whitman is holding on to Dillinger's wings\\". Along with the aformentioned, the world weary \\"Goodnight Irene\\" & \\"If I Have To Go\\" are sure to make Bawlers the disc that gets the most play in the collection.<br /><br />By & large Bastards consists of Waits' signature spoken word pieces &  some truely ecclectic covers. Brecht/Weill's \\"What Keeps Mankind Alive\\" seems tailor made & his take on \\"Heigh Ho\\" is the stuff of legend.

B00007LTIA|5.0|This is one of those \\"difficult\\" albums about which no two people are ever going to agree, so I'll just say that the reason I like it is that it's the closest Yes ever got to loosening up in the studio. They had up until this point (and subsequently) been so intent on being SO precise, SO specific with every note they wrote and played, that to hear them meander a little bit is, at least for me, somewhat refreshing!<br /><br />Yes, okay, Jon Anderson was in cloud-cuckooland when he wrote most of the lyrics here (like there was anything coherent about \\"Close To The Edge\\" or \\"Roundabout?\\"), but his main thing at the time was the way words SOUNDED when sung, not the meaning, and, on that level, much of his singing works just fine. Alan White was making his studio debut with the group and brought a more muscular approach to the drumming that was in stark contrast to his predecessor Bill Bruford's almost military-clean topkit drumming. I like both Bruford and White, but one of things that stands out on TOPOGRAPHIC is it's almost savage sound, especially on the third piece, \\"The Ancient,\\" and White was a great contributor to that aspect of it. Steve Howe also dared to let his guitar get a bit ugly-sounding here, and it works! For all that Rick Wakeman had nothing good to say about TOPOGRAPHIC at the time he worked on it, his playing and use of the mellotron and synths throughout is probably the most lyrical and emotionally uplifting part of all four pieces. By contrast to the others, and to his previous work on other Yes albums, bassist Chris Squire seems more subdued here, but even that works well on pieces like \\"The Remembering,\\" and when he lets loose on the final moments of \\"Ritual,\\" the wait for him to do so is worth it.<br /><br />I would rate Yes' albums from THE YES ALBUM through GOING FOR THE ONE as some of the most played in my music collection, but TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS is the first among equals....sprawl and all!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is the sole reason I picked up Amazon Unbox episodes of Firefly in the first place. If a movie can intrigue one as much so that they acquire interest in its creation and origin, then it must be pretty enthralling, don't you think? I wanted to learn more, have more, and I was not disappointed. It's a good watch for both avid Firefly fans and newcomers  alike.
B00006IU73|5.0|Okay, that's a stretch, I guess. However, I must say one thing: I am not a big fan of the genre. I usually find that excess ruins bands like Dream Theater, and that talent shouldn't be an excuse to make tracks full of musical wanking. Also, prog-rock fans tend to irritate me with their genearlization of music as simple=bad, complex=good, and an overall holier-than-thou attitude. I'll tell you what's good about Porcupine Tree and \\"In Absentia\\": None of the moments here are wasted or seem overly self-indulgent. Also, they don't pretentiously try showing you how individually talented they are; you can just hear that by listening to the songs. The group shouldn't even be pigeonholed into a genre. Simply, they are Porcupine Tree. There are elements of alternative rock, heavy metal, and some atmospheric electronics occasionally thrown in the mix. <br /> <br />Also, other good things about Porcupine Tree is rather than having a silly, melodramatic vocalist, Steven Wilson does not have to show you his range and sounds great through this whole record. The tracks actually are focused on songwriting, melody, and have hooks. It's not just that: Songs like \\"Trains\\" and \\"Prodigal\\" are just amazing, and the album never lets down from its greatness (check out the final two tracks, \\"Strip the Soul\\" and \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth\\"). Also, the fact that the concept is used as a backbone rather than a theme is great and can actually be taken seriously. Even tracks like the instrumental \\"Wedding Nails\\" or the eight-minute \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" show some quality and don't seem overdone in any way. Also, in some tracks, the bass sounds very good, not the type used with too much distortion and yet it's loud enough in the mix to stand out, like in \\"The Creator Has a Mastertape.\\" <br /> <br />It's a wonder that something this good has virtually no success. Not everything on a major label is garbage and this is proof. A friend of me got me into Porcupine Tree with a mix tape of their songs, and I found that many of my favorites were on \\"In Absentia,\\" so I recently purchased that one. Soon enough I'll be trying to catch up by getting \\"Stupid Dream\\" and \\"Deadwing.\\" These tracks are all worth repeating and I can tell you I will not stop with this PT album.
B00004XMTJ|2.0|I enjoy live opera, but I don't like to listen to recorded opera.  Something dies in the translation.  Cats is similar.  I can't put my finger on it, but something about this long running musical does not translate well when recorded.  I imagine that millions of people who have seen the play will want this video.  However, to be honest, my guess is that they want it as a souvenir, to remember the live performance and to show their friends.  If you have seen the play purchase the video.  For the millions who have not seen the play but have heard enough about it to be interested, do not get the video.  This exposure does not do the play justice and will tarnish the experience for you.
B000J103PC|3.0|I went with the wife to see this back in the summer and enjoyed it so much we caught it a second time and just bought the dvd. I was surprised at how un-chick flick like it was. This is a well made if slightly corny (especially the less-than-satisfying ending) tale of self-discovery. The acting is top notch with Anne Hathaway being the weakest link. Her character has little to convey emotionally and she does a fair job of just that, but the other three major characters at Runway magazine are worth the price of admission. They save what might've been a cliche and turn it into a fun exploration of the world of fashion. Granted, some deep ideas (the double standard applied to powerful women, chosing between career and love) are glossed over, remember it is a fluffy movie based on a fluffy novel, so approach it as such.<br /><br />I agree with the general sentiment that (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Andrea should have blown off her painfully immature friends and gone for rhe gold, having the foresight to know that her relationship with the boyfriend wasn't going anywhere anyway, but she gives in to the picket fence and Hallmark duldrums instead of seizing the brass ring when it is so clearly within her view, but this is overanalysis where it is clearly not called for. Enjoy it for the light and fun treat it was intended to be - in that it succeeds quite pleasantly.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|'Cabaret', beyond being the greatest film musical of all time, is one of the best movies ever made. It's multi-faceted plot allows it to be many things: glitzy but dramatic, frivolous but topical, bawdy but romantic, and humane but violent. Set in Germany while the Nazis are climbing to power, Cabaret focuses on Brian, an idealistic but confused Brit who becomes entangled with his charismatic neighbor, the divine Sally Bowles -- played to perfection by Liza Minnelli (who deservedly won an Oscar for Best Actress for her work). Sally is an aspiring actress working as a call girl / cabaret singer at the seedy Kit Kat Klub, overseen by the enigmatic, impish MC played by the inimitable Joel Grey (who also garnered an Oscar), a performance whose shadow looms large over any actor who has tried to take on the role in Broadway reincarnations since. Sally's innocent, doe-like eyes bely the difficulties of her situation and the political strife that is rising all over Germany (Sally, like several other characters in the film, doesn't take the Nazi threat seriously). Through the travails of Brian and Sally's relationship the film makes numerous pointed references to human nature and how inaction can lead to tragedy. The film also deals very heavily with intolerance -- not just of religion and race, but of sexuality (a truly bold step for a film of its time). Sprinkled throughout are some of the best and most intelligent songs musicals have to offer. My personal favorites are Sally's cautiously optimistic \\"Maybe This Time\\", Joel Grey's heartfelt rendition of \\"If You Could See Her\\"  -- a romantic ode whose last line brilliantly makes a statement on the idiocy of intolerance -- and Minnelli's showstopping finale: \\"Cabaret\\". All of the musical numbers are flawless. The singing, the staging and the cinematography capture them brilliantly, and this is a credit to the genius filmmaking of Bob Fosse. Many might be surprised to discover that Fosse beat Francis Ford Coppola's directing of 'The Godfather' to take home the Best Director Oscar that year, but anyone who watches 'Cabaret' would have to agree with the Academy's decision. Fosse added his signature style to Cabaret and crafted an effecting, timeless, and relevant motion picture classic as unique as it is heartbreaking.f 'The Godfather' to take home the Best Director Oscar that year, but anyone who watches 'Cabaret' would have to agree with the Academy's decision.

B000J4QWMC|1.0|Wow, was this a dull movie. I'll cut to the chase - I watch movies to be entertained. If I want to take a scenic tour, I'll watch the Travel Channel. This movie is one long boring set-up to an underwhelming ending that leaves one feeling like they'd wasted far too much time on this soundtrack-heavy warmed-over 80's style re-envisioning. Colin Farrell is plodding and emotionless, save the narrow band of feelings conveyed when he opens his eyes wide, Jamie Foxx is wasted with banal cop talk, and the movie, which tries unsuccessfully to convey the empty pointless angst of the tv show, ends up being an utterly tired cliche of a movie. Perhaps most heinous, the remarkably talented Gong Li is utterly miscast and thus wasted. Maybe some day she'll get a starring vehicle in a Hollywood film (her role in Memoirs of a Geisha was secondary) that will truly show western audiences her talents, but for now we have to suffer through crap like this.<br />There was no one you cared for in the movie, nothing new to show (South American drug dealers? Holy Creativity Batman!), and even the action scenes (way too few) and sex scenes (ditto) are sterile and sleep inducing. There is nothing to enjoy in this movie that you couldn't find in a dozen other more entertaining movies. Save your money and rent a good thirty-year old Kung Fu movie or one of the offerings from Li's extensive and far more worthwhile resume instead.
B000JLSM00|4.0|This film, directed by the legendary John Ford, and starring John Wayne in the leading role is a western that has achieved mythic proportions. Touted as one of the greatest westerns ever filmed, it is, I will grant you, an entertaining film. In it, John Wayne plays the anti-hero, Ethan Edwards, an ex-confederate soldier, who goes to Texas in 1868 to visit his brother and his family on their ranch in Texas. While visiting, a report of marauding Indians in adjacent land draws out the Texas Rangers and Ethan, who joins them. When they discover that a decoy has been used to lure them away from the settlement, they hurry back, only to find that Ethan's family was masacred and his two nieces gone, taken captive by Comanche Indians.<br /><br />Ethan goes to the rescue, joined by Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a friend of the family who is himself part Indian. After a while, they discover that only the younger niece, Debbie, has survived. Their quest to bring Debbie back, or so Martin thinks, takes place over a period of five years. At some point along the way, Ethan's relentless quest for Debbie seems to undergo a transition from rescue mission to execution squad in the belief that it is better to be dead than to have \\"gone Injun\\".<br /><br />The film suffers somewhat from revisionist history and its own stereotypic portrayal of Indians. They are portrayed as either savages or buffoons fit only to be the butt of jokes. Moreover, the character of Ethan is an enigma, as he changes from heartbroken uncle to death squad killer in his relentless search for his surviving niece. Ethan embodies hatred and racism, concepts that are tantalizingly laid out but never fully examined or explored, which is why Ethan remains an enigma.<br /><br />Debbie, played as a child by Lana Wood and as a teenager by Lana's older sister, Natalie Wood, is a symbol around which Ethan's character gets its raison d'etre. It is she who gives him the will to go on, whether it be for the right or wrong reasons is another issue. Natalie Wood is lovely as the older Debbie, though the makeup has to go, as it serves to take away from the rusticity of the film and jerk the viewer back to Hollywood. This was typical of films in those days. No matter what the situation, the women were always in full makeup.<br /><br />Still, notwithstanding some of the film's political incorrectness and incongruent production values, it is still an entertaining film and about as good as westerns get. John Wayne is memorable as Ethan Edwards. Handsome Jeffrey Hunter gives an excellent performance as Martin Pawley. Ward Bond, as captain of the Texas Rangers, is terrific. The rest of the supporting cast give performances that vary in quality. Still, this film remains the quintessential western flick and one worth watching.sons is another issue.

B000JKA0B0|5.0|This is a superb set and the concerts themselves are excellent but to be honest American fans are being stuffed a bit by the ridiculous pricing of this package. <br />This has been on sale here in Europe for a little while now at around £65.00,( about $110.00), so $170.00 is steep, even taking import costs into account,($60.00 p&p?!), <br />The problem is that it has all but sold out now in Europe and is just about impossible to track down. Your only options are to try the official Rammstein website and see if they can deliver to the states, E-bay at equally high prices or give in and pay up for this. <br />The one comfort if you feel you can't live without it is that it is a quality package and the book is very well laid out. If you're not too sure then go for the 2cd 2DVD package that includes the interesting documentary, you miss out on the book but thats all, and an extra $100 or more is a lot for any book. <br />To be honest I haven't written on the U.S Amazon site before I just felt it was a shame that American rock/ Rammstein fans weren,t being dealt with fairly with what is a great release.  <br />
B000H1RFKU|4.0|This is a crisp, action thriller that focuses on one day, the training day of rookie narcotics undercover cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Jake is to be trained by veteren narcotics squad supervisor Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Almost immediately, the viewer discerns that Jake's training day will be unlike any other day he has ever had.<br /><br />Alonzo is an unbelievably corrupt cop, a once good cop who has lost his way. He now corrupts those cops who come under his command, all for one and one for all. Jake, the newcomer to the group, still innocent and wide eyed about his reasons for being a cop, will be a test of Alonzo's ability to corrupt the seemingly incorruptible. A series of trials and tribulations await Jake that day, situations that in his wildest imagination he could never have envisioned, all of them fiendishly and cleverly engineered by Alonzo. All of them insidious. All of them criminal. The only question is whether good will overcome evil.<br /><br />Denzel Washington gives a performance of a lifetime and is certainly worthy of his Academy Award for Best Actor. He is at once both repelling and ingratiating as the character Alonzo Harris. His performance is charismatic, commanding, compelling, and completely mesmerizing as the narcotics commanding officer who has gone over the deep end and crossed a line that, once crossed, is final. Alonzo rules his territory and those within it with an iron hand, misjudging fear for respect. Murder and mayhem are the key words of his reign. He also seems to report to a trumvirate of corrupt police officials whom he refers to as the wisemen. Unfortunately for Alonzo, he has come to believe his own hype and bites off more than he can chew, ultimately pissing off the wrong people.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke gives his best performance ever, imbuing Jake with a vulnerability and innocence that is believable and compelling, making Jake's struggle with his situation all the more angst ridden. It is a balance of the desire to succeed and get ahead with the instinctive knowledge of right and wrong. The viewer sees Jake going along with Alonzo at first, wanting to please his superior officer, even when some of the things Alonzo asks him to do are not only transgressions of police procedure, but violations of the very laws that they are employed as police to enforce. As Alonzo inveigles Jake to cross the line, the viewer can see the struggle within Jake take place, as shock gives way to a struggle for his very survival. The only question is whether Jake's better nature will ultimately allow him to do what he believes to be right. Ethan Hawke's a performance is certainly worthy of its Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<br /><br />This is a gripping film, with a fair amount of violence. Wonderful performances are also given by Scott Glenn, a drug lord whose dream of retiring to the Phillipines is cut short, as well as by Macy Gray, who is sensational in the role of another drug lord's wife. While some of the film is over the top, it is a film that will not fail to entertain and engage the viewer.to succeed and get ahead with the instinctive knowledge of right and wrong.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|When I first saw this DVD for sale I did not think twice about buying it.  It is so interesting and Al Gore gives spectacular data based information about what is happening around the world and what we can do to help mend the damage that has been caused to Mother Nature.  This documentary really gets to your heart about how nature and humans should coexist together on OUR dear Planet Earth.  I wish that schools (and even universities) all over the country should show this DVD about what is happening and what will happen. <br /> <br />I really admire Al Gore for his determination on traveling all over the world giving slide shows about things that HE himself has seen that is happening to the world.  If I could, I would really congratulate him for all the great effort he has put into the Global Warming problem.  It is a shame he did not win the elections, he could have done BIG changes. <br />5 stars and A+++. <br />
B00004VYN1|4.0|Tim Burton outdoes himself with this silly, but funny, spoof of 1950s flying saucer/alien invasion movies. It is absolutely zany and quite funny. There is also nothing politically correct about it, as there are no sacred cows. The film is totally irreverent of American culture and icons. Everything and everyone is fair game.<br /><br />Martians have come to Earth, and they do not come in peace. Diabolical and deadly, they are bent on wreaking havoc wherever they go with their death ray guns, which serve to incinerate living beings. These bulbous headed martians with their own brand of deadly humour are hell bent on destroying Earth, while laughing and cackling maniacally.<br /><br />The special effects are meant to to be reminiscent of those found in 1950s UFO flicks and in this it certainly succeeds. The cast is stellar with Jack Nicholson playing dual roles, that of President James Dale and that of entrepreneur Art Dale. Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox, Rod Steiger, Jim Brown, Natalie Portman, Sylvia Sydney, Paul Winfield, Pam Grier, Lisa Marie, Christine Applegate, Lukas Haas, and Tom Jones round out the star studded cast. With tongue in cheek performances, the viewer is bound to get a good laugh out of this film.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|Edward Albee's vituperative play about marital warfare, an acknowledged classic even during its first run, came to the screen with searing fervor by an unlikely combination of talents at that time - stage director Mike Nichols helming his first film, screenwriter Ernest Lehman coming off the big box office treacle of \\"The Sound of Music\\", and two mega-stars who were more famous as notorious tabloid-saturated lovers than as character actors. The highly successful 1966 adaptation of the Broadway hit was considered quite daring because of its frank portrayal of a sadomasochistic marriage and the frequent use of profanity throughout. The groundbreaking film also signaled the end of the Hayes Code, which held a censorship stranglehold over Hollywood productions since 1934. Now in a new 2006 two-disc DVD set, the movie seems marginally tamer now, but the lacerating wit of Albee's fearless dialogue and the powerful performances still make this a great picture albeit not a joyous one.<br /><br />The simple-sounding story focuses on the aptly named George and Martha, a middle-aged associate history professor and his older, shrewish wife. Staggering home after an alcohol-fueled faculty party, they trade their usual barbs and then are joined by Nick, a young assistant biology professor, and his wife Honey, whom a drunken Martha had invited over for a late-night nightcap. Despite the late hour, Nick readily accepts the invitation since Martha's father is the university president. What ensues is a series of vitriolic cat-and-mouse scenes of tension and black comedy among the four principals. In fact, there is no one else in the movie other than a roadside caf&eacute; owner and a waitress in the background. Delusions and deceptions contaminate the often nasty comments, and the conversations strip away the characters' self-protective veneers. With his debut film, Nichols manages to open up the story with scenes in the front yard and at the caf&eacute;, but he maintains the claustrophobic atmosphere necessary for the primal instincts to ignite and fester among the quartet.<br /><br />Haskell Wexler's textured black-and-white cinematography and Sam O'Steen's edgy editing add immeasurably to the often harrowing proceedings. However, what remains most memorable is the fine cast guided by Nichols. Even though Elizabeth Taylor is nearly two decades too young to play the 52-year old Martha, she throws herself into the harridan with abandon. Overweight with a gray wig and bosom-heaving outfits, Taylor makes Martha flamboyantly vulgar and sadly pitiable at the same time. It's her best movie work by miles. Richard Burton is more ideally cast as George, who begins as a despondent, beaten-upon husband but soon matches his wife's emotional blackmail ploys with cyclonic force. Out of a dozen professional attempts, this is the only time Taylor and Burton seem to justify the intrigue of their off-screen exploits. In her first major role, Sandy Dennis is impressive as the fragile Honey liberating herself with alcohol. Perhaps because Nick is the least developed role, George Segal comes off as the most pallid of the foursome.<br /><br />The print is clean and nicely presented in a letterbox format. The DVD extras start out strong with two alternate commentary tracks - the first a newly recorded one with Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh, the second with Wexler that was recorded for the Laserdisc release several years ago. Nichols and Wexler both provide invaluable insights into the production, while Soderbergh seems rather superfluous with his fan reactions to the movie. The second disc has two new featurettes - the twenty-minute \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: A Daring Work of Raw Excellence\\", which discusses the production in retrospect, and the ten-minute \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: Too Shocking for Its Time\\" about the censorship problems around the film and how it kick-started the rating system still in use today.<br /><br />Also on the second disc are two archival pieces of lesser interest - an eight-minute 1966 interview with Nichols on NBC's \\"Today Show\\", which shows the filmmaker as less than illuminating at this point in his career, and a superficial 1975 TV special called \\"Elizabeth Taylor: An Intimate Portrait\\". Hosted by a meandering Peter Lawford, the latter program has interviews with Rock Hudson, directors Vincente Minnelli and Richard Brooks and even Taylor's American mother Sara but no involvement from Taylor herself, who is seen only in archival footage. Of more interest is footage from Dennis's screen test opposite Roddy McDowall, showing the actress already well prepared for her complex role. There are four trailers included for the films included in the newly released Taylor-Burton DVD set, of which the \\"Woolf\\" trailer is surprisingly the weakest.

069111966X|5.0|This is a wonderful book. On a first reading it may seem a little confusing because the heuristics are organized alphabetically, rather than pedantically. This is not hard to overcome because Polya helpfully boldfaces related heuristics and by following the suggested threads you can get a fairly smooth read on the first reading. The way I dealt with it was I put sticky notes on the topics as I read them, so I could skim the ones I had already looked when threads hit a topic repeatedly.  <br /> <br />I read this book many years ago, but it is still by my work station. I consult it when I get stuck on a problem, the heuristics do work. <br /> <br />For a first reading, the flipping around is annoying, but for reference purposes, the alphabetical order of the heuristics is quite convenience. I suspect that the first reading will not be your last, so the author's tradeoff was the right one.

B000H1QYXY|4.0|The 1980's have brought us so many definitive performers we look up to today. Acts like Madonna, Whitney Houston and especially Michael Jackson and Prince have reshaped, and made us believe what pop music really is. That also could be said for George Michael as well. Since he came out almost a quarter of a century ago, his music has been everywhere overseas, although his main claim to fame here on his own, mostly is considered towards the Faith record. There also was a definitive hits record reflecting George's solo efforts released nearly a decade ago, Ladies & Gentlemen, which did very well on his career. Now, another hits album thrives it way to earning new George Michael fans, but does it really work?<br /><br />Twenty Five, George Michael's 2006 Greatest Hits record, is like the previous one, Ladies & Gentlemen is a double album reflecting, and expanding on George Michael's longevity as a singer, and performer. The album includes 29 songs, including a couple of new recordings that also shine on this album. The songs here have all been remastered well, and shine brightly as they were released years ago. the album includes great tracks like One More Try, Father Figure, the somber 1996 ballad Jesus To A Child, as well as other classics. The album also does a little better of a job highlighting George's era as a part of Wham with Wake Me Up Before You Go Go, and Everything She Wants. Sadly though, like many good hits packages, there is always something missing. The album overlooks songs like Knew You Were Waiting For Me, his duet with Aretha Franklin which was highlighted on Ladies & Gentlemen, and other great tracks from his Wham era like The Edge Of Heaven and Young Guns too.<br /><br />All in all, Twenty Five is a fairly well put collection for die hard George Michael fans, as well as die hard fans of his Wham era.

0380789019|5.0|I found this book by chance, read it, and found it deeply twisted and mysterious in a way that very much appealed to me.   <br />It had a main character with whom I actually sympathised for his misfortunes, which is saying something.  The villains were cardboard to the point of being completely tongue-and-cheek, which balanced out all the dark and weirdness of the setting.  This is one of those books where you can't predict the plot very easily because the author has obviously taken pains to make it a Nothing-Is-As-It-Seems book, a style that Neil Gaiman pulled off very well. <br />I really can't do Neverwhere justice without running through the entire plot, giving meaty character descriptions, and possibly typing the entire thing up.  If Neverwhere sounds at all interesting, read it.
B000I2J79K|5.0|Talk about an On-Stage Party!<br /><br />With regards to Superior Talent, Concert Format, Song Selection, Clarity (both sound & picture), Production & Overall Disc Quality, this one really Rocks and or Rolls!<br /><br />If you're a Chicago or Earth, Wind & Fire fan, do yourself a favor and make sure you don't miss this one. It's like a thrill ride for your eyes & ears from 'Beginnings' to end!
B000J4QWMC|3.0|This movie was a little better than I thought it was going to be.I didn't expect it to be anything like the 80's version and it's not.At times it was a little slow but all in all it was OK.Colin made a pretty good Crockett but never smoked a cigerett in the movie like the old Sunny would have.Jamie is a good actor but a Tubbs he clealy is not.What was they thinking casting him as Tubbs That almost laughable.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|Umm, Gwen Stefani is an indvidual.<br /><br />The following may come as a newsflash to some, so please, bolster yourselves.<br /><br />Gwen Stefani is NOT No Doubt, people!<br /><br />And while she's married to Gavin Rossdale, when did she EVER make music that bore any resemblance to what he did with Bush?  WHY on EARTH would she sound like him now?? Marriage doesn't mean complete assimilation...<br /><br />It seems like the biggest complaints are coming from people who hate hip hop.  So why buy the CD when you can plainly read on the track listing PRINTED ON THE CD, several tracks with hip hop producers?!!!<br /><br />True, some of the tracks are a little harder to swallow.  Breakin' Up and Orange Country Girl being the bitter pills for me. BUT they aren't unbearable.<br /><br />Stand Out Tracks include Wind it Up, The Sweet Escape, Now That You Got It and Yummy. I also like Early Winter and 4 in the Morning.<br /><br />Actually, you can't really compare these tracks side by side.  The hip hop and the pop don't really have a cohesive blending thing going on...and it can be a little choppy and at times, maybe a little confusing, but it's all pretty typical of the artist, I think.  Maybe that's just what happens when talented people have electic tastes and influences.  I don't know.  I really like the CD. That's just my opinion though.
B0007PAMBK|1.0|The Criterion 2-disc edition is far superior in image and sound quality to this release and, most importantly, is the only one endorsed by the surviving creators.  You can receive thoughtful and in-depth information on the film with that release, something Mike Nelson's comedic commentary could never provide.  Plus you get the two original versions of the film, neither of which are colorized.
B00005JPAD|5.0|At long last a great movie by Scorese again. After a disappointing Aviator and an impressive but somehow soulless Gangs of New York, this one is entirely satisfactory.<br />A highly suspenseful cops and gangsters story with the main driver provided by the mutual spy set-up, i.e. both sides having their undercover agents in the opposite camp.<br />Leo D. and Matt Damon are perfect in their parts as \\"rats\\". Of course they represent different species of the rodent. Leo is the good rat, who hides among the baddies and has to pretend to be one of them. You suffer with him and are near a nervous breakdown, just as he. Damon is the smooth and admirable bad rat who seems to his environment like a good solid bloke, but the viewer knows better. Well, also Wahlberg's character does not like him, but he likes no one. This is the Hitchcockian technique of letting the audience know more, which increases suspense dramatically. Imagine the same story, but you don't know who is the bad rat. That would be much less interesting.<br />Nicholson as the evil gangster boss is possibly slightly overdone, but very well so. A good cast in the cop team includes Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, the latter being mainly remarkable for his foul mouth and his crucial role in the story's conclusion.<br />The movie is a remake of an excellent Hongkong movie of a few years ago. Scorsese's version is quite different, but neither better nor worse. Most Hongkong reviewers seem to have decided not to like the new version. Up to them.
B000J103PC|1.0|I'm embarrassed to say I watched this. Fortunately, I can blame it on my wife, who did not know that this is \\"The Princess Diaries\\" meant to hit the late teen female demo. Supposedly there is a book more sophisticated than the movie with the same title... I'd go so far as to say that the Olsen twins have probably made movies with more depth than this.     This is one the longest 2,467 hours you will spend watching a film.
B000J10ERO|5.0|\\"Look up in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's Christopher Ree... I mean it's Brandon Routh!\\"<br /><br />The '06 release of `Superman Returns' is both a nostalgic tribute to the `70's `Superman' films starring the late Christopher Reeve with its incorporation of composer the John Williams original theme and a promising introduction to a new Superman series of adventures tailor made for the 21st century audience.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer masterful combination of both old and new elements of the Superman Mythos was a stroke of genius, creating for the \\"Old School\\" Superman fan a comforting sense of continuity with the earlier films. I openly admit to experiencing an increased heart rate and a childish sense of wonder and excitement the instant I heard that familiar John Williams' theme as part of the new musical score.<br /><br />Along with incredible special effects `Superman Returns' delivers a great new soundtrack and a strong script. Add to the mix a well chosen new superhero played by Brandon Routh and a top notch performance by Kevin Spacey as the villainous Lex Luther and we've got a new cult classic to enjoy over and over again. Now if I could only find that old cape of mine!
B00000IMTH|5.0|An album like Rising, which is a hard rock milestone, is hard to follow up, but Rainbow did a pretty good job with this one. Ronnie James Dio still does the title track with his solo band, which gives you an idea how classic it is. Although the first three tracks aren't quite as hard as the stuff from Rising, they're all excellent, particularly Lady of the Lake. Then we have Gates of Babylon. This song is an epic. It's the song that inspired Yngwie Malmsteen to take up the guitar. It has an eastern tint to it, but it definitely doesn't lose its edge. Next is Kill the King, which had actually been around before Long Live Rock 'n' Roll was released, but here it sounds less disorganized. I compare it to Deep Purple's Highway Star. I don't know where The Shed (Subtle) got its name from, but it's still good hard rock and roll nonetheless, and, oddly enough, sounds a bit like Deep Purple's Stormbringer. The last track is Rainbow Eyes, a nice, quiet, romantic ballad. In my opinion, it beats Catch the Rainbow as Dio-era Rainbow's best ballad. <br /> <br />Long Live Rock 'n' Roll is worth buying, even if it's just for Gates of Babylon and Kill the King. Get it!
1582701709|5.0|Are you looking for health, wealth and happines?  Well, the Secret is in this book.  It's the law of attraction, which says we create our own world.  All the great thinkers knew the Secret and that was the key to thir success.  This knowledge is being released to the masses because the time is right.  We have come to a time in our evolutionary history to make a quantum jump in our consciousness levels.<br /><br />Some of today's great thinkers, success coaches, quantum physicists and metaphysicians provide tips on how to use the Secret to help you get what you want.  No matter what you believe, the Secret can fit within your spiritual doctrine and help you understand more of life's unanswered questions.<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers claim the DVD was better and that they were disappointed that the book offered nothing new.  Well, the Secret is simple, and it is unnecessary to add to the DVD.  The book is a great reference manual.  Sitting on my night stand, it's a constant reminder of the principles I learned through the DVD.  I can reread sections that help me better understand the law of attraction.
B00000DGRX|5.0|Machine Head needs no introduction. It is THE album with THE song. You know which one I'm talking about. Anyway, the first disc is the original album along with When A Blind Man Cries, an excellent bluesy B-side, and quadrophonic (whatever that means) remixes of Lazy and Maybe I'm a Leo. I didn't notice much difference between those remixes and the originals. The first disc would be worth five stars by itself, as anyone who's heard it knows.  <br /> <br />But then there's the second disc, with each of the eight songs remixed by Roger Glover, DP's longtime bassist. There are some pretty noticeable changes, but they aren't bad by any means. On most of the songs, you get to hear the band warming up for a few seconds before doing the song, and the original faded out endings are played through till the band stops. Oh yeah, there are a few new guitar solos in there too. The new version of Smoke on the Water beats the old one by a mile, and I really like that I can hear Ian Gillan screaming at the end of Highway Star. And don't forget there's a bunch of liner notes detailing the story of how the band made the album. <br /> <br />Buy this. If you just own the original version, you're missing out.
B000HC2LIK|4.0|Yes, it's a great movie.  One of the best Sci-Fi movies ever, hence 4 stars, but... <br />   I decided to watch this for the first time with someone who had never seen it before, thinking that he would enjoy it greatly.  He usually likes the sci-fi programs like StarGate, FarScape, BattleStar, and any Sci-Fi movie, but this director's cut is really for the die hard Blade Runner fans that know what is going on.  Although I watched it liking it myself, I realized that it would be dragging if I hadn't seen it before.  Even I would have rather been watching the original theatrical release by the end.  My companion thought it was OK.  Not the review I would have expected except that I had seen what he saw and realized that it just isn't as good a story as the theatrical version. <br />   Some people complain about the voice over that Harrison Ford did to explain and get the story moving.  They say that the voice is monotone and lifeless. I though that it spoke words about the situation in which the city and world had become, all melancholy and gloomy. <br />  I would still have bought this version, just so I could see the difference, but I'll get the theatrical release when it comes out.  If you are not a die hard fan, wait for the next release.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|I picked up the special edition of this album somewhere because it was cheap. This is my first Iron Maiden album, and I had no clue what to expect. It's awesome. Only four of the ten tracks are under seven minutes, and one of them is 6:52. It's heavy, melodic, and most importantly, it rocks. Man, it really drives along. Bruce Dickinson's singing is excellent, and the whole album sounds tight. Not a disappointing track to be found. Highlights: the whole damn thing. Buy it. This album has converted me to Iron Maiden.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Bob Dylan has aged wisely and eloquently.  His early music reflected a maturity beyond his age; his latter-day music reflects the maturity OF his age.  I've never been a huge Dylan fan, though at the same time I respected his artistic talent (specifically, the impact his songwriting had on a generation of artists).  I bought this record hesitantly, reading reviews, trying to get beyond the usual \\"legend\\" hype.  After all, even legends falter.<br /><br />Bob Dylan hasn't  faltered.  At least, not with MODERN TIMES.<br /><br />This is a record even a non-Dylan fan such as myself can enjoy.  You see, good music is good music.  Now, if you ARE a life-long Dylan fan, then of course you are gonna enjoy this record.  But even as a general musical record (that is, taken out of its context as a part of the Dylan catalogue), this album stands as a classic.  Why is that?  Perhaps because of the lyrical genius, to be expected from such an extraordinary songwriter.  Perhaps it's the backing band (plus Dylan's own musical talents).  What I think makes this record stand out, however, is that it is at its essence a country record.  Yes, all you city-folk: this is a country record, both melodically and lyrically.  And yet, it passes itself off as a rock record--and successfully so.  But behind the modern sound (ignore the pun) is a country lyric, a country essence.<br /><br />As for Dylan himself...he sums up this album, its predecessors and successors, in the final track, with a simple, eloquent line: \\"I'm burnin, still yearnin', walkin' 'til I'm clean out of sight.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately for everyone concerned, Dylan has a few more miles to go.  MODERN TIMES is proof enough of that.
B00062J00S|5.0|I saw \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" for the first time as an adult recently, you know that sappy flop that just happens to be one of the most watched Christmas movies after SIXTY YEARS? What I saw was not what I remembered seeing. I replayed the scenes that seemed to have such a magical effect on me, most of them also just happened to have Mary Hatch/Bailey in them. I replayed them in slow motion and stepped through some of them frame by frame. What I began to realize caused me to wonder. Almost all of the really special things I felt about this movie had to do with Donna Reed. Yes Jimmy Stewart was good, but it was only against the backdrop of Donna Reed's Mary that I felt he became great in this role.<br /><br />I saw the details and subleties of a performance that felt so real that if I saw some scenes a thousand times I would still be torn up by her in them. I find that I have become a bit of an apologist for the movie as a whole, and her in particular. I am working on a guide, of sorts, that deals with certain aspects of the plot and character development that I feel are commonly overlooked by the casual viewer. All I can say is this: If you watch it-pay deliberate attention to her face and especially her eyes. And, watch her scenes several times over so you can see the details. Near the end of the \\"Parlor\\" scene there are several seconds of her that I find endearingly spicy. The very last frame before the camera cuts to her mother shows a change in her expression I wish I could have seen all of. I wish Capra had allowed us to see this scene develop from their point of view all the way through. At least from the point where sweet, innocent Mary has just told her disapproving mother that a depressed and irritable George is \\"...making violent love to me, mother!\\"<br /><br />I would have much rather seen the two of them and merely heard her mother's reply.<br /><br />The \\"telephone\\" scene is the best emotional interaction I guess I have ever seen on film. If it isn't clear why, I'll send you a copy of what I have so far.<br /><br />I realize that I had never really noticed Donna Reed before, other than that she was different in this from what I'd heard about her. My dad didn't watch the Donna Reed show, so it was never on. I never really noticed her in anything else, except maybe for glimpses of the TV show.  After watching the young Miss Reed closely in It's a Wonderful Life I find it hard to believe that she was mostly offered bland/dull/B-movie, squeaky clean roles afterward. I can't imagine that no one could have seen the things I now see in this movie, and in Donna Reed's character Mary Hatch. She is just such a foxy lady in this-even given the standards of the day. Her eyes and facial expressions show a fun, playful spirit that she seems to be well aware is a contradiction to the prim and proper front Mary presents to the world. Although she won her Academy Award for the role of Alma in  \\"From Here to Eternity\\", as for steamy attractiveness, Alma can't hold a candle to Mary Hatch!y, I'll send you a copy of what I have so far. <br /> <br />I realize that I had never really noticed Donna Reed before, other than that she was different in this from what I'd heard about her.

B000GFLE86|5.0|Very enjoyable CD.  I had  never heard of this artist but since I always puchase CDs by Diana Krall, Amazon recommended her and I purchased two CDs, both of which I enjoy very much.  I recommend everyone who likes jazz to try her.
0792844882|5.0|Every now and then, a film is so bad, so wretched, so devoid of any socially or artistically redeeming value as to take on a life of its own, and by the very denial of value, acquire a value unto itself. So it is with \\"Showgirls.\\"<br /><br />This film is well and truly ridiculed by serious film critics, and it's even been lampooned in \\"The Simpsons\\". And the other reviews on Amazon.com are so wonderful, I almost despaired to write anything approaching their brilliance. But I felt I had to add something to praise this dubious achievement in film.<br /><br />The story is, as has been related so many times, of a simple girl with a shady past, Nomi, who hitchhikes to Vegas. Is there, you ask, any OTHER way to get to Vegas? No, indeed. A pretty girl with a great figure and a look of jaw-dropping stupidity (Elizabeth Berkley) should never simply take a bus. Only risking her life in a random encounter with what could be (but wasn't) a homicidal pervert trolling for hitcherhikers is THE way to get to Vegas. Nomi hooks up with a soul sister sewing pal in a trailer and becomes ensnared in star dancer Cristal's web. Don't worry, Cristal gets hers later on.<br /><br />Nomi manages to climb out of the seedy second-rate strip club, I mean, Vegas show and gets a role in the hot new extravaganza \\"Goddess.\\" My favorite part of the scene is not the crummy audition. No, it's afterwards, when she trots up to the Human Resources department and feigns not knowing her social security number. She's even rather vague on her date of birth. Her lack of next-of-kin prompts the HR lady to ask \\"deceased?\\" and Nomi does a creditable job in looking as if she knows that \\"deceased\\" means \\"dead\\" and not the opposite of \\"increased\\" This is absolutely great acting, assisted by some very shiny lipgloss over some phenomenally collagen-enhanced lips. At this point in film, the already dubious dialog hits pothole after pothole. \\"She is all about pelvic thrust...and she didn't learn that in dance lessons\\" or something to that effect. I didn't hear it too well, because I was gasping for air after a huge guffaw.<br /><br />The dialog continues to bump along as Nomi does the same, along with grinding out some astonishing bad dancing, consisting of a lot of jerky arm-throwing, pelvic thrusting and leg humping of shoulders, hips and any convenient pole or chair. Spoilers? None. I always forget how this film works out at the end, because I am rolling on the floor, howling, by this time and not paying any attention.<br /><br />Along with \\"Buckaroo Banzai\\", this is probably one of my top picks for bad films that are so bad, they are actually enjoyable. Whether you are just being a voyeur or you appreciate camp, this is one bad film that is full of entertainment.r something to that effect.

B00005JPAJ|5.0|When you think about it, all the problems we face on this planet between people stem from different cultures, and different languages.<br /><br />Babel is a stunning cinematic masterpiece. A bit too graphic at times, primarily sexually, but otherwise artfully put together, showing how we remain connected, across the world, despite huge misunderstandings because of language. It came out quite clearly that language is culture, and culture is language. Even within a culture differences in understanding occur between the deaf and the hearing, or the Hispanic and Anglic cultures.<br /><br />I loved this movie because 1/3 of it was filmed in Morocco, and even takes place there, at a place I've been to, the area around Erfoud and Ait Benhaddou. I even had friends trying out for the position of tourists on the bus. There was Moroccan Arabic throughout the movie, although not always translated completely correctly. (\\"Please\\", instead of the stronger, \\"May God have mercy on your parents.\\" for \\"Allayrahim alwaladin.\\") It accurately displayed life for the Berbers in the East central desert region, although I fear that a couple references will make people misunderstand Morocco. A shooting occurs in the desert, injuring an American tourist. Something important to understand the subtext of the movie is how rare this is and how illegal it is to even own a gun. Even the police have empty holsters. Morocco isn't dangerous, certainly not compared to the U.S. 20,000 gun deaths last year in the U.S.; zero in Morocco. Secondly, there's a comment about not drinking the water as it could be contaminated. While it may take a bit to adjust to new bacteria in any foreign setting, I have drunk the water in most areas of Morocco without problem.<br /><br />The theme of cultural difference comes through the clearest perhaps in Morocco. The pivotal moment of the movie is seen in how medical care occurs. I unfortunately can't reveal it for risk of spoiler, but if you look for it, it is gut-wrenching, and shaming. Throughout we are treated to the importance of privilege, simply because of birth. The country you're born into determines who you steal from.<br /><br />The director isn't trying to show an extreme cause-and-effect, like dominoes falling.  We simply see the sadness and tragedy that befalls us, for we are all different, not understanding each other, in both language and culture.  I don't believe I've ever seen another movie that so clearly shows this.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1566563887 Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People]]hout we are treated to the importance of privilege, simply because of birth.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|I guess it comes with the script but I was never a fan of the premise of the movie: three supervillains from Krypton descend upon Earth and start chaos. I really have to say my favorite film in the Superman franchise including Superman Returns, is still the original movie. SM 2 for me is too slow, down-right stupid and boring for me. I know I am gonna get heat from this but I enjoyed Superman 3 more than either the Theatrical cut or this more recent version. Thankfully I gotta say the Donner cut improves immensely upon the movie's plot but still a problem remains; since he couldn't shoot some of his footage this version stands much shorter than any superman film aside from Superman 4, at roughly 116 mins. Still it is better than the other two Christopher reeve films(3, if you count Lester's cut) But not better than Returns.
0765315246|4.0|The plot was a bit more fanciful that I normally like, but Scalzi writes very well and his characters were intriguing.  I am looking forward to his next..
B000059Z8J|5.0|Hands down, this is the best superhero movie of all time. Forget spider-man or the X-men films, this is the one that started it all. from the excellent cast to the legendary score this movie is the one to add to any collection. It chronicles Clark's(Kal-el)life from his toddler days, high school and later his first appearance of Superman to the world. No matter how many superhero films with more serious elements, none can't top this one off! Even Superman Returns falls short in terms of storytelling. Not to be missed on your life.
0375831002|5.0|This book is so moving and powerful, anyone who reads it will be profoundly affected by the experience.  This book was released in the author's native Australia as an adult book.  All ages from 13 and up will be glad they read The Book Thief.  Many of the events in the book come from the authors grandmother's first hand knowledge and experience of living in Munich during the early years of WWII.  Anyone who loves books will appreciate the book thief's desire to \\"steal\\" books.  I don't advocate stealing this book but you should certainly get your hands on a copy!
0446310786|4.0|In Harper Lee's book \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" you get a vivid sense of what life in the 1930's was like.  She shows how poverty, racism and growing up in a small city in Alabama was like.      The character that the book follows is Scout a young white girl who would rather wear overalls and play in the mud than wear a dress and sit all day.  Her view on life is so precise that you would think a little girl was writting the book.  She is the reason why this book is a page turner.      In the book, Scout's best friends are her brother Jem and Dill. Jem starts off hanging out with Scout but as he grows older and gets into sports they drift apart a little bit.  Dill is a 7 year old boy who looks like he's younger.  Dill only comes to Maycomb in the summer to spend time with his Aunt Rachel.      The kids summers and stories revolve around Boo Radley who the kids think is a crazy man locked up in the Radley place and only comes out at night.  Only a few people have been lucky enough to have seen Boo.  The funny and \\"intellegent\\" ways the kids come up with plans to get Boo to come out are what keeps this book alive.      Scout and Jem's father Atticus is a very respected lawyer who has been appointed to defend a black man of a horrible crime.  Their family goes through a very rough time before and during the trial with all the names that Scout and Jem hear kids calling their dad.  Atticus makes sure that they dont let the other kids get the best of them and to not get angry and upset.      The man Atticus is defending is an innocent black man named Tom Robinson.  Even though Atticus knows he's innocent he has a hard time convincing the all white jury of that.  He tells the jury not to look at this as a black vs. white trial but a man vs. man trial and to give Tom Robinson every chance he has at a fair trial.  He tells them to look deep inside their hearts and to see what is right.    In \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" Atticus gives one of the most inspiring speeches I have ever read.  To see what the jury decides and what happens to all the characters I highly recommend reading this book.
B00005JOLI|1.0|Okay, let me first comment on the movie. It is big steamy pile of turd. Horribly done and paced and vast changes made compared to the book. I suppose they did this in order to avoid what people seem to deem as a rip off from movies like LOTR and Starwars. Personally I think it feels more like, inspired by great fiction stories. Unfortunately the producers went through great lengths to avoid any association to these films that they went butchered a great story. To those who have read not the book; please do not be dilluded in believeing this is meant to be a some what similar reflection of Eragon the book. please note that was to be movie based on book one of a trilogy. Hard to believe to be capable to fill a epic, whole slew of characters in 3 1/2 hours, when the movie was under 2. Avoid seeing this movie but if you must please do not believe it to be a true translation of the book.
B00000255X|5.0|Like a time capsule, Desire contains the spirit of a hopeful past.  Recorded in July and October 1975 and released in January 1976, Desire is the final third of Dylan's mid-1970s trilogy, whose other parts are Planet Waves (1974) and Blood on the Tracks (1975).  Although falling short of the earlier two albums' near perfection, Desire has some of Dylan's most engaging and likeable music, and his most touching love song, \\"Sara.\\"  In many ways, Desire resembles Planet Waves more than it does Blood on the Tracks.  On Blood on the Tracks, the lyrics have primary importance, whereas on Planet Waves and Desire the music is essential in uniting these albums' diverse strands.   Dylan on Blood on the Tracks is a soloist with accompaniment, but he collaborates on Planet Waves and Desire  with other outstanding artists.  The members of The Band join Dylan on Planet Waves in a kind of rock chamber music.  On Desire, Dylan shares both songwriting and performance.  Jacques Levy is co-author of all but two of the songs, and Scarlet Rivera, on violin, and Emmylou Harris and Ronee Blakley, on vocals, are notable among the musicians who help give this album its unique texture.  Both Planet Waves and Desire were recorded in the aftermath of war (the Yom Kippur War for Planet Waves; the Vietnam War for Desire), and share an optimism for a better world that brackets Blood on the Tracks' tragic vision.    The trilogy's narrative progresses from first to second to third person.  Dylan sings as an individual on Planet Waves, but on Blood on the Tracks he finds himself caught in a mirror play of relationships gone wrong.  On Desire, Dylan adds a third party, the audience, as an integral part of the performance.   Dylan pulls us into Desire by reaching outward.  The songs on this album are a series of quests and adventures, all of them searches for justice or love.  The stories range from a police frame-up in urban America (\\"Hurricane\\"), to a romantic idyll in Africa (\\"Mozambique\\"), to a fantastic hunt for treasure inside a frozen pyramid by the wayward husband (Dylan) of an Egyptian goddess (\\"Isis\\").  In \\"Black Diamond Bay,\\" Dylan actually becomes an audience member.  This song recounts the last hours in the lives of several lonely and isolated hotel guests on a sinking volcanic island.  Dylan learns about the catastrophe only in the final stanza, when he hears a fragmentory report by Walter Cronkite on the television news.       The music of Desire varies with its locations and themes.  In \\"One More Cup of Coffee (Valley Below),\\" Dylan laments his rejection by a bandit chieftain's beautiful daughter, in a style the poet Allen Ginsberg describes (in his album notes) as \\"Hebraic cantillation never heard before in U.S. song.\\"  The oceanic \\"Oh, Sister\\" is hymn-like in its plea for a loving partnership under the fatherhood of God.  The accordion in \\"Joey\\" (Dom Cortese) evokes the Italian-American background of its real-life protagonist, Joey Gallo, a man \\"caught between the mob and the men in blue.\\"  \\"Romance in Durango\\" achieves its Mexican atmosphere through the sound of a Bellzouki 12-string guitar (Vincent Bell), trumpet, accordion and tambourine, as Dylan sings, partly in Spanish, about a killer's flight  across the desert with his beloved Magdalena.      The eclectic nature of the album invites us to become a part of its creative process--we do not feel distanced by a single-minded vision of the artist.  Hearing its songs allows us to draw our own poetic map of the world.      Two songs on Desire deserve special mention. \\"Hurricane\\" tells the true story of African-American middleweight boxer Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, framed for a triple murder in Paterson, New Jersey.  Paced like a hard-boiled crime movie, \\"Hurricane\\" is both a compelling plea for Carter's freedom and a condemnation of racial prejudice in the American judicial system, \\"where justice is a game.\\"  The song publicized Carter's plight (later, Dylan held two concerts to raise legal defense funds) and helped win Carter a new trial in the fall of 1976.    The jewel of this album is its last song, the inexpressibly poignant \\"Sara,\\" addressed to Dylan's wife.  In an unsentimental but emotional voice, Dylan sings a simple modal melody on top of Scarlet Rivera's haunting violin.  The verses are a succession of flashbacks of the Dylans' life together, interspersed by a \\"Sara, Sara\\" refrain praising his wife's beauty, kindness, and mystery.  Dylan recalls their children, still babies, playing on the beach; Sara in a Jamaican marketplace; himself \\"staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel, writing 'Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands' for you.\\"  He concludes with the words, \\"don't ever leave me, don't ever go.\\"  The song feels transitory, evanescent, in contrast to \\"Wedding Song\\" on Planet Waves, where Dylan sings of the eternal verities of their marriage (\\"I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love\\").    After recording Desire, Dylan continued his deep audience connection by launching the Rolling Thunder Revue.  With an all-star cast headed by Dylan and featuring Joan Baez, the Revue caravaned across the Northeastern states and neighboring parts of Canada (autumn 1975), and then through the South and Southwest (spring 1976).  Its unpublicized itinerary was filled with surprise concert dates.  From the Desire sessions, Rivera, Blaklee, Rob Stoner (bass), and Howard Wyeth (drums) joined this true people's tour.      But the circumstances that made Desire possible soon disappeared, as the places and people portrayed in many of its songs fell upon harder times.  The new nation of Mozambique, whose freedom Desire celebrates, was devastated by a civil war.  The old Mexico depicted in \\"Romance in Durango\\" became largely a memory following economic globalization and NAFTA.  Rubin Carter was convicted in his second trial and not released on parole until 1988.  And in 1977, Dylan's marriage to Sara ended in divorce, after which it seems he could no longerfollow the same artistic path.  Desire marks the completion of a grand cycle of Dylan's career, dating back to his first albums in the early 1960s.  His next album, Street Legal (1978), reveals, beneath its \\"big band\\" gloss, a dark night of the soul.  From Street Legal's first song, the aptly named \\"Changing of the Guards,\\" we are in a new era.
B000000WF0|5.0|Urban Hymns~ The Verve starts out with bang. Bittersweet symphony written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards is pure gold and one of the best rock songs ever written. The lyrics to this song is so powerful and what rings true in this track is its eternal truths. Just this track alone gives this album full marks and it is seldom if ever I would give one single track this kind of credit. The rest of the album is just as good and the verve is one talented band indeed. So is there something negative to be said about this album? Well unfortunately yes and it has nothing to do with the music at all. The book-let is a travesty with blurry photos, terrible liner notes, shoddy font and no lyrics. However, do not get me wrong, this is a brilliant album that fully deserves 5 out of 5 stars.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Mark Blackburn's review is undoubtedly deserving to be the first one to be read. It was more than the adult's perspective, but to be able to have multiple perspectives with a young child next to him. <br /> <br />I was transfixed by the graphics and artistry of this movie. With this type of animation, the simplest of movements -especially human- is often taken for granted. Not so in this film: non-verbal communication was beautifully expressed. A transformation occurred as I found myself wondering \\"where the feeling of childhood belief in the unknown\\" had gone.  <br /> <br />It was the character of the young black girl that transcended (albeit quite naturally) adult expectations and stereotypes. I so enjoyed watching her, listening to her young girl wisdom (which, with all the speaking children, you have to imagine what their lives were like with their families), and natural leadership. Every time she was asked \\"Are you sure?\\", the quizzical look seemed so much like inward doubt -until the last time she's asked the question and there's no hesitation in her response of \\"Yes.\\" <br /> <br />As beautiful and timely as this movie is, I do have a concern that bothers me, and will bother other children. At the end, there is resolution for the two young boys. Both of them are seen getting off the train, going to their homes, and receiving gifts which were proof of their journey. The young black girl is left on the train. There is no \\"ending\\" for her. The train goes on -pretty much into the cosmos of thinking and belief- and she disappears along with it. This is disturbing, and unfortunately, not uncommon. There is an aspect of \\"redemption\\" clearly felt and wanted for all three characters (remember that they were not with the whole group of children when the train arrived at the North Pole; they were separated; one child loses the ticket of the young girl, and is full of doubt about the existence of Santa; the other young boy finds his present but doesn't want to let it go in exchange for saving his own life). Two of the three children are shown receiving forgiveness and redemption; the young girl is blatantly OMITTED at the end of the movie. There is no question of what happens to her, the home she lives in, the family that she has -nothing. She didn't die before the end of the movie. She should not have been conveniently \\"dropped off\\" the screen and \\"out of the mind\\" of moviegoers. <br /> <br />I still love the movie. Her character is poignant, tender, confident, and every bit the young girl she's supposed to be; and certainly lives on in my mind far beyond the cars of The Polar Express.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's all been said before me (2743 times,) but if you're even remotely on the fence about watching Firefly, DO IT NOW. I've never lent a set of discs to someone who didn't fall in love with it, and usually refused to give it back. <br /> <br />There's a reason it's still in the top 50 on Amazon years after release. It's #10 for the year of 2006! <br /> <br />Watch it, you won't be disappointed.
0307346609|4.0|When I first started reading World War Z I wasn't too sure about it. It is written as a series of interviews. Interviews of war survivors. The last book that I had read like that was War Day and I hated that book. Max Brooks makes this style of writting work though, and it works really well.<br /><br />Amazingly he is able to convey action and horror in a new and interesting way. You are brought in with the characters and experience their trials through their eyes. It all gives the zombie theme a very human aspect.<br /><br />This book is well worth reading.
B00006RJHG|5.0|I am 35 years old and I remember when this first came out on HBO back in the early 80's.  I believe I was either ten or eleven when I first saw it.  My parents went to sleep right before it came on and I stayed up to watch it (which they wouldn't have let me in any way if they knew this movie!).  This was the movie that put a deep dread AND fascination in me for horror movies and suspense/thrillers.  It terrified me beyond words, yet as good horror movies do they take you for a ride that thrills you to your core.  Man, I remember the unbelievable dread at the end of the movie and after it was over I remember saying to myself \\"That was the most scared I've ever been\\".<br /><br />There have been times as an adult that took me back to the horror that this movie implanted in me as a child....One night, sleeping in my apartment alone, I was suddenly awoken by my door opening.  I slept in almost complete darkness at the time.  I jumped into the \\"fight or flight\\" mode and the flight took control...I screamed and screamed like a little girl throwing my pillow at the unseen attacker!  I was able to turn on the lights and I came to find out that the wind (during the summer with windows open) was responsible for pushing my door open when it wasn't shut all the way.  I woke up my neighbors with the screams and commotion I made and they called the cops thinking I was being murdered!  LOL  Man was I embarrassed!  But after it was over I remembered that that fear I felt was  so similar to the fear I first felt when I watched Black Christmas all those years before.<br /><br />Another instance when, I was a teen, I remember watching a news broadcast which told of a stranger living in the basement of a family's house for several months before the family found out.  I believe the man was insane and would come upstairs in the dead of night to sneak food and use the bathroom.  Apparently he would go upstairs while everyone slept and watch them.  He didn't hurt them, but MAN!  That gave me the same creeps that this movie did.  It made me search every square inch of my house, during the day with a shotgun!  I guess it just goes to show that a truly good scary movie like this one can really get under your skin!<br /><br />Some folks give this movie a four, three and even two star rating, which amazes me.  There really is no film that compares with this one for the creepiness and dread.  I think that the younger folks who are more used to the modern horror movies just can't appreciate, I believe, the genius of the suspense, dread and insane-ness of this movie.  We will see the same reaction with the new re-make of this movie coming out in theaters this Christmas (2006).  I've seen the few teasers and trailers for the new movie and it looks awful compared to the original.  They have to include such gore and what I call \\"flesh shock\\" to try to make something out of the new movie which tells me that the terror isn't there.  Movies like Black Christmas, Halloween and TCM never relied on blood or gore for its horror, and I believe movies that do, generally speaking, just aren't good horror movies.  Its the psychological horror that counts, not the blood or gore.<br /><br />If you are twenty five and younger, try watching this movie by yourself, alone in the dark of night.  You'll then understand that feeling of deep dread and \\"creepiness\\" that will make you stop the movie, turn on all the lights and re-check the windows and doors and the closets and under the bed...and maybe even the attic if you have the strength to do so!t gave me the same creeps that this movie did.

B000002GI0|5.0|I have over 500 albums/CDs (I realize there are people with thousands) and this is one of the five best that I own.  It is unbelievably great.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Having just panned another so called \\"movie\\" (The man who saw the future, arthur clark), I have to say Thank you for Smoking is simply the best. It combines great humour with an education and a perceptive look at politics, persuasion, people, life if one looks at it in its broadest sense. Beautifully written, excellent acting, and oh so germane to issues of the day, from Iraq to anything else controvercial.   Super evening of entertainemnt for people of all points of view and backgrounds.
B000J10ERO|5.0|This is an intelligent and devoted remake of Superman.  Anyone who remembers the 70's movies with Christopher Reeve as a child will fall in love all over again.  What I still do not understand is why this movie was (by industry accounts) a \\"box office failure\\" (in the sense that it didn't do as wildly as hoped for or as well as Pirates 2).  This was the best summer movie of 2006 and nothing else came close.
B000001EG6|5.0|I remember listening to this album with my friends when it first came out. We were amazed at how wonderfully different this music was. We'd never heard music like this before. It was a truly new, fresh ground-breaking sound. This album is still my favorite.
1594481938|4.0|The book is hilarious in some parts. Up to the end, Hornby does an excellent job in changing the readers' initial perceptions of the characters. Unfortunatley, two thirds through the book, it feels as if the story is being dragged out unnecesarily. The ending is appropriate, but it could have come alot sooner.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|It really makes me sad to give Gwen 3 stars for this album but I feel this album was too rushed, I think if she actually spent a little more time on this album I think it could of been soo much better. I really hope she goes back to No Doubt I really miss them. <br /> <br />Best Tracks: <br /> <br />Wonderful Life - I really hope she makes this a single <br /> <br />Yummy - most catchiest song
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|This was the best movie of the year!!  I give it 2 thumbs and 8 fingers up.  You should buy this movie,  it was AWESOME!!!!!!  I'm 25 so if your having a hard time shopping for someone around my age, get them this.  They'll LOVE it.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|Overall, this is a pretty good CD that would be made better by the exclusion of a few repetitve tracks like \\"Breakin Up\\" and \\"Now That You Got It\\". These two songs are obvious attempts to reharness the popularity of \\"Hollaback Girl\\", but both attempts fall flat. Both songs, along with \\"Yummy\\" (think Kelis' \\"Milkshake\\") might appeal to the \\"solo\\" Gwen Stefani fanbase, but this attempt at a more hip-hop sound ultimately disappointed me. Enough with the Pharrell William's-produced minimalist beeping and booping already! <br /> <br />The best tracks on this album are the ones that evoke the \\"No Doubt\\" sound. \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\", \\"4 in the Morning\\", and \\"Fluorescent\\" are three standout tracks, and it's no wonder that they are all produced by Gwen Stefani's No Doubt bandmate, Tony Kanal. \\"Early Winter\\" is easily the best track on the album, and would fit perfectly into No Doubt's Return of Saturn era. Also nice is the title track, which features a cameo by Akon.  <br /> <br />Either way, there are enough good tracks on this album to satisfy Gwen's newer fans as well as the old school No Doubt fans.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000067CPX|5.0|Rock music around 2002 was in dire need of melody coming back into the fold after years of non-melodic percussive beats on fuzz guitars and lyrics that stunk of ignorant trailer park babblings which was found in Godsmack, Korn and Linkin Park's god-awful spoiled brat mumbo-jumbo.  The Chili Peppers offered the alternative with By The Way and it seems like it broke ground with allowing melody to creep back into music.  Californication did it somewhat, but that one was too \\"Blood Sugar-ish\\".  By The Way got it right.  Green Day's American Idiot gets a lot of credit for putting catchy melody back into rock, but I feel By The Way kicked it off while being under the radar, hence people not knowing at the time that's what it was doing.  Sort of like how Sgt. Pepper is credited with ethereal sonic orgies in the late 60's when in reality Pet Sounds got it moving.  I'd say By The Way is the Chili's best since B.S.S.M.  Or even better because the maturity is obvious yet it's fun, catchy and the lyrics have quite a bit of meaning.  Most of the credit goes to Brian Wilson/Jimi Hendrix guru Chili guitarist John Frusciante for taking those two very different influences and melting them together perfectly with this album.   If you like Green Day (post Nimrod), Killers, The Who, White Stripes, Beach Boys (post cars 'n surf) or Pink Floyd, get By The Way.  You won't be disappointed.  It's probably one of the most colorful and warm sounding albums since Nirvana's Nevermind.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Every year has at least one quirky movie that really captures your heart and imagination, and as 2006 grinds to a close, it's time for \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\"<br /><br />Yes, it's another dark comedy about a quirky, dysfunctional family. But \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" approaches the family dysfunction from a bizarre, smart, and sometimes slightly nuts perspective. This indie movie deserves all the credit that is being heaped on it -- it's truly glorious.<br /><br />Richard (Greg Kinnear) is an anxious motivational speaker who talks a lot about \\"winners\\" and \\"losers,\\" which is pretty funny when one considers that his family is full of oddities. His wife Sheryl (Toni Colette) is on edge as Richard inflicts his nine-step program on the family, and her Proust-scholar brother has just arrived, after a failed suicide attempt.<br /><br />And then there's little Olive (Abigail Breslin) -- she's wants to be in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and is being coached by her outspoken, heroin-snorting grandfather. When she gets into the pageant, the family piles into a minibus to go to Redondo Beach. Unfortunately, the trip exposes all the problems they have -- death, disappointment, suicide and lost dreams. And a broken clutch.<br /><br />If you're going to make a dark comedy about a family, then for crying out loud, give it a heart. \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" realizes this, in a little family world where a wordless hug speaks more than dozens of empty lines. These people drive each other crazy, don't ever communicate, but they really do love each other -- yes, even foulmouthed Grandpa.<br /><br />But lest anyone think it's syrupy, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris wrap it in a wicked cocoon of clever humor. \\"Sarcasm is the refuge of losers,\\" Richard says smugly, only to receive a sarcastic \\"REALLY?\\" He's not the only one: each character has his or her own odd spots, and a unique way of expressing it. (\\"High school's your prime suffering years! You don't get better suffering than that!\\").<br /><br />And while a road trip sounds dull, Dayton and Faris drop little incidents through it that keep it fresh, even if it's just hiccups from the horn. The climax of the strangeness is the \\"Fawlty Towers\\"esque smuggling of a dead body, and a truly surreal song-and-dance sequence. It has to score a 9.5 on the \\"bizarre endings\\" scale.<br /><br />Abigail Breslin is a simply brilliant little actress -- cute, yet not cutesy -- and she tends to fill up the screen with her natural appeal. The other actors wear their parts like comfy old sweaters, such as Colette's weary mother and her business-obsessed hubby, not to mention Alan Arkin's priceless turn as the drug-snorting patriarch.<br /><br />\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is a comedy as dark as it is funny, but somehow it never becomes depressing. Instead, it's a little gem of an indie film.ffering than that!\\"). <br /> <br />And while a road trip sounds dull, Dayton and Faris drop little incidents through it that keep it fresh, even if it's just hiccups from the horn.

B000HT386M|5.0|I loved this movie. The last part of the movie was very suprising with the drama. The drama is what made this movie so good. The end part of the movie was so serious. I liked how it gave you the look into what makes life worth living and not to miss the most important parts, your family. Great humor and originality in this movie. I definitly recommend this movie.<br /><br />Nicole M*
079070546X|5.0|This movie puts me in the Christmas mood every time I see it! Chevy Chase goes over the top on everything in order to have an old fashion Christmas...even if it kills him! Beverly D'Angelo is the patient wife, trying to rein in the little boy in her husband; Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki are the kids who though they look as if Dad is missing a few chestnuts, understand his zealous approach to the holidays. The in-laws are like all in-laws who come to spend the holidays with family...complaining. And Randy Quaid saves the day with his simpleton ways which compliment his brother-in-law's paranoia. Cuddle under a blanket, break out the egg nog, take the phone off the hook and lock the front door...you are about to see the 'mother' of all Christmas films!
B0009H1CK6|5.0|Grew up listening to Chic when I was living in Rome,Italy in the late '70's....always loved this band and still do....there are a few cordless mic issues but this concert is AWESOME!WHAT TALENT! Starting with Nile Rodgers and all the way down the line.... wOw! DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE FOR ALL CHIC FANS.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|My 19 yr old son bought this cd and I got a chance to listen to it.  My husband & I were lucky enough to see Love by Cirque du Soleil and the music was incredible.  This cd takes me back to that so I really enjoy listening to it but so does my son who hasn't seen the show.  I'm not sure if it's a must have for Beatle fans but would be a fun addition to your collection.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It's a good album either way.   A lot of music has changed since American Idiot has come out and for the better.  Good lyrics and making people aware of things other than Linkin Park's whiny spoiled brat babble is a great thing.  American Idiot offers the enema that mainstream rock desperately needed at the time.  Yeah it's influenced by Tommy, Dark Side Of The Moon and others in it's manner of composition.  That's a bad thing?  And knock off the \\"Oh, it's not punk\\" crybaby stuff already.  Punk's more than the Pistols or Misfits.  It's anything you want it to be as long as it isn't manufactured schmutz.  Besides, bands such as Green Day is the \\"starting point\\" of where many move onto the Cramps, Minutemen, Sex Pistols, Raincoats, Velvet Underground and others.  Anyway...get American Idiot.  It's an eye and ear opener for those who've been swimming in schlock country and nauseating hip hop for the past few years.
B0007IPBD6|5.0|If you are a fan of Damien you must get this.  If you are a fan of Lisa Hannigan (his songbird) you definitely must get this.  She has 3 solo songs on here that I have on constant play mode on my ipod.  Particularly, the Nina Simone song \\"Be My Husband\\".  She shines live.  \\"Then Go\\" is also great and showcases more of Damien's lyrical gift of dark emotions.  The sound quality is not that bad for a live cd.
0452282152|5.0|The film was recommended to me a year ago and I put it off wanting to read the book first.<br /><br />It's such a simple story but so deep at the same time.  The characters are all so real, I could imagine every single one of them.  Griet was a wonderful character, moral and innocent yet with a growing worldliness as she realised how her life was panning out.<br /><br />The historical information was really interesting, especially from a maids viewpoint...but the art aspect was just as fascinating.  Most of all though Chevalier is a good watcher of people and although set in 1665 the characters feelings show that nothing really changes. She captures Griets vulnerability and pride perfectly.<br /><br />Endings of novels are often a let down but this one wasn't. I'll never be able to look at pictures of this painting again without imagining Griet.
B00000I01A|4.0|Times have changed.  Go take a drive to the bank with the 'Rocky IV' soundtrack playing; if you haven't transcended every ounce of shame in your body by the time your rockin' journey is over, you're likely to head straight for the nearest gun shop, either to shoot yourself or, perhaps more cathartically, to reign terror on every single person in every single automobile that looked at you funny or laughed when they heard 'Hearts on Fire' rule your car's stereo system. That's the thing about our self-conscious, hip selves of today; we look or hear something in the vein of 'Rocky IV' and we tighten up, nervously laugh, and arrogantly dismiss it.  Surely we've evolved past this overblown, synth-fest of up tempo rock ballads which uncontrollably scream about how we're gonna climb that mountain all our veiny gusto!  Well, it is a fact that a lot of music of late (;indie rock;) has reverted to a similar mentality, but the one thing that truly separates it from music like we have here is that it's done with at least an ounce of mockery, at minimum.  Not 'Rocky IV', oh no...  <br /> <br />This is utterly genuine, heartfelt passion -- to us, unaware of its own foolish, prideful dancing; to itself, absolutely no hint of such a derogatory note buried within.  I'm a cynic -- far more so than most people, I think -- but one thing that I'm still capable of, to this day, is channeling the spirit of energies, of emotions, that are different than my current emotional realities or behaviors.  Thus, I slide into 'Rocky IV''s glory ring with submissive ease, and am not only transfered to a Human reality that we've long since forgotten, but a reality that, every time I re-listen to it, I am reminded of how it is always within me -- just because everyone else is too cool to get joy out of something like this doesn't mean I can't.  OK, sure -- I'm jumping to conclusions.  Maybe... I guarantee that, if I decided to hit up to several dozen people, play them a few songs from this disc, and told them to go driving for ten minutes, windows down and volume at a moderately loud level, they'd decline from potential embarrassment; hell, I would be.  Just the state of affairs -- you don't listen to 'Rocky IV' if you're to be respected; you might as well have a mullet. <br /> <br />Anyway, listening to 'Rocky IV' in the comfort of your own home (headphones for the paranoid) reveals its joys.  It's all in the vein of overcoming personal obstacles, focused and energetic.  The type of music that you would work out to, picturing yourself bare naked and greasy, ripped as Stallone himself, with four Hooters girls in your convertible Cherokee on the way home.  It's kind of like getting in touch with that balls to the wall, personal feeling of glory somewhere within you; it just feels a bit perverse because it's so alien.  And the tunes are good.  They're keen on fun melody, while paving tracks of aggressive rhythm, and possess inspiring, self-help-seminar lyrics.  But really, they are solid; fetching in a way that (obviously) wouldn't fly anymore, containing an \\"I WILL\\" mentality through and through, courtesy electric guitars, in part.  \\"Burning Heart\\" and \\"Hearts on Fire\\" are the best examples of this fiery, stern spirit, while \\"No Easy Way Out\\" smoothly combines this mentality with that \\"doubt\\" thing we're so encompassed with these days. <br /> <br />This was the first (and only) 'Rocky' film to feature a fully synthesized score, too, and many people seemed to object the change.  I dug it immensely; Vince DiCola's got a seriously distinct voice in this arena (especially regarding film composers), and it's really an enigma why he disappeared from the spotlight shortly after.  'War' and 'Training Montage' are as good as any ballad here, truly enrapturing in tone and drive; you just have to get past that \\"cheesy\\" knee-jerk response, if it comes, because when I've tried to play either of those tracks in front of friends, laughs and raising hell seem to be the only responses (no room for appreciation, either).  I'm a fan of the most densely orchestrated, erratically structured film music out there, and I still find DiCola's work here freakin' exceptional. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is a portal to 1985, just like the film.  Both are quick and slick, but the album manages to come off quite a bit more successfully because it's limited, in a sense. Most the hokey Human drama going around in the film IS laughable; it fares best when it's in the same mode as the music -- vigorous and determined.
B00005K3LW|4.0|Most fans don't seem to like this one and although I don't think it's as good as the first 2, I think it's still a fun film. A man named Simon (well played by Jeromy Irons) says he wants to play a game with John Mclaine or he'll continue to cause mayhem in the city. So the police have choice but to call a hungover John Mclaine to do whatever Simon says. Samual L. Jackson plays a shopkeeper who Simon makes team up with Willis after he prevents Willis from getting killed. Well since Simon makes him wear a sign in the middle of the city that says I hate black people, well not in those words but worse actually. They than have to solve Simon's riddles and get hints to where he planted bombs all over the city. The film has an inventive plot that at least is different than the first 2.  It also sounds a lot better than the upcoming plot of part 4. I mean in that one John Mclaine is to team up with a hacker (Justin Long) against....internet terrorists. I'm not kidding, that is the plot lol.<br /><br />  Part 1 and 2 have more heart and emotion than this one and his wife Holly is nowhere to be seen.  But still it's  a good pop corn flick and I can't really say that it's not a smart film. Samual L. Jackson makes a good partner for Willis too even if the script has either complain or argue with Willis too much. I mean there's one scene where they are trying to find a bomb while Jackson accuses Willis of wanting to call him a prejudice name.  Probably the best thing about the movie is that it links it with part 3. Where Mclaine learns that Simon is the brother of Alan Rickman's villian from the first film.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I went into this movie thinking it would be just OK.  Paul Dano I especially never took as a comedic actor.  Girl Next Door was OK for him, but he did the amazing movie L.I.E.  It is hard to watch that movie, then see him go to a comedy like this, but, the movie delivered.  Everything about it was funny, and well acted.  My sides hurt so bad after watching this movie.  I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have a dysfunctional family of your own!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|People are whining that a lot of these new groups sound like \\"old groups\\".  So the heck what?  It's a step in the right direction after the past five years of sappy \\"Where we you when the tower's fell\\" country, garbage \\"Girl, Muh  manhood needs a shining\\" hip hop and \\"I'm angry because you called me a geek, now I'm cool, so I'm going to throw my toys around\\" rock music.  Besides, what band's first mainstream shot didn't sound like someone else?  Hello!  Stone Temple Pilot's Core!  Badfingers's No Dice!  As Mick Jagger said, \\"All good bands imitate a combination of the best out there and eventually develop their own sound and style.\\"  Is it really a bad thing for a group on their first major go round to have the Stones, AC/DC, Golden Earring and many others inspire Jet's music?  I don't think so.  This band has potential much like The Killers, Bravery and others that are copping 70's and 80's druggy rock/pop music.  Give them time.  Chances are, their future will surprise us.
B000JJRIP2|1.0|I like classic Kiss.But there comes a point in time where i'm done of hearing the same songs over and over.It's like hearing the last 3 minutes of Rock and Roll all nite!\\"I wanna rock and roll all nite,party everyday 50 times.Instead of making KISS toilet paper and KISS coffins lets get a new album out!You have a way better guitar player then ace now and a way better drummer than Peter,whats the problem?Let me guess a greatest hits package due out in 3 months?
B00005JOML|4.0|After having watched this a number of times I have to agree with the positive reviewers.  Micheal Mann has not changed since 1985.  The whole world has.  If anyone came out with a flamboyant, art-deco film this decade; everyone would take it as comedy.   <br /> <br />The times are darker and grittier now.  Nothing is as clear as it was in 1985.  I'll venture that most who liked the series and didn't like this have their head in the sand and don't like other current popular films. <br />People have open relationships now (IE the head villian). <br /> <br />Let's remember people liked the original BECAUSE it was different than anything else of the time.  Because it was gritty and real.  People liked the original because the emphasis was on location and realism, not \\"character development\\".  This is not Catcher in the Rye.  It's drug dealers and the guys who catch them.  <br /> <br />Also as someone who lives on the coast and has visited the film locations, that is how life is in 2006.  No, Ray Bans.  No cyan pants.  No yellow blazers.  Welcome to the new millenium.   <br /> <br />In spite of all the changes, Mann managed to clinch an ending with the same intensity as the Miami Vice of old.  The viewpoint was fresh.  Original premises of scenic beauty, sonic brilliance and nice backdrops were all there.  I DO feel it should have been named differently to set expectation correctly.....\\"Miami Vice 2006\\".
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This 2005 film is really great when depicting the English countryside in the early 19th century.  It's also brings to life the social realities of matchmaking.  The acting, especially by Kiera Knightly is fantastic.  By now you must be thinking that I would heap further accolades on this film based on the Jane Austin novel.  Well, that's not going to happen.  I know this is personal taste, but I just didn't like it.<br /><br />For the past several hundred years, Jane Austin's novels have been the basic theme of romantic novels and films.  There's a high spirited young woman who meets a very rich man.  She's always beautiful and of marriageable age, but he is of a higher class.  At first they hate each other and he seems like a cad.  The insults fly and the young woman shows she knows how to use her words in a clever way.  This impresses the gentleman.  Little by little, the audience and the heroine start to appreciate him.  There are always obstacles.  But in the end these two main characters always hook up.<br /><br />No matter how well this theme is carried out in movies, TV, or romantic songs, I always find it boring.  There are no surprises and there is just so much beautiful scenery and gorgeous ball gowns that I can stand.  Often, too, if it is a British film, I cannot understand much of the dialogue and I yearn for subtitles.<br /><br />Recommended for romance loves only who will love this film.  My mistake was that I was willing to watch the film in the first place.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|i'll admit that the first time i listened to the whole cd i was a bit disappointed.  gwen stefani's first album was really good and it's hard to top an already great debut album but if you let this album go on constant rotation, it will grow on you!  this is by far my favorite album of the year! <br /> <br />some of my favorites: <br /> <br />the catchy \\"wind it up\\" has a similiar beat to \\"hollaback girl.\\" so if you liked \\"hollaback girl,\\" you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />\\"the sweet escape\\" is by far my favorite b/c it's sugary sweet...that's how i describe it. <br />  <br />\\"now that you got it\\" is another catchy song that makes me snake my head back and forth while driving! <br /> <br />some lyrics are heartfelt and emotional and seem to give us a sneak peek into her personal life and relationships. some are downright silly and girlish which is what i like about gwen!  she is so versatile.   <br /> <br />the album may seem a little bit different from gwen's solo debut which may be the reason i didnt like it at first. i was listening to it while driving in my car and now i can say it is definitely a great cd to listen to.  i found myself making silly gestures, moving my whole body to the beat, singing and just laughing but who wouldn't when it comes to gwen stefani?
B00004Z459|1.0|Requirements for buying this album:  Poor decision making skills, nothing is ever your fault, your genetic destiny is to become a broke and miserable unwed parent with 2 failed marriages before age 30 or your parents took the car keys away because you got a bad report card which makes you want to fantasize fake suicide in your bedroom by landing on top of your Playstation where your cell phone breaks your hip...then yeah, get this album.  Also, you \\"memorial tattoo\\" trailer park/apartment complex living mouth breathers might like this one after you've digested Godsmack's first CD 900 times since it's release might want to pick this up as well.  Now...if your mother has crispy 80's hair and goes to tanning beds where your stepsister lives in your basement with her boyfriend and their 2 year old son who wears baby sized basketball jerseys, then Hybrid Theory is a MUST for your collection.  Goes right next to Toby Keith's Shock N Ya'll and the latest from P. Diddy in your assembly-required-particle-board CD storage.
B000J103PC|2.0|My wife brought this home and I must admit, it seemed like a very predictable \\"formula film\\".<br /><br />Not really funny, no real message to be found, just 2 hours of a girl running errands.... and forget all the \\"be true to who you are\\" messages th film was trying ????  to express...that was obviously the formula of this film five minutes in.<br /><br />Great acting and performances but nothing of any substance..... I walked away with the feeling.... \\"what was that all about\\"?
0060934913|4.0|I was looking forward to reading this book.  After all, I love food and I had heard of Anthony Bourdain's fame.  I was surprised though.  I guess I actually expected the book to be about food and the restaurant business.  Well - yes, it is all that.  But that's not the main focus of the book.  The star of the book is Anthony Bourdain himself, an unlikable and arrogant show off, who relishes the sleaze, the drugs, and the gangster code of ethics which characterize the restaurant industry from his point of view.<br /><br />Of course I laughed.  Anthony Bourdain is a funny guy with a ready wit.  He'd probably do well in stand up comedy.  I'm not sure I want to ever eat in his restaurant though or support anything that with which this character is connected.  Also, as far as strong emotions go, there was one part in the book that I had to stop reading because of the nausea I was experiencing.  The restaurant business sure is a seedy place.  If I believed him I'd probably never eat out again.<br /><br />I cannot give this book a bad review though.  It is a fast read.  It is entertaining.  And I will long remember it.  It's a ground breaker too, inasmuch as it tells some unsavory truths.  Just be prepared to throw up.
B000A6T1KE|1.0|At first when I heard there was going to be a movie with Romulans, I was going \\"SWEET!\\" <br /> <br />The movie bombs, simple as that.  Forget all the little things like Riker breaking his word to only take the Captain's Chair of the Enterprise, even after Enterprise-D was destroyed.  Forget the previous peice treaty with the Romulans.  It stunk on every level.  And I grew up on TNG.  They cut off half the main cast, and killed off Data.  Ok, so the actor doesnt want to do Star Trek,  Hey, after the way that movie stunk, I'll have a heart attack if they make another.  But if they leave the slight chance that the entire cast will be there...come on <br /> <br />And of course the major battle.  Two Romulan Warbirds come in to help, and get disabled in SECONDS.  Where's the action? <br /> <br />If you do get this moive, it's a waste of your time.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|Hit play and just enjoy. Great guitar playing.

Would you do anything you could...even if you knew it might be for only an hour, a minute, or even a second?<br /><br />This movie is wonderful!  The acting is beautiful and the characters are truly lovable.  If you don't cry at this, you don't have a heart!
B000HT386M|5.0|This movie quite literally made me laugh and made me cry. You might go in thinking that this will be like any other Adam Sandler comedy, but while it does contain some of Sandler's classic humor, this movie has depth. Some might not appreciate movies that contain a lesson, but this one doesn't come off as trying too hard. The lesson is there- \\"family first\\"- and it pulls right at your heartstrings the entire time. Throughout the movie, you find yourself hoping that there's a way Sandler can go back in time- but in real life, you can't. There's the lesson: live your life before it's gone, and keep priorities straight. Great, great movie.

B00005JPDJ|5.0|This film was one of the best I've seen all year. It wasn't your corny type romance movie, it was the non-cliche, catchy-phrase, breath-taking film. I teared up, laughed, and reminised. Anyone that's been through a terrible break up or are in the best relationship they've had in a while, should see this flick.<br /><br />Trust me.
B00000IP4H|5.0|This is what happens when an excellent thrash metal band decides to put out an excellent death metal cd.  who knew this guy could pull the grizzly bear growl off so ferociously.  this is a great testament album, partially because it is so much different from all their other ones, and partially because they make such an exquisite death metal sound.  some might see the cd as lacking in solo-age, but songs like jun-jun have some nice little solo riffs in them.  get this cd and just kill every fluffy little bunny you see from this point on.  just because.

Although , some of the acting like Kate Boseworth was poor and didnt live up to Margret Kidder,but overall I think they all did a great job. I mean who could live up to the expectations of a Christopher Reeve? So. On that note, it wasnt all that bad!!
B00005JOLI|5.0|Let me start off this review by saying that I read the book and really liked it.  Although the plot did borrow a lot from star wars, I didn't really find that a problem.  A young farm boy sets out on an adventure to defeat the evil Empire.  Along the way, he meat character's like Brom(Obi-Wan), Murtagh(Han Solo), and Arya(Leia).  The one difference though is that instead of being set in space, it is set in a Lord of the Rings type environment.  A lot of people frown on this, but I thought it was neat how the author and now, the movie combined the two together into a great Fantasy Movie.  This is what I thought of the Movie.
0393327655|1.0|I always find it interesting when some pseudo-intellectual feels they have \\"secret\\" information that 90% of the world does not possess. Usually they are trying to see something . . .  <br /> <br />This book is a waste of time. Many other atheist writers have done a far better job of detailing their position, using a logical progression and thoughtful analysis. One may disagree with their final conclusion, but one must respect how they arrived there. Harris is simplistic and patronizing, I would think that both atheists and believers would laugh at him. He is the current flavor of the month, and will be irrelevent shortly.
B000GPIPVU|4.0|After seeing Ray Lamontagne on Austin City limits in 2004 I decided to chec him out. I loved \\"Trouble\\" and the song \\"Jolene\\". Then I got his latest when it came out in August. I just absolutely love the song, \\"Lesson Learned\\" it has such a lonely, longing feeling that I only get from artists like Jeff Buckley, Nick Drake, and the very few great songwriters. There are some slower songs that aren't anything great, but his mellow style is always listenable. I really enjoy \\"Can I Stay\\" and \\"Til the Sun Turns Black\\". With three very good songs, this album is worth picking up, even if half of it is a background music type of album.
B000002KIE|5.0|You can say what you want about punk, but the Sex Pistols made it bigger than anyone else on here who trashes their style. Yes, they were loud and obnoxious, but they were doing what they wanted to do. They weren't just all sitting around one day and Rotten says, \\"Oi, you know what would make us blokes a few pounds? Lets basically lead a genre of music.\\" Nothing of the sort was said, I assure you. Not to mention, need I remind anyone that Siouxsie Sioux from Siouxsie and the Banshees, as well as Billy Idol, were big Sex Pistols fans? You can watch the Filth and the Fury and the documentary points out Siouxsie and Billy in the crowds. Before you decide to label this band as a talentless punk band, give 'em a listen.

Yet I have played it only with my husband (both 30-somethings), and we find it intellectually satisfying -- there is a signficant strategy element.  (By the way, it is a 2 OR 4 person game, not 2 to 4.)  It is well-made, and the package is cleverly designed to discourage you from losing pieces.  I have read that if you do lose a piece, Educational Insights will replace it for a nominal fee!  I recommend this without reservation to all game lovers.

0425200450|4.0|After my daughter read it for a report, I wrestled the book away from my wife to read it again for myself.  Fortunately, I'd forgotten the plot in the two or three decades since last reading it.<br /><br />It did not disappoint me.  The plot is ingenious and the characters come alive.  It falls a little short of five stars because of the inclusion of some objectionable stereotypes of women, Italians, and various other nationalities including the cold-fish British.  Also, Agatha Christie generally includes misleading details in an unfairly dense profusion for those of us trying to guess the truth in the plot, although that was consistent with the plot in this case.<br /><br />A story that should be read by anyone remotely interested in murder mysteries.

B000000OU0|5.0|In 1994,thirteen years after their disbanding,the Eagles gave thousands of fans a reunion concert consisting of their many chart-topping hits. Every overall member performed at the concert,much to the delight of longtime fans. The performance included drummer/vocalist Don Henley's hit NEW YORK MINUTE from his 1989 release THE END OF THE INNOCENCE. These live tracks sound just as good as the original master recordings. However,you'll notice an updated percussion on HOTEL CALIFORNIA. This version is completely acoustic,no amplified sounds like the original 1976 recording from the album of the same title. Other HC tracks include NEW KID IN TOWN,LIFE IN THE FAST LANE,WASTED TIME,VICTIM OF LOVE,PRETTY MAIDS ALL IN A ROW and the swan song,THE LAST RESORT. THE LONG RUN tracks are the title track,I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY and HEARTACHE TONIGHT. You'll love their earlier favorites like TAKE IT EASY,DESPERADO,BEST OF MY LOVE and TEQUILA SUNRISE. This album did spawn two new hits:GET OVER IT and the soft-rocking LOVE WILL KEEP US ALIVE. They later appeared on the 2003 ultimate double-CD compilation VERY BEST OF THE EAGLES,minus the preceding and following audience applause. After this concert,the band reunited to record HOLE IN THE WORLD for the compilation,which became their tribute to the victims of the September 11,2001 terrorist attacks.

I tend to go Postal after repeated exposure to \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and to collapse from sugar shock about halfway through \\"Miracle on 34th Street.\\"  But this movie gets me every time.  Show me just a single scene and I'm hooked.  I drop into a chair and stare in dreamy-eyed, slack-jawed wonder.<br /><br />The cast is a true Hollywood Golden Age ensemble from top stars to supporting players, from Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven to Elsa Lanchester, Gladys Cooper, Monty Woolley and James Gleason: wonderful, wonderful, all of them!

The story is a nice little mid-20th Century parable, not entirely pointless, not too sweet and, thankfully, not too strongly insisted upon.<br /><br />Previous reviewers have pointed out many good things in \\"The Bishop's Wife.\\" Among its many virtues, by no means the least are that Billy Wilder was included among its writers and that Frank Capra had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the film.<br /><br />I feel obliged to draw attention here to two scenes that haven't been strongly emphasized in earlier Amazon reviews:<br /><br />--Mid-way through, Cary Grant as Dudley the Angel and Loretta Young as the Bishop's wife visit the basement of a down-at-the-heels church to hear a children's choir rehearse.  The kids are late.  One arrives and he immediately starts to sing.  The others arrive one by one (with a little help from Dudley), and each begins singing until at last the whole choir is assembled.  That is the best children's choir that I have ever seen or heard (and, yes, I have seen the Vienna Boys Choir.)  The whole sequence lasts only a few minutes but it's a brilliantly facetted gem.<br /><br />--The other scene occurs duriing the extended sequence in which Grant and Young are picked up by cab driver James Gleason.  For good and sufficient reason, the three of them end up skating on an ice rink, to the joy of participants and audience alike.  At one point, the Angel Dudley pronounces a blessing on the cab driver and his descendents.  The scene is at once off-hand and rigidly formal.  The words of the blessing are straightforward but exalted.  In our era in which curses and worse are the common currency of speech, how often do we hear a blessing that is truly moving?mes Gleason.

B000H30B2C|3.0|The Extended Version of \\"King Kong\\" is a better movie than the theatrical one released in 2005. The two scenes put back from Skull Island should of never been deleted in the first place! They added excitement and tention to this movie. My main problem with this version is they didn't add MORE deleted scenes back to help explain some of the gaps left in the original theatrical film. For example, the extended scenes on the boat work better ,and makes us CARE more about the characters ,and why some of them risked their lives to save Ann Darrow. This part of the film still suffers because of poor editing choices. It's a shame that Mr. Jackson didn't take advantage to fix this problem. Still \\"King Kong\\" is a good film ,and I recommend the Extended Version over the original one.
B000002GXX|5.0|By 1975,when this album was released,the Eagles were already one of the best-selling arists of the 1970's. The band was still fulfilling their Asylum Records contract,which they landed in or around 1972. That year,the band put out their self-titled debut. DESPERADO followed in '73,ON THE BORDER followed in '74,then this album followed,then 1976's HOTEL CALIFORNIA followed. After HC,the band took a studio break which gave them time to work on the 1979 release of THE LONG RUN. Top 20 hits from this album include the title track,AFTER THE THRILL IS GONE,TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT and LYIN' EYES(later released on the URBAN COWBOY movie soundtrack in '80). Between this album and HC,the band had enough hit material for a compilation,THE EAGLES' GREATEST HITS,released in early or mid-1976. The other songs are good.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I remember when \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" came out. A lot of people were raving about it, and that kind of put me off. Still, I finally got round to watching it, and it's not too bad, actually. It's light hearted with a South American flavor, featuring a little bit of music by Sting (sung by Tom Jones), which I appreicated. The story features a South American emperor transformed into llama trying to turn back into his old self, while he changes (in other ways) for the better along the road. Simple enough, but that's all it needs to be. <br /> <br />A fine, light hearted Disney adventure. Worth a look for animation fans.
B000EYK4GW|3.0|I have looked through the special features on the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD and this new Big Top Edition DVD.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Ferrell stars as Buddy the Elf, a human child who mistakenly slips into Santa's bag one year and is taken back to the north pole.  Raised by one of the older elves, Buddy has no idea that he is actually human until he overhears some of the other elves talking in reference to his decreased productivity at toy-making when compared to the other elves (he builds 85 Etch-a-Sketches an hour while the genuine elves can build a thousand). Buddy decides to go back to his roots and find his human relatives, but is distraught when he's told that his real father is on Santa's naughty list. Still, he sails off on an iceberg from the North Pole bound for New York City.<br /><br />Elf is hilarious as only Will Ferrell movies can be.  When Buddy finds a department store Santa Clause pretending to be the real deal he tells him, \\"You sit on a throne of lies.\\"  This movie is full of great one liners and watching it is a great way to get in the mood for the holiday season. I'd highly recommend it as a funnier alternative to some of the old classics like Christmas Vacation and A Christmas Story, or simply to supplement your holiday movie library.
B000002UQJ|5.0|The pundits who panned this album must have been drugged. Off The Ground is equal to Band On The Run and Chaos And Creation In The Backyard. This comprises the zenith of his career. Paul's vocals are vintage on several of this albums supreme songs including \\"Mistress And Maid\\", \\"Peace In The Neighborhood\\", \\"Golden Earth Girl\\", \\"The Lovers That Never Were\\" and \\"Winedark Open Sea\\". He rocks hard on the animal rights anthem \\"Looking For Changes\\" and the frenetic \\"Get Out Of My Way\\". Paul's Hippie Beatles era sound is recaptured on \\"Hope Of Deliverence\\" \\"C'mon People\\" and \\"Cosmically Conscious\\". None of Paul's solo CD's are as political and idealistic as Off The Ground. Ths is a must buy for anyone who loved \\"Band On The Run\\". Off The Ground showcases McCartney's impeccable brilliance with no silly love songs. I think Lennon would love and respect this utopian-themed CD.

Favorite being \\"Drive My Car, The Word and What You're doing\\" <br />I've been waiting to hear The Beatles in 5.1 surround sound. It's better than I expected. A Day in the Life in 5.1 is worth the price of the CD. <br />I can only hope that George and Giles mix more from The Beatles catalog and that there is more coming in 5.1
B000IHY9SE|5.0|You can't talk trash about an album just cuz it didnt work on your computer. This album is dope...nobody get it twisted...i really dont give it a 5 star...but a 4, i gave it a 5 just to raise the average user rating back up to a 4 star...anyway, Eminem's production is awesome...Dre produces one track by Stat Quo entitles \\"Get Low\\", which ain't bad. My fav songs were the following: <br /> <br />1.) You Don't Know <br />2.) Cry Now (Remix) <br />3.) Jimmy Crack Corn <br />4.) Murder <br />5.) Ski Mask Way (Eminem Remix) <br />6.) Smack That (Remix) <br />7.) No Apologies <br />8.) By My Side <br /> <br />Really worth purchasing...(if you get it from Best Buy, you'll recieve a free download for one of Stat Quo's tracks, which I believe might be on his upcoming debut album, \\"Statlanta\\")....
0142002038|4.0|Did Ian Fleming want to kill 007 at the end of the previous novel, \\"From Russia with Love\\"?  In the final paragraphs of that book, Rosa Klebb kicks out the deadly poisoned spike in her shoe and jabs Bond before she's thrown into a laundry basket and hustled away by Mathis and his assistants.<br /><br />So I was curious as to how Fleming would resurrect Bond for the next novel, \\"Doctor No.\\"  He does a decent job of explaining away how 007 survived, but there is no mention of what happened to Tania--which is something I'm curious about as I read the novels this time.  (At the beginning of \\"From Russia with Love,\\" Fleming describes the demise of Bond's relationship with Tiffany Case from \\"Diamonds are Forever\\").<br /><br />Although Bond delivered the girl and the Spektor cipher machine--and survived his encounter with Red Grant, the total psycho killing machine--he's treated as if he screwed up and sent to Jamaica to look into the disappearnce of another agent.  A little job in the sun that shouldn't take much effort.<br /><br />Well, this is James Bond we're talking about here, so we know he isn't going to get much of a holiday out of the piddling little assignment.<br /><br />\\"Doctor No\\" has the lean, fluid style that keeps the story moving.  It's set in the Caribbean where Fleming lived and wrote all of the Bond novels.  I focused more on his description of Doctor No while trying to keep the image of the painfully-Caucasian Joseph Wiseman out of my mind (he was the actor who played No in the film version).<br /><br />I would put this novel in the same category with \\"Diamonds are Forever\\": a strong action story with a couple of over-the-top moments that, although they worked while reading it, look a little strange with some afterthought.  In \\"Diamonds\\", it was the Italian gangster who liked to dress up like a cowboy in his own private Wild West town.  In \\"Doctor No\\", it was the obstacle course and giant octopus fight.<br /><br />The best novels are \\"Casino Royale\\", \\"Live and Let Die\\", and definitely \\"From Russia with Love.\\"<br /><br />I wasn't that wild about \\"Moonraker.\\"<br /><br />Next up: \\"Goldfinger.\\"o Royale\\", \\"Live and Let Die\\", and definitely \\"From Russia with Love.\\" <br /> <br />I wasn't that wild about \\"Moonraker.\\" <br /> <br />Next up: \\"Goldfinger.\\"
079073804X|5.0|There is no doubt that this movie is a classic, and after watching it once I could see why. After repeated viewings the movie started to grow on me. The movie isn't as scary as I though it would initially be, however it is still quite a scary movie. I would certainly rate this movie amongst my favourites of all time. Some people say that the movie starts off a bit slow and can drag in places but I disagree. It has to start off with Father Merrins story or else the movie's plot would make no sense. The whole movie is gripping and harrowing. This is an essential view for anyone who loves a good gruesome shock now and then

B000K4WPCC|2.0|\\"The Covenant\\" is a type of movie that I wanted to love. From the time I read about it, it sounded interesting and I definitely wanted to see it. When I saw the trailer, I wanted to see it even more. But then the terrible reviews from critics and viewers alike started rolling in after opening weekend and I decided not to watch it. <br /> <br />I finally did see it. Let's not say how, but just that I was relieved that I didn't spend eight bucks to see it in the theaters. <br /> <br />The two things this movie does right is plot and atmosphere. Everything else is done wrong. <br /> <br />A lot of mythology is introduced but *never* gone into. The dialogue is absolutely horrible, and the horror element is nonexistant - the movie is too wrapped up in the romantic storyline (which is not even well developed). The special effects leave a lot to be desired (especially at the end) and none of the characters are developed.  <br /> <br />By the end of the film, the whole thing just feels unbelievably hollow. It could have been a great cult film, but instead it's just an hour and a half of wasted potential. Perhaps it should have been reworked into a series. It definitely would have made a good one. With a different cast, of course. <br /> <br />If you must see this movie, rent, don't buy without seeing it. You might regret it.
B00003CX9S|5.0|This film is a beautifully tragic masterpiece that symbolizes humankind's superficiality. I feel that there is no way to watch this movie without feeling a deep sympathy for Merrick. I never cried before watching a movie, but by the end of this movie I was in tears.
B000J10ERO|1.0|I have just watched this movie for the first time, and I have to say I am very dissapointed. To be honest I had no intention of really watching this movie, being a die hard fan of the originals I was displeased right from the word go when I saw Brandon in what appeared to be an innapriopriate dark suite.  <br /> <br />I am a huge Superman fan, and I don't have any problems with a remake as long as it's done right, but on this occasion it was all wrong.  <br /> <br />This film is almost a recycled version of the original Superman movie, there is no freshness to it or originality.  <br /> <br />1. The movie begins, and we see the opening credits in a fashion that resembled that of the original films, ok I didnt have any real problems with this as its a continuation, but I would've preffered a fresh new approach to this. Plus if Singer was going to do it this way, it doesn't make sense hiring a young guy like Routh to play a character that by the time his back would've aged a little.  <br /> <br />2. Superman returns to Earth from trying to discover Krypton, but this in itself just doesn't work because anybody with even half a brain would realise that is Superman is back, what a coincidence that Clarke is back too. Surely there would be someone smart enough to figure that one out.  <br /> <br />3. Supermans first rescue is to help a plane, with Lois in it. Once again we here the same dialogue that was in the original film 'Statistically speaking its still the safest way to travel.' Lois gets rescued from air and than faints when the plane is landed, a not too different scenario from the first movie again.  <br /> <br />4. Superman flies to Lois's and we hear the same dialogue 'you really shouldnt smoke' borrowed from the first film. Than they go for a flight before he drops her off to her appartment. Just a recycled scene from superman 1.  <br /> <br />4. The soundtrack again was just a recycled version of the original movies, why not create something new here insteadof borrowing the same cues as Williams, there were some different tunes at different stages of the film but there were more problems here. The Superman theme was played at innappropriate times, when it didn't really fit in with the scenes. Also it was the same recognisable tune repeating all throughout the movie.  <br /> <br />5. Another recycled scene from the first movie is when Superman is affected by Kryptonite whilst in Water.  This happened in the original movie, and we get a recycled version of the scene in this new movie too. <br /> <br />6. There weren't really any exciting transformations from clarke to superman, we probably only saw him change about twice in the film, but to see the transition from clarke to superman is supposed to the highlight of these movies. It's what Donnor and Lester knew, and they did it right in their films.  <br /> <br />7. Now for the biggest problem of all, the Suite! This was far from perfect. If they can't even get Superman's colours right, than it just goes to show how much the producers were passionate about the character. His colours are red, blue and yellow, not plum, beige and darke blue! The suite was ridiculously dark, and not only that the material wasn't right. His suite is not supposed to be rubber or leather, this isn't batman! the cape itself is supposed to drape over the shoulders, it just didn't look right the way it was.  <br /> <br />Now do you see my point. Why didn't Singer just start a fresh, it would've been so much better. This way there were too many inconsistences, and to be honest I thought it stole too many elements from the original movies. The special affects were all fine, I didnt really have any problems with the flying scenes, I actually quite liked the x-ray vision.  <br /> <br />This is what I think, maybe I'm just a purist but I guess everyone is entitled to their own view but if you watch Superman returns and the 1978 Superman side by side you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br />peace
B000EDWKXI|3.0|Tonight, after reading serious books, and realizing that I needed something frothy, in went this film to the dvd player. And a story about history's most notorious lover and some of his escapades sounded like pretty harmless fun.<br /><br />The film opens with a little boy watching as his mother (Helen McCrory) leaves him with his grandmother to join a lover in Venice. Tearfully, she promises him that when he needs her, she will join him.<br /><br />Now we leap forward, to where the little boy has grown up into Giacomo Casanova (Heath Ledger), a fashionable young man without too much money, and who makes a habit of leaping out of bedroom windows. He's also in trouble with the Inquisition for his debauchery, and it's appearing that he's going a bit too far even for his friend, the Doge (Tim McInnerny), the leader of the city. The Doge, who actually likes our seducer, tells him that the best way to evade the Inquisition is to marry some modest young virgin and settle down a bit.<br /><br />Casanova's servant, Lupo (Omad Djalili) also agrees -- the debts are mounting up, and the creditors hammering at the door. Considering a bit, Casanova settles on courting a very virginal, angelic little blonde, Victoria  (Natalie Dormer), and it doesn't hurt either that her father is going to settle a nice, fat dowry on her.<br /><br />But across the canal, is Giovanni Bruni (Charlie Cox), gazing continually at his heart's desire, Victoria. He's a rather inept, graceless young man, too shy to speak up for her. Besides, his family is penniless, as his mother Andrea (Lena Olin) reminds him continually, and the way out is for the daughter of the house, Francesca (Sienna Miller). Casanova has seen her before, as she's a lively one, eager to reform the lot of Venetian women, but she's also being forced to marry a merchant from Padua.<br /><br />Casanova just can't be sensible and resist Francesca, who is eager to spurn him, and soon he's in a complicated courtship of both Victoria and Francesca, and it appears that everything is going well, that is until Rome sends a powerful bishop Pucci (Jeremy Irons), and the real betrothed, Paprizzio (Oliver Platt) shows up.<br /><br />Casanova duels, debates, woos, and generally leaves mayhem in his wake. Will the right girl end up with the right guy, and Casanova escape the hangman's noose? Sadly for the viewer, we already know how things are going to turn out. There are last minute escapes, bawdy content that is more of a tease than anything else, and by the end I was happy to have the film be finished and over.<br /><br />But there are several small things that kept this film going. For one, the music is from the period, with plenty of Vivaldi, Handel and Corelli, and the more modern stuff written by Alexandre Desplat. The costumes are perfect, and correct for the 1750's, and downright breathtaking at times, along with authentic Venetian masks. But the best part of this film was that it was filmed on location in Venice, something that can't be recreated on a soundstage or in CGI. That's the real star of this film, and the only successful part of the movie.<br /><br />Along with the charming piglets (credited as Bimba!) and Paprizzio's barge.<br /><br />It's a very confusing film at times. Lasse Hallstrom's direction is fine, and pretty straightforward, with plenty of gorgeous scenery. But the plot is so confusing and there are so many players to keep track of that there's not really anything that gives any depth. Along with all that, the film falls completely apart at the end, with far too much use of deus ex machina and some truly stupid stunts -- one in particular make me wince, as anyone who actually tried to do that would be singing soprano for the rest of their days. Finally, there is one very glaring anachronism in this, with the balloon rising over the canals of Venice and modern fireworks. The first manned balloon flight wouldn't take place for another twenty or so years, and that at Versailles at the court of Louis XVI.<br /><br />So if you don't mind a film that comes down heavy on the silly side, but is gorgeous to look at, this should amuse for an hour or so. In fact, I was more intrigued by the additional features on the dvd -- there are featurettes on the locations, costume design, an extended scene that should have been included in the film and not on the cutting room floor, a 'making of', and an audio commentary from the director. Additional languages include Spanish and French alternate audio tracks, subtitling in English, Spanish and French.<br /><br />Curiously, this film got an R rating for the sexual content, where you actually don't see anything happening, just a prostitute acting coy, several naked legs in a brothel, and one very brief bit at the begining with Casanova in bed with a lover. You'd see more in most PG-13 films nowadays, so parents, use your own judgements.<br /><br />Somewhat recommended, say three and a half stars. Let's just call it three and leave it at that.that at Versailles at the court of Louis XVI. <br /> <br />So if you don't mind a film that comes down heavy on the silly side, but is gorgeous to look at, this should amuse for an hour or so.

B00018D44U|2.0|I loved \\"Come Away With Me\\" the first moment I heard it.  I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely FANTASTIC! I couldn't have asked for a better! <br />So naturally I waited in eager anticipation for her new album \\"Feels Like Home\\" which after only one listen made me feel narcoleptic.  It was a good thing I didn't try and listen to it while driving.  To be perfectly honest, I haven't listened to it since. <br />She is so talented, I wish this effort had been as successful as the first, but not everyone hits a homerun each time at bat. <br />But I still hold out hope that her next album will be better.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|Quite possibly the greatest movie I have ever seen, I consider it perfect in every way and have seen it many times and will glady watch it many times again. The most prized DVD in my collection, this wonderful feel good romantic comedy will always leave me feeling good about myself and everyone around me. The message is clear and simple and will rub off on anyone who watches it.<br /><br />Bringing together a stellar cast, it features stunning performances, with incredible pictures and a wonderful music score. Every scene is well scripted and well acted and fits into the film pefectly. It is hard to say who steals the movie but Hugh Grant as the loveable British prime minister or Bill Nighy as an ageing rock star on the comeback trail probably take the cake.<br /><br />The movie is funny, heartwarming and delivers a wonderful message and the perfect movie to watch at christmas, valentines day or even all year round. I condider it flawless in every way and strongly recommend you purchase this movie today.
B000AP04NI|1.0|In response to the missive from 20th Century Fox posted on down that the Todd-AO version was in such a bad state that even running the film through a wet gate could not bring it back to life, I say, give me a break! Think about it, the TODD-AO version sat in a vault for 40 years until a stunning version was made for the Laser disc market in the mid-1990's. And then in the last 10 years, with the studios more aware than ever of the (financial) importance of film preservation, the TODD-AO version was allowed to lapse into a state of disintegration. Who's kidding who? Hey Fox, how about pulling the other leg, why don'tcha!
B000J10ERO|5.0|In a word: Awesome.<br /><br />Maybe it's corny or cheesy that as a 30 year old father that I still get a kick out of Superman.  I don't care.  Superman is the ultimate outcast, so anyone can relate with him.<br /><br />Superman Returns is a labor of love for the director, Bryan Singer (X-Men, The Usual Suspects), and you can tell. First off, from the beginning, the movie begins with the same classic see-thru blue font that comes towards you with a sweeping woosh sound.  Secondly, the newest Superman takes place as if Superman III (with the late Richard Pryor) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (with...huge superstar Mark Pillow) never happened.<br /><br />Superman decides to leave Earth behind after astronomers thought they discovered remnants of his former home planet Krypton.  He felt the need for closure and self discovery.<br /><br />After a five year hiatus, Superman/Clark Kent return to Smallville and Metropolis, reuniting with his old friends and bosses like Jimmy Olsen and Perry White. Jimmy is the same scrawny pipsqueak that has more naievety than guston.  Perry White is all business, all the time.<br /><br />Then there's the lovely Lois Lane.  Clark/Superman's former love has since moved on with her life, now dating her bosses nephew with a young boy in tow.  Lois is bitter that Superman left, so much so she's written an entire article of denial for the Daily Planet that wins a Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />However, once Superman shows his face again, all the weakness of the knees come flowing back and she must make a choice between White's nephew and Superman.<br /><br />All the while, Lex Luthor (played by Kevin Spacey), has gotten out of jail legally and weaseled his way into money.  He quickly hatches a plan to create an entire continet so that he can not only make billions of dollars, but seemingly take over the world.<br /><br />Let me just say that this movie is awesome for so many reasons.  The music is classic, and the music is always an essential part of a good film.  The effects, both sound and visual were nothing short of impressive.  Throughout the experience, I felt the need to inch towards the edge of my seat and clench my fists in excitement.

He's bold, strong, clumsy, funny, and everything Superman portrays.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth portrays Lois Lane with a lot more spunk than Margot Kidder of the original movies.  Lois Lane, due to the disappearance of Superman, has had to become a stronger woman not only for herself, but for her son and, in my opinion, felt the world needed her to be.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor is a hard, cold, very mean version of Gene Hackman's version.

B000ASSDVA|4.0|I recently purchased El Cid and I'm glad I did and didn't listen to some of the reviews. First, let me address the technical aspects. This is an old movie considering it was made when I was 11 years old back in 1961. Its true that compared to Lord of the Rings series and other movies made today you are not going to be impressed. That's because there has not been a serious remastering of the movie regardless of what the cover says. Having said all the above,  I found the quality to be good (viewable) and worth having in my collection.  So, if you are expecting this to be of the very highest qaulity as compared to a film made recently then you may be slightly disappointed. The colors are rich and the picture reasonably sharp on my 57\\" HDTV. Definitely a good viewing experience. <br />Now, why hasn't this been redone and why isn't it being released by the studio who made it? The answer is given in the first few minutes of the film. You have to remember that the events in the film are true having occured back in 1080AD and world situation in 1961. Nobody even thought about Islam then or cared. However, when you hear the Mahdi, who wants to conquer Spain, Europe and the world for allah, it doesn't take rocket science to see why the film hasn't been remastered or even redone. We live in a post 9/11 world. This IS a film that NEEDS to be seen because we face the same threat Spain did in 1080AD. <br />As for the Chinese sub-titles, just go to your DVD player's menu and have the sub-titles turned off. The movie itself is in English. All in all I am very pleased with the DVD and that it is now in my movie collection, it is one of Heston's best. The subject matter is very timely. It also brings back some memories of when I saw this film with my parents.
B000FGGE5Y|2.0|Well this ones a missed opportunity, a film that in some ways tries too hard and yet seems to lack faith in itself. The director has clearly tried for a visual style reminiscent of the graphic comics, but he hasn't taken it far enough and instead of a Sin City type look, it comes over as garish with CGI that looks cheap rather than having the desired stylised effect. It also has one of the worst most intrusive scores I can remember.  <br />It starts at full blast with Violet infiltrating a government lab and stealing a package, when discovered the shooting starts and goes on and on and on ad-infinitum. The seemingly invulnerable Violet leaves a trail of devastation that would leave The Bride or Schwarzenegger in his prime green with envy. The chase scene also introduces some of the most idiotic high tech concepts ever committed to film, including internal body weapons stores and a device that supposedly changes the direction of gravity, allowing Violet to drive her motor bike up walls or stand on the ceiling, sounds dumb ? Believe me it is. <br />Back at base Violet discovers that the package she has recovered isn't a weapon as such, it's a child. When faced with her erstwhile associates determination to destroy the BoyBomb, she gets all maternal and decides to save him. As a result she ends up at odds with her friends and having to kill a load of others including the Blood Chinois, a group whose only function appears to be one scene as cannon fodder. <br />After all this the film almost seems to run out of breath and in the few moments it pauses the film almost starts to work, we get some glimpses into who the boy Six is, why Violet does what she does and what's going on. But then cast and crew get their second wind and the mad dash for the finish line is on. <br />There is a slight twist to the end, but it's not something you'll care about and the bit with Violet and Six starting their happy ever after life style ending, despite both having been killed in the movie is twee and after all the slaughter that lead to it just plain silly, I suspect the input of some asinine focus group.  <br />Badly paced with a poor script and a director who seems to be trying to build on what he created in Equilibrium, but with remarkably little success. I really wanted to like this movie, despite the drubbing some other reviewers have given it, but I'm afraid I don't. On the plus side Mila as always looks incredible and  some of the fight scenes aren't bad which earns it a few points.
0385720920|4.0|I was once an avid Palahniuk fan. His unapologetic, in-your-face style was intriguing to me, and I could cut through one of his novels in a day or two. Those days have long since passed since my discovery of more profound literature, but Choke still remains a memorable and favorite read of mine.    One might think it hard to find depth in a book that is based around the life of a sex addict--someone who takes a great deal at face value and never bothers to consider its depth. However, Victor is Palahniuk's most intriguing and genuine character in a gallery of basically superficial and unexceptional caricatures. He is the only character I felt for in any of Palahniuk's works, and the only one I was able to identify with on a base human level.    Choke is a book which--despite it's very Palahniuk ending--the reader can feel satisfied with when all is said and done. Although the book is appropriately absurd in many ways, it does not stretch itself beyond reason like, say, Invisible Monsters or Lullaby. The debasement of normalcy and common morality in a realistic setting serves as a wonderful background to this story about a cast of characters who are stumbling towards nirvana (or the Palahniuk equivalent thereof).
1594200823|5.0|Easy to read book.  Although the beginning is slow, with more than you ever wanted to know about corn, it is a real eye-opener.  Although I am still an omnivore (yes, I'll eat meat, fish, McDonald's, cheap food, fancy food...) I am more aware of what I am choosing to eat.  The book is not preachy or an attempt to convert you.  It allows the reader to reflect for himself on the omnivorous decisions he makes every day.

B00068NVI4|5.0|This DVD is an extraordinary masterpiece, exemplary of the Yes phenomenon that has captured the progressive rock world for the last 37 years. The classic lineup of Jon Anderson, Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White returns in this live performance recorded in Boston, MA in 2004.<br /><br />Performing on a stage designed by Roger Dean (who has also created much of the artwork on Yes album covers), Yes traverses from classic stage setup to a special \\"unplugged\\" set, back to the original. This versatility and prowess demonstrates why Yes is one of the few bands that doesn't need \\"bells and whistles\\" onstage and instead, relies on the sheer virtuosity of their craft. The band's odd time-signatures, flowing bass lines and lightning-fast guitar riffs are accompanied by Rick Wakeman's legendary performance on keyboards; Wakeman is no less than mesmerizing. Together, they are anchored by Alan White, who provides a solid and flawless backing on drums/percussion.<br /><br />While the band members may have aged chronologically, they are still as tight-knit a group musically as they were when they originally created this music. One can simply close one's eyes while watching this and not be able to tell the difference between the music emanating from the DVD and the Yes of \\"yesterday\\". Jon Anderson's vocal performance is stellar and he is one of the few lead vocalists that has not lost his ability to reach the higher end of the spectrum. Of noteworthy mention is the backing vocal section of Chris Squire and Steve Howe; it is this unique harmonic unity that has kept Yes at a rare forefront for the past 37 years.<br /><br />Overall, the video and sound quality are excellent. I recommend watching this in 5.1, as the \\"live\\" performance will be definitely be more robust.<br /><br />This is both for old and new Yes fans, as well as those interested in seeing \\"live\\" superior musicianship, firsthand.<br /><br />**Update: 2/21/2007 -- I think it's a disservice to Yes, Amazon and prospective buyers of this product for reviewers to watch this DVD objectively, and expect to see Yes appearing unchanged from 1979, as several have. As a prime example of this, it's unfair to take shots at Alan White and say that his playing is not what it used to be, 25 years ago. I saw his drumming in this as well as \\"House of Yes -- Live at the House of Blues (1999)\\" and frankly, I thought his playing was excellent in both. Likewise, for Steve Howe, Jon Anderson and Chris Squire.<br /><br />The band members of Yes and older bands are human beings as well as artists; they are not superhuman and they age just like the rest of us. Musical performance should be judged in proportion to this DVD; not how others wish to perceive them. They are very remarkable musicians and I saw absolutely nothing wrong with their abilities.uct for reviewers to watch this DVD objectively, and expect to see Yes appearing unchanged from 1979, as several have.

B000KC86F4|5.0|The Blu-Ray version has a Spectacular picture with strong surround sound to match. If you want to test your Hi-Def TV, try this one on Blu-Ray. The only way to make this picture better is to shoot it with Hi-Def Digital cameras. <br /> <br />This movie can be watched by those who have not seen the previous two movies. There is enough flashback to fill in most of the story background and this movie has a good enough story along with fast-paced action to stand by it's self. I had only seen the second movie before watching this, and did not feel lost for backstory. <br /> <br />They even left a tease at the end which could lead to another sequel. Enjoy!
B000A59PMO|4.0|I was introduced to this show one day when I caught part of the 2nd last episode of this season on tv.  I found it so interesting that I went out and bought the dvd set and held off on watching it until I forgot the spoilers I had seen. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed watching this show.  Each episode was very interesting and I always looked forward to the next episode.  The show has a nice mix of mystery, action, humor, and romance. I can't wait to see season 2.
B000IYV1ME|2.0|I rented this by mail, after an hour of disjointed scenes, I popped it out of the DVD player for something better. Like the late news.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Before you start reading, a couple things you should know about this review:  #1) I haven't bought or listened to the entire album; #2) Other than having heard of the band, I don't really know much of their stuff, including anything from the first album; #3) I'm mostly a classical music nut, but I have this constant vacillation between loving the truly great, lasting, disciplined music of the \\"classical\\" world (that includes all periods not just the properly \\"classical\\" period of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven) and needing to hear good, energetic, driving, passionate popular music (radio music of all genres); #4) This review is only about the single \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" <br /> <br />Ok, with all that out of the way, let me just say that, when it comes to popular music, I usually just listen to the radio, listen to whatever is current in hopes of finding something of lasting value.  That rarely happens, but usually I enjoy what I hear and just kind of go with the flow.  The latest from Justin Timberlake, or Eminem, or Beyonce, or Green Day is usually a welcome distraction from the annoying drivers in Dallas.  I can remember kind of hearing parts of \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" in my car a couple times and thinking that it sounded interesting and, in a weird way, inspiring.  And then, at some point (you know how this goes), I started wanting to hear the song, started listening for it.  And the first time I really \\"heard\\" it after that happened, the first time I really \\"listened\\" to the song itself, I was absolutely floored.   <br /> <br />What caught my attention first was the grand, overarching, nearly perfect musical \\"architecture,\\" or construction of the piece.  There is some kind of genius at work here.  The build-up of musical drama in this song is just fantastic and nearly unbearable at points.  The opening slow ballad has reminiscences of the opening \\"ballad\\" of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody (no coincidence that a lot of people mention Freddy Mercury and Queen's bombastic musical style when they talk about this album).  Though the proportions are different (with Bohemian Rhapsody the ballad is much longer), the \\"feel\\" is similar.   <br /> <br />The ballad is almost a self-contained piece (after all, it's almost 2 minutes in length), but it is certainly not \\"complete\\" in itself and what comes after is absolutely necessary to the sense of wholeness of the song.  The buildup of the ballad is fabulous, from just piano and vocals, to the addition of drums (playing the \\"marching band\\" type of cadence) with quiet guitar, to the addition of guitar playing a type of \\"counter melody\\" to the shift in register and intensity of the vocals when the opening lyrics are repeated.   <br /> <br />The shift into the driving rock part of the song is again reminiscent of Queen (though the driving, guitar-driven insistence has strong echoes of Green Day also), and the main part of this section is solid in itself and plays with the theme of death that is so prominent in My Chemical Romance's music in general.  But the really breathtaking move in the song comes with the \\"bridge\\" section that begins with the key change at the lyrics \\"On and on we carry....\\"  The bridge is, again, solid, if not entirely surprising.  But what it leads to is not a repeat of the chorus but rather a dramatic shift in tempo, a brilliant slowing down of the music characterized by a repeated upward-moving melodic motif that takes over at the words \\"Do or die, you'll never make me.\\"  Here is where the comparisons with the techniques of the music of musical theater (and hence the comparisons with Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" album, inspired as it was by musical theater) become perhaps most apt.  What came to my mind almost immediately when I heard this shift was a similar combination of musical motifs (though perhaps united more closely and not as \\"sectioned\\" off as in \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\") in the equally bombastic \\"One Day More\\" from Les Miserables, one of themost intensely brilliant (and meaningful) of all musicals.  If you want to hear the most exact parallel, listen to the musical motif and the shift in tempo introduced into \\"One Day More\\" by the lines sung by Javert and the Thenardiers about two minutes in (\\"one more day to revolution\\" are the lyrics that start it).  This musical motif is repeated later in the song with everything else surrounding it, in the way that \\"Black Parade\\" combines the musical motifs in its end too.  Just incredible that \\"pop music\\" can have this kind of connection with the more serious (at least in the case of Les Mis) world of the theater, though Frank Wildhorn's musicals prove that pop music and musical theater have always been in some kind of close relationship.   <br /> <br />The return of the chorus is brilliant.  It has another great buildup of dramatic effect preceding it, with the almost screamed lyrics \\"I don't care\\" leading into the final repeat of the chorus.  And finally, in a move reminiscent of the techniques of the \\"classical\\" era (Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven) of classical music, the bridge \\"do or die\\" combines with \\"we'll carry on\\" to show the unity of the piece as a whole and bring it to its ringing conclusion, with just an echo of the drum cadence in the very end to let us remember where we started.  The fact that the music HAS an ending (and can't simply be \\"faded out,\\" as with most pop songs) is an indication of its careful construction and is refreshing in an era of sound bites and abbreviated bits and pieces of music being tossed here and there. <br /> <br />All this being said, I have a feeling that this piece may stand with the \\"greats\\" of a bygone era of classic rock.  It has the same bombastic, over-the-top, perfected structure exhibited by the Holy Three from the 70's, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" and \\"Hotel California.\\"  I am excited by this song, and feel hopeful both for this band and for the music of the pop world as well.  Wonderful stuff.  I'm buying the album soon, so maybe another review will be coming.....Until then, enjoy this moment in music history.
0783225903|5.0|Brazil presaged the War on Terror 20 years before it happened. Watching it now brings on a terrible feeling that the future will always look like this with an omnipresent government controlling its people. In the restuarant scene (where the people keep on eating even though the place has been subjected to a terrorist attack) is Baghdad today and perhaps your town tommorrow.   <br />It's the real 1984 - watch it and learn.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I found that I liked everything about this film; the plot/story line, the acting, the musical score, the whole package. <br /> <br />The story of a young East German boy, reared by an unbalanced mother, seduced by a handsome African American soldier, and the victim of a botched sex change operation, is compelling and certainly confronts the issue of how we deal with adversity and reach some sense of inner peace with all those that have transgressed against us and with those whom we have transgressed upon.  The sly manner in which Platonic philosophy is weaved into the story was great. Plato's theories of gender differentiation is integrated into a rock song with cartoons!  Hedwig was dealt a bad hand, over and over, from his/her abandonment in a Midwest trailer park by her African American Sugar Daddy to the theft of her music by a young rocker for whom she once baby-sat. Yet it is reconciliation with the movement of life's ups and downs that is the real point of the story. Hedwig has been abandoned so many times that his/her radar is out for any disloyalty in her band - an obsession that eventually drives them away for a while. Yet, once Hedwig is told by Tommy Gnosis, the young rock star, that he acknowledges (sings) her major contribution to his success, she is able to allow her lead guitarist to move into the spotlight of a transgender rock star. <br /> <br />The acting in this film is super but John Cameron Mitchell is totally over the top. His acting is superb by any measure. His comedic timing is fantastic - delivering wonderful lines with just the right amount of sarcasm and nihilism. Tommy asks: Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior? to which Hedwig calmly states: No but I love his work.  Mitchell's musical performances were as high powered as the dramatic acting. A rock musical is not the easiest idiom to control and master, yet Mitchell excelled. <br /> <br />Stephen Trask's musical score was exceptional. Like an opera, the score must fluctuate between the grand and the intimate, which is exactly what the score from this DVD offers. <br /> <br />I was impressed by the whole dramatic musical package presented here. It is highly entertaining and strongly recommended.
B00005JOLI|1.0|A fine mess indeed. <br /> <br />First, I would like everyone who reads this review to note I am a very obsessed fan of the trilogy. I have read Eragon and Eldest 7 times, and I still love them. They are amazing books. <br /> <br />Second, yes, I am aware what a ripoff these books are from others. Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, even Narnia. I do wish C.P. had listed these as his inspirations, and admitted that this was basically just a modern version of these with a twist, but he chose not to. Well, his loss, I suppose. <br /> <br />Now, onto the movie. <br /> <br />I cannot even begin to describe what a disappointment this movie is. Amazon could add a negative 2,000 star rating and I would still not be able to describe it. This movie had a budget of $100,000,000. That is $6,000,000 more than the budget of \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\". Eragon is a horrible disgrace to the books, while TFOTR is an AMAZING adaptation of the book. <br /> <br />My #1 issue with this movie is the differences. I am aware that movies are always different, but they never do what this movie did. There are OVER 100 DIFFERENCES between this. They aren't just differences though, they are extremely important differences, such as the missing role of Orik, the missing horns of Urgals, the death of the Razac, the missing death of Brom, the magical transformation of Saphira, the change in Durza, Solembums missing role, Murtaghs lack of scar, Eragon never receiving his scar (the worst of all, as this makes the whole plot of the first half of the next movie mean NOTHING at all), 4 cities never appearing, Isidar Mithrim never even appearing (and Saphira never crashing through it), Saphira breathing fire all throughout the movie, The Twins never appearing (this makes Roran fighting them impossible), Hrothgar being human, Dwarves being the size of men, Arya admitting she is an Elven princess (yet again ruining a large part of book 2), Eragon never see's Durza's past, nor does he have a vision of Oromis (the 'fatal blow' to the second book), and last but not least, the change in Brom's appearence. <br /> <br />Has your jaw hit the floor yet? <br /> <br />Now, since I am so critical, ill be fair and suggest some changes. <br /> <br />First, get rid of the current director. Hire a new one in his place, because this one has got to go. Second, release a public apology for this disgrace, and instead of filming the second book, re-film this one. If Fox can't do that, I understand. Instead, they could film the second and third books, then re-film this book. But whatever happens, CHANGE IS NEEDED. <br /> <br />Thank you for reading my review, and let us all hope that this movie will be forgotten in the next.
B000J103OI|1.0|This movie shows a young woman's struggle to keep a seemingly great job...but to \\"get aheasd\\".  That's all there is to it...it's done poorly and my description is as interesting as this movie gets.  Even if you rent this movie you'll be bored...I surely wouldn't buy it again.

B00005JOLI|5.0|What a magnificant film this is!  The photography and landscapes are spectacular and worth seeing alone; being filmed in Hungry and Vancouver, Canada.  And the dragon, an animation, works seamlessly as woven into the reality of the incredible scenery.  (I read in some one else's review that they didn't like this film because it didn't follow the book very well.  As someone who never read the book, I can honestly say that for me, the story line was perfect; beginning with the villan played by John Macklovich through each logical scene that followed.)  It was a gripping story which held my interest throughout as the magic evolved and the touching relationship between dragon and rider grew closer, facilitated by veteran actor Jeramy Irons.  Almost at once I was back in touch with my own adolescence and the adventure of this seventeen year old boy-hero became me, and provided a throughly enjoyable and beautifully filmed vicarious adventure.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|I left this message as a comment to someone else. I decided this should be more visible to everyone. I am currently dealing with the issues this company caused me with my bank. PLEASE READ AND BE FOREWARNED! <br /> <br />I ordered this product and was very angry at the way they handled the order to begin with. The order was taken over the phone by a recording. AFTER they take the order for the sweeper, and your credit card information, they then begin to list the other things you should purchase for the sweeper. I kept pressing #2 to say NO, because once I saw that my order was going to go from about 40.00 + shipping up to well over 100.00 I wanted to change my mind about the entire order. THEY DID NOT GIVE ME THAT OPTION! <br />They simply said \\"thank you for your order\\" and then the line went dead! <br />I found thier customer service number online and called them to cancel and let them know how I felt about the way the order was handled. <br />They said they cancelled my order but did not give me a confirmation number on their own, so I asked for one! Before hanging up the customer service rep. assured me that my order had been cancelled. This was on November 30, 2006. <br />Today December 16, 2006; I received an email from them that said .. my order is on its way! <br />I called my bank to find my account is overdrawn and I have an overdraft charge! <br />I then called the ontel company to complain and have them call my bank and take care of this problem at their expense, only to find that they are not doing business on saturday.  <br />I can not contact anyone until Monday, and I have to go to the bank and cover the insufficient funds for their product and shipping, plus pay 35.00 in fees to my bank. <br />I am furious.  <br />Before anyone decides to do business with these people, this is how they operate. <br />If you respond to the infomercial phone number, you will be greeted by, and your order will be taken by recording. At no time will you have an opportunity to speak with a human being.  <br />At no time will you be given the option to \\"press this number to complete the order\\" or \\"press this number to cancel\\" <br />They will take your order for the sweeper and then collect all the necessary billing/credit card information. <br />After they have this information secured, they will begin to let you know about the parts that will need to be replaced on the sweeper. You will have to replace the \\"plates\\" on the sweeper. ( I do not know what these are yet since THEIR FORCED ORDER has not arrived yet) <br />They will recommend you order their batteries, and there was at least one other thing and I apologize that I can not recall what that was.  <br />My initial order was for one swivel sweeper and \\"get another one free\\" with separate shipping charges for each one. My order was 60.91 total.  <br />Had I continued to order the pieces that would need replacing, my final costs would have been substantially higher. <br />Once you order the sweeper and give them your information, thats all she wrote. You can select NO for the additional pieces, but you CAN NOT cancel your order for the sweeper.  <br />They will simply thank you for the order and end the call for you. And about that \\"confirmation number\\" that I requested when I cancelled my order .. When I received my email today that my sweeper is on its way! The cancellation number they gave me is actually THE ORDER NUMBER!! <br />Lousy business practices! I will never work with this company again and have warned everyone I am in regular contact with about the way they handled this. If people want to stay in business they should think about think ahead about the CUSTOMER rather than their pockets. Not enough can be said for good customer service, and this company does NOT have that! <br />Shameful.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|In my opinion this album has a mix of the most accomplished and the weakest songs incubus have put out. The melodies in the cut back tracks surpass anything Incubus have put out, with Paper Shoes, Dig, Oil and Water, Diamonds and Coal and Pendulous Threads offering a sophistication in songwriting that stands out from any music I have heard in a long time. Why people label cut back rock as simply catering to the mainstream and selling out I don't know. These songs take the most talent to write. <br />What ruins the experience for me are the weak faster tracks that interupt the gorgeous flow this album could have had. Light Grenades sounds like it could have been written by a teenage pop punk band and is the worst track on the album, offering nothing but a quick bash that it seems they felt they should put on the album. Bad move. It's written terribly. Anna Molly is a strange choice of first single. It has quite possibly the worst chorus ever written by Brandon. <br />Earth to Bella sounds unfinished.  <br />However the quality of the other songs make up for the dud tracks. They offer a magic I rarely hear from other bands and my own incubus \\"best of\\" would include alot of tracks from this album.  You have to give Incubus credit for lasting all these years and putting out pretty darn good music overall, consistently. Overall I love the way Incubus have cut back a lot and matured. I don't think they'd be around if they had let themselves date. <br /> <br />And to those who can't accept the change in style over time, perhaps you need to be more open minded musically, or go listen to some dated nu metal  albums. I hope Incubus focus more on their cut back style for the next album, because that is where they shine.
B000065BPB|2.0|These headphones are pretty good. Sound is good, very good for the price, with bass being a little underpowered. Sound isolation is ok, but bass rips through. My biggest gripe is that the headband WILL collapse on you. I've heard it many times, headband breaking. It's true. Give it time and it will break.
B00005JPGO|3.0|Leonardo DiCaprio, our best living actor, leads the charge in this strong, but flawed, offering from Edward Zwick. Pumping out his second Oscar worthy performance this season DiCaprio tries to turn a $100 million monstrosity from Warner Brothers into a political screed. It doesn't really work out that way as the blade on their political knife is so dull that it is rendered nearly useless. Instead we are left with great storytelling that will entertain its intended middle brow audience so much that they won't even remember the message by the time they leave the theater. Manohla Dargis made the clever point that DiCaprio's heartthrob status will get younger females, or the people that need to see this movie the most, into the theater. But you know what they say about leading a horse to water. Playing opposite DiCaprio we have the outmatched Jennifer Connelly who tried to get the native look down, it appears, by falling asleep in a tanning booth. Of course the two attractive white people find each other, amongst a sea of black, to discuss the Clinton scandal. The point is right on, however, as the American people are called out for their sick obsession over that while people in Sierra Leone are dying to feed their vanity. Soon Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) enters the fray as a man who knows the location of a very valuable pink diamond, and the hunt is on. Danny (DiCaprio) is after that diamond in the name of his billfold, Solomon is out to reunite his family who has been divided by the conflict, and Maddy is after the story that will expose the fictional diamond company for doing business with mercenaries. They stomp through the jungle, avoiding pickup trucks filled with machine gun wielding revolutionaries, moving ever so quickly toward the predictable ending.<br /><br />At one point Maddy is asked if the bloodshed would stop if the information she is hunting for is ever found and presented to the American people and she replies, quite frankly, that it probably would not. That's us Americans, steadfastly believing that a few limbs is a small price to pay to make a rich princess feel a little bit more beautiful. Maddy comes off as idealistic next to the hardened Danny, but she has that luxury, and so do we. Danny needs that diamond to get away from the terrible life he has been leading, we don't NEED it for anything and thus have the luxury of not buying it.<br /><br />Throughout the film I was thoroughly entertained. The ending is exactly what you might expect, but the path there is not. Solomon's love for his son becomes a major liability that complicates things on more than one occasion. Zwick does overdo the trick where a giant distraction (usually from the sky) saves the characters in the nick of time. He also uses cheap shots like the constant image of young kids holding big guns. But the reason behind it is pure and you can't expect a housewife to give up her love of diamonds AND children in one night. So despite its problems I am recommending this film, as an act of bravery on Warner Brothers part, as an act of genius on DiCaprio's part, and as an act of great storytelling on Zwick's part. ***1/2ld not.

B00065MDS6|5.0|King Crimson's third album Lizard is not quite as consistant as the first two but it's better than the next one. This is a very jazzy sounding album with some celtic and baroque thrown in. The first part of this release is made up of four songs all sung by Gordon Haskell. In fact, this started up with the lineup that finished Poseidon for the most part anyway. While all these songs are great for me it's the second half of the cd that is like nothing else. Back in the days of records this was one of my most played sides. The Lizard side as we all used to call it back then. It starts off very quitely with a guest vocal appearace by Jon Anderson and then moves in to some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard. Several related pieces that have an absolutely beautiful sound and are quite unlike anything you'll hear anywhere else. A wonderful piece. Big Top is very brief but fits in well with the Lizard Suite.
B000J103PC|5.0|This could easily be dismissed as another \\"little-fish-in-a-big-pond\\" story, but the wonderful script and fine acting by all sets it high above the rest. Meryl Streep was terrific, though she was allowed to show a soft side a few times, which took away from the \\"bite\\" that may have been implied by the title. (I had a boss like that, but mine was meaner and showed less sensitivity). Streep is not the main character, however, and Anne Hathaway shows command in the central role. There's excellent support from Adrian Grenier, Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt. The shots of New York City (and of Paris) are grand and impressive, and, as one would expect, the costume designs are stunning, though few are original for this film. David Frankel's direction kept things moving at a swift pace, and the DVD extras are entertaining and informative. I enjoyed \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" very much.
0440178002|5.0|Don't pick up this book unless you have time to read it all the way through, because I promise you, you will not be able to put it down.  By the time you have read 100 or so pages you are in 16th century Japan. Prepare for late nights and meals untasted, and it will be very hard to tear yourself away from it to go to work or school. <br /> <br />This title is high adventure with wonderful characters and an almost anthropological discussion of upper class Japanese and Samurai behavior of the time period. <br /> <br />The experts say there are historical inaccuracies, and since I was a history major, normally these would prevent me from singing the praises of a work of historical fiction.  Not in this case though, read it. You'll love it.  And if you want a more factual interpretation of the carrer of Blackthorne, read _Samurai William : the Englishman who opened Japan_ by Giles Milton. <br /> <br />P.S.  You may remember the mini-series made from the book.  As is usual in these cases, the film does not do justice to the book.
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere is the haunting story of a man, unhappy with his life, who suddenly finds himself living a new life. This life is an alternate version of the town he already lives in, yet there is wonderful and deadly magic surrounding him at all times along with creatures who we do not see in the \\"real\\" world. It is this land to which he ultimately escapes to..a land in the sewers and underground of London, but the question is...can he get back to his old life which he once found so boring. <br /> <br />This wonderful novel once again examines a common question posed in Gaiman's other works...if we had the chance to escape a life that we call boring, would we like the alternative or ultimately want our boring lives back and would we find that there really not so boring afterall. <br /> <br />There is also a mini-series available on DVD of Neverwhere, but I have not seen it yet. But I highly, HIGHLY recommend this wonderful book!
B000ION23A|5.0|I loved this movie! I hadn't bothered with it before as the reviews were pretty bad, but it was one of the movie options on a transatlantic flight, so I thought I'd give it a try. Well, shows how much they know! I was impressed! So many movies now are washed-out tripe devoid of real spunk, but this one was spicy! The moral messeges are delivered in a way that seems part-disney, part-brothers grimm. It works perfectly though, it's that sort of mild horror kids dig, like in Monster House. <br />Good stuff!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|When I ran into this CD I was in Borders picking up another CD and I thought I'd listen to this one since it was on display. My jaw dropped and I bought it immediately. The music is modern and poppy but fully orchestrated and broadway! I was infatuated with this when I first bought it. I know almost all the lyrics to every song. I bought and devoured the book (which is even BETTER than the musical), I went to NY and saw it on broadway (and it is as visually amazing as it is Book and Music wise.) Basicly Wicked took over my life for a couple of months. I think young and old will like this alike. It is one of the greatest 21st century musicals hands down. I would suggest this to EVERYONE. Favorite Song: \\"No Good Deed Goes Unpunished\\"
B00005J6RE|3.0|If you are deciding which volumes to keep, this one only just falls under the \\"nice to have but dispensable\\" category which is a pity because the first episode, \\"The Ultimate Computer\\" is actually one of the best episodes from the second season and comes after a string of mediocre episodes.  We get a very interesting premise: \\"Will computers/technology ever make humans redundant?  This similar premise has been visited many times over since in movies like \\"Terminator\\", \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"I, Robot\\" and will probably still strike a chord with viewers many years into the future as well.  The acting is very good and coupled with one of the better scripts ever written for Trek make this a very memorable episode indeed.<br /><br />Now for the downside: \\"The Omega Glory\\" is a ridiculous episode which unlike the very similar episodes \\"Piece of the Action\\" and \\"Patterns of Force\\" in which the virtually identical parallels with Earth history were explained by Prime Directive violations, we are expected to believe that inexplicably, some planet light years away developed the Declaration of Independence word-for-word and have exactly the same flag as the U.S.  The two warring factions are also called the Yanks and the Communists!  The ridiculous plot and average acting makes this among the 3 worst ever episodes in the entire Trekdom.<br /><br />I see that Amazon is now offering downloads of individual episodes for about $2 each.  It's probably a good way to get around this conundrum and perhaps order the one episode and forget the other one as quickly as possible!
B00003CXZ4|3.0|I understand the story.  There were so many evil people in this movie and everyone looks terrible.  I am a big fan of Guy Pierce and his first movie, Priscilla Queen of the Desert is still my favorite performance of his so I was very happy that he was finally recognized with Memento (although it seems to have been his version of kd lang's Constant Craving where the public recognized at long last your talent and then ignores you.) <br /> <br />My reaction to this movie was \\"So what?\\"
1565847032|1.0|Understanding Power is, without question, the most comprehensive and compelling presentation of Noam Chomsky's ideas.  Reading this book will change the way you see the world.  If you are interested in Chomsky, it is likely that you are a noble person who genuinely cares for others and yearns for a better world.  Beware, reader, and make sure you choose the right vehicle for your hope.  While his intentions are for a peaceful, safe, and healthy world, Chomsky's political writings systematically assume conscious malevolence without evidence, ignore context, and romanticize Third World struggles, regardless of their goals.  <br /> <br />Let's briefly examine some of his convictions on a pressing topic: the War on Terror.  Following the September 11th attacks, Chomsky immediately presented them as our fault: the result of U.S. Middle East policy, and equally evil U.S. Cold War efforts (training Mujahadeen to oust the Soviets from Afghanistan).  His presumption here is that if the United States changes its behavior, that terrorist attacks will then cease.  Islamic terrorists, in fact, want a pan-world government under Talibanesque repressive sharia law, a vision that mandates the overthrow of all free nations beginning with ours.  These facts are easily learned by reading about the historical development of Islamic radicalism, which is rooted in reinterpretations of the Qur'an's dictates for action, NOT in wishes to live peacefully in a U.S.-free Middle East.  These facts, however, do not enter into the Chomskyan world-view, which romanticizes Third World underdogs as brave and legitimized no matter what they stand for.   <br /> <br />The linguist also described the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan as a conscious \\"silent genocide,\\" predicting wrongly that millions would be severed from food supplies.  As is typical, Chomsky here focused solely on the negative aspects of the situation, those for which the U.S. deserved his bitter recrimination.  For a man who lives prosperously in America and is supposedly the voice of the downtrodden, Chomsky certainly did not put himself into the shoes of the Afghan women.  For them, whose existence was akin to slavery, the liberation was a cause for great joy.  Actual sentiments were fully antithetical to Chomsky's condemnatory remarks to his villainous U.S. government, which he and he alone believed was consciously bent on killing as many innocent Afghans as possible.  Omitting what is significant (the liberation of people living under tyranny, in this case) to emphasize his often ludicrous misperceptions about American motives and motivations is a constant in Chomsky's writings.  His Cold War depictions are even more stunning, as Understanding Power's abundant examples attest.   <br /> <br />In the case that you are already entrenched in his manner of thinking, at least admit that Noam Chomsky MIGHT be wrong, and see if his positions hold up under review: read Chomsky's articulate, sane critics.  If he is perfect, then you have nothing but gain to acheive from this exercise; it will only serve to strengthen your ability to effectively argue and implement Chomsky's ideas in the world.  After clear-eyed reassessment of his political writings, if you STILL think he's on-point, then all the best to you.  If, however, you reevaluate his \\"wisdom,\\" you will have saved yourself from much needless confusion and despair.   <br /> <br />Were Chomsky's views simply false, there would not be need for this posting.  They become perilous, however, in their blind, wholesale demonization of the United States.  Chomsky's own fear and anger about the state of our world are projected, with great urgency: anger at and fear of U.S. \\"elites\\" is the Chomsky program.  The result is often flat-out hatred.  What would Chomsky do were he President?  We do not know; he avoids that inconvenient question by telling us that were he to run (which he admits he would never do), the first thing he would do is tell us not to votefor him.  Furthermore, why does Professor Chomsky not include himself in the \\"elites\\" so prominent in his analyses?  Does he not pay taxes, and drive a BMW, and teach at a cushy, prestigious university?  The questions may seem too simplistic, but they point to a core issue: if Chomsky cannot look into the mirror regarding his own status and societal position, then how much more impaired must his assessments be of things outside of himself?  On paper, it is unclear exactly what Chomsky IS calling for, and putting aside the constant onslaught of judgment-filled writings and audio programs, neither does his life provide us an example of what he conceives to be right-action.  Those who want an idea of who believes IN Chomsky, however, need look no further than Hugo Chavez, who recently proclaimed allegiance and military support to his \\"brother\\" Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Ahmadinejad, for anyone who needs reminding, daily denies the Holocaust, and calls for the destruction of Israel and the United States.  Is it a coincidence that those who love Chomsky also embrace a world-view rooted in blame, anger, and vilification?   <br /> <br />Good and evil do exist in this world, but Noam Chomsky is not capable of distinguishing between the two.  The U.S.A. is not perfect, and never will be.  Nevertheless, if we fail to recognize the good that IS here, we may soon lose our nation.  Chomsky's writings are little more than a good reminder that appearance is not essence.  It is worth noting as well, that Chomsky is an avowed atheist, and believes that life is meaningless.  If we bear in mind that evil is in the eye of the beholder, then Chomsky--an American, an Israelite, a millionaire--is instantly unmasked in all of his self-revulsion.  Understanding Power should be retitled as \\"Understanding Blame.\\"  Stear clear and take heart, reader; there is hope in this world, and your country is good, but you will discover neither in Avram Noam Chomsky.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|This is Journey in their prime. it doesn't get any better that this.<br /><br />1. Don't Stop Believin'- Probably their best known song. A great rocker.<br /><br />2. Stone in Love - My all-time favorite Journey song. An underrated rock 'n' roll classic.<br /><br />3. Who's Cryin' Now - Neal Schon's bluesy soulful Gibson sings with feeling the whole way through.<br /><br />4. Keep on Runnin' - People don't think of this song when they think of Journey. A loud and fast one, I LOVE IT!!! (Extra points for the XC runner like me)<br /><br />5. Still They Ride - It's alright. Of all their songs that were popular back before I was born, this is one of the weaker ones.<br /><br />6. Escape - A great plethora of musical variety. A good jam, especially live.<br /><br />7. Lay it Down - Simple song, yet still rocks out. Steve Perry shows his aggressive?, testosterone driven? side...<br /><br />8. Dead or Alive - A run of the mill song where Neal Schon's blazing guitar is the only strong point.<br /><br />9. Mother, Father - A moving song written by Schon and his sister? wife?... not sure, but it's a good one.<br /><br />10. Open Arms - The perfect closer to the album. A timeless, if not the best, power ballad.<br /><br />p.s. --- John Cain was the guy who really brought this whole album together to make it as popular as it was. Greg Rolie (the former keyboarder) had more of a jam feel to his songwriting/playing. Cain was the one who made the general public (or at least some of the general public) love Journey.<br /><br />peace out

B000JJRIN4|4.0|<br /> <br /> <br />Maybe I'm drinking the kool-aid or perhaps I am in fact taking crazy pills either one of these could be cause for my immense enjoyment of Gwen Stefani's new album \\"The Sweet Escape\\". Or it could be that I had little to no real expectations beyond a decent pop album from my fave platinum blonde bomb shell....though I ended up with a disc that was not only above average, but far superior to her solo debut.  <br />You see though I liked L.A.M.B. it took it for what it was. A cute pop record from an artitst who either was smart enough (or frankly naïve enough) to write songs for 16 yr old girls. Eitehr way it payed off as the album was a success...and it should have been. It was a fun electro pop/hip hop party record that did everything it should have done....that is to say rock the party.  <br />So that leaves us with the new record. If you listen to the first track only (the hollaback esque \\"Wind it up\\") you might think this album will end up being merely L.A.M.B. part 2 with all the pitfalls that plague yr average Hollywood franchise sequel. This seems to be what most are saying about The Sweet Escape. I would probably agree with this assessment only I chose to continue listening to the album. Having done so I discovered that not only is Gwen's sophomore solo effort superior to her debut its probably one of the more daring pop records I've listened to in a while. This is a thoroughly modern record, unlike the decidedly retro L.A.M.B. On my first listen I remember thinking how weird some of this music was (well for a pop record) but it worked.  I found myself playing the disc repeatedly and yes...singing along. I know I'm a dork, but that fact aside I think the fact that one can sing along is kind of a good thing.  <br />Ok so lets break it down to the pro's and conts. In the pro column I would have to put the fact that this album have wonderfull pop ballads such as \\"Early Winter\\" and the wonderfull \\"4 in the morning\\" Quite honestly these two songs alone are worth the price of admission as they are better than any ballad on the first record for sure and arguably her best solo efforts to date.  One other for the pro  column has to be that this album as a whole dosnt seem to be so blatanly targeted to 16 yr olds...to anyone older than that target demographic this is a good thing.  <br />Now to be fair lets have some cons. As a amateur dj I would have to say that there are few tracks on this record I would feel comfortable dropping at a party. There simply aren't any songs that are as \\"hot\\" as \\"What you waiting for\\" or \\"Hollaback girl\\". To many this means the record is a disappointment....that's just not the case to me. To my way of thinking there exists a time for all music. Party records though fun whilst drinking it up and hitting on the ladies get old in just about any other social (or non social) setting. But if having great but shakeing tunes is a criteria then this album might disappoint (when compared to other artists making wonderfull party records these days)
B00004TJKI|4.0|'Anatomy of a Murder' illustrates vividly how one lawyer repeatedly faces the heat of a controversial rape-case courtroom battle... The film might be Stewart's finest performance... For his magnificent achievement, Stewart was nominated for an Academy Award... The film itself received a total of seven Oscars in various categories, but was overtaken by William Wyler's 'Ben-Hur', the blockbuster of that year, whose star, Charlton Heston, beat out Stewart for best actor...<br /><br />'Anatomy of a Murder' is one of the few great racy courtroom melodramas ever put on the screen... It is a study of characters superbly detailed, in which a simple country lawyer zealously defends a young Army lieutenant charged with clearly gunning down a bar-owner who, he alleges, raped his young wife... The murder takes place some time after Remick tells her husband (Gazzara) she was raped-enough time to suggest that the killing was not done in the heat of passion but with some deliberation...<br /><br />Stewart, a warm bachelor lawyer with an old-fashioned grace of manner, is wonderfully believable as the qualified defense attorney, who tries to establish whether or not Lee Remick has been raped... He masterfully guides his defendant to the most exciting climax, repeatedly drawing forth evidence which he knows to be inadmissible, but which he wants the jury to hear...<br /><br />Stewart smokes cheap cigars, plays jazz piano, and restrains beautifully Remick's flirtatious overtures, but his benevolence is never in question... We see him hauling the provocative Remick from out of the bar telling her to be a good, and submissive housewife for the court...<br /><br />Stewart studies with a cynical eye the peculiar traits of the accused, tolerates, with amused resignation, his friend's drunken lapses, and competently makes his point to the judge and jury...<br /><br />Ben Gazzara proves to be a problematic client, close to uncooperative with his lawyer... Also, it is very clear that he is a jealously possessive man, which is enough to question the validity of the rape charge, he claims that he acted in a moment of insane anger... The film raises fascinating legal highlights on disorders of jealousy...<br /><br />Lee Remick gives a sensational performance as the sexy wife whose missing panties form a vital part of the evidence...<br /><br />Remick knows how to attract and seduce... She is so coquettish that she drives her angry husband to murder... The trial poses tricky questions: Was the Remick character in advanced levels of seduction during her wanderings at the neighborhood bar? Did her bruises come from the man whom she claimed raped her, or from her jealous husband?<br /><br />George C. Scott plays the sly, sardonic prosecuting attorney who offers the character a wonderful air of arrogance and superiority, unnerving with his aggressive antagonism witnesses and defense attorney...<br /><br />Arthur O'Connell rises to the occasion when his lawyer-hero needs him...<br /><br />Eve Arden is Stewart's faithful and efficient secretary eager that the Manion case might bring her a long-overdue paycheck...<br /><br />The courtroom fencing between Stewart and Scott is so convincing with the casting of Joseph N. Welch as the delightful ever-patient judge, Harlan Weaver... Judge Weaver, whose patience is repeatedly tried by the grotesque gestures of the lawyers in the case, appears too kindly to be much of a courtroom disciplinarian... But in the tension between the shrewd old judge and the lawyer for defense, the film raises a crucial issue on the rules of advocacy: To what extent a lawyer should represent a client zealously within the rules and norms of courtroom etiquette?<br /><br />Preminger's penchant for long takes and a mobile camera, rather than cuts and conversational reaction shots, here serves both to illuminate the crucial ambiguities in the characters, and to facilitate an objective appraisal of the mechanics of the legal process...<br /><br />Preminger challenges the American censors over the candid sexual terminology and explicit examination of rape in his courtroom drama... Ellington's score brilliantly captures the tension and the moral ambiguity that characterize the movie... Sam Leavitt's black-and-white photography is particularly impressive, setting as it does the stark mood of the authentic Michigan locations...legal process...  <br /> <br />Preminger challenges the American censors over the candid sexual terminology and explicit examination of rape in his courtroom drama...

0385336691|5.0|I've been a \\"Jack Reacher\\" fan since the beginning.  Though there have been a few novels in the series that didn't quite measure up to the first one, The Killing Floor, most of them have come pretty close to being equal in style, cope, and pure entertainment fun.  The Hard Way, however, surpasses the nine previous books and proves that Lee Child is definitely getting better and better with each fabulous novel.<br /><br />In this one, Jack Reacher is in the wrong place at the wrong time and inadvertently gets drawn into the kidnapping of Edward Lane's wife and stepdaughter.  Lane (ex-Delta Force) is now the head of a small corporation in New York City that supplies mercenaries to foreign governments around the world.  The men who work for Lane are ex-Army Special Forces, ex-Marine Recon, ex-Navy Seals, and ex-British SAS, but only Reacher has the necessary investigative skills to track down the kidnappers.  Lane quickly enlist the services of Reacher, while at the same time warning him not to screw up, or else risk the consequences.  It seems that several years earlier, Lane's first wife was kidnapped and then murdered due to a mistake by the FBI.  Lane wants to make sure that doesn't happen again, and he's prepared to do whatever it takes to get his family back.  The one major problem is that everything is not as it seems; and, before long, Jack Reacher won't know whom to trust.  The only thing for sure of is that it's up to him to bring this woman and her child back to safety, even if he has to kill everyone who gets in his way.  The men of Special Opts may think they're tough, but they haven't tangled with Reacher yet, and when they do, a lot of body bags are going to be needed.<br /><br />Lee Child has written his most complex novel to date.  Not only must Reacher save the kidnapped woman and her eight-year-old child, he has to figure out what happened with Edward Lane's first wife and if there's a connection.  He'll have to filter through the lies to find the truth, connecting the dots from a brutally murdered woman in New Jersey, to a man that suffered unbelievable atrocities while being held prisoner in Africa, and to a small farm in England where an eventual showdown will take place and a lot of people will die before the sun comes up.  This is Lee Child at his very best, capturing the reader's attention in the first few pages and then holding it in a vise-like grip until the end.  Few writers are able to deliver the goods like Lee Child's does, and The Hard Way delivers in full force, leaving the reader exhausted from the roller-coaster ride of excitement and edge-of-your-seat suspense.  Taut with twist and turns that will keep you constantly guessing, this is the book to read to escape another boring weekend.  The author now faces the difficult challenge of surpassing The Hard Way, which would even cause Jack Reacher to shake his head in surrender.the truth, connecting the dots from a brutally murdered woman in New Jersey, to a man that suffered unbelievable atrocities while being held prisoner in Africa, and to a small farm in England where an eventual showdown will take place and a lot of people will die before the sun comes up.

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins, the genius who brought us memes, and perhaps one of the greatest thinkers of our time, is at his prime in \\"The God Delusion.\\" Though Dawkins' may put off some people with his bold, harsh critique of religion, I admire his courage to speak out--I can't think of a more qualified, or dignified person to be the spokesperson for all atheists. His devotion to science is unwavering, and my admiration for him remains unbounded. He has made significant contributions--not only in science--but also for society as a whole. Richard Dawkins is perhaps the greatest biologist of all time.    \\"The God Delusion\\" is a brash title, but it's attention-getting. More and more people will take notice. The title itself will plant seeds of doubt in the minds of those who are religious. And where there is doubt, there is freedom. That is the beauty of free speech--when someone boldly questions the very foundations of our basic principles, and makes us think, is an essential component for critical thinking.     As an American, I'm alarmed at how religious our country has become. We live in a society where more Americans would rather vote for a homosexual president than an atheist one. And for an industrialized, secular society, we fall far behind our European and Asian counterparts in science and technology. How can we graduate more scientists if our students genuinely believe that creationism is a \\"science\\"? We are literally the laughingstock of the industrialized world.    Though I will not go into the details of Dawkins' book, I will say that \\"The God Delusion\\" should be required reading for everyone--it is truly a can-opener for closed minds. Not only does Dawkins criticize the Pope, he shows no mercy for Mother Teresa, Islamic fundamentalists, evangelicals, or even the Amish. A great many topics are discussed in this book--from abortion and morality, to homosexuality and the founding principles of our once great nation. Dawkins is sending out the message that yes, it IS okay to question religious authority--why should they be exempt from scrutiny?     Dawkins' tone is articulate, conversational, easy-going, charming. A notable chapter is WHY THERE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY NO GOD, in which he successfully refutes creationist arguments for intelligent design, and further clarifies the meaning of natural selection and why it works so well.     Dawkins, you are a wonderful man, and I thank you for writing this wonderful book!     Long live Dawkins! Long live Darwin!    -E. Del Real

We do not know; he avoids that inconvenient question by telling us that were he to run (which he admits he would never do), the first thing he would do is tell us not to vote for him.  Furthermore, why does Professor Chomsky not include himself in the \\"elites\\" so prominent in his analyses?  Does he not pay taxes, and drive a BMW, and teach at a cushy, prestigious university?  The questions may seem too simplistic, but they point to a core issue: if Chomsky cannot look into the mirror regarding his own status and societal position, then how much more impaired must his assessments be of things outside of himself?  On paper, it is unclear exactly what Chomsky IS calling for, and putting aside the constant onslaught of judgment-filled writings and audio programs, neither does his life provide us an example of what he conceives to be right-action.  Those who want an idea of who believes IN Chomsky, however, need look no further than Hugo Chavez, who recently proclaimed allegiance and military support to his \\"brother\\" Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Ahmadinejad, for anyone who needs reminding, daily denies the Holocaust, and calls for the destruction of Israel and the United States.  Is it a coincidence that those who love Chomsky also embrace a world-view rooted in blame, anger, and vilification?   <br /> <br />Good and evil do exist in this world, but Noam Chomsky is not capable of distinguishing between the two.  The U.S.A. is not perfect, and never will be.  Nevertheless, if we fail to recognize the good that IS here, we may soon lose our nation.  Chomsky's writings are little more than a good reminder that appearance is not essence.  It is worth noting as well, that Chomsky is an avowed atheist, and believes that life is meaningless.  If we bear in mind that evil is in the eye of the beholder, then Chomsky--an American, an Israelite, a millionaire--is instantly unmasked in all of his self-revulsion.  Understanding Power should be retitled as \\"Understanding Blame.\\"  Stear clear and take heart, reader; there is hope in this world, and your country is good, but you will discover neither in Avram Noam Chomsky.   <br />
0689865384|5.0|I really loved this book--and the whole series.  In addition to the creative story and well-developed plot, what I particularly loved was the characterization of Tally.  She's intelligent, strong, independent yet full of faults.  I appreciate a female character that has nothing to do with being female.  She's a wonderfully real character--unfortunately still somewhat unique in the world of sci fi.  I can't wait to read other Westerfeld books.
B00003CX95|5.0|Set in the late 13th century, 'Braveheart' is the story of one of Scotland's greatest national heroes Sir William Wallace. leader of the Scottish resistance forces during the first years of the long, ultimately successful struggle to free Scotland from English rule...<br /><br />Crucially charismatic in the title role, Gibson plays the heroic figure and emerges as a remarkable hero with wit and romantic soul, determined to rid his country of its English oppressors...<br /><br />Wallace's revolution was set in motion, with great obstacles from his countrymen... Many Scottish nobles lent him only grudging support as most of them were more concerned with wealth and titles than the freedom of the country... In fact, the Scottish leaders are in favor of revolt-or not-depending on English bribes... Wallace, by comparison, is a man of honor, incorruptible and righteous... He was knighted and proclaimed 'guardian and high protector of Scotland,' but as much as he railed against the Scottish nobles, submitted to Edward I, King of England, he was astonished and in shock to discover the treachery of the leading Scot contender for the throne--Robert, the Earl of Bruce--to whom he confided , 'The people would follow you, if you would only lead them.' Sophie Marceau is exquisite as the distressed princess Isabella of France who ends up falling in love with Wallace, warning him out of several traps...<br /><br />Catherine McCormack is a stunning beauty who ignites Wallace's revolution...<br /><br />Patrick McGoohan is chilling, brutal, and vicious as the ruthless Edward I, known by the nickname 'Longshanks.' This king remains simply the embodiment of evil...<br /><br />While Angus McFadyen moves as a nobleman torn between his conscience and political aspiration, and Brendan Gleeson brings strength and humor to his role as the robust Hamish, David O'Hara is very effective as the crazy Irishman who provides much of the film's comic relief from even the most tensed moments...<br /><br />Mel Gibson has reason to be proud of 'Braveheart.' It is a motion picture that dares to be excessive... Gibson presents passionately the most spaciously impressive battles (yet staged for films) even excessively, and it is his passion and excess that make the motion picture great... The horror and futility of massed hand-to-hand combats are exciting rather repulsive... It is epic film-making at its glorious best...<br /><br />Gibson's 'Braveheart' focuses on the human side of Wallace, a character so immense, so intelligent, and so passionate, exploring the definitions of honor and nobility, pushing us to follow the hero into his struggle against injustice and oppression...<br /><br />There is a great shot of the lovely mountains of Scotland covered in mist with beautiful bagpipe music... James Horner's beautiful score, calls up memories of his work for 'Titanic.'.. <br /> <br />Mel Gibson has reason to be proud of 'Braveheart.' It is a motion picture that dares to be excessive...

0553579908|4.0|It's a terribly long buildup to the clash that occurs at the end of this 1,000-page tome. I didn't find it as compelling as A Game of Thrones (Book 1)--which I thoroughly enjoyed--but I still admire Martin's ability to juggle many different plot lines. Martin also excels at creating fully realized characters, not mere caricatures that service the plot. His characters sometimes behave unpredictably, and they possess weaknesses as well as strengths. One criticism: Martin has an annoying habit of killing major characters off-scene. Although the book held my attention, I'm beginning to lose my patience (particularly with the plot line involving Daenerys Targaryen, the daughter of the Dragon-blood king, who spends the entire novel peripheral to story as she raises her three dragons). When are those freaking dragons going to figure into the story? Do I have to read another 3,000 pages? Presumably Book 3 will tie more of the plot lines together. If not, I'll be disappointed and will begin to wonder if Martin isn't guilty of the same crime as Robert Jordan: milking this fat cow of a series for far too long.

1594200823|4.0|This book is an in-depth exploration of the American diet and systems of food production.  Pollan considers 4 types of food production, \\"industrial\\", \\"industrial organic\\", organic, and home-grown/gathered.  For each type of production, he follows a group of foods from farms to processing, and ultimately, consumption at a meal. Along the way, he discusses related topics from economic and philosophical aspects of farming, to the ethics of eating or using animals, to sustainable farming practices.  For further reading, Pollan provides a partially annotated chapter-by-chapter bibliography at the end of the book.<br /><br />In the section on industrial agriculture, Pollan argues that the diet of Americans is based more on corn than most of us realize.  Not that we eat much corn meal, corn on the cob, or corn flakes, but our processed foods are filled with corn products and by-products, our sodas get their calories almost exclusively from corn sweeteners, and our meat is raised mainly on corn.  As Pollan describes it, this is made possible because American corn is so cheap, and it's so cheap because it's heavily subsidized by the government. Industrial farms grow corn using huge inputs of petroleum-based fertilizers, and the huge harvests have allowed the growth of industrial feedlots, where animals are treated like machines for converting corn to meat.  Pollan concedes that this had made food cheaper for modern American consumers than ever before, but it hasn't made us any healthier, it's not sustainable for the future, and the farmers are barely getting by, despite their impressive productivity.  In the next part of the book, about industrial organic producers, Pollan argues that the situation is only slightly better for large-scale organic production.  He describes how many large-scale industrial organic growers are jumping through the hoops, completing the required paperwork to be certified as organic, but the final product is only marginally better than that of the regular industrial producers.<br /><br />In the third section, Pollan meets and works with a truly remarkable farmer, Joel Salatin.  Salatin, owner of Polyface Farm in Swoope Virginia, is the author of several books on farming practices.  Salatin can't be bothered to be certified organic.  Instead, he spends his mental energy figuring out how the ecological systems operate on his farms, and how to maximize the output of his farm with minimal outside input besides sunshine.  His yearly production figures for eggs, broilers, beef, pork, and turkey are impressive, and yet he manages to achieve these figures without fertilizers or feed lots, and his amount of topsoil has increased over the years.  He charges higher prices for his products than a chain grocery store would, but as Salatin says, \\"You get what you pay for. Why is it that we exempt food, of all things from that rule?...Don't you find it odd that people will put more work into choosing their mechanic or house contractor than they will into choosing the person who grows their food.?\\"<br /><br />Despite the lessons Pollan learned about the value of foods from small producers while working on Salatin's farm, he still seems to be missing the most important concept of all:  If you want to eat locally or seasonally, you begin your menu or plan your diet not by dreaming of what you want to eat, and then trying to see how you can provide it, but by starting with what is freshest and abundant right now, and creating from there.  Pollan laments that when planning his local meal in Swoope, since it was June, Polyface had no fresh beef, pork or turkey, so he'd have to serve chicken. Instead of taking this perspective, to plan a truly local meal, Pollan should have started from the assumption that since it was June and he wanted to serve fresh foods, he would be serving chicken, squirrel, or vegetarian, period.  He had the same problem later on when planning his meal based on foods that he hunted, gathered, or grew himself.  Once again, he dreamed up a wondrous menu in advance that featured an abalone appetizer, fresh wild mushrooms, and wild boar.  But when he finally shot his boar and it was ready for the kitchen, the abalone wouldn't cooperate in getting caught in sufficient numbers, and he had to serve dried rather than fresh mushrooms.  Pollan notes \\"Perhaps the hardest rule to obey was the one about seasonality and freshness. I would venture that the daily menus of real hunter-gatherers were limited to loads of whatever happens to be plentiful that day and very little of anything else.\\"  Duh!  That's why agriculture was invented, because it provides a more reliable food source than depending on what you happen across in the forest.  Not only were the daily menus of hunter-gatherers limited to loads of whatever happened to be plentiful, but there were many days when they were limited to nothing at all. Agriculture makes a great hedge against such days, as well as providing the variety that we have come to value.  But omnipresent abundance in supermarkets has made us forget the reality of the seasonality of agriculture, which has led us to believe that we can plan to eat any food at all any time of year.  If one stops depending on supermarket foods, the need to make seasonality the primary determiner of menus becomes second nature.<br /><br />Pollan comments on the immense pleasure he experienced when serving food that he knew intimately, that he had grown, gathered, or shot with his own hands. This is a lesson that Henry David Thoreau frequently commented on in his journals, noting that the main sweet of fruit is found in the gathering itself, not in the eating, so one who merely purchases blueberries instead of going blueberrying in the forest is denied the true pleasure of the fruit. The more one grows and gathers food for oneself, the less tempting any other food becomes, and the less conceivable it becomes to purchase any foods at all from industrial agriculture systems, either regular or organic.himself.

B000JJRIN4|2.0|\\"The Sweet Escape\\", Gwen Stefani's sophomore album, is a big disappointment. With all the negativity surrounding this album before and after its release, I wasn't too surprised about this album's lacklustre quality, but I literally sat down and struggled to this album's dozen tracks, waiting in vain for at least one track that'd really, really, REALLY blow me away! Sadly, such a moment never came. <br /> <br />Seriously, you'd think a woman of Gwen Stefani's talent and experience would know how to craft a stronger album than \\"The Sweet Escape\\". She's been in the music industry for over 20 years, she's the leader of a successful new wave/ ska / rock band (No Doubt), she's worked with artists and producers from almost every colour of the musical spectrum and she has a strong, beautiful voice that possesses more than enough vocal and emotional range. Unfortunately, she restricts her vocal gifts to the album's 2 main solid standouts - the emotional ballads \\"Early Winter\\" & \\"4 In The Morning\\". To make things more shocking, the only other three bearable tracks on \\"The Sweet Escape\\" is the autobiographical \\"Orange County Girl\\" (try your best to ignore the ridiculously stupid, IQ-lacking chorus), \\"Wonderful Life\\", a dreamy Pop ballad that was left over from her debut album \\"Love, Angel, Music, Baby\\", and the title track, where Akon -I repeat, AKON!- massively helps Gwen enliven the track with high-pitched background yelps, horns, a guitar loop and a tambourine. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, everything else left on this album proves that creativity isn't always the way to go. Ok, maybe \\"Yummy\\", a Neptune-produced/Pharrell Williams-featuring Hip-Hop / Pop / \\"disco tetris\\" club ditty, would be an exception to the previous line because, despite the track's abundance of hooks and catchy lyrics, it's nothing more than a second-rate rewrite of her 2005 hit \\"Hollaback Girl\\" or Kelis' 2003 hit \\"Milkshake\\". Speaking of The Neptunes, they are the reigning producers of this 12-track-longmonstrosity, providing not only the unoriginal \\"Yummy\\", but the indescribably awful lead single \\"Wind It Up\\", which melds a sample of \\"The Lonely Goatherd\\" from \\"The Sound Of Music\\" with Gwen Stefani's annoying rap, pitiful lyrics and another second-rate beat. The Neptunes are also the creators of \\"Breakin' Up\\", which converts a faltering-cell-phone-is-like-a-faltering-relationship metaphor into more painful musical trash. As for the rest of the producers -Swizz Beatz and others- they shouldn't be surprised if their credibility is shot down for the terrible contributions they made to this CD. Ex-band-mate Tony Kanal, despite helping in the creation of the horrid \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\", redeems himself with the previously mentioned \\"4 In The Morning\\". <br /> <br />Despite the disappointing production most of the producers provide, Gwen Stefani is far more responsible for this album's many flaws. She deliberately holds back her powerful vocals in favour of sh**ty rapping that possesses neither the attitude nor the style that gave Gwen Stefani her personality and originality. Her debut album \\"L.A.M.B.\\", as flawed as it was, at least had a lot more effort put into it - there was consistency, ambition, clear standouts, a certain degree of creativity and a genuine desire for re-invention, many of which she achieved alongside the album's more experienced and more inspired producers and collaborators. Unfortunately, \\"The Sweet Escape\\" merely inherits a lot more of its predecessor's faults -superficiality, materialism, lack of humanity or emotional warmth,- than its strengths. If this album isn't the sound of a woman desperately pleading for the mainstream audience's cash, it's a signal that direly screams for the re-union of No Doubt and the sound of a woman stuck in a creative rut. You'd think getting married, having a child and working with new collaborators would result in the creation of something more inspired, but I guess not. 2 stars! <br /> <br />5 Best Tracks: <br/>\\"Early Winter\\" <br />\\"4 In The Morning\\" <br />\\"Wonderful Life\\" <br />\\"The Sweet Escape (feat. Akon)\\" <br />\\"Orange County Girl\\" <br />

B00005JOLI|1.0|Ugh.  In all my years of watching fantasy films and studying mythological creatures, I have NEVER been so disappointed.<br /><br />I have never read the books on which the movie is based, but I was wooed to the theatre by the exciting and visually interesting trailer.  That preview absolutely packed every last beautiful image and every interesting line of dialogue that the movie contained into 60 seconds.  Sadness and despair.<br /><br />A complete and shameful waste of the talented and rugged-sexy Jeremy Irons, the incredibly sinister and somewhat type-cast John Malcovich, and the beautiful vocal stylings fo Rachel Weiss.  I weep for their embarassment at having to show this piece of cliched crap to their families and friends.<br /><br />The only interesting thing about the film was the back-story about the dragon riders and how the evil king (Malcovich) slayed them all, except the one, despondent and bitter Irons,(we never learn the King's motivation for this, other than I suppose his pure evilness) and how a dragon dies if its rider is killed.  That might have been a film worth watching.<br /><br />As it stands, the screen-play is hideously loaded with stock b.s. and the dialogue is so bad it actually made me laugh, which I don't think was the desired effect.  At one point, the hero Eragon, freshly outfitted in his specially made (overnight!) armor, looks into a warped piece of metal and at his fun-house reflection actually says aloud \\"I hardly recognize myself.\\"  Gee, I guess so, you dolt, you look like a molten hunk of shiny bad writing.<br /><br />This stero-typical young handsome boy is called to be a hero of stero-typical proportions, of course denying his \\"chosen\\"-ness and mysteriously bestowed magical powers, until he is wooed by the cliched beautiful elf princess, backed up by the mandatory wise mentor, and a \\"shady\\" side-kick of dubious blood relation to the evil guy (I never did figure which one, the king or his cliched evil sorceror) to fight the ugly and sinister minions of the terrible evil King.  I cannot tell you anything more.  That is all there is. Every terrrible stock-character and every over-used plot device EVER used.<br /><br />On an up-note, the CGI was lovely, and I do want a pet dragon of my very own if she is as lovely and kind and pet-able as Saphira.  On the other hand, it is hard to believe a dragon is a fierce warrior when she speaks telepathically to our hero with the angellic voice of Weiss.  Although, amazingly, that is the only character I had any sense of connection or sympathy toward.  That says something about the two dimensionality of every other character that the one who is actually two dimensional is the only one worth watching.<br /><br />I cry, I weep, I beg you to spend 10 hours of your life re-watching Legend, Labrynth, Dark Crystal and Never Ending Story.  But do NOT waste a second of your precious waking time to see this trite piece'o'poop.  I promise, you will be disappointed.ght the ugly and sinister minions of the terrible evil King.

B0009S2T0M|4.0|If you're a fan of the drama/thriller genre with a taste for the unusual, this is definitely a film you'll enjoy.  This isn't a slam-bang action flick, so if you're expecting that you can stop reading and move on. :o) <br /> <br />I won't rehash the entire plot, since that's been done in other reviews, but suffice to say that our protagonist has been kidnapped for no apparent reason and imprisoned in what amounts to a motel room for 15 years. <br /> <br />There's great character building here, with none of the main players being simple one-dimensional cutouts.  The fight scenes are blissfully free of cliche's like whip-crack punching sound effects and the like, are very nicely framed, and show a hero who, for once, emerges as battered and tired as you'd expect in reality. <br /> <br />The entire film is beautifully shot, and you find yourself really sucked into the story.  This is, by the way, a story-driven thriller with a touch of film noir in the voiceover, but never ever drags because it's just so darned interesting.  I was hooked to the very last frame wondering what was behind it all and how it would all turn out. <br /> <br />As for the disturbing voilent elements that many mention, I didn't see anything over the top, certainly nothing worse than we've seen before.  And it's never gratuitous - there's a reason, either plot-wise or to invoke the viewer's emotion, for those mild shock/cringe moments.  The imfamous octopus scene will have you squirming, though, but in a giddy \\"I can't believe they did that\\" way. <br /> <br />The ending is the only reason I don't give this 5 stars.  Without giving away any spoilers, I think the protagonist's final confrontation with his nemesis was overdone - even considering the fact that he is toeing the line of desperation.  This is a small thing, though, not a deal-breaker, and the film resolves itself nicely and completely. <br /> <br />Definetely buy.  We need more great drama, great characters, great cinematography, and great story like this in movies.
B000I5X81K|5.0|How time has flown. It seems like only yesterday when I first chanced upon Josh on Ally McBeal, playing a lovelorn high schooler serenading the girl of his dreams. Now, he's in his mid-20s, a hugely successful recording artiste, and only getting better with each passing year. <br /> <br />Awake is definitely his best album to date, with Josh sticking to what he does well, but also experimenting much more, with excellent results. <br /> <br />Sure, the usual blend of Italian / Spanish love ballads are there, plus a number of competent original compositions. But I notice a significant lightening of tone on this CD -- more pop-friendly, even on the heavier pieces. <br /> <br />I like it. Granted, Josh has a fabulous voice ( I've always said he can sing circles around Andrea Bocelli ), but his deliveries on previous albums were always so serious, almost bordering on melancholy. This time round, he seems to be finally learning how to have fun. <br /> <br />Still, this takes nothing away from his ability to stir a listener's heart. The last few tracks are great examples of this, from his passionate rendition of the Romeo & Juliet theme, to the beautiful African-flavoured Lullaby and Weeping. His performance on the jazz/rock/bluesy Machine is terrific, but if you have the special edition ( with bonus songs Verita and Awake ), I strongly recommend you listen ( and listen very closely ) to the title track. <br /> <br />Clearly Josh's personal best -- in terms of both writing and recording efforts -- this haunting, gorgeous piece is exquisitely nuanced, with gentle inflections which can sometimes be easily missed if one pays little attention. <br /> <br />As he hits the chorus ( \\"So keep me awake / to memorize you / Give me more time / to feel this way / We can't stay like this forever / But I can have you here with me / today\\" ), I fully expect him to belt from the get go, but instead, he chooses a soft approach, which adds much more poignance and literally takes my breath away. <br /> <br />Josh has always struck me as extremely mature for his age, but his musical style previously seemed just a tad monotonous ( not that I minded, since I have every single CD/DVD he's ever released! ). But Awake proves he's a lot more than just a great voice.  <br /> <br />Well done.
0765310015|4.0|Gardens of the Moon starts slowly, is thoroughly confusing, and throws you into the middle of a sequence of action that involves a very large, complexly-related cast.  The magic is vaguely explained, the history of the world even less so, and there are so many characters it's almost impossible to keep track. <br /> <br />All that combines to make this first book in a long epic fantasy series fairly difficult to read- fairly difficult to even *want* to read, I might say.  I struggled through the first half, reading it over the course of a week. <br /> <br />The second half, however, I finished in a day.  Once this book clicks, it REALLY gets going.  By the time I realized what the plot of *this* particular book was (as opposed to the master plot of the series), I was hooked.  Did I understand the system of magic by the end of the novel?  Not really.  Did I know the history of the world?  Definitely not.  But by the end of the novel, I felt very much invested in the characters and the story, enough so that I have immediately picked up Deadhouse Gates.  For fans of George R. R. Martin, Robin Hobb, and other epic fantasy writers, give Erikson a try.  The book is difficult at first, but I have a feeling that the series is well worth the effort.
B000K9L32U|3.0|Before I get slammed by TT fans, let me just state for the record that I'm also an ardent supporter of the group. I have tonnes of their albums -- studio / live recordings, special editions, singles, etc -- and once spent a holiday trip to the UK hunting down every TT poster and other assorted paraphernalia I could afford to buy. I was devastated when the guys disbanded, and bought Beautiful World the minute it was released here. <br /> <br />That said, however, I also realize I'm now 10 years older, and that my taste in music has drastically changed. The hormones aren't exactly raging anymore, and I'm constantly bothered by the blokes' lacklustre vocal skills.  <br /> <br />It's one thing to be marketed as a boyband, but quite another to stage a comeback as serious musicians. It's tough, and sadly, it ain't happening here. <br /> <br />The problem? Well, maybe I should say \\"problems\\", of which there are many. The songs are all original, but forgettable. The vocals -- mediocre. I'm also miffed by the album's lack of direction -- does TT want to do rock, or pop, or something completely different?  <br /> <br />The only track I found enjoyable is Shine, which IMHO, comes closest to TT's essence of youthful fun. It's got a bit of a Beatles vibe to it, and definitely conjures images of the group's heyday when the guys sold out stadiums and had crazed groupies squealing everywhere they went. <br /> <br />I don't know how album sales are at the moment, but I suspect they'll release another CD in the near future, regardless of whether they make a profit or not. I can't discount the possibility that they'll hit paydirt one day -- TT alumnus Robbie Williams languished for about 5 years before writing Angel, Better Man and Strong -- but they're not getting any younger, and their fans aren't in their teens anymore either. <br /> <br />So good luck, guys. I hope you'll do a better job next time.  <br />
B00005JOLI|3.0|(Theatrical release).<br /><br />Eragon is a knock-off amalgamation of Star Wars, LOTR and other sci-fi/fantasy epics; it's mildly interesting because it's chock full of classic story ideas and characters, but the writing is second-rate. I was hoping the movie would be better than the book; that it would have been re-molded by the screenwriter and director into a more engaging package. It wasn't.<br /><br />The film looks good: the costumes and armor are beautiful, and the make-up is stellar. The digital dragon works well enough not to be distracting, and the rest of the visual effects are fine. The filmmakers assembled an amazing group of actors; veterans (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich) and newer faces alike, they all turn in amazing performances. (I would love to see Eragon and Arya in a different story.) But a film is a whole, and individual great performances don't count for much when they're not well-directed in a strong screenplay.<br /><br />If you liked the novel, you will like the movie. I enjoyed the movie because I like the fantasy genre, and because I am a student of filmmaking and appreciated the numerous positive elements. If you're new to the world of Eragon, and are looking for great fantasy entertainment, watch Lord of the Rings.
B000JJSM4S|3.0|Why is this 38$? I wanted to get it for my dad's christmas present, but the shipping time was 5-7 weeks so I went to Borders and found it on sale for $14.99. The Special edition with the DVD was $24. Why is it so expensive on amazon?
B000FDEU12|5.0|This is one of the only contemporary CDs that make it to my CD after 3-4 times. It's melodic yet full of energy. The Oud plays an important part in making this something that sounds different, Middle Eastern.
B000BT97AO|3.0|MirrorMask is a visual feast. A young girl, Helena, dreams of a real life as she has to work in her parents' circus. After a big fight with her mother, her mother falls ill and Helena feels guilty. Helena dreams she is in a weird place where the balance between light and dark is failing and Helena must find the charm to return the kingdoms to balance. <br /> <br />Her adventures allow us to see the beauty and the strangeness of the kingdoms: floating giants, flying monkey things, darkness bombs, wondering towers, libraries and books that fly home, and then friendsip, loyalty, trust, love. It's not clear what's happening at time but when it clicks it works. Helena finally tricks a sphinx in a way no other fantasy every has. It's filled with lots of little thing.  <br /> <br />It's definitely worth watching if you like your films a bit off-kilter and visually as well as emotionally entertaining.
B00005JPDS|5.0|I saw this movie on Sunday and this is definitely a movie to buy and keep.  We all know Will Smith is a great actor, but his son is amazing.  This was well put together!!
B000J10EQU|4.0|Yes, i was entertained with this Version of Superman... Instead of bringing us a darker ...more violent movie...like most of the franchises<br /><br />do to widen their audiences...they brought back the Superman we all<br /><br />loved from the previous movies....its more like a comic book..and<br /><br />i cant wait for the next one.
B0000DG7EU|5.0|Elton John has been a force in music for more than 30 years. He has an incredible amount of talent, both as an author of music, and as a performer. This collection attempts to pull together some of the best of Elton's work from his career, beginning with the \\"Elton John\\" album and ending with \\"Songs from the West Coast.\\"<br /><br />Nearly every song on this CD is musically good to excellent. Most of these songs were hits. As a sampler of Elton's music, this collection is a very good start. However, this CD does have a few flaws. The principal flaw is that while the CD purports to be Elton John's greatest hits, it does miss quite a few hits. The missing songs that stood out most noticeably to me are \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and \\"Pinball Wizard\\". However, there are other songs that were top 10 that were missed as well. It is impossible to represent Elton's greatest hits with only two CDs, and that is the main flaw of this collection.<br /><br />The difficulty with most \\"greatest hits\\" collections is choosing the songs. Regardless of how good a job you do, there will be a fan who thinks a song was neglected. Conversely, there will be other fans that think a song on the collection should have been excluded. Rather than complain about what was or wasn't on this collection, the focus should be on this collection alone. At this time, this collection is the best single representation of Elton over the bulk of his career. For the songs that were missed from this collection, you can add \\"Rare Masters\\" and \\"Love Songs\\", which pick up a lot more of Elton's early career and fills in more of Elton's best.<br /><br />Note that there are several versions of this collection.  The U.S. version has \\"Levon\\" and \\"Blessed.\\"  This version replaces those songs with \\"Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Made in England.\\"  I like all four songs, but choices have to be made to keep this collection to two CD's.<br /><br />With more than 40 albums, comprising hundreds of songs, choosing the 34 best is an absolutely terrible job. Similar to those people who would have added other songs, or subtracted some of those included, I too would have done something similar. However, we would never have agreed on the best. So take this CD as the best collection available to sample Elton's career. From that viewpoint, this CD rates 5 stars. Then you can add the other CDs I mentioned, and in the case of the classic albums and a few others, add original albums as well. We live in an imperfect world, thus a less than perfect collection of Elton's career is better than not having this collection at all.s an absolutely terrible job.

B000FGGE68|2.0|Ultraviolet in many ways is like one of those dead-on-arrival films: you know the film's not going to get any box-office so it's best to make a low-budget movie and release and get enough business in those first couple weeks before people realize it sucks and abandons the movie. However, unlike most films that were terrible out of the gate, this movie ultimately does have at least a couple of neat ideas and some cool visuals but it's barely held together by a tiny thread, bad performances, dialogue, CG and a weak story. <br /> <br />It's the future and mankind has been partially wiped out by a new virus, turning people into Hemophages. Vampire-teethed with moves out of the Matrix but with a short life-span, they've been looking for the cure for a long time. Their existence is threatened though when a new weapon is revealed and Violet, a kick-butt kind of girl with a weird need to change the color of her hair and clothes frequently, intercepts it. Turns out the weapon is actually a boy with special blood that Violet has to protect while trying to kill those who stand in their way. If it sounds cliche and cheesy to read, it's because it was cheesy and cliche to say. <br /> <br />A lot of these movies are obviously geared towards the action junkie type with fast fight choreography which gets hampered by MTV-affected editing like the camera can't sit still for more than 2 seconds. It's a shame though since there's at least some cool ideas here. There's a gravity...thing that doesn't get rid of gravity so much as alter it, allowing Violet to fall through ceilings or walk along them and in one logic-stretching scene, ride a motorcycle across a building before switching gears and riding up it. It's a really cool visual idea(if a bit taken from Episode II and probably some other movie I never saw) where Violet has a sword fight in darkness with the only light coming from their swords that are on fire. Unfortunately the film is just marred by practically everything(except for William Fichtner, seen in films like Armageddon, Perfect Storm or Contact). I can't tell whether this is a double-dip film in the future or they knew the film wasn't going to be a hit so they just put minimal extras. We have a commentary by star Milla Jovovich rather than the director and we have a rather fluffy making-of you've seen everywhere.  <br /> <br />Should you buy this? I'm going to have to say no. I mean there's enough interesting visuals or scenes to at least warrant a watch but most of the time the movie will just sit there on the shelf and one day you'll go \\"oh yeah, I forgot I bought this thing...wonder if I can sell it somewhere?\\"
B000AGTPUK|4.0|It seems like every time I let controversy over a movie keep me from seeing it in the theater that I regret it.  Such was the case with this movie.  I heard a lot of criticism over this movie and I let it keep me from seeing it in the theater.  How dumb was I?  This movie is a lot of fun and a feast for your eyes.  Modern film makers make few enough of these films, and this one is a winner.<br /><br />We meet a boy who is at that age where he begins to realize that the world appears not to have as many mysteries as he believed it did when he was little.  One of those mysteries is Santa Claus.  He truly wants to believe, but the evidence he has gathered tells him that there is no Santa Claus.<br /><br />As he falls asleep on Christmas Eve he hears a most unlikely sound: a train pulled by a steam engine outside his house.  He quickly runs outside to see a very real train making all sorts of hissing and ticking noises.  Then he sees and hears a conductor yelling \\"All aboard!\\"  The boy does not get on the train in spite of the conductor's best efforts to convince him to board.  As the train pulls away the boy changes his mind and barely makes it aboard for a journey to the North Pole!<br /><br />We soon meet several characters who will be keys to the plot of the movie throughout.  Tom Hanks plays no less than five characters:  the boy's father, the conductor, the boy himself, Santa Claus, and a hobo ghost.  I could tell it was Hanks easily enough with three of the characters, but the other two did not sound like Hanks at all, though I watched an interview with Hanks and I can tell you that it definitely was Hanks.<br /><br />This movie is filled with subtleties and a lot of fun.  I would rather allow you to watch the movie and discover the treats for yourself.  To tantalize you a little, the train does get to the North Pole, but only after running out of control and nearly sinking under water.  Even after the train gets to the North Pole our heroes end up taking a detour on one of the train cars, ending up somewhere in the heart of an operations center.  Even though I knew this movie was animated, the scene where three children cross a trestle over what appears to be a nearly bottomless pit was a bit tense.<br /><br />This movie is a visual treat throughout, but the visual effects from the point the train appears are spectacular.  The train is extremely detailed as are the animals, plants and people.  The animation is unusual when compared with animation we have seen in the past because of the type of computer animation used.  However, the results are phenomenal.  While the animation did distract me a lot sometimes, after having watched this movie umpteen times (for those who like this message, this movie can be addictive) I can tell you that I keep coming back for the message and not the graphics.<br /><br />This movie was nominated for a bunch of awards, including three Oscars, but it only won four.  I found it interesting that this movie won a Grammy Award for Best Song for a Motion Picture, and yet the Oscar people failed to recognize this movie for any sound awards, though the Oscar people nominated it for several sound awards.<br /><br />I believe that for many people the \\"Polar Express\\" will be a holiday favorite and tradition along with the Rankin/Bass classics, \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" and \\"A Christmas Story.\\"  If you have yet to see this one and you enjoy holiday stories, definitely give this one a try with an open mind and an open heart.<br /><br />Enjoy!a detour on one of the train cars, ending up somewhere in the heart of an operations center.

B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul was an incredible point in the Beatles growth as songwriters. \\"Nowhere Man\\" was the first Beatles song that had lyrics that strayed from romance. Also, this album has one of the greatest Beatles songs ever recorded, the incredible ballad by John Lennon called \\"In My Life\\". Paul also shines in this record, with great rockers like \\"Drive My Car\\", and love songs like \\"Michelle\\". George also takes a big step in this album, with the sitar laden \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and philosophical \\"Think For Yourself\\". There is nothing anyone can not like about Rubber Soul. It is one of the greatest albums by the greatest band ever, The Beatles. <br />Also check out other great Beatles albums such as Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, The White Album, and Abbey Road.
B000002OZY|5.0|The Who's first actual rock opera, Tommy. Written by Pete Townshend and first released in 1969. With 24 songs, (two of them are instrumental), it is a great CD. It has a number of songs under 3 minutes long, including It's A Boy, 1921, Eyesight To The Blind, Do You Think It's Alright, Fiddle About, There's A Doctor, Tommy Can You Hear Me, Smash The Mirror, Sensation, Miracle Cure, I'm Free, and Tommy's Holiday Camp, pretty much the whole thing. It has two very long ones though, Underture(10:09) and We're Not Gonna Take It(7:09). But they're good. It has got to be in your Who collection if you want to call yourself a fan
B00004Y7SF|1.0|The most horrible Xmas album I've ever bought! Doesn't even make you think of Xmas AT ALL. Felt like I was in a Speakeasy listening to a lounge singer. She should be ashamed to even put the word Christmas on this album. All the good reviews here MUST be from DIE-HARD Christina fans - or they've been drinking. Try Mariah's album, it's not a 'classic' as some say, but it's much better and actually has REAL Xmas music!!
B000008HZB|5.0|Like most, I got this album because I liked ELO.  This is definitely not an ELO album although some of the production has a bit of that feel (no big surprise as Jeff Lynne is probably now equally famous as a producer).  This album is mostly standards (Stormy Weather, that sort of thing) but they are very well done and really show off Lynne's voice, musicianship, and production style. <br /> <br />Over the 16 years since its release I keep hitting this album in my play mix and enjoy it more and more and now it is probably one of my favorites of all time.  I hope it is re-released so others can enjoy it as well-- when it is-- when it is I urge you to snap it up quickly.  If you haven't listened to the Traveling Wilburys work he's done you might also want to check that out since it is also very very good.
B00005JNS0|2.0|I have never been into Cars. I am not into NASCAR and I drive Fords older than the audience this movie is intended for. The movie is beautifully done. The digitized west look good, not as good as the real thing, but very good. The plot of this movie is basically \\"Sullivan Travels\\" or more exactly \\"Doc Hollywood.\\" There is a little \\"An officer and a Gentlemen\\" thrown in, but the plot is basically a highly successful city dweller gets stuck in the country, learns simplicity is sometimes better, develops sympathy and mercy for his fellow man, and finds love. Since I did not have the \\"Car\\" tie in, I found this movie rather boring. I rather watch \\"Doc Hollywood\\" again. Another thing that put me off was that though the cars vaguely resemble the actors who did their voices, I found the cars rather hard to sympathesize with. I found the faces emotionless. I wasn't rooting for the characters very much, except perhaps the tow truck.
B000I2J79K|5.0|While the songs are nothing new, the performances are great. The EW&F performances were all great. Chicago was good, they have lost a little in the vocals. When EW&F and Chicago are on stage together their performances rise to a whole new level. <br /> <br />The video and audio are very good. One minor complaint, this is the first HD-DVD I have seen that takes you out of the program to see the menu, all of the other HD-DVDs that I have watched allow the program to continue and display the menue over the ongoing program so you can select tracks without stopping the track you are watching/listening to. <br /> <br />All in all, a great concert, great sound and a great picture. If you are fans of either of these groups, get this HD-DVD.
B000H0MKOC|3.0|Although the title implies that this movie is soley an attack on the tobacco industry, it's really a hit at lobbyists and spin specialists in general. The focus of the movie is the art of forming your argument so that you are always right. Stephen Colbert has created a term for this idea: \\"truthiness\\".<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart portrays tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor as a very human guy who understands that he \\"gets paid to talk.\\" He justifies his job to himself (and his son) and explains that we \\"all have to pay the mortgage\\". The entire cast performs well in this film, aside from Adam Brody, who's turn as Rob Lowe's \\"yes man\\" is stiff and unfunny.<br /><br />While Thank You For Smoking is enjoyable and well-done satire, the story starts to run a bit long and in the end I think an hour and a half of The Colbert Report would provide more biting satire for this particular topic.
0812550706|5.0|It's a shame so many people, who think they don't like sci-fi, will never read this book, (and that means you TD!  lol) as it is one of the most enjoyable, most 'human' books I've ever read.  Without fail, anyone I've been able to cajole into reading it has enjoyed it - it's a classic.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|The Constant Gardener is a very realistic international thriller. Unlike movies starring Pierce Brosnan or Mel Gibson, the hero doesn't start shooting everyone in his path and showing up in exactly the right spot with the right clue to bring the \\"bad guys\\" crashing to the ground.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is a British Diplomat in Africa. When his wife is murdered in unusual circumstances, he starts looking into her death and what information she might have had that could have led to her being killed.<br /><br />What results is a fascinating look into big pharmaceutical companies and their desire to make money regardless of the cost to human life. On top of that is the idea that maybe we can't help everyone that is in need, but as Rachel Weisz's character remarks to her husband: \\"These are three people that we CAN help, right now.\\"<br /><br />The Constant Gardener gives us a view of a world and lifestyle that we would probably rather pretend doesn't exist. But it's hard to ignore, and lucky for us that filmmakers like Fernando Mierelles are ready to address these issues.
0812975219|4.0|I bought this book on finding it on the list of Fortune magazine's \\"Smartest Books of all times\\". People who follow value investing and fundamental analysis may disagree with Taleb's overemphasis on the importance of chance in the behavior of markets but Taleb makes some interesting hypotheses. One notable theory that Taleb supports is the \\"Black Swan\\" theory. Taleb is noticeably very well read and supports his observations well. <br /> <br />The writing style is easy and should give readers a peek into a contrarian view of how the markets operate and how some people do much better than others.
B000J10ERO|4.0|The flaw in this film is not the director, the cast, or the hero himself. Yes, the Superman of this movie seems less manly than last generation's Superman. But when you figure that by the filming of the next movie he will be older and probably bulkier, the casting seems, surprisingly, almost perfect. <br /> <br />Yes, Superman wears his underwear on the outside and looks almost like he's draped with the American flag. But superheroes are loved more by children and most would not want their super hero to look like the average joe. The world in which Superman lives is a simpler one in which good is good, bad is bad, and there isn't much in between. And it seems appropriate that the costumes are simpler also. Superman may not look as intimidating as someone like Wolverine from the Marvel universe but he is probably a better role model for children. <br /> <br />And yes, no one is completely sure what makes DC villains tick. It is something along the lines of: they are insane and want to cause as much death and destruction as possible. But the same can be said of many Marvel villains. <br /> <br />And sure, Superman is not as easy to relate to as a hero like Spiderman but many fans are content simply to admire and envy the powers of their hero even if they do not relate very much. <br /> <br />The major flaw in the movie is the plot. The formula of Lex Luther + green meteoric rock = a suitable antagonist for Superman can never be a foundation for an interesting movie. The plot needs much more tension to create interest. Superman kicking Lex Luther's tail in the end doesn't cause goose pimples any more than someone who squashes an ant with his little finger. What if Superman were to discover that some diabolical cosmic god, refusing to reveal its motivations, was rushing toward Earth to destroy it in his anger? Would Superman be capable of stopping such a force? Maybe this isn't the greatest idea but improving on Lex Luther and the green rock does not seem difficult. <br/> <br />Let's hope that next time Superman faces something bigger than himself.
B000GBEWHA|3.0|It's hard to think of a bigger slice of 1970's Hollywood kitsch than this candy-coated, mega-successful 1978 musical comedy. Capitalizing on the tidal wave of Eisenhower-era nostalgia pervasive on both big and small screens at the time, it manages to be stridently artificial and mindlessly entertaining at the same time, although it still boggles the mind that it has had such an afterlife, including sing-along versions playing at art-house movie theaters. Part of the ironic amusement is watching actors obviously in their late twenties and early thirties pretending to be teenagers. Credit should be given to director Randal Kleiser for his unapologetic stance on maneuvering the contrived silliness with spirit if not much finesse.<br /><br />Set in a period of the 1950's that existed only in Hollywood and lacking any semblance of reality or dramatic conflict, the threadbare plot focuses on greaser Danny, the cool leader of the T-Birds, and wholesome Sandy, a good-girl Aussie blonde enjoying a summer romance on the beach prior to senior year at Rydell High. Sandy was supposed to move back to Australia, but she ends up staying stateside and attending Rydell. With image being of the utmost importance, Danny initially rejects Sandy - now a cheerleader - when they meet again, and we follow all their romantic complications over the course of the school year until graduation. There is also the ongoing power struggle between the T-Birds and the rival gang, the Scorpions, as well as the peer-pressure shenanigans caused by the T-Birds' girlfriends, the Pink Ladies, headed by sleep-around tart, Rizzo.<br /><br />All of this merely provides an excuse for the various musical numbers, the most energetic being the ensemble pieces like the cleverly edited \\"Summer Nights\\" and the stylized \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" knock-off, \\"Greased Lightning\\". Most of the numbers are from the Broadway show, though there are some deliberately anachronistic insertions such as Barry Gibb's disco-accented title tune and the peppy funhouse duet, \\"You're the One That I Want\\". John Travolta is perfectly cast as Danny, even if his singing voice threatens to evaporate from his sincerity. Olivia Newton-John has the right manner and looks for Sandy, though she is hardly challenged to develop a compelling character here.<br /><br />The standout is Stockard Channing as Rizzo, the only character that has any connection to the reality of the times, and she expertly sings the mocking \\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\\" and frankly outdoes Newton-John on the touching \\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\\". Several familiar faces fill out the cast - Eve Arden in Miss Brooks mode as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar rather constrained as Coach Calhoun, Joan Blondell equally pallid as malt shop waitress Vi, Edd Byrnes as a Dick Clark-type lothario, Alice Ghostley as the auto shop teacher, Dody Goodman as the ditzy school administrator, and of course, Frankie Avalon serenading \\"Beauty School Dropout\\" to squeaky-voiced Didi Conn's Frenchy.<br /><br />Serious examination of the film is useless since it is more a cheery variety show with superficial references to the sexual politics of the 1950's. The new 2006 \\"Rockin' Rydell Edition\\" DVD package comes with extras that should satisfy fans. There is an insightful commentary track by Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch; eleven minutes worth of deleted scenes in black-and-white; a nostalgic \\"Grease Day\\" featurette that contains interviews with Travolta, Newton-John and producers Allen Carr and Robert Stigwood; and coverage of the 25th Anniversary DVD launch party, which includes spirited performances by Newton-John, Travolta and the remaining cast.funhouse duet, \\"You're the One That I Want\\".

B000062YAZ|5.0|I was a mere 20 year-old (and a dedicated fan of Thrash, Hardcore and the more extreme end of Heavy Music, including Slayer)when this album was released in 1986. I heard it soon after release and was blown-away by it. These were the days when the hair was thick, the waste was thin (not the other-way around as now) and each new Thrash/Speed/Death/Black Metal and Hardcore release was greeted with thorough enthusiasm. Even under these especially receptive conditions, 'Reign In Blood' STILL blew me away. <br /> <br />I am now a rather-more-cynical 40 year-old (but no less dedicated to Extreme-Heavy music). 'Reign In Blood' STILL blows me away. Sure, at the time of it's release and since then there were/are albums that are both faster and heavier (more 'extreme') but none of those albums have the quality of song writing (the 'kid's implications of a lack of song dynamics are just wrong), the scalpel-sharp execution, the brutal-yet-searing guitar tones (particularly on the leads; OK, King and Hanneman are not the best lead guitarists ever but the solos on this never fail to bite), the production qualities are still un-matched in extreme Metal, and, despite the 'kid's talk about Metallica's talent, Lars is not half the Drummer Dave Lombardo is. (Yes, I know I'm going on about the 'kid' but I felt some of his statements needed responding to. Eg: not one of the 'Thrash' albums (Savatage are NOT Thrash) match R.I.B in the above categories (except in the lead work). But, to give credit where it's due, he did give it a passing mark and did admit that he likes it more now that he's listened to it a few more times. I can only hope that with further listens he will see it as the legendary release it is.) <br /> <br />In short, I completely agree that this is the standard against which all other Thrash Metal albums must be judged. There were some that came close (Dark Angel's 'Darkness Descends', Sepultura's 'Beneath The Remains', Vio-Lence's 'Eternal Nightmare' to name a few) butnone quite reached the same pinnacle. This IS essential and you NEED to have it in your collection.
1400032717|2.0|Maybe because I'm Asperger's I don't see why everyone thinks it was so clever to write this from the persepective of an autistic boy.  Duh.  Has this seriously never been done before?  Additionally, after putting so much effort into the rest of the book, I couldn't believe the tacked-on, contrived ending.  It seemed like he got three-quarters of the way through and then got stuck and just wanted to finish it up any way he could.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Start with a dysfunctional family.  Who doesn't know one?  Who isn't part of one?  What does the word really mean?  Every character in this film is achingly real and actually in the end more healthy than a lot of seemingly strong familial relationships.   <br /> <br />While put off by the constant use of the \\"F-Word\\", if one can get past it, the story pretty much sells itself.  Using the vehicle (no pun intended) of the roadtrip as \\"close-quarters\\" therapy for the whole family was tremendous.  Steve Carrell was outstanding in this film in particular.   <br /> <br />I recognized the little girl from \\"Signs\\" where she was also very good.  Innocence impersonating what she assumed was a performance imagined from the loving mind of her grandfather on stage was a revelation.  Sticking together, binding to those that love you is an important aspect of this film.  Unconditional love takes a back seat through most of this film however and surfaces just as things go whirling out of control. <br /> <br />The older brother, wearing a t-shirt stating \\"Jesus was Wrong\\" again turned my stomach a bit but, being a Christian, I understand the attacks we must undertake in His Name.  Yes, I am a Christian and yes I loved this movie.  I do not endorse all aspects of the film but I must say this film healed wounds that I never knew I had entirely. <br /> <br />If I can say one thing to someone considering this movie, it is \\"give it a chance\\".  Many believers shy away from some films because of language, (myself being one of them) but sometimes we miss out on a great piece of film that can touch us in many ways.  \\"Life as a House\\" springs to mind.   <br /> <br />However, if language offends you so much that you can't get through the film, this is not the film for you.  How many of us backed away from \\"Good Will Hunting\\" because of the language and missed a tremendous moment between Robin Williams and Matt Damon when Robin Williams hugged Matt Damon and simply told him \\"it's not your fault..\\"?
0743454537|4.0|To have read 99% of the book and become involved in the characters, to appreciate what great story this has been...and then, BAM, a cheap and mean ending that will inspire you to throw the book across the room.....imagine if at the end of Gone With the Wind...after Scarlet raises her fist and declares she will never be hungry again...she walks off and steps on a land mine (or something appropriate to the era) and blows to pieces.....that is the type of ending you are given here.   <br />
0141185163|4.0|I'm a fan of George Orwell and a student of the Spanish Civil War so, when I saw this book in a Canadian book store, I snatched it up.  It is a compilation of all of Orwell's writings in reference to the Spanish Civil War in which he participated (on the Republican side).  His \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" comprises half of the book with the other items culled from letters, book reviews, and letters to the editor (many in response to reviews by others of \\"Homage to Catalonia\\").  Much of it is repetitive but included for the sake of completeness.  For example, Orwell is quick to respond to any mischaracterization of the POUM; the Troskyite Party organization that he served with in Spain.  Whatever book came out that gave the wrong perspective of POUM was sure to get a public letter of correction from Orwell.  One can understand Orwell's concern for the abused party but the focus on this and several other issues tends to detract from the book's impact.  What is really impressive is his observations on the overall Civil War and its' effects on Spain and the world.  My favorite selection from the book, apart from \\"Homage to Catalonia\\", was one of the last entries entitled \\"Looking Back on the Spanish War\\".  Written in 1942, it was aided by a perspective of a world at war that arose from many of the same issues that fueled the Spanish Civil War.  Orwell gives an excellent explanation of many issues affecting the world then and now.   <br /> <br />I had read \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" a few years back and decided not to reread it as part of this book.  Perhaps I was missing the full appreciation of this book by not rereading \\"Homage\\".  However, after reading \\"Looking Back on the Spanish War\\", I went back and read the beginning of \\"Homage\\".  You will too once you read that essay.
B000H5U65C|5.0|This album may very well be the best hard rock/metal album ever created. It has been the only CD in my changer for the last several months. I cant believe these guys arent putting up Metallica or Pantera numbers as far as sales. Not that I want them to be huge, cause maybe i'll feel abit more passe about their esquisite craftsmanship if everyone and their brother were touting Mastodon hoodies & bumper stickers, but for real people, if you are a rock fan, metal fan, improv jazz fan, or just a fan of good music, do yourself a favor and check these guys out. It may not be immediatly acssessable, but listen a couple more times, then watch the DVD. These guys are f%$#@ amazing. I wont go into a detailed review of each song or anything, cause I dont want to spoil all the fun. But pretty please, do what you gotta do (ie download, steal, borrow, beg mom for 10 bucks)I guarantee you will be glad you did.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|To anyone out there who bashed her singing talents on this cd all I have to is,  Are you kidding me????. As far as I'm concerned, she has the best singing voice of ANY female recording artist out there,period. She'll still be putting out great music while Britney Spears keeps on getting the bad press.This cd is excellent!!!.
0618680004|3.0|The book's message is perfectly correct.  If we use the same criteria to evaluate the God hypothesis as we do to test the credibility of any unseen force, we find no reason to believe in him.  The Abrahamic God is overwhelmingly improbable and the concept is internally inconsistent as proferred by organized religion.  Theology, therefore is basically the codification of the Emperor's New Clothes.<br />Although the points are presented well with very good referencing, my objection is that the book seems \\"padded\\" with unnecessary and distracting asides to the reader.  He describes trivia regarding the personal lives of the thinkers he's quoting and often catalogues the mistreatment of atheists by theologians, police, editors, etc.  To reduce these interruptions I stopped reading the copy within parentheses or after em-dashes, and thus my mind remained more on-topic.<br /><br />The title is succint and effective.  However, in psychiatry the term delusion means a fixed false belief that is not shared by one's subculture.  Thus when applied to believing in God, delusion may not be strictly accurate.
B000GIXEIG|3.0|The movie begins with a young Grendel watching his father get killed by a band of Danes over a stolen fish.  Leading the pack is the future King Hrothgar, who spares the boy.  Decades later and young Grendel has grown to become a giant of a man.  Emotionally, he has never matured since his father's death, but has become a vengeful spirit that prowls the Danish highlands and kills Danish men to avenge his father's death.  Words of these cruelties spread far and wide, and draw Beowulf there with 12 warriors.  They promise Hrothgar to rid the land of the beast.  For weeks they camp out at Hrothgar's village, taunted by the occasional sighting of Grendel.  Beowulf's men finally find Grendel's cave, and desecrate it.  This brings Grendel upon them the next night.  They capture him, but he cuts of his own arm to free himself.  Grendel makes it to the sea where he wades out to die and be carried away by his mother.  The mother then attacks the village.  Beowulf and company track down the mother and kill it in turn.      The plot is simple enough, now lets critique the other parts of the movie.  First the dialogue.  Most of the cast is Scandinavian, and speak English with various Scandinavian accents.  This increases the script's authenticity.  Unfortunately, half the dialogue is incomprehensible as the script has them speak something close to Old English.  What is worse is that the DVD does not come with English, or any other subtitles or captioning.      Next is the action scenes and ensuing special effects.  Being a movie of swords and monsters, and with star Gerard Butler having played numerous sword fighting roles, I came in with high expectations.  I was sorely disappointed.  The various warriors seem quite skilled swordfighters when fighting each other, but somehow become novices when fighting Grendel.  The latter seems quick enough to deflect and dodge all their blows, without any shield or weapon for himself!      Third, the cinematography is quite good.  From theocean scenes to the snowy plains to the rocky shores; the settings portray a world of stark but dangerous beauty, mostly untouched and untamed by human civilization.      Last, the character portrayals ranged from average to above-average.  King Hrothgar seems a broken man, and plays the part well.  Beowulf is the eager warrior but reluctant hero.  He will make the sacrifices but disavow the glories... quite the combination.  Grendel himself seems a man possessed, alternating between episodes of childish imbecility, animal-like wrath, and a canny prey.  Unfortunately, the long hair, dreary clothes and funny accents make the rest of the characters all seem the same.  The worst portrayal was Grendel's mother.  How did Grendel's father ever mate with that beast!  She was over 7 feet tall and had webbed feet and hands.    Overall, an okay movie.  As this is the first movie version of the Beowulf epic, it seemed worth the time to watch it.
B00003CWPL|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Avoid at all costs.
B00006CXSS|5.0|With the number of reviews of \\"Band of Brothers\\" standing at over nine hundred, and the average rating being five stars, there is really nothing I can add to what has already been said. But I will weigh in anyway and say \\"Band of Brothers\\" is by far the best WWII film I have ever seen. Produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the ten-part HBO miniseries follows the men of Easy Company, 101st Airborne, from boot-camp through D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge to the taking of Hitler's Eagle's Nest. Each episode has a different director and focus, but the series maintains an overarching storyline with a common theme and common characters. Hanks' and Speilberg's involvement with the project make comparisons to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" inevitable; like many other reviewers, I think \\"Band\\" is an improvement over \\"Private Ryan,\\" as the longer format allows for greater character development, and ultimately offers a more realistic psychological portrayal of what these particular soldiers endured. The film is also notable because for many it will serve as an introduction to the work of Stephen Ambrose, whose book of the same title is the basis for the miniseries.    I absolutely recommend the \\"Band of Brothers\\" DVD box set to anyone who is at all interested in WWII history, or to anyone who is simply interested in seeing a great film. All of the extra features, especially the documentary (which features interviews with the real life survivors of Easy Company), are excellent. The only oversight by the producers is the lack of English subtitles; beyond that, everything in this set is golden. Like so many other reviewers here, I believe \\"Band of Brothers\\" is destined to become a classic.
055358202X|4.0|Feast of Crows by George R. R. Martin is the fourth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series. Each book in this series is massive, so if you are looking for a quick, but fun, read - you need to look elsewhere. This book (and series) is extremely engaging, there are quite a few plots and subplots scattered throughout the book. This is mainly do to Martin's style of writing each chapter for a different character and each character has their own plot arc. If you are not ready to invest time and energy in understanding each character and their situation you may want to hold off. If you are ready, you need to start this series at A Game of Thrones or else a great deal of things will not make sense.<br /><br />There are no less than seven plot lines in this book (maybe more) and countless other sub-plots appear as well. This forces the reader to not `gloss' over any chapter or paragraph for fear of becoming instantly lost and confused. The plots are written in such a way as to try and give the reader feelings for all the different situations even when the reader has been afforded the other side of the situation and considers a character the `bad guy' type. There are times in this book that the plot lines seem to really drag for a couple characters. It seemed like Martin needed to get once vital piece of information out there, but took fifteen to twenty pages for a character to mutter one line of importance. For a 976 page book, this shouldn't happen as much. If Martin feels the need to have that many pages and make a tome, it should all be important. I just didn't feel that with this book. Don't get me wrong though, once you finish this book you can look back and there are quite a few things of great importance that do occur and are set up for future books. It is a good story for sure.<br /><br />The characters in this book truly make the book. Without these rich vivid characters the book would really suffer due to the length and at times slow plot. As I mentioned above Martin continues to write each chapter for a different character. The one problem I saw with writing a chapter for a character at a time as quite frankly there were two characters I could have cared less about and reading their chapters made it seem like a chore. Martin has a way with writing his characters that he challenges you not to root, at least for a little bit, for the `bad guys'. Ye, even using the term bad guy for some characters is a challenge at times. He almost seems to prescribe to the ideal that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. If I read about a character that is fighting a character I don't like than the first is a good guy... at least for a little bit. I like how Martin fleshes out his characters and allows them to become their own entities. He put them through hell and allows us to watch how they manage. For the most part they are a joy to read.<br /><br />My overall impressions of this book aren't nearly as high as the first book in this series. For whatever reason Game of Thrones, to me, seemed like a complete book and encompassed so many things. Yet, at times reading Feast of Crows seemed more like work than relaxation. There were a few chapters in this book that, honestly, I am still not sure why they were included other than to let us know that characters was still there and doing something. I consider this book the lesser book, thus far, of this series. It just didn't do, for me, what the other books have been able to do. There can be several reasons for that, but the end result is the same.<br /><br />I think past fans of Martin and the SoIaF series will appreciate this book as it does move some all encompassing plot lines forward. Fans just getting into this series need to read the first three before this one. Overall, I would say this was a decent book, but it lacked the magic of Thrones for sure.e Martin continues to write each chapter for a different character.

B0009P42S2|3.0|I only recently became a fan of anima dew mainly to two movies, [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]] and [[ASIN:B0001XAPZ6 Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind]]. I love these movies with a passion, and since seeing them decided to see all of Miyazaki's movies. Well, I've seen all his movies that my local rental store has, so what now? I decided to expand my view of anima, see something else, and see if anyone can possibly be as good as Miyazaki. I saw [[ASIN:B00070Q84U Grave of the Fireflies]] and loved it.<br /><br />But then I saw Steamboy. All I have to say about this movie is, well, it isn't Miyazaki. Sure the animation looks great, nothing Miyazaki has ever made looked quite this good, not even Spirited Away. But this movie lacks the fun and awe of Miyazaki's works. Miyazaki's movies have great, and I do mean GREAT, stories and some of the best characters ever made. Steamboy lacks both of these. The story here is pretty stupid overall. We are apparently supposed to sympathize with Ray's granddad, but he was crazy. I'm telling you he belonged in a loony vill, and Ray's dad seemed to care about him, instead of just using him like the grandpa did.<br /><br />And I never found myself actually likening these people. Ray didn't know what he wanted to do, his dad was too, what's the word, Darth Vader like, and his grandpa was crazy and preachy. Who's left? Miss? She was a brat, and a stupid one at that. Unlike in any of Miyazaki's films, these people were just. . . there.<br /><br />If you want to see some great anima, see Spirited Away, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, or any of Myazaki's movies. Also check out Grave of the Fireflies. if you read this review, please leave a comment. if you read this review, please leave a comment.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|His style is spare by nature, so when I suggest that after four years between albums I expected something from Damien Rice with more meat on the bone, I'm not talking about guitars and keyboards.  This album, while a bit fleshier musically than the first, falls short in substance.  His vocals remain charmingly idosyncratic, but thematically 9 just isn't as ambitious or inspired as O.  Rice's music is best listened to with headphones so that one can appreciate all of the little inflections, whispers, strings and intonations that are something of his stock in trade.  The album would have benefitted had Lisa Hannigan been utilized more, though it's likely that Rice was a little wary of looking like a one trick pony.  What made O unique was the personal nature of the songs, the conversational elements and confessional qualities.  With 9 he continues to take risks both lyrically and stylistically, but it really doesn't resonate as effectively as his last. It's worth buying, but it's not likely to blow you away.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I haven't seen the Donner version of Superman 2 yet but I have read many online reviews both professionally and personally on it. My opinion on this is that people are criticizing this film too harshly without fully understanding why the film is the way it is. Donner isn't just giving us \\"his\\" version of the film but giving us what it would had been like had he finished working on part 2. I'm sure he understands this with Superman 1 ending the way it does, that his version of part 2 wont fully make sense to many people. In most of the reviews I've read on here, people are bashing the ending of the film where he turns back time. Had Donner completed working on part 2, a different ending would had taken place in part 1. We have to look at this film as not a direct link to part 1 but more of an example of what it would have been like if he finished the film himself. Ofcourse Donner's version of part 2 isn't going to make much sense if connected with the original version but had he been allowed to complete it back in the late 70's it would have been. I appreciate Donner for allowing us the opportunity to see key scenes of his that were taken out of the original version, just so we can say \\"oh this is what they originally had in mind when they were making this movie\\". No, the scenes aren't fully completed, no, they dont fully make sense, yes, there were screen test used in it (remember he's using the only material he had available at the time to be able to make this DVD just so he can be able to express his version of the movie). Today the only original version of part 2 is the Lester version which altered the ending to Superman 1, the Donner version is its own separate entity and example of the Superman franchise which is just giving us an artistic expression of what it would had been like had he continued on as director. So dont bash this movie as a sequel to part 1 because it isn't its sequel, just another vision from a different perspective. If it helps, pretend theturn back time ending to part 1 doesn't exist and that Donner's version is where it picks up from. This is just a treat for fans who already own or saw the Lester version and are curious to see what Donner wanted to originally do. If you haven't seen either version of part 2, then I recommend you buy the Lester's version for thats what WB gave us. This version is just for artistic expression only and not for watching a sequel to Superman the movie. Oh by the way, even though Superman turned back time, the bully is still a jerk who needed to be taught a lesson so that maybe he'll think twice before trying to hurt somebody else in the future, look at it that way.
B00005JMAH|5.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is the darkest and yet the best of first three movies in the series. Death, or the threat of it, hovers over everyone like a Dementor, threatening everyone. Innocent blood is going to be spilled, and then is spilled, and then is not spilled, after all. Oddly, the movie begins with good old fashioned magic fun. Aunt Marge becoming a human blimp and the ensuing bus ride are hilarious and kids love them. It doesn't take long, though, before the lighting dims and things grow dark. <br /> <br />After that, I don't know if this is a kid's movie anymore. Some events are truly frightening (to this adult, at least) and tragic--for a while. Also the plot twists at several points, and the whole time travel issue is complex. Don't misunderstand this: the movie remains powerful and delightful. The cast is rock solid and the effects are a marvel--I particularly enjoyed the portrait gallery and the map. Director Alfonso Cuaron's work is incredible. Like \\"Moulin Rouge\\" the camera never stops moving, dollying in, panning out, zooming in, etc. Unlike \\"Moulin Rouge\\" however, I didn't experience motion sickness and an epileptic seizure. <br /> <br />One last note, the extras on this set are well-worth the price. I enjoyed the overview of the portraits a lot!
B00009P1MP|5.0|Not meaning for this to be a nostalgic piece, but of ALL the songs that I most remember when I was 20 years old, one heard this all over the radio in 1972. This can both make me smile, and cry at the same time.Those of you that are my peers, know what I am talking about. This entire album, from start to finish, is a \\"must\\" for every record(that's right-I said record)collection.
0670034711|1.0|If you are looking for a book that describes the life an idle, affluent, rich woman then this is the book for you.  It should be titled I EAT FOR ME, I PRAY FOR ME, I LOVE FOR ME. My journey on a totally self cented, indulgent year abroad to figure out WHY THE WORLD DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND ME. This book is  a road map for how to live a totally self centered life and make money too.   <br /> <br />She has insightful thoughts on mental illness and her travels in Italy are entertaining. From there on in it is down hill. <br /> <br />Her political views are appauling.  She has more sympathy for a Bali illigal imigrant in the US that has been deported because he is an illigal imigrant then she does for the 9/11 victims fot the WTC bombings.  She care more about fundinga home for a woman in Bali that is a money scam but she is too niave to figure this out on her own.  How passe to donate money to good honest international or national charity.   <br /> <br />In the end she is the same person as at the beginning of the book, minus all the guilt for being so self centered.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is Gore's film relaying his work and information about global warming.  The film is very well done, seamless enough that I forgot I was watching a film.  He makes it personal enough for the viewer to relate to, yet it isn't about him or his agenda at all.  The most significant thing this film delivers is the message that every individual can change how they live to help the environment.  He doesn't even necessarily have to go into specifics of how to live; rather, it's the way he encourages his audience that every person counts, ever action counts.  Break out of the patterning and act.  In fact, one of the most memorable bits of it is not in the film at all, but at the end in the credits.  The animation of the credits recycles the letters into new phrases and names, and one of them re-arranges itself to say, \\"If you believe in prayer, pray that people will find the strength to change.\\"  Impressive, really.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|For those who like fast-paced movies with a lot of action, this one delivers in spades.  Matt Damon (Jason Bourne) is a former operative for a ultra-secret organization that was shut down 2 years previously.  He fights with nagging memories that haunt him.  The movie opens with his sweetheart being shot while sitting in a speeding car next to him.  From that moment on it's non-stop action, hopping from continent to continent.  The directing in this film is absolutely top notch, and Damon is superb!  Loved it!
0307341542|5.0|This was one of those books that, once you start reading, you simply cannot put it down.  I read it in one day and had nightmares about it that night.  I've never had nightmares about any book I've ever read!<br /><br />I read several chapters before I even realized that the author was a woman and that this was a first time novel.  The plot was tight and I was totally fooled about who the killer was, although I had my suspicions.  If you love fast-paced, well-written thrillers, then this is the book for you.  I'm eagerly anticipating her next one!!

B000JJRIN4|4.0|People are being quick to tell you the new Gwen album is a big ugly disappointment, but I think they're only half right.  Songs like \\"Orange County Girl\\" and \\"Breakin' Up\\" are dreadful attempts to compete with current dance-hiphop trends.  They're just dull and bored and not worth hearing.  I can't believe such innovative producers as the Neptunes stooped this low.  17 year-old gangsta wannabes will love blasting this crap through the subwoofers of their low-riders.  And Gwen raps as good as anyone with a state-of-the-art recording studio. <br /> <br />But some of this album will blow your mind.  The sonically brilliant \\"Wonderful Life\\" was produced by Nellee Hooper (known for his work with Garbage, Bjork and Massive Attack) and co-written with Linda Perry (critically acclaimed songwriter).  Its layered electronic perfection has already been compared with Depeche Mode and other New Wave acts.  Gwen croons so freely at the end of \\"Early Winter\\" (also produced by Hooper) you'd almost think she's Cyndi Lauper.  It's amazing how much more confident these tracks sound.  On half the album, she actually sings, and it's quite gorgeous. <br /> <br />*SOLUTION* <br />Get on iTunes and download these songs: \\"Wonderful Life,\\" \\"Early Winter,\\" \\"Fluorescent,\\" \\"Don't Get It Twisted,\\" \\"The Sweet Escape\\" and \\"Now That You Got It.\\"  And maybe \\"Yummy,\\" but only if you liked Kelis' \\"Milkshake.\\"  It'll save you the time, money and effort of buying the whole CD while giving you exactly what you want: the best music of Gwen's solo career.
B000E5N62U|5.0|This is an album that didn't seem to get much publicity. I'm a huge Fagen/Steely Dan fan, to the point that I'm usually camping out in front of Best Buy (metaphorically) a month before they release anything. But I hadn't even heard about this one until a couple weeks after it had been released. <br /> <br />Now I realize that my own obsession with Fagen is, to a large extent, personal. I mean, I think there are things he's done that are categorically brilliant, and anyone that has any interest in music should have Countdown to Ecstasy, Aja, and The Nightfly in their collections. But I'd never try to push my own completist-level fandom on anyone else. So when Fagen or Steely Dan put out a new disc, I usually get it, love it, and keep it to myself. <br /> <br />The first time I listened to Morph the Cat, that's about how it appeared--another solid Fagen album to keep me happy for a couple years until their next release. But then I kept listening, and subsequent spins revealed depths to this disc that even Donald himself rarely reaches. After a couple months I realized that this is unassuming, unpublicized little entry into the catalog was probably the best thing he's made since at least 1982's The Nightfly. <br /> <br />Musically, it's still the funky, understated jazz fusion that is his specialty. But he's dispensed with some of the patterns he's fallen into in his last few albums and given his music a simmering tension, and a tight, subtle groove that matches anything in his best work. And of course, the consummate musicianship and the every-note-in-its-place perfectionist production qualities (for better or worse) are as tight here as anything he's made since the '70s. <br /> <br />Lyrically, he's never been more intimate or personal. There are songs on here about aging, politics, and life in post-9/11 America, that are unusually pointed for someone as ordinarily obtuse as Fagen. And although his meanings are still obscured by his trademark wry, subversive wit, obscure allusions, metaphor and allegory, he actually puts short explainations in the liner notes next to they lyrics, so that it doesn't take teams of scholars to figure out what the heck he was talking about. It's about as transparent and personal as I've ever seen him. <br /> <br />In short, even for a fan this album really surprised me. It's the best thing he's done in decades (and that's going up against some solid competition). In fact, if I were going to introduce someone for the first time to Steely Dan/Donald Fagen, this album wouldn't be that bad a place to start. And if that doesn't say something impressive about a work produced 35 years into an artist's career, I don't know what does.

0767817710|4.0|This movie appears to try hard to be a serious western... but with the wild special effects, and cliche-ridden dialogue, I doubt that was it's true intention.  Instead I tend to believe and view this film for face value, and that is GOOD entertainment...  if you don't believe me, just listen to and watch the reactions of anyone who is watching this movie for the first time.  They are shocked, surpised, and grossed out by some of the things that happen to the gunfighters. <br /> <br />It's always fun to watch this movie.
6304698623|5.0|My 9 year old daughter has seen this movie a couple of times a year for the past 4 years.  We watched it together the other night, and I was amazed at how much it has influenced her, and I understood so many of the things she has said and done over the past few years.  These influences have been magical, have spawned her creativity, have been channeled with her child's view of the world that I wish she will always have.  She is a dreamer and a believer in the good of the world, of people, of love, of magic, of stories, of being a princess.  I have never cried so many times while watching a movie as I did with this one. Seeing it with her and remembering seeing it with her only makes me love her more than I already thought was possible. Thank you for making it.
032147404X|5.0|This is an excellent book about Digital Photography. I read it in one night, and now keep it in my camera bag for reference. There is a lot to sort out when attempting to take great photos, ISO, Shutter Speed, Aperture, white balance and colors, let alone composition and subjects. Scott does an incredible job of addressing all of these and much more. You can read it in a couple hours, but you will benefit from it for life. I have bought three photography books that were specifically geared towards digital and this was the least expensive, the most portable and by far the best.  <br /> <br />This book is a great place to start if you are looking to move from snap-shots to great photos. As with most digital photography books it is really geared towards D-SLR owners, but it is all pretty applicable with my Panasonic DMC-FZ50. Many of the tips are not camera dependant, but it may be a little harder benefit from if you have a compact digicam.  <br /> <br />One reviewer was really bothered by his \\"funny\\" openings to some of the chapters and some jokes. It didn't bother me, this is a complex subject adding a little humor can make the learning process more enjoyable. <br /> <br />Matt <br />
B00005JOLI|2.0|Just lately, in the Hollywood binge of adaptations, we've been getting not what people would expect. With the newest CHRONICLES OF NARNIA adaptation being boring, I don't understand how this could be possible.<br /><br />Myself being a Canadian, I wonder how this crap was greenlit. I saw this yesterday in the theater and fell asleep 3 times. I liked the book, but this was just uninteresting.<br /><br />Here are two things you should be advised of before seeing this movie:<br /><br />1. The movie is NOTHING like the book- It seemed to me as if somebody read 5 chapters of the book and went \\"Hey, I have an idea- This book is pretty impressive so far, so if we made a movie, despite the fact I we only know a little of the book, we could make a million dollars!\\" This movie barely follows the book's plotline.<br /><br />2. The acting and special effects are terrible- At a couple times, I had a stomach ache, and the kids would have one too.<br /><br />To the director who decided to make this: Stop this madness NOW! We I saw a couple people leaving the theater... and I'm not surprised.<br /><br />And so that's it for me trying to provide a spoiler-free review, And infact, it's my first Plot-free review in a while. Geez, what would you expect from a movie with 20 minutes of stuff from the book, war and peace?
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|Pity, that I can only give it 5 stars, it deserves another 2 stars. This artist was used as background to give perfect poignance to two Scrubs episodes. \\"Closer\\" when I heard it on the 4th season episode \\"My best laid plans\\" was so moving, so appropriate, and sounded so good, that I just became obsessed with hearing it again. Oddly, I am not a music afficianado, and prefer instrumental over vocal. However this song and this artist trumps all other music preferences
B00005JNS0|5.0|\\"Cars\\", the latest offering from the animation geniuses at Pixar, is a sweet little movie that combines a witty (and spectacular) look at NASCAR racing with a leisurely story line that harks back to simpler times on the road. All the characters are- yes- cars! This may take a little getting used to, but it works well. <br />        Our hero, cocky young race car Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), earns his way into a race-off for the Piston Cup, but he falls out of his truck and winds up in the colorful, but faded, Western town of Radiator Springs (a beautifully rendered duplicate of northern Arizona). There, he does community service as a paver while meeting the various  <br />\\"car-acters\\" in town. The most interesting of these is Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), a sleek vintage '51 Hudson Hornet who serves as mayor, judge and doctor. There's also Mater, the zany tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy); Sally, the Porsche and former hotshot LA lawyer (a likable Bonnie Hunt), and a great little comic-relief duo: Luigi and Guido, the Italian-accented Fiat and forklift who run a tire store (Tony Shalhoub). Lightning <br />learns a little more about life and returns to the speedway a new man- I mean car. It's all nicely done and has a different kind of feel than other Pixar movies- more of an easy-going road trip than a slam-bang adventure or undersea odyssey. The racing sequences, narrated by real-life announcers Bob Cutlass (I mean, Costas) and Darrell Waltrip, add genuine excitement that even non-gearheads like me will love. Did we mention that even the announcers are cars? <br />        \\"Cars\\" comes in a package that's a little slimmer than the other Pixar DVDs, but this movie looks good. Two shorts, the cute \\"One Man Band\\" <br />(two street musicians, a boy, and an Italian town square) and \\"Mater and the Ghostlight\\", are part of it along with a short but interesting documentary that details Pixar honcho John Lasseter's surprising car background (his dad ran a bodyshop), love of Route 66-style road culture and research into NASCAR broadcasts. There's also an epilogue with little spoofs of past Pixar hits like \\"Monster Trucks, Inc.\\" that will delight outtake fans. Musical choices include the doo-wop classic \\"Sh-Boom\\" (the Chords' version) and, at the end, a nifty take on \\"Route 66\\" by John Mayer. Randy Newman's back, too, with the poignant \\"Our Town\\" (sung by James Taylor). <br />       \\"Cars\\" may not wow you at first, aside from the racing portions, but it will grow on you. It might be a little slow in parts for the very young. Give it a spin- you'll enjoy this ride.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Sure, there have been better sung Nemorinos than Rolando Villazón's: Di Stefano, Kraus, Bergonzi, even the young Alagna, but none has been better acted or more convincing as a whole. In fact his acting is so good that it's on the level of the finest Broadway standards. He moves with the grace of a ballet dancer, and quite frankly, he is a joy to watch. And last but not least his singing is quite, quite good. Netrebko looks like a million dollars, and if she is not a master belcanto soprano like Scotto, she makes a pretty, nay, gorgeous Adina. The Otto Schenck production is nice to look at and frames well Villazón restless Nemorino. The public gives a standing ovation to the tenor, and in Vienna, that is something, before that he is asked to repeat Una Furtiva Lagrima to tremendous applause. In general I enjoyed this Elisir more than the Alagna on DECCA, it has a more adorable soprano, and a star performance from Villazón. The old Scotto-Bergonzi from Florence will always be a historic document of tremendous importance.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|I believe that if Richard Donner had been able to finish this movie back when he started it, that it would have turned out to be a true gem.  Unfortunately, trying to do it many years later has turned out to be an insulting effort. He should have left well enough alone.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERTS!!!!<br /><br />Getting his power back after he found out Zod was on Earth, was certainly interesting (absorbing Jor-El's essence and/or power) , but the original left it up to your imagination as to how he got his powers back.<br /><br />In the original, after he got his powers back and Zod was in the Daily Planet, you saw the newspaper stand and the newspapers starting to blow away as the majestic Superman March started playing.  This got you excited because, as stated before, you didn't know how or if he got his powers back.  the music and visuals portrayed a heroic moment that is indicative of the character himself.  Not only was this music missing from this moment, but we already knew he was Superman again.  And then came that terrible line.  \\"General, haven't you ever heard of freedom of the press.\\"  How stupid.  This wasn't Donner's \\"vision\\" of how the movie should have been, it was just something different that he was able to use to distinguish his version from the original.  he basically took any clip that was different from the original.  Also, what does that statement have to do with anything that was going on in the story.  How would Zod have received that exression with any meaning, function, or association.  The original \\"General, would you like to step outside?\\"  Was more relevant and dramatic for the scene.<br /><br />Donner needs to be seriously critisized for his use to the \\"turn back time\\" bit.  How did he think he could get away with that.  Basically he is calling us stupid.  How could Clark go back to the resteraunt to beat up that guy if it the first fight never happened?  What an insult Mr. Donner.<br /><br />i have many more criticisms but instead, a bright point.  the way Lois found out about Clark being Superman was far cooler in this version than the original.  It will bring a smile to your face.<br /><br />I was amused by one of the deleted schenes where the police come to the Fortress to arrest Lex Luthor.<br /><br />I am very fond of all things Superman, and I am not sorry I bought this DVD, but it was not well conceived.  How could WB have allowed this?t instead, a bright point.  the way Lois found out about Clark being Superman was far cooler in this version than the original.

0763631205|5.0|Many versions of Dickens' classic \\"A Christmas Carol\\" are actually abridgements (done more or less smoothly) but this version is complete and unabridged. Even if you think you are familiar with the book you may find upon reading this one that you previously had read a shortened version!  The completeness of this volume would be reason enough to add it to your library, but the quality of the pages, typeface, and above all the lovely illustrations scattered throughout further commend it. I have bought copies for all 3 of my grown children--because every family deserves to own a complete version of this classic story and this one is the best I have ever seen.
B000803PKY|4.0|There's not much more positive to say about this release that others haven't already said. The sound is crisp, packaging great, the bonus tracks on the DVD-Audio disc are fun to have after all these years. <br /> <br />However, I have one major complaint that I'm surprised no one else mentioned: this remaster edits out the first 29 seconds of the lead-off title track. Why on earth would you do that? For those who know the album those 29 seconds are of a restless crowd waiting for Browne and his band to start the show. On an album whose goal was to give a vivid picture of a musician's life on the road, that intro was a crucial lead-off. I can assume the edit was to make the track more immediate; but it strips the power out of the opening for the sake of pandering to America's increasing short-attention span. <br /> <br />If you can live with that edit, this version of the album is well, well, worth the money.
1563523302|4.0|This book was easy to read, although does not provide the \\"formula\\" for becoming rich.  The statistics that the authors gathered is outstanding.  The authors provide insight into the differences between people who are high spenders and those who are high investors.  Which one are you?  Which method do you think will make you rich?  Basically, I live the way the authors suggest (frugal, but smart), but they tend to make you feel bad if you are not a business owner, laywer or accountant.   <br /> <br />I liked the book's language and the way it almost gives us hope we could all be millionaires one day.  Read it if you think you need a step in the right direction.
B000654Z2I|4.0|A friend told me about this album and I picked it up at Tower Records during their closing sale. What I like about this album are also its faults. I really appreciate the long improvisation and they way they splice tape loops together to make long pieces, but at the same time, their penchant for repeating a phrase over and over again gets a tad annoying. This is definitely not music to snap your fingers to!<br /><br />I find this is the type of music where you need to sit back, maybe turn on the black light, burn some incense, and just take it all in. I listen to most of my music on my long commute to work and somehow the background noises take away from the ambience. But I have to give credit to a bunch of guys that played what they felt, and not what might get them laid, or get them a hit record. To me this is a hit record in a whole different world. Recommended for electronic and improvisational music lovers.
6304522517|5.0|After winning the superbowl dallas did infact bounce back to the playoffs with even more distractions in the 96 season dallas still made to the playoffs although they lost to the panthers but atleast they beat the 49er's at home.
B000005RU2|5.0|This is fun and heavy music.  Ian Gillian screams his head off, Ritchie Blackmore goes nuts with vibrato and tremolo on his Stratocaster, Jon Lord goes into intergalactic space and back with incredible Hammond electronic organ effects, and Roger Glover and Ian Paice somehow hold it all together in Japan.  This is Deep Purple.<br /><br />The music could easily fly over the edge with a lesser group, with such silly material as \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\" (a trite \\"girl I gotta have ya\\" rock song) or \\"The Mule\\" (with some totally bizarre lyrics flying into a drum solo), but Deep Purple somehow transform the fluff into amazing and deep music.  I'd dare any other band out there to try this.<br /><br />The high points are \\"Highway Star\\", which kicks things off with a bang, and \\"Lazy\\" and \\"Space Truckin'\\", which feature Jon Lord's bizarre virtuosity and cutting-edge analog modulation of the classic Hammond organ.  The sound, although strange and definitely \\"70's\\", somehow holds up remarkably well 35 years later.<br /><br />Everyone is in excellent form on the album.  They hold their own and play well together.<br /><br />Very good liner notes provide a glimpse into the concert, the band, and even how this was marketed at the time as the greatest concert ever recorded.  That bold claim is not too far from the truth, even today.  Speaking of recording, the sound is excellent, as it always has been, with excellent balance and clarity.<br /><br />The three encores are an interesting, but not essential, addition.  They're enjoyable, but unfortunately, they turn what could have been 1 CD into 2 CDs, making this more a little more expensive.<br /><br />Overall, this is music that goes way over the top and rarely seems to come back, and it might not be for everyone.  But if you enjoy hard rock and virtuosity, this is an essential purchase.
0812975219|4.0|I was fascinated when I stumbled across Fooled by Randomness recently and decided to give it a shot.  After all, the cover says it was named by Fortune as \\"one of the smartest books of all time\\", so how can you go wrong?<br /><br />I found this to be a somewhat interesting but challenging read.  The author is a former Wall Street quant who has forgotten more about statistics and probabilities than I'll ever know.  As a result, even though the book is written for anyone with a decent knowledge of math it gets rather heavy at times.<br /><br />The author is a big fan of Karl Popper and much of what he offers in this book is based on there being only two types of theories:<br /><br />  1. Those that are known to be wrong, and<br /><br />  2. Those that simply haven't been proven to be wrong yet.<br /><br />In other words, much of the wisdom and supposed business intelligence that is credited for great investment results can often be attributed to nothing more than dumb luck.  In fact, there's no reason to limit this logic to investing.  The author suggests that the same is true for many other business and personal life results.<br /><br />One of his other equally interesting points is in this excerpt:<br /><br />  \\"The higher up the corporate ladder, the higher the compensation to the individual.  This might be justified, as it makes plenty of sense to pay individuals according to their contributions.  However, and in general (provided we exclude risk-bearing entrepreneurs), the higher up the corporate ladder, the lower the evidence of such contribution.\\"<br /><br />Given my title (Vice President and Executive Publisher), reading that paragraph was like getting a punch in the gut.  As I read the rest of that section though, I found myself agreeing with Taleb's argument.  If you're not sure whether the book is a worthwhile investment, take a few minutes and read this part (pages 254-257) and see if you're not convinced as well; it might also cause you to want to buy the book to read more of the author's interesting perspective.<br /><br />If anything, this book makes me feel both a bit more confident and unsure of myself as an investor.  The confidence comes from knowing that many \\"professional\\" investors are really just benefiting from nothing more than lucky choices, the same luck I might enjoy just by playing the game.  The reasons for uncertainty are the same as they always have been...nt to buy the book to read more of the author's interesting perspective. <br /> <br />If anything, this book makes me feel both a bit more confident and unsure of myself as an investor.

B000GFLE1S|4.0|Chiwetel, the same actor whose talent shown in Dirty, Pretty Things, here puts on a wig and full drag in this feel-good British comedy.<br /><br />The story revolves around a man, Charlie Price, who has been given reigns to his father's shoe factory, one that has been handed down for generations.<br /><br />Due to the changing economy, shoe factories everywhere are shutting down. Charlie's relationship with his fiancee begins to go downhill as he is forced to lay workers off and await the inevitable. Until he meets an eccentric dragqueen who inspires Charlie to find a niche market designing boots for drag queens.<br /><br />Apparently this movie is based on actual events and succeeds in entertining and not overdoing itself, though it has its sappy moments.<br /><br />Funny, smart and a phenomanal performance by Ejiofor make this worth seeing.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|This movie is not at all what I expected of Oliver Stone!  It was not political at all, it was VERY well done!  This movie is shot from the point of view of the officers, so they had no idea what was going on.  They were not 100% sure that a second plane hit the tower, they just heard rumors.  They did not know that the towers had collapsed.  This movie shows their will to survive.  It also shows what their families are going through and the uncertainty they were under.  They had no idea if their loved one was alive or deak; all they knew was that they had gone into the towers.<br /><br />This was an awesome movie and not at all what I expected of an Oliver Stone movie.
B000J103PC|4.0|Ok, I know what Prada is...sort of.  I couldn't pick one out of a line up to save my life but I know it's a fashion line...of shoes, or purses or something.  In any case, I watched this film with my wife because it looked entertaining.  I'm a movie buff and Anne Hathaway is not only cute but she's a talented force coming up through the ranks of Hollywood.  After seeing her in Brokeback mountain, I wanted to see what else she was in (besides the Disney Princess flicks). <br />I was not disappointed.  She gives a great performance as Andrea Sachs, a straight forward girl from the mid-west who applies for a position as second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the Satanesque Editor in Chief of Runway, a fashion magazine of Godzilla like proportions.  She aspires to be a journalist, not a fashion editor, so she is shocked to find that it's a dream job for many and that if she can hold out for a year she can work anywhere she wants. <br /> <br />The unfolding of the film's message is subtle, showing how when one gets ahead in the business they thereby loose everything else in their life, arguably including their soul.  As she starts out snubbing the industry, she soon learns she has to integrate herself in order to make it work (when in Rome...).  Things start to fall apart in her personal life though; her friends loose interest, her boyfriend complains she isn't around anymore and they have nothing in common.  This is done without them becoming unreasonable jerks as well. <br /> <br />As for the other performers; Streep runs away with the movie in whatever scene she's in.  Her low key and delicate approach to the character instead of being a high volume demanding taskmaster is brilliant.  Anyone can be a screaming bitch, but Streep puts class in her strut and her dialogue showing why she is one America's premier actresses.  She's a blast to watch but you want to kill her at the same time.   <br /> <br />Other notable performances include Emily Blunt as the first assistant, Simon Baker as the journalist who may help Andy get her foot in the journalism door and most especially Stanley Tucci, brilliantly playing Miranda's right hand man and lead fashion expert. <br /> <br />The movie is very entertaining and a good story that is very relatable to most.  It is thankfully NOT about fashion, or it would have lost me five minutes into the movie.
B000787WVK|5.0|This clearly underrated opera is at last given fair justice in the CD catalogue. For, with this specific recording at this price, one needs no longer hesitate, this is now the top recommendation.  <br /> <br />It's primary strengths are the conducting of Maestro de Fabritiis and the Faust of Pavarotti. de Fabritiis here manages, unlike for example, Serafin and Rudel, to achieve a great sounding whole performance, of a piece in which there is always the risk of just presenting many great sounding numbers/moments in a row. The spaciousness in tempi may not appeal all, but it largely contribute to the feeling of a spirited whole. The only conductor to partially present a threat to de Fabritiis is in my opinion the almost totally unknown Ivan Marinov on a hard to find recording from the Bulgarian State opera on the Capriccio label. Marinovs singers though, are less notable, although the \\"lontano, lontano\\" duet is the best I've ever heard, and the coro of the prologue is just - heavenly. That recording has some flaws though, but at half the price of this, still a good bargain for those on a budget. <br /> <br />Pavarotti, not always one of my favorite tenors, is in glorious voice and presents the true poetry of Faust's character and music. His 'Dai campi', the second act duet with Margerita on believing (or not) in religion, the duet with Elena beginning with \\"Notte cupa, truce\\", and the \\"Giunto sul passo estremo\\" just before the closing of the opera are just a few mentioned highlights of a great performance. Where Domingo (normally my choice before Pavarotti) for Rudel sounds totally uniform and bland, Pavarotti expresses. And where del Monaco for Serafin is rather hard on the border to coarse, Pavarotti is thoughtful. The only tenor to make a portrayal that comes in the class of Pavarotti's is di Stefano, also for Serafin (but only as highlights of the opera).  <br /> <br />Ghiaurov's Devil is rather noble and well-sounding, compared to for example Treigle (Rudel) or Christoff (Gui). Lacking something of pure evil, as you find in Christoff (Gui), Siepi (Serafin) and Ramey (Muti), he still is mightily impressive. Freni is as always, well inside her role and beautiful in voice, which naturally also goes for the luxury casting of Caballe as Elena - Her duet with Pavarotti is especially fine. The rest of the cast is very good, and it's nice to hear Piero de Palma sing the role of Wagner again, as he did 25 years earlier on the Serafin/Siepi/Tebaldi/del Monaco set, still sounding fresh and urgent. <br /> <br />The rivals then? Well, if thinking of this as a showcase for a bass, I must say Siepi (Serafin) and Christoff (Gui) are the best - good fun, and both have darker voices, preferable in a opera such as this. Ramey (Muti) is also good fun, but he's almost the only listenable singer in that set. Ghiaurov is not the first choice devil, nor in timbre, nor in character, but his voice and projection is first class, none the less. <br /> <br />As for the ladies, Freni also has stiff competition, in Tebaldi (Serafin) & Caballé (Rudel) primarily. Her greatest point is in presenting a woman more obviously troubled than both Caballé and Tebaldi - the former almost too sweet, the latter slightly detached though beautiful on the ear. Fans of either of the women will like their special performances. Having all, I slightly prefer Freni. Caballé though, has no match in the catalogue as Elena, with her magically spun tone. <br /> <br />So this set has 3 top of the list performances from it's leads, and the most fluent & sensitive conducting. So, only if the Devil's role is of the greatest importance to you, you might want to look elsewhere, even though you wouldn't go far wrong with Ghiaurov. As for myself, this set is now the one I will come back too for the over-all performance, still keeping the Siepi/Tebaldi/di Stefano/Serafin highlights close to my heart, definately so for the devil.  <br /> <br />Last, for those who pays interest in useless detail - the Decca people, has choosen to give this release of the recording a catalogue number that ends with 666!
B00000295Y|5.0|Cypress Hill's second album, 1993's \\"Black Sunday,\\" is another great album of funny, pro-weed paranoid lyrics from B-Real, Sen Dog and the crew, amazing beats courtesy of DJ Muggs, and just overall original and fun hip hop music. This album is very similar to their debut, \\"Cypress Hill,\\" but the quality of the music is just as good, if not better in many spots, than on their debut. They went with the philosophy of if it ain't broke, don't fix it on \\"Black Sunday,\\" and it works perfectly. On this album you start to see a little bit of the rock influence that they would later explore more in the late 90s, and Muggs steps his production up a little bit while staying with the heavy bass, slow beats, woozy synths, and smoky sampling and instrumentation that made him famous. B-Real and the MCs stay with the same kind of subject matter as on the debut, centering around smoking, humorous recollections of urban violence, and Latino references, but it doesn't sound even slightly redundant. B-Real's nasal rumble and Sen Dog's deep bellows and chants are as awesome as ever. This is the second classic album from the pioneering Los Angeles Cuban rap collective, and I recommend it to all hip hop fans.<br /><br />The album begins with the self-explanatory \\"I Wanna Get High,\\" with its great chorus and verses from all parties. The production is laced with deep, funky bass and a distant sounding siren, showing Muggs's signature style. The upbeat and drum-staticky \\"I Ain't Goin' Out Like That\\" follows, another high point. The next song is maybe the most well-remembered song of early 90s rap, the song that made the group a household name, \\"Insane in the Brain.\\" This song is a classic, boasting a memorable chorus, great production, and funny verses, creating a legendary song that is still so widely recognized today. \\"When the S... Goes Down\\" has a great beat and good chemistry from the MCs. \\"Lick a Shot\\" sounds reminiscent of the late 80s LA hip hop style, but the lyrics make it totally Cypress Hill. \\"Cock the Hammer\\" displays once again the signature weirdness that is B-Real, Sen Dog, and Muggs. The tough \\"3 Lil' Putos\\" preaches tough violence with threatening sounding lyrics. The smoker's anthem \\"Hits From the Bong\\" has a great beat and chorus, as does \\"What Go Around Come Around, Kid.\\" \\"A to the K\\" is funny, and \\"Hand on the Glock\\" follows in similar procession. The album ends with the excellent \\"Break `Em Off Some,\\" an upbeat and funky production. Like on their debut, short songs like \\"Lock Down\\" and \\"Legalize It\\" provide focused, beautiful beats courtesy of the legendary DJ Muggs.<br /><br />Bottomline is that if you liked \\"Cypress Hill,\\" you'll love \\"Black Sunday,\\" because basically it's the same ideas musically and lyrically, just advanced two full years. This album is a consistent classic, and all kinds of rap fans are certain to enjoy it. I could definitely make an argument that this is Cypress Hill's best album, but regardless it is definitely among the finest albums of hip hop's greatest year, 1993, and has stood the test of time, sounding fresh and original even thirteen years later. I think everyone can enjoy \\"Black Sunday\\" and I highly recommend it.y Cypress Hill. \\"Cock the Hammer\\" displays once again the signature weirdness that is B-Real, Sen Dog, and Muggs.

B00000612P|5.0|Once upon a time, Rod Stewart was actually a respected singer. Even more surprising than that is how he once deserved his respect. This disc is the culmination of that, and the best album Stewart ever was involved it, be it solo, with the Faces, or during his sadly overlooked stint with the Jeff Beck Group.<br /><br />As far as classic title tracks go, things don't really get much better than this album's. Six minutes of pure, unadultered rock 'n' roll - while there's not an electric guitar in sight, he rocks with the best of them. And those lyrics... damn, THAT'S how ya play rock 'n' roll: Loud, fun and sleazy. Things mellow out considerably with one of the many covers on this album: the lovely, underrated Seems Like a Long Time. Nobody's gonna beat the King's version of That's All Right anytime soon, but Rod does a spectacular, rockling job here, and the surprise coda (I won't give it away) is bound to catch you completely off-guard. Next up is his cover of Dylan's Tomorrow is a Long Time, and I'd say it's the weakest link. But hey, look at its competition! Still a nice little song, but doesn't compete with the other tunes.<br /><br />Side two has got to be one of the best sides in rock history. First up is Maggie Mae, Rod's signature song. His funny, sly tale of loving an older woman NEVER gets old. Then there's Mandolin Wind, his best ballad; and I'm Losing You, his best rocker. Pure, unadultered chaos. The Temptations did a good version of this song, but this one's so much better... he turns that thing inside-out. And things close up with Reason to Believe, a ragged, good-natured ballad with some of Rod's best vocals.<br /><br />Okay, so Rod's descended into a walking self-parody at this point. But back while he was actually a legitimate artist, he was awesome.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Being shelved, fought over, re-written and passed on by three CEOs, over 20 producers and countless writers, the wait was finally over when Brian Singer decided to take the reins on rebooting the Superman franchise.  The only person to survive the whole process was Jon `former hairstylist to Barbara Streisand-the movie must have a giant spider' Peters, whose heavy handed and outlandish approach to the character was probably one of the main reasons the movie never got made in the 90s.  Look him up, check out Kevin Smith's `An Evening With...' and you'll understand what I mean.  He represents the worst of Hollywood's worst producers who think they know what people want in doing massive re-imaging of classic characters.  He would make remake John Wayne into a Lawyer and Marilyn Monroe into `Barb Wire' if he had his way.  <br /> <br />But I digress.  His name is most likely on this movie simply because he has been involved from the beginning.   Thankfully Brian Singer, who proved his worth with the first two X-Men films, brings high end quality to the film and the story.   <br /> <br />Five years have past since the story of Superman 2 (Superman 3 & 4 thankfully have been graciously and shamelessly ignored/forgotten) and the Man of Steel returns to Earth after searching for remains of his home world.  At his return he find things have moved forward without him.  Not all in a good way either.  He finds the world has changed quite a bit, most due to 9/11 as he flips through channels and sees the news reports.  He also finds that Lois has moved on, having a child and a fiancé.  This lends to a great human element of Superman; did he ever think about how the people of Earth would move on while he was gone?  Did it occur to him that Lois wouldn't wait forever?  The humanistic aspect of this discovery lends to good dramatic elements.  Superman doesn't give up so easily on Lois and she obviously still harbors feelings for him.  Although she's deeply ticked at him for leavingwithout saying goodbye, so she keeps her distance.   <br /> <br />On the other side of the coin, Lex Luthor is released from prison, ironically because of Superman not showing up for the Appeals hearing.  He immediately begins planning his next scheme.  Kevin Spacey is on the money as Lex, giving an efficient performance.  Lex is determined to be the mastermind he is and he doesn't waste time talking about out loud or gloating when he could be furthering his goals.  He is intelligent, vicious and surprisingly likable.  <br /> <br />To further comment on the casting, I have to say I have mixed feeling about Brandon Routh.  Generally I think he's excellent.  He plays both sides of the character as well as Christopher Reeve did.  As Clark Kent his goofy antics to cover suspicion are actually even more subtle and more endearing.  As Superman, he's a little less convincing.  He doesn't have the presence that Christopher Reeve did, but you want so much to believe he is Superman that any doubts you have are just washed away with his likeability.  His Midwestern values ooze from his persona, just like Reeve.  The few doubts I have may be there only because that was the Superman I grew up with.  Newcomers won't make those comparisons.  Even so, no one can deny that Reeve had a greater physical presence and his eyes had a piercing quality that just can't be duplicated.  I was more impressed with Kate Bosworth.  Going in, I knew nothing about her, but once I first saw her on the screen I wasn't impressed.  But as the movie went on, I realized she had the grit and venom spitting down.  She was a tough woman reporter who had been scorned, and despite her finding love again with someone else, the moment Superman shows up, she kicks up the venom spewing a notch.  By the end, you're opinions of her have changed, but she really hasn't.  She (Lois) is still a bit bitchy and not totally over the whole being scorned thing.  However, Kate is a bit young to have gone through everything they talked about AND have a kid AND be as world weary as she is.  These are all just nit picks though, I still enjoyed watching them both.  Routh and Bosworth have good chemistry, which is important considering the chemistry between Reeve and Margot Kidder was so great.    <br /> <br />The plot line is not too far off from the first, but still original.  There is no doubt that so many aspects of the movie are an homage to the Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve films made over twenty five years ago.  Singer throws in just enough of the back story of those films to continue on here.  Composer John Ottman certainly ignores his own pride and integrates the popular John Williams theme into his own score, stitching together the past movies with this one even more. <br /> <br />The action scenes are great in this one although I would have loved to have seen more super-feats (rescues, stopping criminals, etc.), there was an entire montage of those in the first movie and with so many similarities why not do that too.  There is a great shot that is a tribute to Action Comics #1 where he is putting the car on the ground.  Fans will see it.  Overall it was an incredible movie with great heart and soul being used to revive one of the worlds greatest heroes.  Welcome back Superman.
0393061434|5.0|I dont have much time to focus on reading book, which is sad. However I listen to them in my car during commutes. I picked up the unabridged MP3 Audio book from the publisher.  <br /> <br />This book is great. It gets a little technical sometimes, but following the path that led to the creation of the first usable personal computer is fascinating. I wish the book had been twice as long. <br /> <br />if your not into technology this book will probably bore you, however if you are interested in how the computer revolution happened read this.
B00064X5TS|4.0|While I loved the entire series, overall - \\"Reloaded\\" and \\"Revolutions\\" had what, 10 times the budget of the original film - and failed to pack as much of a punch. <br /> <br />\\"Reloaded\\" and \\"Revolutions\\" seemed to spend more time building on all the obscure religious references than actually continuing where the first film left off. <br /> <br />What saddens me the most, in watching these two films, you walk away asking yourself where the budget went?  They had millions and millions of dollars, and other than the highway scene and the sentinel attack scene - I can't think of any other significant scenes that would cost a lot to produce - where did all that money go?

B000G03RJA|5.0|Laura Branigan, a New York singer with a big, beautiful voice and dark sultry looks, tore up the charts in the early to mid 80s with a mix of europop style dance hits and soft rock ballads. Hindered by bad management, a label that though supportive, didn't know exactly what niche to market her to, and personal drama (divorce, drugs, lawsuits), her platinum status days didn't last, and she was all too soon forgotten. A pity, because Branigan was a top notch vocalist, with emotional range, phrasing and delivery that blow away all the screaming \\"divas\\" of today.<br /><br />This Rhino produced compilation of hits and stand-out album tracks is perhaps the best selection of her work to date: it sounds great and offers some interesting song choices besides the chart hits (all here, for the most part). Wisely, the focus seems to be on the earlier years, when the lovely Branigan was at her peak. The inclusion of Satisfaction (a single in Germany) is a nice touch, although I'm puzzled by the omission of Maybe Tonight (a UK and Germany single which even has a video).  A fine collection at any rate, and perhaps we'll even see the complete Self Control album remastered by Rhino with bonus tracks!
B0006GAOBI|3.0|Man, that Jake Gyllenhaal gets around. He got Emmy Rossum in The Day After Tomorrow (2004). He got Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain (2005). And he gets Jena Malone in Donnie darko.<br /><br />The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is a 2+ hour episode of The Twilight Zone. It deals in time travel, the butterfly effect, and the whole \\"what would happen if certain events in the past didn't happen or were changed\\" thing.<br /><br />And apparently the formula works. At the time of this writing the average Amazon rating is 4+ stars with almost 1000 reviews to back it up. Wow.<br /><br />Well, I say, what we have here is a good movie with a loyal following. Hence, Donnie Darko, for whatever reason, has become somewhat of a Cult Classic. But a 5 star film??? No. You have GOT to have Rabbititis to think that THIS is a 5 star film.<br /><br />Donnie Darko is an interesting movie. Its Director Richard Kelly has a very short resume, so kudos to him for creating such a buzz around such a mediocre psychological adventure.<br /><br />A lot of the situations are real and fun to watch. But the time travel part is the real point of the movie, which is bizarre and not easy to follow even if you are paying attention.<br /><br />So, if after all that you are as I was inclined to give Donnie Darko a try based on the raves...rent it as I did. Then perhaps make the purchase if the movie compels you to join the group that makes this film a classic...a \\"Cult\\" Classic.
B00004SC3M|3.0|`Entrapment' is one fun film filled with gadgets and plot twists that are sure to keep the viewer glued to the screen, not to mention Catherine Zeta-Jones in one of her most flattering roles.  In this crime thriller Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Virginia Baker, an insurance investigator who is hot on the tail of Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery), a thought to be retired art thief.  As the story would go Virginia is somewhat of an art thief herself and enlists MacDougal's help in carrying out her master plan of stealing boatloads of money through wireless transfers on New Years Eve.  Sure the chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Connery is a bit of a stretch, but Connery is always suave and Zeta-Jones is as beautiful and intoxicating as ever before, and lets not forget Ving Rhames' `so-bad-he's-so-cool' Aaron Thibadeaux.  Plus, there's a twist I never saw coming that makes up for any generic formalities and lack of believable love interest.  I surely enjoyed this film and an pretty sure the lot of you will too!

0440180295|4.0|Admittedly I'm not a fan of sci-fi but this book caught my eye in a used book store. It is completely different from anything else I've read before or since. Vonnegut is truly a master writer. It has been said a great book will reach out from the pages and grab you. A perfect description for this book.
B000J103PC|4.0|Chick-book writer Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel comes to fast-paced life in the 2006 film adaptation of The Devil Wears Prada....Rest assured, a movie that is no chick-flick. While some of the fast-paced-ness seems over the top, as a veteran that's worked in the publishing business in NYC, I can say first hand that it is not over the top...for the most part.<br /><br />And the completely obtuse disposition that defines Meryl Streep's character, while perhaps a bit exaggerated at times, is universally known in the industry as the standard by which you should set your expectations for a boss if you are going to work at any of the big firms that publish the fat fashion and beauty magazines. I'd bet that Weisberger, quite contrary to the disclaimer that \\"this book/movie is a work of fiction\\", was loosely (or not so loosely) based on a real publisher.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue and situations do indeed stretch the limits of reality, but no more than that of the humorous bits commonly found in shows like HBO's Sex and the City or Entourage. And no wonder...Director David Frankel has made his mark on both of those as a director.<br /><br />Overall, I was completely entertained. I don't know if it's the title using the word \\"Prada\\" or if it's some whisper down the line miscommunication that's incorrectly given The Devil Wears Prada the official chick-flick label among the guy community...perhaps cheating this movie out of a much higher dollar gross.<br /><br />Maybe it's a guy mentality thing? Yesterday I told my buddy about how much I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada. I told him it's a good story; it moves quickly; you can relate to the situations; and the acting is excellent. He said, \\"Does Anne Hathaway get naked?\\" Um...no. It's just a very good movie.<br /><br />So my recommendation, guys, see it. But if you were one of the naysayers, be warned: You will need to go back to everyone and confess that you got your butt kicked by a chick-flick.br />
B00005JL78|5.0|One of the smartest movies to come out in 2002, `Minority Report' is a film that dazzles and frazzles me every time I sit down to watch it.  As many of my friends know, I am not a fan of Tom Cruise.  I think he's a highly overrated actor who receives far too much attention and praise for his own good, but I've always said that he knows how to pick a movie.  A lot of my favorite films (`Eyes Wide Shut', `Minority Report', `Vanilla Sky' & any of the `Mission Impossible' films just to mention a few) are Tom Cruise Vehicles.  This film is no exception, but here Tom is far outweighed by the strength of his co-stars Samantha Morton and the new kid on the block Colin Farrell. <br /> <br />The premise takes place in the not so distant future of 2054 when crime is all but non-existent because of a new `precrime' division of local law.  This division is spearheaded by John Anderton (Cruise), a man haunted by the disappearance of his son six years prior and is now determined to make sure nothing like that ever happens again.  Relying on the premonitions of three `pre-cogs' (three children born to drug addicts who suffer from a horrible gift enabling them to see murders before they actually happen), this team has been able to all but eradicate murder as a whole. <br /> <br />Just as the morals and accuracy of the project are brought into question by Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) it appears the pre-cogs predict that John himself is to murder a man he's never met.  This catapults John into a game of cat and mouse as he tries to prove his innocence while uncovering a strange murder that pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton) keeps seeing over and over.   <br /> <br />Steven Spielberg's direction here is fantastic.  Visually this movie is stunning from start to finish, and plot-wise this is a film that will keep you intrigued and involved.  Samantha Morton is stunning as usual, completely stealing every scene she's in and becoming her character mind, body and soul.  Colin Farrell makes afine breakout here, stealing scene after scene from Cruise and proving to be the more charismatic and entertaining actor of the two.  Max von Sydow also pulls out a nice little performance as the ambiguous Lamar Burgess, mentor to the now troubled John.  It was also nice to see Kathryn Morris (of `Cold Case' fame) here as Lara, John's ex-wife.  It's not that Tom is awful here, he actually pulls out a nice performance, but he's easily overshadowed by the finer actors (Morton in particular who dominates everyone of her scenes) and just continues to shock me with his constant undue praise. <br /> <br />Overall `Minority Report' is one of the best films of 2002, visually, intellectually and entertaining-wise.  It's a complete joyride from start to finish despite Tom and is well worth multiple viewings.
B00007KWHP|5.0|This 1972 album showed Yes starting to move even further into the realm of progressive rock and features the classic lineup of Chris Squire (Rickenbacker bass, vocals); Rick Wakeman (Synthesizers, mellotron, Hammond organ, piano); Steve Howe (acoustic and electric guitars, vocals); Bill Bruford (drums; percussion); and Jon Anderson (lead vocals; guitar).  I think it goes without saying that this lineup would produce some of the finest material released by Yes and was comprised of virtuosos.  Certainly, all of this is very much present on Fragile, which I personally consider a showcase of staggering instrumental skill that is very warm and inviting somehow.<br /><br />Because of contractual problems largely stemming from Rick Wakeman, Fragile consists of three band compositions and several smaller solo pieces.  The three band compositions are excellent and include the alternately ripping and melodramatic Heart of the Sunrise (their response to 21st Century Schizoid Man (King Crimson, 1969); South Side of the Sky (about a failed mission to Antarctica I think); and the classic piece Roundabout.  The solo pieces vary in quality and include the excellent Long Distance Runaround/The Fish (Jon wrote Long Distance Runaround, while The Fish is a Squire tour de force on the electric bass with percussion by Bill); Rick Wakeman's Cans and Brahms (extracts from Brahms's 4th Symphony in E Minor Third Movement performed on an arsenal of synthesizers) (Rick did not like Cans and Brahms at all); Steve Howe's excellent acoustic solo piece Mood for a Day; Bill Bruford's painfully short and unfinished sounding instrumental piece Five Percent for Nothing (a slam on the band manager apparently); and finally,  Jon Anderson's We Have Heaven.  As a bassist and avid worshipper of Squire, The Fish is hands down my favorite, although I generally like all of the solo pieces.<br /><br />Overall, the music on Fragile is simply amazing and has all of the emotional punch (some might say melodrama) of tracks like Survival (1969); and Starship Trooper (1971), yet with the instrumental sophistication that would mark all of the 1970s work.  Some very melodramatic moments can be heard on Heart of Sunrise, which is an absolutely super 10'34\\"; and South Side of the Sky is certainly not without drama.  However, what really got me when I first listened to this album over 25 years ago (and to this very day) is the playing - these guys were in a class by themselves when it came to sheer virtuosity.  Although the playing can get overwhelming at times, it is nicely leavened by softer, acoustic passages (on guitar and piano) and Jon Anderson's high pitched vocals.  Along with some unbelievable vocal harmonies, this makes for one amazing listening experience.<br /><br />With respect to the cover art (the first with Roger Dean), I feel that the painting of the tiny and \\"fragile\\" world on the front cover is very warm and intimate despite the planet being surrounded by the cold vacuum of outer space.  Of course, on the back cover this peaceful world is depicted as breaking up - a very different scene from the front cover.  The neat thing is that the breaking up of the planet was reiterated on the live Yessongs album.  As I recall, I used to stare at the \\"large\\" cover art on the Fragile LP and it was very much a part of the listening experience.  Then again, the cover art was very important for me on all of the Yes albums (even Drama (1980)) and is something I feel compelled to mention when I review any of their works.<br /><br />The remastering on this album is incredible and (sort of) takes me back to the vinyl days. The booklet is excellent and features the original album artwork; a ton of liner notes; and photos of the band.  Although the liner notes are pretty much old hat for the typical Yes freak (such as myself), they should prove informative to lots of folks.  The excellent bonus track America was a very nice addition that was originally recorded for the 1972 Atlanticsampler LP \\"Age of Atlantic\\".  Although I did not own this LP, I did own the compilation album \\"Yesterdays\\", which also featured America.  The other bonus track includes an early rough mix of Roundabout that really does not add much.<br /><br />All in all, an incredible Yes album that is very highly recommended along with all of their works from 1971 -1977.\\".

B0000029DD|4.0|This is a cd that can be played over and over. Jeff Buckley's voice is amazing. The songs may be recognizable from a few tv soundtracks but the complete cd is worth purchasing. Amazing from start to finish. Besides, Last Goodbye is the ultimate break up song.
0895260131|5.0|This book contains, in concise and readable form, everything you should already know about Islam.  It is a tragedy that we in the West have failed to grasp the aggressive historical agenda of this \\"Religion of Peace\\", and a further tragedy that an author who tells the truth about this agenda, as Robert Spencer does, is forced to lable his own words as \\"politically incorrect.\\" <br /> <br />Spencer's work is a thorough and engaging analysis of the personalities, doctrine and historical impact of Islam, supported by systematic documentation including extensive quotes from primary sources.  It is written in a respectful and scholarly manner, kept lively by sidebars that highlight the most crucial points. And it balances in a compelling way the directives of Allah as reported in the Koran, the words and actions of Muhammad, and the historical and contemporary words and actions of the Prophet's followers.  Of the several works on Muhammad and Islam I have recently read, this one is by far the best.  While the author makes no secret of his agenda--he sees Islam as a serious threat to western civilization--he makes no assertions which he cannot support.  And unlike some critics who have reviewed this book, he does not appear to be driven by any self-interested or dogma based agenda, but simply by his devotion to historical and political truth. <br /> <br />If you are concerned about racism, the threat of war, the abuse of women, or any of the current social issues that draw so much empty lip service, this guide to Islam is a must read.  Out of it you will draw a comprehensive understanding of the doctrine, the practice, and the essential politics and geopolitical agenda of Islam. On the other hand, if you are intimidated by fashionable taboos and addicted to the comfort of ignorance, then reading this volume may require more courage than you can muster.  Suck it up!  The future of your country and of your children is worth a little risk!
B000JJRIN4|4.0|Now I'm not the usual pop-rock fan because I'm more of a hip hop fan, but now and then there are a couple pop and/or rock artists that i like, and No Doubt was one of them. Especially when Gwen went out on her own, I loved LAMB. This album, I feel the same way. Maybe its because she also ventured out towards hip hop (such as Swizz Beats and Neptunes). I love this CD, and even though these songs were sort of rejects from LAMB, I don't give a f**k. This cd is good. All of ya'll who are mad cuz she uses a lot of hip hop, mayne stop hating. Hip hop is just as good, and how she uses it helps her. The only thing though is trying to top the charts cuz right now Fergie is winning on that end. So Gwen needs to step up!
B00002SSKI|5.0|This story is almost exactly how I was when I was a bit younger.  It's good to look back on old times.. <br /> <br />Great acting and storyline.  If you're a fan of chick flicks, or even feel good movies, then you have to see this!
B000JLTRJ0|4.0|There will alway be discussions of whether or not it's a proper time to show a real disaster in media most known for fiction.  Whether we admit it or not, there are fears that the event will be trivialized.  Worse yet, we're always afraid of the emotions that come along with such treatments and compare the works with how we remember the real event. <br /> <br />When I heard that Oliver Stone was directing a \\"big-view\\" story of 9/11 seen through the eyes of two real survivors and the people of New York, I was more than a little afraid.  I was, in fact, terrified.  Take nothing away from Stone in his successes - he's a great storyteller and can deliver powerful emotional stories - but we also know he has a tendancy to demonstrate his contempt and suspicion of goverment, as well as the habit of belaboring points to death.  I remember Denis Leary once making the comment in \\"No Cure For Cancer\\" about his take on \\"The Doors\\" - \\"do we need a three-hour movie on Jim Morrison?\\"  He was right - we didn't. <br /> <br />But here was the surprise - Stone did this tale well. <br /> <br />It's a story rich in detail and filled with real-life heroes.  Nic Cage leads the rest of a stellar cast to bring a painfully personal account of survival in a context of a nation under attack.  New York, as well as Washington, Pennsylvania, even my own Boston, were different places before the attacks, and through Stone's attention to detail, we see the day it all happened with crystal clarity.  \\"World Trade Center\\" reminded me of how it was before and how much we have changed as a people.  Mostly because we see that day as it was.  We were spectators, true, but we were living it, praying in it, watching the ruins of the Towers with a desperate hope for happy news while getting precious little of it.  The survial of two heroic New York City cops, trapped beneath the rubble of a symbol, gave us some when we needed it the most. <br /> <br />\\"World Trade Center\\" isn't an easy film to watch preciselybecause it kicks up old emotions.  Thus, it will NOT be to everyone's taste, and it will leave some empty.  Yet, when we hold it up to \\"United 93,\\" another gripping account of that day from a very different perspective, we see what we need to see - a nation attacked, a people wounded to the core, the spirit to carry on, and a people (despite its government - sorry, had to say it) willing to do what had to be done in order to bring some goodness out of horror.
B00005JPGM|5.0|Blood Diamond has some of the finest performances I have seen.  It is a telling comment when an actor makes you forget that you are watching Leonardo DiCaprio or Djimon Hounsou and convinces you that you are watching an unscrupulous smuggler and a fisherman.  Probably the overwhelming number of films that I have seen will have a scene that stretches the truth, something less than credible that makes the story exciting but is beyond the realm of certainty.  Blood Diamond, on the other hand, comes over like a piece of good journalism and you feel as if you are watching events as they unfolded.  <br /> <br />The story of the film has been nicely summarized by other reviewers.  It is, indeed, a story that has several layers one of them being the misery of modern Africa with its unstable governments and extreme poverty.  We see the immense piles of garbage that are the playgrounds for children and the enslavement of children by militias that turn them into child soldiers who are devoid of the simple delights of being children.  Greed is the overriding motive for Danny Archer, Solomon Vandy and Colonel Coetzee and Captain Poison.  Archer sees the diamond as his ticket out of Africa and Arnold Vosloo (and Captain Poison as well) for its fabulous wealth.  The sympathetic choice is Solomon because he not only found the stone (made a slave by the rebels and forced to pan for diamonds) but he would make a better life for his impoverished family.  On the other side of the diamond trade is journalist Maddy Bowen (played by Jennifer Connelly) who wants to expose the misery that Africans are forced to endure searching for diamonds and the cartel turns a blind eye toward.  She begins a relationship with Archer and appears to slowly change his feelings toward the diamond corporation he smuggles for from one of complicity to a willingness to let her expose them.        <br /> <br />Director Edward Zwick (who also directed Glory and The Last Samurai) has produced another masterpiece of story telling.  The final scene is unforgettable as Solomon (the best performance I have seen Djimon Hounsou give), now reunited with his family in London, is about to tell his story before a commission investigating the diamond trade.  The film also makes a plea to us, the people who buy diamonds, to become responsible for discovering where the stone came from and if it could be a smuggled diamond.  This film will probably make you see diamonds in a new light and remind us that we can play a part to end the misery of how these gems are mined.     <br />
034544678X|4.0|Patricia McConnell has written a clear and thought provoking book on ANIMAL behavior. Take note, McConnell does not stop with dog behavior, but looks closely at primate behavior as well. It is important to know not only how to speak dog, but why our behavior, while understandable by us and other primates, communicates in a foreign language to our dogs. For example, did you know that every time you grab a dog by the face and press your face up to the dog that you are probably making that dog quite uncomfortable? Dogs do not greet each other face to face - it is an aggressive behavior and your dog will notice when you stop staring him in the eye (basically saying \\"you wanna fight!\\") and start kissing her on the cheek! McConnell's writing is fluid and clear. However, I find sections overly pendantic at times and I would highly recommend further sections on practical, hands on things we can do to help correct problem behavior. This is important to note. This book is not really a training book - there is not even a single paragraph on leash pulling. While it has helpful training tips and advice, it is mostly a book about psychology and communication. For functional training methods, pick up another of McConnell's training books (or perhaps those of another well qualified trainer). But if you want to better understand what your dog's behavior communicates and how you can change your behavior to better communicate with your dog, this is by far the best and most accesible book on the subject. Learn the importance of tone of voice, length of sound, repetition, body language, facial expression and the often misunderstood concepts of dominance and leadership. After reading McConnell, you and your dog will finally be speaking the same \\"body\\" language! I highly recommend this interesting book.
0803726570|5.0|I purchased this book when my daughter was 3 years old and she enjoyed it so much that I read it to her PK4 class.  Thereafter, every time I showed up to read a story, the kids would start to chant \\"Room on the Broom. Room on the Broom\\".  I would read the book of the day and then read Room on the Broom. I never said no because I love the story as well.  Eventually they knew the key parts of the book and we would receite them together.  My daughter is now 6 and reads on her own, but we still read this book together and sing....\\"Down!!! cried the witch....And whoosh they were gone.....!!! (And I am at work writing this) This is one of the best children's books ever written. It is a must have for every child.  Five stars Julia!!!!
B000HCO8IQ|1.0|Like most songs here in Europe, the single 'dont feel like dancin' mysteriously came out almost simultaneously on ALL radio stations. The song has since been played relentlessly non-stop 24-7 on all stations. Even if a song I liked was playing, I'd certainly get sick of hearing it so much. Didn't need to wait that long to get sick of this one though. At the first sign of the manufactured falsetto vocal, my skin cringed. The bridge to the song is a blood curdling synthesizer that pierces one's ears like a chain saw - a truly horrid tone. It's like the totally annoying whine of an infant at 4:00am - impossible to ignore. The 'music', if you can call it that, must have listeners attention, though it offers nothing. Brings no heart to the table. I can usually tune stuff like that out but this is appaling.     There is absolultely no orinality whatsoever. Beegees with no smooth. Great marketing though(hence the 1 star). Five years from now you'll never admit to your friends that you bought it.
0446691437|5.0|My addiction to learning is fueled by those once-a-year books I pick up that literally change the way I perceive things and influence me to think and act differently. The Art of War, by Steven Pressfield, is that book for this year. I read the (short) book over the last few days, then re-read the first half of it again today (I guess I didn't want it to end). <br />This is a book that slams you up 'side the head with its blunt yet beautiful personification of Resistance (the malevolent force of nature that intentionally diverts the \\"artist\\" from sitting down and doing her work) and its description of the differences between a \\"professional\\" (someone who stomps on Resistance daily, in order to get work done) and an \\"amateur\\" (with whom Resistance has its own way). The final section discusses the \\"angels and muses\\" who use you and me as vessels for our art - if we'll just get out of our own way, sit down, and begin. <br /> <br />The quality of the book that gives its ideas such power is its depiction of Resistance as an evil force that owns us - unless we become aware of its pernicious influence and take steps every day, every hour - whenever it creeps up on us - to actively combat Resistance. Here are some key excerpts from the first section that defines the enemy of Resistance: <br /> <br />\\"Are you a writer who doesn't write, a painter who doesn't paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what Resistance is.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work....It will reason with you like a lawyer or jam a nine-millimeter in your face like a stickup man.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Resistance's goal is not to wound or disable. Resistance aims to kill. Its target is the epicenter of our being: our genius, our soul, the unique and priceless gift we were put on earth to give and that no one else has but us. Resistance means business. When we fight it, we are in a war to the death.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Rationalization is Resistance'sspin doctor.... Resistance presents us with a series of plausible, rational justifications for why we shouldn't do our work.... What Resistance leaves out, of course, is that none of this means diddly. Tolstoy had thirteen kids and wrote War and Peace. Lance Armstrong had cancer and won the Tour de France three years and counting.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Resistance seems to come from outside ourselves. We locate it in spouses, jobs, bosses, kids.... Resistance is not a peripheral opponent. Resistance arises from within. It is self-generated and self-perpetuated. Resistance is the enemy within.\\" <br /> <br />Already, since reading The War of Art, I have become much more tuned in to those moments when Resistance is trying to press its claws into me. And perhaps because I have learned to identify Resistance in all its chameleon, sneaky forms, I'm really enjoying kicking its butt. It's been four straight days of running now, despite all the (true and real) rationalizations you could possibly imagine. Even writing this blog post is a victory over Resistance. Feels good to block the slam dunk of Resistance for one day. The war begins anew tomorrow morning, 5:00am. Bring it on.
0345360338|5.0|This one actually took me awhile to read because there were parts where I had to keep putting it down because they were so emotional.<br /><br />I love how SKP did this sequel.  She didn't try to drag out the the story of Llewelyn and Joanna, but instead went to the next generation.  This one dealt a little bit with Llewelyn successors, but most of it was about a frenchman who tried to help england's people (simon de montfort).  Llewelyn did ally with him since neither of them were huge fans of King Henry or Prince Edward.<br /><br />A short summary without giving too much away:<br /><br />A bunch of people die (including Llewelyn), Wales is in chaos because there are too many people who want to rule.  Then more people die, some are captured and Llewelyn's grandson Llelo (who then wants to be called Llewelyn, just to confuse things) is in charge.<br /><br />Llewelyn ap Gruffydd has problems with his father and brothers, but all the issues pretty much resolve themselves, except with his younger brother Davydd.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Simon de Montfort is trying to get some changes in the english gov't (trying to get it more representative by getting the king to approve the Oxford Provisions, and obviously king henry's not a fan of this).  He marries the king's sister, Nell.  They get on Henry's bad side right away and he ends up really hating them.  Henry is pretty much a useless king, so his son Edward steps in and takes unoffical control.  There are a couple great battles, and in the end, through some very unfortunate circumstances, things don't go Simon's way, and once again we all end up mad at England.<br /><br />It's a really great book!  I got it from the library, but then went and bought it because I know i'll read it again.  Definately recommend it, but definately read \\"Here be Dragons\\" first.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|Want your jeans/soft drink commercial to appear \\"cool\\"? Just pick a track from this \\"indie-rock-music-by-numbers\\" album!<br /><br />I have heard this album at work a zillion times. It irritated me at first, then it bored me and now I hope I never hear it again.<br /><br />Yes, this is rock music eating itself / rock music as a cover version of itself / rock music as an extension of corporate rock culture.<br /><br />Verdict? Tedious, dull and predictable.
1594200823|5.0|I bought this book after hearing an interview with the author on NPR. I am so delighted that I did; since then, I have purchased three more copies for Christmas presents. Every time I try to describe what this book favors, I fail to be able to summarize it. Pro-organic? Pro-small farm? Anti-fast food? The author touches on all of these, but is sufficiently objective to leave you thinking about everything that you eat, the reasons that you eat it, and the costs that what you eat imposes on society.<br /><br />Along with The World is Flat, The Omnivore's Dilemma is one of the most influential books that I have read this year. I heartily recommend it, and while professionals in nutrition may have nits to pick, the rest of us can enjoy the excellent writing style and the message contained within.
B00005JPCA|3.0|The most interesting part of the movie is the athletic chase at the beginning. However anyone who has climbed around a construction site knows that this kind of athletics around a construction site would lead to either sudden death or serious injury. It was Olympic class action. <br /> <br />The rest of the movie would have been better without the gratuitous violence. In real life intelligence types operate quietly and efficiently. <br /> <br />I rate this 3 stars because of the excessive violence.
0689865384|5.0|Flash three hundred years into the future where mankind has been propelled into a chilling dystopian vision. In one act of terrorism, an engineered petroleum bacterium has brought the world to a standstill. Free thought, free will, industry, culture, diversity and imagination have now become things of the past.<br /><br />In its place resting on the ashes of the 21st century and all it encompassed, is a world shaped by scalpel. This is the world that Tally Youngblood unknowingly lives in. As a fifteen year old \\"Ugly\\", Tally looks forward to her 16th birthday. That is when she will be whisked off to complete her transformation from an \\"Ugly\\" to a \\"Pretty\\"-where beauty's specifications are cunningly determined by the Pretty Committee.<br /><br />But what she doesn't know it's that that not only her body will be changed, but her mind. Just mere weeks before her operation date, she meets Shay, another Ugly in the dorm. Shay seems to know of a world that operates outside of Uglyville and New Pretty Town-a mysterious backwoods utopia known as The Smoke-where the government can't get at you. But getting there might end up costing too much. And what Tally and Shay don't know is that the government will do anything to crush The Smoke and its rebellion. Including using her and Shay to their own ends.<br /><br />Westerfeld knows the intricacies of humanity's foibles and he exploits them in his terrifying vision of the future, where everyone looks alike, acts alike, thinks alike, and only a select few are chosen to think freely. The human race is depicted as operating with such diminished capacity that readers will cringe, and Westerfeld manages to encapsulate the conflict and pressures of superficiality that plagues society today. What could be scarier: A future where the government controls your actions or where they actually tamper with your mind? The Uglies Trilogy is an inventive and captivating YA series, reminiscent of Stephens' The Big Empty, and Orwell's 1984 with a little bit of Logan's Run thrown in.Copyright(c)Nicola Mattosthrown in.Copyright(c)Nicola Mattos
B0000549B0|5.0|I may be going left field with this but I watched this movie just last night and I thought to myself this is a great training movie for sales reps or Multi Level Marketers. And the reason for this is because it indirectly teaches one how to genuinely be a relater. If you ever read \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" by Dale Carnegie, many of the principles in that book is in this movie. Consistent smiling, being courteous, asking about that person's friends and family and numerous other key things. The movie is great to watch anytime and to learn life's lessons.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|I am very overwhelmed and speechless after watching this movie. It takes every civil rights movement and rolls it all into one. This movie takes a very serious look at the way violence is portrayed in modern society and how it is reported to society as well. There are a few things that do stick out in my mind. One of them is \\"We should not be afraid of government, they should be afraid of us\\" and look at the last election what we did as a nation to change what is effecting us. Another thing that sticks out in my mind is history and the definition of \\"terrorists\\". Are the \\"terrorists\\" coming from an outside source? Or are they coming from within our own country? Are the \\"terrorists' acts\\" planned from our own country from people that we should trust? Or maybe we shouldn't have trusted them in the first place. If you look at history of the world from the witch hunts to Nazi Germany to modern day government, it is all \\"controlled and guided\\" by religious zealots trying to \\"save society\\" or \\"save the children\\". We should wake up as a \\"world\\" and save ourselves from them. I am with V in this one; everyone should have the ability to live in peace for whom and what they are. Not be controlled by government guided by religious zealots in how you should be or who you ought to be. Until then, there will be no peace. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!!!
B00005JOLI|4.0|If you are a fan of the books you will no doubt notice some differnces. Some of these differnces I agree with, some I disagree. And some were just dumb. The change of Ugrals to men was probley to make a bigger differnce from LOTR so pepole wouldn't think it a complete copy (it still is somewhat of a compy of LOTR though). However, if you haven't read the books then you are sure to have a fun time watching this; its no LOTR, but it's still a great movie you're sure to enjoy. <br /> <br />P.S. Jermy Irons did an AMAZING job as Brom; Ed Splees, was great as well. the special effects were sweet (Sapheri(dragon), Durza etc.) <br /> <br />Recommended  <br /> <br />PP.SS. It should be rated PG-13 <br />Mikey Lamb 14
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This movie is bound to be a holiday classic!!! I was totally blown away watching this movie. It is a very simple but also a complex movie with only one message and that is \\"believe\\". If you believe in something strong enough, you will get what you want. You can't get anything in life if you don't believe in what you want, so \\"believe\\". Not knowing anything about this movie before I watched it except that it is a christmas movie, I was totally suprised that it didn't have this \\"religious\\" statement attached to it. I commend the author and director of this movie for that \\"freedom\\". I highly recommend this movie to everyone that wants to watch a very moving movie.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Why...why..why? I am a big fan of music, and artist trying out new things, but to put it very simple this album is horrible. I agree with others...her 1st solo album was suprisingly good. Gwen hurry up and finish the No Doubt album, so I can forget you ever released this fisher price album. If this is talent, then i'm sorry music fans...not only should Nas album be called \\"hip hop is dead\\" but Gwen shoulda called this album \\"Music is Dead\\" She is following the same path as her husband...anyone ever hear his solo...nope...that what I thought...
B000BT97AO|5.0|I must say I wasn't sure what I was in for when I rented this movie, it started out a little slow and wasn't sure where it was going, then BAM! it was a daydream through the rest, it is laid out so well even the choice of music they chose is incredible, some ole classics brought to life again, it's awesome. <br /> <br />All in all the movie blew me away, Mystical, Magical, an absolute break from any reality you can think of. <br />I recomend it to anyone that is a lover of mystical work.  <br /> <br />Thanks <br />=S=
B00005JOLI|1.0|It should be FORBIDDEN to release such a BAD movie...  Poorly written, boring, a waste of time and money. I WASTED about 2 hours of my life in this absolutely idiotic movie... It is a bad take-off on Lord of the Rings... even the bad guys look like the bad guys in Lord of the Rings... The story is totally ridiculous, including a dragon who suddenly \\"thinks\\" in perfect English... with the voice of a girl.  All the characters and the story itself are totally unbelievable.   <br /> <br />The acting is horrible... the story is worse... Things happen with no explanation... The hero's brother disappears at the beginning, and at the end a new character enters the story... It is without a doubt THE WORST movie I have seen in 2006...
B00008NRL8|5.0|This is a hard one to explain, I fell in love with this album right away, it's culture behind it, the classic tango sound, blended with a electronica/trip hop-ish style kicked into classic rhythmic move your hips flow. <br /> <br />I personally love this album and know that if you have a taste for tango, or even trip hop/electronica, this will probably please the hard to please. <br /> <br />just good music. <br />=S=
B000JCETC4|4.0|I just received this mini dvd, all is great except the RAH track \\"TAKE A BREATH \\" . I dt talk about the song itself, it's a great track, but the way it is edited, ... The editing is too much fast.. Changement of cameras each seconds, too many lights and flashes etc... i watched the track and i had a headache very fastly ,before the end of the song... To compare, for exemple, Pulse : the guitar is clear, the musicians etc... of course there are effects too, but all is very clear. Here there are too many disturbing effects, too much smoke on the scene, the light is too white very often, impossible too watch the TV too long time... The last minute of the track look like a MTV crazy clip, impossible to recognize nothing .I am very desapointed and i am afraid about the new dvd that must come in february... if all is filmed and edited like this, it will be a mess....
B000G759LW|5.0|I lost the use of my legs when I was 17. The doctors said I would be able to walk again, but I didn't really feel like trying. Besides, I liked people doing stuff for me.  <br /> <br />But then I heard Christina Aguilera's Back To Basics. When 'Candyman' came on, even though my moms and her current boyfriend (he ain't no good for her, but whatever) were in the room, I had to get up out my wheelbarrow (I'm poor-can't afford a wheelchair) and DANCE. This was the first time I'd used my legs in 2 years. I just couldn't resist.  <br /> <br />The music on this album not only cures fake paralysis, but it's also great music! What more could you ask for? (Well, if you're homelss, or in Africa or something I guess you could ask for food, but the booklet is pretty thick---you could eat that I guess.)
B000002LGA|5.0|Wow!  I still remember the first time I heard this one all the way thru when I worked at Cheapos on Snelling back in early '89.  What a treat to hear Lou Reed create such a wonderfully visual, sarcastic, biting, brilliant piece of art after so many years of coming up short on every release.  He has never again been this incredible.  But, I'm still waiting, because I know he'll do it again one of these years...possibly when we least expect it.
0743289412|4.0|Stephen King has always been great at developing large casts of characters that are fully distinct and original. But King rarely writes stories that are centered on a single character. Dolores Claiborne did it with great success, so did Misery. Now Lisey's Story can be added to this list. <br /> <br />This novel almost seems autobiographical. The story is about a woman who has lost her famous novelist husband two years ago. She still has not dealt with the pain of the loss, all the while having to deal with her sister's catatonic state. One day, a man shows up at her house, telling her that she needs to donate all of her husband's unpublished writings to a certain University or bad things will come her way. This twist of events causes her to jump back into a world or memories and sadness. <br /> <br />There are many things she had forgotten about her husband, most particularly, that strange world of his. Scott was able to teleport himself into a world of his own making, a world that has highly influenced  every important moment of his life. As she remembers her husband and her past, she also remembers the strangeness and the violence that accompanies both their stories. <br /> <br />Lisey's Story is a quiet King story. There isn't a great deal of blood, nor is there a great deal of horrific events. But the suspense is always there, always building. Lisey is a great compelling character. She is a strong, no-nonsense woman that is lost in a world that isn't of her own making. She is a woman who has always been there for everyone else but who rarely finds comfort in others. <br /> <br />King always creates strong female Characters. Lisey might be his strongest yet. Emotions and nostalgia drench the pages when she mournfully remembers her husband. And her rage comes right out of the book when she meets the man who threatens her life and her husband's memory.  <br /> <br />Lisey's Story might be slow moving at times, and more emotional than what we're used to for a Kingnovel. But it is still genuine King. Great charcters, great plot, imaginative and always suspenseful. What more can you ask for?
B00003CX5P|5.0|This is just an installment in the series. Far too many people have lambasted this movie because it didn't meet their exaggerated expectations. Put into context, I think it was great, and a neccessity to introduce many different characters. There were great moments where Anakin and Obi-wan meet for the first time, and in the end when Palpatine refers to Anakin after helping defeat the droid army as \\"young Skywalker\\" in the same voice and intonation as is heard in Return of the Jedi as he speaks to Luke. Yes its not exactly the best of the series, but a must have for any fan. OK... we could have all done without the moronic Jar-jar in the same way we could have done with the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi
B000002UC5|5.0|Jeez, I feel like it's the 70's again; defending McCartney:  To anyone who doesn't get it: his solo work is not the Beatles. He never seemed to care as much about lyrics and \\"meaning\\", as opposed to John and George, but focused on great melody, harmony, and catchy, if sometimes almost meaningless, lyrics. No one seemed to mind when he did it with The Beatles......... All amazing. This album may be his best; simple songs, simply recorded, heartfelt. His tunes and lyrics can be deceptively simple ( Junk, Man we was Lonely ) but listen closely to what he's saying. He doesn't shove your face in how he feels, unlike Lennon's \\"How do You Sleep\\" or even Ringo's \\"Boogaloo\\". This album is the first glimpse we all got into who did what in the Beatles and, as basic as it is, opens a new door. Still on my top ten.
0375831002|4.0|I'm surprised to see this listed as a young adult book. It is written from a very different perspective and a different flow than usual. I didn't like how it jumped around a little. However the story itself was very gripping and I wished for more information at the end. Like, if Liesel and Max got married or stayed friends, etc.
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather by Mario Puzo, written in 1969, is one of the top selling books of all time. The Godfather has all of the key elements found in these books - sex, drugs, power, violence, and twisted situations. What helps the Godfather stand apart is how well it has become integrated in modern culture. Look at the other titles which have sold this much - To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Animal Farm, Carpetbaggers. Sure, many of us have read them, and sure, we might recognize a specific line from each book. But do we know the entire *culture* that any of these books represent? Probably not. With The Godfather, there are tons of lines that have become part of our culture. There are tons of visual images that are now part of what we all accept as \\"history\\". Just as we understand what \\"raining cats and dogs\\" mean, we understand what \\"sleeping with the fishes\\" mean. The Godfather has that kind of power.<br /><br />Even if you force someone to read a long book, they rarely remember it if it does not strike a chord. Many of us were forced to read \\"Moby Dick\\" in high school - but besides \\"Call me Ishmael\\", I doubt many people remember much of it. I happen to love Moby Dick, but then again I love Nantucket :) However, compare this with The Godfather. The Godfather is not a short book, and it is not an \\"easy\\" book. It skips between time settings, it brings in a new culture, new language, and a large cast of characters. Still, it is eagerly gobbled up by the readers. We want to know what Michael Corleone does next - who will betray the Don - what this offer is that can't be refused. We are tittilated by the references to \\"female surgery\\" that makes a woman tight again.<br /><br />The writing isn't super simplified, as are some other books in this category. If anything, it can become quite formal at times. The author understands the power of language, having his characters sometimes speak forcefully, other times speak deliberately \\"like a peasant\\" so that they are underestimated. This again helps to keep the reader interested, to look for hidden meanings in words, to seek out what is really being said amongst the words that are being spoken.<br /><br />It's almost impossible, reading the book in modern times, to separate this book from the culture it has spawned. There are the movies, The Sopranos, Goodfellas, and every other Italian Mob story which bases its genesis on this series. The walk, the talk, the atmosphere.<br /><br />Yes, you might have watched the movies - but it's *well* worth it to read the original story. As is true with pretty much any novel, the movie has to simplify to squash the plot into a 2 hour stretch. In the novel provides much more detail, intricacy, and texture.<br /><br />This is one of those books that is almost required reading, so that you understand all of those quotes, visuals and situations thrown into modern literature, movies and TV shows. Luckily, unlike many other 'must read novels', this is really a page-turner!s again helps to keep the reader interested, to look for hidden meanings in words, to seek out what is really being said amongst the words that are being spoken.<br /><br />It's almost impossible, reading the book in modern times, to separate this book from the culture it has spawned.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|I am not a country or folk music fan. I didn't know much about Emmylou Harris but was familiar with Mark Knopfler (from Dire Straits). On the recommendation of a friend I checked this CD out. I was completely blown away. Seldom do I come across an album that I can't put down but this is one of them. Harris and Knopfler sound absolutely fantastic. Their vocals work so well together and the song writing is top notch. Mark Knopfler's guitar work winds a wonderful thread through all the songs without overshadowing the vocals. This album has the right mix. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone looking for high quality music that you can listen to over and over again. Even if you are not a country or folk music fan.
0670038040|5.0|`Let nobody be in any doubt, the rules of the game are changing' quoth Mr T Blair a couple of months ago. I know what I thought about that, I would have expected John Mortimer to think much the same, and thankfully he is still around to put the issue across far better than I could. Readers of his other work, not only the Rumpole stories but also, say, Dunster, will know what world-view to expect from him by now - justice and fairness are very little better than a lottery but the fight for them must and will go on. Mortimer is a novelist of course, not an essayist, but the pamphleteering element is perhaps the most important ingredient in his novels, as it might be thought to be in those of Dickens.<br /><br />Mortimer's much-loved anti-hero Horace Rumpole, an undistinguished but astute and sharp-tongued lawyer, is here again, this time to take part in Mr Blair's game whose rules are changing. Blair (himself a lawyer and whose wife is an advocate of the greatest distinction in the field of - human rights, wouldn't you believe) never tackles the issue head-on, and small wonder. We can follow the changes he is making (or trying to make) but we get only evasions from him when we try to ascertain just how these changes impinge on the fundamental rights enshrined in the Magna Charta, particularly of course the entitlement of Habeas Corpus. We all know that we face a new type of threat, we all know that national security is paramount, we all have a general idea of the particular culture the threat comes from, we all know that detection and obtaining evidence are vital to thwarting terrorist outrages, we all know that secrecy is vital to the security services, but these generalities - disputed by nobody - are all that Tony will tell us. When misgivings are expressed about extending the period over which suspects can be detained without being charged, when clarification is sought of such a novel legal concept as `glorifying' terrorism, when it is proposed to withdraw the right of trial in open court, when the fundamental entitlement to a presumption of innocence until proved otherwise looks itself to be under attack from new legislation, he just reiterates that we face a new type of threat, that national security is paramount and so on and so on. What exactly the `game' is I'm not fully clear, but the rules of the debate seem to involve going round in circles while the general direction of travel ought to give rise to general alarm.<br /><br />Hang the issue around Rumpole and we have a very entertaining narrative as usual, given a new spice from the contributions of She, who is writing Her memoirs too. She still doesn't purport to be much more than a caricature, and it's probably fair to say the same of the other participants in the story except of course Rumpole. I'm sure a certain amount of drawing from life has gone on, but I can only partly appreciate it. I'm in no doubt that the name Lamorna Cove refers to a certain famous advocate, but I'm missing the point of the allusion through not being myself a lawyer. Again, there have been four Home Secretaries in Blair's government, I'd be surprised if the fictional Home Secretary here is not modelled to some extent on these but I'm not sure what parallels Mortimer is really drawing. And of course I cannot even imagine which Lord Chancellor he had in mind when he makes one of his characters say `The Lord Chancellor doesn't get drunk.' I like to think, or at least to hope, that there is an element of exaggeration in this tale of ego-trippers, placemen, amorous judges, conservative prejudices, playing to the gallery, second-guessing public reactions, political pressures and improper influence masquerading as the administration of English justice. I take some comfort from the thought that there is a strong parodistic strain in the narrative, and that some of the main turns of events, such as the Perry-Mason-style denouement in court are pantomime scenarios rather than real life. However even if so I'm uncomfortably aware that it's only exaggeration, not outright invention. In the last resort Mortimer knows the courts and I don't.<br /><br />We all love Rumpole, and I'm sure it gave his creator pleasure to trundle him out again on his Rosinante of stubborn and cynical opposition to the forces of sheer irrationality that seem to be inherent in the culture of all large organisations and of the law in particular. However at age 83 and in frail health Sir John is not likely to have written this novel just as a labour of love. This book is a pamphlet in narrative garb, created out of an urgent sense of alarm. I quite concede that Mortimer's advocacy is one-sided, but that's advocacy. After all, there are real problems for the police in obtaining evidence within the timeframe permitted under the current law.

In the last resort Mortimer knows the courts and I don't.    We all love Rumpole, and I'm sure it gave his creator pleasure to trundle him out again on his Rosinante of stubborn and cynical opposition to the forces of sheer irrationality that seem to be inherent in the culture of all large organisations and of the law in particular. However at age 83 and in frail health Sir John is not likely to have written this novel just as a labour of love. This book is a pamphlet in narrative garb, created out of an urgent sense of alarm. I quite concede that Mortimer's advocacy is one-sided, but that's advocacy. After all, there are real problems for the police in obtaining evidence within the timeframe permitted under the current law.

B000KMHUYC|5.0|Beautiful film, buy a region 2 DVD player if you dont have one, because you need to see this verson of the film. Dont settle for any other copy, I got it in France and it's a beautiful transfer. If you're a Lynch fan, a mystery fan (Man) or even a surrealist fan, get this now.
0385484518|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. It uses such simple words, but teaches so much. I have read this book for the thrird time now and I feel that each time I read it I learn something new. It is so great because it comes from a guy who is really dieing, but does not see the bad part of it, instead he sees it as a perfect opportunity to teach not just his former student, but everyone who walks into his life the greatest life lesson. Live, learn and love life. Morries believed greatly in have a wonderful life when you are alive he belived in living life to its fullest until your very last breath. And he did. Overall I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It is not hard so it does not take an expert to read it. Expect to appreciate life more when you are done reading it.  <br /> <br />
B0002V7O3I|5.0|I love this film. I saw it when I was pretty young and absolutely loved it, as I do much of Dante's flicks from this time - The Burbs, Gremlins, InnerSpace - and I still love it to this very day. in fact, I understand the ending a little better now. I remember the ending being quite disappointing in some senses. The aliens just dont live up to the majesty that proceeds them, and this is exactly how the main character played by Ethan Hawke feels. So in some senses this could be seen as truly amazing film-making. But maybe I am being a little silly through my love of the film, which also I must add, has one of the best themes. A theme which only arrives half way through the film, when their craft is almost finished in its building. I love this film, but I can understand that some people may not enjoy it or even find it to be that good a film.<br /><br />By the way, just for good measure I thought, that I would use the word (I) as many times as possible in this revIew. You like?? Yes? If you don't you can get the Fu@k out...

0887307280|5.0|You leave your old self behind and start a new journey as you read this book. The text intercuts between solid business research and a very compelling story of Sara, the discouraged entrepreneur who relearns the reasons why she tried to start a business in the first place. While reading, I found myself doing two things I rarely do: Paging backward to re-read several passages; and smiling. The book is that good. It forced me to shift my thinking about my real strengths, hopes and goals. I'm not currently running my own business but plan to in 1-2 years, with e-Myth Revisited at my side. This book gets the mental sparks flying. You will get inspiration that you can use in your corporate job from this book.

0618680004|5.0|This would have been the headline not too many years ago.  Deny God?  Simply not done.  As many, many Middle Ages philosophers and early scientists learned to their sorrow.  Dawkins has written a brave book which will rarely be read by those who most need to read it, the Delusioned.  Not the greatest book I ever read stating the God Delusion, that would be several volumns of the Will and Arial Durant series, The Story Of Civilization.  But it has the advantage of being much fuller of current science and modern events.  And fewer pages.  This later might inspire a few more of the delusioned to read it than would the Durants marvelous works.
B0007OY2P8|5.0|It is my contention that the spirit of this movie is more true to Austen's own than any of the other Austen productions. I can hear the gasps as I write. <br /> <br />There's no doubt that virtually all other productions are far more true to literal interpretations of their books. The text is usually more exact, the adherence to plot (even when forced to abridge) is better, but still other productions come off as stilted. Why is that? <br /> <br />The actors chosen for Northanger Abby are physically much more of a match. Austen did not describe these characters as beautiful, except for Isabella, and the other actors (however attractive in real life) are not photographed as beauties. They look like Austen's real people, not idealized characters from random romances. <br /> <br />In addition, the actors are truly splendid in their amazingly nuanced characters. While the various Darcys and other Austen heroes on film are usually handsome but somewhat constipated looking (running the emotional gamut from A to B), this Tilson manages to show a range of complex emotions just as described in the book. I could go on with praising the voices/vocal characteristics of the various actors, but I think you should just give it a try.  <br /> <br />Open your mind, remember the book, and you will love this movie.

B00004STDN|4.0|While this movie is not as dramatic on DVD as it was in theatres, the scenery is still great, with lots of action sequences and a great performance from John Lithgow in the bad guy role, Cliffhanger is one of the great action flicks and still one of Stallone's best. At a cheap price, this is a great buy, strongly recommended.
B00005JOLI|2.0|Eragon- While the actors and special effects were excellent, I couldn't get over the story line.  I read and liked the book.  They skipped and completely left the story line in the movie so often it was hard to keep up.  If I were Chris Paolini I would be furious at how they butchered my story.  The dumbest part was when Saphira was first learning to fly.  She took off a baby dragon and came back full grown.  This book's story was destroyed in the theater.  Maybe my expectations were too high as I went to see the movie looking for Lord of the Rings quality and I got a USA up all night with Joe Bob Briggs movie.  Had they made this movie 3 1/2 hours long and stayed with the story line it would have rivaled Lord of the Rings.  As it is we may never see Eldest in theaters.
0783233477|4.0|First of all I would like to get the negative points of the movie out of the way. For starters, it is way too long. I think it is completely un-necessary for a movie to go longer than two hours, and at 173 minutes, meet joe black plays out way too long. Some scenes seem to drag out forever and could have quite easily been edited down even more. Second of all, the sound quality on the DVD is poor. The music score is recorded too loud while the dialogue is too soft. I found myself continuously adjusting the volume to hear the dialogue in some parts and to turn down the music in others.<br /><br />On a positive note, I found Meet Joe Black to be a very entertaining movie nonetheless. Well scripted and featuring excellent performances by Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani, it is a sad movie while delivering a positive message at the same time.<br /><br />Brad Pitt faces his toughest role to date as the Grim Reaper, or Death. Spending a few days on Earth, he is shown the world through the body of an ordinary person by his tour guide Bill Parish, played by Anthony Hopkins. Parrish agrees to be his tour guide in exchange to spend a bit more time on earth to be able to close up a few loose ends of his business as well as to properly say goodbye to his loving daughters.<br /><br />Along the way, both Pitt and Hopkins learn many valuable lessons about love, honesty, betrayel and strength of character. The two actors play their parts perfectly and Forlani also is a shining light as Hopkins daughter and Pitt's love interest. The film builds to a dramatic yet predictable conclusion, but yet is still an emotional ending.<br /><br />Not a great deal to speak of in the special feautures, but you get a trailer, cast bio, production notes and an on the set documentary.<br /><br />A feel good movie with a positive message, a good movie to add to the collection.
0743289412|1.0|Stephen King has let us down once again.  <br /> <br />Ever since he ruined the Dark Tower books with the worst conclusion to a series EVER, King doesn't seem to care about wrapping up a story.  The Colorado Kid, The Cell, and the first 50 miserable pages of Lisey's Story simply don't take the reader anywhere.  King's writing has morphed into this artsy mess that bears no resemblance to his classic works.   <br /> <br />The average reader wants a PLOT.  We want a clear introduction, a clear conflict, and we want to be able to take guesses as to how the conflict might be resolved.  We read to escape the outside world and to get caught up in plot.  But with Lisey's Story, I find myself wanting to escape this pathetic novel.   <br /> <br />I've never abandoned a book by King, but there's first time for everything...

B000IHY9SE|3.0|Eminem's latest project \\"Eminem Presents: The Re-Up\\" (2006) is a solid release. The highlight of this release for me was Eminem's exceptional closer \\"No Apologies\\", a powerful cut where Shady shines dropping some on point lyrics matched by an addictive beat. Eminem lets the critics know what he thinks of them, and shows that he can still rip up tracks with the same hunger he had as a young MC. Another favorite track of mine is the single \\"You Don't Know\\", 50 Cent, Ca$his,Lloyd Banks and Eminem deliver a killer collaboration, a cut to blast in the ride. Another memorable collaboration is an older released Eminem/Proof (R.I.P.) collab on the grimy \\"Trapped\\". The album's Remixes are decent but are not much different from the original tracks (IE Pistol Pistol, Ski Mask Way, Smack That). I am not that impressed with some of the up and coming MC's Shady is bringing in: Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater, Cashis. All the same Eminem, and 50 provide highlight track's making this Mixtape a release worth checking out. 3.5.
0441172717|1.0|This may be the most overrated book of all time. I had expected to like it a lot, but the reality was otherwise.  <br /> <br />First, let's start with the good: The setting of Arrakis is cool. So much for the good. <br /> <br />On the bad side, we have uniformly unappealing, sterotypical characters. We have utterly plain, unlyrical, and occasionally incomprehensible writing that belongs in a middle school literary journal, not in a published novel. Worst of all, it seems like fully half this book consists of the internal thoughts of the characters. Where's the \\"show, don't tell\\" concept that everyone learns on the first day of creative writing class? This book is 450 pages of \\"tell\\" and 50 pages of \\"show.\\"  <br /> <br />Finally, if you haven't read this monstrosity yet, here's a paragraph from the book to show you the kind of writing you're missing: \\"This realization returned a small measure of confidence, and again she ventured to focus on the psychokinesthetic extension, becoming a mote-self that searched within her for danger.\\" Writing of this quality speaks for itself.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|finally all the live albums of Kiss in one package and a lavish one that is. not only for the Kiss fan but for anyone who can appreciate a good rock concert (registration), complete with lot of explosions,  with a few unexpected extras included. There is the single live-version of \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\" added to Alive II and on Alive III is \\"Take it Off\\" an extra bonustrack. Also is brandnew and otherwise not available the reunionconcrt 1999/2000 with the 4 original members. Comes in that each album has a clear sound is now released on a single disc. Further there is a lovely booklet with many never before seen pictures of the band playing live. So this is a great Christmas 2006 gift for everybody. It brings alive kind memories of seen concerts and proves proudly that apart from the outrageous stageshow the original and later members of the band really could play and write nice songs. Not much to add to that.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|There are several outstanding features of Mystic River; the superb acting by the three male lead actors, the twisted unfolding plot, and the underlying theme of revenge and justice. I will discuss all three below. <br /> <br />You can not beat Sean Penn's acting in this film. He portrays a rough man of the streets, trying to hold a family together and run a business, in a working class blue-collar neighborhood. He is fully alive in this role, as protective father seeking the murderer of his elder daughter while simultaneously dealing with his intense grief. His wife, Laura Lenney, describes him best in the final minutes of the film, when she emotionally absolves him of the murder of a childhood friend he mistakenly believes killed his daughter. She evokes the Jungian archtype of the king as she tells him he is a king who protects his family and home and that he acted on the best evidence he had, even if that evidence is flawed. <br /> <br />Tim Robbins was amazing as the odd adult male who is still damaged by the childhood rapes he endures for 4 days at the hands of two male pediophiles. He now sees himself as a child continually trying to escape from the werewolves, which are the memories of the molestation he experienced. His oddity however marks him as a suspect for the murder of a 19 year old girl. <br /> <br />Kevin Bacon plays the tight competent policman, trying to control his emotions under all circumstances when we see evidence that this strategy drove his wife from him. <br /> <br />The story-line unfolds gradually, tragedy after tragedy, misunderstanding after misunderstanding, like a house of cards falling apart in slow motion. The interaction of the three main actors form the structure around which all the tragedy flows. Clint Eastwood paced this film very well, never rushing and never boring the audience.  <br /> <br />Underlying the plot however is the themes of justice, revenge, and our connectedness in a web of relationships. The film asks whether justice can ever be obtained and is it right to take justice into our own hands. In this case we see two men try to take justice into their own hands, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, and the tragedy that unfolds because of that. <br /> <br />However the film also displays our interconnectedness in that the dynamics of the tragedy are in the past and the tragedy continues into the future. As you watch, notice how much the murder of Just Ray by Sean Penn sets up the dynamic whereby Sean refuses to have his daughter date the son of Just Ray - a dynamic that begins the current tragedy of his daughter's death. So it is not just the molestation of Tim Robbin's character that sets the stage, it is also Sean Penn's murder of an old friend who betrays him that sets in play the death of his own daughter. On the day of her funeral, Sean Penn sits on his backporch, and addressing the trees and spirit of his daughter he says \\"I know that somehow I am responsible for your death, but I don't know how.\\"  The film reveals to him and to us  how he was responsible. <br /> <br />The film does not end on happy note, for Sean Penn kills again and this time it is a damaged man, also a secret killer. In the final scenes a softball parade goes through town, the characters lock eyes, knowing that an impure justice has occurred with which they all must live and the young son of the deceased Tim Robbins, sitting on a float in his softball uniform, implies that it will cycle through again, unresolved, because justice and revenge are structures of human interaction and relationship, not absolutes.
B000J103PC|4.0|The film version of this story capitalizes on the interesting premise of a young, intelligent woman facing the `boss from hell' in the glamorous world of high fashion. I hesitated to see this movie because I read the book when it first came out and thought it was one of the most dreadful pieces of garbage I'd ever read. (One star, with the headline, \\"Nothing But Hype--Awful.\\")  The performances of all the characters bring this fun little tale to life, and make the characters believable and sympathetic. Ultimately, it's just an entertaining, fluffy little story, and anyone who has a remote interest in fashion will find this even more alluring.<br /><br />Meryl Streep embodies the role as fashion editor Miranda Priestly, and manages to give the character a certain degree of likeability. The same is true for Emily Blunt, who plays the neurotic first assistant to Miranda. I had no problem sharing this with my young daughters, believing it gave them a glimpse into what it might be like to work for a difficult boss--not a unique scenario for young women fresh out of university.<br /><br />\\"That's all!\\"<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.

B0007GAEGC|1.0|I have to agree with the other reviewers who point out (rightly) that this is not Celtic music, and that the performances are weak and uninspired.  The PBS show was mildly entertaining for a few minutes, but it became obvious quickly that these interpretations of traditional music are more \\"lite commercial pop\\" than anything else.  The derivation from Flatley's shows was obvious. Also I agree that PBS has so diluted its offerings in fine arts with this, Andre Rieu, Andrea Bocelli, Charlotte Church, and other \\"pseudo-classical\\" performances that it is deeply disappointing.  <br /> <br />Instead of this drivel, go for music with real substance, including really traditional Celtic music (without the soft haze of easy listenin') and the enormous treasure of art music (renaissance, baroque, classical, etc.) which reward repeated listening with new discoveries.  Other reviewers have made fine suggestions.

B00009RGBS|5.0|Altogether, it was wonderful.  I KNEW the choreography was by Bob Fosse, but thought he was retired or something, then saw someone else's name in the credits and figured I was wrong.  Then read some of these reviews and found that it at least derived from Fosse.  WHOEVER thought it up, it was stunning and exciting.  The lyrics were pedestrian with scads of false rhymes.  The music sounded like Cabaret rejects.  The only song (except those dreadful words) to write home about was the first one.  The rest were mediocre, but taken as a whole, concept, plot, songs, acting, dancing, AND DIRECTING it was wonderful.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  But sigh especially to anyone who liked the movie of Cabaret.  Kander and Ebb are at rock bottom of my list of songwriters, but I thought the score of the movie of Cabaret (not the Bway show) was brilliant, not a lemon in it.  Chicago and Cabaret are almost identical.  I searched through Netflix for another musical with Catherine Zetta-Jones (I loved her, especially with that haircut), but alas could find none.  She was glorious.  Richard Gere was great when he was acting serious, but (except for his ventriloquist number, which was wonderful) I didn't care for him in the fantasy episodes.  It's a sordid, morbid, CYNICAL story, but so was Cabaret (the rise of the nazis).  I'm seriously thinking about buying this movie, to have, to watch again (and maybe a few more agains after that).  Every person on the screen did a superlative job in his/her part.  One comment on another review.  I don't think Bway shows are all that wonderful on stage.  In fact, I don't think they're wonderful at all.  The music may be good (but usually it's not), the lyrics are invariably mediocre at best, most usually just bad, and the books are invariably long and boring as hell.  There are exceptions.  I saw a Noel Coward show (many times) I liked, and Rodgers' No Strings (1st show I ever saw onstage) enthralled me.  Of course, I was a child at the time, but Istill love the songs.  Enough wool-gathering.  Chicago may not be for everyone, but I loved it.

0312323867|5.0|An Emily Giffin book is a soft caress disturbed by an occasional outburst of laughter. Her writing is marred with ripples of humor and real life relationship woes as she is a brightly shining star whom by far surpasses chick lit authors on the market. <br /> <br />This warm and engaging story is a follow up to Giffin's previous novel \\"Something Borrowed\\" but can be read out of order or on it's own but I seriously recommend reading all of her novels. In this story the main character is Darcy, a fashion forward, beauty and money obsessed thirty year old who soars in her PR work world in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> While engaged to Dex, her perfect boyfriend of seven years, Darcy finds herself in an awkward position when she discovers that her mousy best friend Rachel has stolen her fiancées heart and mind. Not so pure herself, the main character is as flawed as a colander I rinse my cooked pasta and fruits in but she has plenty of warm charm under her childish coat of arms and her superficial at times attitude. She can be hard to like but I found myself rooting for her, even though all her friends were picking sides and they seemed to be on Rachel and Dex's side, but for a reason I wish not to spoil to anyone. Alone and confused, in an interesting condition, Darcy tried to re-assemble her life, regroup her remaining friends and to come out on top of the dating world, proving she can find her prince charming even when her entire life is falling through a paper shredder of emotions. When she visit her parents back in Indiana and to her annoyance sees that all her friends and family are either engaged or terribly happy she starts to break down and looses the grip on the situation she could always control simply based on her good looks when those aren't enough anymore.  <br /> <br />Darcy finds herself shocked and upset that her plain looking friend stole her perfect man and she goes half way across the world to London to visit her childhood friend Ethan who seems to side with Rachel as well. Distressed and crushed again Darcy has to find her true self in the sea of strangers and to win their affection she has to rely on the quality of her soul and not on her perfect highlights or expensive frocks and a model thin body. I absolutely adored Darcy's challenges and her fallouts and wished her all the best as I cheered her on in my mind and was pleasantly surprised and at times appalled at things that happened to her. . I was also extremely impressed with the author's ability to argue both sides, Darcy and people she went head -to- head with, they all had valid points and I couldn't believe at times that the situations they were in were written by one person. The books feels and reads like a real life drama and it was a wonderful interruption to my usually busy work weeks. <br /> <br />Darcy is hilarious, a real hoot who quickly disarmed me even though I have no patience for silly characters and I hope to read about her in future books by this stunningly talented author.  <br /> <br />- Kasia S. <br />

0679722610|5.0|Nowadays, not many people think of reading a pulp detective novel from 1929.  Most would expect the plot to be superficial, the characters one-dimensional, and the dialogue filled with obscure eighty year-old words like 'dames', 'dingus', 'gams', and 'gat'.<br /><br />But 'Red Harvest' is one of the best (are there any bad ones?) novels from Dashiel Hammett, arguably the most artful if not memorable detective story writer of all time.<br /><br />If you are reading this, then you are already a fan of the genre or you are branching out from your usual 'mystery' choice.  You're looking for an entertaining read that won't dumb you down.  You're hoping to stumble upon a lesser-known gem from a great mystery writer.  Or maybe to find out why they say Hammett was so good.  Well, you've found it.<br /><br />I won't recount the story line--- plenty of other reviewers will do that.  But I will tell you why you should buy it and read it.<br /><br />'Red Harvest' is a fine piece of American literature, one of the most perfect detective novels I've read.<br /><br />The serpentine plot winds it way between the predictable and unpredictable, telling the story about one man against an entire town.  In 2007 this might seem trite and overdone, but it was a fresh idea in 1927.<br /><br />If violence and gunplay is your thing, you're in luck.  Chapter 21's title is 'The Seventeenth Murder'.<br /><br />The Obscure 1920's Gangster Dialogue Index is set to 'Low'.  I don't want Edgar G, Cagney or Bogie to pop into my mind while I'm forming my own mental image of the character.<br /><br />Dialogue and exposition are extremely well-written.  Words tumble naturally from the pages like dice in a crapshoot.<br /><br />In his exquisite portrait of femme fatale Dinah Brand, Hammett succeeds in the difficult task of capturing for his reader the essence of a physically imperfect woman who has perfected the art of attraction and allure, enchanting any man she wants.<br /><br />Best of all things about `Red Harvest' is the wily Continental Op himself.  He appears a deceptively average guy: anonymous, middle-aged, average height, soft around the middle, receding hairline.  But smart and tough as nails, he's not one to cross.eceptively average guy: anonymous, middle-aged, average height, soft around the middle, receding hairline.

0743298020|5.0|An intriguing tale!<br /><br />This book, as stated in many other reviews, was difficult to put down; what seemed to start as a quiet, docile story turned out to be an intriguing investigative mystery.<br /><br />The novel is well written, has a good sense of pace and timing that add to an increasingly foreboding atmosphere. It also has that wonderful quality, usually found in a good book, of wanting to make you read one more chapter.<br /><br />All in all an good novel that keeps you coming back.  Recommended...5 Stars.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Lets be real. This movie is good, and I mean really good. Don't act like your not impressed. Will Ferrell is a genius, honestly. If you disagree with me I will fight you. Simple as that. I will fight you. This movie is rich and compelling. Bottom line. You won't regret watching this movie. Bottom line. I mean who cares if he doesn't speak spanish? He looks really good in this movie. He makes Sinatra look like a Hobo. This movie is also very informative. It could be a documentry. You learn alot about things you probably wouldn't have known before you watched this movie. For instance, did you know diversity was a old old wooden ship that was used in the civil war era? I'll be the first one to say I did not know that. I also was unaware of the meaning behind the name San Diego. I also didn't know that the germans discovered San Diego. Suffice to say, I learned a lot while watching this movie. Go watch it now.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division is by now the most widely recognized WWII unit, thanks to the efforts of Stephen Ambrose and now this fabulous HBO series directed by Tom Hanks and David Frankel. The series follows Easy's story from training camp, through D-Day and beyond, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and the Eagle's Nest. The old cliche that if it wasn't true, nobody would believe it really applies to their exploits.<br /><br />Damian Lewis shines as Dick Winters, the leader of Easy, as does Frank John Hughes playing Sgt. William 'Wild Bill' Guarnere, Dexter Fletcher as Sgt. John Martin, and Eion Bailey as Pvt. David Kenyon Webster.<br /><br />Each segment begins with the actual veterans speaking about their wartime experiences. 'Band of Brothers' is a DVD set worth owning - you'll want to watch it again and again.<br /><br />There are a number of books out covering Easy Company including the original Band of Brothers book by Ambrose. Winters has written a memoir. Another 101st Airborne author is Donald Burgett whose 'Currahee!: A Screaming Eagle at Normandy' and three other memoirs are far from the sanitized version of warfare presented by Ambrose. David Kenyon Webster's 'Parachute Infantry: An American Paratrooper's Memoir of D-Day and the Fall of the Third Reich' is an especially interesting memoir that was written by the Harvard garduate in the 1950's, well before the widespread interest in Easy Company.<br /><br />Highest recommendation for anyone interested in WWII.
0679745203|5.0|It's hard to believe Ondaatje wasn't inspired, above all else, by \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" especially in his characterization of a Katherine and Almasy whose obsession with love as possession is a latter-day equivalent of the undifferentiated passion of Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff.  And Ondaatje's related but contrasting pair of lovers, Hana and Kip, appear to occupy a place comparable with Bronte's Cathy Linton and Hareton, whose recognition of each other's separateness at least holds forth the promise of a relationship between two individuals.<br /><br />But Ondaatje surprises us.  His Kip and Hana finally retreat to the boundaries of nationality, race, and past traditions, reclaiming for themselves as much identity as such markers are capable of offering.  In \\"The English Patient\\" Almasy plays both the roles of Heathcliff and Hareton.  It is the latter who is redeemed from the primitive through the books Cathy finally shares with him, teaching him to separate himself from the primeval natural principle and to love.  Almasy learns much the same from his Kathy, who shows him the true meaning of Herodotus, of history, of words themselves.  He learns he cannot remain a free agent, avoiding responsibility and \\"ownership,\\" because without incurring debts to another person, agency is pointless and freedom is an illusion.  Almasy must lose his fabricated identity--symbolized by the \\"features,\\" or mere markers, of history, the desert, and the physical body--in order to gain his soul, which turns out to be Kathy.<br /><br />When Almasy makes good on his promise and returns to the cave, the necrophilia scene (as subtle as any in all literature--compare its obvious counterpart in \\"Wuthering Heights\\") is an electric and electrifying intercourse of tongues, an exchange of lying words for a shared language.  Kathy's sacrifice in taking into herself the old words of Almasy is her answer to his own sacrifice, an exorcism of the qualified, secretive language Almasy had formerly insisted on calling love.  With that act Almasy is transformed from \\"demon lover\\" to lover, from a desert nomad and recorder of landmarks to co-author of and mutual participant in a new \\"text,\\" an authentic discourse of love between two independent people who ultimately relate as one.<br /><br />To those who distrust the story's representations of history, remember that the story itself questions all such representations.  Which is not to say it's a \\"romance.\\"  It's a love story--above all, a love \\"history,\\" and as such it rings as true as any history since Emily Bronte's.ing love.

1878424505|5.0|I've read this book a half dozen times over the past year.  It was recommended by a friend and my initial reading left me in awe.  I repeatedly ran across some peice of insight that left me wondering if this book had been written for me.  It's simplicity and logic is what makes the book so fascinating.  There is no need to reread some convoluted paragraph or page as with most books of this nature.  I think about some aspect of it's teachings practically every day.  I have seen immediate changes in my disposition and perspective in dealing with people.  One example that stands out in my mind is an occasion where I overheard a negative remark about me uttered by someone who was merely an aquaintance.  Instead of becoming defensive, hurt, possibly belligerent, I automatically, without having to consiously remind myself not to take things personally, shrugged off his comment and I've only grown closer to this individual since.

B0006GVJEE|5.0|Released in 1994 to rave reviews, Luc Besson's sordid 1994 thriller \\"Leon - The Professional\\" is often regarded as one of the finest crime drams ever, and rightfully so.<br /><br />This uncut edition restoes over 20 minutes of never before seen footage that is a treat for fans of the movie as well as those who are seeing it for the first time.<br /><br />Leon (Jean Reno) is an Italian hitman working for a New York mob boss (Danny Aiello), and he's the best at his field. However, his expertise is soon going to put to a different use. When his 12 year old neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her film debut) witnesses her family get murdered by a crooked Fed named Stansfield (the amazing Gary Oldman) and his crew, Leon takes her in and poses as her father. Heartbroken over the death of her 4 year old brother, Mathilda coerces Leon into teaching her how to become a hitman. Reluctantly, Leon agrees, and in return Mathida teaches him to become a compassionate, loving and caring person. The tow form a bond, one that almost becomes something more.<br /><br />When Mathilda takes matters into her own hand, Leon now has to be more alert than ever in order to see Stansfield doesn't get to her first. It is a truly well written and amazingly acted (Portman steals the show in her first film role) film.<br /><br />This deluxe edition comes with an awesome array of special features. This is a film I would recommend to most people.
B000065V9Y|5.0|Being a big fan of Peter Gabriel anyways, I picked this up for the hit \\"Steam\\" and was overjoyed with the product. His musical diversity throughout the album is incredible but takes a minute to adjust to, honestly. Once you realize what the content is about, however (throughout the breakup of his marriage of his wife Jill) you begin to piece together  what's going on in the head of a brilliant musician. This album, to me, is more than just a montage of songs, it's a culmination of the \\"why's\\" and \\"where did we go wrong?\\"'s of any long term relationship, intermingled with the frustration that everyone goes through....just voiced through song. The songs \\"Come Talk To Me\\" and \\"Secret World\\" showing just how distraught he was with trying to work through the entire ordeal.. I STRONGLY reccommend this CD, not only if you're just a Peter Gabriel fan, but if you need a great understanding that there are good guys out there CD.
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|No director has ever done a better job than Maretin Scorsese at taking moveigoers into the life of the mafia headfirst, and his 1995 movie \\"Casino\\". Though not as purely enjoyable or fast paced as \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"Casino\\" is most certainly a brilliant piece of cinema, a masterpiece that only Scorsese can provide.<br /><br />Like \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"Casino\\" is based on a true story (and also on a book based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi). Set in 1973, \\"Casino\\" tells the story of Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a small time hood who sets his sights on owning the Las Vegas strip. With the help of his lifelong friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci in a spellbinding performance on par with his unfrogettable Tommy DeVito), Ace becomes the biggest hotshot in town. He's rich, successful and married to the beautiful Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). Him and Nicky are on top of the world.<br /><br />But soon, things start to take a downfall. Nick's violent temper and mob connections get him thrown out of every casino in town, while Ace begins to lose control of his empire (and to an extent, some of his mind) in a crooked court case, and Ginger has become a drug addict and soon moves back in with her former pimp, Lester Diamond (the always fantastic James Woods). As the film reaches its shocking (and violent) climax, each of these characters heads for a swift downfall brought on by greed, betrayal and violence. It's a lurid, almost disturbing vision that only Scorsese can provide.<br /><br />\\"Casino\\" is undoubtedly one of the best movies Scorsese ever did. Everything about it clicks. I do prefer \\"Goodfellas\\" because it was more enjoyable and not as grim, but \\"Casino\\" still manages to fire on all cylinders.<br /><br />This special edition is a must for all fans of the movie. Overall, I highly recommend it.
B000EULJLU|4.0|When I first picked up this album, I didn't really like it, so I ended up just putting it aside and listening to other things.  Then a few months later I decided to give it another listen.  I don't know what I was thinking the first time around.  This CD is incredible.  It just takes sometime to win you over. <br /> <br />Vicarious - 9/10 - This song was originally my favorite on the CD, mostly because it was the first I had heard because it had been on the radio.  But besides that it is still a very good song.  It is pretty heavy.  Still one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Jambi - 8/10 - Decent song.  Fairly heavy but ends a little suddenly. <br /> <br />Wings for Marie (Pt 1) - 7/10 - This song took awhile to win me over.  At first it was a song I usually skipped over.  It's pretty slow, but does pickup a little.  Goes nicely into the next song. <br /> <br />10,000 Days (Pt 2) - 9/10 - Another song that took a while to win me over.    It's very long, but very beautiful too.  Progressively gets harder and louder as the song goes on. <br /> <br />The Pot - 10/10 - Originally this was one of the few songs that I liked the first time I heard them.  It starts with Maynard singing in a higher pitched voice than you usually hear from him.  He maintains a higher than usual voice for most of the song, but it does drop from the beginning.  The song is heavy and fast from start to finish. <br /> <br />Lipan Conjuring - 3/10 - Obviously a filler, but good for a few listens.  I like to play this song around my non-Tool-fan friends just for a laugh. <br /> <br />Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann) - 2/10 - Boring.  Usually gets skipped.  Does go nicely into the next song however. <br /> <br />Rosetta Stoned - 10/10 - I love this song.  Loud, heavy, and fast from start to finish.  It's long, but every second is great. <br /> <br />Intension - 6/10 - Interesting and not a bad sound, but overstays its welcome.  It's slow beat and light vocals put me to sleep so I have to skip over this track,especially when I'm driving. <br /> <br />Right in Two - 10/10 - Another song I liked right from the beginning, but the more I listened the more I liked it.  Starts slow and progressively gets harder and louder.  It has a great climax and ending.  I could listen to this song forever. <br /> <br />Viginti Tres - 1/10 - Stupid.  Just some weird sounds and towards the end there is what sounds like a voice but you can't understand what it says.  This track is boring and always gets skipped to go back to the beginning of the album so I can listen to it again. <br /> <br />Final Score: 75/110 = 68.18% (score makes it look bad, but those good songs are good enough that you should give the CD some listens. <br /> <br />
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Along with \\"Fast Times At Ridgemont High\\" and \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\", \\"The Breakfast Club\\" ranks high among the elite list of 1980s' teen comedies. Few films have portrayed the high and lows of high school any better, and its characters and plot are still relatable today.<br /><br />My complaint in my review is the dvd. Sure the sound picture quality are better than ever, but hwere are the extras? C'mon, an audio commentary by the cast and crew would've been welcomed, as would a documentary. Needless, I am a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Still, the movie is brilliant, so it's still worth owning. But c'mon, some extras would've been nice.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|The travelling minstrel has returned at last.  It's been a long wait, but Canadian singer-harpist Loreena McKennitt fans shouldn't be disappointed with her new album - unless after all this time you were expecting something radically different.  Loreena has picked up the folk/new age sound right where she left off, with an exotic, beautifully produced eclectic concept album complete with Celtic and Eastern sounds and lyrics inspired by studious research and travels to out of the way places.  The style is very familiar, but it's been honed to perfection. <br /> <br />The gorgeous cover artwork invitingly features a night-time scene with an Eastern-looking tent in a forest in front of snow-capped mountains.  Inside, the booklet adds to the invitation: \\"Tell me, O muse, of those who travelled far and wide...\\".  It is in fact a diary of her travels, detailing the various historical or literary inspirations for each song, from the legendary home of King Midas to tombs of mummies on the Silk Road. <br /> <br />Loreena's cultural travelogues began with \\"The Visit\\" but became more developed over her next two albums \\"Mask and Mirror\\" and \\"The Book of Secrets\\".  In \\"Mask and Mirror\\", Loreena was inspired by Mediterranean travels.  In \\"Book Of Secrets\\" she had reached further, with songs about places from Ireland to Siberia, and her musical expressions by then included no less than two dozen collaborating musicians. <br /> <br />Some of those turn up again on \\"An Ancient Muse\\", like Brian Hughes on guitars and Celtic bouzouki, Rick Lazar on percussion, Hugh Marsh on violin, Nigel Eaton on hurdy-gurdy and Manu Katche on drums.  Added to these are the legendary Hossam Ramsay on percussion, Steafan Hannigan on Turkish clarinet and uillean pipes, George Kontogiannis on Greek bouzouki, the English gamba ensemble Fretwork, a choir and even choristers of Westminster Abbey.  And more!  Loreena unfortunately has again put her harp aside, perhaps, as she said to me once, because she hada rogue way of playing.  Sounded fine to me, but nevertheless her session musicians are again judiciously employed to provide a full, warm and sensuous backing that isn't too cluttered. <br /> <br />\\"An Ancient Muse\\", her seventh album (not including an EP and a live double), looks towards Mongolia, north-west China, Turkey, Greece and Jordan, all places where she explored Celtic history and prehistory.  Although naturally discovering diverse cultures, Loreena concludes \\"we are a culmination of our collective histories and there should be more to bind us together than tear us apart.\\"  Well said.  This \\"musical document\\" is indeed a kind of collective expression combining elements of these varied cultures, all put together in her own special way.  Loreena's early albums had both traditional and original songs.  Here they are all hers - only \\"The English Ladye and The Knight\\" (featuring the rich tones of Fretwork and the choir) is a poem by Sir Walter Scott. <br /> <br />Like \\"The Book of Secrets\\", this is a laid-back affair, dominated by a variety of strings and eclectic percussion.  Some might again wish for a little more action, but much of the simply constructed music's appeal lies in the colourful nuances of instrumentation, the intelligently creative arrangements and the engaging power of her pure voice. <br /> <br />So, more of the same, but how picturesque, elegant and accomplished it is. <br />
B000I5X80G|5.0|These were some of the best performances of Neil's career.  \\"Cowgirl\\" is simply amazing.  Definitely Crazy Horse at its best.  I can't believe people would call Danny Whitten a hack.  Poncho has gotten 300x better in the last 15 years than he was in the 1970s, but he is still not as good as Whitten.  I think a lot of Whitten's grooves are better than Neil's leads.  And his singing compliments Neil's really well.  I can't believe Neil released this, though.  Put out the damn archives already!  While this is definitely worth the money, many people already had this on bootleg.  Time to open up the vaults, Neil.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Like all of you, probably, I'm a diehard Beatles fan--I grew up with them  (I'm old enough--just--to remember singing along to them on the radio and they've been the soundtrack to my life ALL my life.) And like many Beatles diehards, when I heard about this album, I thought for sure that it had to be a silly endeavour at best--I mean, c'mon, Cirque de Soleil? Vegas? A collage? What in the world could Sir George Martin be thinking? <br /> <br />Man, oh man, was I ever wrong! <br /> <br />I'm not sure what role this plays in Cirque de Soleil's presentation (nor do I care), but this does NOT sound like a weird mish-mash of Beatles songs crammed together for some sort of novelty effect; in fact, I was quite pleasantly suprised to hear that most of the music was intact and that the sequencing really made even the wholly intact songs feel new.  On the other hand, what has been reworked sounds remarkable and fresh and... yes, as another reviewer said, it really DOES make one feel as if he's hearing these songs for the first time again. And let me tell you, I've wished all my life that I could experience that feeling again. Well, here it is. <br /> <br />Oh, and the sound? The 5.1 surround mix and fidelity in DTS is nothing short of amazing. This is a real gift to Beatles fans.
B000002I27|5.0|To me, this is a gorgeous work of dark romanticism, a beautiful black pool in moonlight.  The acoustic textures of drum, guitar, keyboards and voice are completely in sync: all four are liquid, hazy and always slightly manic.   The record creates a tremendously potent mood of sweet melancholy, of dream, of vaguely heartbroken yet nonetheless ecstatic love.  As ineffably poignant as poetry (and containing some rather good poetry), it is a strange and wondrous combination of love, hope, and violence that has become, probably irrevocably, part of my soul.  I cannot really imagine California without this record informing my visions.  And what visions \\"Strange Days\\" evokes!  The voice of an arguing couple coming down from a lit window at night...  A lonely poet wandering the beaches of LA at high tide, beginning to dance...  Cars going everywhere and nowhere down the highways of California...  Rain falling on the pages of a copy of one of Freud's works.... Red wine in a glass... something beautifully, unmistakably American, Californian, absolutely L.A. and nothing else, yet framing only all the most aesthetically perfect aspects of the culture, cutting out everything shallow and blunt... doing nothing less than redeeming L.A. from the bleary eye of its drunken daylight. <br /> <br />Amazing stuff.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|Syriana is a well done political hit piece staring an Alpha Male 90's hero gone to seed in the 0's. George is getting a bit thick around the middle.    The plot is clear, but left to the viewer to discern.  American greed is responsible for the repression and the violence in the Middle East.  Hezbollah are dignified, honorable liberators.  The down trodden Pakistani workers in the oil fields and shipping centers of the Gulf are exploited by their Islamic overlords because of  the big oil companies, Texans by the way, have coerced the Emir's into supporting the American economy.  Most viewers will be unaware that Emirs, sheiks and sultans have been using the fatalistic nature of Islam to exploit the felons, i.e. peasants, of the Arab world for over 1,000 years.    One scene typifies the \\"make the point - facts be gone\\" attitude of the author of the book on which this film is based who is the Executive Producer. Akbar Kurtha, one of my favorite actors, plays Meshal Al-Subaai, the western educated prince who wants to bring his region into the dominance it deserves and is ultimately murdered by the evil minions the Texas oil company -- the American CIA.  He says that his father would love to more for his down trodden masses but the American president rings him up and says there is unemployment in Washington state.  So the Emir buys a set of luxurious planes that his country does not need. Sounds plausible, but...  The United Arab Emirates, who's possession of their oil fields was protected by the father this president, placed one of the single single orders for luxury air liners not with Washington based Boeing, but Aerobus.  They have purchased 45 Aerobus A-380's.

0684824906|5.0|Is there another person in our nation's history that rose to prominence with absolutely the right skills at absolutely the right time to have as great an influence over critical events as Lincoln did? If there is such a person, it would be difficult for a book supporting that person to make as strong a case on their behalf as Goodwin has done in support of Lincoln. <br /> <br />I have been a great fan of Mr. Lincoln since childhood and have read numerous books on the Civil War. I think this book captures how truly remarkable he was both in intellect and demeanor better than anything else I'm familiar with.  Some historical accounts would lead one to conclude that Lincoln's cabinet did not hold him in high regard and continued to belittle him well into his Presidency. Clearly, that is simply inaccurate as the passages discussing Seward's affection and respect for Lincoln make clear. <br /> <br />Of those discussed at length in this book, I believe Edwin Stanton is the one that was most in need of a writer to paint a different picture of the man. The generally accepted view is that Stanton was hard man and Machiavellian in his efforts to impart his will regardless of Lincoln's view. The 3 books by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen come to mind.  Stanton may have been a difficult man but it sounds as though that was a function of the great responsibility he bore.  Doris Goodwin does Stanton a great service by showing how loved and respected he was by Lincoln. <br /> <br />I have to say, when reading about a self-made man that rose to greatness through sheer force of will and intellect, I can't help but to look less favorably on one who rose to power through sheer force of family connection.  <br />
0446310786|4.0|The scene is Northern Alabama, in the summer of 1935.  A young girl and two boys are seen in the yard of a brick house playing a kind of role-playing game.  One is swinging a pair of scissors around while the others are laughing and trying to avoid him.  Suddenly a call is heard, and the children put down their things to greet a coming man.  Scout Finch runs up to her father, Atticus, and hugs him. <br /> <br /> The book, To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, takes place in Northern Alabama, in the city of Maycomb.  People in Maycomb live by an unwritten caste system of insiders and outsiders.  They live almost alone and separate from the rest of the world, with few visitors, and an absence of commuting.  Segregation funs free, and the community lets one woman's claim cause the trial of another, Tom Robinson, just for the color if his skin. <br /> <br /> The story is seen through the eyes of a young impressionable girl, Scout Finch.  Growing up, Scout sees prejudice all around her and is brought up to accept it by her community.  However, her father, Atticus Finch, and her brother Jem are always there nudging her in the direction of equality when she fall astray. <br /> <br /> The main theme in this story is the tortures of prejudice and the striving for equality.  The emotions of prejudice ring clear not just between blacks and whites but inside the races as well.  There are strict social classes so that no matter where one turns, prejudice is staring right back at one's face. <br /> <br /> The story is based around the life of Scout Finch in the town of Maycomb in 1935.  For years, her brother, her friend Dill, and Scout dreamt of the almost legendary Boo Radley and of meeting him.  Their summers were spent dreaming of Boo, until their livers were shattered by the highly public trial of Tom Robinson.  In the coming months, Scout faces torment of all kinds, all because of her father defending Tom. <br /> <br /> All in all, I thought this was a book that most teenagers and adults could enjoy.   Seeing the world through the eyes of a child again really spoke to me in many ways.  Scout is so young and virtually unaffected by all the racism in her world, it takes me back to my experiences at her age.  If you want a classic novel that you won't be able to put down, then I highly recommend Harper Lee's masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird.
1400049628|5.0|This is not an appropriate gift for your schizophrenic uncle who has trouble telling reality from fiction.  Max Brooks has written this book like it's a true threat that we should all be getting prepared for.  His phrasing is both unsettling and hilarious.  It's not often I've felt those two emotions together.  I keep telling myself the threat isn't real, but still I think it's time to get started building a reinforced concrete wall 10 feet high around my property so I'll be ready for at least a class two zombie attack.  But every night I'll lie in bed worrying.  What if it moves to class three and the bodies of my former friends and neighbors who have now become zombies pile up until they form a wriggling undead ramp.  Then I'll wish the wall had been twenty or thirty feet high to give me more time.  Maybe I could add a metal framework and weld a rebar mesh over the top.  Then I'd sleep soundly with my earplugs in so the moans of the undead as they hunt won't drive me insane.  I'm lucky to have received this book from a caring friend before it was too late.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|I was seriously disappointed by Gwen Stefani's new album, I who had been a hude fan of \\"Love.Angel.Music.Baby\\". To me, she just took all the (few) bad things about her first solo album and just developped and focused on them. Songs like \\"Harajuku Girls\\" or \\"Hollaback Girl\\" weren't my favorites but the rest of the album was so good they just seem to enhance the other songs. Here I counted only three good songs: \\"The Sweet Escape\\", \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"Wonderful Life\\". All the others are only moderate rip-offs of \\"Hollaback Girls\\", they focuse on the beat and Gwen's rapping (or more talking) makes me want to gag. The whole album just basically gives me a headache (I absolutely LOATHE \\"Yummy\\" - how ridiculous is Pharell?). Download those three songs if you want the best from her but I do not recomend buying this album for yourself or offering it to any die-hard Gwen Stefani fan.
B00009AQMJ|5.0|Let's face it. A case can be made for Janis/Reiner in the First Concerto. A case can be made for several in the Second Concerto, and if you can put up with the execrable sound, the Horowitz/Barbirolli remains at the summit of all the Third Concertos, and finally a case can be made for Michelangeli/Gracis  for the Fourth Concerto, but NO ONE, absolutely NO ONE, has produced a complete set of such supreme pianistic splendor as Wild has here (despite a few cuts sanctioned by the composer).<br /><br />If you love Rachmaninov, buy this now. CASE CLOSED.
0920668372|5.0|This book is must have for any library as it expresses the bond and enduring love between a mother and child. As a mother I have cried so many times reading it to my sons, who now remember it, and see themselves older as the book described, and know that I would still rock them and tell them that I'll love them forever -- if I could pick them up!
B000IJ79WU|2.0|As has been already stated a lot of the 'new' footage leaves a lot to be desired. Fair enough Donner was aggrieved to have been removed from the film, but this version adds nothing to the movie itself or to Donners reputation. It is simply a marketing exercise to shift more Superman II units. The fact that Lester's original version is not here makes the whole package redundent. <br /> <br />This is not the movie from your childhood as many touching scenes are missing and have been replaced needlessly. The new stuff isn't all bad, but the ending is unforgiveable! Imagine children today seeing Superman The Movie and then watching this for the first time. Two movies with the same endings!!! <br /> <br />Pointless except as a curiosity.
B000H305U0|1.0|. . . . if there had never been a Michael Jackson?  Let's see, how `bout: <br /> <br />A)  Lionel Richie <br />B)  Bob Seger <br />C)  Michael Bolton <br />D)  Lou Reed <br /> <br />Seriously, this album exemplifies the state of today's R `n' B, which is so unoriginal and frantically imitative of previous musical stand-outs, that its sounds all blur into one bleary, beat-heavy mess.  In the eighties, there were startlingly original artists like the aforementioned MJ, Prince, Madonna, and others, and there was also a second tier of imitators like, let's say, Jody Watley or James Ingram, who couldn't hold a candle to those originals, but who did manage to carve out decent careers singing mush for the masses. Today's R `n' B is populated, crammed really, by \\"stars\\" who aspire to be like those originals, too, but they only reach that second tier of talent and product.  There are no really standout talents.  I blame Disney, who manufactured the leaders of this plastic, interchangeable style - Christina, Britney, Justin - and set the tone for much of the rest.  Most of their albums are \\"collaborations\\" with whomever the hot beatmasters may be at any given minute, but the results usually turn out pretty much the same.  The \\"lyrics\\" on this JT album are some of the lamest ever put to paper, if they even were put to paper, rather than made up during the recording sessions.  Justin alternates between singing gooey romantic lines or pathetic \\"dirty\\" \\"street\\" lines, and he and his collaborators work hard to get our feet moving.  But it's all just a batch of throwaway pap product, manufactured to sell rather than to have any real long-term emotional/intellectual impact.  Justin's singing is just okay, pretty affected, and he seems to have a winsome personality on TV.  But he's really quite a mediocre talent, without an original bone in his body, and this album's bland sameness and unwillingness to take any real chances undermine what little ambition JT may have for its staying power.  I feel bad for today's young audience who think this is \\"exciting\\", because they have only this kind of stuff fed to them. <br />

B00005JOLI|3.0|I have not yet read the novel ERAGON (I should get to it in the next month, though), but several of my friends have and many of them were very excited this summer after learning that a movie based upon the book was going to be released in December 2006.  Due to their enthusiasm and because the next Narnia movie won't be released until 2008, I gladly went with the theatre with them to see ERAGON.  I had also seen previews of the movie and it looked promising.  I ended up leaving the theatre disappointed.  What I had seen was a film that was full of promise and potential and could have been a great movie, but instead was a rushed and riddled, hodge-podge of myth, sci-fi, and fantasy clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />ERAGON takes place in world that resembles a middle-aged Earth, but on film looks more like a cheap imitation of THE LORD OF THE RINGS Middle Earth.  Eragon (Edward Speleers) is a young farm boy who lives with his uncle and cousin.  They live in the country, but the kingdom in which they live is ruled by an evil dictator named Galbatorix (John Malkovich).  Galbatorix is the last of the dragon riders.  The dragon riders used to be guardians of justice and agents of peace, but Galbatorix took advantage of fractions within the riders to kill them or their dragons off until he was the last of the dragon riders.  He then took control of the lands he was supposed to protect and killed any who stood in his way.  Much of the resistance was destroyed, but a fragment remained, hidden somewhere in mountains at the edge of the kingdom.  In addition to being the last dragon rider, Galbatorix also has an ally in a Shade named Durza.  Shades are basically magicians with demonic powers.<br /><br />Anyway, one evening while Eragon is hunting he discovers a large, beautiful blue stone.  Thinking he might be able to trade the stone for food he takes it.  It isn't until later that he discovers the stone isn't a stone at all, but is a dragon egg that hatches before his eyes.  The dragon is named Saphira and has selected Eragon as her rider.  Saphira was stolen from King Galbatorix and he's really mad about it.  Once it hatches, he wants Saphira's rider killed because if you kill the rider you kill the dragon. Eragon doesn't realize the peril he is in until a town vagrant named Brom comes to his aid and assist him on a journey to the rebellion stronghold in the mountains.  The return of the dragon riders was prophesized years ago and Eragon suddenly finds himself as a new hope for the fledging resistance.<br /><br />The plot of the movie sounds interesting enough, but the execution of that plot has been done poorly.  Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, John Malkovich, and Djimon Hounsou are all excellent actors but only Irons has any real screen time while the others are basically reduced to playing cameos.  Also, although Irons has a lot of screen time, his character doesn't have anything new or interesting to say.  The actors do their best, but with the writing given to them they come off being as water-downed version of characters from THE LORD OF THE RINGS, STAR WARS, HARRY POTTER, or THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA.<br /><br />Therein lays two of the major problems of the movie.  The writing is pretty lame and the most significant moments of the film seem to be cheap imitations of some of the most memorable fantasy and sci-fi films made.  Remember in LORD OF THE RINGS when Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are escaping the Ring Wraiths by leaving the Shire and crossing the river Brandywine?  That scene is in this movie.  Remember in the original STAR WARS when Obi-Wan Kenobi lets himself be struck down so he can become a part of the force and better help Luke?  That scene is in this movie, too.<br /><br />Another problem with the film is the pacing.  The entire movie runs about ninety minutes.  I couldn't believe the film was over when it ended.  I could tell that many things had been rushed through or totally skipped from the novel and I haven't even readthe book, yet.  The movie could have easily been expanded to two or two and a half hours and would probably have been a better picture.  A fantasy film of this magnitude needs time to simmer and fermentate.  It shouldn't be rushed.  I mean, the average children's animated movie runs around ninety minutes now, an epic fantasy adventure should at least be two hours long.<br /><br />The one thing that I was rather impressed by in the film was the dragon.  Since I haven't read the book, yet, I can't say how accurate the film version of Saphira resembles the way she is described in the novel.  What I can say is that Saphira looked very real on screen and is a beautiful creature to behold, fantastical or not.<br /><br />Overall, ERAGON is an average fantasy film that moves at a very rushed pace and never reaches the promise of the great movie it could have been.  I don't blame the director, but I do blame the studio because I know they pressured the filmmakers to finish the movie as fast as they could.  An epic fantasy film shouldn't be filmed in just a month.  Fans of the book might enjoy the movie, but they will probably be disappointed.

0312954468|5.0|What can i say other than read this book and see why it's one of the best books you will ever read.
B00005JOLI|4.0|Having read the books, I knew they would have to leave a lot out and make changes, so I was mostly concerned that they did a good job with Saphira, and was delighted that she looked and behaved as I had pictured her. I thought the special effects were very good, better then Narnia and a more interesting story.  Jeremy Irons and John Malcovich were both very good as one would expect.      Many of these negative reviews amaze me, it seems some just criticize because that is what they enjoy doing. Such nit picking! Some complain that it has the usual fantasy themes, clothes, creatures, magic etc of other fantasy films such as Lord of the Rings.  Well of course it does, it is a fantasy film. All fantasy stories have common themes, just as all westerns have common themes. Would you go to a western and be upset that it had cowboys and horses and gunfights? Or go to a Science Fiction film and complain that it had space ships and aliens?  That is a silly complaint to make.    Some complained it was poorly written, well the novel was a best seller and many including myself loved the story.  Yes, I know they left a lot out of the movie, but that cannot be helped, the story took place over a long period, and they had to condense it into less then two hours, although I do feel they should have made it at least a three hours movie to cover more of the story.    One complained that Saphira had the voice of a female.  Well duh, she is a female dragon and has a female personality, obviously never read the books.  I guess that reviewer thought a female dragon should have the voice of Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwartenegger, Geez.    Others complained that it was set up for sequels, well I guess so, it is only the first chapter in the Inheritance Trilogy.  Just as Fellowship of the Ring was only the first chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, neither was ever intended to stand alone as a single story, but the beginning of a story.    Everyone wants to compare this and other fantasy films with Lord of the Rings, and it is unfair to make that comparison.  I can't imagine any fantasy films living up to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but that does not mean they can not be enjoyable films in their own right.      I am not a kid, but have not forgot how to enjoy youthful things, this was not intended to be \\"Gone With the Wind\\", just a fun fantasy film about a magical dragon and her hero rider, and I really enjoyed it.
0767803434|1.0|I like Harrison Ford, a lot.  I grew up with the man as Han Solo & Indiana Jones, but since The Fugitive, can anyone name me ONE decent performance he's been in? Anyone? Anyone? Thats right, he's really not much of an actor.  And shamefully the talented Gary Oldman, Glenn Close,  and Jurgen Prochnow are not allowed to show off their skills.    The plot (Air Force One being hijacked by Russian terrorists) seems easy enough.  However, the linchpin of the whole plot is completely ignored, thereby invalidating the whole movie.  For the terrorist plot to succeed, it is completely dependent on one of the secret service agents to be a traitor.  Did he do it for money? power? sex? a good chocolate milkshake?  We'll never know because they don't bother to mention it!  So we're supposed to accept that a president will run around Air Force One beating up terrorists, but a secret service agent who would have to endure YEARS of training, screening, and background checks would turn on the commander-in-chief with no good explanation?  Also do we really want a president who would consider the life of his family over the well-being of the nation?  I know that sounds cruel, but that's THE JOB!      I do not expect reality from movies, in fact when done right fantasy is a great genre.  However, this movie obviously is trying to have SOME basis in reality.  So if you're going to construct a film that has to have some realistic factors, isn't worth time to review the script to make sure it even makes sense?  THIS is primary point of my critique.        I don't feel any possible political leanings are to be drawn from the film.  You're really supposed to shut your brain off, eat popcorn, and feel good about the ole U.S.A..  So should you want another overly melodramatic, cliched, bad leading man 2-hour crapfest, that's your choice.  Please just don't consider it a good one...

6305127697|5.0|Edward Norton's portrayal of \\"the butcher boy,\\" an altar boy accused of brutally murdering a bishop, is acting at its best (earning him an Oscar nomination and a successful career). Aside from a great story-line and exceptional performances, however, is the portrayal of the legal system. Most \\"law\\" movies ignore the fundamentals of criminal procedure and the rules of evidence.  For example, in \\"A Few Good Men,\\" the witnesses do very little testifying; instead the attorney testifies (that Santiago, the vic, didn't pack anything or call anyone to tell them he was being transferred...etc.) - the rules of evidence forbid such testimony by the attorney. Even so, \\"A Few Good Men\\" is a hollywood blockbuster and is, admittedly, an interesting movie. However, \\"Primal Fear\\" portrayed more accurate court scenes and was still a box-office success (and in my opinion, a better movie for it). Hopefully, other directors and screen-writers will be encouraged by this & fewer will completely ignore the law when creating characters that are facing trial; the court room needn't be just another set...it can be a focal component of a great film (as this movie indicates).
6302561841|5.0|***I have a few spoilers included**** <br /> <br />You know, these are hard times we live in.  The world appears to be caving in, crumpling under the weight of worries: war in the Middle East going on and on, uncomfortable changes in weather patters, corruption in politics.  The news can really get you down and in a funk.  The answer, the antidote: watch Charlie Chaplin.  I kid you not.  I've seen this film before and each time it just reaches into my heart and tickles me till I'm alive with laughter.  Chaplin was a truly gifted comic master with almost no peer except for the much beloved Keaton.  \\"Modern Times\\" is such a masterpiece and it came at a critical junction in film history.  When it was made in 1936, films had already added live speech (Jolson spoke a bit in 1927 in \\"The Jazz Singer\\" and talkies were in full swing by the early 30's.  Chaplin surely knew that the days of purely silent films was at an end.  He rose to the occasion by creating one of the most famous dramatic and comedic masterpieces in all of cinematic history.   <br /> <br />While speaking per se is not what you notice in \\"Modern Times\\", the few speaking parts are funny and used with great effect.  What we do notice is Chaplin's unmistakable and incredible physical humor.  We see how he falls over, how he moves his feet, how he kicks things with deft accuracy with those oversize shoes.  We see him run and skid on the floor.  These are hilarious and typical Chaplin moves.  In one scene he just goes over the top in what must be one of the most sensational moments.  He puts on roller skates and suddenly starts skating around like he has been doing this all his life, showing remarkable ability.  Then he puts on a blind fold and shows off, all the while skating within mere inches of a sharp drop to the floor below.  The effect makes you gasp out loud each time he comes close to falling over.  This is Chaplin at his pinnacle.   <br /> <br />There are many books written about this film and all onecan do is to encourage others to take out, buy it, rent it....just watch and enjoy.  Here is a really great film, written, directed and scored by Charlie Chaplin.  A must own for the serious fan.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|Oh, my God, this movie is like so old, but it is still my favorite movie of all time. Kevin Costner is the knight and shining armor that all girls dream of and Whitney Houston's role is very realistic of celebrities, but by the end, you learn to love her. It is a beautiful love story that made me cry.
B0001ZX0OC|4.0|I watched this last night.  This movie made me feel like I had been beaten up and left on the sidewalk to crawl home.  But, I'm not saying it was a bad film.  Eastwood has hit home runs in the last several outings and he has aged his talents to a finely honed formula that rarely dissappoints.  I am not familiar with the book that this is based on and frankly I don't want to know: the movie was upsetting enough.   <br /> <br />A good drama should move you, should make you feel shaken and this film delivers.  The script is very good, the actors all excellent.  While the film seems to linger just a wee bit too long at the end, it caps off the story without leaving anything unsaid.  Having said this, it also does not tie up every single loose end; we are left to figure it out for ourselves and the ambiguity that this invokes is acceptable. <br /> <br />Sean Penn gives a tremendous performance that is worthy of all the accolades.  Following close to him is the evocative and always disturbing impressions we see in Tim Robbins' character.  The themes of this film are nasty and not for the weak of heart or constitution.  While it is not pleasant these things do happen and the story is told in a believable way.  <br /> <br />While I am a big fan of all the main actors and of Eastwoods movies in general, the depth of pain this film oozes just makes me glad I watched it once and I think I'll take a very long rain check on seeing it again; at least for quite a while.  Angst like this is taken in small doses.  On the other hand, acting at this level rarely happens by such a stellar cast and in such a well orchestrated manner.
0553573403|4.0|George Martin surpasses his peers in the fantasy genre with the first book of the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Game of Thrones.  Martin's prose runs smoothly through the reader's mind without misstep or pause.  Each chapter in the book is dominated by the perspective of one main character, allowing the reader to experience unforgettable events and receive compelling information that would not be possible from a sole character's perspective.  Only a master of narration can successfully employ these multiple perspectives to weave each thread together into a work of art.  Martin is such an author.<br /><br />The novel's unique method of dealing with character perceptions allows Martin to dig deeper into each character, and especially, how each character reacts to the others.  Certain even trivial interactions between characters become extremely compelling when Martin has provided perspectives of each person beforehand.  This develops a successful set up and payoff pattern as the reader watches the characters' reactions to each other.<br /><br />At times I felt uncomfortable with the way Martin described a certain character's appearance or trivial actions (like eating), because it seemed as if he was trying to force me to dislike or like a person before I truly had the opportunity to see what he or she was like.  This device proved especially annoying when a character was described in a way that was meant to disgust the reader, but later on acted in such a way that the reader must re-evaluate the appearance-based perception.<br /><br />The carefully woven plot keeps readers interested throughout the epic sized story, punctuated with memorable events that readers will picture in their minds long after they have finished the book.  However, magic features very little in this particular book, so be warned.  Magical creatures and abilities lie just outside of the main storyline, like the glimpse of an object from one's peripheral vision that disappears upon any attempt to stare it in the face.  Some find this strategy makes the magic more intriguing; other fantasy fans feel they have been cheated.  Better determine which kind you are before jumping into this commitment.<br /><br />A final disclaimer: Quite a few scenes are either sexually explicit or violent in disturbing ways.  Many readers appreciate the fact that, much like Terry Brooks, the author is not afraid to dispose of main characters.  In fact, the deaths of some main characters are some of the most memorable scenes in the book.  I also appreciate the courage it takes to be brutal and realistic to one's characters; sex and violence are a part of life.  However, I personally feel that some details in sexual scenes were gratuitous and unnecessary.  Overall, the reader will find a heavy amount of adult content.  Read it first before handing it to your thirteen year old fantasy bookworm.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones should not be missed by any fantasy fan.  But also, like the best books of any type, Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series is not so tightly defined by its genre that it cannot be enjoyed by any reader.

0316172324|3.0|Second reading from Gladwell, with first one being \\"The Tipping Point\\", naturally. I am almost finished with this book so I might be doing a premature review. The book starts off strong, and captivates your attention from the start - the observations on small details and sub-conscious thinking that goes on in our brain is fascinating. I just wish the experiments listed  were a bit more specific; as in the test environments, and all the control subjects. Sometimes I wonder well, did they look at this scenario vs. that one? I wonder (just slightly) if some of the conclusions might not be a bit premature. It is however an extremely stimulating read. I do like this type of modern pyschology and I do like how well the author writes. I do recommend it.
B000002OX7|5.0|Tracks 9 through 12 will bring you to your knees praying to the Gods of Rock and Roll.  If played at top volume your ears will bleed.  Of course the secret to this album is that EC and Nicky Hopkins put in virtuoso performances but are not credited on the cover. Don't get lulled into the first side but skip over to the second side where Pete Townsend and EC engage in a titanic guitar duel on \\"Don't do It\\", a cover piece that is timeless and must be compared to the three Bs.  I hold it in highest regard as the hotest track \\"EVER\\" put on wax.  This was intended to be the third Rock Opera from the Who but ended up as what has came to be known as the \\"Lighthouse Series\\" or Who's Next.  Simply a fantastic example of what was being produced in those halcyon days.  Excellent reading materials are included in the sleeve that explain this somehow inexplicable music.  5 Stars.  Play in car while driving 100 MPH. <br />
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I had this on VHS for a while so it took me a little while longer to purchase the DVD.  Thank goodness I did because it puts the VHS version to shame.  The special features are incredible; especially the multiple camera angles for \\"Baba O' Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\" the interview with Daltrey, and the solo Entwistle bass tracks for the two songs mentioned above.  The interview with Jeff Stein is also excellent along with the comparisons of the old picture and sound versus the new. The movie itself looks and sounds so much better.  Jeff Stein's commentary is also very good.  The best live performances in this movie for me are \\"Baba O'Riley (best live version),\\" \\"Won't Get Fooled Again (also best live version),\\" \\"Roadrunner,\\" \\"A Quick One While He's Away,\\" \\"Young Man Blues,\\" \\"Sparks,\\" \\"My Generation (from Monterey Pop),\\" and \\"Barbara Ann.\\" <br />The Woodstock performances of \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and \\"See Me Feel Me\\" have great sound but bad camera angles.  Other highlights include watching the band record \\"Who Are You\\" in the studio, the interview footage with all four members together, the \\"Happy Jack\\" and \\"Cobwebs and Strange\\" segments, John shooting Daltrey's gold records, all of Pete's interviews, all of Keith's interviews, \\"I Can't Explain\\" on Shindig, \\"My Generation\\" on the Smothers Brothers show, and whatever else I haven't mentioned.  I could go on for hours.  This is such an amazing movie and my only complaint is that it could have even been an hour or two longer so it could include more footage of the Who live or doing interviews.  However, it is still the best Who DVD available and rightly so.  I hope there will be another Who DVD soon with more classic live footage of the original Who.  If you are a Who fan, this is the DVD to get first.  After that, buy \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" and \\"Isle of Wight.\\"

B000JK8OYU|5.0|Just to reiterate what many have already said on here;  remember, this album is really just the soundtrack for the Cirque Du Soleil show of the same name and the songs were picked and mastered for the visualness (making up a word) of that show.  I think I read someplace that there was never an initial intent to create an album (although I'm skeptical) and that its release was an afterthought. <br /> <br />So keep that in mind when listening to the album as a standalone.  For those who haven't enjoyed the album, try and see the show if you can.   You may STILL not like the album but I'm betting that your perception of it will change a great deal.
B000J10ERO|4.0|After a five-year absence from Earth to explore the ruins of Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth and tries to pick up his life where he left off.  Although Clark Kent's job at the Daily Planet is waiting for him, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is not.  Now a mother, she is also in a committed relationship.  To make matters worse, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and uses its advanced technology to launch his most deadly scheme yet. <br /> <br />Although the film runs too long, I confess I enjoyed every minute of it.  Obviously, 25 years of advances in special effects techniques allow for far more spectacular sequences than the Richard Donner films to which this is an affectionate sequel, and director Bryan Singer takes advantage of them to present some great Superman moments.  His reintroduction to the world by saving a plummeting airplane is a highlight.  Routh and Bosworth aren't able to match the chemistry of Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, but they do a good job and I'm looking forward to seeing them in the next Superman adventure.  Spacey presents Luthor's cruel streak more effectively than Gene Hackman did. <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|A funny story about a dysfunctional family that put aside their troubles to give Olive a chance at the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" title. Olive is a little girl about 9 years old who is positive about winning this title, even though her chances are slim.  The family bands together to overcome their own problems and help her.  It is a very rewarding and funny story.
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|The only reason I'm adding yet another review of this movie is the idiocy of people who keep comparing it to the 1995 miniseries.  Yes, the miniseries was utterly fantastic, but the movie is superior to the miniseries in at least two scenes. <br /> <br />One is the scene in which Elizabeth first encounters Mr. Darcy at Pemberley.  According to the book, Elizabeth is so embarrassed that she \\"scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face.\\"  Take a look at how the two actresses did this scene.  I am confident that everyone will agree that Keira Knightley did a better job.  Jennifer Ehle generally did a splendid job in the miniseries, but this was a rare occasion when she slipped a little. <br /> <br />The other scene is the one in which Elizabeth explains to her father why she wants to marry Mr. Darcy.  The miniseries cuts this scene short from what we have in the book, while the movie shows the whole thing.  Isn't it important to show Elizabeth telling her father what Mr. Darcy had done for the family?  After all, it's a huge weight lifted from his shoulders.  The result is that the miniseries ends this scene with Mr. Bennet looking rather solemn, while the movie, following the book, has him laughing and joking. <br /> <br />And why did the miniseries not give us the full scene?  It's because they insisted on spending nearly a minute and a half - it feels like half an hour - on the double wedding of Jane and Elizabeth.  This is strange because we actually learn virtually nothing about their wedding from the book; in fact, we learn more about Charlotte's wedding than we do about Jane and Elizabeth's. <br /> <br />And this lengthy scene also prevents the miniseries from doing what I believe no version has done so far, namely show the scene in which Elizabeth tells her mother she is marrying Mr. Darcy.  It is such a shame that they didn't do it because the two actresses involved, Jennifer Ehle and Alison Steadman, were so superb.  I hope that the next time this story is filmed, we will get to see that scene. <br />
B000J103PC|4.0|Meryl Streep is the key to this movie, grabbing viewers from the first scene.  The story is fun and would appeal to all, especially those who are assistants to demanding bosses.  Many laughs, with good insight to the special pressures on women at the top.
0618680004|1.0|This book represents a \\"fundamentalist\\" interpretation of science and the natural world. From cover to cover the book is full of flawed arguments presented in a style that might seem credible to people not familiar with the nature of scientific knowledge and its relationship to religion. The author has clearly demonstrated his complete ignorance of religion and inability to understand the way religious people think and the basis on which they build their world view. No wonder that the book has been severely criticized by major scientists of our time. <br />
0920668372|5.0|My friend introduced me to this book a few months ago when my son was just born, and I read it during my lunch break - I had to stop in the middle of reading it because my eyes started tearing up when I thought about my infant son at home and how I couldn't wait to get back to him!  I LOVE the message in this book and hope to keep it until I'm old, and then I can pass it on to him for his children - I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone out there!
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Gwen Stefani has always been a favorite artist of mine, it all started with me hearing \\"Don't Speak\\" in 1996 when No Doubt had just about hit it huge, and I followed her career throughout and loved every moment till now. I was estatic to hear of Gwen's return to music with \\"The Sweet Escape\\" and was glad to get it with no money from my pocket. This is what you call your classic \\"Sophomore Slump\\", it's not the greatest album in the world but there are a few song on it that make it a worthwhile purchase. Gwen really just didn't put enough effort into this release, it's actually quite bland even though it's chock full of crazy and erractic beats, it just sounds like she threw this together and said, \\"I released an album so people will stop bugging me!\\" I know she's a new mom and running her fashion line, but come on! Plus everything sounds like her debut album, \\"L.A.M.B\\" (which was just gooey-good fun!) remixed. Every song sounds like one of \\"L.A.M.B\\"'s songs just with new lyrics and mashed up of music. It's not a bad thing, just not a smart move for a sophomore effort.  <br />Gwen Stefani never had much of a voice but it's a voice that you can listen to and enjoy, and that's not even the problem, it's the music. The music makes this album totally tank. Nothing is outstanding or the least bit \\"Wow! I've never heard that before!\\", it's just generic and horrible hip-hop trip beats.  <br />There are hits and misses with this album but let's look at the upside: <br /> <br />The Good Stuff: <br />\\"Wind It Up\\" got me excited with the release because this song is just pure, unadultered fun with clunky beats and racing strings (though this song sounds like \\"Hollaback Girl\\" rehashed). And with interpolations of the Sound Of Music's famous yodel song it adds a unique touch. Though I had a friend complain about how Gwen was \\"always using classic musicals to back her music\\" and how \\"she needs to stop!\\". It's however you look at it but I find it creative and the music video is justinsane and the perfect companion to this song!  <br />\\"Sweet Escape\\" is possibly the best song on here, it's just like your taking an acid trip by riding on a unicorn over a rainbow and counting stars as you glide. Very pyschadelic like and upbeat fun with blaring horns and keyboards. This song is the most original sounding. Hope this is the next single. <br />\\"Early Winter\\" is stunning and brings out that signature Gwen Stefani flair. It's a dark, driving ballad that features a distant piano and raging guitars. Hope this is released as well.  <br />\\"Fluorescent\\" has a nice skittish beat to it with some good 80's influences sprinkled here and there. Good song. <br />\\"U Started It\\" is another good pick from this set. It has that signature Pharrell sound to it, very 80's slow jam with a dash of hip-hop. I like this song for how it flows and sounds. Nice tune. <br />\\"Wonderful Life\\" is techno-bliss and has a great beat and lyrics to it. Very pulsating and driving. This is how I like my Gwen Stefani tunes unlike these: <br /> <br />The Passables: <br />\\"Orange County Girl\\" has a good concept behind it but a white girl trying to rap about living in Orange County just doesn't pass with me. The beat is not bad but if it had a better concept then it would be better, just that Gwen doesn't come off as the \\"hardcore\\" type. <br />\\"4 In The Morning\\" is \\"Cool\\" revisited, but it's not a bad song. It's kina melodic and upbeat with a slow groove behind it but comes off as B-O-R-I-N-G! <br /> <br />The Horrible: <br />Annoynace rings true with \\"Now That You Got It\\", completely ridiculous.  <br />\\"Yummy\\" is HORRENDOUS!! The worst song on here. Gosh, what an embarassing tune...it's so cringeworthy and just down-right bad.  <br />\\"Breakin' Up\\" is just not good and Gwen once again trying to be a \\"hard-core\\" rapper...ugh... <br />\\"Don't Get It Twisted\\" is trying to innovative with different beats and music styles but comes off as a complete mess! <br /> <br />After the success of \\"Hollaback Girl\\" and \\"Cool\\", Gwen tried to capitalize on them by mixing them throughout this album on various songs and it's obvious. It was great the first time but the second time around is sometimes not always sweeter. Gwen also tries to capitalize on hip-hop by giving it her own twist, which is okay, but do it right. And the worst songs on here are her trying to be a hardcore white girl rapper, if she does without that then possibly \\"The Sweetest Escape\\" could have been better. Caution on taking this \\"escape\\", download the best, skip the worst and wait for Gwen to reunite with No Doubt again for a new album (which they will be doing next year, hopefully!).  <br /> <br />PRESS THE REPEAT BUTTON <br />1.

0142501123|5.0|This is one of the big favourite books with the kids at our playcentre. It is gloriously good humoured, wonderfully illustrated, and very affectionate. It is about an (unamed witch) who is flying along, first she drops her hat, then her bow, then her wand. Each time an animal finds it for her and brings it back - then joins her on the broom. <br /> <br />Then, when her broom breaks in half a dragon tries to eat her, but she is saved by her animals, and they ride off on a 'truly magnificent broom'. Happy endings for everyone all round - well maybe except the dragon who goes hungry. Interestingly, the british version does not have 'witch withou fries' - as fries are the Americanisation  - the British version has 'witch without chips'. I notice there are at least two variations on this cultural difference, and nice to see it - I think the chips one works best, (well it does for me anyway) <br /> <br />Lovely illustrations, bright, clear and colourful. Very likeable characters drawn. The real magic is in the words - it is a rhyming poem throughout and very very clever - nice rhythm and the children can anticipate it well. We use it to act out during our sessions too which the children really love. there is a great deal to do and think about to extend children's learning from this - as well as social lessons (cooperation, good nature, helping your friends).

0373771665|5.0|Venetia is one of the books which shows Heyer's range of ability to create new stories, but also her ability to write light and frothy romances with a dark underbelly, and still seem bright and cheerful. <br /> <br />Venetia is the Heroine of the piece, she lives with her two brothers in a country house in a retired existence, and next door to never-seen nobleman of disreputal reputation. In a set piece (which has been re-written with less success frequently in subsequent novels,) Venetia meets, and is kissed by the nobleman - and this sets off a series of changes in Venetia's own life, and a discovery of just who she is. <br /> <br />The novel bounces along nicely - not as slapstick as some of Heyer's book, but deliciously satisfying read.  <br /> <br />As Patroness of the Heyer list for nearly 10 years, this has proved one of the most popular books (The Grand Sophy is usually the most popular) but Venetia is one of the heroines which members identify with most. She =is strong-willed, independent, and confident. <br /> <br />A fun novel, great characters, a good story, a strong heroine, highly romantic, and good reading - what more can you ask for? <br />
B00005JPGM|4.0|The critics are touting \\"Blood Diamond,\\" directed by Edward Zwick, as one of the best films of 2006 as well as lavishing praise on Leonardo DiCaprio for his performance as Danny Archer, diamond smuggler. The movie is certainly worth seeing. DiCaprio gives his best performance to date-- at least that I have seen-- as he usually suffers from what I call the Hugh Grant Syndrome, never able to be totally successful at playing a grownup. The outrageously beautiful African countryside is in sharp contrast to the unending bloody slaughter that takes place in Sierra Leone as families are either destroyed or left in abject poverty.<br /><br />Although the plot is predictable, the film is ultimately saved by the fine acting. In addition to the performance of DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly as Maddy Bowen, the journalist who makes a difference in Archer's life, is outstanding. Nevertheless, no one comes close to Djimon Hounsou as Solomon, the poor African who finds the pink diamond in the first place. His performance almost justifies paying the outrageous price these days of a first-run movie.
B00005JPAJ|5.0|This is the best I have seen in many many years!  Like Crash, this movie screams out a message that attempts to break or at least penetrate the many barriers of prejudice, ignorance and fear created between different nations and cultures in particular by media reports and world politics. <br /> <br />If you liked Crash then you'd definitely like Babel.  If you find the present state of humankind increasingly worrying then you'll unquestionably enjoy and relate to this movie.  To anyone who has to deal with prejudice and stereotypes on daily basis this movie is very personal! <br /> <br />The directing, cinematography and acting is of very high quality.  The actors were brilliant, starting with the children (both Moroccan and American children) and the Moroccan interpreter (he was so natural and convincing) through to Brad Pit.  I've never been a fan of Pit, but I have to admit his acting in two particular scenes in this movie was superb. <br /> <br />The movie was shot in three different countries that are thousands of miles and cultures apart: Mexico, Morocco and Japan, and it used four different languages: English, Arabic (both Moroccan dialect and Standard Arabic), Mexican and Japanese.  The movie diligently succeeded in conveying a strong cultural flavour of the above three corners of the story. <br /> <br />One very special aspect of the movie is the fact that the two sides of a one single event are not presented concurrently or at the same time.  This is done is so cleverly a number of times in the movie which manipulates viewers' emotions in a way that further serves the overall message.  Very well done! <br /> <br />However, the analogy of Babel, as per the interpretation of some viewers who referred to the biblical story in Genesis, in my opinion, does not fit the course of events in this movie or the message it imparts.  The reason for clash and miscommunication, as implied in the movie, is not the differences in culture or language, rather prejudice, fearand ignorance.  The foreign tourists who travel through a poor desert village only willing to see it from behind the glass windows of their luxury bus and who are hindered by misconceptions, stereotypes and fear.  The Japanese girl and her father, who shared the same culture, yet suffered obvious communication failure.  It would make more sense to me that the title simply corresponds to the idea of living in huge high-rise towers thus increasing the distance and inability to communicate with \\"the other\\", which was repeatedly alluded to in the scenes of Tokyo skyscrapers, the lift ascending higher and higher and the crowds of people and traffic that seemed very small from high above. <br /> <br />The one thing I did not like about this movie is that it was (unnecessarily) graphic and that nudity scenes were too many and did not do much in serving its main idea.  The movie could definitely do without those scenes, which would have made it more accessible to wider a audience. <br /> <br />All in all, Babel is an excellent movie with a timely message!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Absolutely fantastic character development and story plot!  The Captain Malcom Reynolds character is what the Han Solo character was intended to be before George Lucas had an Ewok mental breakdown and started \\"PCing\\" Star Wars to sell more action figures.  However, I understand why the series was canceled and the movie was so hard to produce.  The show wasn't schlock, was much too creative, and was well acted so naturally the TV Land Producers wanted it canceled. <br />So BUY the TV series and the movie (Serenity) and send a message with your pocketbook.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album is for: <br />- people taking their first taste of Metallica <br />- more 'mature' metal fans <br />- 'collectors' of everything Metallica <br />- people just wanting a great-sounding rock album <br /> <br />This album is NOT for: <br />- thrash metal diehards <br />- those who worship RTL and MOP as the Bibles of Metal <br /> <br />Simply, this is the only \\"Best of ...\\" compilation ever recorded by Metallica (if you exclude the recent Videos collection on DVD). So for the uninitiated, this is the only CD you can buy to sample the sound of Metallica through all their years. And in this role, it actually works. It showcases all of the band's greatest hits. And best of all, it's a LIVE album. Metallica was always famous for being THE great live act, and the performance they give here is simply awesome. The challenge of trying to outdo a massive orchestra really seems to lift the band to another level. Ulrich's drums are ferocious. Hetfield really sings his lungs out. The orchestration is superb and compliments the metal well - brining out all the melodic components which make Metallica's music stand out from the thrash metal crowd. This is the kind of CD that if played in a record store would prompt the lay punters to ask 'hey, dude, what's that playing?' and propel some to buy a few records themselves. <br /> <br />Of course, that's also the reason why diehard Metallica fans HATE this album. To them, this is 'Metallica elevator music'. It's thrash turned into pop. It's a sellout. I guess they have a point. If you compare, for example, the 'Battery' and 'Master of Puppets' on this album with their original studio recordings you'll find that the hard, naked agression and violence is turned down a bit. Hetfield no longer rasps his lines venomously, but seems to be making a conscious effort to preserve his vocal cords (he did once lose his voice). Overall, the orchestra does transform the music somehow. It's no longer edgy subterreanean menace - it's now bright and bold and vibrant. The other day, as I was listening to this album again, I suddenly realized what it was about this music that was so peculiar: it sounds like the soundtrack to a James Bond movie ! You know how those scores to the 007 films always seemed to fuse a big orchestral sound with exploding rock ? Well, for better or worse, 'S&M' sounds just like that. <br /> <br />So, at the end of the day, if you are a diehard thrasher who is addicted to power and speed, stay away. If you a more 'mature' member of the headbanging community, then this may just be your cup of tea. I always thought I liked 'classic' Metallica, having grown up as a headbanger through the 80s-90s. Lately, after listening to this album 'S&M' a lot, I went back and played the orginal 'Master of Puppets'. And you know what? In some ways, I actualy preferred some of the stuff on 'S&M'. Maybe I'm getting old. Or maybe my musical tastes are just maturing right alongside Metallica's.

B000JJRIN4|3.0|When I listened to this cd for the first time, I had to turn it off because it actually got on my nerves. However, I have gone back and listened again and have come to love the songs, \\"Early Winter,\\" \\"4 In The Morning,\\" and \\"Fluorescent.\\" I can't listen to \\"Wind it Up,\\" it is a jumbled mess, \\"Breakin' Up,\\" with all of it's repetitions is irritating, and \\"Now That You Got it,\\" is just boring. The remaining songs I like, but I wouldn't miss them if they weren't ever recorded. I still have faith in Gwen, she is incredibly talented and she likes to take risks. But when it comes to taking risks, sometimes they pay off and sometimes they don't. I would say on the whole the risks on this cd didn't pay off.
0465092756|5.0|Firstly I want to give my congratulations to Prof. Woit for his courage in publishing this book, which I presume to be the first one that dismantles superstring theory (SST), like the man in the famous tale saying that \\"the king is naked\\". I say courage taking in account the fact that a Harvard faculty member slandered critics of SST as terrorists and claimed for an intervention of U.S. military. The title of this comment is a joke, taking into account that it is the C.T.U. (Counter Terrorist Unit, from the TV fiction series \\"24\\") that  \\"take care\\" of terrorists and not the Army. I am sure the Harvard professor doesn't consider really Prof. Woit a terrorist, but I think that his statement unveil the   preponderance of the superstring theorists in the universities physics departments. Anyway I believe that \\"the pen is mightier then the sword\\". <br />I am a layman, so I can't say anything about SST, but I think there is some features of the theory that need to be considered in the light of Knowledge Theory.  <br />In Arthur Jaffe's paper \\"Ordering the Universe: The Role of Mathematics\\", SIAM Review, Vol.76, No 4, October 1984, there is a diagram showing the interaction or feedback between Mathematics and Nature. That diagram may be generalised as:  <br /> <br />KNOWLEDGE---guides----> THOUGHT---directs---> ACTIVITY---conditions---> THOUGHT---elaborate---->                          --> KNOWLEDGE   <br /> <br />This feedback between knowledge (or theory) and activity (or experiments) is emphasized several times in the book, but it seems that the superstring theorists ignore it; needing a spacetime of 10 dimensions to explain their theory they are committing the same error (generally speaking) as Hipparcus, the Greek mathematician and astronomer who needed an epicycle to describe the trajectory of the planets. However, there is a difference in that the Hipparcus's method could give approximated results, while SST can't get experimental evidence. Superstring theorists seem to ignore also that the laws describing the planets orbits were discovered by Kepler, using the data about planets compiled by the astronomer Tycho Brahe. As another example of a concept created by the mind of the physicists without any evidence and projected in the Nature as a real entity, I can cite the \\"ether\\", the medium through which the physicists thought that the electromagnetic waves propagate.  <br />Another point I would like to focus is that some physicists are not humble persons, when they hail the SST as a \\"Theory of Everything\\". They forget that, at the end of 19th century, the physicists thought that physics was almost complete, remaining to solve only \\"little\\" problems as the ultra-violet catastrophe and the problem of the speed of light. We know the great revolution that happened in physics, next to the works of Planck and of Einstein about those problems.  <br />To conclude, I would like to refer an analogy between the development of particle physics and the evolution of mathematics. Since the birth of Quantum Mechanics until to the Standard Model, the particle physics has undergone several \\"up-grading\\", each phase of the theory backing up on the previous one. This evolution is somewhat similar to the evolution of mathematics, where we see subjects of high level appearing founded on subjects of lower level.  <br /> <br />

B000J10ERO|4.0|This movie gets plenty of things right but the little kid in peril routine feels very, very old and tired. I also disliked the part of Lois' boyfriend who casually flies planes and lives in a house by the sea, too expensive looking for any non-millonaire (just like Margot Kidder's apartment in the original). The ending, featuring tons of CGI water felt way too artificial also. <br />Still, Routh is perfect for the part and Spacey is great as Luthor. The flying effects make the ones in the old Superman feel rudimentary but after 28 years, that was to be expected.
B000J103YI|5.0|Being a big fan of \\"Dreamgirls\\" over the years, I've eagerly awaited the release of the film version for more than a year.  Fortunately, the soundtrack lived up to the movie's hype!    While Jamie Foxx's take on \\"When I First Saw You\\" was nothing terribly special, the rest of the cast shines throughout the soundtrack.  Jennifer Hudson's voice is amazing in the role of Effie.  Beyonce, Rose, & Murphy are also terrific.      Though a couple of the songs from the stage version have been dropped, all of the primary songs remain intact - with a couple of terrific songs added as well.     Best Tracks include:    Move  Steppin' To The Bad Side  Love You I Do  Dreamgirls  And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going  Patience  I Am Changing  One Night Only (both versions)  Hard To Say Goodbye    Can't you just smell the Oscar nominations coming?
0743298020|5.0|I often try to read modern literature, and then give up in disgust: too sleazy, too gritty, too harsh.  Ms. Setterfield has woven a tale of mystery, dysfunction, and even horror, however she delivers with the elegance that I find so often missing in modern writing.  I was reminded of DuMaurier's Rebecca, of Dicken's Great Expectations, and devoured the obvious references to  Jane Eyre.  I read this fearing I might be wasting my time, and wondering whether Setterfield would win my trust as an author; you never know until the end.

B000IJ79WU|3.0|This could have been a phenomenal attempt to show us all what Richard Donner would have done were he permitted to continue his work on Superman II.  And much of the film was sheer pleasure to watch.  I positively adored every scene with Marlon Brando.  I know some of the other reviewers would differ, but for the life of me, I can't understand why they didn't pay him whatever he wanted.  Of course it would have been expensive...he was after all Marlon Brando.  That's why they hired him to begin with.  For his name.  Although I must say that I did miss Susanah York.  I thought that her scenes in the Richard Lester version were awesome.  But the thing with this version is that there were some very major bad choices made by Richard Donner.  He is obviously consumed with hatred for Richard Lester (he claims to not even remember his name) that he purposely tried to eliminate as much of his work as possible.  I found the opening sequence with clips from the entire Superman 1 movie to be unnecessary.  We all saw Superman 1.  It wasn't necessary to replay the whole move for us.  I can accept the use of screen test footage, even though it was obvious that that's what it was.  I'm sure Donner would have reshot that scene.  So I have no complaints about that.  But the ending is another story.  I know that one of the other reviewers said that he wished we would all stop complaining about the ending, but how can you not complain.  The ending was ridiculous.  To turn back time for a second time is absurd.  I know that's how the movie might have been filmed, but sorry Richard Donner, it was used in Superman 1.  You can't do that sort of thing a second time.  It negates the entire movie.  Now, whenever there's a problem, Superman can always just turn back time.  Why didn't he do that in the beginning of the movie and save a lot of effort?  Richard Lester's ending was far superior, but remember, Donner doesn't like \\"What's his name?\\", so of course he tossed out the Lester ending.  And think about this, if Superman turned back time so far that the three villians are once again back in the phantom zone, aren't they just going to be released again, when the rocket explodes?  And why DID Superman go back to the diner and act as if he'd seen everyone there before?  They wouldn't recognize him because they never saw him before.  I would have gladly given this film 5 stars if it had the Lester beginning and ending and 4 stars if it just had the Lester ending.  But there's no way I can give it more than 3 stars the way it is now.  Maybe they should get Richard Lester to come in and redo this version the way it should be.

068485743X|3.0|Like most books on writing, within The First Five pages, gems of truth reveal themselves amidst the pyrite of personal opinions and fallacies. When reading any book on writing one must remember that like in religion, there is no one true way, and any book will be a compilation of one author's feelings and thoughts on the very delicate subject of selling a novel. <br /> <br />Noah Lukeman, a literary agent, wrote this volume with the intention of helping writers stay out of the rejection pile. He breaks down his work in sections, or layers, of introspection and then goes through from the most basic to the detailed. The belief being that if an author gets to a detailed rejection of the work, then that author is farther along the path the one who was rejection for a more basic, or earlier reason. While I don't find fault with that, wording my critiques in much the same way, I find this work lends itself to being mostly about Mr. Lukeman's personal opinions, the instructional value become blunted when he starts to list when all the exceptions worked. <br /> <br />For example, he indicates that a writer sending a package via FedEx or a method which requires a signature means that the writer cares more about the manuscript and in such will garner a more detailed reading. From Mr. Lukeman, perhaps. But from the rest of the editors and agents out there, many of whom specifically state not to send via any method which requires a signature, it'll garner either a rejection at the shipping office, or a rejection letter. Either one not being the response for which the author hoped. <br /> <br />But, for the reader savvy enough to separate opinions and thought from the gems of writing instruction, there is information to be gleaned from the pages. The writing exercises sharpen the skill, and the commentary on various aspects of writing saleable fiction are interesting. However, genre authors must be careful to realize that Mr. Lukeman appears not to be an agent working to sell genre novels, and as such, will need to keep his sometimes-derogatory thoughts towards genre writing in mind. But, this slim volume, while promising much, delivers very little. <br />
0141301066|4.0|MATILDA is a book about a perfect little girl where every parents would love to have as their own. But unfortunately for Matilda, her parents doesn't really care much of her pressence in the family. That, however, didn't stop her from nurturing herself with self taught skills, such as reading, self grooming, and cooking on her own. Nevertheless the pain of being part of the family that's quite negligence to her well being, and always finding faults to whatever she did, she usually found ways to actually get back at her family. which i much say although they deserved it, don't try it at home kids.<br /><br />MATILDA went to read most of the books in the library on her own, which in turn giving us the list of books we might like to read after this in the future. Once she started attending school, her new set of adventures started. There, she met her new friend, Lavender; a wonderful teacher Miss Honey; and a dreadful principal, Miss Trunchbull who loom a shadow over the children attending that school. Matilda, who's an intelligent young girl, found out she has developed powers of telekenesis while she was in Miss Honey's class in the pressence of Miss Trunchbull. With this, she actually formed an intelligent plan to get rid of Miss Trunchbull for the good of Miss Honey and the rest of the school.<br /><br />This is a funny, cute book but of course I wouldn't recommend letting much younger readers without the supervisons of adults explaining them the moral of actions taken in this story itself, just in case. I pretty much enjoy reading this book. and I would recommend it to anybody who's in search of a good book. The characters are strong and actually easy to follow the plot of the story.
B000E5KUK6|1.0|They made it with decent special effects, a nice jab\ode to Siskel and Ebert, the made godzilla look like an actual creature\animal that could exist....but it's still not a scary as a guy in a rubber suit kicking around model trains and balsa-wood models.
0671027387|5.0|In Deception Point, Brown shows off his writing prowess with a fascinating plot, characterization of believable protagonists and the expertly played dramatic tension overshadowed in his other novels by heavy religious themes.<br /><br />The antagonists in this novel, the Delta team stalking a group of scientist, may be the weakest part of the story. In creating the team, Brown followed a familiar pattern of omniscient, heartless villains with unlimited resources at their disposal. And they are pitted against unwitting, untrained and underarmed scientists. A little hard to believe but Brown pulls off the interactions between the opposing forces with great writing. You will have to suspend belief a little but that's what makes reading a thriller fun.
B00005JOLI|2.0|Unlike the recent fantasy master pieces, this plot is skewed and thin-thin, the only hope the movie had was in an excellent delivery.  Special effect were nominal at best; action was less than that thanks to its PG or child audience.  The dialogue might have been the worst.  The characters delivered there lines all they were reading them off cue cards, often causing the audience to laugh.  As I said, \\"A Kid's Movie.\\"  If you won't notice the bad acting, won't notice the lack of plot, and won't notice the lack of action this is your movie!  Other wise, I'd wait for Night in the Museum.
B000J3FC0Q|5.0|Amy Winehouse has successfully avoided the sophomore jinx.  This album very different sound than her first record \\"Frank\\", but it captures the essence of Amy.  She has managed to re-invent herself.  She marries contemporary lyrics and 50s & 60s melodies quite well.  This is a must have for true music fans.
078322611X|5.0|No matter how many accolades guys get for being \\"sensitive\\" and for being unafraid to show their feelings, no guy willingly lets the world sees him dissolve into Niagra Falls......but Field of Dreams finds our weak spot and pours it on.  Even after nearly twenty years nothing prepares me for \\"Dad.....want to play catch\\". <br /> <br />This is a great movie about a guy who goes against everything (family, economic pressures, his own instincts) to plow under his cornfield to build a baseball field after a mysterious voice tells him to do so.  Soon the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson appears and Ray Kinsella (the farmer) believes the instructions are an attempt to ease the pain of the disgraced ball player.  But the story adds layers of complexity as Ray continues to receive strange and seemingly pointless instructions that soon snare a reclusive writer and another ghost....this time a small town doctor who never found his fifteen minutes of fame as a major leaguer.  Somehow all these threads come together into a moral about redemption and the bond between fathers and sons.  It may seem sappy but the script, direction and acting keep the tone decidedly non-maudlin.  In fact this is one of the few movies where you can tell that all the actors have bought into the film completely.....everyone in the film is clearly having a great time and the viewer can't help but be caught up in the joy. <br /> <br />I've seen this movie several times and it always grabs me.  Whether you're on your twelfth viewing or your first be prepared for a great film.....and make sure you've got that box of Kleenex handy.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|If you watch this movie and don't like it at all, then you just learned something about yourself. This means you're stupid and/or boring. You can find how to treat this in your own way. <br />I hope this helps all those who don't like the movie.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is such a great cd.  I have another one that has almost all the songs this has.  The songs sound different though so it's good.  John Mayer is one of my favorite artists because when I hear his songs I can really think.  The songs will make you feel so good.  This is a great cd for anyone who likes rock or blues.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I saw Kingdom of Heaven when it came out and was immediately taken with Ridley Scott's epic tale.  The story of the film has been well discussed in other reviews so I will mention the 45 additional minutes in this cut.  <br /> <br />I thought that the beginning of the film could use some additional scenes to give the viewer more of a background to Balian, and the new director's cut does just that.  We learn that Balian has been to war and involved in engineering.  We see Balian's wife alive in a flashback and even Godfrey (Liam Neeson) has a moment when he recalls a meeting with Balian's mother.  We also get a brief glimpse of Godfrey's older brother, the Lord of the area, who seems a bit jealous of his brother and his nephew.  It is this nephew who later attempts to arrest Balian.  The most significant addition to the film is Sibylla's young son who is the heir to the throne of Jerusalem.  There is a good deal of discussion about this sub-plot in the accompanying bonus material and it adds significantly to Eva Green's character, creating a much more complex woman when she realizes that her son is condemned to die the slow death of her brother.  With the additional footage in the film one can better appreciate the performance of Ms. Green.  <br /> <br />There are small additions to the film that expand scenes.  For example, one of the grave diggers that is burying Balian's wife at the start of the film shows up in Jerusalem and fights in the siege.  We also have a final duel between Balian and Guy de Lusignan.  A minor addition perhaps but it helps connect Balian to his earlier life and we can observe how the people under siege believe in their leader.  The film was carefully researched and all of the major characters are historical, except for Godfrey but there is not much know about them.  The performances are superb: Marton Czokas is, as always, a marvelous villain, Jeremy Irons is outstanding as Tiberias and Edward Norton is an impressive King Bardwin, just to name a few.  This allows Ridley Scott the opportunity to flesh out his characters (however, we can be fairly certain that Sybella did not have a romantic fling with Balian) while remaining true to their personalities.  The casting of Arab roles was restricted to Arab actors and Ghassan Massoud makes an impressive Saladin and Alexander Siding is very good as Nasir.  There has been a lot of speculation that Ridley Scott had a message about Iraq in mind when making this film but I think the director has been clear that his idea behind the film was to show that the age old conflicts of the Middle East have had their share of good and bad people in every camp.   <br /> <br />This is a visually stunning and beautifully acted film that held my attention from start to finish.  In his Director's cut Ridley Scott has created an epic film worthy of a place among the best.    <br />
B000ICLHIE|5.0|I bought this wonderful set through National Public Radio's music store for $38 plus 2 dollars shipping.  Amazon and Borders were selling it for $40-45 until recently.  I guess there were \\"only\\" 200,000 made.  I'm sure there are still some available at record stores somewhere.  Be diligent in your search if you have to have the book of lyrics and pictures.  DO NOT PAY $80 or more for this set or the \\"Collectible\\" set (not even new!).  These are scalpers trying to rip you off in your rush to get a Christmas gift for someone special. <br /> <br />Instead, get the \\"Digipak\\" which is just a more regular packaging of the exact same, fantastic music of Tom Waits.
0307237699|3.0|At last someone who tries to join americans together instead of tearing them apart. If you did not hear his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, go find it and really listen to him. I hope he is our next President because if this country continues to ignore its citizens, refusing basic human necessities, outsourcing jobs, no health care, and continue the use of illegal immigrants for cheap labor, there will be a new revolution. For what G.W. has spent in Iraq, we could have National Health Care, saved Social Security, and still gave all 300 million of the U.S. citizens a million dollars thus eliminating poverty. Obama's book is very uplifting.
B00005JPCD|5.0|Everyone that has seen this movie has ended up loving it.  All my friends that I recommended to see this movie are now willing to buy it.  There's a lot of dancing, singing, cute and lovely animals and situations that makes you think, how wrong we are teaching our children.  There are some laughs, but that is a plus.  First of all, the movie is not only conceived just for kids, but for adults too, and I dare to say that is more for adults than kids.  The movie is about the acceptance of a penguin (or someone) that is different from the other penguins, and how does it take to make the others see and understand that being different does not mean being bad, but in most cases means being better.   The movie is very touchy about this matter.  On the other hand the movie also has a conversationalist message that makes you realize that all of us are guilty in the way we destroy nature because of our uncontrolled consumerism that is going to destroy us all at the end.  The movie also tell us once again, that we are the ones who have the responsibility for giving a final solution.  WAO!!!...all in this movie, definitively one of the best ones this year, not for superficial people.  The final result is what it counts, and in this movie all the goals were achieved.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Nice! I thought this one could not match my expectation. I never watched this movie before but after I bought and watched it, I personally think this is another one good Disney classic to be put in my dvd library.
B000E5N62U|5.0|I never thought Fagen would top \\"The Nightfly,\\" but he certainly does so here.  Others have rightly pointed out that this is the most \\"Steely Dan-like\\" album from Don and maybe that's its appeal.<br /><br />Just plain good stuff.
B000002A46|5.0|Its very hard to find newer christmas albums with any traditional feel to them. Mariah though does a very very good job of capturing the christmas spirit with a more traditional sound. Kudos to her for a great christmas album. I love to listen to it as it reminds me of christmas as a child.
0740748475|5.0|I am a fan of Calvin and Hobbes for a long time, since when I was a kid and there were daily strips in a local newspaper (Brazil). I have a few of the published books, but this collection is everything a calvinmaniac needs to fulfill its dream. <br /> <br />I am reading the books little by little, savoring it as much as possible, and not wanting to reach the end. Although I am pretty sure that after I actually finish the book, restarting it will be such an enormous pleasure that I won't be able to help but do it. <br /> <br />As a few other buyers have said, the pack is not so friendly to handle, and removing the book from the hard cover is sometimes an exercise of patience, in order not to damage it.  <br /> <br />Anyway, this is absolutely recommended, to people who know Calvin, Hobbes and their universe, and a great gift if you want to introduce somebody to them.
B000I0QK74|5.0|It is worth finding the Hallmark version just to have Deck the Halls. Great CD!
B00003CXQY|5.0|Most people said that this released is trash, pointless and bla.. bla.. bla... I disagree! It's not like other Disney released before but the movie is really funny. That's the reason why I gave 5 stars for this movie and to buyers out there who still do not have and want to buy this, try to get this ultimate collector's edition. Trust me you won't dissapointed.
0060558121|5.0|It's clear there's a lot of passion about this book, with almost 600 people reviewing it to date.  I had an excellent time reading this novel.  The germ of an idea - that Old World gods came to America with immigrants and had to blend into society when their powers faded - was brilliant.  Gaiman pulls off a tour de force with \\"American Gods.\\"  I read virtually the entire book on a cross country plane trip with one layover.  I was actually grateful to have three uninterrupted hours on the ground in Dallas and found a quiet spot to keep reading.<br /><br />The book is long - it's an investment in time - but boy was the trip worth taking.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I adore Sarah McLachlan. Her voice is beautiful, haunting, and extremely emotional, and as a result, \\"Wintersong\\" is an exceptional holiday album. McLachlan's mix of traditional Christmas songs (\\"Silent Night,\\" \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas,\\" \\"What Child is This?\\") and more modern holiday classics (\\"River,\\" \\"Happy Xmas [War is Over]\\") is very refreshing. Even though these are very popular songs that we all know and love, McLachlan brings a new dimension to all of them. Each song is rather melancholy, but not in a bad way...in a very Sarah McLachlan way. My favorite tracks on this album are \\"Wintersong\\" (the title track that McLachlan wrote herself), \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\" (which appears on one of my favorite Sarah McLachlan albums, \\"Rarities, B-Sides and Other Stuff\\"), and \\"Christmas Time is Here\\" (yep, that's the song from \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas,\\" which Sarah performs with Diana Krall).<br /><br />My only complaint about this album is that Amazon took its sweet time shipping it to me, so I didn't get to listen to all these great songs until today...I wish I'd been able to enjoy them sooner! \\"Wintersong\\" has quickly become one of my favorite holiday albums, and if you're a fan of Sarah's or of beautiful music in general, I'm sure you'll feel the same way.
B0000AKY7R|5.0|Warning to fans of classic Santana: this might be a little too jazzy for you.  If you can't stand Caravanserai then avoid Love Devotion Surrender.<br /><br />I totally understand how confusing this cd must have been to Santana's fans when it first came out.  And I'm sure that I would have thrown this in the dumpster if I would have owned it as a teenager.  But as I get a little older I have the patience to really give something like this a chance.<br /><br />And once I gave it a chance the reward was amazing.
0786838655|5.0|I play audiobooks for my kids (ages 10 and 7) on the ride in to school in the mornings, and these books have by far been the most popular! Fast-moving and action packed, the kids screamed in protest every morning when I had to turn it off, and I had to fight the temptation to keep listening without them as I continued on to work... <br /> <br />I have always had a love of Greek mythology, and have tried to read some of it to my kids, but the narratives were too stilted to interest them much, and many of the themes inappropriate. These books do a fantastic job of making the characters and stories of the myths appealing to today's instant-gratification special-effects generation. Ares wears a leather biker's jacket, Hermes shows up in a jogging suit, and Poseidon sits on his throne in a fisherman's cap and Bermuda shorts. Rick Riordan also has a rare talent for finding humor that engages kids without offending adults-- a talent I dearly wish the potty-humored cartoon shows would develop. I thoroughly enjoyed the story as much as my kids did, and we are all waiting in agony for the third installment!
B000JJRIO8|1.0|Tupac watered down. When was the last time any of you heard Elvis release a posthumous duets with Brittany Spears? \\"They\\" would never do that. \\"We\\" are turning \\"our\\" modern-day-soldier into Homey-the-clown. Remember, the battle is NOT flesh and blood. Spiritual genocide at it's finest. God says don't add or take away from His word. I'm sure Pac would feel the same way. Think about it.

B000JLTRJ0|1.0|WTC events that day was not JUST about 2 policemen, but all of us: firemen, people, workers, cops. Movie don't show how brave those firemen were risking their lives.. Its over 2hrs of just 2 cops stuck in the rubble.. Its just like saying United 93 had only 2 brave men to stop the terrosrists..
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I have been listening to Incubus for years. I have listened and loved every album to date. When Light Grenades was released, I had to listen to it a few times to get the full effect. Once I got used to the new sound, I went back and listened to the other albums again and I liked what I heard. The band has done a lot of growing and maturing. Most bands that have been around this long end up having the same sound on every album with a few modifications here and there. Incubus has managed to overcome this and deliver an excellent, refined album with a perfect mixture of their new and old sounds. <br /> <br />In all honestly, if you're an Incubus fan then I don't understand how you can give this anything less than a 4. They sound fresh and new and better than ever. If you didn't like the album, or didn't listen to it yet like some people, then go listen to it a few more times. Take in all that the songs have to offer. If you truly are a fan, you will realize that this is the future of Incubus and it is good. <br /> <br />Songs I loved: <br />Dig <br />Anna Molly <br />Love Hurts <br />Light Grenades <br />Diamonds and Coal <br />Rogues <br />Pendulous Threads <br /> <br />The rest of the songs sound good, but I couldn't get into them as much. Listening straight through the album I get the kind of feeling I would want from Incubus.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember hearing about the Firefly TV series but was so disenchanted with television in general during the time it aired that I stayed away from the tube. Serenity, the feature film based on the Firefly series, came out after the series was canceled and received so much critical acclaim as a sci-fi/western flick that I had to see it without seeing the TV show. I was amazed! It is one of my favorite movies of any genre.  I assumed that Josh Whedon & Co. upped the ante for the feature film. So while my curiosity was aroused about the TV show, my expectations weren't that high...I was wrong. <br /> <br />The quality of the Firefly T.V. series is just as outstanding, if not more so, than the movie. Interesting, well-developed characters portrayed by great actors, engaging plot, suspenseful action sequences, and awesome special effects make this perhaps my favorite TV series. As other reviewers so rightfully stated, if you're sitting on the fence on this one, jump off and enjoy the ride. Firefly/Serenity will compensate you for the disappointment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. See why Firefly is still highly ranked on Amazon.com more than 2 years after its release.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|What an outstanding movie - especially when you consider the making of it.  Tom Hanks is the base for several characters and the annimation is splendid.  I had just seen the movie this year and the purchase of our own copy was a must!  Our 3 yr old loves the movie and in no way found it frightening (though I can see how it could be frightening if you have the surround sound cranked up and a 150\\" t.v. placed 5 feet in front of the child).  A family movie that offers magic, suspense, excitement and joy.  Loved it.  Just loved it.
B000JVT092|3.0|If you are looking for true HD you better stay away from this title the transfer is horrible, at times it looks like 480p not 1080p, better check the Blu-Ray version or even buy the Standard Def DVD.
0307277887|2.0|If you want a quick and easy crime read, then you should enjoy \\"Dexter\\".  However, if you are looking for a skillfully crafted, plot twistin' good time, move along.  Once the \\"serial killer that kills serial killers\\" idea sets in the story drags and lacks the depth it needs to make you want to read more.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I never write reviews so you can imagine how much I enjoyed this movie since I am actually taking the time to write a review. <br /> <br />I don't remember exactly how I got hooked on this movie. I think I must have caught pieces of it on television but I do remember borrowing it from a friend and I loved it. Why do I love this movie so much?  <br /> <br />It's heart warming, it's romantic but not mushy. It's a different twist to Cinderella. For starters Cinderella is an intelligent and well read young woman, there's a nice step sister as well as a mean one and Anjelica Huston is amazing. She is a wonderful actress; her facial expressions are hilarious.  All three women will appeal to different viewers. <br /> <br /> There's over 800 reviews telling you how good this movie is; it is definitely worth the money and it deserves to be in your collection. I bought my copy the moment I had some cash available. I never regretted it and you won't either. And I guarantee you'll watch it more than once!  Happy viewing. <br /> <br />
B000GRUS22|3.0|I think mr. Cretu have enough talents and music idies to  <br />produce the Enigma music we all liked before. I can feel it when listening to sitting on the moon and good bye milky way.  <br />I remembered the child in us when listened to sitting on the moon. <br /> <br />I think if Enigma had to be updated, it should be Enigma and not another music style changes every 3 years.  <br /> <br />I still listening to earlier Enigma albums hunderds of times without a proplem repeating the music. but i don't think  <br />VOYAGER or A POSTERIORI <br />a kind of albums live so long, the music will die after listening several times. <br /> <br />listening using headphones or listening several times and listening with good sound system to judage on the album is not the way we used to appreciate enigma before.  <br />I'm absolutely sure mr. Michael Cretu still able to produce more than he produced before in the earlier albums <br />with all the music technology update since 1991. <br />Imagine how wonderfull the album will be if enigma mixed with new  <br />music technology discovered by the last years.  <br /> <br />some parts of the music remembered me with Jean Michel Jarre. <br /> <br />using low and hi frequency modulation to emulate the space is not agenius idea (in my opinion only). <br />Enigma success curve going from up to down. <br />Mr. Michael Cretu please don't hide your talents from your fans . <br />

0307237699|5.0|By senior year in high school students have been exposed to the history of this country. This book should be mandatory reading in either Civics or Humanities. It is both a review of history and a future looking piece of fine literature. Perhaps a few teachers should read it,also!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I must admit, when I first saw it, I was critcizing everything. I didn't like the actor they chose for Mr. Darcy, I didn't like Keira as Elizabeth. There were also some aspects of the play that irked me- technical things; things the character wouldn't do. Of course, I realize that it has been a few years since I thorougly read Pride and Prejudice but as the movie continued on I began to enjoy it.  <br /> <br />I found the actor who played Mr. Darcy very attractive. I loved the costumes, the music, I thought the acting was good and lo and behold, I loved the movie. I cannot stop watching it. I enjoy trying to catch the little mannerisms of the characters and the looks between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The more I watch it the more I realized that I was wrong about Keira- she was really good in this. <br /> <br />I can understand why many people may not like it. There are some movie adaptations based on some of my favorite books that I hated. Am I a purist? No! but sometimes you just want the movie to catch the magic of the book and I'm starting to realize that it can't happen. That's why you can always go back and read the book. It's more fulfilling when you can envision the characters yourself. <br /> <br />This movie is not for everyone, Austen fans or not. I never seen the Colin Firth version but now I want to. I forgot how much I loved Jane Austen and I thank this movie for reminding me. I'm rereading the story now. All I have to say is, just rent it first or watch it on HBO since they're showing it now. It doesn't hurt to try it and then make the decision. I enjoyed it, i thought it was good. I have not seen all of the versions so I can't answer which one is better. <br />Of course there were some differences between this and the book. But I think it's good enough to recommend to others. I had my misgivings at first but I took the chance and watched it and now I love it. Take a chance, it's not bad.  <br />
B00004Z400|5.0|With the inclusion of `Mini Maggot', `White Pony' was re-released to the public a more complete album.  It's not that `White Pony' wasn't near perfect already, it's just that any extra song that's `NOT' filler is always welcome.  `Mini Maggot' starts off the album with a classic Deftones `rap/rock' feel, but it's with `Felticeira' to me that the album becomes it's own, giving us a new eerie mellow rock vibe that Deftones have since perfected.   <br /> <br />Songs like `Digital Bath' (about committing suicide with a toaster in a bathtub...I'm not joking, Chino said this) and my personal favorite `Passenger' featuring Tool's very own Maynard prove to be some of the most intelligent tracks released in music today, lyrically and musically pushing the envelope and delivering another side of this band, a very welcome side.   <br /> <br />Songs like the brilliant first single `House of Flies' and `Street Carp' serve up some awesome head banging catchy riffs and lyrics, while `Elite' proves that Deftones still have MAJOR edge.  `Teenager' and the closer `Pink Maggot' are soft spoken and delicate, much different than anything we've heard from this band before, and they further go to show that The Deftones are the definitive band of our generation, probably the most influential and inspired bands to come along is a very long time.   <br /> <br />Lyrically this album is fantastic, casting shadows and ambiguous thoughts around effortlessly.  Just listen to `Passenger' (from which the title of my review is taken) or the brilliant `Knife Party' and tell me you're not spellbound!  One of the greatest albums ever released, Chino and the boys never fail to impress me over and over again.
068485743X|5.0|Whether you write fiction, letters, marketing copy, or anything at all that you hope people will read, you need to buy, read, re-read, and then read this book again!<br /><br />Lukeman nails it. We live in a headline society, and we are overwhelmed by too much information. How many of us own a slew of books we intend to read but haven't gotten to? How many books have you picked up and then put back down because they were \\"ho-hum\\"?

0671027344|5.0|This book is about a teenage boy named Charlie who writes letters to an unknown person. They are random letters about his life and what he is experiencing. He talks about a lot of things that teenagers experience today. This book confronts experiences with alcohol, drugs, sex, relationships, homosexuality, and lessons that many people don't want to talk about; lessons about living life while you can, lessons that every teenager has experienced. Even adults who experienced teenage years recently or long ago can relate to this book. Charlie looks and shows life through his eyes. This book is brutally honest and is one of the best books I've ever read. <br /> I loved this book because it was honest. Not many people can be that honest, but this book explains things in ways that make you really think. This book talked of love, of living, and of dying. It talked about controversial things, and ordinary things. Some people are afraid to be as honest as this book is. Some people may think that teenagers don't need to know everything or have things like sex described in such detail. But the majority of teenagers already know what this book is talking about. It just talks about it in a new way. <br /> One thing that could've been better about this book was in a chapter they handled one issue and then dropped it. Some say that's a good thing and others say it's a bad thing. I think that it's not such a good thing because things need to be mentioned more than once for the effect to really sink in and mentioning it in only one chapter of letters is not enough to really get you thinking unless you read it a chapter a night or every week. It is different if you drop it but mention it, but when they dropped the subject they dropped it and if mentioned maybe mentioned once in something completely unrelated. <br /> Although that one thing I did not like the honesty of this book made up for it and I recommend this book to anyone who has ever experienced life. And if you haven't experience life, you should read this book. It will open up your eyes and it makes it all the more important to experience life. This is an amazing book. <br />
B0000009RX|5.0|Some of this album is snarky, hilarious satire (Who Needs the Peace Corps?; Flower Punk; Absolutely Free; the Idiot Bastard Son), some of it's unabashed, unironic protest singing (Mother People; Concentration Moon; Mom and Dad; What's the Ugliest Part of Your Body?; Take off Your Clothes When You Dance), some of it's comic relief (Harry, You're a Beast; Let's Make the Water Turn Black), and some of it's more avant-garde (Are You Hung Up?; Hot Poop; Nasal Rentetive Callipoe Music; The Chrome Plated Megaphone of Destiny), but every part of this forty minute suite (pretty much what it is) is unadultred brilliance that'll make your head spin. The best Zappa album out there, at least out of what I've heard.
0399241523|5.0|After being shot in Scorpia Alex lies awake in the most exclusive hospital in all of Europe. With the son of one of the richest men in the world right beside him. Alex should have known something was up but he didn't. After saving the boy and battling four eco terrorists Alex gets kidnapped, not knowing why they wanted him made it even more terrifying. Alex then finds out they are trying to stop the launch of ark angel a luxurious hotel in space, made by Nikolei Drevin the father of the boy Alex saved. In there attempts to kidnap and ask for a ransom the eco terrorists find out it's not Paul, Drevin's son. After knowing this the eco terrorists don't care weather this boy lives or dies so Alex has to make an incredible escape to save his life. After his spectacular escape Alex is invited by Drevin to an island of the coast of the United States with Drevin thanking him for saving his son. Little does Alex know this is all a plot to...? <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book every time I picked it up I knew something exciting was going to happen. Every time Alex is captured he finds some amazing way to escape. It will be a truly sad day when I read the last Alex rider book. I think anyone who likes to read will love this book, its full of action, cool stunts, and a little mystery, but if you don't like to read it will be the same as any other book you read, boring. I really enjoy Anthony Horowitz's style of writing you never know what's going to happen next. If you do want to read these books, you have to read them in the order they come out you can't skip around in the series it will just ruin it for yourself. <br />
B00008NGHI|4.0|The sound is great! A very well recorded SACD. Music comes from the front speakers and the crowd noises from the rear. Not necessarily my type of music but since it is so well done I find myself listening to it on a regular basis.
0345451325|5.0|This book starts with the training of six year old children on the planet Reach in order to create the ultimate warriors known as the SPARTANs. The story then continues to eight years later where John 117, the luckiest and the leader of the SPARTANs, and the rest of the children who made it out of training undergo an augmentation. <br /> The main character in this book is John, also known as SPARTAN 117. He was Chosen as a child to become a weapon to protect the Human colonies in the emergency of a civil war. Although he was never the strongest, fastest, or smartest; he was the luckiest and a natural leader, learning early never to leave any team mate behind. He is ordained the title of Master Chief. <br /> I liked this book b/c it is full of action and suspense. There is also great detail that makes the book seem to come alive. The storyline is great, and intertwines with the game to reveal things you never knew just by playing the game, such as that there are other SPARTANs which the game makes you think there has only been one. It also allows you to know the characters in greater depth then ever before. <br /> There is little about this book I did not like. One of the few things would probably be the length, though it was barely noticeable since I could not stop reading it. It is also a little complex and uses military sayings with out explaining them. But overall, I loved this book. <br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who has played Halo and enjoyed it. I would also recommend it to anyone interested in the military or science fiction and space. This book ties several interests together, making a seamless storyline. That is all. <br />
B000CFLFX4|1.0|I got a box with no instructions. I put it together as it appeared in the picture. As I was snapping on the main piece that connects the handle to the vaccum piece the cheap plastic snapped. I am trying to hold it together with tape! Hopefully, I'll get my money back! Do NOT buy!
0060012234|5.0|Geography Club is about a sixteen-year-old high school student named Russell Middlebrook who happens to be gay. He goes to Goodkind High School, and feels terribly alone, until he discovers another gay teen online that also goes to Goodkind High School. He does what may or may not be considered unwise, and meets the mystery teenager at a local park. Russell is shocked to discover that the gay teenager from the Internet is none other than Kevin Land, the local jock extraordinaire. Soon afterward, Russell makes the decision to tell his best friend Min about his homosexuality. He is dealt another surprise when Min reveals to him that she is, in fact, bisexual, and even has a girlfriend. This leads to a chain of events that bring a number of friends together who, under the reluctant leadership of Russell, create a geography club. However, it is a geography club in name only; it is instead a kind of support group for bisexual and gay teens disguised as a geography club. Things run along smoothly, and Kevin and Russell even start a relationship. But then an unwelcome visitor appears; someone actually wants to join a real geography club, which to its creators was unthinkable. Russell is left with the decision whether or not to allow this person to join, which greatly strains Russell and Kevin's relationship. Then the entire school finds out that Russell is gay after he refuses to have sex with a girl, and his world is turned upside down.  <br /> <br /> This book is definitely one of the best I have read, and is not one to be passed up. It accurately describes the average gay teen's life, and should be read by not only gay teens, but by anybody who wants a true outlook on the life of a homosexual teenager in today's society. It is for that reason that I heartily recommend this book to anybody who is capable of reading, because no other story has the absolute power to invoke raw emotion in the souls of readers quite like Geography Club. So go out and read it. No one's stopping you. <br />
0060589280|5.0|...by the collected works of Brazilian author Paulo Coelho. He seems to have hit a certain note in his writings that promises to ring true forevermore. His is not a linear style, folks. ELEVEN MINUTES: A NOVEL is not a formulaic novel of \\"first this happens, then that happens, then something else happens.\\" You can jump into any part of this story and basically live life at its finest. Life at its most complex and inscrutable and pleasurable--the pleasure within the deep pain, do you know what I'm talking about? Coelho writes his meandering tale as the game of life itself generally occurs: it has twists, stops, starts, and all sorts of gaps in between. Things don't stop when they're supposed to stop. Things don't start where they're supposed to start. And matters also don't proceed according to plan. Rarely will you notice that what is supposed to happen, happens. Here's a good analogy: think of how your mind works at the best of times, how it assaults you with mile-a-minute calculations and considerations. Imagine how you run your typical day, and the process via which you go about making decisions.<br /><br />It's never a straightforward process, is it?<br /><br />One moment you can be lolling in the doldrums, without a clue, then something can smack you in the face and make you wonder just how deeply you'd managed to slip into that funk of yours, feeling sorry for yourself, imagining where you can take the first exit to Check-Out-of-Life Land, buying yourself a one-way express train ticket to hell...then you suddenly realize it was all a Grand Test, papito. That there was more to it, and the Great One, Whomever It May Be For You, was merely pressing your corporeal buttons, wanting to see how much you can take. To basically see what you're made of. To see if you can walk the walk as well as you tell your friends how godfearing and believing of a person you really are.<br /><br />There were some of the thoughts that were racing through my mind, Indy500-style, as I blew through page after excellently-translated (from the Portuguese) page of Coelho's latest installment.<br /><br />Coelho's example in life further indicates to me that some of the best scribes and novellists on this planet are the ones who have stared the face of Hell dead in the eyes, and have lived to tell the tale. The ones who have managed to face down their most dastardly demons, and who have the scars, the tattoos, the breast implants, the Botox, the piercings, and the expensive quick-fixes to show it. Not to mention the thousand and one lovers (paid or otherwise). The ones who have dared to \\"go there,\\" against all the odds and conventional wisdom...who'd one day decided to cast their lot in with the Fates, not caring for that one very moment whether or not they lived or died or say the next bowl of weeties in the morning.<br /><br />Because it's there, on the cusp of such indecision, where the fruits of the vine can be deliciously picked. It's there, where you can feel the gusts of hot backwind gushing up from the abyss, drawing you downward with their complex convenction currents, that you--so mortal and so very afraid--are unable to resist its powerful yank, Frank.<br /><br />Know this, my dear readers...some of the best (and therefore the most successful people, from a lifestyle standpoint, which also generally equates to the \\"game of life\\" standpoint) in the world are the one who've faced down such adversity. I'm not surprised that someone like Maria was able to overcome her fears, and overcome her provincial inner-jungle background to achieve the very best of what there was in life in a land where people from the outside are shunned with as much love as a bout of the stomach flu. I believe this is also the dream of many city dwellers, those who were born and raised in large metropolises, to be able to come to the aid of their families...it's a romantic notion indeed. I salute people like Maria.<br /><br />In fact, the best experience is the one you engage in and create all by yourself, not the one which is handed down to you third-hand. Those are the people we drool over, the ones who populate the pages of some of our best novels, the ones who form the bases of our most memorable fictional characters, the ones who cause films and books to climb to the tops of the bestseller charts.<br /><br />But where do these people come from? I say to you, friends, that they breathe and live. They TRULY exist.<br /><br />Rolf is also quite true to form. In our age of rapid advancement, with cheaper airfares, plentiful business opportunities to deceive and be deceived, massive advances in technology which continue to set us apart from one another, the fact that someone can become burned out with life at such an early age (in their 30s) is really possible. Godhonest. That Rolf is looking out for something totally different, and that he finds his passion and solace in Maria...someone so lambasted by the mainstream and the System...we shouldn't be in the least bit alarmed. Artists go looking for their daily inspiration (which for them is their daily bread) in all the so-called darkly mysterious places. They go digging into the muck to pull out the pearls, and sometimes the muck is more than six-feet deep, the metaphor being a significant one, Jack.<br /><br />I'm sure any one of us who have enjoyed this particular novel have met more than our fair share of Rolfs over this lifetime, have we not? If you haven't, then it's coming, toots. When you meet your potential Rolf, please don't judge him too harshly...<br /><br />In all--and as I haven't read the other reviews on this site, though I'm sure they're all, for the most part, complimentary to the author (and rightfully so)--I'd have to say that each and every one of us is going to derive something different from our reads. We're going to zero in on the thing which pulled most stridently at our heartstrings, and overemphasize, perhaps, that which others might find somewhat trivial. I can give you examples, but you've got other books to read, have you not?<br /><br />No matter.<br /><br />There's enough inside the pages of this book to tease and tickle almost any human...regardless of gender, regardless of nationality.<br /><br />Coelho does it again, and in this way I feel that he's truly gifted with something that he was born to do. It's such a sweet sensation reading a piece of literature which rolls off the fingertips of the greats.<br /><br />I can't wait for his next cut.<br /><br />Hand on the heart,<br /><br />ADM from Praguehe one you engage in and create all by yourself, not the one which is handed down to you third-hand.

B000JBXXZ4|2.0|This record is even worse than Crow Left of the Murder. The songs are slow, or boring and nothing really stands out. Incubus is nothing more than a pretentious rock band who after a couple hit albums (Make Yourself, Morning View) have done everything in their power to NOT have a hit record again. There's nothing wrong with having some commercial appeal is there? If they keep making records that noone wants to listen to they will lose their record contract and the band will be over. Light Grenades had the biggest second sales dip in billboard history! It dropped from 1 to 37. Some incubus fans are so fanatical they like ANYTHING that incubus does. I just think its so pompous to ignore your fans by making weird records just to look \\"cool\\". Its sad when the only people that like your albums are music critics. I'm so over this band.
0440180295|4.0|OK I guess.  Really readable and I can't explain why.  Kind of a mix of Catcher in the Rye and the Time Traveller's Wife.  Antiwar?  I suppose.  War sure seems to suck regardless of whether Vonnegut says so or not.  So it goes.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|These were the type of emotions that I had felt watching this movie. I have never was privilaged to view so much drug use in my life, but I was not a club kid. I was facinated to see the life of a club kid protrayed in such an honest way if this is the life it is. I felt very sorry for the people that were involved with each other and thier tattered, addicted lives. I am giving this movie 4 stars for the honesty and the acting of the actors in a way that it was believable.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|That was the tagline for \\"Superman II\\" When it premiered in 1980 overseas, then 1981 when it premiered in America. The Richard Lester cut of this film was the one seen in theaters at the time, and was a great movie for its time, but it was not the true vision Director Richard Donner had brought to the screen. Donner was fired off production of this movie after a disagreement with the producers. He had already shot 80% of this movie during the same time the original \\"Superman\\" was being shot, so his vision went unseen for years. Marlon Brando had also shot some unused footage for this film, but was not featured in the Lester cut because of budget constraints. Now, more than 25 years later, Donner's cut has arrived, and it is spectacular, and not jokey and gag-filled like the original cut is. It is crisp, clean and wonderfully restored to DVD. The movie itself is quite entertaining, and having both cuts of this helps me to study better the true differences between the two. I will not give away too many details of the differences (those can be seen elsewhere in other reviews and also all over the 'Net), but I did enjoy this much better than the original cut. As far as I'm concerned, the only \\"Superman\\" movies you need in your collection are \\"Superman: The Movie,\\" \\"Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut\\" and \\"Superman Returns.\\" Thank you, Warner Brothers, for allowing this film to see the light of day.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|This is one of those cds you have to listen to more than 2 times before you can judge it critically.  Just like her last cd, it's a mixed bag of dance, r and b, and alternative \\"new wave\\".  Let Gwen Stefani be Gwen Stefani.  She's funky, she's real and she knows how 2 funk it hardcore.  M' favourite tracks are: Four In Tha Mornin', and Flourescent.  Ironically co-written and produced by Tony Kanal of No Doubt.  The rest of the tracks are awesome you just gotta give em a chance.
B00005JKES|5.0|It was only a few months ago when I bought this one amazon for just over 20 dollars. Now it's become so hard to find that it's selling for over 200 hundred dollars from most sellers (including myself). So if you don't have a whole lot of money I'd say wait, check out fire walk with me, or the pilot in the meantime. Ok now for my review. <br /> <br />Twin Peaks was an amazing television program that influenced most television that came after it, and other strange sources as well (such as the thrash metal band anthrax who wrote the song black lodge with a musician who worked on the show and featured lyrics about the show, or the video game silent hill which takes it's signature sign fro the show and it's basis on a small town gone wrong, but I digress).  <br /> <br />The plot of the show is hard to describe briefly the main story is about the murder of a young girl named laura palmer and detective dale cooper assignment to find her killer. From their it spirals of into subplots upon subplots each about a member of the town. You get to see all of the nasty details the town has to offer; blackmail, drug pushing, spousal abuse, secret societies, etc. It's all a crazy ride which lead you to not one, but several cliffhanger endings. <br /> <br />I'm interested to see what happens next. I have not yet seen the second season. Hopefully they'll release it soon, as well rerelease this season so people won't have to spend hundreds to watch a good show.
B000FPX0FW|5.0|I heard her at a concert in New York that was shown on Direct TV and knew that I had to get the CD. I love her voice and the way that her band and back-up singers allow her voice to shine through and not cover it up or drown it out. I have told everyone about her and how they should also get her CD for themselves.  <br />Her voice is so clear and crisp and beautiful, I just love listening to every nuance of the notes that she hits. <br />Her mellow, soulful, bluesey, slightly jazzy style is something new and different that has been a long time coming but well worth the wait. She will be going places, everywhere!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Gosh... where to start, other than to say that I love this movie!<br /><br />Yeah, it's complicated by a whole raft of story lines, subplots and an incredibly large cast.  But it works, with the type of charm that most movies can only hint at.  True to it's premise, Love Actually highlights love in so many varied ways that it's difficult to fully appreciate it with only a single viewing.  This is a DVD that deserves to be purchased, kept and watched year after year.<br /><br />If there is such a thing as an R-rated Christmas classic, this is it.  Yes, there is some nudity, language and a lot of adult themes sprinkled around, so Love Actually isn't the type of movie that you want to break out after the family finishes opening gifts (unless your elderly aunt has fallen asleep in the barcalounger and the younger set is too busy with their new GameBoys to be aware of anything else).<br /><br />Besides having the common thread of \\"love\\", all of the stories feature characters with direct, tenuous or happenstance connections that manage to hold everything together.  There is the aged rock star (Bill Nighy) promoting his trashy treacle of a Christmas song, along with his long-suffering manager.<br /><br />Meanwhile, after discovering his girlfriend's infidelity, mystery writer Jamie (Colin Firth) retreats to France where he falls under the spell of his housekeeper Aurelia (the soulful L&uacute;cia Moniz).  Their budding connection is highlighted by the subtitled dialog since he speaks only English and she speaks Portuguese.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is newly widowed, coping with his grief while helping his stepson Sam (a kid named Thomas Sangster who will make the pulse of every 12 year old girl race, and every mother's heart melt).<br /><br />Then there is Emma Thompson, the sister of the newly elected Prime Minister, balancing children in the Christmas Pageant case - her daughter is the \\"first lobster\\" -  with her attentions to her husband, Alan Rickman who is the target of a predatory seductress.  And her brother the PM (Hugh Grant) has eyes for the new domestic employee at Number 10 Downing Street (Martine McCutcheon).  Of course, Billy Bob Thornton as the US President has more lascivious thoughts regarding her, so that might complicate things a little.<br /><br />But that's not all!  Laura Linney pines over her coworker (they both work for Rickman) Keira Knightley plays a lovely newlywed who isn't aware that her husbands best friend is head over heels in love with her himself.  Oh, and lest I forget, there is the actor and actress that meet while filming a porn movie (told you there was nudity).  And a young man frustrated by his inability to hit it off with the local women, pursues his dream of meeting uninhibited American women by flying off to Milwaukee!<br /><br />Rowan Atkinson also provides two brief but critically important scenes as a jewelry salesman with a decidedly unhurried manner.  And for the shallow-minded males of the family, there are cameo appearances by Claudia Schiffer, Elisha Cuthbert, Denise Richards and Shannon Elizabeth.<br /><br />Is that enough for you?  It darn well should be!  There are a few construction flaws in the whole thing, primarily with the timeline of events being artificially compacted into the five weeks before Christmas, but the overall charm and the collection of winning performances cancel any complaints you might have in that regard.<br /><br />One final note.

0938045695|5.0|For a long time I have wanted to purchase Pavel's book on kettlebells, but honestly some of the reviews scared me away.  I thought that I would purchase a 30 dollar book and have it end up being a commercial for other products, kettle bells etc., and figured that I could find out everything I wanted to know on the web. <br /> <br />However, as part of my new years resolution, I wanted to start using kettlebells.  I purchased a pair of kettlestacks, and decided to get Pavel's book, and honestly, I feel silly resisting for so long. <br /> <br />Pavel's book is excellent.  There are plenty of full color pictures to guide you along.  His writing is punchy and entertaining.  He does a great job of getting you excited about working out. <br /> <br />However, the real selling point are his exercise descriptions.  These are textbook examples of the way you should explain an exercise.  Clear, detailed, never confusing, from reading his descriptions I really learned how to perform new movements. <br /> <br />Is the book pricey, maybe.  But I have scoured the web and read just about anything you can find on kettlebell exercises.  This book has infomration in it that you cannot find anywhere else, good information, and information that is presented in an entertaining fashion, something rare in the exercise world. <br /> <br />Some reviewers have knocked Pavel's book because it is about kettlebells, and they seem to feel that the bells are not worth the time or trouble.  I have now tried kettlebells and Pavel's program and attest that these are the real deal.  You cannot duplicate the kettlebell movements with dumbells.  The offset weight forces your shoulder and core to stablize every movement and the results are phenomenal. <br /> <br />All in all, I think this book was outstanding and recommend it to anyone interested in kettlebells, or exercise in general.
B00000HZH7|4.0|though most people touched on this cds relevence and its influence, most dont realize that these guys were like 16 and 17 when it was recorded! In fact, some couldnt tour because they had SCHOOL! funny when i think about it.<br /><br />The cd itself is just great. Dark, rifs are monstrous and production \\"in your face\\". The remaster sounds better than the original..<br /><br />Lyrically, its a little simplistic, but remember, at the time not many bands were doing this sort of thing, and they were in high school for gods sake!'<br /><br />Great cd for a great time in metal music history! Buy if you like thrash/death metal 80's style. Too bad they didnt record more dark music, as the cds after this were more streamlined. Enjoy!
B00065MDRW|4.0|This is an absolute monster of an album.  It begins with the haunting cover of a face screaming in fear.  It continues with the liner notes which credit Peter Sinfield as a member of the band for \\"words and illumination,\\" even though he does not play an instrument other than his mind.  His dark disillusionment and visionary lyrics permeate the album much his vision later did with Emerson Lake and Palmer.<br /><br />The music starts with 21st Century Schizoid Man.  It is as if the firghtened screaming face on the front cover is transformed into a piece of acidic metal rock, well before there was such a thing as \\"metal\\" rock.  Lyrically, it is paranoia incarnate.  However, like the rest of the album, the lyrics have a second level that not only are we insane, but our society and its institutions are likewise mentally off balance:  \\"Blood rack, barbed wire, Politicians' funeral pyre, Innocents raped with napalm fire, 21st Century Schizoid Man.\\"<br /><br />In what amounts to a musical oxymoron, 21st Century Schizoid Man is immediately followed by the etherical disillusionment of \\"I Talk to the Wind.\\"  The lyrics are of one man's silent, internalized, stuffed, impotent and ineffectual attempts to communicate his ideas and feelings.  They are expressed by the refrain: \\"I talk to the wind.  The wind does not hear.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|It's always a troubling issue when your \\"new favorite band\\" changes their sound.  However, this issue is much less troubling than the potential release of carbon copy work based on the tunes that initially endeared them to you.  Whether a band can navigate this delicate issue is a testament to their talent and vision.  For example, Oasis was never able to recover from the sonic delicatessen that was \\"What's the Story, Morning Glory?\\" and despite the greatness of that album, their fame ended up being of the infamous \\"fifteen-minute\\" variety.  On \\"Black Holes and Revelations,\\" Muse's made a decisive yet subtle sonic shift, and one that is not as pervasive as some critics would have you think.<br /><br />Thanks to reviews, I had mentally prepared myself for this possible shift in Muse's sound long before I bought the album.  I expected the worst, but in the end, \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" hardly turned out to be the major change of direction that some critics have made it out to be.  Admittedly, there is a little more use of the \\"studio as an instrument,\\" which challenges the \\"liveness\\" of the album.  \\"Black Holes\\" prominently features trumpets, orchestras, and drum machines that confront my visualization of Muse's ability to reproduce these songs in a \\"power trio\\" format.<br /><br />However, this initially unfounded criticism quickly gave way to the indisputable fact of the raw talent and vision of Muse as a whole.  The songs on \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" exude the same raw intensity and passion that \\"Absolution\\" exhibited.  While there is a little more \\"studio\\" window dressing, the voices of the musicians in the group are strong and confident.  The compelling mix of Jeff Buckley, Radiohead, and Rush that I perceived on \\"Absolution\\" is still perceptible, sometimes additionally tempered by a little Prince, Beck, and maybe even more recent work by Adrian Belew.<br /><br />Admittedly, I get a personal kick out of comparing Rush to Muse, since there really aren't many bands that I can in indulge in doing so.  In all honesty, \\"Rush-ness\\" is just a small component of their sound, but one that is an old friend of mine.  In the case of \\"Black Holes and Revelations,\\" this element of their sound brings to mind \\"Power Windows,\\" when Rush began to fully integrate the synthetic nature of the studio in their sound.  This perception is undoubtedly influenced by Muse's use of subjectively inspirational text and orchestral sounds on my personal fav \\"City of Delusion,\\" a tune that reminds me strongly (and nostalgically) of Rush's \\"Marathon.\\"  However, I would stop short of saying that this influence is direct.<br /><br />The Lowdown:  I can't seem to take \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" out of my CD player, no matter how many times I spin it.  While it may be a little more overtly political in its lyric approach than its predecessor, it is still a musically strong and relevant statement.  It may not quite beat out \\"Absolution\\" as my favorite Muse album, but I somehow would feel wrong if I gave it any less than five stars.  In fact, it may be my personal \\"album of the year,\\" a title that is only contested by Mew's \\"And the Glass Handed Kites,\\" an album that Muse's fans will most likely dig.indulge in doing so.

0689835604|5.0|I bought this book when my second child was about a year old.  I've since bought it for about 4 friends.  My children absolutely loved this book when they were toddlers.  They would have me read this again and again, and it's easy for parents to read in an animated fashion (i.e., \\"where are babies eyes?\\" [lift the flap] \\"under her hat! It's sturdy too.  A terrific book for babies and toddlers alike.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Great DVD, with good special features. <br /> <br />It took me a long time to get around to watching this wonderful movie, and I am truly sorry I waited so song.  CAPOTE is without a doubt one of the best films of 2005. Though I had not previously been a Heath Ledger fan, I found it hard to believe that anyone could out-do his outstanding performance in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  I was wrong.  Philip Seymour Hoffman was astounding as Truman Capote.  BUT its not just his portrayal of Capote that astounded me.  There are probably many actors who could have done as well, after all its easy to portray a 'real' person, especially someone who was in the public eye as much as Capote was.  He's been photographed and filmed so many times, all one has to do is study these films. The reason I believe Hoffman deserved the best actor OSCAR was because of the scene in the movie where Capote says goodbye to the killers.  This scene just absolutely took my breath away, literally.  The emotion and pain on his face was gut-wrenching.  Hoffman himself appeared to have trouble breathing.  I've never seen anything like it in my life!   <br /> <br />Capote himself was such a flamboyant and charismatic person, that Hoffman had to walk a fine line in order to avoid turning Capote into a caricature of the real man.  In the special features of the DVD, director Bennett Miller tells of his discussion with Hoffman about how he should play the 'goodbye' scene.  Hoffman thought it would be 'too much' for him to break down, and the director gave him leeway to play it as he 'felt' it.  Well, he blew me away.  He walked into that room and his struggle NOT to break down was so REAL that it was hard to watch.  Perry Smith, one of the killers was trying to console HIM, telling him, \\"Its alright.\\" And Capote sobbing, \\"I did my best, I did everything I could, I'm sorry.!  Oh my God! I have to buy this movie for this scene alone. <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|\\"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\\" is a follow up film to the original Final Fantasy VII game, taking place two years after the events of the ending. I haven't played any games in the series, though I've seen enough of my brothers playing it here and there to get the gist of it. There's also a recap of the plot points of the game on the DVD as a special feature, which helped too. Its a watchable blend of action, drama and graphics, which have an ambience to them that's pretty interesting. <br /> <br />Worth a look for fans of the game, and fans of computer animation, I think.
B00003CXUM|5.0|The movie is a piece of art.  Visually, it is stunningly beautiful, and is drenched in nostalgia for a lost time and place.  The erotic tension, the suppressed emotions, makes the movie painful to watch, almost unbearably painful to watch.  The acting is superb.   A classic of modern Hong Kong cinema.
0770430074|4.0|I was introduced to this book as part of my Critical Theory class at college, and I have to admit that it is something else. An observant reader will love the way that it does and--simultaneously--does not tell the story of Pi. Cleverly written, well thought out, and ends the way it should. <br /> <br />The reason this doesn't get a full five stars in my opinion is that there are a couple of parts in the course of Pi's journey that seems to drag, areas in which nothing happens, and it takes too long to have that described to the reader. Still, a wonderful read and highly recommended.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I bought this cd after seeing a televised performance of the same tour.    Ive always thought of John Mayer as a pop star who had some wannabe skills but got lost to stardom.   This cd proves he does what he has to do in the commercial world so he can do what he really wants to do.   Play strong funky, blues-infuenced rock.   \\"Try!\\" is very jam band -oriented but never boring.  But Im sure the pop fans would prefer to hear more of his hits.  They are mostly represented hear by \\"Daughters\\"  that seems to bring more squeals and accompanied singing from the girls in the audience than the other songs.  <br /> <br />Mayer is an amazing talent.  Not only is he an incredible guitarist but he handles his vocals very well at the same time.   The fact that he enlisted and can hang with such heavyweights as bassist Palladino and former Late Show drummer Steve Jordan,  shows his maturity and professionalism.    This cd is a side of Mayer I hope to see more of.   Id like to see his career moving from pop to Stevie Ray Vaughn-style mateiral like this and will eventually end up in Clapton-land,  where he gets the respect from his musical peers as well as popstar success.
B000J103OI|3.0|straight up Meryl Streep is timeless. She is one of the Greatest Actress's Ever period. she plays this role all the way through&maintains that cold calculating edge all the way through. Anne Hathway's Character is the complete opposite of what Meryl Streep's character is. you see a Tension of a Power Hunger driven corperate head in Streep's character that doesn't relate to hathaway's carefree vibe,but you sense as the film goes on that there is a Mutal respect. the film lasts about a Half Hour too long&there is too much side stuff that brings the film down a bit. too me the Film is like corperate glamour 80's meets 90's slacker laid-back mentality with a 00's Programmed mentality. it's a interesting film,but it doesn't get where it should have gotten,but still entertaining.
B00028DOEE|5.0|The reason I am writing this review is that I can't believe all the bad reviews it got, and had to put in my 2 cents!<br /><br />I have never saw a cartoon/Book brought so wonderfully to life, as this one that Ron Howard directed.<br /><br />I guess the Grinch IS obnoxious, but wasn't he in the book, too? And for the make up on the Who's go, They came pretty darn close to how the Who's looked in the cartoon.(Little noses, way off the wall hair do's, funny clothing, big feet.Also, Max the Grinch's dog is just TOO TOO cute :)<br /><br />They also did a good job on the Grinch's appearance.<br /><br />The thing I love most though, is the way they did the town, with all the shops, post office, etc. MILLIONS of dollars went into this, and such DETAIL on EVERYTHING!!!<br /><br />It is just wonderful to watch! The DVD has TONS of extras on it too.Games, songs, etc, for the TV AND PC.<br /><br />The movie is a couple hours long, but what movie isn't ? Actually, it is one hour and forty five minutes long.<br /><br />Like I said , the movie is wonderful, the sets and the actors (especially Jim Carrey) are flawless, and I give it an overall thumbs UP !!!!!<br /><br />It is great for kids and adults alike.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|<br />I was a kid when Superman II came out, so I had no idea about the Donner/Lester controversy.  I have, however, enjoyed watching both of the original Superman movies many times over the years.  So when I picked up the DVD box yesterday, I was intrigued by the controversy it talked about, and decided to buy it to see what all the fuss was about. <br /> <br /> <br />Yuk. Yuk. Yuk.  Mr. Donner seems like a nice guy (from the intro to his version), but with all due respect, I am so glad his version wasn't the one that made it into theaters.  If it  had, then I'm sure that over the years, rather than enjoying Supe II, I would have been lamenting that such a great movie like Supe I was ruined by a lousy sequel.  <br /> <br />Where, oh where, to begin? <br /> <br />1.  In the beginning of Donner's version, we see Lois sitting around the office, idly watching Clark chat with Jimmy Olsen.  She begins doodling on a picture of Superman, filling it in with the features of Clark (hat, glasses).  Thus, she realizes he must be Superman. <br /> <br />If you remember from the original film, Lois was constantly bustling around the office, talking about her hard-hitting stories. She couldn't sit still. And yet here she's wasting time doodling.  What is this, an extended coffee break?  She looks like a schoolgirl bored with her lessons.  At the very least, if Donner wanted a scene like this, he shouldn't have put Clark just a few feet away!  Somehow I think Lois would have had more brains than to be drawing Clark like that when at any moment he could have wandered over and seen it. <br /> <br />2.  Right after this, Lois and Clark are talking in an office.  Lois accuses him of being Superman.  Then she throws herself out the window hoping Supe will save her.  Clark rushes down to the bottom, arranges for her to bounce off an awning, and has her land in a fruit & vegetable stand.  TERRIBLE. Lois is humiliated since she's now covered in muck.  The whole scene makes her look like aditzy heroine from a 1930's screwball comedy, which completely undermines her gutsy, strong character from the original movie.   <br /> <br />I much preferred the whole Paris sequence, which fit her character entirely.  The Lois who \\"relaxes\\" by heading out to the airport to grill the President would certainly smuggle herself into the Eiffel Tower.  If Lois existed today, she'd probably be in the Middle East, embedded with the troops in a flak jacket. If Donner had his way, though, she'd be another Today Show Katie Couric-wannabee.  As a woman, I greatly preferred Lester's portrayal of Lois. <br /> <br />Lester's version, which has Lois throwing herself into the river at Niagra Falls, also made more sense.  She had seen Clark without his glasses, and had just seen Clark disappear/Supe appear and vice-versa.  Her little stunt comes as the culmination of her investigation, like a scientist testing a theory.  In Donner's version, all she has is a drawing and a suspicion.  Her going out the window seems more like a spur-of-the-moment decision, which again doesn't fit with her character. <br /> <br />3.  The \\"revelation\\" scene.  I haven't listened to Donner's commentary yet, so I didn't realize his version was a screentest.  That would explain a lot, though...especially the fact that it was so terrible.  It completely ruined the flow of the movie.  Suddenly, Lois and Clark are in a boxy room that could have been Lois's bathroom from her apartment in Metropolis.  No sense of being in a honymoon suite at a luxury hotel.  And then, she whips out a gun??????     Oh, my goodness.  I kept waiting for Lois to jump up and give some film noirish dialogue.  \\"Ok, copper, you're pretty smart, but not smart enough, see? Now get over in that corner and let me finish you off.\\"  Oh, puh-leez. <br /> <br />And then she shoots him.  Clark panics since the bullet apparently bounces off of him, and feels that he is forced to reveal that he's Superman.  Ok, maybe Superman doesn't feel pain,but if Lois had fired a real bullet (she reveals that she fired a blank) wouldn't he have felt SOMETHING bounce off of him?  Why, then, does he panic?  He could have gotten righteously angry at Lois for pulling such a dangerous stunt and she wouldn't have been any the wiser.  This whole scene was badly written, badly acted, and way too jarring. <br /> <br /> <br />Lester's version was much superior.  In their commentary, the producers speculate that maybe Clark subconsciously wanted to trip so that he could finally drop the pretense.  Whether that's true or not, the scene is much better written.  Supe's relief at finally being able to tell somebody is a better characterization than Donner's, and fits better with their flying off to the Fortress of Solitude together.  I mean, for Pete's sake, would you fly off all lovey-dovey with a woman who pulled a gun on you????    And who tried to trick you, not once, but twice????   Would you trust or respect this woman?  Maybe some gullible guy would, but I can tell you as a woman that I sure as heck wouldn't.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />4.  The first scene in the Fortress of Solitude, where Superman gives up his powers.  Oh, my goodness.  I laughed out loud when Supe started talking to his father, Jor-El.  Marlon Brando comes across as smug, pompous, and arrogant.  Yuk.  And when Supe confesses his love for Lois, Jor-El starts pontificating about how the \\"higher feeling\\" of serving humanity should be enough to fulfill Superman.  Again, hilarious. He sounded like one of those \\"smug marrieds\\" who (in the Christian world) are always urging singles to \\"find their contentment in Jesus.\\"   <br /> <br />This was in complete contrast to Lester's version, which had Supe speaking to his mother. Lara radiated compassion.  Rather than lecturing him on doing his duty, she begged him to reconsider because of how he might feel afterwards.  Maybe it's because I'm a woman myself, but the scene with Lara resonated with me far more than the one with Brando. <br /> <br />5.  And the scene where Supe comes begging to get his powers back is even worse.  Brando comes across as a real jerk.  He treats Supe like a child (\\"Look at me!  Look at me!\\") and lectures him about what a failure he's been. Gads, if Supe had grown up with a version of Kol-El for an earthly father, he probably would have rebelled and turned into one of the Kryptonian villains.  This scene did absolutely nothing for me.  All that mumbo jumbo about the father and son becoming one (so Supe could get his powers back) was just bad. <br /> <br />Now, I admit I was no great fan of Lester's version of this scene.  He doesn't show anything, so you never know how Supe got his stregth back.  However, Donner's version was not a good replacement.  I wish they had filmed some sort of scene with his mother, instead. <br /> <br /> <br />Those were my major objections.  Here are some trivial ones. <br /> <br /> <br />6.  When Supe returns to Metropolis, newly restored, Donner has him saying \\"Well, general, what about the freedom of the Press?\\"  Totally lame.  I agree with other reviewers that Lester's version \\"Well, general, care to step outside?\\"  was far superior. <br /> <br />Also, Lester's recarving of Mt. Rushmore was better than the villians slicing the Washington Monument.   <br /> <br />7.  As a long-time fan of Star Trek, I must say that I have always hated plots that mucked around with time travel.  It just gets way too complicated.  I didn't like the \\"circling the earth\\" plot idea in Supe I, and it was totally out of place in Donner's Supe II.  I won't go into the complications, because other reviewers have already covered them in detail.  Let's just say that I agree with them. <br /> <br />Overall, I'm glad I bought this movie, because it was interesting from a historical viewpoint to see an alternate version.  That's also why I gave this review two stars instead of one.  However, from now on, I'm going to go back to watching the theatrical version.  For me, it was far superior.
B000B7BRMM|1.0|Of the four CD I purchased of Diana Krall's music, this is the worst (or at least I hope it is the worst).
B00005UOKM|5.0|While Blue Note may have been known during the early-to-mid 60s for its string of soul-flavored boogaloo records, there was also during that same period an outpouring of forward thinking, experimental post-bop that challenged the boundaries of jazz convention without dispensing altogether with structure. Led by artists such as Andrew Hill, Bobby Hutcherson, Grachan Moncur III, Jackie McLean, Sam Rivers, Wayne Shorter and Joe Henderson, Blue Note's offerings from 1962-65 were without peer. And if I'm making a list of my favorite Blue Note recordings, regardless of era, then I'm placing Hutcherson's Dialogue in the top five.  <br /> <br />Though is nominally a Hutcherson record, it is in many ways an Andrew Hill record; adventurous, yet accessible. Hill composed four of the albums' six songs, and the flavor of Hill's jagged and harmonically dense piano is predominant throughout the record. The opening song, \\"Catta,\\" is a clear example of Hill's unique approach to composition, placing a repetitive line on top of an odd-metered mambo rhythm. Also evident throughout is Hill's penchant for probing the outer boundaries of meter and harmony, while keeping one foot firmly rooted in compositional structure. But that's not to belittle the contributions of Hutcherson, whose unique approach to the vibes, with it's airy, spacious feel, gives the recording that unmistakable Hutcherson sound.  <br /> <br />Another important contributor is the vastly underrated drummer/composer, Joe Chambers. Along with having one of the best grooves this side of Billy Higgins, Chambers is an excellent composer. His contributions \\"Idle While,\\" a beautiful, lilting waltz-time number, and \\"Dialogue,\\" with its outward leaning, spooky haunted house feel, illustrate his unique compositional talents.  <br /> <br />I would be remiss not to mention the contributions of this records' A-list supporting cast, which includes trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, Sam Rivers on tenor and soprano sax, as well as bass clarinet and flute, and the amazing Richard Davis on bass. Hubbard once again shows his ability to stretch beyond the conventions of his hard-bop roots, and Rivers shows his incredible versatility as a multi-reedist. I have to take exception with N. Dorward of Toronto's remark that Rivers is in \\"middling form\\" on \\"Catta.\\" While I do concur that it is perhaps the strongest composition here, Rivers' tenor solo is wonderful; well constructed, purposeful and probing, without losing site of the song's melody. And as usual, you will not find a better, more versatile bass player than Richard Davis, a classically-trained player with an ear for melodic exploration. <br /> <br />Hutcherson made a number of appearances on the Blue Note label during the early-to-mid 60s, and I've yet to find one that I don't like. Other excellent examples of Hutcherson at his best include his other collaborations with Hill, Andrew!!! and Judgment, as well as Eric Dolphy's Out To Lunch, Jackie McLean's One Step Beyond and Destination Out, Grachan Moncur III's Evolution, Grant Green's Idle Moments, as well as Hutcherson's own Oblique, Stick-Up and Happenings. I highly recommend this recording for anyone that's a fan of avant-garde or post-bop jazz, as well as any fan of Andrew Hill. This is clearly a case of a pure five-star record, and not the typical gushing, hyperbole-filled amazon five-stars.
1400049628|4.0|Max Brooks has put together a rather unique book that it's simply impossible to classify. Part field guide, part arcane zombie history book, and part disaster-training manual, it also manages to keep things serious enough to make you wonder if what it's talking about is real. I began to wonder if Brooks actually believed what he was writing, and that's a big plus point in the book's favor.<br /><br />The book is separated into several portions, ranging from zombie physiology, what zombies can do and can't do, an overview of Solanum, the microorganism that gives life...or \\"unlife\\" to the zombie, as well as a pretty fascinating look at what weapons are best matched against your undead opponents and what kind of structures to barricade yourself in should an outbreak occur. At the end of the book is a pretty extensive collection of \\"historical\\" zombie outbreaks throughout human history. The whole thing is written so seriously that you'll laugh out loud when you get to the end of the book and see several Zombie Action Checklists for the owner's use to keep track of outbreaks.<br /><br />Here's what I've learned should an outbreak occur:<br /><br />-Grab an M1 Garand and lots of ammo<br /><br />-Machetes and trench spikes are superior to machine guns<br /><br />-Get a bicycle...zombies can't hear you and you can always carry your bike over rough terrain, and all without reliance on gasoline<br /><br />-Chainsaws are fun, but will give you a false sense of power (sorry Bruce Campbell!)<br /><br />-Flame throwers are the ultimate zombie-killing weapon.

B000EGCITG|5.0|It is such a shame that this cd is not a major success.  This is, without a doubt, one of the best cds that has recently been released.  P!nk is real...and raw.  It's such a refreshing quality to hear.  By far P!nk's best work... <br /> <br />Is it possible that P!nk is marketed incorrectly?  I mean, the four singles that she released are all great...but, there are by far better tracks on the cd.  \\"Stupid Girls\\" was a great lead off single, but \\"Who Knew\\" and \\"Nobody Knows\\" could have been replaced with \\"Long Way to Happy,\\" \\"Cuz I Can,\\" \\"Runaway,\\" or \\"Leave Me Alone, I'm Lonely.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"U + UR Hand\\" is definitely the stand out track on the cd.  It is the funnest song to dance to...jam out to in the car...or anything else.   <br /> <br />The whole cd is enjoyable and it's a shame that it's not getting the radio play it deserves...
B000021Y77|3.0|I don't like to disagree with the friend who lent me the DVD of this movie.  I always appreciate the foreign cinema.  Since I was stationed in Germany for six years with the U.S. Army and had a few German friends who would occasionally visit me, I was always looking for good German-language films.  Belonging to a family of people who appreciate films, I knew the major classics of the German Expressionist period and the Sternberg-Dietrich collaborations, but I needed something newer to keep young German friends interested.<br /><br />Run Lola Run is very showy, but it lacks depth.  Now, I don't disagree with other people who like this movie very much--the last thing I want is for people to think of me as hostile--but needs something to care about--a reason to exist--where the zippy photography and inter-cut animated segments would ultimately mean something.  Run Lola Run seems to me to be a very shallow film.  Except for this, the film was very good.  The film is successful at adapting a certain aura of contemporary German society, the same side that, like many of us Americans, watch a lot of daytime television; I only intend a deduction.<br /><br />As always, I recommend the following German films: Rosenstrasse, Das Boot, Wings of Desire, and Faraway so Close.
B000ASSDVA|5.0|Great Spanish epic based on the medieval poem that tells the story of the greatest and most legendary Spanish heroe. It is not historically accurate because it follows the Cid of the poem. The real Cid, if you are interested, you can read about in Richard Fletcher's brief study. But I think it captures the idea and greatness of this man very well.<br /><br />There is no question that this man was truly a great warrior, therefore the persistent presence of his legend and aura in Spain's greatest epic poem.<br /><br />Now the film:<br />It's very good despite all the following. Missing scenes that produce lack of coherence, specially in the comprehension of the last hour. Background of the story and adjacent themes and secondary plots are only hinted at, never developed. I can understand that there's a lot that would have to be explained to be able to appreciate the whole story, and that possible another 3 hours would be needed, but this film is way too short. It leaves the impression of an aborted great movie (Hollywood style): he came, he fought, and he rode away. With all the resources available, the natural sceneries (the castle at Pe&ntilde;&iacute;scola in the days before the touristic boom) et al., a different director like David Lean, or even Ridley Scott would have amazed us. Still, the story is so remarkable that I can't give it less than 5 stars. Sofia Loren is in her prime. Charlton Heston is impeccable as THE Cid. The whole spectacle in front of our eyes is awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Oh, Lord what a great story if only it had a great story-teller!
B000002KON|5.0|Ray Davies and the Kinks (with John Dalton on bass) sound like a tight unit.  You can even hear Dave shout with glee while rocking out on \\"Victoria\\". Every song, be it rocker or wistful ballad, is a winner.  The songs never stray far from the album's subject making this recording a cohesive and very thrilling song-cycle.
0307341542|3.0|This book touches on every \\"disease of the week\\" known to man. It deals with cutting, alcoholism, teen drugs and sex, animal cruelty, mean girls, etc. The author doesn't thoroughly draw any conclusions for any of these topics and while I was reading I kept waiting, almost smugly, for the next \\"crisis\\". That said, the story was really pretty good and it left me a bit unsettled. One passage about the pigs was particularly disturbing. I'll never eat a ham sandwich again without thinking about this book. Although the characters were interesting they were highly unbelievable and unlikeable. I was none too sympathetic toward any of them. I would recommend this book to open-minded adults (definitely not for anyone under 16) who like gothic-type mysteries and aren't easily offended by graphic sex and bizarre situations involving children.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|I was very much surprised(in a GOOD way) by this film and only picked up on it after being smitten by the actress who plays Laura(Nora Zehetner), who also happens to be playing one of the special people on NBC's Heroes. When popular critics gave their televised reviews, I was not impressed and only slightly curious.  The mere mention of the kid from Third Rock From the Sun(Gordon-Levitt) and a plot about teens and drugs turned my stomach.  It was only the hint of a story like something from the library of Humphrey Bogart--standing under a lamppost with his tan trenchcoat and fedora while waiting for the dame in the red dress to appear with her side of the story--that made interested.   <br /> <br />  But, alas, I did not get to see the film in the theater. Aside from all the artsy \\"Noir\\" talk--of course this is classified and independent/Sundance film--this movie slipped through my fingers like water on a turtle's back in the summer.  Did that make any sense to you?  Try a whole two hours of chatter like that as fast as you can pronounce the words and understanding all the metaphors. [It helped to put subtitles/captions on and watch the film more than once to catch/comprehend all the lines.] The music is haunting and intoxicating, and the characters are as classical and perfectly cast as they are laughable. The more I watched, the more I was mezmerized. It truly becomes addictive like a drug.  <br /> <br />  Brick is reminiscent of such films as Pulp Fiction and just about any of Leonardo DeCaprio's films--particularly his rendition of Romeo and Juliet but with the personalities of a classic black and white detective story(minus the typewriter in the office).  Visually, it appears like a Type A artsy, high school, independent film--and almost locks itself outside the mainstream world.  Had the dialogue been slower and less intelligent for the characters delivering it, the movie might have garnered a wider audience(although the number of reviews for this film herealone shows a rather large underground audience).  Or, I wouldn't have minded if the characters and scenario DID resemble the classic detective films more, like Dick Tracy(Warren Beaty 1990)-style.  Putting a teen peer pressure story together with a Bogart movie seems rather silly, but I will admit to my own amazement.  One of the problems with memory-intensive lines is that you often lose quality of acting/emotion.  And, this film DOES suffer an emptiness of character depth--with the exception of the trampish Kara and the \\"pot-skulled reef-worm with more hop in his head than blood,\\" Dode.  But, this film has potential.   <br /> <br />  The DVD bonuses are few, but you get a few surprises and glimpses into the minds of the director and cast.  You see the amateur skills/mistakes of film making as well as an extended rendition of a curious poem given a sly read by Nora herself--and this piece is also on the CD Soundtrack(there are also a few insightful images of the actress and her audition tape.   <br /> <br />  The SOUNDTRACK is a set of 40 pieces mainly composed by the artsy direction of (unknown to me) Nathan Johnson which includes the few potent tracks I really liked. [Emily's theme--aka the main theme--with its haunting cowbells and Laura's theme--aka the smooth detective/seductress lounge music are among the best for both casual parties and background music for other films of this nature.  About half of the CD contains other pieces which sound more like a man experimenting with pots, pans and soda cans in his kitchen and calling it a symphony.] Bonus: Put the CD in your computer's CD-ROM drive and get your own downloadable doseable brick(just kidding). I have only rented the film so far and sampled the soundtrack, but I plan on buying both. <br /> <br />
B00008PC2O|5.0|This movie is EXCELLENT. It's better than the first one and that's saying a lot! The sound is GREAT!!! if you do not have a good surround sound system....you are NOT doing this movie any justice. For those of you who have Blu Ray and are thinking about buying this movie on Blu Ray...save yourself some money and just buy the standard DVD Extreme version. It's actually better than the Blu Ray copy. The reviewers say that the Blu Ray copy of this movie is just horrible as with a lot of Blu Ray movies.
0446528056|5.0|John Tyree is tired of living life with no future in sight, determining to do something about it he signs up to become a soldier. Life at home has never been what he could consider normal; his father who was left to raise John had quirks that made him odd and hard to understand even to his son. Often times John would feel as though he didn't belong and the army became a blessing in its ability to create meaningful friendships. It has given him the maturity he lacked while living at home.   <br /> <br />While on leave and surfing he happens upon one of the most beautiful women he has ever laid eyes on.  This beauty was not superficial but instead one of warmth and radiance that envelopes the senses capturing his heart from the moment they met. Savannah, knows that this is the man that she could spend her life loving, the intensity of him keeps him etched in her mind. Leave is coming to an end and with it uncertainty follows, together they promise to keep in touch and work through this challenge determined to be together one day. But in one day his world comes crashing in around him, with the delivery of a single letter.  <br /> <br />Nicholas Sparks once again bring us a tale from the heart that uses issues so prevalent to what people are going through right now that it leaves you tender after reading it. John Tyree like so many soldiers see both the blessing and the curse in the paths they have set for themselves. For readers that have not had this life experience this character opens your eyes to the reality from one soldiers eyes. In Savannah we find a remarkable faith filled woman with only the most honorable of intentions. Her passion for life and her dream of making the world better leaves you in awe of her selflessness.  The combination of both characters creates so much magnetism it is impossible to tear you away from the story.   <br /> <br />Like so many books written by Nicholas Sparks, Dear John is one that will prove to be impossible not to pass on to someone you care about. Books such as his are meant to be shared, treasured and learned from each showing a side of human strengths and frailties. It is what makes people fall in love with they way books were intended to be. These experiences gathered throughout his novels leave an enlightening feeling that stays with you long after the last page is finished. Dear John is no exception, as this latest book affects all types of people and every political background.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Joyce <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Copyright © 2006 CK2S Kwips and Kritiques.

B000HBKCDC|4.0|Probably the best Christmas album I have heard, but I am biased because I am a Sarah fan. Unlike Diana Krall and other celebs, she omits many of the Xmas cliches, and all the songs sound refreshingly Sarah-style, and because it is Christmas, they are not depressing either, which is very much unlike her :) I would not give it 5 stars because it is not really timeless, plus there are a couple of duds on an otherwise strong album. Still, very strongly recommended.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I quite clearly remember hearing Karma Police on the radio one day, must have been in '97. It was one of those moments where you regain your belief that pop colture/popular music or whatever you want to call it, still holds some redeeming values. I was in my mid-twenties at the time and was only familiar with \\"creep\\" previously from Radiohead, and I thought it was an okay song but nothing to brag about. And everything else being played from everyone else was just barely passable. But Karma Police grabbed me and never let me go. I got to know the rest of the album slowly over the following months and was completely floored. The songs are very depressing and yet very human and musically just overflowing with great ideas. Thom Yorke has the most haunting and perfect voice to give life to these songs. Besides Karma Police, other especially fantastic songs include No Surprises, Subterranian Homesick Alien, The Tourist, Exit Music, and of course the ever so perfect Lucky.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I adore this movie. I saw it in the theater back when I was a teenager, and it inspired 2 years of spring break tours of Civil War sites with my family. At 4 hours, it's long, but it never feels overlong. The editing is tight, the acting is fantastic, the score is gorgeous, and the subject matter is compelling. It's based on Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels, but transfers the moving story without the sometimes ponderous prose. A perfect choice for American history classes or anyone interested in the Civil War or American history in general.
0671015206|5.0|This is a great read for all. My husband is so educated on finances and investing so I decicde that I would start to learn about the subject I started with a book call Think like a billionaire by Scot Anderson then I read this book on The millionaire next door these two books have educated me and helped me understand money and investing. The next book I am starting is Two Men One Message.
076790382X|5.0|Bill Bryson is a great travel writer. His descriptions are evocative and his prose is gut-wrenchingly funny. In fact, I don't read his books in public because I usually wind up crying from laughter. This one, the first of his books that I read, is a classic. Bryson details his readjustment to American culture after 20 years in England, and offers a number of hilarious insights about life in both countries - and about his unfailing ability to poke fun at any situation. Because it's basically a collection of short (2-4 page) newspaper columns, it's particularly easy to read. You can also take a break without losing the narrative flow - there really isn't one. When you're done with this one, hopefully having decided you love Bill Bryson as much as I do, move on to two of his best works: A Walk in the Woods, about his adventures on the Appalachian Trial, and In a Sunburned Country, about the wilds of Australia.
B000022TSH|5.0|Experiencing older Hollywood films, films made in the era when script, direction, cinematography, lighting, musical scoring and acting became melded together in an intricate but cohesive escapist adventure, is like visiting a fine art museum - masters at work creating a living work of art that time only enhances in respect.<br /><br />Such is the case for Roman Polanski's 1974 film noir CHINATOWN. Robert Towne's brilliant script is the baseline for this fascinatnig story of the Los Angeles and environs of the 1930s, a time when power was wedded to corruption, greed, family secrets of aberrant stature, and manipulation of resources (here the Department of Water and Power, the police, and entrepreneurs).  Using the inimitable Jack Nicholson as the smart and daring private detective who pries open a conspiracy in the family of John Huston and his daughter Faye Dunaway whose private life secret is as huge as the water stealing crimes that are at the basis of the story was a stroke of genius that has rarely been matched since.  And tying all of this together with one of Jerry Goldsmith's finest musical scores and cinematography that is liquid and redolent of the wastes that were the at the core of Los Angeles' prostitution of sunlight and shadow - the desert by the sea - was part of Polanski's genius for direction.<br /><br />For viewing an example of the finest in filmmaking, CHINATOWN remains at the top of the list.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|I don't know what they did to change and improve this show so much, but whatever they did, it really, really, worked.  The womyn were animated and the songs they sang were more to my liking than the Celtic Woman songs. <br /> <br />This is just the opposite of Riverdance, the first edition was by far the best.  This edition is so MUCH BETTER than the first one, that it's almost like watching a totally different group of womyn. <br /> <br />Kudos to everyone who made all the improvements and keep it up!  I'm probably going to buy this DVD!

B00065MDRW|5.0|Blending elements of several forms of music, including classical, jazz, and folk, four young British musicians banded together in 1969 as King Crimson and recorded a five-song masterpiece.  Looking back in time to the year when this album was released, it has oftentimes been said that King Crimson's first album, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", was a milestone in rock music history that marked the beginning of a new branch in rock music henceforth called, \\"progressive or art rock.\\"  However, it would be amiss to claim here that this group had accomplished this feat all alone.  There were a number of other prominent rock groups at the time such as The Moody Blues and Deep Purple who were likewise experimenting along the same lines.  Both of these groups had also been strongly influenced by classical music, and The Moody Blues, in particular, released two groundbreaking albums that same year.  These two albums, \\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\" and \\"To Our Children's Children\\", were phenomenal in their own right.  Like King Crimson, The Moody Blues prominently used a relatively new instrument at that time called, the mellotron.  In addition, certain harsh and heavy passages from this album by King Crimson have, at times, been credited as being a strong influence in the formation, and early development, of yet another form, or branch, of rock music, namely, \\"heavy metal.\\"  And now, and most fortunately, King Crimson's debut album, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", has, once again, been remastered using the latest advances in digital technology for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.<br /><br />The early stages of this group's formation saw three friends, Robert Fripp, Michael Giles, and Peter Giles, enter the studio and record a number of songs together under the name of \\"Giles, Giles, and Fripp.\\"  Robert Fripp was a versatile guitarist with the ability to play a wide range of styles.  Along the way, they were joined by Ian McDonald, a multi-instrumentalist, who played various woodwind instruments and who also played a number of different keyboards, including the mellotron.  When one of the Giles brothers left the band, he was soon replaced with Greg Lake on bass and vocals.  With the final addition of Peter Sinfield as lyricist, the group was formed.  The year was late 1968.<br /><br />The album's strong appeal, no doubt, lay in the group's prominent use of the mellotron.  Without its use, the album would certainly not have reached masterpiece status.  This instrument (actually, an amalgam of prerecorded tapes) replaced the diverse sounds of an entire philharmonic orchestra.  Rock groups had already been experimenting, and recording, with the mellotron for sometime, ever since the Summer of Love.  The Rolling Stones, for one, first began to use the mellotron in 1967 when they were writing songs for their upcoming album, \\"For Their Satanic Majesties Request.\\"  The Rolling Stones, too, had a talented multi-instrumentalist in Brian Jones.  During the psychedelic era, musicians from various groups, ranging from David Bowie to Pink Floyd, took an interest in, and a quick liking to, the mellotron, especially with its outworldly sounds.  However, the Stones soon returned to their R&B roots, abandoning further experimentation in that direction with the mellotron.  The Moody Blues, on the other hand, who had previously employed the full services of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, found the mellotron to be a suitable replacement for the orchestra, and they soon integrated the new instrument into their recordings (and also into their upcoming touring plans.)  Mike Pinder of The Moody Blues became quite proficient with its use.<br /><br />The Rolling Stones did not forget their brief experimentation with the mellotron, and their affection towards it.  And when it came time to introduce to the public, especially their fans, their new line-up in the summer of 1969, featuring guitarist extraordinaire Mick Taylor, at a free concertin London's Hyde Park, they invited King Crimson to precede them on stage.  It was a great honor.  The group's unconventional approach to rock music that day blew away the crowd.  Needless to say, these Stone's fans knew that they had just experienced something very special musically, something new and refreshing.  It had been the public debut of King Crimson!<br /><br />The end for King Crimson's stellar initial line-up was nonetheless near.  While on tour in North America to support the release of their debut album, tensions within the band became apparent.  Giles and McDonald declared that they planned to leave the band at the conclusion of the tour and record together.  Their ensuing album entitled, \\"McDonald and Giles\\", unsurprisingly had much of the same feel as King Crimson's debut album.  It is worth a listen.  Greg Lake soon thereafter left the band, too, to form the supergroup, Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, with Keith Emerson on keyboards (formerly with the band, The Nice) and Carl Palmer on drums (formerly with Atomic Rooster.)  This band's popularity, especially with fans of progressive rock, soon eclipsed the popularity of King Crimson.  Before he left King Crimson, however, Greg Lake began work with the remaining members of the band on several tracks for the band's second album, \\"In the Wake of Poseidon.\\"  Further down the line, Ian McDonald founded another prominent group in the mid-1970's.

B00003ZKS1|5.0|I agree with one of the other reviewers who said that it is a travesty that Schenker's material is not more well known than it is. This debut album by MSG is a classic which, if you don't own it already, is like somebody saying they're into art but haven't heard of the Mona Lisa. Classic Rock and Michael Schenker are synonymous - in my view everybody else is a footnote compared to this man's talent.

B00005K3OT|5.0|Look what the North wind blew into a small town in France ... a young mother named Vianne and her daughter, Anouk. Vianne rents a shop which opens to the town square where she opens an unique Chocolate shop. The only problem is ... it is Lent. The town is mostly Catholic, they are celebrating Lent by abstaining from certain pleasures, one of which is likely chocolate. Depriving oneself or abstaining from something one loves is a custom or tradition during Lent. Vianne is an outsider, she and her daughter are trying to fit in and be accepted. In a small French town which has a long history with many old traditions and customs, this is a difficult endeavor. This delightful film shows how prejudice and stubborn beliefs *toward* *newcomers* can be overcome ... with humor and chocolate. Serious moments arise when vindictiveness and cruelty challenge the main characters spirit and nature, yet in the end understanding and kindness prevail.<br /><br />The eccentric characters in the film are delightful and funny ... The mayor acts \\"holier-than-thou\\" except his secretary Caroline knows the truth ... There may be marriage problems between the mayor and his wife. The wife had gone on an extended vacation to Italy, with no definite date to return. Caroline seems an up-tight and very controlling personality  related to her son and her mother who is elderly.Then the viewer discovers, the mother is diabetic and does not monitor her food intake properly which makes her health deteriorate. The mayor learns Vianne is a single mother of which he disapproves. He provides gossip about her to the towns people, influencing them to avoid her shop. However, the mouth-watering treats are a temptation several citizens can not resist. One such person is an elderly gentleman and his dog  as they walk by the shop daily. It is the dog that is drawn to the treats . The elderly man wants to court a widow ... Vianne gives him pointers on how to win over his lady love ...<br /><br />Some gypsies enter the scene as they arrive in house boats and dock on the Thames. From this point forward, the story gets more complicated ... Vianne gets involved romantically with the leader of the gypsies. Vianne provides a home and shelter to an abused wife of a bar owner. The husband of this wife goes to classes to learn how to improve his behavior, he appears contrite and \\"reformed\\" but in the end, as they say \\"a leopard does not lose his spots\\" and he nearly ruins the lives of many people, nearly killing many by an act of cruelty. The conclusion of the film ties together the serious and humorous aspects of the story in a most creative manner. This film is amusing, charming, and delightful. It has a very satisfying ending.

B0006399FS|3.0|Although I would still rather listen to this than most of the other garbage that seems to dominate the American music scene, this is not a great album.  In fact, it is incredibly average and is my least favorite U2 album.  I bought it the day it was released, listened to it for a few weeks and, with the exception of \\"Original of the Species,\\" have not listened to any of it since.  It is bland and boring. <br /> <br />A few years ago when Bono said that U2 were re-applying for the job of the world's greatest rock and roll band he must have meant that they were going to stop taking risks and instead churn out safe music that would appeal to the mainstream.  This is exactly what they did with ATYCLB and HTDAAB, and it seems to have paid dividends with both critics and listeners--as evidenced by album sales and the number of awards they have received in the past 5 years.  However, in my opinion, these two albums simply are not even in the same ballpark as Achtung Baby and Pop. <br /> <br />I guess I am saying that I give this album only a lukewarm recommendation.  I would buy Achtung Baby, Joshua Tree, Pop or Zooropa before I would think about purchasing this one.  I only hope U2's next album is a better one.

1400032717|3.0|Mark Haddon's first novel is an impressive look inside the head of an autistic teenager(though, for all intents and purposes, he seems like a younger child). The author's 'experiment' with telling the whole story from Christopher's viewpoint isn't perfect...but then, the whole point of the book is to show that life itself is imperfect, but we can still manage to make something good of it.  <br /> The concept of the story is executed in a way that may not sit well with certain readers(including a few-thankfully only a few-Amazon reviewers).  <br />I think it does help to have at least a slight knowledge and understanding of the various types of autistic disorders and their symptoms and 'quirks'. Without this knowledge, readers who might have gained some valuable insight will just give up on this book too easily. <br />The hints and 'clues' given throughout the story lead to a satisfying, and only somewhat melodramatic, climax, which leaves the reader (and Christopher) feeling like it's definitely been one of the 'good' days! <br />Haddon shows plenty of insight into the subject, though some of Christopher's personality quirks are more associated with cetain types of autism than with others. I can understand some of the reservations the autistic community had with this, but presumably, it is 'artistic license'. One problem I had with the book is that some of Christopher's more rambling, unfocused 'digressions'(particularly his authoritative-sounding views on religion) sound like they were obviously written by an adult author trying to cram in info he picked up in his research for the book, rather than an autistic youngster who just happened to memorize the information. Christopher's summary of a logic problem('The Monty Hall puzzle') from 'Parade Magazine' seems more disjointed than it should have been, as if Haddon himself glossed over some of the information a bit. <br />Despite the varying tone, and the somewhat compressed format of the story, this 'Curious Incident' is a worthwhile read...one that may be hard for its author to top!

1596912367|5.0|A government plants phony newspaper articles to exaggerate a distant threat and lure the United States into a foreign conflict. No, it's not a potboiler about the road to the Iraq War. Instead, in RESTLESS, William Boyd has woven a fascinating historical spy thriller from stunning facts revealed only a few years ago about a British propaganda machine whose goal was to persuade a reluctant America to join Britain's fight against Nazi Germany. <br /> <br />As Hitler's armies advanced across Europe after the invasion of Poland in 1939, the overwhelming majority of Americans responded favorably to isolationist calls to keep this country out of war. Philip Roth's 2004 novel, THE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA, vividly imagines that powerful and very real sentiment harnessed to defeat Franklin D. Roosevelt in his quest for a third term and elect Charles Lindbergh on an antiwar platform. <br /> <br />To counter these attitudes, in 1940, with the tacit approval of the Roosevelt administration, the British government established an agency known as British Security Coordination, with an office at Rockefeller Center in the heart of midtown Manhattan. The goal of BSC --- through a network of agents that, at its peak, numbered as many as 3,000 in the United States --- was to spread disinformation intended to mobilize American public opinion to support this country's entry into war. As Boyd describes it, in a recent essay about the novel in The Guardian, \\"Some of BSC's schemes verged on the absurd; some were highly sophisticated media manipulation.\\" <br /> <br />RESTLESS opens in 1976 in a quiet Oxfordshire village. Sally Gilmartin is living an unassuming life in a small cottage there, tending her garden and enjoying occasional visits from her daughter Ruth, who is fitfully pursuing a graduate degree at Oxford and earning a modest living tutoring foreign students in English to support her young son. Ruth's fear that her mother is exhibiting the early signs of senile dementia gives way to curiosity when Sally hands her a typewritten memoir, entitled THE STORY OF EVA DELECTORSKAYA, and reveals that she's a Russian émigré who had been recruited by a shadowy handler, Lucas Romer, to work in the BSC program. \\"We all have secrets,\\" Sally says. \\"No one knows even half the truth about anybody else, however close or intimate they are.\\" <br /> <br />The balance of the novel alternates between Ruth's first-person narrative and Eva's account of her espionage work, told in the third person. Boyd tries to inject some drama into Ruth's story through one subplot featuring her relationship with her student Hamid, a refugee from Iran, and another involving the mysterious appearance of her brother-in-law Ludger and his girlfriend Ilse, who Ruth suspects (without much evidence) may be loosely connected with a German terrorist group. There's little doubt which tale is the more compelling. Eva's tale begins in Paris in 1939, and traces her path from Europe to New York, across the United States to a fateful rendezvous in New Mexico, to Canada and then back to London, where it ends when she meets her husband and Ruth's father, Sean Gilmartin, in 1942. <br /> <br />Eva's early work for BSC, jokingly referred to as \\"The Rumour Factory,\\" has an almost prankish quality as she concocts fake newspaper stories and poses as a correspondent, all with the goal of heightening American fears about the German threat. But as the tide of war continues to run in Germany's favor and Britain's need to enlist its American ally becomes more desperate, she realizes the game she's involved in is a deadly serious one that may even jeopardize her life. <br /> <br />Ruth works her way through Eva's compelling narrative, acknowledging that \\"My mother's sudden revelatory detonation had rocked me so powerfully that I had deliberately treated it as a fiction at first, reluctantly letting the dawning truth arrive, filling me slowly, gradually.\\" As she does so, it becomes clear that Sally has shared the story purposefully, hoping to enlist Ruth in her plan to settle an old score with Lucas Romer and reveal a shocking secret about her former handler. <br /> <br />Like the best spy stories, the pleasures of RESTLESS lie as much in the way Boyd illuminates the nuances of human character as in the scenes of heart-pounding action, although there are more than a few of the latter. In this richly satisfying work, he reaffirms his credentials as an accomplished prose craftsman and combines that gift with storytelling skills that will appeal to fans of the best work of masters like Graham Greene and John le Carre. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg (mwn52@aol.com)
B000G73UEU|3.0|Sadly if you are looking for Martha Wainwright's amazing performance of The Traitor from the DVD Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man, you won't find it here. For some strange reason they have used alternate versions of the music from the DVD for this CD. For me this was unexpected as I got the CD 'Original Soundtrack' for the performances I had seen on the DVD. Seems like I was duped.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I'm ticked at the Amazon reviewer; I read his review and lost 3 good weeks with this album!  He was so lukewarm that I resisted buying it, despite the fact that I've always enjoyed Sarah McLachlan's music.  After hearing \\"River\\" on an episode of ER I reconsidered and bought the album, and it is the new favorite of both my husband and me.  I'm not sure what the Amazon reviewer was looking for, but I find the whole album to be interesting twists on familiar songs with a few new ones thrown in to keep it interesting.  \\"River\\" and  \\"First Noel/Mary,Mary\\"  are two really nice additions to this year's Christmas repetoire - original and yet familiar, with nice minor key nuances to give them a nice edge for just sitting around and listening to music.  If you like Sarah McLachlan, you'll like this album.
0618680004|4.0|This book is written beautifully and has many good points.    It is about beliefs in religion, however are any beliefs real, whether religious or not?     The human mind has an amazing ability to use mental conditioning to imagine and create allsorts of 'ideas' about the world which are not based on reality... This book examines many of these primitive ideas and delusional mental programming and thus exposes the ignorance of them.    However this book is already out of date since humanity is moving beyond rational thinking. The understanding of non-duality and non-locality in Quantum Physics, direct observation/awareness and holistic understanding has moved beyond the dualistic thinking mind of western philosophy. There are a growing number of people who see beyond conceptualisations and beliefs and are looking at wisdom that transcends unquestioned conventional thoughts.    Although so called atheism tends to be wiser than religious fundamentalism (who are totally closed off from reality), they still create their own materialistic beliefs and ignore the spiritual dimension of oneness which is becoming increasingly obvious among scientists, philosophers, ecologists and builders.     Atheists have become the very thing that they are attacking and many lack an open mind in order to see beyond their own conventional conditioning and egoic thinking...     Read J Krishnamurti, Professor David Bohm, Professor Fritjof Capra, James Christopher, Eckhart Tolle, Douglas Harding, Genpo Roshi and many other Modern physics and non-dual/Zen/perennial teachings...
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|I went to see this at the theatre on a whim. It could have been great, good, mediocre or awful for all I cared at the time. I even got in late, probably missing the first 10 minutes or so-- well, at the moment the boy and girl are hiding, whenever that occurs.<br />I watch a lot of Turner Classic Movies on cable so I felt prepared for this film.<br />It was enjoyable enough, I can actually say I liked it. I understand the other reviewer's comments both good and bad things to say. It could be that this movie is very dependant on personal preference of what it should be. It isn't some kind of action-thriller or adventure, even though in some strange way it still is. There should be less thinking done by the viewer than it calls for. Could possibly make a nice bedtime movie.<br />I think it deserves a 4 star rating from me. I must say that even though this movie will probably become lost in obscurity over time it just might survive as perfectly watchable by many people. The overall ratings verify my opinion.<br /><br />Update: got the widescreen DVD, now I know I missed more than I thought by not seeing the beginning before now. I knew the 'magic' involved was supposed to be fairly unbelievable and at the same time all a 'trick'. I think the start of the movie plants this notion so the rest makes sense.<br /><br />Didn't expect to like it the second time as much as I have, so I think the 4 stars I gave is correct as long as I'm being rigorous about it. The movie is obviously meant to be some fun, not completely maniacally plotted-- which I first recalled the movie as being at the theater.<br /><br />From Webster online: maniacal<br />1 : affected with or suggestive of madness &lt;maniacal laughter><br />2 : characterized by ungovernable excitement or frenzy : FRANTIC &lt;a maniacal mob><br /><br />Although, it does have its dark side.
B00005JPCD|5.0|I just saw this with some friends -- great movie! It did get pretty dark in some parts, but for most of it I was laughing until I cried. People shouldn't take it all so seriously; sure, there's a blatant save-the-animals plug and some poking fun at various stereotypes, but it's nothing to get offended about. I thought the Scottish-accented penguin pope was hilarious.
B000GIWRIY|5.0|Roots to Branches was an instant classic from the moment I first heard it. I bought it the day it came out and today it remains on my top three Jethro Tull releases of all time, usually occupying the very top spot and for good reason. Each song sounds at once as if it had always existed in some classic rock time capsule that had just been unearthed, and Eastern influences swirl throughout much of the record like the smoke from a hookah, hanging in the air with poetic grace. With Roots to Branches Mr. Anderson found music that perfectly suited the changes in his voice and used it to great effect, sounding not unlike old wood polished with a deep finish over a period of many years.   The songs themselves are well crafted and rich in texture. Roots to Branches builds up slowly from out of the darkness and casts shadowy chords across a lyrical landscape of ever changing beliefs with a mixture of sadness and sarcasm. Rare and Precious Chain snakes its way through a hypnotic rhythm, with enchanting results, while Out of the Noise runs rampant in pursuit of playful disregard to any musical boundaries. This Free Will has a weight to it you can virtually feel, and the song Valley is a deeply moving track set to a parable about the haves and have nots laid bare against a background of moral inconsistencies. It's one of my favorites in a record filled with favorites. Dangerous Veils dances wildly about in strip tease fashion, Beside Myself sounds refreshingly familiar and new all at once, and Wounded, Old and Treacherous is mischievous and devilishly good.  At Last, Forever, Stuck out in the August Rain, and Another Harry's Bar seem to me to be incredibly beautiful odes to love and mortality told with a sense of wistfulness and melancholy.   There is a religious undercurrent that threads the songs together, weaving a tapestry of imagies that is neither preachy or negative, but rather subtle and not so subtle backdrops to the underlying messages. Whether it's Me and the Dog andthe Ghost of Harry or the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, we all want to make this world turn right. You could be sitting in a pew or on a barstool and still have a deeply moving religious experience that motivates you to do something worthwhile, even if it's nothing more than chosing the Buy it Now With One Click option on Amazon dot com while looking at the Roots to Branches CD. It's a little slice of heaven unto itself.

B00005JPE7|3.0|Before I saw this movie, I asked myself 'who will this movie appeal to?' For old folks (such as myself), this iteration of Rocky might make me realize just how old we both are  (not a pleasant thought). To the younger generation, it might make them wonder why this movie needed to be made at all. After seeing the film, there is still no answer to my question.<br /><br />The film is classic 'Rocky'. There are the endearing qualities of Rocky the man (such as referring to a Jamaican as  `a European') as well as the typical character witticisms we've come to love over the last thirty years. There is also Rocky's fondness for a former boxer (Spider Rico) he once fought (but not near the character development we saw with Apollo Creed).<br /><br />We see familiar faces and places, such as Adrian (in flashback) whom Rocky visits regularly at the cemetery, Bert Young (as Paulie), and of course, the steps of the Philadelphia Museum (the end credits were a nice touch). There's even a cameo by Mike Tyson. But for most of the film Rocky is bemoaning the departed Adrian. It is almost pathetic to watch him visit memorable sites they once shared, such as the ice rink, which is no longer there. Enough already.<br /><br />The movie is replete with 'shadows'. Rocky--living in the shadow of his former greatness--reduced to reliving the stories of fights long past. Rocky's son--now an inept businessman--living in the shadow of his father's legend. And Rocky's new love interest (wonderfully played by Irish actress Geraldine Hughes whose Philly brogue hides her strong accent)--living in the shadow of Adrian, with a son old enough to soon make her a grandmother. (Has it really been this long?)<br /><br />To summarize the plot, Rocky still has a 'something in his basement' to exorcise the beast within (presumably to fight again). Mason Dixon is an unpopular heavyweight champ who (again presumably) would benefit from a fight with Rocky, after a computer fight has the Rock knocking him out. And so, the stage is set: the 'up-and-coming' Dixon will battle 'has been', Rocky. The match is arranged as a glorified exhibition, and Rocky must prove that 'the heart is the last thing to go'.<br /><br />We're left to wonder, however, how this young boxer has anything to gain when he has everything to lose--a point cogently made in the film. This plot flaw--along with the absolutely 'goes nowhere' love interest--seriously cripples the movie.<br /><br />But what this movie really lacks is believability, and the build-up we've come to expect toward pulling for the Rock to upset an opponent we love to hate. Mason Dixon never convinces us that he truly wants to destroy Rocky, or that he is unable to do so when he finally gets the chance. (The writers obviously anticipated this credibility issue, and the fighter breaks his hand.) Also, this fighter creates nowhere near the fight anticipation Ivan Drago created in Rocky IV. There is simply no hate between the rivals, and even in the fight, we wonder who will win more than we really care.<br /><br />In the end, (without giving it away) let's say Rocky is mercifully retired forever. To their credit, the writers did not create an unbelievable ending to an unbelievable movie. As much as many of us loved the old films, we could not help but cringe when the Rock finally bears his chest. He is old, wrinkled, and fat. This time he cannot make us believe he should be in that ring, much less make us believe he could survive what happens in it. In previous Rocky movies, the fight piqued our suspense, and the ending made us cheer. In this one, we are left to merely endure the fight, and simply wish it over so we can see what novelty ending the writers will provide us this time.<br /><br />I loved the old 'Rocky's'. But like most fighters he stayed for one fight too many. This movie made me feel really old and tired. Mercifully, ran less than a couple of hours, and I will always have the old Rocky movies when I need inspiration rather than a spoon of Geritol.inspiration rather than a spoon of Geritol. <br />

0752545639|4.0|It is very nice to have the complete works in one place.  I do have to agree with another reviewer on the pages being so thin; my highlighter pen bled through to both sides and when I scibbled notes in the margins, it shows through on the opposite side making it difficult to read.  But, even with that, the benefit of having a ready reference to so many cherished words is worth the inconvenience to me.  I just decided to use light pencil marks to annotate my favorite passages and that alleviated that problem.
0156027321|1.0|While Pi's philosophical discourse begins innocently enough, he suddenly starts blathering such nonsense about agnostics that I could not take him seriously after that.  For example, he says that he does not like agnostics because the core of their belief system is \\"doubt\\".  While this view might pander to some religious readers, or even to those who expect to find God somehow in this novel, it is manifestly wrong.  How could such an enlightened person as Pi hold such an erroneous, oversimplified view of agnosticism?  For me, this gross inconsistency in his belief system recast him in the role of a seriously disillusioned young man.  In the vague hope that the remainder of the novel would somehow redeem his character, I finished it.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.   I hope that others who read this book and find God do not as easily find themselves with a false bias against agnosticism.
B0009UC810|4.0|This cult classic will get your foot tapping and singing along with some of the best rhytm and blues you can encounter in one place.  The police car pileups will leave Chicago never the same, nor will we.  The Akroyd-Belushi will be difficult to match again.  The music will keep you singing for hours after the movie ends. The irreverant humor will provide you with a plethora of one-liners to remember and give you a chuckle later on.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|I love movies without big budgets and without big stars.  I went to see this because of the reviews, and was a bit dissapointed.  The characters were excellent and it was pretty funny at times, but over all, I didn't really feel much when it was over.  I probably won't see it ever again, and really wouldn't recomend it to anyone.  At the same time I didn't feel robbed of my money when I saw it in the movies.  So if you want to see it, my advise would be to rent before buying, because while it was an ok movie, I'm not sure most would watch it more than once.
0312263511|4.0|Gene Cernan's memoir is among the first rank of space program books. What sets this work apart is the focus on intensely personal matters. Cernan highlights the competition for flights, with sharp comments about his colleagues and rivals. Many other astronauts get high praise, with notable exceptions, such as Buzz Aldrin. Some reviewers didn't appreciate the personal comments, whereas I felt they made the book more interesting. <br /> <br />There's a distinction between perhaps not liking a guy for what he says and the quality and flow of the writing, which I consider excellent. Often, it's as if Cernan were right there chatting. Even in showing some ego, Mr. Cernan also made no bones about being relatively lucky. He covers the surprise invitation to try out for the program and his surprising acceptance against stiff competition. He also admits he was in the middle of the pack in his group, and on the edge of getting a flight. If not for the deaths of Elliott See and Charlie Bassett, Cernan might be unknown. The candor is refreshing. Well, except for maybe the name dropping about big shots and Hollywood stars. <br /> <br />Even more surprising is the frank discussion of his marriage to Barbara, which eventually failed. I can't help but wonder what she thought of her presentation, ranging from the attractive partner to the highly skilled \\"astronaut wife\\" and on to the crushing side of being the dutiful wife. Cernan does not spare himself from blame by any means. The quote of the book may well be Barbara's: someone asked, \\"How do you feel about Gene going to the Moon?\\" She answered instantly. \\"If you think going to the Moon is hard, try staying home.\\" <br /> <br />Cernan gives more coverage of Gemini than the typical book, with again quite a bit on speculation about crew rotations, and a strong segment on Gemini 9 and his near-fatal spacewalk. Another highlight is the opening chapter on Apollo 1 and the fire, of profound significance to Cernan as a member of the backup crew and friend and neighbor of Roger Chaffee. His pain was still there thirty years later. <br /> <br />Apollo 10's coverage has just the right feel, with Cernan possibly still shaking his head in recalling their near crash, \\"a fifteen-second lifetime during which we made about eight cartwheels above the Moon, and Tom jerked Snoopy back onto a tight leash. Ole Mumbles do know how to fly. After analyzing the data, experts surmised that we had continued spinning for only two more seconds, Tom and I would have crashed.\\" That text again reflects the attractive conversational style. <br /> <br />Apollo 17 probably gets fewer pages than some readers may wish. The play-by-play of the EVAs is fairly brief, which may just as well be left to the non-memoir books. Cernan tries to spend more time on his feelings, the interactions with Schmitt, and some key moments, such as the orange soil and the broken fender.  <br /> <br />Readers should also watch part 12 of \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" for its segment on Apollo 17. My copy of the memoirs is signed by Cernan, Stafford, and co-author Don Davis. It's an excellent book, even unsigned!

B000JBWWQ0|5.0|I missed seeing this movie in Seattle last June by a couple hours, when it was there on a limited release.  It has been a long 6 months, but well worth the wait.  The only debate about the movie is the old \\"book to movie one\\", which is obviously a challenge for any film maker.  Just as the book swept to the top of the best seller list without the usual advertizing but by word of mouth, I hope the same happens with the DVD.  I look forward to the \\"conversation\\" starting again as it did when the original story came out.  Just as the book was not meant to be a \\"literary\\" best seller, the movie is not \\"Oscar\\" material, but a vehicle to inject ideas into our lives and re-awaken possibilities.  For me, the cast did a wonderful job, which corresponded with how I had envisioned the characters as I read the book, especially \\"Wil\\" and \\"John\\".
015670160X|5.0|This is a review among many reviews and will leave out the tale of the story assuming it has already been read here.  This tremendous novel is one of my two favorites.  \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez also luxuriously takes the reader through a lifetime that lasts many lifetimes in length.  The reader becomes a traveler through a society, culture and location while watching time fly by at a rate 2-5 times that of the lives we actually live.  Both stories give the reader a sense that judgement about experience can extend to generations of experience and not just to one's single, private, say, 80 year period. The benefit of reading these books, to young readers who are trying to stretch their own personal horizons, is beyond belief.<br /><br />Each story is a gift from it's author on a level seen almost no where else.  With all modesty I'll say that they are imaginative, funny and compelling.<br /><br />Another text that transcends the perspective of one lifetime in one person's viewfinder is \\"Foundation and it's Trilogy\\" although that work of science fiction is simply not in the class of literature of the other two.

I worked for her for 4 years and got a new oppertunity. And when I left she took me to a fancy restaurant and give me rollerblades and a Filofax. And tolled me I was her best assistant who could handle her. She even asked me to stay but I thanked her for the experience she gave me and it always reminds me of not to be that kind of boss. <br />This movie is so fantastic, fast and of course fashionable great. Meryl Streep plays it very well that you almost hate her in the caracter she plays.

B000001GK0|5.0|Krystian Zimerman is one of the greatest pianist of the modern era. His technique is excellent, but it is the superb artistry of his performances which makes him one of the half dozen or so greatest pianists currently performing. Furthermore, Zimerman is guite selective in what he performs and records. He limits his repertoire to music which he personally likes and with which he feels empathy, rather than recording whatever the public wants to buy. I do not mean to disparage Zimerman's performance of the Schumann concerto when I say that his performance of the Grieg concerto is one of the finest ever recorded by anyone. The Grieg concerto is one of the greatest piano concertos ever written, and the performance on this CD is one of the few which fully does it justice. If you like piano music and do not yet know this outstanding artist, this CD would be a very good place to make his acquaintance.
B000063DFQ|3.0|With their fourth release(releasing an album every year 80-83)Iron Maiden return with 'Piece Of Mind'. An album that has some good tracks and some tasteless ones. Four albums and four line-up changes. With a new drummer on board(Nicko\\"I Love The Ride Cymbal\\" Mcbrain) Iron Maiden begins to widen their sound and arrangments but it seems to come out a bit unfocused with filler tracks through out. Thats not to say there aren't any gems here. Tracks like 'Where Eagles Dare', 'Revelations','Flight of Icarus', and the immensly popular 'Trooper' are all Maiden staples and are well enjoyed. Even the closer 'To Tame a Land' is a great epic. But the others just seem forced and uninspired. The worst to come to mind is the cheesy sounding 'Die With Your Boots On'. What a horrible song reminding me of something off of 'No Prayer For The Dying' ehh. But I look at this album as a stepping stone for great things to come. And it is certainly worth owning as with all their 80's albums.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is a real treat for me or anyone around my age or younger because we will never have the chance to see Led Zeppelin live since Bonham (rest in peace) is no longer with us.  Before this DVD, the only live footage I had of Zeppelin was \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" movie and even though it contains some good performances, they are interupted by those fantasy sequences.  This DVD on the other hand only contains classic Zeppelin performances.  Disk one does not seem to be as popular with everyone as disk two, but there are plenty classic performances on disk one such as \\"Dazed And Confused,\\" \\"How Many More Times,\\" \\"I Can't Quit Your Babe,\\" \\"White Summer,\\" \\"Moby Dick,\\" and \\"What Is And What Should Never Be.\\"  It is true that the cameras don't capture every aspect of the performances, but in my opinion, the camera work on disk one is far better than most concerts shot at the time (including \\"Woodstock\\") and any Paul McCartney concert available on DVD today.  Their Royal Albert Hall performance definitely has good angles so you could see the band play (it captures Page very well).  Disk one is incredible.  Disk two is even better.  The Madison Square Garden performances are quite good actually (especially \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"The Ocean\\").  \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" and \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" are also a great performances but the camera people shot more of Page's head instead of him playing the guitar.  Why weren't these songs included on \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" movie?  The best part of Disk two is the footage from \\"Earl's Court\\" and \\"Knebworth.\\"  Starting with \\"Earl's Court,\\" every performance is classic.  \\"Going To California\\" is breath taking, \\"Bron Aur Stomp (not sure of the spelling)\\" has turned into a Zep favorite of mine, \\"In My Time of Dying\\" is definitely a stand out, and this is the best filmed version of the classic \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"  Moving on to the Knebworth footage there is a killer version of \\"Achilles Last Stand,\\" \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" willsimply rock your world, \\"In The Evening\\" has the Zep men playing with the fire that they were known for, and \\"Kashmir\\" is featured in its ultimate version.  Any performances that I left out are also classic.  How about the band?  Page proves why is is one of the best guitar players on the face of the earth, Plant sings his heart out and has loads and loads of energy, the world gets to finally see why Bonham was one of the two best drummers who ever lived (Keith Moon was the other one), and even though Jonesy isn't shown as much as his bandmates, you know he's there with his exceptional bass and keyboard playing (he also plays the mandolin).  The camera doesn't totally ignore Jones though, but the focus is mainly on Plant and Page and then Bonham.  I must say too that the sound and camera work are both incredible for footage that was shot over twenty years ago.  Why can't some concert DVDs shot nowadays (Paul McCartney) be this good?  In fact, whoever is in charge of filming and assembling a concert DVD should use this Led Zeppelin DVD as a model for how it should look and sound.  How about the special features?  Great interview footage on disk two with Plant, Page, and Bonham.  Disk two also contains promos of \\"Over The Hills and Far Away\\" and \\"Traveling Riverside Blues.\\"  Disk one has like a thousand versions of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" performed for television but this is still a treat.  The concert footage is what makes this DVD so good.  Good isn't even the word for it.  It's incredible and spectacular.  I also hope that Page finds some more old footage of performances featuring some songs that did not make it on to this DVD, but either way, this is the ultimate Led Zeppelin DVD and possibly the best filmed concert on DVD for any band.
