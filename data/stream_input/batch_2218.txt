1932907009|5.0|Has great projects, ideas and tips to keep you focused on writing your screenplay. I would suggest you start the screenplay as you read. Do not start before or after.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It was a nice easy read.  Full of little bits of perspectives of every day life! Perfect book for a mom with not a lot of time to spend reading.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My kids love this game. As a Star Wars fan (the original three movies not the latest stuff), get quite a giggle out of it. The star wars related sound effects are really funny. This was a brilliant theme.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have not read this book myself but my wife loved the entire series. This makes me very happy!!! P.S. Get some rest you will need it!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It just one of the great book that you will never want to miss it. I could not even put down the book. The storyline itself has been great and it tell you no matter how bad one person get hit. As long as you believe in Silver Lining like what Pat strongly believe and hold on to, some day, you will see one yourself. It give hope and faith. Greatly done!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use- helpful- Wonderful- BEST OF ALL, ITS FREE!!!!!!!! Cant beat free- does everything it says it does- ROCKS!!
B008XG1X18|2.0|Was a FIVE STAR  app, but now this app will no longer allow me to log in under my facebook profile on my kindle fire. When I try to log in with facebook I get a blank white screen with an &quot;x&quot; in the top left corner.  Please help!  I love pinterest, but now I can no longer access it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is very fun.  I am so glad I got it.  It's also relaxing.<br />&quot;Rain&quot;is relaxing in and of itself.  This game was good money spent.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|My five year old likes this game.  I like that it's difference from other games in that you have to tilt the kindle to navigate through the course.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I can actually see the screen with glasses . Pretty easy to figure out for an old 62 year old. I<br />Am having fun with my Kindle Fire. More of these games. Keeps the memory fresh.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 9 year old loved Angry birds until he got this app for Bad Piggies, and now he loves this one more!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|This is a great book that I would recommend to anyone of my friends which I already have I hope someone has recommended this book to you too
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Valuable insights and marvelous anecdotes, a compelling journey through our mind as it directs and interprets our actions; a serious contribution
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I'm 45 years old so when my daughter, who is 17 suggested that we watch this movie as one of our family night movies, I gave in reluctantly. Very entertaining! I could see myself watching it again!
1451695195|5.0|I LOVED this book in so many ways.  I have recommended it to all my friends and have loaned out my copy 3 times already.  Everyone who reads it loves it because it makes them feel peaceful about where we are ultimately going.  I especially like Dr. Alexander's explanation of how he felt about his patient's description of &#34;the other side&#34; prior to his experience, as opposed to after his experience.  Thank you, Dr. Alexander!!!!
B007JMW46U|5.0|Sir Athur Conan Doyle is in my estimation the greatest mystery writer ever.  This eBook certainly does his work justice, especially the inclusion of the early illustrations.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is the easiest fraction calculator that I have used.  It is perfect for woodworking and cooking. The calculator has you enter the numbers the same as you would write them down.
B00AN1G3WA|2.0|This is truly a mediocre ensemble effort. The arrangements seem to echo one cliche after another. It is a strange mixture of old big band charts and bad disco background structures. It certainly suggests a giant step backward for ensemble jazz. The soloing is a slight relief from the pomp and repetition of the band. When I first listened, I couldn't believe that the arrangers had ever even heard Michael Jackson's music. It has more in common with the terrible soundtrack recordings from 70s youth exploitation films. I played it again today and couldn't make it through any of the tracks. It is rather surprising that the music of a seminal artist could inspire something so unlistenable. I give it one star for Rava who deserves better and one star for ECM who rarely disappoints on this scale.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I love that this series is all in one pack!  It is a great series and I don't want to stop watching it.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Plots deepen, strategies unfold.  Stilll a little cumbersome due to the length of the book---But I will be moving on to Book 3.
B004132HZS|5.0|I have aloways enjoyed a good mystery Sherlock offers some of the best mysteries of all time. Great series. Love it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The story itself is great.  The only problem is that at a few places in the book, the pages repeat and I have to skip ahead then back up.
B002WY65W4|1.0|If you are buying this DVD set to get the Digital Copy do not purchase it.  The code is expired and there is no way to get a fresh code to get the digital copy.<br /><br />Other than that Bill Murray rocks!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|I like the convenience of listening to the local radio while I work on my computer.  I had lots of choices.  I was able to listen to my favorite stations.  Glad I did it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Watched the move was weird at first but by the end i loved it. Would recommend for others to watch it.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I love this CD, and it has been in my  CD player since I bought it. Can't get enough of it. It rocks out but has more mellow moments as well. I've been waiting for solo Jack, and he delivered!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the game.  However,  I am playing on my Kindle Fire and have lots of issues wether it be loading or locking up.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|If you are used to Bejeweled, the graphics on this game will look like crayon coloring book illustrations.<br />The motion is really crude as well.
B005LAIII0|2.0|I did not like it that much and definitely will not watch it again. There is a couple of good episodes, but other than that it is a below average movie for me.
B007O4XX9K|5.0|This new CD is great. It sounds like classic Joe Walsh. I had it on in my car, and my friend didn't even realize it wasn't old Joe Walsh.  There is only one song on the CD I tend to skip, but this is a nice, solid, offering from a classic.
B0047DVHV2|1.0|There are only so many books that don't grab my attention and I was bitterly disappointed by this book.  I didn't read just one page but got at least quarter way through.  Perhaps I wasn't in the right frame of thinking but I was disappointed that a book about rob Lowe got my attention within 10 pages yet by 150 pages of this book.... I was bored.  And I'm not a prude anti 70s loving person.
B000NMW6M0|5.0|Babel is a unique piece that explores the differences between various cultures and ethnicities. It aims to expand people's world views – all while entertaining and captivating the audience. It's filled with some great acting. The actors and actresses are superb, and they display such visceral emotions.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the movie Crash, then you will probably like Babel. They seem very similar to me in terms of message(s), style, and emotional theme. Babel is a little more serious and &#34;intense&#34; (intellectually), but it seems to strike the same chord.
B005BQNC44|5.0|I'd just finished another similar story (sadly there are too many weirdos out there!), when Amazon recommended this book.  I'd naively thought it would gloss over the sadistic acts like the previous book.... I was wrong and that was discovered earlier in the book.  You realise early on what a miserable life she has lived, but has the courage to keep going. One of my best reads for 2012
B0000DJE9R|5.0|When I bought the other Michael Jackson for my friend I also got her this one as well.  She says that it has everything she loves about him and she misses him a great deal as do I.
B000IKNZMM|5.0|There has always been the question of what caused the Hindenburg to burn up like it did!This movie i think is close enough to that cause and what an outstanding cast they had for this movie...An incredible must see movie for everyone!!!
B003OPUZYY|5.0|Sad news came in yesterday that the great guitarist Alvin Lee passed away at 68, another tragic loss in the rock and roll world.  Back to this album \\"Think About The Times:  Chrysalis Years 1969-1972\\",  48 Ten Years After top tracks!  Just a great package, if you love TYA from this era, you can't go wrong.  R.I.P. Alvin.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This is a really cute animated movie. It would be fun to watch with kids or just with some friends who don't care that they aren't the target audience. Adam Sandler's Dracula does start to sound more like some of his characters from other movies but if you can get past knowing it is him and just imagine it IS Dracula, you'll be fine.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Needed a copy of this movie after ours was lost.<br /><br />Bought this copy from Amazon for $5! It also had the original Ultra-Violet copy code.<br /><br />The Ultra-Violet copy code was expired but I wrote an email on Warner Bros. website and they still honored the UV code!<br />They even gave me the iTunes code and it is now in my Apple TV cloud library.<br /><br />For $5, Amazon delivered free with Prime. I got a great DVD and a digital copy all for $5. Apple wanted triple just for their copy alone.<br /><br />Great deal.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Some plot details may be discussed.<br />I had hoped this would be better. I thought it was funny that the previews show the niece in one scene using a current reference that in the movie didn't exist. While this was great marketing to show the movie was relevant, it made the movie seem disingenuous. It started out with a premise that seemed to make sense and then Segel's character just got weird in the middle. It was as if this would make the movie funnier but in reality it simply made it sad. Why would a top chef who would be capable of running his own restaurant under the ownership of another chef be willing to take a sandwich job and not simply find a restaurant rental and create his own vision? He obviously knew how to run a kitchen and a business from a managerial point. Oh well. I watched it. I laughed some...I was happy with how it ended. I was just unhappy with the middle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an amazing app Iove it I play it every day except Sunday but I just don't know how to update it can someone help me please.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|While you come to expect a certain amount of makeup from Tim Burton productions and a certain bit of cheese factor (especially given the actual show it was based on) I would say that it was at times hard to discern the living from the &#34;dead&#34; in this movie about the reunion of the Collins family. Plot lines from many seasons of a show were hastily fit into a much too long movie and seemingly came out of no where in order to make the characters seem worth their effort of being included in the movie.<br />Burton could have chosen to follow any one thread and created a much more cohesive and well thought out and planned movie, but tried instead to be all things to every fan of the original. This caused a failure instead.
1452110581|5.0|Got this for my husband (he came in this relationship with 3 cats.  While I am a dog person and the cats can cause some arguments- we both enjoyed this book.

B0058PJ6NE|1.0|I do not know why anyone would buy this.  This app just suddenly appeared in the apps section.  Horrible Horrible
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like that you change to different levels each time you complete one country or city. You also do missions.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Love this series!  Ordered second season, also. And all of the books. Will watch it over and over again. Highly recommend this.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As in &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; Follett creates characters through whose eyes and experiences his readers see the history of the causes and happenings of World War II, including the follow on of the Marshall Plan that probably prevented a WW III. This is a wonderful follow up to &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; and makes one anxious to read his third novel in this trilogy.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Cannot get enough of this entire series! Can't wait for Season 3.  It is thrilling, exciting, and I will watch it again and again.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|As in his other historical novels Follett creates believable characters and then provides his readers with a view of history through their eyes and experiences. In this case it is about the excesses of the aristocracies in England, Germany and Russia, the lead up to World War I, the decline of all those aristocracies, the beginnings of Bolshevism, and the beginnings of what created the Nazis government in Germany.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Excellent reading! Thoroughly enjoying the entire series!  Even ordered the Seasons on DVD. Have recommended this entire series to everyone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is so good! I'm not a huge book reader and I read this really fast! The book and movie are both amazing! AMAZING!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This entire series is fantastic. Can't put the books down and can't wait to see what happens next.  Highly recommend this.
B007W4OZ76|1.0|It's not self explanatory, I couldn't find a tutorial and couldn't get it to connect to my Dropbox account even with the additional fake Dropbox app. I think it's ridiculous that there isn't a Dropbox app.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Reading now. Can't put it down. Love this entire series and don't want it to end. Highly recommend this series.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|Didn't do anything, wouldn't open even with the extra Anttek download. Cant understand why there isn't a Dropbox app from Dropbox?
0307730697|5.0|This is a great human story with a tragic ending. All gave some, some gave all. God bless America !!!
B002N14GPE|3.0|The movie has a very interesting twist.  I did not see it coming.  It's one of those movies that you want to hit someone over the head and tell them to stop bring stupid
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I love this story of triumph, trial and freedom. It is gritty, real and heart breaking. the characters stand out and blend into a magnificent cast that makes you cry, laugh and cheer on the bad guys.
B000I0QL82|2.0|We thought this was the updated colorized version,.  It was not.  Cover is in color and we thought the written discription also indicated color version. It was black and white only...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After you will read the book you will understand why i have chosen to name my review like this. I just finished reading it and i am profoundly under the power of the emotions and characters described in this book. It is true that at the beginning i was rolling my eyes, thinking \\"great, another reading with teenagers that act as if they were over 35\\" but I soon went over it and focus on the story itself. I can always imagine that the characters are a little older for the steamy romance going on in between them but then again, i do this with other similar books.<br />But, to describe the powerful effect that this book had over me, without actually spoiling the fun by revealing the plot, I would say that all the scenes and the interior battle of the characters it seems after a while almost like someone is telling you their story themselves, you get over the feeling of reading just another book. And it is definitely not just another book where he and she get together and overcome it all almost to easy, this book starts slowly almost like a clear summer sun, then suddenly it becomes hotter and cloudy like just before the rain and after a while it begins pouring with feelings, situations and ideas that you wish you would never have to be under that rain yourself but that you are somehow hipnotized by it and you can not stop watch it or smell it. And at the very end the rainbow forms just a bit, not brighting at once the atmosphere but definitely giving you a glimpse of a sunny day again.<br />I liked listening to Sky and observing the way she deals with what life reserved for her and I liked the real way in which Holder grows older and more mature at her side in less than a year time and mainly i liked the fact that is not about the rapid crashing attraction between the two, but about growing up together in a matter of weeks which seems like forever. This book is very well thought and very well ploted. All i am finding myself thinking is that was not based on a real story. I hope is just the amazing fantasy of Colleen Hoover. And I also feel like reaching out for all the victims out there, not in a pitty way but in a supporting frinedly like way, telling them that I hope they will find in themselves the strength to get over this ugly part of their lives the same way sky did.<br />Thank you Colleen & Congratulation!. I hope is just the amazing fantasy of Colleen Hoover. And I also feel like reaching out for all the victims out there, not in a pitty way but in a supporting frinedly like way, telling them that I hope they will find in themselves the strength to get over this ugly part of their lives the same way sky did.<br />Thank you Colleen & Congratulation!
B005VJ8ATS|4.0|This is pretty wildly original, a combination of sci-fi and romance and indie mumblecore style that is striking.  it's well-written and well-directed - and presented with confidence, without a need to conform to typical styles or pacing.  And Brit Marling's got a weird and undeniable charisma.  Its only flaw is the corny and quite unbelievable sci-fi premise at its center.  If you can get past that, heck of a movie.
1439156816|5.0|This is a great book for any aspiring author, and one I will return to and recommend as a publisher. Some of my favorite gems:<br /><br />* \\"I think I was forty before I realized that almost every writer of fiction and poetry who has ever published a line has been accused by someone of wasting his or her God-given talent. If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing, I suppose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it, that's all.\\" (50)<br /><br />* Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open. (57)<br /><br />* Put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn't in the middle of the room. Life isn't a support-system for art. It's the other way around. (101)<br /><br />* One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you're maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. (117)<br /><br />* Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful. (118)<br /><br />* Verbs come in two types, active and passive. With an active verb, the subject of the sentence is doing something. With a passive verb, something is being done to the subject fo the sentence. The subject is just letting it happen. You should avoid the passive tense. (122)<br /><br />* I'm convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing. (127)<br /><br />* When composing it's best not to think too much about where paragraphs begin and end; the trick is to let nature take its course. If you don't like it later on, fix it then. (132)<br /><br />* If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There's no way around these two things that I'm aware of, no shortcut. (145) [He suggests reading 4-6 hours a day]<br /><br />* If you don't have time to read, you don't have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that. (147)<br /><br />* Reading is the creative center of a writer's life. (147)<br /><br />Elsewhere, King gives practical advice on the type of space you should write in, how many pages to aim for per day, the best way to attribute dialogue, and much more. This book is chock full of useful advice, as you can see, and if you are in a rut it is one of the best books you can pick up and read. Highly Recommended.creative center of a writer's life.

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I thought this movie was OK but my teen/young adult kids thought it was great.  My husband also loved it.  He was laughing so hard that he could hardly breathe.  If you like Seth MacFarlane's humor then you will like this movie.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|It's fun to watch for a while and then it gets tedious. The movie is largely focused on sex and is typical cheap rendition of what society has over blown for commercial reasons. Great acting indeed - very enjoyable scenes - Jack's a great actor no doubt. Amanda is a babe.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Finished this in 2 nights. It was entertaining and an interesting concept. Will definitely be reading the other books in the series.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved the characters and the subtle humor. \\"pat\\" is a great character. I really look forward to seeing the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS APP IS ADDICTIVE!!!!!!! :) I LOVE IT!!!!! I WANT MORE CITIES AND MORE UPGRADES!!!! I WILL NEVER GET RID OF THIS GAME!!!!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!
1450419895|5.0|I just want to echo everyone else's glowing reviews of the book, with one caveat. This is NOT a second edition of the first book, as I have seen it described. the introduction explicitly states<br /><br />&#34;In our previous book The Strength Training Anatomy Workout, we addressed the basic concerns of beginners in strength training: How many times should you work out each week? How many times should you work each muscle? How long should your workouts take, and how long should you exercise?How many sets, exercises and repetitions should you do? And we showed you how to design personalized strength training programs to best meet your individual needs. This second book does not revisit any of those basic issues.&#34;<br /><br />So if you're just starting out or wanting an introduction to the technical side of strength training, I would start with The Strength Training Anatomy 1 (with the blue cover). This book is still an excellent read, however, so be sure to pick it up once you feel ready to move onto more advanced studies.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Worth reading over and over again. I will keep this as a hardcopy should amazon ever plummet to the abyss and electricity ceases to function reliably. I want to make sure this survives the times with star wars, star trek, tolkien and harry potter.
B00932A3SK|5.0|I really like this movie the main character did a good job of jumping in and out of different worlds while also being a cool frenchman.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I would highly recommend.  Could not put down this book, loved everything about it from start to finish.  One of the better books I've read in a long time.
B007PS0DTI|5.0|I think this movie is great. The sequal to the first Underworld ends up having a great storyline in this movie. Maybe not as shattering as the first film, but hey at least they made some more of them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome. It is not as good as the Pc version but it is still awesome. I would recomond this app for people who travel.
B005LAII08|5.0|Here is proof positive that a family movie can be made that has 2 participating parents, without making the plot too difficult to manage.  My youngest daughter now wants to take up archery.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|As a book fan, I found season 2 to be a letdown. There was far too much deviation from the book characters and events. Some of the events were not explained well enough for non-book viewers to follow- Why is Arya repeating all thoses names? Why are there so many 2 person conversations that weren't even enlightening?  I miss Meera and Benjen and am sure Bran does too.  Hooray for Tyrion and Bran- The talent behind these two characters save the entire season.
B00BESKTMG|2.0|This movie had to many unbelievable twist and turns in it.  It was also hard to keep up with the story line at times.
B008WZHWCE|2.0|Great talent in this movie, but a lot of it is wasted on a slow moving plot!! Definitely not a great movie, but it gives you a bit to think about.......
B009IK5UJ4|4.0|Just loved this re-release. There are textures to these songs which seem to fit together like the shades and colours in a beautiful painting. Rewards the listener more deeply with each listen. No sense in preaching to the converted although worth noting that most of the tracks on the second CD seem to have a finer clarity (less complex) and stand up alongside the cuts on the final release. Am actually playing it more at the moment. Nice to hear the songs in a different light. A great band to discover or rediscover.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Wish this came on Blu Ray but I'll take regular DVD over nothing at all. Excellent cast, story lines and Meghan Markle is absolutely stunning.

B0091LS0BU|3.0|Production values were good but lacked creative efforts. For example, more vocal harmony would have been nice. Paul's voice is better on the DVD than on the CD of the same name.
B000P0J09W|5.0|The DVD compared well to others in this genre. I like everything about it, it's a classic. The sound and picture looks great for a standard DVD. It was definitely worth the money and I would recommend to others.
0399160450|2.0|I had not read Tom Clancy for a long time.  Enjoyed his works from the eighties and nineties.  This book feels like a fake old master painting.  It feels like someone copied the brush strokes well enough, yet came up with an inferior copy of something good.  The main premise is hard to believe.  The son of a serving president is a government assassin? Come on! If I were a foreign operative, I would make it a priority to capture Jack Ryan Junior and use him as leverage against his father.  Jack junior said he only appeared on tv once in a while with family, but that would be more than enough for a nasty foreign government to have an excellent idea what he looked like.  And really, what hero is a junior anyway?
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|This movie is disturbing.  Very disturbing.  I watched it on a plane, and I kept wondering if the people behind me could see my kindle.  I was thinking, &#34;are people behind me concerned that I keep watching super 8 films of whole families being brutal murdered?&#34;  Yeah whole families, killed repeatedly.  Scary, sick, and well written.  It will scare the hell out of you.
0517543052|5.0|I very much recommend everyone to read this. It will change things around in your mind with total realization of things.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|It is a great sequel.  Super corny, tons of reference to action movies gone by.  Lot's of bullets and bombs.  I laughed, the fight scenes were cool, it almost had a plot.  I watched it on a long flight, and it was very entertaining.

B002MGGM9I|3.0|I had skipped over this one many times while searching for a movie to watch.  I like the paranormal but had always read the synopsis for Donnie Darko and wasn't too interested.<br /><br />Week, I finally watched it and wasn't impressed.  It's a bit of a sleeper movie and seemed slow to me.  Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job however.  I don't want to take away from that.  Nice to see him and Maggie working together.<br /><br />Not my cup of tea.  Sorry.
B004GYY714|2.0|The app functions nicely but they lacked several of my favorite stations in my hometown I wanted to listen to. Go with iheartradio to get a more complete list.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This was a surprisingly heart warming story with plenty of tidbits for adults and kids alike. As a young 20's male, I found a lovely trip down nostalgia lane thoroughly enjoyable as I got to see my favorite arcade games brought to life in a new way. The movie also delivers a great underdog tale with a good message. Everybody deserves a chance to be a hero.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the better animated movies I've seen in recent years.
1863514201|5.0|Trish Burr is an expert needler and an instructor. Her book offers simple, well demonstrated projects. Therefore I chose this educational tool.<br />I have examined some manuals but did not feel comfortable with the way the projects were presented, ie, not graphic enough.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Ok, I have read the books and watched the series. While the first season is amazing and a near perfect adaptation of a literary work (in my opinion), this one is far from! The story deviates considerably from the source material. So much so that I was forced to separate this from the book in my eyes.<br /><br />The show is still one of the best available on cable right now though. The acting and effects are top notch, and despite a few unnecessarily drawn out parts, the plot moves along rather well.<br /><br />In conclusion, book fans be aware this is not GRRM's Game of Thrones. HBO is making their own living breathing entity. It's like living in the alternate reality of a book you love. It's the same, but very different.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|It was a great book from start to finish, learned alot about alzheimers disease and how it affects everyone around them
0765317389|4.0|Sometimes I am quite grateful for the long stretch of time I was inactive in reading Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels. Because of this long hiatus from the genre I’m able to pick up hundreds of classics and discover them for the first time. “Ender’s Game” is one such title that I’ve just now gotten around to reading. In case anyone else reading this review had been living under a rock with me, here’s a quick look at the synopsis:<br /><br />Alright, this is a reasonably short book and makes for an enjoyable quick read. At its core this book is a coming of age story about a young man who is forced to grow-up unfairly early. The book grapples with many psychological aspects of Ender Wiggin being thrust into this adult-minded world at such a young age and having to deal with being disjointed from the others children around him due to his brilliance. Grooming a leader is neither an easy or a gentle task, and his internal struggles as he copes with these situations is quite enjoyable. Despite Ender’s many strengths, he still remains relatable to readers as we are shown his fragility and are reminded that he is in fact only a young child.<br /><br />I enjoyed the storytelling style used by Orson Scott Card. The book switches between using a narrative tone for long durations then briefly cuts to dialogue in sections. This writing style made me feel like I was seeing multiple perspectives to the same scenes. I enjoyed the way these styles where used as a tool to give scenes more layering.  The vocabulary of the novel was very easy to follow and I was able to get comfortable not think too hard about anything except for the thought process of the characters I was reading about. This was especially nice I had just finished reading a high fantasy book that constantly challenged me by forcing me to remember obscure name after name.<br /><br />There was only one thing about this book that continually seemed to bother me. All of the children that participate in this elite program are supposed to be the brightest and most fit for leadership, so why then do they adopt such a terrible Ebonics-like slang language when speaking amongst themselves? It’s not too distracting after a while, but when I was first starting the book it bugged (or perhaps in this books case “buggered”) me. I feel a collection of the best and brightest children would speak more grammatically correct.  This is just a minor annoyance in otherwise perfectly enjoyable read.<br /><br />Overall, I can see why this book is considered a Sci-Fi classic. However, I wish the book would have elaborated further on the buggers…  But hey, what are sequels for? If any of you out there have not read this book, and you are looking for an enjoyable book to glue your nose in for a day, I suggest you check it out. The book wastes no time getting to the plot, so you’ll be engrossed in the story from the very first page!
B003O86FMW|5.0|read it! buy it! love it! and wait for the movie to come out! :) i absolutely love this trilogy!
0553106635|5.0|This is by far the best book in the ASOIAF series. GRRM knows how to make amazing characters that readers fall in love with and isn't afraid to take them away. This book brought me from happy to sad to angry repeatedly. This is probably the single most enjoyable read I've had in my young life. I'm not even exaggerating...

B008VBYN80|2.0|Okay this game is fun, but at a certain point you cannot advance any further. The currency you use are coins and gems, coins can be earned so can gems.  But gems are extremely rare to get, by level 30 you might have collected 50 gems.  The really cool and strong fighters cost 28 gems. Once they die you can resurrect them for 14 gems.  But you run out of gems too fast.  Of course you can buy gems (with REAL Money) to get to the top levels you would have to do this, and it could add up fast.  Until they offer all items to be bought by coins (even a bunch) I will not recommend this to anyone, if you did not pay attention someone could run up a large tab buying gems to advance...Basically a money trap that I would recommend against starting.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have played lots of mystery games at least 20 this one is worth the money its longer than most and lots to do without being too awful confusing where u get stuck in a spot with no help and cant figure out where to go next if your going to spend the money this is absolutely worth it

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The show is as fun as always but getting a bit predictable.  The writers seemed to have even more fun this year writing for Maggie Smith.  The ending was just dreadful, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B00BKEMX28|5.0|They went in a different direction from their last album and nine inch nailed it. Just a great collaboration from the fab four, Mariqueen, Trent, Atticus, and Rob.
B008M87GJK|5.0|If you like to keep up to date this will give you updates on news stories that are of interest. Its a bit more worldly than the usual American news outlets which seem to be only interested in politics, a subject I prefer never to read about.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|Star Trek Nemesis is a strange film. We have a fresh perspective from new writers and a new director and with a focus on Romulans for a change. It's a recipe to refresh the Star Trek movie franchise. What we end up with is a movie that pays little to no attention to established canon and gives us a story that is duller than the worst episodes of any Trek series. Sadly, it killed off the original series of movies that started back with the first film.<br /><br />Let me get the good out of the way. This movie often looks good and the space battle is the best since Wrath of Khan. From there, the movie does everything wrong.<br /><br />How do I list the things wrong with the film? First of all, if you are a fan, a true fan, the continuity issues will drive you crazy. Why is Wesley at the wedding? Isn't he with the Traveler? (and why no lines for him). Then Mr. Worf. OK, he can been invited to the wedding. That's fine. But why is he part of the crew? Isn't he ambassador to the Klingon Homeworld? Then we have the case of B-4. Absolutely no mention of Lore. Why??? He caused them plenty of problems in the past. And how would Shinzon find B-4? I just don't buy the concept of B4 except to help with the ending of the film.<br /><br />Next up, the characters. They do not look like they are having any real fun. The jokes are ALL forced (Mr. Data? Shut Up...Irving Berlin...Very astute...etc.) and not funny in the least. Even the fun loving Jonathan Frakes seemed almost bored. Spinners B-4 seemed weak and even when he was trying to be funny as Data, it just seemed very bland. Poor Gates McFadden...she barely got any screen time and if she did, it had no character relevance at all. And with all do respect to Marina Sirtis, when Shinzon talked about her being beautiful and such, she looked nothing of the sort. Granted, it may have been the lighting, makeup, hairstyle, but I didn't buy it.<br /><br />Finally, the story was rather bland. A clone of Picard left to die on a mining planet and has years of bitterness built up and he is mad. Mind you, some of the duality questions with him and Picard were somewhat interesting but this is not a movie plot, especially if you want to try to bring in new fans. (SPOILER) We end the movie on the note of Data dying to save Picard. This had no emotional resonance, especially in the very awkward and short memorial scene. This scene should have packed more emotion and it just sat there. Oh, we remember Pop Goes The Weasel! Great, let's move on. Come on! That scene needed to be more. And finally, we are left with a sort of but not really an ending for The Next Generation. This cast and crew deserves a better send off for sure.<br /><br />Nemesis has the look and feel of a successful movie but you peal away the layers of problems, you are left with next to nothing.t and has years of bitterness built up and he is mad.

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Good acting helps this out a little and makes up for an entirely unbelievable story that was filmed even more unbelievably.
B0095P33IW|4.0|The interesting thing here is how, in a world of Superheroes, do you make the &#34;normal&#34; guy interesting.  The movie handles the topic well and serves as a could lead in to the Avengers ensemble movie released after this one.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|To say that this book is a breeze to read would be a lie. The writing style is quite easy to read. It's the emotional impact of those simple sentences that are hardest part.<br /><br />I've read so many sad, bittersweet books that I cannot begin to count. But, this one.... oh, how lovely the pain is expressed. I sobbed like a baby.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|He mastered the art of storytelling through classics like Buffy and Firefly.  He proved he could take small screen concepts to the big screen in Serenity. Here he proves that he can be sensitive to material with some of the most picky fanboys in the whole world. The movie is a fun diversion.  Eventually will own this one.  Well done, Mr. Wheaton.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|just when i thought temple run was the best game in the world the temple run creator people went and and made temple run two. temple run two has so many more features such as the rail road tracks the and the zip line thing this game is amazing yall
B0055N0FZM|5.0|This story is well told and heartbreaking.  I would highly recommend it for any young teen (or even adult).  It gives a glimpse into a world that none of us want to admit happened in our history.  I think everyone should read this book!
B00004CXYQ|1.0|It seems there are almost no copies of this movie available on DVD, with exception to the couple I found on Amazon. However, the disc I got is NOT coded for playback in the United Staes and won't play on my DVD player! While I don't neccesarily fault the seller for this (seems seller is from Italy), it would have been nice to have a warning of some kind that this disc will not play on machines in the United States...particularly if it's going to be shipped to a US address.

B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Awful. Nothing more then a clutter non-stop special effects reel and nothing too amazing at that. They made this whole movie just so they could bring back the 3-tittied prostitute. Like that was supposed to be the \\"OOOHHHHH YEAAAAA!!! IT'S THREE BREASTED PROSTITUTE GIRL YEA!!!!!!!!! WOOOOHOOOOOOO!!!!!!\\". Entire movie bored me to falling asleep... TWICE... on the third night I finished it only because I felt bad for the poor DVD which would most likely end up spending the rest of it's entire life in a Goodwill.<br /><br />I'm off now to erase this movie from my mind.
B00B935SUY|5.0|One of the most (if not only) captivating documentary on the music business of recording! It harkens to a time when bands had to play and record into analog tape. I highly recommend this if you're not only a music fan but a player too!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much and it keeps me busy. This app helped me give my twin sisters something to do on a rainy day.
B00138H0H4|4.0|I love The Story.  Beautiful song.  This woman has a very lovely, easy to listen to voice.  Get it, it will be worth it.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I thought this book was the best of the first three in the series; it seemed like the author took a break and came back to the story enlivened and refreshed.  Maybe because it was in the new setting and there were so many new characters, I just thought it was even better.  I liked the way it was ended and I don't know that I'll continue to read the series but as far as stories go, I've enjoyed this read tremendously.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This book was fine, but I will not buy these books.  I will get them from the library, if I have nothing else to read.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Addictive and fun game!  Great way to pass the time while waiting for my appointments etc.  I like games that make you think.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|If you are at a place in your life where you are open about what could come next, check this out. If you are in a rut and have grown tired enough to take another perspective seriously, read this book.<br /><br />I loved it. It put a name and for me a body to what slows, stalls, and otherwise derails my efforts to do something good with a day or a week or a year of life.<br /><br />If you are dark and cynical, like I was about nearly every bit of advice; this is not the right time for a read of this book. But put it on your list!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|GOOD MOVIE, BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT. A LITTLE SLOW MOVING AND VERY PREDICTABLE, BUT WORTH THE TIME.

B00AFROVQC|5.0|As I was waiting for the next book in A Song of Ice and Fire series to come out, I came across this series from a B&N email.  I was blown away from the start and with each cliff hanging ending I can't wait to buy the next.  Morgan builds a story that you never want to stop reading.  So for me I can't wait for March 15 to continue this epic journey.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I was looking for a Bingo game to play against a computer, but it seems one must access it through a Facebook account.  That should be clear in the description.  I don't  and won't  have Facebook.  This has been removed.  It really deserves a '0' because it is unplayable.

1455523550|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is by far my favorite author and although I have not finished the book yet, I am approaching the end of it. It's an amazing story as his books always are. I would say this is one of the darker books that he's written. It's a great book and I hope the movie will give it justice.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|I do not like this app. it was always making my kindle fire freeze up. so I uninstalled it.<br />I am utterly dissapointed<br />Claire
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series didn't grab me at first, but these characters are so interesting and the action is nonstop with many twists and turns. Each book of the series is an easy read but yet addresses sophisticated topics. A winning series. You wont regret buying these.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Amazon amazes me. They make great products and sell great products. This backpack was perfect for all my needs, it's comfortable when you have it on your back for long periods of time. It holds all my gear safely.<br /><br />It's also a good size and even better, a good price.
B009D95IJM|5.0|Its a great book , Cat lovers unite , you will love this , all the comics I seen on the internet don't do it justice, this is a must for any cat lover , or CRAZY CAT LADY
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best games that I have ever played and all my other friends love this game,this game is like my life because I play it all the time , more than the other games.
B000IKQK7E|3.0|It's not a lose guideline or suggestion by Amazon. They mean business, people. I turned it on the first night. Friend called, went out. Next day, I was like: sure let's watch Animal House yeah! 35 minutes in, juuuuust when things were getting good, cut off!<br /><br />Bummer. But they say 24 hours, they mean 24 hours...
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This was a really good book.  It shows you that appearance doesn't matter.  I think this would be a good book for anybody to read.  It has a great variety.  Sci-fi, action, adventure, romance.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved everything about this series--I am addicted.  I couldn't wait for next season. I wouldo recommend it to everyone.
B0049IWQJW|5.0|My wife and I watch this whenever it it on and now we can watch start to finish via Amazon Prime. It never gets old!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great show, like the X Files or Twilight Zone with more interesting characters. Can't help but watch at least there in a row.
B0061US58C|5.0|My wife and I watch this whenever it it on and now we can watch start to finish via Amazon Prime. One of the few sequels that is as good as the first one!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The acting, costumes and the castle are all wonderful. I especially like how it portrays the &#34;new technologies of the day...the telephone, cars and typewriters. It deals with the changing attitudes towards women's rights and class distinction. The acting really pulls you in and has you hating certain people and rooting for others. A refreshing show given all the lame crap that is on TV today
B002ZBRSIY|5.0|My wife and I watch this whenever it it on and now we can watch start to finish via Amazon Prime.

B0012GMUPE|1.0|Sony took a great album and recorded it to digital using a $20 analog to digital converter, with the result being that this cd sounds like you are listening to it on a $20 radio.  It is the poorest audio quality cd I have ever heard.  Will see if I can return it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Unpredictable, just when you think you know where Martin is heading with the storyline it totally changes direction. Can't wait to read the next book.
0670878014|5.0|Whole Story books are wonderful and a great way for anyone of any age to read a classic story.  There are quality pictures, photos, drawings and information on every page and these make the story come to life and make it more interesting for those younger readers that may not like to read as much.  I have never found another line of books quite as good as these, I wish there were more in the Whole Story line, and they did a great job with the Frankenstein story; it is the original story, with explanations and the drawings on the sides panels, beautifully done.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|definitely a good read.....makes you appreciate more the folks who put their lives on the line for America everyday.....and like even less those in our government who diminish their sacrifice or fail to support them because of expense or personal agenda.....the last few pages in the last chapter are almost haunting...

030758836X|4.0|I finished this  book yesterday and I'm still trying to form an opinion about it.<br /><br />Here's what I liked for sure: This book it was amazingly, phenomenally well written. The plot? Extraordinary. The characters? Well-developed and interesting (to say the least). The subject matter? Fascinating. There is no doubt that Gillian Flynn is one talented writer.<br /><br />Here's what I'm not sure I liked (without giving too much away): I understand fiction is just that, fiction. But this book is so unbelievable in parts that it borders on ludicrous.<br /><br />Here's what I know for sure: It doesn't matter what I like or don't like about this book. You should read it anyway.<br /><br />I also know this for sure: This book is one of a kind. People will be talking about it for a long time to come and for good reason.
B009JBZH54|5.0|A great price for a superb Trilogy!  FYI this does not include any iTunes digital downloads which would have been a great addition.  I knew it when I bought it though.
030746363X|4.0|I always prefer buying new products over used, so I filtered my options to show only new. There I got this book, however I can obviously tell by the crinkles in the pages and a slight color pencil mark on one of the pages that this book has undoubtedly been used... ehh -1 star
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Overall, I liked the Lincoln Lawyer and Matthew McConaughey but it was a bit too violent at times.  Loved the scenes where the bikers pulled the lawyer over to chat.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I was surprised at how good this one was. I think it lived up to the hype a rare thing imho.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Watched the series when it aired and bought as a gift for my mother-in-law. Great entertainment value. Think I'll borrow it back from her and re-watch it. Really, really enjoyed the story. So well done.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|What is there to say, its walking dead season three, you either like it or you do not like it.<br /><br />Actually if I were to be honest, I think the show has always been on the verge of great but has never made it.<br /><br />I don't mind them taking their time in developing story lines, and building up the drama. I don't mind the episodes where we get sidetracked.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on it, I just think its good. I personally could do with out the excessive  gore, but to each his own.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this show and it's characters and i love the fact that amazon had all the shows and the seasons that it's been airing!!

B0089LOKHG|2.0|I loved the first two books of this series, which made this last one so dissapointing. i was so invested in the whole love triangle prospect but after a whole series of lena falling for two guys lauren oliver completely rushes the end and doesnt fully specify who lena ends up with. not to mention the fact that just because they were successful in Portland doesnt mean the entire rebellion is over. I hoped that by the end the author would say how the whole uprising turned out and whether tey had succeaded or not, and that she didnt rush the end with Alex and Julian. lastly i wish that lena could have found some way to save hana by either finding a cure for the cure or something.<br />i know tat this series was a trilogy and that this was the last book but i wish there had been some sort of epiloque on how everything turns out.<br />overall i am sad and dissapointed with the ending of this series.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|A lot of fun with my grand sons.  Very easy to use and play. Would recommend to all parents or grandparents.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Fun to watch, but felt a bit formulaic with a typical hollywood ending.  Character development was so-so and Ben Affleck gave a decent performance with his typical two facial expressions.  It was decent but I don't know about best picture quality.

B009WJ14FA|4.0|Vintage Trouble is a great throwback blues-inspired rock band that sounds oddly refreshing and innovative. This debut session is nothing short of brilliant. Stellar guitars, solid rhythm section, peppered with lead vocals that remind you of Hendrix in his heyday. Forget all the computer-generated pop fluff that record labels are selling these days ... this is the real deal!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I was crazy about this series back when it was new, I am sooooo happy that I can see it again.  Thank you Amazon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the second time for reading Hunger Games. The first time I read it with my daughter. This time it was for me.  It is an awesome book that never slows down. Poor Katniss, the pain she goes through from having to grow up too fast in a cruel world. Peers whose innocence is just refreshing. I just love Eddie, Haymitch,and Cinna.  I have recommended this book so many times. Will probably even read it again.
B009I2UH2W|3.0|Very excited to get this for our new iPhone. Had it in the CRV and could not get it into the power jack.<br />Had to use it in the truck first and then it pushed into the CRV jack. Very tight. Thought I would have to send<br />back, but it worked just fine after I got it pushed in.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is the best app I have on my kindle! I am constantly trying something new that I never would have thought of!
B002N9MK8G|5.0|I'd never really listened to him before, being a rock n roll kind of guy, but the performance of him and the band blew me away. Now I'm a Sinatra fan.
1407130366|5.0|great read , i stayed up late read all three books in 24 hours becouse i couldnt put them down i had to see what was next well worth the time
B009FZFONO|5.0|Very good show. Wish we  would have watched  when it started. We rented shows to catch up to the recent series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app just a superb and realistic feel to it. al though the graphics might cause it to lag sometimes still an amazing app. cheers to the app maker they should make more like this
1451695195|4.0|Well-written and compelling. I have read this book w/ 'gifting' copies of this book... in mind....to several family members and friends.  Book content stays with you.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great book! Many thanks to Marcus Luttrell and those like him who make the ultimate sacrifice for our great nation
0062082353|5.0|This book is about Chris Kyle (God rest his soul, R.I.P. Warrior). The Devil of Rahmadi with 160 confirmed kills of terrorists.
B00B2064IY|4.0|Some really good tracks on this release. Jimi is timeless and the sound quality is actually very good. Recommend for any fan!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is addicting, challenges the mind. If you ever get stuck, turn your screen another direction and sometimes you will see it right away. Great game!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|The writers are geniuses, the plot twists are creative, and the story-telling seems fresh even after so many seasons.Hopefully they keep this up.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Season two of Game of Thrones is just as thrilling and engaging as the first.  The production values, acting, script, and overall maintainence of the integrity of the source material is still very satisfying.  Given the complexity of the books and the labyrinthine plot the writers do a very good job of telling all the sub plots clearly and making you care about even the most despicable of characters.  I'd love to see the &#34;extended&#34; cuts of all the episodes with all the scenes that were probably elimnated because of time contraints.  I only wish they had a way of linking/subtitling each storyline via a sort of &#34;calendar&#34; or dating the way Tolkien did in Lord of the Rings.  Then one could more clearly understand each event in a temporal context.  Such as:  Meanwhile across the sea, or a few weeks later, or the following spring...etc.  But I quibble.  I can't wait for the next season to begin.  I don't have cable so I have to wait for the DVDs to be released and relish them all in a marathon session.
B009ZE27US|3.0|this app is so dumb...<br />i'm not even__and it told me i'm 56<br /><br />but it made me laugh so hard!!!!!!<br />get it or don't (i know that doesn't help)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game. I wish that you could do western things like roping and cutting though. it could also use things to make the game more appealing. For instance you could have your horse ranch Linda thing with roping cattle and things like that.
1577314808|4.0|My therapist recommended this book to me.  It took a bit of work to get through, but it left me with some new ideas on how to be more present in everyday life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game. Highly recommended for horse lover's. I love how you can interact with the horses and play with them.
B007HIEBV2|5.0|The whole cd was great, the music is so unique and a very original idea. I really enjoy listening to them and look forward to buying their next album.
B00005Y7LD|5.0|I Always enjoy the music of Billy Idol and this cd is one of his very best. It is worth the purchase.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a very long time - could not put it down! The twists and turns had me hooked from the first page.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Have always loved the Castle series. The books are as clever and funny as the TV show. If you like murder mysteries and the TV Castle series, you will like this book
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love this game, I had bought it on my IPhone, but I had gotten a new phone, but i had a kindle so i bought it on here so I wouldn't have the same problem again
B00A8KJN14|5.0|this film is a good example of stop motion animation. The characters are life like in all aspects. great movie to rent or buy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm so thankful that there are many versions of this game that are for free. I am a major fan or solitaire and enjoy playing it
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Love this free game, but the further you get into the game the dearer kibble charges for pets houses etc which can take weeks to get a new house it give you offer to use actual money to buy kibble but is very expensive. But over all a good game for kids me and my daughter's love it
B007TXN4TK|2.0|It was cool, and I understand the reason behind it, but I didn't like that the better songs had to be bought. But like i said I understand the necessity for such things
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The most awesome book I have ever read. Lots of action and suspense. Very interesting book. It is so good I think I am going to read it again.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I know it's my fault for doing this, but  I wish it had monsters, where i can play and not just build
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series was great, their was action and adventure. It was truly an amazing  series.  The odds  wont always be in your favor.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love this game, hate that it's only the demo, but still. I'm willing to start anew in a different world.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book is a great page turner! It's amazing what someone will do when jealously is involved. Makes you wonder how much of this goes on in real life.  Gone girl by Gillian Flynn was also excellent.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Great book for anyone interested in how powerful churches &#34;controlled&#34; thinking for literally centuries in order to maintain their position of dominance and wealth over most of the civilized planet.  Eminently readable ..
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its so awesome and WORTH sever BUCKS I have nothing to say so get this app and I would also.recommend C.H.A.O.S which is a fun helicopter fighting game with great graphics
B000JIHP88|3.0|I have 4 month old twins and they are just about ready to start enjoying a musical mobile.. I had a hand-me-down manual winni-de-pooh mobile which I used on the kids since they were 2.5 months.. And they loved the soft music and the figures revolving around the mobile.... The manual winding however barely runs the mobile for approx10 secs, and as my kids loved it so much,I thought I'll buy a battery operated one... When I received this, I thought it was beautiful.. Vibrant colors, the palm fronds moving up and down, and the remote.. HOWEVER , my kids did not enjoy it as much.. The animals are way too close to each other, there are just too many things clustered together...and the strings from which the animals hang are way too short.....they will stare at the manual one which is simpler, just 4 animals on a longer string , it helps them distinguish the figures easily.. My twins adore the manual mobile, a musical mobile is a must have on anyone's crib.. Just the sight of seeing happy babies is worth the little money spent... But this one just doesn't cut it as much.. The music however is nice, still not as nice as the manual one, and I felt the sound was a little low ..
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Different than other running games because sometimes you have to slow down. Have to think about it! Good game all around
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was awesome I just wish I could have played more but I have to buy it the rest of TO play it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game to pass the time. Very addicting and love the updates that change up the play scenery. Whenever I pick it up I can't put it down.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This film was so entertaining! Grampa and I watched it with our 10 year old granddaughter. We all laughed so hard! The characters are great! I'm sure we'll rent it again soon. . . maybe even buy it one day. Thank you.
B000SGSU58|4.0|I enjoy the many twists and turns in Connelly's books. I'm looking forward to reading the next one. Keeps your interest until the last minute.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Almost like real. Very realistic. The are so many things to do. I especially like the competitions. The feeding is also very cool.
0802473156|5.0|This book is an amazing eye-opener! It is geared toward married couples, but the principles can be applied to any relationship, really, even friendships. It illustrates how people interpret \\"love\\" in different ways, be it spoken words, acts of kindness, touch, gifts, or time spent. Personally, it was very enlightening for me to finally understand, despite what I thought were my best efforts, why my boyfriend of 3 years had pulled away from me! I didn't convey my love for him in the way he needed to hear, and he wasn't giving me what I needed either. Now that we've both read the book (given to us by a counselor), we are back on track, laughing and touching again, and optimistic about the future!<br />It is written by a Christian counselor, and makes occasional religious references, but very few and is not preachy at all...so if you're a Freethinker, don't hesitate. Get the book if your relationship is in trouble!! It's worth every penny!!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good exciting movie, action packed.  I would like to see this guy do another one. The end is as if there could be another one.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have to say I enjoy most of Grisham's books, predictable as most may be. Some of those I have read recently are not as predictable, and this one falls in that category. As most of his books, it is a page turner, and has a great redeeming ending, but does not have the excitement of the seminal \\"The Firm\\", \\"The Runaway Jury\\" or others of that kind. If you are a Grisham fan, I would recommend this book, but because I do not rate it as his best, I gave it only 4 stars.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is so interesting to see how people (of all social status) lived during that period of time.  Also, I have learned to love and hate the different characters!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|If you are a Nelson DeMille fan, then you read them all, because they are all good. Thank you Mr. DeMille, for your story-telling skill and sense of humor. I wait patiently for your next work.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Whoever is fan of good music from 80's 60's and a mix of Motown and Michael Jackson would enjoy this album.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead has been a fantastic show from day one. Full of intense suspense, gore, drama, and even a  splash of humor (on occassion), the show just keeps getting better and the plot keeps thickening. A must see!
B0014BY72Q|4.0|I really liked Logan's Run movie. It is an excellent sci-fi movie about a futuristic society run by a computer that kills you off when you turn 30, presumably to control the population. Most people seem to be jobless and just live with pleasure in mind. Concepts like marriage are unknown in society. The \\"carousel\\" method of execution is glamorized as the only possible way to survive (renewal) past 30 but a number of people don't buy that and that is when the computer sends in the Sandmen to terminate them. The first hour or so of the movie goes by pretty quick but the last hour drags a little. I highly recommend this movie !!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I sincerely believe that this book should be in everyone's library. I would recommend this to everyone as it was so insightful to me, and I believe there is so much in this book I wish I had known about earlier in my life.
1400049628|5.0|Good book. Reads like a technical manual. It's not on fictional undead alone.<br />Read between the lines ( as it were)
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This is not a book for sell only it is  information detailed step by step instruction information about a subject you are interested in.. You will want to take this book with you into the field to learn, test, improve your  knowledge  ability, and take it home with you for sure keep it handy for referance. Take this book with you to an subject area simpler to to that of the book set up your tripod and let the instructior leed you through the steps.
141694737X|5.0|My 16 month old son is very fascinated with the lift the flaps on the pages revealing the animals in the crates on all the pages. He has brought me this book from the bookshelf himself several times since it arrived in the mail. A great book for kids who love to be read to!!
B004ZJZQFG|5.0|U-571 is one of those good old war movies, the kind of which they just don't make any more.  I would rank it right up there with \\"Hunt For Red October\\" inasmuch as the action sequences and drama.  Matthew McConaughey portrays the diffident Lieutenant Tyler, affronted by the fact of being passed-over for an opportunity to command his own vessel, who is instead charged with a top-secret mission... the outcome of which may hold in its balance the outcome of World War II. You really do catch yourself getting into the moment by moment suspense as the movie unfolds.  Supported by such solid actors as Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton, David Keith, and Jake Weber, this tale receives two thumbs up!
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Made me think about life from a different perspective. Original idea from a great author. What if you did not age?
B009K86D86|4.0|Enjoyed it and my husband is rethinking the way he looks at food!  A must see if you're concerned about where your food comes from!
6302158095|5.0|fun to watch - great if you have kids over to visit  - - - - - - - -
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|Ever since I was a child I have adored this movie. I am a dedicated cat lover (haha) so of course I recommend this movie to other cat ladies/ men. It is incredibly cute and brings me straight back to my childhood.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|It's Jane Austen - a classic is a classic - - - - - - - - - - -
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Besides the commercialized Pop nature of Thrift Shop, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis brings back a pure sense of hip hop, reminiscent of A Tribe Called Quest, Pharcyde, and Fugees in which they focus on relevant social issues.  The song that is the most prolific on the album and stands out the most is Same Love.  Awesome album.
B007HJ96NO|5.0|I first saw this in 1990. I enjoyed it then, but really loved it this time as I was able to appreciate it more. I loved the characters, makes me want to go back to Italy.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I am Big huge fan of Audrey Hepburn!  One of my favorite movies all time along with the Breakfast in Tiffany, Sabrina, Roman Holidays....  I am glad that I have a copy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very realistic and the graphics are great!! This is defenatly for every horse lover!  i would highly reccomened this game!
B005HSGB6W|4.0|One of my favorites since I was in high school. We read it in AP English, and I read it over every year or so. Can you find compassion within the worst of society? Can we all feel the potential for the ultra violent just under the surface in ourselves?
B000I14UTS|4.0|The acting, music, and choreography in this movie have all withstood the test of time. In addition, the picture it gives of the rise of Nazism is of special interest, especially in view of the current interest in all things related to World War II.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game i would reconmend it to gamers who love temple run. You should get it people. Trust me.<br /><br />  ~MINECRAFTgal
0553801473|5.0|My husband was pleased. He really enjoyed the set and is waiting for the next one. It was in great condition
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I love the story of My Fair Lady and this DVD has brought me many hours of pleasure and entertainment..
B009FZFONO|5.0|I came across this series only a few months ago. And was able to watch Season 1 & 2 with no commercials ... over a long weekend.<br /><br />Then couldn't wait for Season 3 on netflix, so thankfully Amazon provides a solution ... purchase access for like $1.50 per episode and watch it day after it airs...<br /><br />Rather than use my PC, I setup the Amazon movie app on my xbox 360 and watch it in comfort!
0374531269|5.0|This is a very revealing book and I am glad I have read it and learned about the terrible pain and sufferng that exists in other parts of the world.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Its like Walking Dead, but with Aliens instead of zombies! even though its about alien invasion, majority of its spent relating to the people dealing with normal human problems. Like food or moral of actions when under stress situations. And its all about survival!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's. good! I love it. lots of activities.  fun game to play again and again.  great for young children.I love. the horses there so cute!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator!  Easier to use than the one on my laptop.  Easier to read than the one on my smartphone.<br />The best for doing my taxes.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I missed this when it was in the movies but went to see Expendables 2 so I had to have this one.  It was shipped and received quickly and was exactly as described.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|dazzling cast.  compelling storyline. sucks you in and keeps you wanting more.  it's our special treat to ourselves.  we came late to the show but are sold.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Triffic super cool amazing good awesome great glory go<br />This game is so cool said the pups and jelly beans are the pups and cre and cream
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so awesome!!! until it wont load at times. but other then that,once up and running its a cool game. fun mini games.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Interesting story and an ending that will leave you thinking you understand until suddenlyit hits you what just happened.  Only drawback is that the beginning chapters were way too filled with unnecessary description and filler.
0062082353|5.0|This is the history behind America's most lethal sniper. Covers the man thru his life upto just before his tragic death. Extremely interesting historical book.
B00BP4X3W2|4.0|If you do not like movies that are sure to make you cry this is not the movie for you. However, if you don't mind crying and love a good war movie that is fairly historically accurate then you must watch this movie. And if you like the movies &#34;War Horse&#34;, &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; and &#34;The Pianist&#34; then this movie has got to be added to your list.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I wasn't to fast to buy it because it was fifteen dollars but it was worth it. it runs great on my kindle fire and it is a full final fantasy game easily forty.plus hours of gameplay. if your a final fantasy fan then this is a perfect buy
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is fun and the graphics are really good. It would be nice if you could earn more gems for the tasks that you have to complete...other than that, I like it
B009PK9SB8|3.0|I would have probably rated this higher,but in my case, I had my GoPro Hero3 Silver fully updated to the latest update, and then as soon as I placed the screen on the back of the camera, my device bricked and would not come on or send a signal. But hey, at least GoPro has decent customer service and is sending me a new one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am hooked on this it really stimulates the  mind and it is a challeng, I will play it almost everyday.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app.  I watch videos while i am walking on my treadmill.  Sure beats listening to music!  I would recommend this app to everyone!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It dosen't matter good or bad it is my favorit writer.  I will have to say I didn't want to put it down it held my attention and I would recomend it very highly.  If this is your first book by John you will be hooked.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Zero Day was my first Baldacci book that i have read.  I really got back into reading from Allan Schatz and when i needed another book to read, i moved to Baldacci at my father's insistance.  Good move by me.  Great plot, great characters.  It made me feel a part of the story.
B00004YRQA|3.0|The one I got was all in Japanese . I don't know why but I couldn't get it too work . My PS2 wouldn't read it . So I move save files from an older card too this one and that seem too fix it . ( whatever , it works now )
0307913090|5.0|No but seriously, here's my review:  I got this for my mom for Christmas because she listens to a lot of books on CD, but I wasn't sure she would like it because she doesn't really like gore and sex and all that.  She's read the Diana Gabaldon books and liked those, but she's not a 50 Shades kinda gal.  Ok I just feel dirty saying that.<br /><br />Anyway, the long and short of it is she reads all the best sellers and that sort of thing and she liked this, said the narrator was also really good and as someone who buys lots of books on CD she was glad they are so long because you feel like you get more for your money.  Even though it was my money.  She birthed me so I guess that's really her money isn't it?  What we were talking about?  Yeah this review kind of sucks doesn't it?  I just invalidated the right of personal property in an Amazon review.  Adam Smith's gonna be pissed.
0525478817|4.0|Despite some reviewers not finding the character's voices believable, I found it refreshing to take on death in such a direct way. No one really knows how another person feels who has gone through this. Most adults have nevered considered life and death in a way that these kids have so to say they don't speak like \\"real\\" teenagers is just wrong. They are not real teenagers. They are dying and they know it. A sweet, tragic love story. I recommend it.
B002U3CCF6|1.0|The novel Sharp Objects was a bleak read bulked out with monotonous information. If I hadn't read Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl which suffers from the same affliction i.e. unnecessary padding, but still  manages to be a great read, I never would have downloaded Sharp Objects.
B00942G4UA|5.0|An eye opening, in-depth look at where our food comes from and how it's made. From GMO grains, to antibiotic and ammonia treated meat, this film exposes many hidden hazards that the food industry doesn't want you to know about.<br /><br />MUST SEE!
B0086HGW42|5.0|This album is fantastic both lyrically and instrumentally. If you don't know Shareen's style, it's on the slow side of what's out there today and focuses on three main things: an expertly played guitar, a sweet but solid yet semi raspy voice, and beautifully written lyrics. His lyrics often have difficult, quick rhythms that almost resemble rap.<br /><br />I love this album. It's definitely one for rainy days and days of solitude or reflection.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I'm only half way through this book at the moment but it's one of the best reads I found in a long time.  If I had to describe it I'd say it reads like a cross between &#34;The good soldier Svejk&#34; and Forest Gump, with lots of light hearted murder along the way.  Absolutely outstanding!
B00846REIS|5.0|I am reading it a second time because I liked it so much.  I cannot wait until the new one comes out in June.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book. Recommend it to anyone looking for a different new read, very well written with wonderful character Developement and growth
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great season. While the ending was disheartening, I look forward to how this show will evolve. The characters in this drama are so interesting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Straightforward and easy to use, just like a hand-held calculator, but bigger.  That's all I have to say at this time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a hard series to describe, but it is completely addictive. The cast and the writing are just fantastic.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe is the most exceptionally written and directed and performed and everything I would ever want in a sci-fi program.<br />It is so good, it is like a piece of good dark chocolate - only need to nibble on it a little at a time. Watched 2 shows last nite - but it was midnight, so I went to bed and slept soundly.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|I was in love with her voice and when I heard the whole cd, I was going to not only buy it but love it too.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Another great season of Downton Abbey.  The only downer was the untimely death of Matthew at the end of the last episode.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Hard to put down and like all Reacher worth reading.  The story is great and proves he has a heart, besides a desire to take out  bad guys.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The Fire can lie next to your work and be easily visible...No need for reading glasses or a special pen due to the large size of the buttons.  A pleasure to use.
0689835604|5.0|My 8 mo old grandson loves this book and his older sister loves to read it to him. He hasn't managed to tear any flaps off yet!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|this is an excellent series with a great sit of actors.  the behind the scenes plots are intriguing.  i wish there were more episodes than just a few seasons
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Enjoyed this movie - always love Judy Dench! The rest of the cast was good as well. It was nice to see another culture and the diversity along with the comedic reactions of of the &#34;foreigners&#34;. Made me laugh
B0079XPUOW|5.0|The main story of this book is hilarious and a wonderful tribute to the Star Trek universe, and will be entirely enjoyable to anyone with at least a passing familiarity with it, in the vein of other parodies such as the movie Galaxy Quest.  The three &#34;Codas&#34; are less interesting, and in my opinion the book would have been better without them, but they don't actively detract from the experience.  Don't go into this expecting Dumas or Tolstoy, but take it at face value and it's well worth your time (and money).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the detailed sets.  The whole story gives you pause to think how they all fit into a rather complicated lifestyle system.
B0037LXTUW|4.0|After a few rounds of Dixit going through the deck, my group of friends got to know the cards well and got a bit bored with the game.  This helps keep the variety up by adding even more cards.  The price is a bit steep, but if you like the game, you'll like the expansion.
B0037RBVG0|5.0|This is a truly great album, not because it was his last, or because I want it to be, but because the music is great.  These songs were not scrapped pieces of studio material our outtakes that were thrown together to make a posthumous album.  They were perfectly crafted and finished songs.  He did a wonderful job of using the studio to create a complete, textured sound without overdoing it.  I know that he spent a lot of time and worked hard on this album, and it really shows.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|The PS controller should come standard with these. Makes hitting the L2 and R2 buttons much easier. For the price, you can't beat these.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've been really happy with this sharpener.  I use an old Gerber blade with a serrated edge on the inside of the end of blade and was able to sharpen that up quite well. Quickly put an edge back on a bunch of old knives I had for fishing.  Not sure how long this will last, but it was worth it already.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|One of the best series I have watched.  I would highly recommend watching it. .  The books are fantastic too!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This is by far my favorite recent Bond film.  I thought it was excellent and exciting to watch.  I was only sorry I had rented it, if I had known how good it was I would have bought it to watch again.

B002SSBD6W|5.0|He is an outstanding writer and presents a thorough argument without being sanctimonious or idealistic.  He states very clearly that he understands why most people love eating meat and why many think ethical omnivory would be preferred to straight vegetarianism.  But he absolutely BLASTS the factory farm system and makes it difficult for meat-lovers (like myself) to defend pouring money into companies that (1) devastate fragile ecosystems (2) incubate potential pandemics (3) act as a vehicle for toxins and hormones to get into human bodies and (4) institutionalize torture of sentient beings.<br /><br />I was a bit distraught after reading this and actually went vegetarian for a month and a half.  I am a life-long meat eater and, frankly I was upset to have something so pleasant and effortless become conflicting and guilt-inducing.  But in the long-run, he convinced me that factory farming has to go and divestment appears to be the best way to do it.  Now its just a matter of ending my own hypocrisy and fighting three decades of culinary conditioning and finding a way to break free of the spell that easy, tasty, convenient, unethical meat has me under.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was actually a Valentine's Day gift for my wife, (hey, it's what she wanted...) and I've never necessarily been a fan of &#34;Harry Potter&#34;, but when I watched these movies with her, I really got into them. I thought they were very exciting and adventurous to watch. The storyline is very original and interesting in every movie, the scenery in which the movies take place is beautiful, and the cinematography is also excellent! Given the price I paid for this set of movies, I thought it was a very good deal!

These are truly some bad brothers and this is a classic album that every lover of hip hop should have in their collection. Rebel without a Pause, Don't believe the Hype and Terminator X to the Edge of Panic are a few of my favorite cuts.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|I know... my header makes no sense.<br />So Supernatural followed a formula, but much like X-Files, that formula was to address different phenomena/myths each episode.<br /><br />While I still like Supernatural now, they've switched formats.  Now they focus on a single non-varied plot line each season, and focus more on relationships (which makes it feel more like a soap opera).<br /><br />In my opinion, the first few seasons were superior to the later ones.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not super uplifting but very interesting and engaging read. I couldn't put it down! I was worried it might be too gory for me but it was fine. I would recommend to pretty much anyone.

B00005PJ6M|5.0|I know this movie is stupid & cliched, but I love it.  I actually love this one A LOT more than the original movie.<br />I rarely like sequels better, but this one has a better plot, WAY better production value, some great imagery, and some excellent additional characters.
B00B2DSIAI|2.0|I'd give this more stars if it had Ukrainian audio track. Also if it came with big bottle of vodka! What? my Ukrainian kids don't deserve to watch movie or drink something to help them sleep? Shame on you, Disney!
B008DKBO8G|5.0|This is the second of these I have purchased. One for my kindle paperwhite and another for my moms kindle touch. They are well sewn, padded and the lining is soft to prevent scratches. The velcro closure is properly sewn down on all sides and is sized right to close and open nicely. This fits right in my purse or bag and I travel with it constantly. After two years the original purchase is still clean and in great shape. I believe the tightly woven outer shell is treated with a fabric protecter /water repellant. I also like the fact that it is not obviously a kindle cover it just looks like a small bag. Nothing to steal here folks.
B007HJ9NBE|1.0|This version doesn't hold a candle to the original.  Julianne Hough was totally annoying.  We turned it off 40 minutes in.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It is hard to say that the book was bad ,it grips you and pulls you in ,has you on the edge of your seat and you don't want to put it down. UNTIL you get to the last four chapters and the story just falls flat and the ending was so bad I wanted to throw the book out of disappointment, I understand that I am not the only reader who has felt that way.<br /><br />I suggest reading it and forming your own opinion, some may like the twist where I hated it.
B0012TWRAO|2.0|When I received my unit, I noticed exceptional marring and paint loss around the ball mount. After speaking with customer service, they told me this is a normal characteristic due to the manufacturing process. For a pricey piece of hardware, one would think it would have a higher quality finish.<br />Functionally, it works well...unfortunately, the item's appearance is poor.

B007VDN1PA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo30PS08LUYIJFY]]My Dad was a photographer.  As he got older he transferred many of his photos and copyrights to me but there still remained a rather huge number of slides and negatives when he passed several years ago.  As a result, my youngest daughter, who inherited the photography bug from her Grandpa, and I each have a very large plastic storage bin full of slides and negatives that we've been wanting to digitize for preservation's sake.  If you've ever priced out having this commercially done, then you know that it can be very expensive.  Getting all the slides scanned is a project that has been nagging at my daughter for some time now, so not long ago she sent me a link to a slide scanner remarkably similar to this one, suggesting that it might just be the perfect birthday gift.  So, when DB-Tech asked me to  evaluate this [[ASIN:B007VDN1PA DB-Tech 35mm Film Slide and Negative Scanner - 5 Mega Pixel Film to Digital Image Converter - with 2.4-Inch LCD and TV-Out]] I was happy to agree.<br /><br />The scanner arrived one day last week and after I took a gander at the contents of the box and read through the manual off it went to my daughter's house and that huge bin of slides.  She scanned over 300 slides in just a couple of hours, then on Saturday instead of our usual bake-a-thon we scanned most of the remainder and made this little video showing the [[ASIN:B007VDN1PA DB-Tech 35mm Film Slide and Negative Scanner]]  while we were at it.  While we didn't get all of the film scanned, we did scan the entire bin full of slides.  I came across pictures I didn't even know existed, never mind pictures I haven't seen in fifty years!  What a treasure trove.<br /><br />As you can see, the scanner is very small and very easy to operate.  Do set the resolution at 10M rather than 5 for best print output.  While you can do minor manipulation of the images to some extent right on the scanner, I would recommend  Adobe Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro or GIMP for most manipulation as well as restoration, color corrections and red eye removal.  You can leave the scans on the SD card or transfer them to your computer or an external storage device.<br /><br />If  you have a big project in the works, you will also want some [[ASIN:B0008GMHEI Air Power Dusters]] and some spare [[ASIN:B00A6GROIO DB-Tech Replacement Film Holders for DB-FS150 Film Slide and Negative Scanner - 3x Strip Film and 1x Single Frame holder]].  One note about the film holders - while they look quite similar, notice that each is clearly marked on the bottom as being for a single frame or a filmstrip.  Also note the word \\"Front\\" embedded into one edge of the holder.  The holder goes into the machine with the word Front facing you so that you can read it.  Otherwise, it will not line up correctly to insert the film.<br /><br />Grandma's $0.02 - What a great little machine, one that made very quick work of a very large project.  Highly recommended.  (Now if it only scanned 11 x 14 inch photographs wouldn't I be a happy camper!)lation as well as restoration, color corrections and red eye removal.

B004XQYBA2|4.0|This has an easy interface and is a pleasure to play.  It has a good range of challenge levels and a large number of puzzles.
B003FSTN52|2.0|First, let me just say I think this series is brilliant. I love all the strong females, the acting is fantastic as is the writing. I have nothing bad to say about the show itself.<br />My problem is that I just put in the 4th disk and it will not play. I tried several DVD players, including a computer with no luck. None of the other disks had a problem, just the 4th. It is also the terrible timing because I just had surgery and was saving this series for my recovery... there goes that plan. Oh and I guess my window for returning or exchanging is up. I hope they'll do something to fix their problem for me.<br />So overall: 5 stars for the show, 0 stars for quality control.
B008JFUMT2|2.0|Just when you thought McClane had yippee-ki-yay'd his way out of police work, he manages to battle his way back from retirement, only this time his problems are a bit more international. After traveling to Moscow to help his wayward son, Jack (Jai Courtney), John winds up knee deep in a nuclear weapons heist. It's up to the two McClanes to put aside their differences and prevent a global outbreak of war. Add in Russian politicos, the underground crime scene and a dash of Chernobyl and you've got yourself quite the awesomely bad vacation.<br /><br />A Good Day To Die Hard is one of those awesomely bad action movies that's a mix of old school heroics and modern day technologies. But before I get into my review let me start by saying, this movie is really made for die hard fans of the Die Hard series. While it might be passable for something produced in the late 80's/early 90's, it would never fly past today's high standards. You really need to go into the movie with low/no expectations in order to come out satisfied because, in a word, it's ridiculous. I feel like each Die Hard movie is a little more over-the-top than its predecessor and now that we're on the 5th one, you can only imagine what that might entail. Exploding helicopters, massive car/tank chases through the busy streets of Moscow and expertly orchestrated prison breaks. You know, just a normal days work for the McClane family.<br /><br />Bruce Willis delivers all the iconic McClane lines and executes them with his trademarked squint and snarky attitude. And for a man of 57, you have to appreciate how he can still kick some serious ass. He embodies everything we come to expect from John McClane: the stubbornness, sarcasm and a take-charge now ask questions later method. What was lacking though was the father-son dynamic between him and Jack. Their relationship is anything but engaging and borders on frustratingly repetitive and hollow. I liked Jai Courtney well enough for an action guy but I just wasn't buying him as McClane Jr. Their relationship fluctuates between stony and warm fuzzies with little progression in between.<br /><br />As far as the cinematography goes, Moore had a more artistic vision in this film with slow-mo sequencing and well-framed shots, but I felt like for this type of movie, it didn't really work. Often it felt out of place, unnecessary and, at times, comical. I'm sorry but I'm there f or the action, not the art direction. What really worked in this movie, though, was the location. The change in scenery felt fresh and interesting. Sure, some of the old Russian communism &#34;us versus them&#34; mentality remains, but it works for all intensive purposes. I felt like they were able to get away with a lot of the outrageous action specifically because of the setting. It was in, no way, believable but I don't think it should be. All in all, A Good Day To Die Hard isn't the best action movie I've seen, but it's not the worst either. It hits all the marks of the traditional Die Hard film with all the cheesetastic, explosive, wry action that you could want. If you're looking for awesomely bad, then you've found it. Let's just hope that the franchise follows fast in McClane's footsteps and considers a long, hard retirement.<br /><br />Food for Thought: While nowhere as perfect as the original, A Good Day To Die Hard contains all the elements essential to make it a decent addition to the high-octane Die Hard saga. It's got a ridiculous plot, over-the-top action sequences, cheesy one-liners and a whole lot of yippee-ki-yaying which are essential to keep the 80's actiony feel. And while I did get a kick out of the movie, I can only hope that this was the end of an era and they let John McClane's adventures stop here.

B000YDE46Y|5.0|Very nice boot.  Very well made.  Sizes seem to run a little larger than normal, with a very large heel box.  Well constructed boot.  I had to put in a better insole, but at least I had the room.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Only ads show when you open the app and you can easily close them and proceed. Game itself is exactly what it says it is. Enjoyable solitaire game.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Basically, it is a matching game: Find the two blocks that match. I like that the cube is in 3D and you have to turn it all sorts of ways to find the different matching blocks. The matching blocks have to both be visible at the same time though.<br />It is a very fun game and easy to learn. I haven't played in a while, and I don't know if you can pause the game and come back another time. Game was very fun to play, but I'm still debating if it is really worth 99c.

B008MEM24S|5.0|I avoided downloading this app for the longest time because I became ridiculously addicted to the original, Where's my Water? Tried to make do with the free version of Perry, but that didn't cut it.<br />The concept of the game is very simple, get the water to Perry. Then you have to consider turning the water into ice or steam; turn sludge into lava or supercold water, etc. On top of that, I get to see the characters from Phineas and Ferb.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I loved the story but hated the writing style. I can usually jump between story lines easily but I found this one to be annoying. The twist was unexpected and kept me reading. I did not care for the ending.
B0090EIILU|3.0|I watched this movie because I actually like Sacha Baron Cohen movies, however this was one that had funny parts most of which was shown in the previews.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoyed watching the entire season.  The costumes and settings are spectacular.  The view of the English countryside brings back fond memories.

B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Dan Pink's writing style is conversational, educational and entertaining. If you fear sales or think you know what sales is all about, this is an eye-opening book. It is a quick read, but is best read 2 or 3 times, working through the case studies. It is a university course for the price of a book.

I STILL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST WATCHED THIS MOVIE WITH MY SISTERS AND COUSINS LATE AROUND 11:00PM AND WE LAUGHED SOO MUCH HAVING A GOOD TIME WATCHING THIS COMEDY. ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT'S A CLASSIC FOR ALL KIDS WHO WANT TO ENJOY THEIR PRECIOUS MOMENTS OF BEING LITTLE. I WATCHED IT MANY MANY TIMES WITH MY SON AND ALSO ENJOYED THE HAPPY BONDING TIME I SHARED WITH HIM. THESE HAPPY DAYS DON'T LAST VERY LONG WITH YOUR KIDS, SO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF A SMALL TIME.

B00AJMQSP0|2.0|What a major disappointment from one of the best German power metal bands ever!!!<br />This album is incredibly dull, uninteresting, and lifeless.<br />Which is a total contrast from the last album, 7 Sinners, which was incredibly heavy, different, fun and raw.<br />Aside from the first single - Nabatea - the only other track that is decent is one of the slowest they've done in a while - Hold Me in Your Arms.<br />Really bummed about it, wanted to like it... just can't.<br />It needs to go back to hell.

0385344228|4.0|The author takes his time introducing us to the principal characters<br />in this &#34;legal thriller&#34;, which makes the early part rather tough<br />going.  The longest part of the book, the months that they're waiting<br />for the trial, seemed particularly slow.<br /><br />Thrillers aren't my kind of mystery, as I prefer police procedurals.<br />But if the book had been tightly edited instead of stretching to almost<br />500 pages, it would have worked well.  Once I was half way or so in and<br />the trial started, it picked up.  And the ending was amazing, leaving<br />me thinking about it for days.  Be careful not to skip ahead.<br /><br />I also like reading books with large parts set just a few<br />blocks from me, in a building I've been in, although I didn't<br />hate it as much as the author did.  Anybody from Newton MA will<br />also find it appealing.<br /><br />So push through the first half to get to the intense part, and<br />you'll love it.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Saw this movie about a women's college accapella group  at the theater three times! The acting talent is amazing, the plot is excellent, and the singing and dancing is incredible.Best of all and surprisingly for any movie made today, it has some good old fashioned moral lessons about not judging others. Not just for young people, every generation in our extended family enjoyed this clever movie. Alcohol consumption portrayed, so may not be appropriate for grade school aged children. Some bad language and sexual references.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Films such as THE INTOUCHABLES come around far too seldom and when they do the public should somehow be advised that here is a cup of magic that could alter the manner in which we relate to each other and to the world tainted by schisms of societal errors. Written and directed by Olivier Nakache and &Eacute;ric Toledano the film was inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in `A la vie, &agrave; la mort', a documentary film. Of note, the book version of the film's story was written and released after the film enjoyed great success. Written by Abdel Sellou the book  `You Saved My Life' tells the extraordinary true story of the charming Algerian con-man' friendship with a disabled French aristocrat. Sellou's book shows the real man behind Sellou/Driss's smiling face. The book takes us from his childhood spent stealing candy from the local grocery store, to his career as a pickpocket and scam artist, to his unexpected employment as a companion for a quadriplegic. Sellou has never before divulged the details of his past.  In many interviews and documentaries, he has evaded or shrugged off the question of his childhood and his stay in prison, until now. He tells his story with a stunning amount of talent, with humor, style, and--though he denies that he has any--humility. Abdel Sellou now lives in Algeria with his wife and three children, where he runs a chicken farm. He remains close to Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who lives in Morocco with his second wife and two children.<br /><br />The cinematic version of this relationship is an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident the aristocratic intellectual Parisian millionaire Philippe (François Cluzet) is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude ex-con African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Philippe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance. Philippe, impressed that Driss is the only candidate who does not look at him with pity, challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Philippe and his employees, especially under the watchful and compassionate eye of the head of the house staff Yvonne (Anne Le Ny). As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life - and a chance to turn his passionate epistolary relationship with one Eleanore whom he has never seen into a chance at a second go at life.<br /><br />The only aspect of this film that is somewhat distracting is that the film opens with a car adventure involving both Philippe and Dris which is terrific film making and very funny but does make the film's beginning (after the credits) seem less surprising.  A very minor point, especially when the film ends with the same activity but this time drives it to an incredibly touching completion.  Highly recommended on every level: both François Cluzet  and Omar Sy are brilliant!

B007EECSFA|5.0|Couldn't stop reading this book. The author goes back and forth in time very effectively to tell a story of wartime (WWII) intrigue and romance and modern-day memories. Will eventually read all of Kate Morton's books.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|This was difficult to beat @ $1.99 for such double album (equivalent) filled with a combination of the voice and probably one of the finest bands in its genre.  Quincy Jones who wrote many excellent arrangements was conducting the Count Basie band that night.  A real treat.  The show also reveals Sinatra as a bit of a stand-up comedian... but the repertoire, including many of his gems make for a very pleasant listening experience.

It works very well and learns from you. I very highly recommend SwiftKey to everyone with an Android phone or tablet.
B00B2064IY|4.0|This collection brings to life many riffs and progressions that appeared later at Woodstock and the Rainbow Bridge album. It may not displace my favorite albums, however, I am delighted to have it.<br /><br />Now, if i could just figure out a quick way to get rid of the annoying Thwoosh sound that is at the start of each track on my Amazon MP3 album downloads.
B0098VXMNE|3.0|It's sad to say but this third season of Spartacus feels like a compilation of film left on the cutting-room floor.<br />The actors are fine the set design is fine, but the story has gone off in an uninteresting tangent.  The original Spartacus (season one) felt very claustrophobic, as the gladiators might have felt.  Now that they are free, they seem to be terribly<br />disorganized with all sorts of dissention among their ranks (if there were ranks, which there isn't).  Since it's difficult for the ex-gladiators to stay even remotely unified and organized, the Romans are able to weaken their ranks almost without effort.<br /><br />The weakness here is in the writing/script, which is a pity.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Very well written! I enjoyed reading about yet another experience shared by Heat and Rook. Must admit, couldn't help imagining Beckett and Castle as Heat & Rook as well as the entire  cast, which made the book even more special than it already is.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This movie would be a sleeper without the performance of Denzel Washington.  There is very little action (which is okay), but sometimes the dialogue seems to drag.  It's worth a watch even if it's not top listed.

0316228532|4.0|When I found out that J.K. Rowling was writing a novel for adults, I knew that I HAD to have it.  I know that the book has gotten a lot of flak for being \\"too dark\\" or not \\"as magical as Harry Potter,\\" but I have to say that I really enjoyed the book.<br /><br />It was described by J.K. as a \\"dark comedy\\", but I believe that the word \\"satire\\" would have been more appropriate. The story gives a look at the over-all character of small-town when it's suddenly rocked by the unexpected death of a local politician. The characters are easy to understand, because the facade presented by them reflect individuals that we all know, while the true nature of these characters display the age-old literary but of things not being always what they seem.<br /><br />Yes, it's a dark story.  It is not a light-hearted rainy-afternoon read; and if that it what you are looking for, I would not recommend this book.  However, if you are looking for a good novel (and you enjoy books like \\"East of Eden\\" or \\"Brave New World\\" where things are not necessarily easy or happy) this is really well-written book that I would most definitely recommend.

B00BLGXL3U|1.0|What I thought I was going to see was a film that hinted at the beginnings of scientology. What I got was a story about a alcoholic war vet with PTSD (Joaquin Phoenix) who reminded me of the perverted neighbor you don't want living next door. He was nominated for a Oscar and he should for the dramatic weight loss alone. I was bored but the husband lost it all together and snored through the entire thing. It's not the most boring movie I've ever seen --- well maybe it was. You could see three actors desperately trying to float this sucker, the sweat poured but in the end it was a snooze fest.<br /><br />Be forewarned there is female frontal nudity, masterbation and sand loving.
0316286850|5.0|I felt like this was a great investment for those who want to be make up artist. Gives great detailed step by step instructions to do certain looks. Info about industry tools and tricks to the trade.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|It's not often that the script is better than the actors playing the parts but I think thats what happened this time. Helen Mirren was spot on but sir Anothony Hopkins fired off his lines like maching gun Kelly fired off bullets. Hitchcock was always thoughtful with his words, he sort of mulled them over before saying them, Hopkins spewed them at the screen.<br /><br />We all know Alfred Hitchcock was heavy but he wasn't a blob. Hopkins make up looked like he stood there while someone lobbed play-doh at him, it was uneven and distracting.<br /><br />I still say watch the movie, the script fills in a lot of Hitchcock trivia. It's OK enough for me to want to watch it again.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|I fell in love with one song on this album before I bought it. I was so impressed with the rest I couldn't resist. Its the perfect marriage of old school jazz with modern influences and neo soul artist.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|It was sort of all over the place so you do have to pay attention or else your going to get lost. When I rented the movie I didn't know Joseph Gordon Levitt was the main character, he did a good job of acting like a younger Bruce Willis and until the credits rolled I didn't know it was him. Violence and lots of drugs.<br /><br />I'd watch it again.

B002QHH22O|5.0|Steel Panther is a hilarious parody of glam rock bands of the 80's. It nails the style while being a perversely funny experience and they deliver pretty great tunes in general. If you are looking for an introduction, this is probably their most solid album. &#34;Community Property&#34; being the song I would recommend to ween yourself in and find out what they are all about. Pretty much every song on it is great with the exception of &#34;The Shocker&#34; which I personally don't care for. If you enjoy some sex jokes and rock and roll this is the band for you.
B00AW8VUDG|3.0|Krokus has been lost and mostly directionless for several years now. On Dirty Dynamite they have reverted back to their &#34;One Vice At A Time&#34; sound and song structure wise. Why? It's hard to tell. This CDs first 5 songs are the AC/DC Bon Scott era playbook. And they all kick ass, despite not ONE original sounding riff or vocal. The second half of the CD sees the band moving forward with the songs gaining some depth and more than 3 chords. But here's the thing. EVERY song on this CD is great, but it's all been done before. Not counting AC/DC, Rhino Bucket and Jackyl do this style of in your face rock at probably a higher level. The bottom line is this, This CD rocks front to back, and should be played LOUD at a party. Is it the best Krokus has done?? Not by a long shot. What Krokus really should do is flat out COPY what they did on the classic &#34;Headhunter&#34; CD. The flow, song structures, and musianship on that CD made it one of the best CDs of the 80s, right up there with Accepts &#34;Balls To The Wall&#34; and AC/DCs &#34;Back In Black&#34;, and NOBODY said they sounded like AC/DC on Headhunter! If you like basic loud in your face Rock N Roll buy this CD. If you want to hear a GREAT Cd by a band with an original sound.....buy a new copy of Headhunter! - Headhunter, Eat The Rich, Screaming In The Night, Stayed Awake All Night, Russian Winter....bands would sell their souls to have all those songs on one CD!!
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|...than 99% of the new music that is hitting the market.  Yes, I am sure that what is on this disc is NOT the final realization of what Jimi realized, but what would you expect, these songs were cobbled together from rehearsal tapes.  That said, it is interesting to hear alternate versions to see how Jimi built up to the final product, which in many cases, he still wasn't satisfied with.  Good music that only leads us to continue wondering &#34;what if?'
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I do not like this format.  It is useless as it won't change anything.  I bought it it is mine even if I wouldn't have liked it.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|As a Terminator fan, I was very anxious to see how they continued the story.  I watched the first season pretty much straight through.  Good character development with John and Sarah.  I like the addition of Cameron.  A shame to know that this will end.

B005OT2YVA|5.0|Very awesome Movie Love it. The character of Optimus prime was very Awesome. I simply enjoyed the movie a lot
0307352145|5.0|I loved reading this book.  I wish I had this book when I was young as the society around me was telling me that I was not social enough.  I always loved the company of small groups where I could be open, laugh, share and feel safe.  As time went by, I became more ambivert because I stopped focussing too much on how I felt inside.  Introverts have a lot to offer.  My quiet nature helps me as I speak only when I have to say something compelling.  This may make me a man of few words but they are powerful in a gentle way.

B0089LOKHG|4.0|I loved this book. It was the most action packed of the trilogy. I had a feeling in book 1 that someone had betrayed Lena.  I am somewhat disappointed, however, as I feel there's just way too much left unanswered! What happened after the wall came down? Do Lena & Alex truly end up together in the end? What happens to Julian? To Grace? To Hana? To Tack-what became of him? All I have are guesses and assumptions, but I'd definitely love a book that tells the tale of after the &#34;Walls Fall Down&#34;. I think there's so much that could be told. I'm not satisfied with the brief glimpse of Alex & Lena reunited, reaffirmed in their love. There was just a tiny spot at the end, and it left me wanting MORE! One reviewer said this is DEFINITELY the end of the series. I disagree. I believe this could be just the BEGINNING of a whole NEW series, and I hope it is.
1455508977|5.0|one of the best books i've read in a long time. Really enjoyed this story and well am a new fan of Nicholas Sparks
B000SEI230|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks.I don't think he has written a book that I haven't cried though. This was one in the beginning I wasn't sure I was going to finish, but yet again he proved me wrong! Loved it!
B0089LOKHG|2.0|Warning: SPOILER!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I felt the book to be so rich in the beginning, yet scarce in ending of the story. You don't know what happens to Hana (whether she decides to live in the wilds, or gets attacked by vicous dogs and dies), or Raven (has she died? Or did she miraculously make it?), or Lena (Is she really going to stay with Alex? What about Julian? And Grace? And Bee?). I feel like it was just a fast ending and cutoff so much more that could've taken this book to the full five stars.<br /><br />Sorry Lauren, expected more from you :/
B005T87QCI|1.0|Well this game fails by not giving you a story mode.<br />It also fails in not given you the option to create your play right away you have to pay $1.<br />It also fails by having low quality graphics.<br />Let's not forget that the gameplay has more glitches than a game from 1990`s<br />In conclusion don't ever buy this game I know other comments say is good but is not.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is the 1st  book in awhile that was truly hard to put down. I am excited to read next book but I need to caught up on my sleep.

B005COO1X6|4.0|This story, with it's characters and their quick development, and the plot, is a King novel condensed into a short story. Well done.
B008JFUUQ2|3.0|I purchased this product with the digital copy so i may watch the movie on my kindle fire.  well so far I have not been able to load it and it requires wifi to watch.  so kind of pointless to pay the extra

B005LAIISA|5.0|This latest installment of Ice age will not disappoint. It is still very funny and adds some food for thought if watching it will a child. It gave me an opportunity to explain what is happening when the ice melts, and land shifts, etc. Very enjoyable, while mildly educational! Watched it will my 5 year old granddaughter and got lots of laughs while explaining what was happening. It also shows friendship, loyalty and kindness among the characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i think the book had a lot of emotion I was captivated by it. I liked the characters even though it was hard picturing them as teens with so much wisdom, but it's a book and anything can be a reality .

B007L6VR12|5.0|As a huge Wes Anderson fan, which I guess skews my opinion, Moonrise Kingdom does not disappoint. An engaging story, and visually stunning. A must have for my family's film collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's totally worth the money although I love the game it needs more things like buckets and flint and steel in creative and a use for red stone besides for the ore.  It's nice though because of updates that add more bricks that are in the computer
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Such a wonderful movie! Though this should come as no surprise. Tim Burton, once again, has made another enjoyable movie that you'll want to watch again and again. It has the perfect timing and momentum to it and the humor is just spot on. Of course there is also an amazing cast with a few of the obvious regulars as well as some new faces that fit really well into that Tim Burton look. The screenplay was written by Seth Grahame-Smith, the author of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, which seems terribly appropriate for a movie about a vampire in the 60s. For sure a must see!
0385733577|5.0|Such a great book. Immediately it sucks you in to a story where the Gods and myths we've heard of are real and there are immortals walking among us. It's a great mix of history, magic, and story. The characters are pretty well thought out and while you THINK you might now how it's all going to play out, you dont. This is the first book in a series of six and revolves around the life of Nocholas Flemel, his wife, and a set of twins. All fighting a group of Dark Elders and keeping a secret book hidden. I highly recommend getting this book. It's great for teenagers as well as adults.
B000IZA9PI|5.0|This movie was great,I have a lot of Star Trek dvd but I don't have this one and I think this is a winner.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I'm more of a pop person than folk person, but there were enough songs I liked on this to warrant its purchase. My wife and I have a hard time agreeing on music, (she's more into C&W), but we both like this one, so I can play it even when she's in the car. Bonus!
B005LAII8K|4.0|I found the story to be interesting, (but then, I'm a time travel geek, so your mileage may vary). The Blu-ray transfer and lossless sound were well done, so I'm a happy camper.
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|I like Bruno Mars, but like so many groups now, they seem to fill CDs with songs that require an advisory, not because it helps the music, but because they think it's expected. I'd buy the non-advisory versions, but they're hard to find, and cost nearly twice as much as the others. Come on, people -- you have to have versions for radio play, so why not make 'em available? Or better yet, break out a dictionary and thesaurus, and see if you can't find something else to sing? I know it requires a few more IQ points, but maybe you could spend a few of the dollars you make on some English courses.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great Read. Especially for anyone that dosnt understand what the military sacrifices every day. I would recommended this book to anyone who wants to know more about our military and Families.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|By now you know the story. Justin Hayward has a new album, too many years after his last effort, The View from the Hill. In the wake of The Moody Blues' Strange Times, December, and their participation in the Amazing Caves soundtrack, Justin Hayward emerges stronger than ever with a batch of top-quality songs, pristine vocal and guitar work, and more importantly a story to tell.<br /><br />Hayward welcomes us with \\"In Your Blue Eyes,\\" a breezy, upbeat song with a catchy melody, vivid lyrics and suspensive momentum. Swirling crescendos seemingly lift the song to a higher plane, only to be cleverly subdued by a mellow chorus and nearly-whispered vocals. Topped with Hayward's classic voice and melodic guitar rhythms, fills and leads, the song is satisfyingly dynamic and enjoyable. Hayward is known by fans for his strong album starters, such as \\"Your Wildest Dreams,\\" \\"I Heard It,\\" \\"Say It With Love,\\" and \\"English Sunset,\\" to name just a few. \\"In Your Blue Eyes\\" easily earns a place among those classics, and yet, it still manages to sound fresh and imaginative.<br /><br />\\"One Day, Someday\\" delivers on many levels. The arrangement features Hayward with a percussive rhythm on acoustic guitar accompanied by a simple, relentless drum beat and a moody bass line that is so good and sporadic that I want more of it. But that's the brilliance of the song (and the rest of the album for that matter); simplicity and restraint. The chorus introduces Anne Dudley's soaring orchestration of a strings ensemble that might sound overly corny if not for Hayward's ability to deliver sincerity in his vocals.<br /><br />\\"The Western Sky\\" is my favorite track. Those of you who are hardcore Moody Blues fans will surely recognize the sustained strings and sweeping harp that begins and ends the song, right? Well if not, you will find it at the very end of \\"Twilight Time\\" on Days of Future Passed. Hayward and his programmer Alberto Parodi clearly sampled it for \\"The Western Sky,\\" making it, intentionally or not, a sort of Easter egg for fans. The song is carried by excellent acoustic guitar playing and vocals by Hayward, not to mention an ethereal atmosphere created by subtle synthesizer pads and strings and eerie but beautiful background vocals by Tracey Ackerman. And how can I not point out the guitar solos, which mimic the tone and fuzz distortion that sound we all know and love from classics such as \\"The Day We Meet Again\\" and \\"How Is It (We Are Here)\\"? On this song and throughout the album, Hayward's lyrics are personal, focusing on relationships and everyday challenges, surprises, expectations and triumphs in life. He looks to nature for metaphors and in some places flashbulb memories that remind him of milestones in his life.<br /><br />\\"The Eastern Sun,\\" with its acoustic finger picking and stripped down arrangement, sounds like an evolved sequel to \\"Children of Paradise,\\" and would have fit seamlessly on The View from the Hill or any early Moody Blues album. \\"On the Road to Love,\\" co-written and performed with Kenny Loggins, carries the torch with an excellent melody and tasteful guitar runs. On a side note, Hayward's guitar solo at the end of \\"Words You Say\\" from Strange Times is very reminiscent of the music from the Top Gun soundtrack, which featured Kenny Loggins. I'm sure that doesn't mean anything, really! The remaining new songs, \\"Lazy Afternoon,\\" \\"In the Beginning,\\" \\"Captivated By You,\\" and \\"What You Resist Persists\\" are all strong in their own right with plenty of good music, lyrics, melodies, and guitar work to go around. \\"In the Beginning\\" recalls the convertible-feel of The Eagles' \\"In the City,\\" but a bit more laid back.<br /><br />What about the Nashville additions? Some reviewers have outright rejected them as inappropriate or plain awful. I disagree. Going back to the early days of The Moody Blues with tracks such as \\"It's Up to You\\" through \\"In My World\\" from Long Distance Voyager and \\"All That is Real is You\\" from Strange Times, Hayward has been known to dabble in the country music realm, and with great results in my opinion. This version of \\"It's Cold Outside of Your Heart\\" was originally featured on the second Moody Bluegrass album, which I also enjoyed. Here, the song is stripped down and in your face and it works. \\"What You Resist Persists\\" is a feel-good song performed masterfully. \\"Broken Dream,\\" a favorite of mine from Hayward's \\"View from the Hill,\\" is even better than the original. The stripped down, acoustic direction of the album allows these Nashville tracks to sit comfortably alongside the more pop-oriented songs. Only hardcore detractors of country music can possibly protest.<br /><br />The final three tracks present \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\" from The Moody Blues' Sur La Mer in a club mix. While it's interesting, I didn't find the songs to be anything more than extras.<br /><br />Overall, this album demonstrates what those of us who have been closely following Justin Hayward expected: a confident songwriter, singer and guitarist who continues to evolve and broaden his comfort zone with great results. On this album, he is as relevant and effective as ever, and many of his new songs can stand up to some of his best from the glory days of The Moody Blues. His studio craftsmanship is second to none, and his sense of melody is enviable. Those listeners expecting to hear \\"Nights in White Satin\\" and other Moody Blues classics regurgitated 15 different ways, look elsewhere. This album finds Justin Hayward at the pinnacle of his craft, unpretentious and unafraid; just a musician with his trusty guitar and a story to tell that we can all relate to.yward has been known to dabble in the country music realm, and with great results in my opinion.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|As a fan who has not read the books, I only first heard about them through the show. We are huge fans of period shows so we decided to check out season one and both my husband and I were blown away at the quality in this show. The actors are superb, the scenery and battle seasons are some of the best I've personally seen in Tv shows, and the stories are intriguing. It has been brutal waiting for season 3.
B0079KGAOY|4.0|My husband loves the movies & so when Amazon sent us an email with this we jumped on it. It is a fantastic set at a great price. I had never seen the movies and I was actually surprised when I ended up loving them. The actors of course all phenomenal and do a great job and it was nice to hear some of Mel Gibson's Aussie accent come through in the beginning. There is a lot of action and comedy packed into the movies and the stories are fluid.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great movie that is hard to find.  Movie was shipped very quickly and plays without a hitch and good quality.

B001K3ENEA|5.0|I was hoping for something less expensive than the K240's I have in my studio.  I have three of them and love them but I needed more headphones.  These K-44's sound almost as good and are comfortable.  I bought 3 pair and would buy more.
B00AMGG52O|3.0|This book takes a very long time to say very little. It is the sort that you could read only every 3rd page or so and still not miss anything. Cute I guess for younger readers, but little substance. Writing style is ok. Wouldn't recommend to read
0061673730|1.0|Must be a generational thing. I read this when some one a few decades older than me recommended it. I must say I was wholly disappointed. I'm sure people can get anything out of any advice, but not me. I need depth and substance. There's none here. It's more of a whine-fest. And inquiry? If this counts for inquiry I must have missed something. Stay away, there are better books to read... heck, you might be better off with reality TV.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't hardly put it down. The end caught me off guard. But I think you will enjoy it.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|It's really cute and fun but you need like,50 coins to make each level.... then you only get like,4 or 5 coins each go :/ good but could be better
0375413405|5.0|I love it. I bought one as a gift for my daughter, and kept the other one for myself. Thank you
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read, well written, you are able to get into the minds of the two main characters.<br />At times it will make you laugh and shake your head in disbelief.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|what a complete waste of money. bought for my son. removed every App., Book., and music from device. says it still needs over 600mb space to install. how do I get a refund?
B005OLUOVA|5.0|i can not say how much i have enjoyed this box set. the photo book is wonderful, spanning the bands whole career with many photos i'd never seen before, and the binding is done so as to not cut off any of the 2 page photos, which i was VERY happy to see.<br />i bought this set for the compilation of their videos, and have more than got my moneys worth for them in watch time.<br /><br />my only complaint: the band just (in december2012/january 2013) released a new dvd comp. of their videos, including the 2 Mein Hez Brennt videos and the making of for the &#34;explicit&#34; versoin. i assume this a market ploy, cause that's what marketing teams do.<br /><br />still supremely happy with this purchase! no issues with shipping at all and no damage to the merchandise.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is my 2nd Smith's PP1 sharpener. The folding portion broke off the first one (after at least 2 years of use). It works well and is a good price point.
B00ABT39MG|5.0|so, i had some ordering issues with my initial orders, nothing to do with the vendor at all though, and i was almost going to not order this, but, WOW am i glad i did!<br /><br />amazon shipped it quickly once i finally got things sorted out on my end, and for a huge Rammstein fan, it is wonderful to have both the Piano version of &#34;Mein Herz Brennt&#34; and &#34;Gib Mir Deine Augen&#34; (which i'm actually currently listening to) at my fingertips. the Boys Noize remix is really good and worth having too - the fist week i had the cd in hand, i had it on repeat in my player almost constantly. i recommend it to any and all Rammstein fans, especially those who really enjoy their ballads....<br />1. Mein Herz Brennt [Piano Version]  - Ballad<br />2. Gib Mir Deine Augen  - Really fantastic vocal, very dense sound<br />3. Mein Herz Brennt [Video Edit]<br />4. Mein Herz Brennt [Boys Noize RMX]  - One of the best remixes they've had done, in my opinion<br />5. Mein Herz Brennt [Piano Instrumental]  - Ballad - only the piano line from the piano version, really beautiful<br /><br />over all absolutely FANTASTIC purchase and a really fantastic single!
B008XCM18Q|2.0|I get it!  Bourne fell in the water and is finding himself.  So what???  The plot is hidden under a crush of self-examinating text.  There's only one question: will I finish the book?
B000FA57US|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this movie.  It was very much a continuation of Halloween 4, taking place one year later.  It explained that Jamie (played by Danielle Harris) did not really turn evil, but developed a telepathic bond with Michael.  Because of that she can see when people are in danger from him.  He of course continues to try to get at her in order to kill her.  That part of the movie is fine.  Lets face it, Halloween was never going to be an award winning movie, but if you like the horror genre you are not really looking for that.<br /><br />My problem with this movie is how it set up the dreadful part 6.  It planted the seeds of the whole cult storyline with the mysterious man in black, and began all the nonsense that would follow in that movie.  I don't even have a problem with not killing off Michael, although if it had been done, it would have been a fine way to wrap up the story. They ended up doing a reboot with Halloween H20 a couple movies down the line which really pretended that 4 and 5 never existed anyway, so he could have been killed off here and still made the other.<br /><br />All in all, if you are a fan of the series this is worth having in your collection.  Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasence continued to do a great job in their roles.  Pleasence's role was reduced by now because of his age, but he still played Loomis with passion.  Obviously these movies are not going to appeal to everyone, but if you like the first two movies and the 4th then this one is worth having.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A nice journey through wartime Germany and Europe with the spotlight on the flying corps.  The exchange between the American and the German wasn't the best  of the book but nicely done.  I enjoyed the story.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|What a thriller.  i love it when I read a book and am surprised by the story.  I highly recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this Agamemnon is the best and it fun to play while u wait for something to do or when u table or ride the buz
B00BKTFABE|1.0|This app opens upside down only onmy Kindle Fire HD.  It impossiby difficult to use in that orientation so I deleted it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Seems slow and cumbersome - like a quicker game.  I would give it  &#34;C&#34; works, but not to my taste.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|This is one of the most mind captivating games I have played yet on my Kindle Fire HD 7.0. This is one of a handful of applications I recommend to my friends.<br /><br />D. Weimer<br />Rochester NY

B0027MJU00|5.0|I started with Gone Girl by Flynn.  Could not put it down.  Moved on to Dark Places and it was equally absorbing.  Just could not put down. Awesome!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is so so cool i do wish however there were more words and less amount of coins for colors. still though 5stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love playing before i fall asleep, it lulls me into a trance and i'm out like a light.  i like that it helps when i can't spot the spot.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play it all the time, but when it comes to doing tasks it's a challenge which makes it fun.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|The outpouring of positive feedback for this movie is obviously well deserved.  It is well paced with great sound and picture quality, impeccable direction, a lovely story, and a cast of actors perfectly suited for their roles.<br /><br />Three of the main characters here (Zack, Jeanne, and Cody)are a family living together in a very humble section of San Pedro, CA which is in Los Angeles County. A beautiful, selfless young Gay man, Zack, has put his life on hold to look after his adorable nephew Cody whose mother, played by Tina Holmes, is an irresponsible, self-centered alcoholic with deplorable taste in men.  But his compassion and love are well rewarded when an older gorgeous hunk and surfing buddy, Shaun, reunites with him and eventually becomes his mentor, his \\"rock\\", and his lover as well a wonderful role model and support system for his little nephew.<br /><br />In real life, Trevor Wright(\\"Zack\\") and Brad Rowe(\\"Shaun\\") are both heterosexual and are actually 12 years apart in age. If Brad Pitt makes you drool, so will Brad Rowe, and if you love a perfectly beautiful young man with the face of an angel and a smile that lights up a room like a Christmas tree, you'll love Trevor Wright.  Also, if you like Tina Holmes, I would suggest you check out another great movie, \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" in which she appears as a teen in love with her male \\"BFF\\" who comes out to her as gay.<br /><br />It would be a grave injustice to dismiss this wonderful movie as just another \\"coming out\\" film. It's a tribute to the power of love that can be enjoyed and embraced by all open-minded audiences who appreciate a feel good romance with a happy ending.<br /><br />From my vantage point, having a collection films about love and romance without \\"Shelter\\" would be like having a collection of classic cars without a vintage Pink Cadillac.  Along with \\"Beautiful Thing\\" and Jean-Claude Schlim's \\"House of Boys\\", \\"Shelter\\" is one of the three films that I consider the all time best and most beloved trilogy of gay-themed movies.
0062238868|5.0|Very good book.  It was very insightfull.  Makes me wonder if we really want to win the war.  Political Correctness is killing our country.
B003PDQEBS|4.0|I  purchased this movie not only because it is based on one of the wonderful stories by Christopher Isherwood, but also because it is inconceivable to me that any movie starring Colin Firth and Julianne Moore could be anything less than superb. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Colin Firth plays a Gay college professor who has lost his partner very tragically after a  strong and beautiful 16 year relationship.  His insurmountable grief is captured in the intermittent flashbacks chronicling his relationship.  His agony is exacerbated by the fact he that he only found out about his partner's death because of the kindness of a stranger who felt a moral obligation to call him and apprise him of the tragic event.<br /><br />His lover's family obviously did not recognize or validate their partnership, as he was told that the funeral services are for \\"family only\\".<br /><br />He then plans to commit suicide for lack of any purpose in his life.  But thanks to an endearing friendship with Julianne Moore, and a sweet, beautiful college student who sees his pain, empathizes with him, and forms a special bond with him, the dirty deed is put on hold at least for now.<br /><br />This unselfish and caring young man seems willing to do whatever is necessary to help heal this broken man, even with physical intimacy if things were to go there, but the endearing non-sexual bond they share supersedes any sexual needs they have, so there is no consummation otherwise.<br /><br />When the young man finally spends the night at Firth's home, he sleeps on the couch with Firth's gun next to him.  After finding the gun in a drawer, he wants to ensure that Firth doesn't use it on himself.  Will he be be successful???<br /><br />This is real substance here brought to you by a great filmmaker, Tom Ford.  It's a movie purchase you won't forget or regret.
B003ULUASS|5.0|I love this album cover to death and it looks nicer in LP vinyl format than CD I'm going to even frame it as well. It even has the parental advisory sticker which is gangster.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I prefer reading history, but this is how you do a movie.  Because it can show things you can barely imagine reading... then you see it.  And it's horrific.<br /><br />I've seen the DVD version, and was floored by the quality of the Blu-Ray.  Black and white/contrast is phenomenally good, details and sharpness are top-notch, film grain is excellent, and sound quality is clear, crisp, and distinct - especially with hushed and background tones...  the restoration is truly spectacular.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray, as a 20th anniversary edition, the time and care put into it does make it a must-have.<br /><br />And, obviously, the drama, cinematography, moral of the story, the pain and extortion, the murder of innocent people -- NEVER FORGET.<br /><br />This movie is an absolute masterpiece, in terms of storytelling, acting, writing...  the only sad part is that it's based on real life events...  And life shouldn't have to be so horrific...  why do people treat each other so badly...
0062082353|5.0|super book, still reading it, was so sad to see him get killed at rifle range in Texas.  by<br />someone he was trying to help, so sad!
0679805273|5.0|I love the 2 copies of 'Oh, the places You'll Go' By Dr. Seuss that I bought a week or so ago. I purchased them because I am planning on getting my daughters' teachers to sign the book each year so my girls can remember their days with each teacher. I think it would be a great thing to have when they graduate.. MANY MANY YEARS from now. I like how the books that I bought were hard cover and were in GREAT shape. I also reciived my package the day after I ordered them! I love Dr. Seuss a I couldn't of picked a better book for my project!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have always been a fan of Bejewled but it's not free for Android device.  After searching around I found this game and it was free so I gave it a try and I really like it just as much as Bejewled.  The arcade mode is a bit challenging but it's fun.  I can play it for hours and not even realize hours have passed.  Best game for free.  It could be easily cost $2.99.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|With so many indie authors publishing on Amazon these days, many of the same plot lines seem to repeat themselves.  The problem is compounded when authors try to do too much in a single volume.  Not so here.  Morgan Rice takes care to develop characters and the plot.  That is a refreshing change from all the rest, and that is why this book deserves 5 stars.
0062014536|1.0|This book was far beyond disappointing. I had this release date marked on my calendar for a year, after finishing Delirium and Pandemonium in the matter of a week, and truly believed that the wait would be worth it. It sucks how wrong I was. I am used to Oliver's overly descriptive writing, but in her other books, you are slowly drawn (almost painfully slow) to a fantastic conclusion that makes the time it took to get there worth it. In this book, I kept waiting for that moment to come, but it never did. To me, the Hana perspective was a complete waste of pages and only took away from Lena's story. Alex was a ghost. Julian barely existed. What was the point of Lena's mom being there? Why have all these charecters and not develop them? It felt like the book was written half-heartedly and completely rushed. How can you end a book about revolution in the middle of one battle? It really ruined the series. Such a disappointment!!!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This book was very good. The plot was intriguing and the characters were very well developed. The only somewhat confusing thing in the book was the switch between times. It took me some time to understand that it was going from past events to current events. The violence was sometimes too intense or graphic for my preference but was essential to the intensity of the events occurring at that time. I would read other books by this author.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Had an interesting storyline but it got boring after about 100 pages. Not as riveting as I expected. Try for yourself
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a really cool building game for cities. It's not just like the original Virtual City*,<br />It's like a free play. And lots of goals to complete. I recommend to the ones that are looking forward<br />to a free play app city game that's FREE. Yes... It's free. I hope you enjoy this game!
B008R14YBK|5.0|I bought this for my niece and she loved it. She didn't stop smiling for days. Definitely worth every penny and then some.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its a cool game. i mean im not crazed for it but its occupying and is an ok way to pass by time.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|I chose this product because I have all the ice-age an this added to my collections an 3-D was a good price and there's no way I can get a better price for a better deal with a 3-D movie
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Whether it is true or not it is worth the read. Lots of things to think about. I've read this one twice.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|This box set gets a 5 star review from me. I don't have a High End turntable but these albums played so flawlessly that I was shocked. Absolutely no surface noise at all until I got Magical Mystery Tour and onward. Every album after Magical Mystery Tour had surface noise especially the White Album and Abbey Road. Amazon did a poor job of shipping this heavy item. They shipped it with two air filled plastics on the front of the box and that was all! So when I opened the box, one of the air filled plastic had exploded and there was a huge dent on the side of the box but luckily none of the records were damaged. I ended sending it back and got a replacement within two days! The replacement played with almost no problems at all. Again, the vinyl with surface noise was the White Album. I think this is because the White Album comes with the pictures and poster and maybe that's what's causing the problem but the surface noise was very minimal. And the Book that comes with the Box Set is really amazing quality and great pictures as well. I just wish it was more detailed like how many takes it took per song, etc. But these reproductions of the original releases sound AMAZING. I can't wait to get the Mono Vinyl Box set later on this year. It was really expensive but The Doors are releasing their 6 album Vinyl Box set (and this is their 2nd Vinyl Box Set release by the way) and are charging $400 for that box set! So this Beatles box is a steal. I love it and would recommend it to Vinyl Lovers and Beatles fans.

We have all her books, and some that we've even bought seconds of because we wore out the first copy.  My two boys just LOVE them!  My husband and I have actually memorized most of the books as they are just so cute and we read them every night to our 20 month old.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|this is the first book that had made me cry....it started as a love story fantasy that reminds you of being a teen in love but slaps you with reality of what happens to people and how evil people can be
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The book about Carlos Hathcock was written much better; This was accounts of his entry to the service and not very much detail on each of the shots, just generalized stuff. For example, &#34;we went on roof tops and set up and shot  a few insurgents.&#34;  He amy have the ongest shot, but by his own admittance it was a lucky shot.
0316216453|4.0|Evelyn Waugh achieved an American bestseller when the disillusion of his army years led him to write a lush, sentimental and nostalgic account of a young man's involvement with a very rich, aristocratic Catholic family.  First, at Oxford, Charles Ryder falls in love with the exquisite Lord Sebastian Flyte, who is \\"in love with his childhood\\"--having what we might call a Peter Pan complex, and many years later after Sebastian has descended into full blown alcoholism, with his lovely sister, Julia, who has married against her mother's wishes a coarse-grained, mercenary Canadian. The family's Catholic religion provides a threatening backdrop, but when Julia's apostate father, Lord Marchmain, comes home to die, it comes between Julia and Charles in a final and castastrophic way.<br /><br />Waugh realized later that the book came out of his wartime nostalgia, and apologized for it.  Although an enjoyable read, it is one of those embarassing works of wish-fulfillment where the author allows himself to have all the love and wealth and glamour lived out on the page.  Although Waugh had become a Catholic before the war, he here certainly gives an ambiguous picture of the Catholics in the story.  Most interesting, Lady Marchmain, Sebastian and Julia's mother, widely considered saintly, is hated by both her husband and her son, and inadvertently does her best to drive Sebastian to drink. Rereading the novel again she becomes the center of the book, and very bogus book it is.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|I rented it because friends (female friends) had told me it was a good movie.  The plot was pretty interesting, and of course the eye candy was quite a plus.  What surprised me, however, was that my husband enjoyed the movie.  Of course, he wasn't keen on the dancing scenes but he seemed to get quite into the storyline of the movie.  It's not an Oscar worthy movie, and some of the acting was a bit wooden, but overall it was a fun movie that moved along well.  Definitely a chick flick, which for some reason my husband loves to watch (I don't, go figure), and good for passing the time.  If it showed up on cable I would watch it again, but I would probably not pay to rent or buy it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Not bad I was exited like millions of other players. Let me be honest it only made a second one because of the success of subway surfer. But it's not competing well ( temple run 2 ) don't get me wrong it's fun and addicting. But it's no where close to subway surfer. The reason why subway surfer is successfull is because of its updates. You can't do that with temple run. Temple run was fun for about 4 weeks
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I read of this book but only because I was out of reading material.  It was OK, made for a younger reader.  It was a little to simple; a coming of age story but well written.
B008N1V11U|4.0|I'm not a big fan on movie license games or changed up storyline with the main idea, but somehow this game freckin pulls it off. I don't know how or why it just does. There's just little things that made the game 4 stars instead of 5. Like lags,glitches, Mitch match acting lines . Just those little things can bring a game down
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book brings you through so many differential emotions.  Sure does make me very thankful and how much I love my own spouse!!  Another great book.  Thank you
B000KSJOSG|5.0|I'm not sure what scale this ship is. Apparently, guesstimates on the size of the fictional ship are all over the board so, for me, this little bird is 1:350th.<br />I trimmed the sidewalls down as they are too tall straight out of the package. I reinforced everything with a two-part epoxy, and added tiny details here and there. I added two 1:350th people in the cockpit representing Han and Chewie and modified the ship to hold an LED light so the engines could light up.

B003UESJ9M|4.0|I have to admit that this film was pretty decent. Not my type of flick and I HATE this kind of music (country pop) but I was impressed with some of the performances and the story was pretty decent with great acting all around.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great movie! It is a good movie for both children and adults. My husband and I got a good kick out it, especially if you know any Irish people!
B002ZG97LK|5.0|My teenage girls love this movie.  They are 13 and 16 years old.  I love this movie too.  It's not going to win any awards but the dancing is fun and it is a very good update of the original movie.

B0012QRPU4|5.0|the pilot differs from the rest of the series.  it's mostly plot development for the rest of the series.  awesome, but mostly introductory.  if you have to buy a season, start with 3 or 4.

B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is fun and interesting but the only thing I have fault is, its supposed to be free but when it comes to energy supplies etc so on u have to pay for it which I don't think you should have to use your credit cards to pay they should have some other way of getting doing things like monopoly you have phoney money to buy stuff, they should do something different and also some of the instructions are hard to understand which they don't explain on how to get a key to go to another room. They should explain more in detail, but all in all its a fun game but getting tired cause can't go anywhere with buying which ruines the game!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was excellent and it was so from beginning to end. I really enjoyed the story and really fell in love with the characters. Sky is so strong willed and incredibly likable. Holder, are there really men like him out there? He thinks first and speaks second, that is almost alien. The fact that he always says the most perfect thing is just.... WOW! I wish my daughter were a bit older (she is only 15) because this is such a great book with such a beautiful love story. Holder is the boy (man) that any mother hopes would fall in live, love, like with their daughter. He is just beautiful but in all the ways that really matter. I read Slammed and POR prior to this book and I have to say Hopeless is phenomenal!!
B0095P31L6|5.0|I downloaded this movie for my grandchildren, ages 6 and 3, to watch.  It keep them entertained for the entire movie and they said they loved it.  The 3 year old is autistic so it has to be entertaining to keep him watching it.

1596597682|3.0|I use this idea all the time. People with a fixed or growth mindset react differently to success and failure, to practice and competition and so on.<br />As other reviewers have said the book becomes repetitive after a while. I'd say it could have been half the size and not lost much.<br />The person who read the audiobook was way over-dramatic. I had to stop after a while.
0345803493|3.0|Certain scenes and situations became redundant but was interesting to know how the story continued after reading the first of the series.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The program \\"Suits\\" is brilliantly written and quite nicely produced. I enjoy the Donna Paulson character most. Sarah Rafferty is absolutely gorgeous. I suspect that if Harvey Specter grew up enough to where he could commit himself to one woman, Donna would be the number one person in line, using an axe to beat off numbers two, three, four, five, and six.<br /><br />The Mike/Rachel thing has made me an absolute shipper. I am frustrated waiting until I can find out how they work this out.  We'll see how the producers do it.  It took \\"Bones\\" six full seasons to cross that line.  It took \\"Castle\\" four full seasons. The romance that simply \\"must\\" succeed but somehow \\"can't\\" succeed is the lifeblood of prime time TV.  Allow me to speculate:  Mike and Rachel have had the line crossing in a huge moment of passion.  Half of Rachel will be convinced that it was the worst decision she ever made. She will refuse to be understanding when Mike says \\"Don't tell Harvey I told you!\\"  She will eventually become his ally, but who knows how long that will take?  I hate waiting to find out.
0375703764|4.0|The story is a conundrum wrapped in an enigma inside a puzzle wrapped tightly around a ghost story. This very heavy tome could be dangerous in the right hands. It's a bit roundabout and excessively ornamented, in the writing and in the packaging, but you can tell great care has gone into the building of this edifice.<br /><br />I don't like that the front cover is shortened to reveal the colorful print of the inside cover. It flaps and bends and is inconvenient. The story itself is... pretty amazing.
0062014536|5.0|Obviously people are entitled to like or dislike anything.  But it's important to recognize that, when an artist tries to tear down the walls of formulaic convention by providing a less-than-perfectly-tidy ending, she or he is always going to provoke outrage (think of the firestorm of controversy stirred up by the final episode of THE SOPRANOS).  The fact is that the kinds of issues Lauren Oliver's DELIRIUM trilogy so brilliantly addresses--personal liberty vs. social conformity, the ecstasy and torments of love, the profound struggles of self-discovery--are never easily or unambiguously, let alone fully, resolved in the course of any  individual's life.  To some reader's the ending of REQUIEM might seem a letdown.  To others, it's evidence of her profound literary seriousness of purpose and artistry.  This book is more than escapist fantasy-- it's serious literature.
0393343405|5.0|\\"The Swerve\\" is a magnificent scholarly celebration of Poggio's role in recovering this famous manuscript of Lucretius.<br /><br />There are only two full-scale biographies of Poggio Bracciolini. The only English one is William Shepherd's [[ASIN:B004QOAADI The Life of Poggio Bracciolini]] (1837). [See my own Amazon review.] It shows its age. Some of the language can strike us as quaint. Many turns of phrase seem too long in coming to the point and flowery, in the 19th-century rhetorical style. On another hand, some formulations are sharp and strikingly concise. Long quotations in Latin (in the notes at the bottom of pages) are shown without translation. The lack of an initial table of contents and the lack of any kind of index are particularly irksome. In addition there are some errors in the text. For instance, Pope John XXIII is mislabeled XXII, following the renumbering of Gibbon, (as John XXI skipped the XX numbering, there had been no Pope John XX).<br /><br />It is helpful to check details and dates against the superior biography by the German scholar Ernst Walser, [[ASIN:1246190141 Poggius Florentinus, Leben Und Werke]] (German Edition, Berlin, 1914; Reprints: Georg Olms,1974; Nabu Press, 2011), which remains by far the most complete biography to-date, with more recent, accurate, and detailed information than William Shepherd's, but unfortunately not translated into English.<br /><br />Poggio was marked by the passion of his teachers for books and writing, inspired by the first generation of Italian humanists centered around Francesco Petrarch (1304-1374), who had revived interest in the forgotten masterpieces of Livy and Cicero, Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375) and Coluccio Salutati (1331-1406).<br />Poggio joined the second generation of civic humanists forming around Salutati. Resolute in glorifying \\"studia humanitatis\\" (the study of \\"humanities\\", a phrase popularized by Leonardo Bruni), learning (studium), literacy (eloquentia), and erudition (eruditio) asthe chief concern of man, Poggio ridiculed the folly of popes and princes, who spent their time in wars and ecclesiastical disputes instead of reviving the lost learning of antiquity.<br />[See Anthony Grafton, [[ASIN:0472106260 Commerce with the Classics: Ancient Books and Renaissance Readers]], (Un. of Michigan Press, 1997).]<br /><br />The literary passions of the learned Italians in the new Humanist Movement, which were to influence the future course of both Renaissance and Reformation, were epitomized in the activities and pursuits of this self-made man, who rose from the lowly position of scribe in the Roman Curia to the privileged role of apostolic secretary.  He became devoted to the revival of classical studies amid conflicts of popes and antipopes, cardinals and councils, in all of which he played an official part as first-row witness, chronicler and (often unsolicited) critic and adviser.<br /><br />After John XXIII had been elected pope (later labeled antipope) by the dissident Council of Pisa (May 1410), he was deposed by the Council of Constance in May 1415, while Gregory XII abdicated in July 1415, as agreed with the Council to clear the way to a restoration of a unified papacy.<br /><br />Poggio's duties had called him to the Council of Constance in 1414, following John XXIII. After John XXIII's termination, the papal office in Italy remained vacant for two years, which gave Poggio some forced leisure time in 1416-17.<br /><br />He indulged in some welcome relaxation from the papal court environment.<br /> In the spring of 1416 (sometime between March and May), Poggio visited the baths at the German spa of Baden. In a long letter to Nicolli, he reported his discovery of a \\"Epicurean\\" lifestyle -- one year before finding Lucretius -- where men and women bathe together, barely separated, in minimum clothing: \\"I have related enough to give you an idea what a numerous school of Epicureans is established in Baden. I think this must be the place wherethe first man was created, which the Hebrews call the garden of pleasure. If pleasure can make a man happy, this place is certainly possessed of every requisite for the promotion of felicity.\\"<br /><br /> Poggio also persevered in his pursuit of manuscript hunting, exploring the libraries of Swiss and Swabian abbeys. His great manuscript finds date to this period, 1415-1417. The treasures he brought to light at Reichenau, Weingarten, and above all St. Gall, retrieved from the dust and abandon many lost masterpieces of Latin literature, and supplied scholars and students with the texts of authors whose works had hitherto been accessible only in fragmented or mutilated copies.<br /><br />One of Poggio's finds that has become especially famous was, in January 1417, in a German monastery (never named by Poggio, but probably Fulda), the discovery of the only manuscript of Lucretius's \\"De Rerum Natura\\" known at the time. Poggio spotted the name, which he remembered as quoted by Cicero.<br /><br />This was a Latin poem of 7,400 lines, divided into six books, giving a full description of the world as viewed by the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. It has been translated as \\"On the Nature of the Universe\\" (Oxford World's Classics).<br /><br />The manuscript found by Poggio was not even preserved, but he sent the copy he had ordered to Niccolo Niccoli, who made a transcription in his beautiful book hand (the creator of italic script), which became the model for the more than fifty other copies circulating at the time. Poggio complained that Niccoli didn't return his original copy for 14 years! Later two 9th-century manuscripts were discovered, the O (\\"Oblongus\\", ca. 825) and Q (\\"Quadratus\\") codices, now kept at Leiden University. The book was first printed in 1473.<br /><br />This miraculous discovery is the subject of Greenblatt's magnificent book \\"The Swerve: How the World Became Modern\\" (Sept. 2011). The book details the sensational discovery of the old Lucretius manuscript by Poggio. It describes the strange materialistic Epicurean physics based on the atomism of Democritus -- the world is made only of atoms (irreducible, indestructible, non-divisibles), \\"the seeds of things\\", forming objects through the random collision due to the clinamen, the \\"swerve\\" -- and its ethics. Greenblatt analyzes the poem's subsequent impact on the development of the Renaissance, the Reformation and modern science.<br /><br />The book won the 2011 National Book Award for Non-fiction, and the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. It was well received by the public, although many critics contended that Greenblatt's enthusiasm sounded hyperbolic, and doubted that the Lucretius manuscript had any immediate influence on the development of the European Weltanschauung.<br />[See for instance David Quint's review, \\"Humanism as Revolution\\", (The New Republic, Sept. 28, 2011), and Anthony Grafton's \\"The Most Charming Pagan\\", (The New York Review of Books, Dec. 8, 2011)]<br /><br />Anthony Grafton remarked: The discovery can be seen as a miracle, since monks, \\"athletes of holiness\\" lived the opposite of Epicurus's model life. \\"The monasteries, in Greenblatt's account--a curious blend of 'Gibbonian irony and Sadean relish' --were not quiet, dignified centers for the performance of the liturgy and the copying of texts but 'theaters of pain.' Their inmates vied to torment themselves more effectively than their rivals, wielding everything from whips and chains to iron crosses fixed with nails into their bodies. In these houses of self-punishment, classical texts naturally aroused relatively little interest, and pleas for the pursuit of pleasure were stigmatized as especially evil. Only a swerve or two--the fact that a copy survived in a library that Poggio happened to explore--saved 'On the Nature of Things' from the extinction suffered by most of Epicurus' own works.\\" However, concludes Grafton, \\"We never quite learn, in the end, how the world became modern...[But Greenblatt] has brought Lucretius a good many new readers, to judge from the fact that A.E. Stallings's wonderful Penguin translation of the poem is now Amazon's best-selling title under Poetry.\\"<br /><br />This discovery was enhanced by the translation from Greek into Latin of \\"The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers by Diogenes Laertius\\" (ca. 1430), including three full letters by Epicurus. This convergence introduced the philosophy of Epicurus to the mindset of the Italian humanists, and was noted essentially by philosophers and literary circles for its views on ethics and religion (understood in its original sense as the binding down power of beliefs) -- its proclaimed indifference of gods to human affairs, who didn't create the world either; its condemnation of superstitions; its ridiculing of the fear of death since the soul dies with the body; its dispelling the notion of founding morality on an illusory afterlife and its imagined terrors -- and its advocation of the pursuit of beauty and pleasure (happiness) and the avoidance of pain. In fact, the new philosophy was seen as liberating thinking from the Christian worldview of asceticism and preoccupation with angels and demons, and indulging the pleasure of knowledge, the natural curiosity for the workings of the real world and history.<br />[See the fundamental article by David Sedley, \\"Lucretius\\", (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, SEP, Aug. 2008) and Ronald G. Witt, [[ASIN:0521764742 The Two Latin Cultures and the Foundation of Renaissance Humanism in Medieval Italy]] (Cambridge Un. Press, March 2012)]<br /><br /> Additional support came from a dialogue by Lorenzo Valla, \\"De Voluptate\\" (\\"On Pleasure\\", 1431) revised as \\"De Vero Bono\\" (\\"On the True Good\\", 1433), where Valla construed Epicurean \\"pleasure\\" as a component of Christian charity and beatitude, rejecting the classical association with Stoic virtue.<br />[See the excellent article by Lodi Nauta, \\"Lorenzo Valla\\", (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, SEP, 2009)]<br /><br />The recovery of Lucretius's iconoclastic poem had to face the hostility of the Catholic Church. Jerome had already \\"reported\\" that Lucretius had died in madness from a \\"love philter\\". \\"The poet Titus Lucretius was born. Later he was turned mad by a love potion, but in the intervals in between the madness he composed some books, which Cicero afterwards edited. He killed himself when he was 44 years old.\\" In Chronological Tables, (ed. A. Schoene, 171st Olympiad 96-93 BC, 171.3).<br />Epicurus's philosophy was labeled as \\"atheism\\" by the Catholic Church, which tried to suppress Lucretius's book.<br /><br />After teaching Epicurean philosophy was banned in Florence in 1513, Machiavelli (1469-1527) made his own copy by hand, and 16th-century scholars used Lucretius covertly, his book fuelling an underground counterculture opposed to the medieval ideas of the \\"gothic\\" Dark Age. This was the key period of Italian humanists launching the recovery of reason and liberation from faith and superstition through reconnecting with the Greco-Roman texts, as well described by John Addington Symonds in [[ASIN:B00ANWZ2T4 Renaissance in Italy, Volume 2]] (7 vol., 1875-86), Voltaire and David Hume. Thomas More made the pursuit of pleasure the focal point of his [[ASIN:039393246X Utopia]] (1516). Lucretius was repeatedly quoted by Montaigne in his [[ASIN:B009M0V1OI Essays]] (1580).<br />[See Alison Brown, [[ASIN:0674050320 The Return of Lucretius to Renaissance Florence (I Tatti Studies in Italian Renaissance History)]]. (Harvard Un. Press, 2010)<br />And Frederick Krantz, \\"Between Bruni and Machiavelli: History, Law, and Historicism in Poggio Bracciolini\\", in [[ASIN:0521527023 Politics and Culture in Early Modern Europe: Essays in Honour of H. G. Koenigsberger]] (Cambridge Un. Press, 1987), p. 119-152.]<br /><br />This heralded the dramatic change of world focus that Greenblatt calls \\"the swerve\\" in Western civilization.  Greenblatt quotesone of Epicurus's disciples: Living with pleasure is impossible \\"without living prudently and honorably and justly, and also without living courageously and temperately and magnanimously, and without making friends, and without being philanthropic.\\"<br />This basic philosophy of pleasure and the need for friends, (later termed \\"pursuit of happiness\\"), was the key to Epicurus.<br /><br />It was grotesquely caricatured by Christian critics as unrestricted sensual indulgence. Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), burnt at the stake as a \\"heretic\\" by the Inquisition (1600) had incorporated some of Lucretius's ideas into his own cosmology and pantheism.<br />[See Riccardo Fubini, [[ASIN:0822330024 Humanism and Secularization: From Petrarch to Valla]], (transl. Martha King, Duke Un. Press, 2003).]<br /><br />Fuller recognition of Lucretius's physics -- its theory of atoms and the \\"swerve\\" -- by modern physicists did not happen until at least the 17th century with the atomism of Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655), while Isaac Newton (1642-1727) also declared his support for atomism.<br />Lucretius's modern-sounding views on evolution (of geology, nature, and primitive human society) were not acknowledged by scientists until the 18th century, when Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802), Charles's grandfather, announced ideas of evolution in his poems \\"The Loves of the Plants\\" (1789) and \\"The Temple of Nature\\" (1803) . Thomas Jefferson owned eight editions of De Natura Rerum.<br />[See, Gordon Lindsay Campbell, \\"Lucretius on Creation & Evolution\\", (Oxford Un. Press, 2003)]<br /><br />Whoever has read Lucretius cannot forget his description of the three methods of primitive man's love-making: woman's own desire, man's brutal force, or seduction with \\"pira lecta\\" (choice pears).<br /><br />\\"Et Venus in silvis jungebat corpora amantum;<br />conciliabat enim vel mutua quamque cupido<br />vel violenta viri atque inpensa libido<br />ver pretium, glandes atque arbita vel pira lecta.<br />(Book V, 962-965)<br /><br />And Venus used to join the bodies of lovers;<br />for either common desire attracted each woman<br />or the violent force of a man and his excessive lust<br />or a bribe, acorns and arbute-berries or choice pears.<br /><br />[See Robert D. Brown, \\"Lucretius on Love and Sex\\", (Brill, 1987), in the series \\"Columbia Un. Studies in the Classical Tradition\\"]. The whole world of courtship in New York City remains driven by the sophisticated use of \\"pira lecta\\".<br /><br /> Ancient Greek materialist physics was the subject of Karl Marx's Ph.D. thesis. Karl Marx started working on the materialism and atheism of the Greek atomists under the guidance of Bruno Bauer at Bonn University. Marx presented his thesis, \\"The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature\\" to the more liberal Un. of Jena, which granted him his Ph.D. in April 1841. When Bauer was expelled, on express order of the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm IV, from his position as lecturer in theology in the spring of 1842 for his revolutionary ideas on the New Testament writings, Marx abandoned any hopes for an academic career.<br />Both Harvard philosopher George Santayana and French philosopher Henri Bergson were strongly influenced by Lucretius's ideas of evolution and ethics.<br /><br />Greenblatt has paid an outstanding homage to Lucretius and Poggio Bracciolini, two great figures of the Western World's emancipation from the Middle Ages' obscurantist Christian worldview into a modern vision of humanism -- based on the retrieval of Greco-Roman texts, literacy, education, experimental knowledge, and centered on human aspirations -- bringing our horizon back from the celestial heaven of angels and demons down to earth, and the reality of what the ancient Greeks called polis, nature and our cosmos.
0385536828|5.0|Yes, this is a kind of spy novel, set in a dreary Britain of coal miner strikes and power shortages, circa 1972. The only place that’s  warm is bed. And that’s where the “spy,” a young woman Cambridge graduate named Serena Frume, ends up, quite happily, when she falls in love with the subject of her first assignment for MI5.<br /><br />However, this is also a novel about writing, about literary taste, and about the shifty line between reality and imagination.  Serena and her lover, the writer T.H. Haley, both love books, but they have entirely different tastes. She prefers the “real” and falls in love with a mental image of Haley before she has even met him, simply by conjuring him up from the characters in his short stories. He, in turn, tries to interest her in poetry and in more avant garde fiction. Many reviewers have pointed out that Haley seems to resemble, in some respects, the young Ian McEwen. A reader will realize pretty quickly that McEwen is going to have fun with Serena’s disdain for what she calls “literary tricks”<br /><br />There is also some interesting writing in Sweet Tooth on the extent to which governments enlist the arts, either covertly or directly, to buttress political arguments.<br /><br />A reader interested in the spy novel aspects of Sweet Tooth might do well to beat a retreat back to Le Carr&eacute;.  McEwen’s novel is for the bookish, readers who enjoy thinking about the kind of espionage involved in creating novels.<br /><br />M. Feldman
B004PHE9F6|5.0|This is a great racing movie, not to be equaled.  The transfer of the 70mm film to bluray is fantastic.  The audio is listed as 5.1, but since the movie was made in 1966, prior to the modern audio standards, it is only so-so.  That said, you still hear those V12 engines roar from one side of the screen to another.  The colors and exposure are perfect, a standard  not seen since Patton (DVD verison,  not bluray).  Well worth the money.

B0076XIS4O|5.0|Listening to Claire Boucher, I get a clear feeling of her playing with music like a child plays with everything around her, a child's hypnotic dream.  She mixes forms of industrial, electronic, pop, hip hop, noise, rock, classical...  This mishmash music is easily grasped by the listener through rythmic and melodic repetion, giving it form and structure amongst it's heavy layers.  Claire Boucher's music comes close to how thoughts run through my head, making it familiar and intimate.  I recommend sampling Oblivion, Genesis, and Nightmusic as a starting point.

B007X4ECLY|3.0|It's no &#34;Laurence of Arabia', but it is decent brain-check entertainment.  Guy Pearce is sufficiently witty, and the action is not bad.  A decent evening of entertainment at the right price.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Works fine.  I am not a big twitter user but like to track family and close friends.  No I am not a stalker.
B004UFEJW6|5.0|Starts with excellent violence, builds a tear-jerking story about an unappreciated soldier, and ends with excellent violence.  This is a great balance between chick-flick and guy-movie.  Try this one on date-night.
B009KHCT94|4.0|I loved this movie, it was so campy I had to enjoy it! It was also hilarious, if you like 1950's B-movies, add this to your list of must see.
B009RH973I|3.0|This was ok but I wasn't expecting a plastic cover.  Went to an electronics store and bought a new leather one for the same price.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|I love Jane Austen. she is so good at capturing the emotions of relationships that we can all relate to. Persuasion was definitely one of my favorites.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Sherlock Holmes makes you think while you read. A classic I enjoyed reading. Definitely a great free book to have on hand when you are stuck  on the train and can't download a new book.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I like this game better than Bejeweled. It is a lot of fun and keeps my child entertained for hours.
B004WO57E4|5.0|The complete collection of HM&M put me in the &#34;way back&#34; machine for hours of fun.  I would recommend for those who like these types of computer games.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|nice clock wish my kindle fire was louder.  also wish it had a way to override the kindle's volume so if I fall asleep listening to I heart radio the alarm will still go a full volume.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game!<br />Very good graphic, good gameplay.<br />More tournaments would be nice!<br />Great for horse lovers and Kids.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|Please be warned- my review mentions SPOILERS so read at your own caution.<br /><br />The truth is, the Exorcist disturbs me on several unexplainable levels.  You know how sometimes the moment you fall asleep, you have nightmares that result in your heart pounding and jumping awake for about an hour?  These type of nightmares usually occur minutes after falling asleep, though not always.  Sometimes they occur in the middle of the night.  A few segments in this version of the Exorcist are comparable to these kind of nightmares.<br /><br />The most disturbing thing I have honestly EVER seen is when the little girl of Linda Blair walks down the stairs BACKWARDS like a spider while the mother is already traumatized over another incident and crying at the bottom of the stairs, only to look up and see her daughter literally spider-walking down the steps and throwing up blood when she reaches the bottom.  For some bizarre reason, people on other parts of the internet think this scene is hilarious but for me, it's 100% a totally different positively *frightening* reaction.  I guess I'm alone.<br /><br />Also, several other segments are equally disturbing.  Think about it- the year is 1973, this movie is released, and we're seeing a little girl possessed by the devil and stabbing herself in the you-know-what with a cross, screaming the worst cuss words you can think of, blood squirting everywhere, the mother screaming for her daughter to stop and praying to God for this madness to end, only for it to gradually intensify to the point the girl is no longer what she originally was and the devil has completely taken over her body.  INSANE!<br /><br />Then... that's not all!  Priests have to be completely convinced that the girl is actually in need of an exorcism when the mother simply can't take her daughters deteriorating condition anymore, and a rather lengthy (and from a storyline point of view, EXTREMELY well-done) amount of time and attempts to remove the evil from the girls body take place, and let me tell you something- this particular segment may be over 20 minutes long, but it's the most heart-pounding and captivating 20 minutes I've ever felt in a horror movie and makes it difficult for other movies to surpass.  Not just hard- maybe even impossible.  Not only do people remember the Exorcist for how ahead of its time the violent and disturbing images are, but it may also be remembered for being so darn effectively scary that a better movie hasn't been made yet.<br /><br />Also, the ominous piano intro from Mike Oldfield's now famous Tubular Bells album can be heard a couple times in the movie, and I can't stress this enough- the ENTIRE 48-minute album is incredible and one of the most creative and adventurous you will ever hear, so I highly recommend buying it (along with this Exorcist: Director's Cut movie of course).<br /><br />I guess if I have one complaint about the Exorcist it's that there's some uninteresting downtime taking place on a few occasions when the daughter isn't shown on TV, and I suppose these scenes may drag if you're in a somewhat impatient mood.  You know, a mood when you just want to get to the scares and skip the rest.  Then again, you can simply counter this by waiting until you're in an open-minded mood.  Still, the Exorcist is easily a 5-star picture perfect horror classic.  PLEASE watch it.  For 1973, it's well ahead of its time and I can only imagine how controversial this movie was back then because it's incredibly graphic even to this day.  I was even turning my head away during a few scenes.  It just becomes too much to bare sometimes... and it's awesome.  That's how a good horror movie is supposed to be.
B0015DROBO|5.0|All around great. Mystery, sex, adventure and a great plot. Can't wait to read the book 2 in the Trilogy.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|My least favorite book by Gillian Flynn. Too predictable and the characters were ofver done. Not as well written as Gone Girl.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|What's to say. Great writing great acting. Loved every minute of it. If you like sci-fi this one is for you.
1451626657|5.0|Ignore any bad reviews on this book. This book is the peak of Heller's strength and ability.<br />The book is hilarious and had me rolling in fits of laughter at many times. It is also a very good depiction of bureaucracy & government in action. It is a very good depiction of our current government and the direction it is pursuing.<br />In order to not like this book you would have to: A) not read it. B) not be able to read C) be exceedingly naive or ignorant or D)hate all literature.<br />Catch-22 has a moderately substantial length for a novel, not war & peace length or anything Dostoevskian.<br />The short summary is that this is the plight of Yossarian, a man who would rather be done with military service and be living a domestic life. However the government continuously increases the service requirements to retire and simultaneously imposes impossible rules. Rules that prevent you from obeying other rules.<br />The story outlines how government interference perverts people and enterprises that are otherwise well meaning and destined to succeed such as illustrated by Milo Minderbinder.<br />Even if this book was assigned to you for a class, with hold judgement. I understand how being assigned to read anything can ruin it for you. But this book is a pure joy from beginning to end. You will not want to put it down.<br />If you have not read this book, buy, borrow it, and read it. You will not regret it.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Great show. Enjoyed seeing these talented actors in this movie again! I would recommend this movie to others who enjoy oldies but goldies.
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|If you like Thomas Newman then you'll love this soundtrack. He has so many great soundtracks, this is a must have!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not what I expected at all... she's kinda whiny in my opinion... also he's just a jerk with money. Meh.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The acting is perfect. The setting authentic and the human life lessons are pretty universal. It consider it a teaching movie that shows how much a good life is about what you believe and how it affects what you perceive.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Soulful. Reminded me why I've always believed Jimi to be a musical genius. Not only is his guitar playing outstanding, but the horns and bass in some of the songs is groovy!<br />Thanks to the trust and to Eddie Kramer and all others involved in putting this out. Thank you--this is timeless and a national treasure.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I really love the look,the color and the feel of this case  The only problem i have is that i have to take the case off my phone when i want to charge it  my charger will not fit into slot  which wouldnt be that bad BUT once the case is on its kinf of hard to get back off but other thab\n that is great
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|This game was &#34;stuck&#34; and unable to be entered for a couple of days after being established and when I was able to get back in, it started from the beginning all over again. I lost animals, decorations and money/tokens. GameLoft not a company that has good customer service as they have not responded on this game and also on Fantasy Town which is another GameLoft game of which THE SAME THING HAPPENED!
B009ZQGNPQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this season, and found it more compelling than Season 2. There are some beautiful, heartbreaking story threads. Of course, the final moments leave a lot to be desired... It will be interesting to see how those are addressed up ahead. But overall a charming and transporting season.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|Without having to buy jewels. Very little pirates are available to buy with coins- the game does not have a large variety of items you can purchase with coins earned during play. Makes you almost have to buy jewels to be able to get the nicer items.  Also the bad pirates come every 3 minutes...not enough time to be able to do other play on the island without always having to go back to fight the bad pirates every 3 minutes.
1402786360|5.0|After purchasing Mrs. Bairds cookbook and looking through her beautiful and creative pastries I had to display this book in my kitchen. I love how she constantly surprises me on each page with her creativness. If you are looking for something new and different in the bakery world..this book is for you.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My husband and I watched this before our daughter even got to.  We were glued to the tv the whole time.  Each movie teaches children a lesson.  Children of all ages even adults learn something from the movies.  We laughed we cried it was just great
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I really love it! It is adorable, fun, and it always makes my day! And whenever I see rainbow dash on the icon, I always say....\\"WOOOOHHHOOOOOO!!!!\\"
B004J4WNL2|4.0|All said, this was a really well written book about an oft discussed but equally misunderstood topic and group of people. I'm probably making some sweeping generalizations here, but my guess is that many who will read/have read this book are introverts. And, while I'd classify myself as an introvert who gained much from this book, I think many extroverts would benefit even more, yet will probably pass this book over. I hope I'm wrong...we could all stand to learn a little more about one another. Susan has done a good job of highlighting that, if nothing else, in Quiet.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I found only one issue with this game, at times you get stuck and need help but the help is very, very poor....
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I got the feeling about halfway through about who the killer was in this story. I would have appreciated a little more subtlety about this person's character and wish the author had done a better job of misleading the reader to keep some of the mystery before the big reveal. Additionally, many of the characters in this story were unlikeable and cold with little personality. It was difficult to care about the characters, including the families of the victims.
0525478817|5.0|This book is John Green's best book so far. Make sure you have tissues around, because you'll need them. It's such a good story.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|what a fun game, it is a good way to enjoy a friendly game with friends.  The tournement options are also great.
B008Q7O6VS|4.0|It was a really great idea to release a commemorative 20th anniversary version of Megadeth's Countdown To Extinction. The good aspects are the remastered disc, which sounds great (even not being remixed as the 2004's Remixed And Remastered version) because we have the original sound of that record improved without changing its structure. Another good thing is to have a bonus live CD with the entire Cow Palace 1992 concert on it, which is a good deal.<br /><br />Flaws? Yes, that product have some:<br /><br />-  I know that live concert is a bit longer; I mean, they put all the songs on the CD, but edited some of the Mustaine's speaking during songs to fit in just one CD, instead of two. It could be better to keep it like the original, it would definetly sound more natural, for it's own good.<br /><br />- Also about the live record: I don't understand why Mustaine agreed to remix (again...) this live audio with Johnny K, since that concert (or maybe just part of that concert, I really don't know for sure) was (re)mixed by Andy Sneap (just check some live songs of the 2007's box set Warchest, and/or the 2008 compliation Anthology: Set The World Afire to check what I'm saying), and it was perfect in that way. I don't really think, based on that, that we got an \\"improved sound\\" thanks to that Mustaine's option considering that this 2007's Andy Sneap remix was already perfect and indeed much better than that one made by Johnny K.<br /><br /> - A bonus DVD with some rare footage would be nice.<br /><br />- The booklet could be more complete, and/or with more text/info/photos.<br /><br />- No bonus tracks on disc 1. I mean, in the original japanese version they added the songs Breakpoint and Go To Hell, and even in the Remixed & Remastered version from 2004 we got the complete version of Crown of Worms as bonus, as well as some demo versions of some songs of the album. To think that there's a plenty of B-sides of that era unreleased til now...<br /><br />I know that this version of Countdown To Extincton pales completely in comparison with the 25th Anniversary Edition of Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?, released in 2011. But that's a 20th anniversary edition, not 25th. And who knows what they will add when they re-released it again in 2017, as a 25th Anniversary Edition (do you REALLY think they will not do that in 2017?)?<br /><br /> Anyway, it is a good addition, but it really could be more complete.
1577314808|5.0|My mother read this and I could see a change in her life.  Peace is the best way to describe the outcome.  Living for today... the now is truely the way God intended for us to live and love.  Highly recommend this book.
B008BO61BE|4.0|Good bonus tracks, as well as the bonus DVD. But I think they should made this one a little improved, like another disc (a bonus CD in that case, with some live and/or rare/previously unreleased/demo/outtake material) with a complete concert, for example. Besides, strangely they didn't put the lyrics of the songs on the booklet of this edition. Maybe because of Google (where you can search for all Judas Priest lyrics) the recordlabel has tapped to \\"wisely\\" save space in the booklet? Who knows?<br /><br />But anyway, it's a good edition for collectors  but, as I said before, not near as good and/or complete as the British Steel 30th Anniversary Edition.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is on my kindle.  I've enjoyed this if I want to take a break from any reading... but I have to admit that until I win a game I can't put it down.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great to watch Son's in HD! Even better when you purchase the HDMI cable from Amazon and connect to your flat screen TV.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is on my kindle mostly for my kids but I have to admit...I have tried it out.  Warning, after a workout like that you may need to eat a piece of fruit (:
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love the graphics and the surrounding. Its a little tricky to get used to steering but you'll get the hang of it quick. Cool game so far.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My boys love it, we play it a lot when we are in the car and at home, the best
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This Magical Journey has changed my life into an Amazing Life. It has been a year since i first went through Tve Magic and i have accomplished more beautiful goals than in the past 10 years. Gratitud, love and Faith.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 3 boys get a kick out of the game, they can't stop playing when asked to, but I'm glad they like it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|<3 these books. Definitely a great read. May not be for everyone but was definitely for me. Love it. Great!
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Cute story. It was too short however, I would have liked some more interaction between the heroine and her lover.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it. Not as descriptive as some of her other books, but wonderful characters. Unpredictable. Wished I'd read it when I was younger and could have truly enjoyed the youthful romance.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great read with lots of unexpected twists. I can't wait to read more. The story line was great and kept me wanting more.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is alright but they need to let you earn for titles then one at a time hope they keep making games like this.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This version includes a little extra footage that makes the story even better than the theatrical version.  There are also lots of bonuses about the original graphic novel and making the film.  Well worth the money!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This is vintage DeMille - except it just wasn't quite on a par with Plum Island, General's Daughter, or others by this author.  It was, however, good enough. Especially if you're a dedicated DeMille fan - like me - it was definitely worth reading.  Now, unfortunately, I have to sit and await the next one.
B00AFEY354|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! I highly recommend this for everyone to watch. Great cast and 5 stars all the way.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Gary, Georgia and Kenny bring more than a breath of fresh air to Country Music, they bring a level of sophistication that fully realizes the genre. Writing and vocal arrangements are transcendent, but the unique blend of their voices brings it all home. Loved &#34;Finally Home&#34; and look forward to more!<br />Patrick Breed
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were a ma amazing and it is sad there are no more to read. The books are a must read.
B000ICM5IK|4.0|You will get most of the main titles from the Rocky series and I found that enjoyable.  The one song missing that I think should have been included is &#34;The Measure of a Man&#34;.  I like the song.  Just my opinion.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|2 stars Good story. A like a good romance where the hero wins! Not too raunchy! Fantasy, it was never going to be real.
B00003CXA6|4.0|I thought this was a great depiction of the battle.  If you know anything about the battle and the field commanders you will find this a very good historical history of the actual event.  Many things were left out but with an event this hugh it would be impossible to cover everything.  Overall,  I think it was very well done.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I like the game it works great and also it is very fun i like it better than minecraft itself. I am going to buy the full version of the game.
159562015X|5.0|Love using this book when I get a new team of people together - its a quick way of looking at people and teams. Wish I discovered this book when I was younger as I would have been a lot more careful of potential career paths. Love it!! Development should be all about understanding and playing to your strengths.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|So ridiculously bad we couldn't make it past 30 minutes.  The hand of the director everywhere blocking the action, characters, everything.  I didn't realize I'd queued up Moulins Rouge.  Awful.  Wish I could ask for my money back.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|I REALLY HATE the fact that when you run out of lives you have to PAY FOR THEM.. NOT FAIR. NOT RIGHT. The game is suppose to be FREE!!! They grab you with FREE then snag you with PRICES!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I am not changing my password every 30 days for an app. Then theycwant very intrusive permission which have no bearing on the functionality of the app. Delete!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome... Awesome book. Couldn't put it down, really I couldn't. I basked like a baby at the end. I have already downloaded book 2, which I will open as soon as I finish this review.
B0098G7AWS|3.0|EVeryone has seen this movie. Rerented it with my daughter who had never seen it. She was learnign about the Titanic in school so it was a good time to rewatch
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|angry birds with a nice twist! I love star wars and i love angry birds and now I can love both of them at the same time.
1936891026|1.0|I was beyond excited to read this book. Being an all day everyday creative in my job sometimes I have a hard time being motivated to create for myself. This book promised insight into motivation and creative process... It actually gave me hives and festered a sense of rage towards the author.<br /><br />His anecdotes and metaphors were poorly structured and added little to no addition to his original thought. It reads as though there was no editing process, as if it went straight from his computer to press. It was so difficult to stay with his train of thought; His tangents often lead to dead ends and awkward correlations.<br /><br />The book can be summed up in three words: Stop Being Lazy. That's it.<br />Do not waste your time or money. There are SO many other books out there that are more deserving of the title War of Art. This book will not help you through your blocks and inner creative battles.<br /><br />And to use his own term: The reading of this book was a practice in resistance all on its own.<br /><br />Good luck to you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is such a great series! I love it so so so much. The characters are so real. The drama is great and really gets you hooked. My husband and I enjoy watching this series together.

B000YAA68C|4.0|My daughter wanted this for a gift. She said she loved it. I have seen it before and I love the movie, too.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Excellent game-jogs the eye and mind coordination. I particular like playing against the clock. I do not repeat the same game in less than a week but am still improving my times.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Cool animation when battery is charging.  Sits happily in the background and doesn't seem to interfere with any apps. Would be even better if the colours could be customised.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a great creative game and I enjoy every minute of this game. I love this game, especially when I do competition.

0142418471|4.0|For some reason Will Grayson has been the John Green book I've thought I'd enjoy the most (not counting TFioS, obviously) since I started hearing about him and his books. When I began reading Will I was a little disappointed. It was all fine and good and all, but it felt a lot like his other books: depressed guy who likes girls but isn't girl crazy, funny/interesting guy friend, girl interest who is a little depressed/confused/etc. But then things got awesome. Of course, it's mostly due to the combination of John and David's writing and the way the whole crazy, awesome story came together, but it was also a little something else.<br /><br />I don't particularly want to pick the book apart as I loved it all as a whole. I mean, there were plenty of small things I could talk about and analyze, but just know that it is completely, freaking, awesome. If for no other reason, read it for Tiny Cooper and his fantastically gay musical.
B007REV4YI|5.0|In my opinion this is a great product the best bond ever or close to it and I have the complete collection.
0812993292|5.0|A beautifully written book, and quite unlike anything I've read in a very long time.  Harold's quiet determination in the face of overwhelming odds is incredibly inspiring, and his encounters with different individuals have a wonderfully \\"real\\" flavor to them.  Joyce pens a wonderful tale, and I can already tell it will resonate with me for years to come.  I recommend it to everyone.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|Use it all the time to create the most fantastic salads and meals. Our vegetarian friends are most impressed, too! The flavours are delicious.
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|This is a lovely game, the graphics are beautiful, the music is pleasant but won't make you fall asleep. There are little extras like find coins to earn trophies and put a snowman back together to receive an important item you will need, there are also some items you have to find on your own. The puzzles are challenging but not so difficult that you have a hard time solving them which is great for me because the puzzles in other HOG`s have always given me trouble. The game runs very smoothly in my kindle fire and I've had no trouble with freezing. The story line us still mysterious but not so dark as others. I enjoy how you meet different characters throughout and they help you on your quest. The developers here have given you just enough of a change from other hogs to make it new while sticking to the traditional way hogs have been made. I give 4 stars only because during a scene it is easy to accidentally hit the hint or back button. Since you get achievements in this game for not using hints they should have gone about placing those buttons differently. It's not such a terrible thing really you just have to be a little more careful where you touch. I think this is an extremely well made game overall and it is quite intriguing. They have also added the pinch the screen to zoom in feature which was a very good idea because some things are a little small and I have seen no blurring if the scenes when I zoom which is fantastic. They took great care in the making if this game and I have spotted no `bugs` either. I highly recommend this game to HOG lovers I feel you will be quite happy with it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The movie had great special effects a great story line an asorbing plot and very believable if you got into you could relate to the charaters which lead to a very enjoyable experience. 5 stars plus easily!
B000N3AXQU|5.0|I thought this might be like Rocky 5, but this film is so great.  It's sad, but you also see a side of Rocky you haven't seen before.  There is an alternate ending, but I am glad Sly stuck with his instinct and chose the one he did.  Highly recommended.
B004GISPEA|3.0|When I had first looked at it I had only seen bits and pieces of the film and said to myself that looks interesting so I bought it but after getting it and looking at all the way through. I thought to myself what a let down and waste of good money
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This is a good movie about a man who has to live ground hogs day over and over again. That would be a spoiler in itself if it werent the plot of the movie. Anyway its a good movie as I said and its also a funny movie. I would reccommend it and you should see it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is a great movie, in my opinion it is much better than the second move Daniel Craig played in.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Fresh as always. Clancy is always on top of his game. The book was difficuly to put down once you started
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This is an awsome movie that will have you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this movie to friends and family.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The changing story held your interest thruogh out the book. When you thought you had it figured out the story changed enough to keep interest stimulated.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series.  I wish we didn't have to wait until next January for the next season!  While waiting, I will watch the movie &#34;Gosford Park&#34;, which is similar and written by the same person.

0785152458|1.0|I read the first Kick-Ass a couple of years ago and loved it. Mainly because of the originality of the story: what would happen if (super) heroes really existed. I always wanted to know how the story continued, so bought this. It was a major disappointment.<br /><br />The story is very basic (nothing original) and you have loads of unnecessary violence that contributes nothing to it: toddlers being killed, high school girls being raped, decapitations, etc.<br /><br />If you're looking for an explicitly violent comic, never minding the story, this is definitely for you. But this is not what the first one was, or the reason why most of us loved it.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|The Descendants starring George Clooney is another winning film from the handsome actor. To be honest, I was never a fan of Clooney's earlier work. I just never thought he had real acting chops, it wasn't until I saw him in &#34;Up in the Air&#34; did I start to take notice. I truly feel Clooney should stick to dramatic roles and The Descendants is no exception. He is funny, naive, and completely charming as Matt King, a lawyer who's wife has been seriously hurt in a boating accident. Matt is not a hands-on kind of parent, his two young daugthers both have some emotional, behavorial problems and he must take the sole parent role when he gets news that his wife's condition is not improving. I also really liked Judy Greer in this film, she's so delightful and she has great chemistry with Clooney. I love this film, it's got some unexpected funny moments and it's also serious which are the kind of films that I found the most entertaining. Give this film a try, Clooney received an Oscar nomination for this film and it's pretty obvious why. Enjoy!

B00065GX64|5.0|This movie is unheard of in terms of amazement.  It was so ahead of its time in every aspect.  This particular set is great because the booklet has interviews, remarks from critics and the special features are epic!  Watch it!!!
1439102813|5.0|An awesome book! i could related since my grandfather had Alzheimer's. Helped me understand what he was going through. Great book, didn't want to put it down. Now reading the next book. Left neglected by same author! Awesome!
B00122KUEG|5.0|I believe this is one her most underated albums.  There is something special in every song.  I recommend it highly for all Madonna fans.
B00005N5RM|4.0|Very rarely does a remake out class the original.  The 1988 version of The Blob is one of those rare underrated gems that came along before remakes became commonplace and it is at (least in my opinion) much better than the original 60's version.  The story and performances work well and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. The special effects are fun and gruesomely impressive in most shots.

B0097NGUJG|5.0|This band is odd, the lyrics often indecipherable, and the odd piano thrown in makes this band quirky enough to be totally fresh! The deep base beats, the mellow tones and makes this my fave new band. BUY the whole album, you will no regret it. I have listened to it more than 20 times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I think it's so far the best game I've got/played in my entire life!!!!! PS: DID I MENTION THAT I LOVE THIS GAME A LOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
030758836X|5.0|The author alternates chapters between the two main characters. You get to know them well, both their visible personality and what's going on inside. At a point late in the book, I couldn't stop reading. Peel a vegetale, read a chapter, set the table, read a chapter, etc. Sometimes it's a little quirky, but a great read throughout.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was the mot interesting book i have ever read in my whole life. Best book ever you should really read this book, everyone should read it in my opinion
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|With the Kindle Fire HD you end up with so much unused bits and pieces when you uninstall something it is astounding. This helps keep your kindle cleaner and more responsive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app, My Horse, is a very cute app. It could be an app really mostly for kids, but if any adults at it, I wouldn't judge them in any way. This app also shows responsibility because you have to check in on your horse(s) from time to time and do the activities you earn and take care of your horse(s). You can enter competitions too; but you have to train your horse before it. One more thing is, is that you can get friends and send them gifts or give them gifts. So, in conclusion, this app is very fun and entertaining and I highly recommend it.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest, like use it everyday love. I got it for my kindle but when i tried pinning something it wouldn't let me choose which board. :(  nice that it is right there for convenience but its annoying when i have to go back on my laptop and correct where the pins went

B006HL9G10|2.0|I haven't read the other reviews so I don't know if this is happening on all phones, but on my Galaxy Nexus the \\"screen dimmer\\" option does not work, which means I cannot use this app. The app also does not work if the screen is manually shut off, which is why I assume they added what was supposed to be a dimmer.<br /><br />I cannot use the app with the screen on for multiple reasons - I have an Super AMOLED screen, which this app, if the screen is left on, can cause screen burn-in permanently damaging my display, it also drains battery life quickly with the screen on, and I meditate at night and the glare even with my eyes closed is irritating.<br /><br />My system screen timeout is set to 30 seconds and works fine when this app is not running but this app keeps the screen on at all times and overrides the set timeout. I have the app option checked to dim the screen, which is supposed to shut off the backlight, but as I said, it does not shut it off or dim it even slightly.<br /><br />I've tried resetting the settings several times, rebooting, using the app both on battery and plugged in, but it never works. I let it go for 15 minutes to see if it had it's own dimmer timer set but it never shut off. I couldn't let it go any longer for fear of damaging my display. Not to mention that the amount of time was already too long for it to kick in and still be useful. If I manually turn off the display, the app stops, so there is simply no way to use it.
B008VBYN80|5.0|pretty good game but it needs some tune ups :) overall perfectly great and decent rts. I approve this game for casual players
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|A good solid album where Burdon returns to the roots music he's never ventured far from.  Blues, hard rock, some gospel-inflected songs (\\"The River is Rising\\" is a stunner)and a nice tribute to the late great Bo Diddly.  This CD isn't going to overthrow \\"My Secret Life\\" as his solo masterpiece but it's a nice bit of work.  My only `criticism'?  Personally, I would have preferred a few more ballads in the mix (like the wonderful Celtic-inflected \\"Factory Girl' or the hauntingly sinister and mysterious \\"The Secret\\", both from \\"Secret Life\\"). Still his cover of Mark Cohn's ballad \\"Medicine Man\\" is admirable and \\"27 Forever\\" is also a poignant ballad, a dark, smoky and whisky-soaked tribute to his old friends, Jim and Jimi.  As far as the rockers go, \\"Water\\" and \\"Old Habits Die Hard\\" are just great blistering numbers, two of the best tracks here.<br />It's impossible to conclude this review without mentioning \\"Invitation to the White House\\", a strong slow blues with a great arrangement that seems to reflect both Burdon's sympathy for (and subtle disillusion with) President Obama.<br />Burdon has a good band backing him on these songs and I particularly enjoyed the keyboard work.  The organ was integral to the sound of the original Animals and I've always suspected Dylan had \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\" (the first true folk rock recording) in the back of his mind when he and his band were arranging his masterpiece  Highway 61 Revisited.<br />So great to see the man still recording and sounding strong as ever!  Despite \\"27 Forever\\", I'm glad Mr. Burdon decided to stick around for awhile.  Here's to Fate and Time allowing more recordings as wonderful as this one.
0307346617|5.0|I love a good zombie story....I liked the style it was written as multiple interviews with individuals from around the world. By the end of the book you have a clear picture in your head of how mankind fought and survived in a world of zombies. Easy to read and held my interest.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I previously had this CD. Loaned it to a son who seems to think he does not have it so had to buy it again. For anyone not familiar with the musical compositions of Ennio Morricone, this is a treat, especially with Yo-Yo Ma interpreting the scores of Morricone. The sound track music composed by Morricone cover such a wide spectrum that it is like a dinner with many courses. From the scores for the spaghetti westerns to the haunting score for \\"The Mission\\" and \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" it is possible to be transported into another time and space dimension. One of the theme songs from \\"The Mission\\" , \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\" has become a well known vocal song for Il Divo as \\"Nella Fantasia\\". The sound track score transports the listener to a time of floating in music. At an age of over 80 yrs, Morroconi is still composing and conducting. It is possible to see the influence of the Italian sensibility in his music-it might be difficult to see how his music relates to Clint Eastwood in the Spaghetti western movies, but Eastwood also composes music so he would also reflect the moods of transporting to another time and place in his music--possibly he was also influenced by Morriconi.
B009MO57H6|3.0|As in the Lord of the Rings films, if you know the material, you're likely to get more out of the film. That's not to imply that someone who is new to `Resident Evil' cannot enjoy this movie; in fact, a brief synopsis on what has happened is given at the early start of the film to relieve confusion. Yet, even with this explanation, the film is handed over to fans of the popular game series without apology. Also, one gets the sense that the raw energy and feel of the game is directly translated into the movie. A thinking piece about humanity, the purpose of life, salvation and all of that take a seat way in the back while special effects ride this vehicle into kingdom come! But you know what, neither the filmmaker nor the producers, nor advertising agencies said anything about making the RE films synonymous with finding inner peace or reaching Nirvana. They are a spectacle if I've ever watched one - full of insane action sequences & visual effects.<br /><br />Oh yes, the filmmaker knows his audience well enough to deliver the goods.<br /><br />If I have one small criticism, it is simply that despite all of Alice's confrontations, putting herself in danger to save mankind and so on, it would be nice to see her react in a manner that says more about who she is as a person - especially when (SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT) she isn't necessarily one of a kind and mind manipulation is easy as Sunday morning. Watching Alice strut her stuff, I can't help but recall loosely Kurt Russell's persona of Snake Plissken from John Carpenter's \\"Escape from New York\\". I feel that Alice would benefit from some of his anti-hero qualities. He doesn't hold an allegiance to any organization and only looks out for his own interests. I feel like it's beginning to be implied, but not yet fully developed. Perhaps in the next film?<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're a fan of the series, watching this is a no brainer. If you like stylized action sequences & back to back special effects, it's a funmovie to watch any evening. If you're looking for something with more meat, as opposed to frosting, yet still want to watch something starring Milla Jovovich, give The Messenger a watch but be forewarned about it's historical inaccuracies. All in all, I think Jovovich is capable of delivering an award winning performance, given the right director and opportunity. Unfortunately, I also think she has been stereotyped into films like these and \\"Fifth Element\\" type.
1400069807|3.0|NYT journalist Michael Moss spent three and one-half years looking at how big food companies get away with producing products that undermine the health of its customers. Their goal - making us all 'heavy users.' Moss contends they do this by manipulating salt, sugar and fat to addict us. Their formulations are far from accidental - actually the result of careful studies to establish the levels of those 'narcotics' to addict us, sometimes even using brain scans to study how we react to their offerings. Per Moss, sugar is the meth of processed food ingredients, while fat is a smoother, but just as powerful operator. Salt is another essential ingredient, per Moss.<br /><br />On the other hand, a recent review of scientific studies on fat in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded 'there is no convincing evidence that saturated fat causes heart disease.'<br /><br />The processed-food industry accounts for about 70% of the calories Americans consume. In April of 1999, twelve men who controlled America's largest food companies met at Pillsbury headquarters to discuss America's growing weight problem and the potential backlash they faced as a consequence of increased diabetes and signs of hypertension and heart disease. A Yale professor of psychology and public health was proposing that the processed-food industry be seen as a public health menace, with the toll taken by poor diet rivaling that of tobacco. More than half of American adults were then considered overweight, with nearly one-quarter defined as obese. The number of kids had more than doubled since 1980, and had reached 12 million in 1999, higher now.<br /><br />The first presenter, Kraft's V.P. Michael Mudd, suggested reducing salt, sugar and fat, perhaps by imposing industry-wide limits, as well as creating a code to guide nutritional aspects of food marketing, especially to children. Then came General Mills CEO Stephen Sanger, who reminded the group that consumers were 'fickle' - sometimes worrying about sugar, then fat at other times. General  Mills offered products to satisfy dieters as well as those focused on taste, and would not pull back. That effectively ended the meeting.<br /><br />Today, one in three adults is considered obese, along with one in five children.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: Interesting, but hard to evaluate. For example, one of the easiest ways to cut sugar intake is to consume diet drinks instead. But now experts are saying those create as much or more weight gain. And the argument over whether being overweight shortens lives is still ongoing.ng about sugar, then fat at other times.

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Loved the first three; this one not quite as much. While I would much rather it be available than not, it wasn't quite as good as LOTR. Of course, it's a different story, certainly written for a younger audience. As such, not sure how realistic it was to stretch it out so much.<br /><br />The parts I felt didn't work were those parts that are not in the book; like the continuing adventures of Azog; as well as the dwarves themselves, who were either too cartoonish (Balin) or too hero human-ish (Thorin). I don't think the Balin portrayed made a likely future Lord of Moria.Nor were the sets were not as artistically creative as in LOTR. Didn't greatly care for the ghostly Necromancer scenes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|SOLITAIRE is of course highly addictive, so it helps that the graphics are crisp and clear. It's a great time waster. I haven't found the between-games ads to be too intrusive. I like it and recommend it if you're looking for a basic, free game.

B000LB7G00|4.0|If you work in 3D programs, use 3D features in Photoshop, or use GoogleEarth a lot, this is worth every penny. The build is very solid, and the mouse is weighted so there is no movement while using it on a hard surface. The ease of navigating around in 3D is night and day compared to using a standard mouse and keyboard. All of the customization options for which axis does what, the buttons, sensitivity, etc. make it truly a personalized navigation experience.<br />For a little extra money, the 3Dconnexion SpaceMouse Pro is a big improvement with expanded features.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|The book is really good except it needs more mathematical words though. Thank you though. I will continue to use this book. I give this book 3 stars.

B005H5H3LW|5.0|When I was growing up I remember getting home from school on Wednesdays to watch Battle of the Planets and Star Blazers.  I have always loved Star Blazers and when I saw the trailers for a live action version...well I was very excited.  Of course it didn't release in the US and this version is in Japanese with English sub-titles.  For most Anime fans that isn't an issue.  I, however, am not a huge fan of that.  I remember the US voices to Star Blazers.  Still, this looked amazing.<br /><br />A couple of important notes...this isn't the same story as the TV show...it is different. Better in many ways, more adult, deeper characters and motivations, but its also only 2 hours and you lose significant detail.  This version of the story is more Japanese than the original and is darker.  It makes the entire journey from beginning to end much more of an emotional roller coaster and the payoff is significantly better.<br /><br />The SFX are wonderful and realistic.  I wish that this was a 24 episode show so that I could see so much more of the space battles.  Derek Wildstar has always been one of my favorite characters from SciFi and Kodai in this version lives up to my expectations.  He is both brooding and bravado, both anger and control, and Kimura does a wonderful job of pulling it off.  At times you dislike him and want him to grow up, and when he does you begin to realize why Capitan Okita wanted him on this mission.  Capitan Okita is perhaps my one disappointment in the film.  Capitan Avatar is a great character, he guides Wildstar and mentors him.  Okita doesn't have that chance in his short amount of screen time and comes off as gruff and distant most of the time.  Making Nova into a woman and Black Tiger pilot (Yuji Mori) goes squarely in the pattern of the new BSG.  In a way she is a more powerful character, but Kodai still has the opportunity to shine.  The casting of Dr Sado as a woman was brilliant and she really captures his humor that lightens up the darkness.<br /><br />If you remember the original, then this really is a must see.  If you never saw Star Blazers, then this is a good solid Sci-Fi flick with great SFX and deep characters who fight ultimate evil with little hope to win, and who doesn't love that story?.<br /><br />If you remember the original, then this really is a must see.

B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was very good, however, if you had not read the books beforehand, it would have been very difficult to make sense of the movie!  They did follow the books, to a certain extent, but left out a lot of critical information.  I would recommend this advice to anyone wanting to watch a movie based on a book: read the book (s) first, then watch the movie!  That way you can mentally add all the details that the movie left out because of time limitations.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game I hope u make a number two and make it better cause this one kinda sucks so do better
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Being comletely new to Angry Birds of any type, I felt some hesitation in putting it on my Kindle.  I'm not a 13 year old who was raised with computers & video games.  However, I found this game to be fun & silly &, despite caged animals & crashes & our hero destroying itself, unobjectionable & quite enjoyable & more than a little addictive.

0062014536|2.0|I'll admit that I had high expectations for this book to begin with because I thought the first two books in the series were fantastic, but I think that this might be the absolute worst ending to a series that I have ever read. Not to mention it was just a terrible book, the plot was awful, just seemed unplanned. I don't think that it was unplanned in an unconventional way, it was just lazily planned and terrible. I am so disappointed, almost everything that made the first two books so interesting was gone in this one. There wasn't really any further character development, except for Hana, but she didn't really seem to be a very developed character to begin with so any additional information was really adding to her character. I don't think Julian really has much more than one sentence in the whole book and I really liked him as a character in the second book, in this one he's just there. He was a pretty interesting character in Pandemonium, and I was looking forward to him being a main part of this book. Alex has a little more going on with his story, but not much. Lena is still an interesting character to read about, but there's nothing that really makes her stand out in this book like in Pandemonium or Delirium. To be honest, towards the end of the book, I really just lost interest in all of the characters and the story. I thought the ending was way too open ended and then throwing in a \\"thought provoking\\" message about tearing down walls... This series was not that subtle, we get it already. It seems like Lauren Oliver wrote this book the night before it was due to the publisher and that was the only conclusion she could come up with. I wish that I had stopped reading after Pandemonium, now the series is completely ruined for me. This was hands down the worst ending to a series I have ever read. I wouldn't even recommend starting this series because of this book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Could not put it down. Great humor,great caracters,great story.A short,fun read.I will be looking for more works from the author.

B003JH8LPW|4.0|This book is page turner just like all of Dan Brown's books. The ideas aren't particularly realistic, but this is fiction and I overlooked some of that. This is not Dan Brown at his best, but it is good and I recommend the read. It is perfect for the casual reader that needs something for a plane flight. Dan Brown is also the Author of The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Deception Point, all of which I would strongly recommend.

0316228532|2.0|Perhaps I missed the point of this book.  Perhaps the point was to bring to light the struggles an imperfections dealt with among all of the classes in this seemingly idyllic town.<br />This book was depressing, to say the least.  I had hoped for a tiny granule of positive to negate a portion of the negative, but it was a futile hope.<br />Drug abuse, child abuse and neglect, spousal abuse, mental illness, grief and despair, alcoholism, rape, molestation, spite, greed...<br />Every negative aspect of humanity was present among the characters in this story.<br />Silver lining?  None.<br />I put down this book regretting the time spent reading it, with no intention of ever cracking its cover again.<br />J.K. Rowling has a gift.  The story was well written.  The characters were well developed.  The language was mature and descriptive.<br />It's the subject matter I didn't care for.

0345525558|5.0|This was our book club selection which I'm so glad it was. I don't know if I would have ever read it otherwise. Which would have been my loss. This a beautiful book. Wonderfully written. The story is about forgiveness and second chances. It also gives the reader a look into the foster care system in this country. I also loved that it includes the meaning of all the flowers. I loved this book.

1936608898|4.0|It's very informative, a lot that I already knew and a lot I didn't. I found it hard to get into at first, as it's confusing that they throw in experiences that some people have had right smack in the middle of what you are reading. Once you &#34;train&#34; yourself to scan over them, it moves faster. Also I found there was a lot of BLAH BLAH BLAH that I could scan right over and not bother reading as it meant absolutely nothing to me, TMI (TOO MUCH INFO) ... Very few pictures of recipes, BUT not sorry I bought it.
B00AIBZLVY|1.0|My family and I always enjoy a good horror movie together; the scarier, the better. Mama is just the opposite; not scary and not good. The best part of the movie was when the credits rolled across the screen, for it meant we could leave the theater as quickly as possible. There is absolutely no reason to waste your valuable time (trust me, you won't get it back) on this pic when there are numerous others out there. Save your money for something worthwhile....

0062073192|5.0|It's a nice complement to the series. I feel like I know John as a character better now, and it was nice to see some of the things referenced in the show on paper, and to get insight on some of the things that aren't but are significant to Dean and Sam's characterization, especially early on in the show.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I loved this movie, except for the scene where the coach goes crazy and chases Scrooge.  Seemed like a wasted scene, but the rest of the movie was fantastic.  Such real-looking animation!  Give me more like this!

B005LAIHSQ|2.0|I would like to give my compliments to the editors who put together the previews for this movie.  I was really unimpressed.  It being a Blu-ray did help the visuals, but I won't watch this movie ever again.  Give me the old Disney version any day.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|With this album Britney Spears makes the transition from bubblegum pop to full on dance. It's by far her best album with a wide range of styles from R&B (Outrageous) to trip-hop (Breathe on Me)  and Britney delivers all tracks with equal aplomb. There a few ballads here as well.<br /><br />Best Tracks:<br />Toxic (The electropop WW#1 smash.  About being addicted to a bad boy.  Britney's vocals are very sultry & seductive)<br />Showdown (Electropop song about makeup sex)<br />Breathe On Me (Trip-hop/Trance song about being so sexually in tune with someone you don't even need to touch each other to climax, just breathe.  Great sensual vocals)<br />The Hook Up (Dancehall song about hooking up)<br />Everytime (Haunting ballad about a failed relationship with gentle, fragile vocals.  Britney wrote this one practically by herself)<br /><br />Worst Tracks<br />(I Got That) Boom Boom (Britney sounds great and the beat is ok, but the Yin-yang twins, who are heavily featured on the track, ruin it)<br />Brave New Girl (Too Disney sounding and doesn't fit with the rest of the album beat-wise, but lyrically, it's in the zone, considering it's about a girl who goes just to pick up a guy).
B005LAIGZU|5.0|What's not to like about this movie?  Of course I've heard the common complaint about the actors, but anyone who knows anything about the movie knows that these guys are real Navy SEALS aka badasses.  If you don't get goosebumps when they roll in with the mini-gun, you are unamerican.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|Britney Spears 7th studio album, Femme Fatale, is a return to form after her lackluster 6th album, Circus.  Where the latter was filled with mostly bland pop, this album is full of interesting and varied dubstep tracks, as well as four bonus tracks that include dubstep, rock, and R&B, although, lyrically, Circus is better.<br /><br />The standout tracks are:<br />The lead track, Hold it Against Me, with its edgy verses, fluffy chorus, and industrial bridge.<br />Inside Out, a dubstep/R&B track about breakup sex.<br />Seal it With a Kiss, a dubstep track with a killer bassline and seductive vocals<br />He About to Lose Me, a bonus track, where we get to hear Britney sing without effects<br /><br />Weak tracks:<br />Trouble For Me is the only that's bad and it's not even bad.  Just mediocre compared to the rest of the songs.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I loved all the music and it is so funny. Everytime I watch, there is a funny line that I didn't catch before...Hope they make a sequel!!

B008HK3XKO|5.0|Bought this one for my HD and works great. Shipped and received on time. No problem found in using it.
0763644765|4.0|I purchased this along with a potty training DVD to help my son get a better understanding that his potty chair is the place where he's SUPPOSED to go potty and not just an alternate place for him to go.  The book is very simple and well illustrated.  My son even has it memorized and likes to 'read' it to me.  He gets excited about the prospect of wearing 'undies' now and the book is a useful aid in teaching potty training principles.  I recommend it!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|best game yet.<br />make more like it.  had a lot of challanges to do to go the next level.  looking for more.

B00797MB0O|1.0|I love Charlize Theron but I hated this movie.  I remember laughing at the commercial but this is NO comedy.  Whew...rough.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is terribly addictive and amazing. The graphics and the game play is perfect. I truly believe that the game should be played by everyone. It's also perfect for practicing reaction skills.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app very addictive I started playing on a whim and immediately loved it. I just wish it was easier getting gems for game play.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Absolutely enjoyed this book. It Had been a while since I read something that gripped me like this. The characters and the story are not your typical good guys against bad guys and more a story of reality. Even as the reader you don't know who you are rooting for or who is actually noble or not.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Great game for someone who likes the TV show but I can't believe this is meant for children:<br />- The amount of purchasing available in the game at one click is pretty high (you can disable this)<br />- The game continuously bribes me to log into facebook to get points  (why would a child have a facebook)<br />- occasionally a freezes  (prompting fear that you've broken the kindle)<br />- Everything is time sensitive in this game which makes no sense for the typical MLP age group.<br />Asking a child to choose between waiting hours or pay in points earned in the game (which can also be bough with real life currency), is quickly frustrating.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|nicely programmed and very entertaining. haven't played many games like this but for my fist one it lived up to standards
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is good but it won't connect to any online servers. My brother has it and we are in the same room but it doesn't connect. Please reply.
0394721780|4.0|I had the original of this book already, but after so many years use in the kitchen it was hardly a book anymore.<br />This one that came in right before my birthday was really a &#34;GIFT&#34;.<br />Thank you very much<br /><br />Helena
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|The game is cool to play, you can get rare animals, and you get to play guest,and you can go get endangered and injured animals.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|Nothing fancy, but it works.  The wire feeds down the center of the threaded shaft, turns out the hold in the side and you tighten down the knurled piece to hold it in place.  As I said, it's nothing fancy, but it works.  This is an inexpensive way to get a dozen sets of banana plugs.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so fun it's just like the game at the fairs but it doesn't take your quarters I haven't had to buy any coin or anything you play all your coins go do something for a couple of hours and all your coins are back so fun!!!!!!
B008133MDK|5.0|I loved season one, but season two is even better. Cumberbatch and Freeman have the perfect dynamic personalities to portray Sherlock and Watson. Looking forward to season three.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|L. Frank Baum’s Oz stories will make a wonderful series of films. There’s so much adventure and depth in them. MGM’s 1939 movie musical, THE WIZARD OF OZ was a hit at the time of its release and is a true classic piece of cinema. The public loves it to this day and the world of Oz has remained at the forefront of popular culture (just take a look at the success of the Broadway show WICKED, for example). However, the 1939 movie has such a strong hold on popular conscience that it makes it incredibly difficult to begin a new series by starting with Baum’s first book, THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ. Disney tried to circumvent this issue by making a sequel film to the book in the 1980s with RETURN TO OZ. Though that film has gained a cult following and respect, it was initially a box office failure that was mostly panned by critics. Twenty years later, Disney is trying to circumvent MGM’s stronghold on the Oz series by returning to Oz again. However, this time it’s in the form of a prequel to Baum’s first book, entitled OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL.<br /><br />The story begins in 1905 Kansas with a traveling con man magician with Baum’s Bros. Circus Co. named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) who performs under the moniker “Oz the Great and Powerful” (his real name is actually so long that most people just call him Oz for short anyway). Oscar spends his time seducing young women and duping audiences into believing he’s something that he is not. However, despite his wily nature, there is goodness in him, as witnessed when he’s unable to grant a young girls wish to heal her legs. Also, despite being a conman, Oscar yearns to do something great and change the world like his hero, Thomas Edison.<br /><br />It’s not too long before Oscar is swept away in a Kansas funnel cloud and transported to the magical land of Oz. Upon his arrival he is greeted by a beautiful woman named Theodora (Mila Kunis). She believes he is the great wizard mentioned in a prophecy who has arrived to set Oz free from the clutches of The Wicked Witch. Theodora is also a witch, but one that is good. She escorts Oscar to The Emerald City to meet with her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) who is the steward of the city after the death of the King by hands of the Wicked Witch. Oscar soon gets thrown into the politically trouble in Oz. He befriends a small flying monkey name Finley (Zach Braff), heals a tiny China Girl (Joey King), and meets yet another witch named Glinda (Michelle Williams). Everyone in Oz believes Oscar to be The Wizard spoken of in prophecy and that he will overthrow the rule of the Wicked Witch. Everyone, but Oscar, that is.<br /><br />The cinematography of the film is well done and the last action sequences of the piece (when Oz reveals his “true” form) are particular spectacular. The acting is done well, particularly by Mila Kunis and Zach Braff. The movie also does a great job of beginning a new story, yet nodding it’s head to the MGM 1939 movie (e.g. look in the background for horses of different colors and the Munchkins like to sing).<br /><br />The movie does have a few flaws. The biggest is that James Franco just doesn’t seem right for the part of Oz. He’s got the look of a con man about him, but he never has the feel of one. Whenever he cons someone, it just feels like a little kid dressed up in adult clothes who has no idea what he’s doing and is just playing make believe. I realize that’s part of the intent of the story. However, the character of Oz should be more forceful and Franco just doesn’t give Oz the gravitas that he needs. Women will still like him because he’s good looking and charming, but the emotional depth of the character just isn’t there.<br /><br />Also, there middle section of the film is rather uneven. The opening sequences and the finale fit together perfectly. However, the middle section of the movie doesn’t transition very well from one moment to the next and the quick changing of sequences is sure not to sit well with some people (“Why was that middle section so long, is sure to be heard”).<br /><br />Overall, I was pleased with OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL. As a fan of the Baum’s stories, the movie is about what I expected. It’s not necessarily a great movie, but it is a good one and makes a good setup for some wonderful Oz stories yet to come.ences is sure not to sit well with some people (“Why was that middle section so long, is sure to be heard”).<br /><br />Overall, I was pleased with OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL.

B007URVZJ6|3.0|This is somewhat beneficial to helping you publish on Kindle.  It reallys needs to be expanded to include many more details and answer more questions.
B005HXGE9G|3.0|Sometimes when an artist revisits earlier work, there are unexpected subtleties explored in the new versions. For example, I enjoyed OSI's Re: Free, which revisited their Free album because it was a different take with different emotional emphasis.<br /><br />In this album, though, I struggled to find anything to make it worth listening to as an alternative to the original works. I came up short for the most part. The reworked orchestral versions on disc 1 lack energy, and the orchestral arrangements seem prosaic, like a mediocre movie soundtrack. They aren't awful, just not something that I want to go listen to on any kind of regular basis. &#34;In Your Eyes&#34;, for example, was quite powerful on the original album &#34;So&#34;, but just wandered around pointlessly in this longer version. Gabriel's vocals seem forced and unemotional, which doesn't fit a highly emotional song.<br /><br />The best of the lot for me was &#34;Don't Give Up&#34;, for which the orchestral mood fits the lyrics quite well, the orchestral arrangement was mercifully simple, and the backing vocals had a nice haunting quality not on the original.<br /><br />The pure instrumental versions on disc 2 are basically muzak-sounding versions. They're OK for background listening, I guess, but they are not something I would seek out and pay a lot of attention to.<br /><br />Gabriel fans will find some decent stuff here, but unless you really, really like orchestral rock, you might be disappointed with this.

B000V63AVY|5.0|I never understood the group. Loved the pop hooks though. I had (and wore out) Breakfast in America and was looking at replacing in digitally. Easy choice to just get this 'best of' collection. Has all the great songs on 'Breakfast' plus maybe their best song ever (Bloody well right!). Buy it and enjoy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|amazing style with new stunts and great new up-grades. this fast pace game is adicting and fun for all ages! its a definite 5 star!
B0053O89JM|5.0|I miss House, for me one of the best TV shows ever. This last season was very good, maybe not as good as the first two, but definitely better than the later ones.
B00821OX98|5.0|I was looking for something to watch while quilting and ran across Falling Skies.  I really liked it and was surprised I had not heard or seen of it before. I liked this better than the Walking Dead and that is one of the few shows I will turn the TV on for.  Watched both seasons here on Amazon and looking forward to season 3 this summer.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|If you like action movies this is for you.  Lots of martial arts, sex scenes (good type), and I know the actors loved doing this one.  Loved Russell Crowe especially.  This is especially good for a Friday or Saturday night viewing.  Just relax and plan to enjoy a light crazy action movie.  Going back now to watch it again.  So plan for a good evening's watch.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Quick delivery, just as described.  My kid can't stop playing with it and the noise is driving me nuts.  So cool he bought another one!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|As the 2nd book in the series it definitely lives up to the first. My heart ached for Ethan who is trying so badly to get his love Lena back from the darkness. You meet new characters and really begin to understand where the story is going in this second book.  Already onto book 3 by the time I got the OKAY to review this book. I'll be sad when the series is over but I'll be interested to see how the movie relates, since books are normally always the better version.
0345451325|4.0|I think reading this book really helped impress me with what Spartans really are.  The game tries, but I just want to drive, shoot aliens and blow stuff up (I tend to lose some parts of the story in the game).  If you want to learn the origin of the Spartans and how overwhelming the Covenant really is check this book out.
B0002KVULG|3.0|Back in the late 1970's or early 80's I saw a live performance of a very cool stage production of \\"Dracula\\" in San Francisco.  I remember the sets were very stark, a feeling of black and white film.  Yet with splashes of color, red in particular.  It was used for effect, much like Steven Spielberg did in \\"Schindler's List.\\"  As it turns out, this was the same adaptation that originally starred Frank Langella on Broadway.<br /><br />He was tapped to recreate his version of the ancient vampire in this 1979 film.  This version differs dramatically from the early Bela Lugosi portrayal as well as various looks coming out of the Hammer Studios in the 1960's.  This Dracula isn't very scary.  In fact we never see fangs or even a blood droplet coming from his mouth.  Langella and the producers intended it that way.  Not that director John Badham, fresh from \\"Saturday Night Fever,\\" was all that happy about it.  But this Dracula was a ladies man, first and foremost.<br /><br />The characters and the plot are close enough to the original Bram Stoker novel that no one should get lost.  Omitted is the long sequence involving an estate agent (Harker or Renfield in previous versions) travelling to Transylvania to complete the transaction.  This film begins with Drac's sea voyage coming to an end during a violent storm off the British coast in 1913.  He is discovered in a cave by Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), lured from her bed while visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan).<br /><br />After Mina's \\"death,\\" her father, the famed professor (Laurence Olivier) comes to England.  He of course, figures out what's what and sets out to destroy the Count before he can dazzle Lucy into submission.  Helping him is his friend Dr. Seward (scene stealing Donald Pleasence) and Lucy's fianc&eacute;, Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve).  None of the vampire scenes are very scary, in fact they are pretty erotic, including a long love making scene featuring some interesting use of graphics, color and lighting.  There is also a creepy use of special effects, allowing Dracula to climb a wall in his human form.  Speaking of which, we do get Dracula as a bat and a wolf more than once.<br /><br />Ultimately the film plays out like a Harlequin romantic novel.  That is, more style than substance, more sputter than sizzle.  The sets look great and John Williams adds an effective score.  An interesting but modestly effective take on the iconic Dracula.hting.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|As a lifelong Beatles fan I looked forward to this collection. All of my expectations were met. The music is awesome, the sound quality is great. I've spent hours listening to it and still can't get enough.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|The Good.<br /><br />I purchase this turntable do my to need to copy vinyl records to CDs and based on Amazon.com reviews.  The turntable worked very perfectly.  I had never owned an automatic turntable.  Really Nice.  Also, this turntable has an RIAA magnetic equalization preamp and can be connected directly to an amplifier without the magnetic equalization built in.  ie the front jacks on amplifier.  Very nice when you only need to copy a few records and you don't want to leave the turntable always connected.<br /><br />The Bad.<br /><br />Now came the &#34;fun&#34;part of my purchase.  I tried to run the included software.  I got an immediate error and the software would not even start to load.  I updated all of the MircoSoft software in my computer and tried again.  Same results.  I had a professional look at my operating software and we still could not get it to run.  My computer is a 64 bit &#34;Windows 7&#34; system.  On page 9 of the manual, I found that the Sound Forge Audio Studio LE, supplied with the turntable, would not work with XP64 and Vista64, however it should work with Windows 7.  I don't think that the software will work with any 64 bit system.<br /><br />The Ugly.<br /><br />I contacted &#34;Sony Support&#34; looking for a software update, found none.  I finally found a way to get help via an Email sent to Sony.  Sent in a request for help.  Had an answer in 12 hours (great).  &#34;Call Sound Forge Audio, a division of Sony.&#34;  I called and got a continusiouly repeating meassage, &#34;Due to the extreme number of calls, please hang up and contact a website where I could get help.  I tried the phone number all day.  The message never went away even if you tried to stay on and wait it out.  I went to the website and guess what?  I was right were I started.  Sony put me in a loop with no end.<br /><br />I finally looked at the reviews again, but this time I also read the bad reviews.  Had I done this before I purchase the turntable, I would nothave bought it.  There seems to be two major problems.  The turntable does not work and getting Sony to fix it is a trick.  Thank God mine works.  The second problem is the very poor software that comes with it and the lack of support from Sony and the Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio LE division.<br /><br />In Summary.<br /><br />A good automatic turntable at very good cost,<br /><br />But it comes with a very poor software package and NO vendor support.  Also the manual that comes with the turntable is very poorly written and the manual that is down loadable for the software is not of much more help.  I don't think that whoever wrote the manuals actually ever saw or used this turntable or its software.<br /><br />C. Richard Meyer

I liked the concept of how there is an accident but also Mia' s life is and has been explained throughout the story. And since I'm from Oregon I could really relate to the landmarks. Clearly need to get book 2.

1400069807|4.0|I just started this book after reading several food-linked concerned books and how the food industry is really creating a population suited to its best needs. I can't put this book down. Oh - the choices in the supermarket have taken on a whole new light...and not for the positive. Yet, I am glad that I can read this book and gain information as to how things work, since as a consumer we are only exposed to very highly creative and well funded marketing but the big food producing giants. Will continue to read this book with excitement and I must say I rarely buy books around all the hype (this just came out). However, with a topic like this I think it will do every reader good to learn more about what is occurring in specifically America today. Can't give it five stars yet as I'm not quite finished with the book yet :)
0385720920|5.0|Chuck has a wonderful ability to construct a novel that is thought provoking and stylistically intriguing. I believe \\"Choke\\" is a perfect novel to describe a very self-absorbed, narcissistic American society. At times it is prophetic to the extent individuals will go to receive attention and approval. And to think this novel was written before the explosion of the popularity of social networking. This is the perfect novel for the individual who is sick of viewing photos of meals that are about to be consumed by Facebook friends.

B00AHXIC50|5.0|Awesome Album. Love Bruno Mars, he makes some amazing music and it varies, so you always get a complete scale of music taylored to your taste.  Awesome!!!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Better than the first Temple Run, except for the fact that it seems to be more sensitive to the touch than the first game. And when you try to jump sometimes, the monkey gets you. I may just have a glitchy download, however. Fun overall!
B00899DR40|5.0|This is my first Justin Bieber album, and i must say ....i really enjoy this album alot.  Hope this kid keeps up the good work and spiral out of control like so many other young artist
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|A complete, real emotional journey from a perspective I have always wondered about. There are no clean resolutions here, but a sharp and heart-rending prose that captured me completely.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|Love this acoutic album.  Love it even better than the originial album. Love the arrangements and love the vocals.  Great artist if he keeps it together and not spiral out of control.

B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Heard them on the CMA's & like their &#34;simple style&#34;. The girl singer has the most beautiful singing voice ever. I am learning to play the Mandolin after hearing &#34;Better Dig Two&#34;!  Very talented group. Woodman71
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Easy reading with a heart wrenching story of humankind. If we could only accept everyone without reservation or judgement like the main character.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game everyday and I love it. I love how I can personalize it so it fits me instead of being the regular board.
B004SRNH10|5.0|The wife couldn't figure this out at first but it's an easy download (in my opinion) and was required to view her books. She loves it now.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't sun up intro this space my thoughts on this emotionally wonderful book. Read it, you won't be sorry.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is one of the wife's favorite games. Got the tablet up and running while she was in the hospital, she was very happy to see I got this for her. :) Classic game, still very fun today if you have time to burn.

B005Y1B3Q0|3.0|Thought this movie would've lived up to what these guys used to do. Nah, typical Hollywood BS movie for these days. Watched once, really didn't hold my attention well. Poor plot line.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Bought this for my Granddaughter and she loves it. I play it myself and enjoy it too. The games are easy enough for younger kids while still staying interesting for for the older ones..

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Although late getting on the bandwagon, I am now a complete fan of this wonderful drama!  I enjoyed the cunning ways of the Dowager and even O'Brien.  Thoroughly transfixed by Matthew's eyes and look forward to see what becomes of his relationship with Lady Mary.  Can't wait to start Season 3!
B000JIHP88|5.0|When we first got this mobile it stopped working after just a few weeks. Like other reviewers said it kept getting stuck and wouldn't turn. However, I emailed Fisher Price about the problem and they IMMEDIATELY sent me a new mobile for free. It arrived a couple days after I sent the email with an apology. It was by far the best customer service experience I have ever had. I am really impressed.<br />Now for the review of the working mobile. It is really great. The music it plays is really soothing and puts my baby right to sleep. I also love the remote to turn the music off. I rock the baby near the crib/mobile and then when he falls asleep I turn the mobile off with the remote and then put the baby in the crib. Perfect.<br />When the baby wakes up he likes to stare up at the little moving creatures and leaves that go up and down. So it entertains him for a while, which I love. Like I said - I can't live without it...now that it works.
1410438791|5.0|I bought this book at Goodwill for $4.99. It has a gorgeous and beautiful cover and that alone is what made me buy it.  I come home, look up the book here on Amazon to see what the reviews are and found out it's the last book to the \\"Fever\\" series. My question is, is this book good to read in itself. Or are the other 4 books important to understand it?
0446547654|5.0|The book was a great read and I love Nicholas Sparks. I have all of his books and I will continue to buy them online when future ones come out. It is hassle free and easy!
B00005OWIU|5.0|A must for any Harry Potter fan. Beautiful to listen to takes you back into he movie . Love to listen to it in the car on long drives.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It is a lot like the real game - not a lot of action, not a lot of reward and costs a lot to play. You may like it, but i'm just much more of an action oriented app-gamer.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you're considering downloading Season 2, you've seen Season 1, which speaks for itself!  This show is a nice change from the usual drab on network television.
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|This series is interesting and my husband loves it more than I do, which is why the 4 stars. The story line is interesting, the costuming and sets are terrific. What keeps me from 5 stars is that some of this is just a bit beyond what is &#34;necessary&#34; to show. The intimation of events is often more effective than actual depictions in film/shows, in my opinion, and I hope that in subsequent seasons there is more of that rather than the &#34;let's see what we can get away with showing&#34; attitude. Some plot lines were also a bit contrived and beyond belief. Overall, a quality show, yet not the same caliber of The Soprano's, if that is what you hope for, like we did. Buscemi is great in every role I've ever seen him play. For more great Buscemi performances, see &#34;Tree's Lounge.&#34; He is magnificent in that and makes you squirm just watching him fumble through life. In Boardwalk Empire, Buscemi never disappoints even if the plot itself is missing the mark.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I bought this for an install but did not end up using it but when I need it it should work great
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Very interesting way to understand the complex personality of one of the greatest innovators of our era. The question is whether he accomplished so much despite being so hard on others or because of it.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I think this is a great graphic novel and the movie was pretty darn cool too so if you like batman you will like this
B00B49L7Y4|3.0|Good story but an Oscar? Music was generic for the time.The public spoke. Cannot understand South Africa's reaction. Maybe they hadn't heard of Bob Dylan.
0765325950|5.0|I discovered WOT a year ago looking for a fun fantasy epic to read - and one that was already complete.  I hate waiting for the next book.  Lo and behold, I was hooked almost instantly, finished through book 13 by end of the summer - and had to WAIT anyway.  Keeping LOTR on its customary pedestal, this was the most innovative, in-depth, terrific set of books I ever read and Memory of Light was worth it.  For you folks who started reading it years back, that is why I like series that are already done!  As a former soldier I loved the Seanchan - especially the air cav references - hints of Jordan's past.  But the characters were the best - especially Egwene and Nynaeve.<br /><br />This book had a satisfying ending for me - Loved it.  But I HATED losing Egwene.
B002GORUF6|5.0|Their act on Saturday Night Live was so much fun, the movie was a natural. It's still fun watching the mayhem and madness as jake and company tear up Illinois. Seeing and hearing all the fine musicians is always great. Ray Charles and Cab Calloway were wonderful.
B000MD7OKY|4.0|Great Cary Grant movie. This is good for all ages.  Beautiful French Riviera scenery. Entertaining & the video/audio was very good too.
B004U8VWLE|3.0|Even Mila Kunis couldn't light this one up. Wife recommended it. Oh well. Finally had something to think about at end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|For all you temple run fans here's a game just like it I love this game I play it every day I'm glad it's free
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I bought The Hunger Games [2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]. Unfortunately, when I received the dvd in the mail it was just the plain jane copy of the movie and since I received the movie 1 day before my wife's birthday I didn't have time to return it.  So I would just like to THANK YOU for making my purchase an awful experience.
1594744769|2.0|I don't know what the expected age group is for this book, but it feels more like a kid's book. The idea was good and even original, but it really isn't written for adults.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I enjoyed  breathe game very much.  I would recommend this 2 any1 and every1. It made me feel like I could really play!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is awesome! I love playing it in my free time! YOU SHOULD GET THIS APP!!!!!!!! IT IS WORTH IT!!!!!!!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I got this book because I was tired of working out on my Bowflex at home and not getting any results.  It wasn't the Bowflex's fault, it was just that I didn't know what I was doing.  I have bought work out books before but their recommendations always seemed generalized and complicated.  Not so with this book.  The feel that you get when you read this book is that Mike is your body builder friend that has worked out for years and developed a system that works and in this book he is going to share that system with you.  He is going to bring you along and tell you exactly what you need to do to get the body that you have always wanted.<br /><br />In Bigger, Leaner, Stronger, Mike tells you very specifically what you need to do to get results and why the plan works.  It is more than just exercises, it is a very specific training program.  He talks about the importance of diet, attitude, how the exercises should be done and why.  One of the best things is that the workouts are designed to be done in 45 minutes to an hour and you are done.  In addition to the book, you get almost another entire book in his bonus report where he gives recommendations on apps, useful equipment,and on supplements.  It is the entire program in one package.  And, if that weren't enough, you will probably get an email from him a few days after you buy the book offering help and to answer any questions.  I have written to Mike a couple of times and always get back personalized thoughtful responses.  The guy just really seems to want you to succeed.  You get all of this for $12.  It is probably the best value on Amazon.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I liked the game and hope they add more levels. It should have hints for some of the harder levels for  people that are stuck...maybe as an option. For a free game well worth playing.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|i loved this book. usually don.t waste my money on the cheeper books. . . . but not in this case.  should be made into a movie. hope this aurhor has another in the works.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We, the good citizens of Amazon would like to inform you that we are displeased with the editorial review for this movie. Anyone who favors Gollum above Bilbo or the Dwarf cast clearly has issues! Their discription of the dwarves hideous features is entirely false. The reviewer of this movie didn't watch it to appreciate its worth, or enjoy its light-hearted humor, or the intense fight sequences. He/she watched it to criticise and repromand the actors, althought they did a fully remarkable job. The use of the term &#34;soap opera&#34;  proves the bias of the previewing of the film. In conclusion, the Amazon review is inappropriate and lacking. The movie itself is Oscar worthy, along with its makeup, wardrobe, and film score, not to mention the actors themselves! My question is, how do you plan on selling this movie with such a unfavorable overview?
B006LSZECO|5.0|Entertaining and clever.  The plot  is twisted and involved .  I did not liike the way it ended, however.  MAM
B009VLX8FS|5.0|My grandaughter heard me playing this and started to sing along she is only 8. Taylor is Great! Look forard to moore
0802473156|3.0|I love the idea that my top 2-3 love languages are perhaps different from my spouse's, even my daughters'. Yet when I went through the book and took Gary Chapman's online quiz, I was disappointed at all the stereotypical questions driving me to choose that I want presents (as a woman) as a way for my man to show me love. Really? I expect more, and would love to dig deeper. This feels like &#34;5 Love Languages for Dummies.&#34; Gary, please write a more nuanced, dense book and I'll be a raving fan. I expect more of you with this worthy topic.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I'm still finishing up on reading it...it's bittersweet tale. I am enjoying it. I love reading about how a group of friends became the RHCP. All the antics of Anthony and Flea. How they coped with addiction and losing close friends. Plus learning about Kiedis' childhood and how he grew up. There is a lot I didn't know about him like the early acting and who his father is. Good stuff.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim is just my type: irreverent, wholly original, and hilarious. Where else can I learn Japanese in one page, hyper-decant slow-carb wine in 20 seconds with an immersion blender, and realize the virtues of braising meats (where 30 minutes here or there while cooking is No Big Deal). Harissa crab cakes? MLBJ? How to prevent fat gain when you binge? Tim also summarizes his slow-carb food plan even better here than in 4-Hour Body. Other faves: overlapping Venn diagrams of the circles for techniques that are &#34;common among best performers,&#34; your &#34;personal strengths,&#34; and skills &#34;infrequently taught&#34; as a way of directing you to your sweet spot for learning. Deconstructing a dinner party. A tour of Neuroland and desmopressin. Slow carb culinary tours of my favorite cities.<br />I love Tim. Major crush, majorly awesomesauce book.
B0006J28KU|5.0|How can you go wrong with Pacino and DeNiro. And throwing in Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Henry Rollins, etc. It's a win win...win win! The action scenes are AMAZING. Still some of my favorite &#34;shoot 'em up&#34; scenes. It gets deep in the both sides of the law and the two main characters professional and personal lives. Riveting!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Not sure why the science of &#34;change management,&#34; especially when it comes to food and negative thought patterns, is so difficult to decode. Duhigg does a great job here of tracking a slippery topic but after reading his suggestions, and trying them, I was underwhelmed.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|After watching 4 seasons of SOA I have been thoroughly pulled into it. The stories are tight and thought provoking. This is clearly R rated entertainment and not family friendly fare - but it is not just sex, blood and violence. While there is plenty of all of those elements, the characters are strong and well developed and the stories interesting and entertaining. Katey Sagal is outstanding and along with Ron Perlman and Charlie Hunnam, who I was not familiar with before SOA, lead a strong cast. This series is not for everyone and definitely not one for the kids, but if you like your entertainment with an edge for both your id and your ego you have found it. The seasons can stand alone but there is an arc that is best appreciated by watching in sequence. Enjoy.
B000GWE44U|4.0|Just another great Sanley Kubrick movie! I would watch it again and recommend it if you have not seen it!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I really love these games.  However this games closeup are not close enough for me.  Not as good as Return to Ravenhearst which I enjoyed very much.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is the most full featured Sodoku app I've seen.  Lots of puzzles make for days and days of puzzle fun.  Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys sodoku.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found the 2 main characters to be totally not believable with no redeeming value whatsoever other than to be self absorbed. It sounds as if this piece of so called erotica were written by a &#34;virgin author&#34; with no concept of true human sensuality and sexuality.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Better than the original and loads better than the space version.  Subtracted a star because I sometime accidentally click on something that opens the browser and exits me from the game.  I'm not opposed to ads in free apps but they shouldn't be so easily activated.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Great read, makes you think about man's future and what we Don't  know!  Clarke's mine was truly far seeing and imaginative.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Very enlightening! I hated Bush before I watched this film and Michael Moore's said it clearly why I hate him.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great little simple notepad. Easy to use! Download was fast and easy. Application was as better than I expected and was what I was looking for.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have not yet seen the film, but this book offers an amazing wealth of information. What an extraordinary research the author has put into these pages! Not for a moment I was bored reading first on Kindle and then checking sources on paper. Wanting to know more, I downloaded \\"The true story of Mary, Wife of Lincoln\\" by Katherine Helm, her niece (first published 1928 - archive.org). \\"Team of Rivals\\"  gives an extraordinary insight into Lincoln's entourage and their political and private background, the men who overcame rivalry to finally rally around the President during Civil War. No wonder Barack Obama is inspired by Lincoln!
B0086700CM|3.0|i have had some trouble with glitches on my device but then again im not sure if its just die to my device being kind of outdated or if in fact it is the game. other than the small glitches it still works perfectly fine!!!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I have watched this whole season in one weekend. Make sure you have lots of snacks and no one will bother you!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|never had a problem with this app or any freezing or glithches works smooth and has really good graphics to accompany the functionality
B008NAFU9A|4.0|Her Sweetest Downfall is a short story/ novella in The Forever girl series by Rebecca Hamilton. Although this story is a precursor to Ms. Hamilton’s debut novel, The Forever Girl-I feel can be read as a stand alone. This book is more of a companion novella and not necessarily a prequel.  However, being that I have read The Forever Girl, I found that a few questions that had cropped up through out that novel became much clearer after reading Her Sweetest Downfall.<br /><br />I will be honest and say that normally I don’t read novella’s. I’m a lover of long and lengthy novels and series’.  But (and here’s the caveat), when an Author does come along that I absolutely adore then I won’t stop at nothing to read any and all of their work. And that’s just what happened here. I was floored when I read The Forever; and that was her debut novel!!! So you bet your bottom dollar I was all over Her Sweetest Downfall.<br /><br />Ms. Hamilton is very creative when it come to world building. She doesn’t skimp on the details which richly enhances the experience of becoming invested in the characters. With that said, the main protagonists in this story, Ophelia and Ethan, are very three dimensional. So much so that I was left wanting to know more of their story; especially Ethan, which isn’t a bad thing in this circumstance.  Sometimes if I am left wanting to know more than the author has been willing to give then that has set things up nicely for the reader to come back. There will be more books added to this series and I have a feeling this is just the tip of the iceberg in The Forever Girl world.<br /><br />Also, I want to point out that a lot of information is given in this book concerning the Forever Girl world. I moves along quickly forcing one to pay close attention the the finer points the author is trying to make. I did feel some things were a bit rushed, like the relationship between Ethan and Ophelia. I think a little more time could have been spent developing their relationship and thus wouldn’t have felt as stilted. I would have loved to see a little more character development in regards to Robert and Lenore. But hey, this is a short story and well, who knows what Ms. Hamilton has in her bag of tricks when the rest of the series hits the shelves. The Forever Girl transcends space and time, so I have no doubt I will be getting answers to my burning questions in the near future.<br /><br />This read will wet the appetite of anyone who is a fan of PnR/Fantasy and wants to become familiar with Ms. Hamilton’s work. A talented young Author well on her way to very successful future.<br /><br />I give Her Sweetest Downfall 4.5 stars!
B008VBYN80|4.0|Fun building game with a PvP element. Was playing Airport City but the game developer wont fix the glitches on the kindle fire app so I started looking for a new game to play. just started but looks fun.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Love the many different combinations with all they're colors! They're just so cute! I Never thought breeding and egg-laying would be so addicting!!! LOL!!! ;-D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was really good if u r a teen and like the movie u should really read the hunger games
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A great story sweeps you up and transports you to another place, allowing the reader to disappear into a different world.  This is a marvelous story, filled with the kind of detail that only one who has lived it can provide.  God, I absolutely love this book, the writing, the imagery... all of it.  Well done, Gregory David Roberts!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  It is not as good as Downton Abbey but good.<br /><br />I hate the 'more words required' in order to submit feature.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have been a fan of Nicholas Sparks since the beginning. This book is no exception. It kept you interested. And the ending was a surprise.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy and fast to play. Large cards make for ease of identification.<br />Annoying pop up ads at the start of each game take away from enjoyment.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|After reading school related material, this is a nice refreshing change!  Writing is as expected, and material is an escape from reality....much needed escape from reality!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Good graphics, fast paced, keeps your attention.<br />Hints are very helpful when you are  getting started with the the game
B00005JLH3|5.0|Or watching this movie without the ridiculous tv edits for the 3 or 4 swear words that tbs doesn't want to play at 6 in the evening? Just as I suspected, this movie did not have commercials and thus satisfied the reason my wife bought it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this story. Could Holder be any better? He is officially my new fictional boyfriend. He has dethroned Evan Mathews :)  I loved that he wasn't perfect. He had a temper and didn't always handle everything the right way. Now, let's get to Sky. She was a breath of fresh air. She was so wonderfully sarcastic and REAL and NORMAL as much as you could be in her situation. She didn't wallow in self-pity after everything was revealed to her. I enjoyed her immensely.<br /><br />Who would have thought pinky holding would cause such sharp intakes of breathes and such strong reactions while reading a story? It was so endearing without being totally cheesy.  Look forward to reading more from her!<br /><br />P.S. Holder by far had the best line of the entire book. I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I won't actually type it b/c it might reveal a little too much about their relationship but again.....the best line. I dare to say it may be the best line I have read in a book in last 2 or 3 years.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Even though I play this game way too much and cant stop...idk what I was going to say. lets just leave it at i play his game too much.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was very good I like the tiger the best I wonder how he survived the ship rec nice book
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Its like fifty shades only backwards and with out all the sexy details.  It feels like the same characters.  I like a good love story but we need more diversity.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Suggested by my daughter.  Found the book  fascinating but probably not for everyone.  Religious aspects very deep and thought provoking.
0425074811|5.0|I was most amazed at the questions he asked.  Do I believe it...? Hard to put down was started period.
0761171703|5.0|it is incredible how dancers can express emotions in movements and even more incredible how author catch every second off  lifetime changes.<br /><br />amazing book as a gift for people who you want bring positive emotions to and who understand the value of it.<br />good book to keep for yourself....
B000F8O35U|3.0|I ordered this DVD and for whatever reason it didnt work with OUR DVD player. I tried two different DVD players and the movie froze & skipped both times. Other than that, I recieved the DVD in a timely manner, the product arrived as described by seller and I had no problems returning the item!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|this is a very handy app, and will be helpful with I have the Fire 8.9 HD to take photos with!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I played the free version a while ago and I loved the graphics and storyline. Definitely one of the better hidden object/adventure games released by this company. But then when I went back a little while later, the price to unlock the game went up 2 dollars! I did like this game but it's not worth 5 bucks I'm sorry,it's just way too short. Why did the price change?
B00243FQFA|5.0|Culmination and unfortunately the last season.  Great ending.  Threw in some curve balls.  Significantly more action compared to the last 4 seasons.  Mikey dies, Ronan dies, but comes back.  McKay hooks up.  Teyla's baby grows.  Todd is in alot more episodes.  This does complete the series.  Still doesn't answer alot of questions, but the stories were never dull or boring.  There were so many different avenues, just like SG-1 could have taken, but in the end. . .one of the better closing finales.
0385535147|5.0|Another brilliantly written book, I was hooked from page one, and as always when it came to the end... A fantastic twist!
B00A85EMVK|5.0|IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE WHEN MADE IN 2D, BUT 3D REALLY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE. IT WAS WELL DONE MAKING IT TO 3D.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|What shines above all is the MUSIC! This was a difficult film to make - so many expectations, and yes, I agree that while Russell Crowe is a great actor, his singing did not convey the whole of Javert's character. Will still get the movie, but now I am eager to see the live play!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is not a book, it's a journey of Hope.  A journey through every emotion possible to the Sky and back.  So masterfully worded you forget about all reality. So, don't start reading it if you have any plans whatsoever, like sleeping, working, or eating......
B00005JKGO|3.0|I have nothing to say as it is a gift for my brother in law for his birthday.  nothing else

B004LWZWGA|5.0|Whats to say it is a new DVD of the dark knight . Very good movie and was shipped very fast.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|DO NOT watch the movie until you read this... Then watch the movie that takes on a life of it's own and you will come to two conclusions...<br /><br />First, It's a damn good story... no matter who tells it.<br /><br />Second, Jennifer Lawrence is a damn good actress who stole the show.
1250012570|5.0|I have no words that will do this book justice. This book is perfect in every way, from the imperfect and fractured characters, the 1986 setting, the mixtapes, walkmans, and lack of mobiles, to the raw emotional journey it took us through Eleanor and Park; two teenagers who can't seem to find a place that they belong to, an identity they could proudly call their own, a &#34;someone&#34; they could turn to for help, for love, for friendship.. until they met each other. This book is so powerful. I read it in a couple of hours and I couldn't put it down. The two POVs, switching between Eleanor and Park, gave the readers more insight on what each side is feeling, thinking, and wishing. Something we don't usually witness. These characters were layered, had flaws, faults, and a history that would bring the readers emotional pain, allow them to connect with the characters, and root for them to get together, stay together, and be whoever they wanted and needed to be.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell's gift in writing should not be overlooked. She was able to create such an eloquent novel from a simple setting, Eleanor and Park sitting in the bus on the same chair. That is how they met, that is when we see them together for over 100 pages.. they barely talk, they barely communicate, heck, Eleanor calls him &#34;the stupid asian kid&#34; while Park is just trying to pretend she doesn't exist. Eleanor isn't the stick thin girl, no she is not obese, but she still has baby fat and people make fun of her, for that and her outrageous sense of style and bright red hair. They call her &#34;Big Red&#34;. However Eleanor ignores them, for the most part, and tries to not let them get to her. However after she and Park started talking, communicating, and getting to know each other, the bullying took a step back. Yes bullying was still a part of the novel, but me as a reader lived for the moments that Eleanor & Park met because I believed they were the most gratingly honest and through them you just couldn't help but fall in love with them.<br /><br />The story is more than a love story, it also includes an abusive relationship, Eleanor's mother and her step father; How I loathed him. I also did not have any happy thoughts towards Eleanor's mother. She has 4 small children, excluding Eleanor, and she still stays in that abusive relationship, stays with the man that kicked Eleanor out of the house for a full year. There is honestly so much family issues and all of them are so realistic which is why they all hit me hard, because many people suffer from being tied to such abusive relationships, and children being the helpless victims to that. I have to say though, I loved Park's family, he is half korean, and his dad loves his mom, so glaringly obvious that it really gives the readers a clear contrast between both families. I would have to say that every single young adult reader must pick this book. Whether they enjoy contemporary or not, this book is not one to miss. I am definitely going to be getting and cherishing a copy when it is out. Rowell, you officially made me a die hard fan.just couldn't help but fall in love with them.<br /><br />The story is more than a love story, it also includes an abusive relationship, Eleanor's mother and her step father; How I loathed him.

B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The little sock-puppet skit that Seth MacFarland did for the Oscars was sooo much better than the actual movie. The movie dragged on and was so awful that I kept asking my husband if he really wanted to finish it. It was simply painful to watch Denzel Washington continue to fall off the wagon and not get any help, meanwhile his heroine junkie white trash girlfriend has no problem with recovery? I'm sorry, but I think not. Totally unrealistic and so far from \\"powerful\\" I can't imagine who was paid to say that in the first place.

0393088731|5.0|One of the best books this author has written, it is remarkable in scope, humor, depth of character, the ability to emit the most genuinely skin-crawlyingly disturbing scenes, followed by some of the funniest -- and always written with the unflinching respect of truth.  I don't understand how he does it, but as busy as I am, I read this 500-plus page book at every possible free moment, sad now that it's over.  And don't be put off by it's overly grim cover -- sorry publisher, but it just doesn't fit the book, in my opinion.<br />Just as with his other books, Welsh writes with phoenetically-accurate dialogue -- it takes some time to get used to it, and I recommend your first read be a good 50 pages to get the flow of the writing in your head.  In Skagboys he does something even more remarkable, which is to write his different characters with appropriately different accents, reflecting their origin and place in life. I found I carried their voices around in my head during the days of reading Skagboys.<br />I have listened to interviews with Welsh and it is clear, as I have often heard said, that he is a genuinely decent and incredibly nice guy.  Somehow that makes reading him even more pleasurable, for this reader anyway.<br />Do yourself a favor, and read this book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I was not expecting the turn of events about 3 quarters thru the book.  There was action thru out the book and it was again \\"a Great Vince Flynn\\" story with all of the adjectives and adverbs to make the story real and complete.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|This has been one of the best ... if not the best ... book I have read. I am not big on fantasy stories in general, but Wise Man's Fear and the Name of the Wind are fantastic. The story flow is smooth and rich and funny. Funny in a cleverly humorous way that leaves a lot for the reader to realize and imagine - and somewhere in the story Mr. Rothfuss even states with the help of the characters that a joke is not a joke if you have to explain it. The fantasy elements in the books are innovative, smart and so cleverly fabricated that you can almost think they could exist. They are close enough to real world to not irritate or seem way too far-fetched, but give a nice fairy tale element to book. However, even with the little pieces of magic and adventure and cool story, the main take-away from the books is the various descriptions of human character and relationships between people - those make you reflect your own life and attitude towards others, think what is important in life. The books touch many aspects of friendship, dealing with other cultures, internal courage, confidence and insecurity, love, desire to learn, persistence ... the story of Kvothe captivates and when reading, I couldn't wait to see where the next twist in plot will take him and how his character develops towards the wise, heroic, in-peace-with-world, confident character he is described to be in the very beginning, when Kvother starts to tell his story.  Amazing, clever and most entertaining.

Still can't say I wouldn't refer this to the right intellect.

0307454894|4.0|As usual in most instances, the book &#34;The Reader&#34; was better than the film. The book is well written and, most importantly, delves into the minds and thoughts of the characters, leading to an in-depth understanding of each, his/her motives, feelings, etc., which the movie screen is unable to portray.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|it was very scary to see what it could be like if there were a nuclear<br />showdown that came down to us and another country. I MADE MY LIST!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I didn’t quite know what to expect from this movie but unlike a lot of people I know, I didn’t judge Ben Affleck on this movie in relation to any of his past work. To be honest, all being said, it wouldn’t have mattered if I had because he can most certainly hold his head up high. With Affleck Having directed, produced and acted in the movie I can safely say that I don’t think he did a bad job at any one of them. Ok, so he has made a few duds in the past but let’s not forget that Affleck has also wrote or co-wrote an Oscar winning screenplay and starred in some pretty good movies too. This movie just proves that Mr Affleck does have talent no matter what his knockers say.<br /><br />The Premise<br /><br />----<br /><br />Argo is a dramatization of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of Iran at the height of the revolution. In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and a group of Americans were taken hostage. However, six of them managed to escape in the melee and made it to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador. Canada got in touch with the American President and he got in touch with the CIA. Many of the top brass could think of no way of getting the six Americans out of Iran safely without alerting the Iranians to their whereabouts. Tony Mendez devised a daring plan. He had worked many ‘exfils’ or exfiltration exercises to great success in the past, but none quite like this one.<br /><br />He came up with the idea of creating a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and then smuggling the Americans out as part of its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts, Mendez created a fake promotion for a movie that didn’t even exist, including actors, a screenplay and storyboards. Posters where even placed in an Iranian newspaper. Tony then proceeded to Iran as the movies associate producer. Tony was not only working against the clock but the six Americans did not think the plan could work and neither did Mendez’s colleagues at the CIA.<br />With his plan falling down all around him Tony decides to go for broke and tries to get the six Americans off Iranian soil. He would have to fool customs and soldiers at checkpoints and the airport and hope that his colleagues back home would back up his plan.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />----<br /><br />The direction is crisp and accomplished and not overly weighted in trying to be clever for the sake of it. There are moments when you could argue that this was the case but I think these moments work and pan out (forgive the pun). For instance, there is a steady cam shot which follows a waiter through a service hall into a kitchen that many would say he stole from Scorsese’s ‘Goodfellas’ but the shot ends on a TV set as an Iranian woman is giving a speech relevant to that part of the movie. It is poignant and the scene delivers. It is also shot really well, so who cares if Scorsese did it first? I don’t and I am a Scorsese fan; and let’s make no bones about it, hundreds of directors have stolen that shot if not outright then at least in essence. The atmosphere of the movie is spot on and you would believe it is the beginning of the eighties. The cinematography is top notch and well captured by Rodrigo Prieto and the photography is faultless. Fresh from his work on ‘Water for Elephants’ and ‘We Bought a Zoo’ he brings a neatness to the picture that is mesmerising as well as good to look at.<br /><br />So for me as a director, Affleck absolutely nailed it with this movie and he deserves every single bit of credit he gets. I felt that he almost had to apologetically receive his awards for this movie but did so in a dignified manner when inside he must have been screaming ‘Argo **** yourself’ (pun intended).<br /><br />That is actually a line from the movie and a joke between three of the central characters.<br /><br />Affleck plays Tony Mendez who wrote the book the film was based on and also contributed to the screenplay. The book was titled ‘The Master of Disguise’ and was written as Antonio J Mendez. Chris Terrio wrote the main bulk of the screenplay, using Mendez’s book for reference and it was also loosely based on Joshua Berman's article in 'Wired' magazine, which was entitled 'The Great Escape'. The story was hidden from the public under the official secrets act for years but was finally declassified and written about in nineteen ninety-seven. Mendez was given the highest accolade or award possible by the CIA, the 'Intelligence Star'. Having been awarded the star in nineteen eighty-one, he was unable to receive it properly until the declassification in nineteen ninety-seven.Affleck plays the role of Mendez with an almost stoic rigidity. He is missing his son in the movie and the chance that he may not make it out of the situation alive is always hanging over the character. Many will quip at my comment and say that he is always rigid but I think he portrays Mendez perfectly and let’s not forget that he is also directing this movie as well.<br /><br />Jon Goodman and Allan Arkin play great parts in the movie and Arkin is his usual sarcastic character, who is almost belligerent in his fight against the suits. He plays Lester Seigel, an actor, who along with Goodman’s John Chambers, a movie make-up artist, agrees to fake the movie for Mendez. These three come up with the line ‘Argo **** yourself’ and use it whenever they get the chance. One of my favourite scenes in the movie is near the end when Lester turns to John and says….<br /><br />Lester Siegel: The saying goes, &#34;What starts in farce ends in tragedy.&#34;<br /><br />John Chambers: No, it's the other way around.<br />Lester Siegel: Who said that exactly?<br /><br />John Chambers: Marx.<br />Lester Siegel: Groucho said that?<br /><br />The principle cast or shall we say the six hostages and the two Canadian’s and their maid, who shelter them from the Iranians are all good in their prospective roles. All the acting is believable and the, at times, almost documentary type feel adds even more to the realism.<br /><br />It is quite ironic that you get the feeling that here is Affleck, possibly filming in Iran and having to ask permission to film about a guy who has to ask permission to film a movie in Iran. We all know that that is not true though as filming in Iran would cause problems that they could probably make a movie out of; after asking for permission of course. The movie was filmed on location in California but they did manage to shoot Affleck’s visit to Istanbul in Turkey itself.<br /><br />The movie worked so well for me. A lot of people will say the first hour is slow but for me, it is one of those movies that you have to pay attention to and take in every word to get it. The last 45 minutes of the movie is superb and real edge of your seat stuff. I found it captivating and knowing that it is a true story and that it really happened makes it even more remarkable.<br />The title 'Argo' is said to allude to Jason and his ship the Argo who went in search of the golden fleece against insurmountable odds. Most of you will know of the story, either through Greek mythology or from the movie 'Jason and the Argonauts'.<br /><br />The end credits are quite poignant in the fact that the real fake passports that were used for the six Americans are shown alongside each of the actors who played the part. It is amazing how similar they look and kudos should go to the make-up and wardrobe departments for that. Then we are shown many scenes from the movie alongside actual photographs and newspaper stills that they depicted.<br /><br />Due to the nature of the fake movie within the film being a science fiction movie there are a lot of references to movies from that genre. These include ‘Star Trek’, ‘Battlestar Galactica’, ‘Planet of the Apes’,‘Doctor Strange’ and ‘The Valley of Gwanji’.<br /><br />The soundtrack is a mix of Iranian music and music that you would expect from the early eighties in America at that time. ‘March to the Dead City’ from ‘Battle For the Planet of the Apes’ from nineteen seventy-three is included. The Rolling Stones, Dire Straits and Van Halen make an appearance as does ‘Concrete Jungle’ by The Specials. ‘’Abwoon Call to Prayer’’ by Jahanara Laura Mangus , &#34;Al Adhan&#34; by Pat Jabbar, &#34;Hace Tuto Guagua&#34; by Tato Gomez and &#34;Adhan - Call to Prayer&#34; by Shaam make for a haunting back drop.<br /><br />The movie was also known as ‘Escape From Tehran’ in the US (Working Title) and as ‘Operation Argo’ in Denmark, Poland, Norway and Turkey.<br /><br />Its budget was forty-four million dollars and to date it has grossed about one hundred and forty and is well on the way to quadrupling its expenditure. The DVD sales will make it an even further success.<br /><br />It was made at Warner Bros Pictures and runs for exactly two hours. The extended version runs for an extra ten minutes and will be made available on a special edition DVD and on Blue-ray.<br /><br />George Clooney, David Klawans and Grant Heslov initially put the idea together before getting Ben Affleck to sign up as director. Alan Arkin was the first actor to be approached to star in the movie. Arkin would be nominated for an Oscar and a British Academy award for best supporting actor, although he would not be a winner. The movie did however win Oscars for the best picture, best screenplay and best editing by William Goldberg. It also won best editing, best film and Best director for Affleck at the British Academy Awards. So by definition, you could say the movie was a tad successful.<br /><br />It was widely argued (mostly by Canadians) that the movie put too much emphasis on the CIA in the rescue of the six Americans and by doing so belittled the Canadians role in the operation. I think this is a ludicrous view to take as in the first place it was Mendez who dreamed this up and put it into place with the Canadian governments co-operation. Canada came out of the whole thing with glowing reports when it was declassified and the Americans took a back seat and let them basque in the glory as they were just happy that their people were safe. It is very rare that you can say the Americans took a back seat in anything but on this occasion I thought they gave great credit to the Canadians for their part in the rescue. They did indeed give refuge and a hideaway to the six Americans but it was Mendez who risked everything to get them out.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think it is a shame that it will be lost on some without them really giving it a chance. It will also be passed over by the Affleck ‘hate brigade’ without giving it much thought. All I can say to those people is that jealousy is an awful trait to own.<br /><br />I think Affleck did a wonderful job on this intelligent and engaging movie and I salute him for his great effort. I hope he continues to direct as well as act because I think he will make some damn fine movies if Argo is anything to go by.<br /><br />A massive thumbs up from me and I give it five out of five stars. I would recommend it to anyone who likes an intelligent movie with a little edge to it.<br /><br />©Lee Billingham

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book takes place in the Irish countryside, has great character development, and yet has a very disturbing back story of hardship and heartache for an orphaned boy in the 40's. It's Charles Dickens meets James Herriot's relatives in Ireland. The ending is far from what is anticipated.

B009FZHYKU|2.0|In a lot of ways this is just starting to feel kinda tired as they grapple for more and more outrageous plot lines... and at the end of it I am just starting to not care about the characters any more... kinda hoping to see them get eaten.

B0085TKAW6|5.0|After having read 'Fall of Giants' I couldn't wait to get my hands on this sequel. With kindle, this is fortunately no problem. I downloaded it late in the evening and then 2AM had to force myself to put it aside!<br />These were my first two Ken Follett books and I can certainly understand why he's such a successful author. Both books were extremely well researched. But more importantly Follett weaves this account of history into the private lives of a cast of characters that are at once credible and diverse. He's constructed a bridge between the 'Big' historical events of the 20th century and how these affected and changed the way we live.<br />It's a real page turner and the first night wasn't my only late night ... until the book came to an end.<br />Now I'll have to wait for the last book in the trilogy which is unfortunately not coming out until late December 2014. But for a book that's so well researched and has these fascinating plots all interwoven with each other, I'll gladly wait!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This is a book that started a little slow and then took off. Haven't read a book this good in years. Will definitely be looking up more of this author. Awesome book. Can't say more or I will ruin it. Buy it, you won't regret it.

I did use the hint button but there is a map if you need it. Lot of play time. Down load wasn't a problem & expected it to take longer than it did. I hope you enjoy it. I went in knowing these games cost money & got my moneys worth & more. Dive into a beautiful underwater adventure.

B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I love Doctor Who! Living in America I only get to see the series when a station like SyFy picks it up,so I was thrilled to be able to get this season on Kindle Fire. My favorite was the episode with Vincent Vangogh, great job making it real ;-) I need to see the first series that England first aired decades ago, because I've only seen the Doctor change his person 3 times. Each Doctor is special in his own way. Every decade the special effects get better, and the partners he travels with bring so much interest and fun to the plots. If you haven't seen this one be sure to check it out...

0385535147|4.0|There are some movies you go see knowing that they will never win an Oscar but they are pure popcorn entertainment.  That's what this book is like.  It's an interesting story and about halfway through it really picks up-I couldn't wait to see where the story was going.  Don't expect deep thoughts here but it would be a great beach/vacation read.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I used to play the video game on the Sega Genesis and SNES and it always made me want to watch this movie.  On bluray it looks awesome!
B000FT69X8|5.0|THIS is why I am so, so glad that I have a Region-Free Blu Ray- DVD Player, so that I can take advantage of Notable Favorite Movies that I have seen in the Theater, when it first came out, and then rented, and then....... lost track of One that I ALWAYS meant to get. Well, NOW I Have &#34;her&#34;, and I watched her tonight on my Region Free Australian Import DVD, and once AGAIN.......<br /><br />I was transported back to when I first saw Roman Polanski's Very Faithful, and Majestic, Interpretation of Thomas Hardy's Novel of &#34;Tess of the d'Ubervilles&#34;; which is a particular Favorite of mine of all of Thomas Hardy's Novels, and most of them have ALL been made into theatrical films, ( &#34;Jude&#34; from Thomas Hardy's &#34;Jude, the Obscure&#34;, &#34;The Mayor of Castor Bridge&#34;, &#34;The Return of the Native&#34;, etc...) and if not Full-Blown Theatricals, then they ALWAYS get the &#34;Masterpiece Theater Treatment&#34; which is something that I Very Much relish as well. ) And, this one did too, I might add.<br /><br />At any rate, Roman Polanski's &#34;Tess' is so visually striking, and sumptuous, it is breath-taking! He does EXACTLY what a truly great director should do with literary masterpieces, stay true to the book, and let the adaptation of the book, and the cinematography, and of course, the actors and actresses do their very best work. Stay on the Target of the faithful Book Adaptation, but focus on the story-telling, let the Story unwind with all the power of the visuals, and the power of the interpretation of the Director, and that of the Actors/ Actresses, and let them do their best to remain faithful to the Book as well.<br /><br />Roman Polanski manages, once again, to pull this delicate balance off with spectacular success! Thomas Hardy would be very Proud of this cinematic Masterpiece of his beautifully-wrought Tragedy; and it is, and at the end of this very long, but very essential part of the story-telling, ( it is a long movie, at 165 minutes ) but it is necessary to give the film it's &#34;head&#34; to lead to it's very sad, but very real, end.<br /><br />It deserves it's 5-star Rating, and &#34;Tess&#34; won three Academy Awards, in 1979, for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Costume Design, and it's sad that the Very Young, Nastassja Kinski, didn't win for Best Actress that year. Obviously, I Very Highly Recommend this Movie, it's a Must-see! ( and a &#34;Must Get&#34;, too! IMHO )<br /><br />LynnLuv59minutes ) but it is necessary to give the film it's &#34;head&#34; to lead to it's very sad, but very real, end.<br /><br />It deserves it's 5-star Rating, and &#34;Tess&#34; won three Academy Awards, in 1979, for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Costume Design, and it's sad that the Very Young, Nastassja Kinski, didn't win for Best Actress that year.

B005J2UM9S|4.0|I am a horror movie fan. I constantly browse Prime or other avenues for new and interesting films. Most of the time, as we all know, it's a little disappointing. Although horror is perhaps my favorite genre, it is riddled with horrible films. So, I went into Grave Encounters with my usual low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that this was a well-done movie with some genuinely creepy moments, some really freaky ghosts, and a nice job at building up the tension.<br /><br />From the typical happy-go-lucky group of young adults going to look for ghosts, to some slightly disturbing moving furniture and hair flicking, all the way to some truly disturbing downright scary as hell demons and freakish monstrosities, there's a progression here that I did not expect. The effects are convincing. The 'monsters' are shown clearly which I appreciate, but are not over-the-top and do not feel like cheap CG.<br /><br />This film reminded me alot of Blair Witch, which is an excellent film in my opinion. Although I would give the nod to that film for it's innovation at the time, I would say that Grave Encounters is even more well-done, although perhaps derivative. The end scene was actually quite horrific. One thing I can say, I'll be thinking about this movie anytime I consider spending the night in a 'haunted place'.<br /><br />If you enjoy horror films, especially those that rely on tension rather than gore, check this one out. I think you'll be happy you gave it a chance.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game really surprised me on how cheap the items were. As long as you know how to them. Here's a helpful tip for this game: when you get money, spend it on buildings that produce money.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Even though I was not familiar with Ender's game books I found this book fascinating. It reminded me somehow Isaac Asimov's stories. Read it in a week.

B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Clifford J. Harris Jr. is at it again! For his real fans this is nothing new, he's been doing this since I'm Serious 2001-02. My favorite songs are I'm Sorry featuring Andre Benjamin, G Season featuring Robert Williams, Go Get It, Ball featuring Dewayne Carter, Addresses, and Who Want Some. The song Sorry gives a lot of insight into why Clifford & Andre are the way that they are, &#34; You can't please everybody&#34;. So why try, be yourself and deal with the consequences as they come!
B000YH6YG8|4.0|This movie definitely explored the effects of racism. It also gave a good analysis of karma and how wrongdoings can lead to terrible things.
