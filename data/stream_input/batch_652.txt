B0009UVBQI|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle is a brilliant parody of western themes and mindblowing Kung Fu action from start to finish. Several viewings are required to digest all the action and symbolism. The ambiance made me feel like i was in China again, as the tenement house is realistic and authentic (designed by Stephen Chow) plus the music score is of traditional Chinese opera orchestra. Choreography, sets, costumes and colors are magnificent! An unforgettable comedy. The special features are fun and Ric Meyers did a great one on one interview with Stephen Chow, (this is his Masterpiece). You will not believe this (i didn't at first), but this a spiritual movie at a high level.  Chow played the bad guy, but later in the movie, found enlightenment. Enjoy!
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|this band and every other \\"emo\\"  to recently make it big are a joke. this is terrible music just part of another scene people will be laughing at in 10 years. the music is filled with false feeling and attempts to evoke emotion. this is just the standard hot topic band along with thje other thousadns of bands that sound just like it. if you really wanna hear a ban d thats really meaning full and emotional check out the birthday party.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Best album yet. Since I have bought it, I have listened to it non-stop. It is very soothing. If you are having a bad day, listen to this, it gets right under your skin in a good way, and mellows you out. Keep bringing on the music, John!!!
B00011RPB0|4.0|I wasn't thrilled with this film when I saw it a few years ago in the theater but after watching it again I found it to be very amusing and entertaining. Murray and Johansson have good on screen chemistry and the situations and settings they are sharing in Tokoyo offer great context for their reactions. Murray actually gives a very understated performance.<br /><br />A side effect of viewing this is to have a sudden urge to travel to Japan and see for oneself. Pretty cool concept for a movie and well executed.
B00005JPAM|3.0|I think one's enjoyment of the film is tied in with  how much one is enthralled by British Monarchy. Lovers of Diana and English Monarchy will be enthralled by The Queen while those who aren't will be weary. Helen Mirran does gives a very detailed  and insightful performance (she is touted to win the oscar) and James Cromwell is uncanny look alike for Prince Phillip.  But overall, the movies lacks heart; just like the Queen herself. And I guess, as a  movie watcher I find it hard to care about a character who lacks heart.
B0002I831S|5.0|I sometimes think there are three stages in the life of a Star Trek viewer.  As a child, you're fascinated with all the neat monsters and lasers, especially if you grew up when the show was first in syndication and there was little like it.  When you're in your late teens or twenties, you become more jaded, realizing the effects are rather crude and the acting a bit hammy (or for a minority, you go in the opposite direction and become a die-hard Trekkie).  Finally, you get a little older and you learn to look beyond the faults and re-realize just how fun the show was. <br /> <br />The Complete First Season of Star Trek features 29 episodes plus a few bonus features.  For me, many of the episodes were vaguely familiar, even if they hadn't been seen in twenty years or more; others seemed completely new.  Although not presented in original broadcast order, they generally move from the beginning to the end of the season.   <br /> <br />Of course, the central character in the series is William Shatner's Captain James Kirk, but almost as important are the half-Vulcan, Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and DeForrest Kelley's Dr. \\"Bones\\" McCoy.  These two act as rivals for Kirk's ear, the former representing the coldly logical approach to problems and the latter the more irrational humanistic approach.  In the end, Kirk is the one making the choice, however.  Other series characters are rather minor, even if they recur. Uhura, Sulu and Scotty only rarely add much to any story. <br /> <br />Not every story is fantastic, and 29 is too many to individually review, but I will comment on a couple.  The Corbomite Maneuver shows Kirk at his best, taking on a vastly more powerful alien with little more than his wits.  The Galileo Seven features Spock in a key role as he tries to save a shipwrecked crew and realizes that hard choices will need to be made if any are to survive.  Shore Leave and Mudd's Women are a bit on the lighter side, but they never get completely silly.  And The City onthe Edge of Forever - considered by many (including myself) as the best episode of the whole series - gives Kirk his greatest moral dilemma. <br /> <br />Not every episode is good.  Errand of Mercy and A Taste of Armageddon both are a little over-the-top in their anti-war messages.  Miri suffers from both bad child actors and a huge plot hole:  the story takes place on a planet identical to Earth, but there is no reason why this should be the case.  Most episodes are good or great, however, and even these weak ones are still fun to watch.  In the end, you have to also take these episodes in the context of their time, and in this sense, the show was far above any other science-fiction show out there.  So if you're past that second stage of a Star Trek viewer's life, and you can look beyond the faults, this is well-worth watching. <br />
B000LC4CVA|4.0|Only disappointment is that they have not included the option of English subtitles for the words of some songs that are difficult to hear.  I believe this would have added significantly to the enjoyment of the concert.  Overall, however, a great follow-up to \\"River Dance.\\"
1594481938|5.0|If you're sick of life and on the roof of a tall building, there are two ways down.  The short way down is over the edge:  a few seconds and it's all over.  The long way down is by the stairs or elevator and back into the living world; it's the harder way, but for many, it will also be the better way.  A Long Way Down is the title of Nick Hornby's book and the journey of its four principal characters. <br /> <br />The first of these four is Martin, a former morning talk-show host who, through a series of bad decisions (most notably, sleeping with a fifteen year old girl) has lost his family and his nice job.  Martin goes to the top of a tall building on New Year's Eve with the intent of killing himself.  Fortunately (or maybe unfortunately), this particular building is a popular spot for jumpers and New Year's Eve is a popular time for suicide.  Hence, he will soon not be alone. <br /> <br />Maureen is a middle-aged woman saddled with a son who is in a persistent vegetative state.  Although generally a good Catholic who considers suicide a sin, she is worn out by the burden of her son and the guilt over considering him a burden.  Jess is a girl in her late teens who may be crazy but at the very least has attention-deficit disorder; obsessed over a boyfriend who dumped her, her thoughts of suicide come to her on a whim.  Finally, JJ is a former rock musician of minor note who's now a pizza delivery guy.  Dumped by both his girlfriend and his best friend/bandmate, he is now very depressed. <br /> <br />Winding up on the roof at roughly the same time, the distraction of having others around kind of ruins the moment.  None wind up taking the short way down and, despite their best efforts to deny it, a bond has formed between them.  They may not like each other, but they are now linked, and the bulk of the book deals with their misadventures as they try to decide whether their lives can be rebuilt or if suicide is still inevitable.   <br /> <br />As usual, Nick Hornby has written a top-notch novel that is both humorous and melancholy.  His writing skill shines as he has the four alternate in the narration and each has a distinct voice.  For Hornby, the story is less about happy or sad endings or any sort of ending; it is more about Martin, Maureen, Jess and JJ and how they try and bring themselves back from the brink.  In real life, conclusions are rarely clear, and Hornby knows this.  The end result is a book that is a complete pleasure to read. <br />
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|My #1 favorite JANE EYRE production has always been the Dalton version - for me, no one was better as Rochester than Dalton and I haven't changed my mind on that.  I also love the Orson Welles and George C. Scott versions.  The most horrible version of all is the one with William Hurt -- a case of very bad casting!  As much as I love Ciaran Hinds, that version was just plain awful -- all he did was run around and yell at the top of his lungs.  I have always loved Toby Stephens in everything he's done but I was very doubtful of him as Rochester and doubtful of yet another version of one of my favorite novels.  It's been done so many times and after the disappointment with the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version just a few years ago, I had no hopes at all.  Boy was I surprised!  It's not perfect and Stephens doesn't knock Dalton from his pedestal but he's a terrific #2 -- this was very good entertainment.  Lovely music and Stephens is very compelling.  Ruth Wilson is ok - she grows on you as the story progresses.  And there were some fascinating little differences - the flashback scene to Jamaica and Bertha's room being a little less dungeon-like, and the nice little ending.  I know the \\"sexing up\\" of the novel won't go down well with purists (the way the 1995 Colin Firth version of Pride & Prejudice appalled purists) but who cares?  I loved the racy scenes with Rochester and Jane - Stephens just made it deliciously steamy.  I laughed and cried at this version and will certainly buy it.
B0002CHIJW|1.0|So I decided maybe I'll give this exploitation thing a try considering I love gore,violence, and horror movies. The reason I give it a 1 star is because it just isn't that good of a movie. It's VERY boring for most of the movie. About the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said. Then the guys just rape this woman several times, then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge. It's very slow paced and doesn't live up to the hype. It isn't all that gory, and it isn't scary either. Also, the rape isn't that convincing. I'm not saying I need everything shown in detail, but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal. Oh, and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was practically mentally retarded. The guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad. That is not grounds for what she did to him, which in my opinion was the worst of the killings. Anyways. not that good of a movie, don't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|According to many sources on the internet the US DVD does not have the Special Features that the UK version has. For some reason they are distributing the DVD with all of the Special Features later in May. The US DVD reportedly only has cast filmographies and a biography of Charlotte Bronte. The UK version includes all of those above and deleted scenes, audio commentaries, interviews with cast & crew, and a photo gallery.<br /><br />If all the extras aren't important to you by all means go ahead and order this beautifully done adaption of Jane Eyre. Of course these sources could be untrue but I'd rather wait to find out then to go and buy another copy of it in May.
B000059HB7|5.0|The three parts of the title of this review illustrate the three main conflicts in this classic western. The main conflict is this: An accused criminal (Burdette) is held in jail on the orders of Sheriff Chance (John Wayne). Burdette's many friends attempt several times to spring Burdette from jail. The setting is Texas sometime after the Alamo, and there is a significant Hispanic flavor in this western.<br /><br />The following information is provided for those viewers concerned about the levels of violence in films. This western includes a great deal of shooting, and there are actual scenes of people dead and dying of gunshot wounds. In addition, dynamite is used as a weapon.<br /><br />Dude, an under-sheriff of sorts, had experienced personal tragedies in the recent past, and became a hard-core alcoholic. Burdette's men refer to him with contempt, calling him as a barfly. Throughout this flick, Dude tries to free himself from the bottle. A number of scenes show him trembling from withdrawal symptoms (d. t., delirium tremens). At one point, his hands become so unsteady from the d. t. that he wants to quit his job. In spite of his best efforts, he is about to drink again. But he pours the alcohol back into the bottle, demonstrating at this point both his mastery over alcoholism and the renewed steadiness of his hands, indicative of the passing of his d. t. But the conflict continues. Alcoholism is so insidious. Is Dude actually victorious over his alcoholism, or will he break down and drink again? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.<br /><br />Stumpy, another under-sheriff of sorts, is assigned to guard the jail. Sheriff Chance does not want Stumpy engaged in gunfights because the latter walks with a limp, and would probably be a liability in a gunfight. But Stumpy resents his subsidiary role, and longs for the action. Will Stumpy remain relegated to the sidelines, or will he see a part of the action? See the film.<br /><br />Burdette's friends resort to several ploys in order to free Burdette from jail. At one point, they capture Dude and use him as a hostage. They want to exchange him for Burdette. Sheriff Chance, having other ideas, agrees to this exchange. Will Dude be safely returned? And will Burdette go free? Again, I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.sort to several ploys in order to free Burdette from jail. At one point, they capture Dude and use him as a hostage.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I had only seen one other Jane Eyre (the George C. Scott and Susannah York version of the early 1970's), and I had read the book many years ago.  After the first episode of this one, I began reading the book again and looked forward all week to the second installment.  To all those saying it doesn't follow the book, I think it sticks quite well to the plot, and in only four hours time it would be impossible to include every long speech that the characters make.  I thought the acting and chemistry between the main characters was amazing.  I could actually see why Jane would fall in love with Rochester. (And no, it's not just because Toby Stephens is good looking!)   The music, the quality of production, everything  was first rate.  I'll definitely be watching it more than once!
0393327655|5.0|A much needed dose of secular argument to combat the irrationality and dogmatism creeping into political life. Enlightened politicians can still be found willing to speak out on society's ills but they are being effectively muzzled when the ills impinge upon what are increasingly regarded as religious areas, stem cell culture, abortion et al. Harris' attack on moral equivalence is particularly relevant in Australia's policy of multiculterism where all religions are considered equally acceptable without question.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Chameleon, charlatan, poseur, genius, prolific, derivative, alt-country poster boy, drunken fool and careerist, these and many more titles have been foisted upon singer songwriter Ryan Adams.  The amazing thing is that most carry quite a bit of truth!  Adams does so many things to engage, or enrage music fans, that he is fast approaching Dylan's level of being an enigmatic artist.<br /><br />Say what you will about his past work, COLD ROSES is by far his best outing to date.  With the luxury of the best backing band of his career, The Cardinals, Adams comes up with a solid set of tunes that stray into Deadhead territory.  The album visits the spirit of Garcia, Lesh, Weir and Company's highwater marks, AMERICAN BEAUTY and WORKINGMAN'S DEAD, with surprisingly good results.<br /><br />Highlights are many, including DANCE ALL NIGHT, CHERRY LANE, MAGNOLIA MOUNTAIN, EASY PLATEAU and LET IT RIDE.  For an artist who throws out a ton of material, often without an eye towards overall quality, this one is very consistent.  The only weak moment that I can spot is the irritating, faux NY Dolls intro to the otherwise solid BEAUTIFUL SORTA.  That he was able to follow this up with two solid albums (29 and JACKSONVILLE CITY NIGHTS) in the same year is amazing.<br /><br />I would not go as far as saying that COLD ROSES is a classic, but to my ears, it's the first time that Adams has hit one out of the park. Yes, it's derivative, but overall it's a well played and written set, that shows potential turning into results.  I hope that it's a sign of things to come.
B000K4WPCC|1.0|I went to see this movie without having heard anything about it beforehand. In the first scene I was expecting it to be a horror movie. It isn't that. I'm not exactly sure what it is. The words that come to mind are \\"ridiculous\\" \\"far-fetched\\" \\"poorly acted\\" and \\"stupid plotline.\\" This movie is all a mimic of a whimsical, enchanting idea that was horrible scripted and portrayed. The actors are unbelieveable and are terrible actors. Especially the antagonist.<br /><br />Only see this if you are with a group of friends who have a good sense of humor. This is not to be watched seriously. Make fun of it brutally for me please.
B00004TX5F|5.0|I love this film and have watched it many times. The richness of the world of 18th century music is wonderfully done, the singing is breathtakingly gorgeous, but best of all is the complex portrayal of the young castrato Farinelli (whose real name was Carlo Broschi) in all his brilliance, moodiness, exhausting and exacting art, his lovingness and artistic arrogance, wit, tenderness and deep sadness....and his amazing relationship with his brother Riccardo, a mediocre composer who has given his life in service to Carlo's gift and also taken Carlo's life by having him secretly castrated as a child so that his boyhood soprano voice might always sing Riccardo's music...something that Carlo does not know but will learn in the course of the film.<br /><br />I am myself a historical novelist (MARRYING MOZART from Viking Penguin) and the question is always present for me of how far historical fact should be nudged for the sake of drama. Certainly in my studies of Mozart for my book, I thought many times of how, in the movie AMADEUS, the character of Salieri was badly maligned and worse, the character of Mozart himself was presented as a foul-mouthed child, taking a very small part of Mozart's real behavior (a handful of youthful smutty letters to a cousin) and making it the measure of the man!<br /><br />So saying, I wish the writer/director of FARINELLI had not made Handel such a cruel, insensitive pig. Handel is so gratuitously insulting to the young Farinelli when they first meet, so taunting and disdainful when Farinelli is nothing but polite, that when Farinelli spits in Handel's face, the viewer wishes he'd done much more. This is no way to recruit a young genius singer to come work for you! Each time we see Handel in the movie he gets crueler until at the end he is seen having some sort of physical collapse when he hears Farinelli sing Handel's great opera \\"Rinaldo\\" with great beauty...and vows never to write opera again! Oh, why was the composer of \\"The Messiah\\" portrayed as such a horror?<br /><br />Farinelli's seduction of women was also a bit overdone. However, when his brother comes in to make such seductions a m&eacute;nage &aacute; trois, Stefano Dionisi's Farinelli is brilliant...he looks exhausted, bewildered, wistful, as if wondering how he ever got into such an arrangement and what he is doing there and what his place is indeed off the stage, being as he is, a man who is idolized for his singing voice and at the same time mocked for the lack of procreative powers which has made that glorious voice possible.<br /><br />Yet even with these things said, I would give it six stars if I could! Oh what a portrait it is of an artist made an idol against his will and the relationship of brothers, so grievous when broken, so difficult to mend!portrayed as such a horror? <br /> <br />Farinelli's seduction of women was also a bit overdone.

0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" is foremost the story of a shipwrecked boy and the zoo animals that find their way onto his life raft. It is also a fascinating, if mostly incredible, tale of spiritual development. And there is a third story at the end, which I won't spoil--I will only say that I found it to be at once tragic and hopeful.    Before I read the book, I had been told by a number of people that it was a profoundly spiritual work. Even the book itself claims that it will \\"make you believe in God.\\" I, however, apparently \\"missed the boat\\" by making my peace with God before I cracked the cover of \\"Life of Pi.\\" All in all, this book did not alter my life in any kind of radical way, though it was certainly a pleasure to read.    As much as I enjoyed sharing in Pi's odyssey, there were still some aspects of Martel's writing that frustrated me. The almost schizophrenic religious identity of the protagonist is as unrealistic as it is intriguing, and in many ways this applies to the whole story: it is \\"intriguingly unrealistic.\\" This is especially true during what I can only think to describe as the \\"mystical island hallucination,\\" the significance of which I admit was lost on me. If you can swallow a healthy dose of the fanciful you might enjoy this book; if your thing is concrete plotting, in which everything is what it seems, it's probably best to steer clear of this one.    A parting caveat: \\"Life of Pi\\" is a very different book than its publicity suggests. Though its protagonist is a child, it is definitely not a \\"children's book.\\" In fact, it is one of the more gruesomely violent works of fiction I have read. This is not a criticism, just a warning to unsuspecting readers. If you can stomach the gore, though, finishing Martel's book is overall a worthwhile endeavor.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie is the best movie I've seen in years.  At the end I was laughing through my tears.  There's only one other movie that did that to me and it was \\"Steel Magnolias\\".  Each character was frighteningly real.  When I showed my husband the movie, he said, \\"Oh, brother---this looks like a real dud.\\"  (He says that about most movies I choose---and he's always wrong!)  But at the end, he said, \\"Marion, you did it again because this one is a real keeper!\\"<br /><br />My husband and I owned that van (in another form) in the 1970's and we really did have to park it on a hill to push-start it due to a bad transmission and no $$$ to fix it.  In fact, I was in labor with my first child and I had still not learned the art of \\"popping\\" the clutch to start the van.  So I had to push the van while in labor so my husband could start it.  We still laugh about that.  And what was even funnier was when my husband went to take my mother home from the hospital (she doesn't drive) he had to get HER to push it.  LOL!  Perhaps that helped make the movie more poignant & hilarious for me.  (And the yellow VW van was literally a character in the film!)  STILL, it was awesome.<br /><br />It was SO amazing I bought the freaking movie and the last time I bought a movie was \\"Kill Bill 1 & 2\\" (the ultimate chick flicks of all time, bar none!)  I also bought the soundtrack to \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" which is fabulous.<br /><br />So if you want to see a movie that will make you laugh, think, and yes, cry, then get this movie.  It's a classic, for sure!!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I bought this DVD for Christmas & watched it again last night - more than a decade after I had packed away my old video. It is just as wonderful as I remembered and certainly remains one of my all-time favourite films. At the risk of sounding repetitious after the 281 other reviewers I will explain why.  <br /> <br />Dirty Dancing is set in a summer resort in the Catskills in 1963, a gentler, simpler time when the world (or at least the North American middle class part of it) was innocent and naïve & hovered on the cusp of vast social change. It was before the Kennedy assassination & the morass of Viet Nam, before student riots and feminism and The Pill, before the Beatles, and just as Motown music was hitting our consiousness.  <br />In 1963 swear words did not appear in print, let alone on TV. Movies and books told a story with a \\"moral\\". The good guys always won & the bad guys got their just desserts. Pregnancy out of wedlock was the greatest disaster that could befall a young girl, usually solved by her family sending her \\"to visit an aunt\\" out of state for a year, putting the baby up for adoption & drawing a veil of silence over the episode. (This actually happened to a school acquaintance of mine in 1963: everyone knew, but it was never, I repeat, NEVER, spoken of again).  <br /> <br />The film has a particular resonance for our generation who came of age at that time. The heroine was 17 years old in 1963, exactly my age then. I worked at a summer resort & knew someone just like Johnny Castle, played by Patrick Swayze in the film. I think most women have a Johnny Castle one summer in our youth.  <br />In 1987 it was mothers who dragged their protesting daughters to see the movie. It has spawned a host of imitators & remakes, the best of which is probably the Australian-made \\"Strictly Ballroom\\". There is also a recent remake \\"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\\", set in Cuba which has a following among a new young generation although I have not seen it. Now, a new DVD of Dirty Dancing is being issued for the children & grandchildren of the original fans.  <br />Dirty Dancing bears its age well. It is well worth seeing again, besides hearing that wonderful music that threads through the film: Cry to Me, Will You Love Me Tomorrow, In the Still of the Night, Soul Man, Hungry Eyes and the finale piece \\"I've Had the Time of My Life\\" sung by one half of the Righteous Brothers duo, the golden-voiced Bill Medley. <br />(originally submitted Jan 3,2007)

0446528056|5.0|Nicholas Sparks, whether anyone wants to believe it or not, is one of America's best storytellers.  His reputation for churning out simple yet heartwarming love stories has earned him a place in the hearts of millions of readers.  Dear John is quite possibly the best book he's written in years.<br /><br />After leading a rebellious life, John Tyree has been enlisted in the army for a couple of years now.  While he's on leave, he resides in a small town in North Carolina to visit with his distant father.  While he's on leave, however, he meets a woman named Savannah Lynn Curtis.  She's a good woman who goes to college, hoping to work with special children someday.  When they meet their friendship quickly grows into something more.  Now, realizing that his service is almost up, John feels he's ready to settle down with Savannah, and she's willing to wait for him until that time.<br /><br />When 9/11 happens, however, their plans change.  John re-enlists in the military, and Savannah has to wait longer.  But how long can Savannah wait?<br /><br />Dear John is easily one of Sparks's more endearing novels.  The story is told from John's point of view, which helps us not only to understand John, but also what he's going through.  Despite his rebellious past, John Tyree is quite a likable fellow.  He is a good man, yet flawed in some ways.  In a word, he's human.  Savannah doesn't always come across that way, and while the novel can sometimes go into the cliche territory of, \\"Girl is just too good for guy,\\" it's still rather sweet, because as the novel moves on, we begin to see her character come to life as well.<br /><br />Needless to say there are a few moments in the book that aren't always to read.  Particularly how Sparks touches on 9/11 as well as what John goes through over seas.  To some extent it's depressing, but for the most part it feels very humanistic.<br /><br />As usual, however, the story begins fairly slowly, and doesn't pick up until the halfway point.  What saves Dear John from feeling too bogged down in prose is the characters involved.  Easily, Sparks has crafted some of his most memorable characters since A Walk to Remember.<br /><br />If you enjoy character driven stories, you'll love Dear John.  It's a novel full of heart and warmth.  The most memorable book he's written in years.e halfway point.  What saves Dear John from feeling too bogged down in prose is the characters involved.

B000001GPX|5.0|Carlos Kleiber who was relatively unknown until fairly recently, has created a masterpiece. In effect he has been rediscovered. His father was no mean figure in classical music during WWII in South America and the son seems to have inherited a great deal of inspirational genius from Dad. The Viena Philharmonic is playing in its best form. This recording will outlive most others for musical excellence, precision, feeling and soul. Technically and musically, this is by far the most thrilling recording of our time. The technical sound is flawless, the inspiration is impeccable.The recording of both symphonies sustains the level of awe and excitement not usually found on most recordings of Beethoven.   Oh, dear, would that Carlos had recorded the Missa Solemnis and other iconic monuments by Beethoven.

B000F3T3CS|5.0|This DVd was laugh out loud funny.  I really can't take it when I hear people comment that Rolando Villazon is overacting.  He is not wooden or stiff -thank god.  He lets his emotion show through and he would have made a wonderful dramatic actor if God had not given him such a beautiful voice.  He is absolutely the greatest thing to come along in opera for a long,long time.  He has me listening to things I thought I never would have condeidered.  Anna Netrebko is very good too although she has a way to come with her voice and control of it.  Leo Nucci was very good although maube a little too old for this part but the scenes with him and Rolando alone are classic schtick.  I had a wonderful time and this DVD puts you in a good mood.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This movie is intense & it uses up every grains of your concentration & energy in deciphering the sum of the parts of \\"Babel\\". To me, the movie is evaluating about barrier, be it tangible & intangible. For Japanese segment of \\"Babel\\", there's a barrier between father & daughter. The daughter is deaf-mute & communication is compromised somewhat. However, the father is overcome with a sense of helplessness for not doing enough to save his wife &  perhaps his daughter, whilst the daughter is rebelling AGAINST the father because she's angry that he's becoming the way that he is. Then, the daughter herself is having problem assimmilating to society due to her apparent physical handicap. In this instance, there are already physical, emotional, language barriers to address.  For American segment, we have the young couples who goes to Morroco for time-out & it's apparent that all isn't well with their relationship. As the movie progresses, it would divulge of the reason that causes an emotional barrier to be built up between them. The tragedy that's to happen to Cate Blanchett's character would subsequently open the channel of communication which somehow enables reconciliation for them to move forward with their lives.   For Mexico's segment of the story, the babysitter of the American couple would take their children to Mexico for a wedding.  Then, everything go awry. This really brings to the fore the paranoia & the suspicion that we have towards somebody or something that we don't know of.  Humanity is eroded or degraded the moment we approach the immigration check-in and check-out points when immigration officers would dissect us without giving us benefit of a doubt & that our dignity & integrity aren't spared.  In this instance, race & borderlines are barriers that we are evaluating.  Last but not least, the Morroco segment about the two children who used the hunting gun carelessly.  There's possibly the questioning about the age barrier, of what we deem as suitable for someone to use something dangerous in a responsible manner.  The beauty of this movie is that towards the end, everyone is linked directly & indirectly.  \\"Babel\\" is an intelligent movie that raises questions about barriers & applaud it for its capacity to have us evaluating upon the topic even when the final credit rolls.  There used to be a saying that if one hundred person sneeze at one part of the world, a person would feel the breeze at the other side of the world.  Could that be Butterfly Effect?  Highly recommended and an experience not to be missed.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I don't often feel compelled to write online reviews. Having watched this DVD about 10 times and listened to the CD countless times since I purchased it (3 days ago) I felt I had to. This is an amazing concert - showcasing Madonna at her absolute peak. I had the fortune of seeing the Confessions Tour live in Amsterdam, however being quite far back from the stage and surrounded by a lacklustre audience I wanted to experience it all over again. Each track is excellent, highpoints include the stunning opener Future Lovers/I feel love, Ray of Light, Let it will be (electrifying mix and performance), Erotica (sensual and modern), La Isla Bonita (pure fun and energy) & of course Hung up. But each track has its own pleasures - notice how she reverts to her `higher pitched' early singing style for Lucky Star.  <br /> <br />A lot of care has gone into the camera work and visuals - the concert literally comes alive from your DVD. Sound quality is excellent too. My only minor gripe is the choice of songs on the CD but knowing Madonna she will probably release a live compilation in future years so is saving the best for that no doubt!  <br /> <br />And finally every respect to the lady herself - looking beautiful, fit and healthy (compared to her odd looking appearance from Drowned World tour) and singing in top form she belies the fact that she is approaching 50. Advice: DON'T grow old gracefully Madonna - and to all fans - do buy this thrilling DVD/CD combo. <br />
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Great gift for anyone who enjoys the show.  Very nice case/book that holds all of the dvd's that includes pictures and looks very elegant.  G/F loves it.
0618680004|4.0|About a hundred pages in, I was wondering why such a brilliant man was bothering to take pot shots at the unresisting imbecility that is religion.  By the end, I knew why and applauded the effort. <br /> <br />It's time we stopped letting the religious bully us all into submission. Faith is the enemy of reason and a Petrie Dish for fanaticism, fascism and fundamentalism.  More people need to say it and everyone needs to hear it. <br /> <br />Bravo.
B00005J6UP|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Almost like an Indiana Jones type movie, but with kids.  Great dvd.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|A technically masterful and profound production, this documentary overlays McNamara's stories with historic footage showing the tools and after-affects of war.  Philip Glass' background music is hypnotic.  Viewers who have seen Koyaanisqatsi will see powerful and subtle similarities in the two films in the music and in some of the photography.  At McNamara's age of 85 he is able to look back and derive powerful lessons learned.  War is totally irrational and the second lesson offered is that rational man can engage in completely irrational acts and therefore rationality will not save mankind.
B00005JO9J|5.0|If you like the medical shows on tv that include drama, medical situations, and even some humor.... then this is a great series.
0393061310|1.0|As a student of anthropology I had this book recommended to me numerous times. Everyone said that it was \\"illuminating\\" and \\"brilliant.\\" Naturally I had to check it out. What I thought would be an interesting telling of the history of humanity was more than just boring - it was infuriating in that it has received so much positve press for such a bloated piece of work!  <br /> <br />Jared Diamond is a Geographer and an Evolutionary Biologist, therefore he has authority to speak about the physical evolution of humanity, even to a certain extent about the people of the globe. That is where his academic authority ends. Unfortunately for the book, he goes on for an additional 15 chapters or so talking about cultural development. It is a big leap to make from technology development based on geographic resources to determining the order of language and tool use as signs of cultural progression. He states theories as fact without addressing the fact that there are valid opposing theories within the field.  <br /> <br />This books is 440 pages of a man exercising his ego. For an evolutionary biologist by practice, he certainly does not correct the misconceptions of the masses concerning the purpose and direction of evolution; instead he helps to reenforce them with his deterministic outlook. Perhaps the most absurd section comes from page 129, where he states that humans never domesticated acorns because we couldn't out compete the squirrels. I can honestly say that the only reason I have kept this book is in case I cannot sleep and need something to put me out quickly.
6304779356|5.0|Probably my favorite vampire movie of all time.  It's a classic.
B00005JOCU|5.0|I saw this with my sister in February her birthday. The two of us-and the audience as a whole-were simply moved and enthralled by this wonderful piece of cinematic magic.    Simply put, even if you are not familiar with the backstory that this film was based on (the Motown records backstage drama between Berry Gordy and the Supremes), the greatness of this movie is that it speaks for anyone who has been rejected for unfair reasons and who wishes to triumph against a world that seems set against them. Even though its a story about black women in the 60s and 70s, most people regardless of race, class, gender, or era can identify with this film. Like al truly good art, its universal. The songs, story, and acting all speak to this human condition in a most powerful and beautiful fashion.    Hardcore R&B fans will get some extra joy in this film by picking out who the main characters are based on. The Supremes (the DGs) and Jamie Foxx (Berry Gordy) have been discussed, but Eddie Murphy is electrifying as the James Brown/Marvin Gaye prototype James Thunder Early (those familiar with his Saturday Night Live takeoffs of JB will find extra amusement in this) and the Jackson Five sendup is quite a hoot! There are some others but I'll leave that for the viewer to see.    And of course this would not be complete without discussing Jennifer Hudson. Sistergirl had audiences giving standing-o's across the country in movie theaters. She is acclaimed (deservedly) for her perfomance of \\"And I Am Telling You\\" in this film, but the buildup that leads to this scene with the other Dreamgirls is also outstanding  and leaves you limp after Jennifer's tour de force. Beyonce is no Cicely Tyson or Diana Ross, but she makes the best of her talents in her performance of the song \\"Listen.\\" (She does clearly channel Diana during the reprise of \\"Family\\").    It is all so good and wonderful that after seeing this you'll run to church/mosque/synagogue and thank GOD for allowing Thomas Edison to invent motion pictures.    OKAY-REVIEW REMIX NOW THAT DG IS ON DVD:    All you hardcore DG junkies can THROW AWAY those bootlegs you bought from \\"Sweet Lenny\\" on the street corner with people getting up and clapping during Jenny Hudson's tour-de-force as the methodone for your DG addiction. The REAL, UNCUT STUFF is here to get your fix and here's some added comments about this product-     The 12 deleted scenes are not that revealing. Mostly added angles to what's already here. The hilarious Jackson Five takeoff is shown in its entirety. There is an amusing segment where Eddie Murphy gets into a barroom brawl with a jealous boyfriend of a female admirer. Murphy fans will note the similarity to his \\"street fight\\" routine from RAW (1987). \\"Effie Sing My Song\\" with JH and Keith Robinson is quite touching, but one can see why the producers felt it was a bit much and dropped it from the theatrical release (glad it found a place here). But its good for DG fans to see what we were missing in the theaters.    The documentary on disc II is strictly for the folks who would camp out at the store overnight to buy this on the first day. But there is some interesting stuff here. It is a bit jarring to see the DG's sans makeup au natural (and a bespectacled Anika Rose) going through rehearsals. Speaking of Anika, she appears far more mature than her screen character doing \\"Ain't No Party\\" (a song that was in the play, but not the final film).    This is my new favorite film of all time and it is of many other people too. Get it and you'll see why.
B00003CX95|5.0|If you have not seen this movie, then you are missing out.  I've seen it a few times on tv and loved it and just wanted to add the dvd to my collection.  Great action, history, war, love, etc. movie all in one.  One of my favorites.
B000INAXHE|5.0|As a previous reviewer has stated, this is JMQ's last bit with Sony.  I wish 'em all the luck in the world.  They've got to be one of the best bands on the planet!  This is a great CD set and if you're a fan, the double CD is a must!  JMQ, wherever you go, I will follow!
0375758992|5.0|I have always loved reading, but once in a while you come across a book that is so beautiful, you almost want to drink it; this is one.  I found myself desperate to pick it up and read more, at the same time pacing myself; not wanting the experience of reading it to end.  Alexandra Fuller's style is refreshingly different, and I think this book has firmly taken its place in my top three all time favourites.
B0002PUH2Y|5.0|This album is filled with powerful songs. Bebe's eclectic approach keeps it fresh and interesting.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I will say the same thing about Hail to the Thief that I said about Kid A. When some of the individual songs are left to stand alone, they easily earn five stars. When considered as an album, however, Hail to the Thief is a little choppy in places. <br /> <br />2+2=5, There There, and Go to Sleep stand out as benchmarks; songs like the Gloaming and Punchup at a Wedding, though daring and original, do not quite flow with the album as a whole. This being said, the better songs on Hail to The Thief make it a great success musically and experimentally-- but, all things considered, I don't feel it quite reached the five-star mark.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|My favorite album of all time from the most important artist of our time. Manu Chao's contributions can be likened to greats like Woodie Guthrie, Bob Dylan, and Bob Marley with a global perspective. This intoxicating collection provokes and delights providing the first great folk anthem of the century. If you don't know this artist, get to know him
0783219695|5.0|Apollo 13 is based on Based on the true story of the ill-fated 13th Apollo mission bound for the moon. Astronauts Lovell, Haise and Mattingly were scheduled to fly Apollo 14, but are moved up to 13. Swigert replaced Ken Mattingly at the last moment. It was 1970, and America has already achieved their lunar landing goal, so there's little interest in this. America had become complacent about our space shots by this time, which is something I still do not understand. But that may be because I worked so long at the Kennedy Space Center and always knew and still understand how dangerous each and every launch is. Apollo 13 was to have been the fifth mission to the moon. But two days into the trip, on April 13, 1970, the oxygen tank exploded in the command module, placing the three astronauts in grave danger. This movie shows those terrifying days as astronauts, contractors, and Mission Controlled struggled to bring Apollo 13 safely back to earth. <br /> <br />This special edition is the copy should purchase. It has two commentaries. One of the commentaries is by director Ron Howard and the other commentary by Jim and Marilyn Lovell. It also contains the IMAX version that is crisp and great if you have a home theater. You will learn that they show only a very few of the things that actually went wrong on the flight. And almost everything you see in the movie actually happened with a couple of composite characters to help the flow of the movie. From the documentary \\"Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13\\" where the crew and cast members come across as being absolutely committed to portraying events accurately, but in a way that underscored the innate drama of them. You can tell that every single person involved in this project had respect for the material and staying true to the story. A must see. <br />
0061150142|3.0|After being turned on to Jodi Picoult through My Sister's Keeper, I sought her out at the bookstore and stumbled upon this book.<br /><br />Picoult manages to capture the essence of the grief and heartache suicide bequeathes in exacting detail.  I admired the deft way in which she segued from present to past, seamlessly telling the story of a multitude of characters through varying perspectives.<br /><br />However, I think she fell short in the execution of events leading to Emily's suicide.  After the last page, I'm still left questioning how Emily was brought to believe suicide was her only option.  I think Picoult should have examined this angle a bit more in-depth.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I agree with all positive comments here! <br />O sure we all want more Madonna! who dont? and we will ignore the special folks who dont get it <br /> <br />Loved her since I first saw her on MTV in 84! Love her!!! <br />BTW <br /> <br />She took a naughty song(which represents that 'SEX' period) <br />'Erotica' and with a \\"How deep is your love\\" disco-esqu scene from Saturday Night Fever\\" movie and  recreated a Love Song for the  New Disco era! She is brilliant! <br /> <br />U do want a new Love Song, doncha? <br /> <br />watch that song on DVD and you see a love story! <br />The dancer swept her off her feet literally to pulsating hypno beat... <br /> listen to The beat that captures the 70's  eroticism on the dance floor!(some of u folks would remember those moments) <br /> <br />I cant stop playing it over and over again! <br />Listen to it! what a beautiful reworking! its perfect as well as the material <br />Darlings! <br /> <br /> I play the whole DVD and CD over and over again! <br /> <br /> <br />Love Love LOVE IT!! and Her!!!
B00004THAY|4.0|This is a good solid blues CD, with songs varying from toe tapping to mellow. This pairing of performers, was certainly more beneficial for Clapton, than for King. Even at BB's age, his voice is smoother, than Clapton's. As mentioned earlier, there is a full spectrum of songs, ending with the silky smooth, old classic, \\"Come Rain Or Come Shine\\".
0743454537|5.0|I was so absorbed in this touching story that I finished the book in a single weekend, which I rarely do.  The writing style was refreshing (having each chapter narratived by a different character), and the moral questions raised in the story stayed with me long after I finished the last page.  I highly recommend it.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|This one gets 3 star from me, simply because it helped tie up a lot of loose ends from Saw 1& 2.   <br /> <br />I would have to say, I agree with several of the other reviews that point out, this film isn't a \\"true\\" horror film, but rather a suspenceful storyline. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I'd have to disagree with those that gave this film a poor rating, based on the fact that they couldn't understand how the torture gadgets were created or how the victims were abducted in the first place. <br /> <br />If one is to question these facts in this film, the same would have to be applied to all 3 installments, since they all tip the scale of believability to varying degrees. <br /> <br />As I have said before, while giving a review for other items (books, cd's and dvd's alike), I think we are too quick to point out the shortfalls of others, rather than giving credit where credit is due. <br /> <br />Granted, this isn't the best film I've ever seen....by a long shot.  But when I think of the many other totally horrible movies I've seen in the past, I'd have to say, it's definitely not the worst, either. <br /> <br />Not a film I would go out of my way to recommend, but would encourage those who were intrigued by the first two, to finish out the ride while doing as many others and myself are doing............praying this is the end of the line for this story (although as someone else has already said...\\"I doubt it.\\")
B000M5AJQI|5.0|My wife really did, so I grudgingly went along.  \\"Why didn't I want to see it?\\" you ask.  Well, I don't like Mark Wahlberg.  I don't like Matt Damon.  I don't care for DiCaprio and I don't care much for gangster/mob movies either.  So, why the five stars?  This was the best movie I saw in the theaters last year, hands down.  Script - A+.  The acting was spot on.  Jack Nicholson - A+.  Dicaprio - A+.  Matt Damon - B.  Wahlberg - B-/C+.  This movie is full of enough twists, turns, ups, and downs to keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat, but the great thing is that the twists and turns are not forced - they flow smooth as silk this time around with Martin Scorsese confidently at the helm.  The only thing that might make people shy away from this one is that it IS extremely violent.  But, if you can handle beatings, shootings and various other bloody messes, which only serve to add to the seriousness of the situation, then I would recommend this to anyone.
1582701709|5.0|The success of the \\"The Secret\\" video and book offers a classic example of effective viral marketing. The work has emerged into the mainstream through word-of-mouth the same way as \\"What the Beep\\" became a hot hit.<br /><br />Why has \\"The Secret\\" been adopted and promoted by so many? The secret is the law of attraction.  We attract into our lives what we see in our minds. We know this truth in our bones. It's encoded into our DNA. We know without being told that we we think, say and do creates our personal reality as well as our shared social reality.<br /><br />Those who have studied ancient mystical philosophies or modern New Thought already know the secret law of attraction. The wise souls who have applied these principles to change their thinking have seen the effects in their daily lives. \\"The Secret\\" offers suggestions for making the inner changes that yield outer changes.<br /><br />My main criticism is that both the video and the book suffer from too much repetition. The video could have been about 15 minutes shorter, and the book could be about 10-30 pages shorter. How many times do we need to hear different experts saying the same thing? (The DVD has a summary segment that reviews all the cores ideas.)<br /><br />So, if you already know about the law of attraction, the book and video are a refresher course. If these ideas are brand new to you, \\"The Secret\\" will blow your mind, that is, it will blow away your mental blocks. The key, of course, is accepting responsibility for what we draw into our lives. This is where we need common global sense to guide our daily choices.
B000ICLRJ8|4.0|I saw this in the theater and I bought it when it came out on DVD.  Is this worth dropping another $30?  Mmmmmaybe...  I'm a big fan of jet planes, so I get a real kick out of watching the Super Bug turn its tricks.  Once Owen and his pilot find their way onto the ground, the movie combines some somewhat-artsy camera work and a non-stop chase, which is, for the most part pretty entertaining.  The sniper definitely should've had him when he was sitting out in the open though - I mean, c'mon!  But the case goes on until the end, which almost, Almost ruined the movie for me.  I haven't seen any one person escape a hailstorm of gunfire like that untouched in quite some time.  Not even ONE bullet home in the arm or something?  In addition, it's highly unlikely that the captain of an AC carrier will fly in to the rescute in an armed Huey.  Oh well.  If you just close your eyes for about 2 minutes during the end shootout, you'll be fine.  Bottom line - if you like jets, snipers, gunfire, this movie is for you.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|But, it was done once already in \\"Crash\\" for interwoven plots to one powerful end. Then less great \\"Lost in Translation\\" also put the quiet poetic end unlike this one.  <br /> <br />When I watched Babel, I could see how the story would shift but it was slow without much of message,acting or nothing-except the Japanese girl's story, that part could also be concise and powerful without too much of the extra scenes. So, was it for philanthropic purpose? or did it describe the frustration and anger or fear of actors well just like in \\"Crash\\"? <br /> <br />I think this movie is slightly overrated but, then again, for many Americans with little experience of other worlds, this is an amazing opportunity to see the different views and circumstances. <br /> <br />I just do not understand why they don't bother to travel to see the world but to sit behind this movie safely just like the way they showed their love for foreignness in  \\"Lost in translation,\\" which got mediocre review in Asian Cinemas, but caused lots of buzz in USA.  <br /> <br />I did not think this movie really perfected what it should be. But the camera works and editing worked great for its purpose.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|....a great continuation of the first Celtic Woman album.<br /><br />After seeing them on PBS, getting the first CD and seeing them in concert I am hooked.  These ladies can SING!<br /><br />The bonus songs make the album definatly worth the extra few dollars...it includes the fun, upbeat, songs Celtic Woman performs at the ending of their live shows....I was so hoping they would put them on an album.  Live or not, the sound quality is PERFECTION, they sound studio quality.<br /><br />I was a little hesistant at first about the addition of the new member...but she rounds the group up nicely.<br /><br />If I had one complaint it would be the repeat of songs from the individual albums, particularly Chloe's version of \\"The Prayer\\" but for the most part this album is sheer joy...no disappointers here.  I am also not a big fan of \\"Sing Out\\", it seems to simply for the complexity and range of these ladies talents....but overall I am pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />The charm is lovely, but the bonus songs were my main drive for purchasing.  Trust me it was worth it.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I never thought he has that big funny bone. Of course Steven Chow is a big funny actor from 90s with lots of his fan all over Asia. But this movie that he made was the big surprise.  <br /> <br />I think he mastered what makes people laugh in the cinema. And, he used all the graphic to best lead the story.  <br /> <br />I won't say any more, I was hurting myself and tearing in the cinema laughing so much, And, I have watched it more than 5-6 times now. And, it is still amazingly funny. <br /> <br />The making documentary also give a good insight of the movie. I wish the creative Asian movie should debut directly in USA market. Then again, Americans don't like to read subtitles. And dubbed voices tend to work in the animation or comedy.  <br /> <br />In this case, the dubbed English version on DVD is equally as good as the original  with the subtitle.  <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to all viewers!
0618680004|4.0|A serious and detailed discussion of the non-existence of God. Extensive explanations of reason vs. faith. Comprehensive explanations that dismiss/explain many of the criticisms of atheism. <br />Not easy reading, but well worth the effort.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|Absolutely abysmal CD. The remaining Beatles should sue. It was a stretch to give this item one star.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|You know, Scorcese won the Golden Globe for best director for this movie.  Well, and finally, deserved.  I haven't even seen it yet, because I am deaf and have to wait for the DVD and captions.  But, although I do agree that Scorsese needs a new muse (dicaprio), everyone I know says this movie is worth it to see.
B00009XITP|4.0|It really helps to put this movie in perspective if you know a little about the author. William Douglas-Home is the younger brother of Sir Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, 14TH Earl of Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel of Coldstream, who, in October 1963 (8 years after the writing of the play from which this screen-play was adapted), disclaimed his peerages for life, took the name Sir Alec Douglas-Home, and succeeded Harold Macmillan as prime minister of England. The plot, therefore, is an insider's look at an outsider's view of the traditions, the glamour, and of course, the pain and hypocrisy of the British upper class. As such it succeeds remarkably. Sterling performances by Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth are ably complemented by a truly brilliant Anna Chancellor, who manages almost to make you like her \\"wicked stepmother\\" character, or at least feel sorry for her for being so shallow, and an excellent backup from Christina Cole as the evil step-sister-to-be. <br /> <br />This is billed as a teen flick, but it's well worth the price of an evening's rental as wholesome, cute entertainment, no matter how old you are. <br /> <br />Just for fun though, do pay attention to the gross continuity bloopers with the taxi license numbers. Someone's head must have rolled for these!  <br /> <br />  <br />
B000K7VHQE|1.0|This is a distasteful overly hyped movie. The fact that it is Oscar nominated for best picture gives validation to my disrespect for the Oscars.  To think that it is funny for a grandfather to spend hours and hours behind close doors teaching his 7 year old granddaughter an inappropriate dance is a mystery.  Further, to nominate the little girl in the movie for an Oscar is a puzzle as well.  Nothing that she did in the movie is award worthy, there are any number of children actors that act better and have done a better job in roles than she did, Will Smith's son in Pursuit of happyness for example. And where are the child protection laws when it comes to hollywood.  I question a mother who would allow her daughter to play this role.  Aside from all of the inappropriateness, most of the movie was just Not funny to me... I frowned through most of it.
B0002MG9SI|4.0|I'd have to say that those who think this is the greatest French movie can't be getting out much. It has none of the power of \\"Manon des Sources,\\" none of the dramatic flair of \\"Chocolat\\" and very little of the poignancy of \\"Ponette.\\" It is, however, a very well constructed film, and one which it has been fun to watch several times. <br /> <br />To those unfamiliar with French culture, some of the vignettes may miss their targets. The French obsession with collecting odd things, with bicycle racing, with sending postcards from every place they visit, their willingness to be demonstrably affectionate in public, all get lampooned mercilessly. The characters are largely stereotypes; what more can one expect in a movie with so many important characters - there isn't the time to develop each one adequately, so they remain necessarily two dimensional. But it is this two dimensionality of the characters that gives the film its surreal touch that drags the viewer forward from scene to scene, wondering what can possibly happen next. <br /> <br />As comedies go, it lacks the gross slapstick of a de Funes film, and this is very much to its credit. The subtlety of the emotional torture Amélie applies to Collignon the greengrocer is far more entertaining than any pie-in-the-face schtick would have been. Even the running garden gnome joke fails to pall, because it is carefully not overworked. Still, if I had to designate a \\"funniest french movie ever\\", it probably wouldn't be this one - I'd more likely go for the James Bond style \\"Une Chance Sur Deux\\" which managed a better balance of types of humor, with a wider range. <br /> <br />All in all, Amélie is a good movie, but not necessarily a great one. It's one that is worth plopping down the money to rent, or even to buy the DVD, but I would have been disappointed if I'd paid good money to see it in a theatre - there is nothing in the movie that could take advantage of a large screen and theatre surround sound, and nothing in itthat warrants parting with $15 or $20 to see it just once, with antisocial louts making comments and crunching popcorn just behind you.  <br /> <br />
B00005JOCU|4.0|Jennifer Hudson is sensational. Eddie Murphy's musical performances are great. Beyonce is beautiful. Jamie Foxx is ruthless and Danny Glover delivers.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I rented this video expecting a cute, mindless piece of fluff for a relaxing evening's entertainment. What I got was so much more than I bargained for. True, many of the plot twists are pure far-fetched fantasy, but the basic premise was solid, and worked a charm. The primary conflict of the story line was certainly original - New England conservatism vs Left Coast consumerism is not a motif we find every decade, much less every day, in a film of any genre, and certainly not in a comedy of this nature. The gradual maturing of a group of college graduates from widely different backgrounds, as they pursue their dreams and goals at Harvard Law School could have been an excuse for a morass of schtick and slapstick. Instead, it was a sensitive, if amusing coming of age for all the protagonists, including, in the end analysis, some of the older characters. <br /> <br />The acting was above average; it takes enormous skill to play a rôle like Elle Woods - intelligent, determined and resourceful while appearing a stereotypical blonde bimbo - and play it convincingly. And if some (most, actually!) of the serendipities of the plot were less than convincing, some great acting and quite exceptional dialog made up for the poor underpinnings. I'm not a great fan of Reese Witherspoon, but certainly appreciate the panache with which she pulled this one off. There were also some sterling supporting performances, notably by Selma Blair as the rival, who gradually evolves from a horsey country-clubber into a stunning beauty as the film progresses (with appropriate character development from a snooty bitch to a warm friend). <br /> <br />I was particularly impressed by some of the photography in this production. Pay close attention to the shadows in the poolside scene with the Woods family at the beginning of the film! Later, the private interview between Elle and Professor Callahan shows just how much can be conveyed in a handful of seconds of outstanding camera work. And the elevator scene immediately following gets my vote as one of the finest pieces of cinema photography of 2001. <br /> <br />There aren't many films that I would consider worth watching more than once, and even fewer that I have liked enough to want to own them. This one is going to find its way into my personal collection.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|what a great movie about love.  I think that rates as one of my total cry flick, along with Pay it Forward, City of Angels and Angel Eyes.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|What can I say about Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" that hasn't already been said? I watched it originally against my will, to please my wife, and was blown away. I had been led to expect yet another brit-bashing epic where the wicked aristocrats trample the poor working class - that's how it had been presented to me. Instead I found a film that portrayed clearly, accurately, and, most importantly, with balance, the world of the early twentieth century with its vast contrasts between haves and have-nots. <br /> <br />Many have complained about the score, or about Céline Dion's rendering of the theme song. Personally, I believe that the score was as near perfect as any movie score can be. And if you don't happen to like Céline Dion, well, that's your problem. I was a Céline fan back before she ever learned English, and I still am. I still find her version of \\"The Heart Will Go On\\" (minus all the crummy DJ remixes) to be absolutely magical (especially from the top of the Las Vegas Eiffel Tower, looking down on the Bellagio fountain ballet!) <br /> <br />And yes, ten years later, the film still enchants and impresses. Every time I watch it, I'm overwhelmed by the incredible attention to detail, the breadth and depth of the screenplay, the amazing special effects. I could wish that Cameron had eliminated the hokey scene with Jack handcuffed to the pipe, but apart from that, there's nothing I would add to, or take away from this movie. If time has jaded your tastes to the point where you can no longer appreciate it, I feel sorry for you. If \\"maturity\\" has robbed you of the ability to express your appreciation of it, then shame on you. The \\"Mona Lisa\\" is a magnificent work of art, no matter how old it gets, or you get. And so is Cameron's \\"Titanic.\\"  <br /> <br />
0670033375|4.0|I liked this book and looked forward to the next reading stint each time I had to stop.   Here's what I liked:    1. Jared Diamond proposes a framework, five criteria, that he uses as a recurring yardstick to study the outcome of a society.  This helps in comparative analysis even if specific criteria may not fit every case study.    2. He reasons forwards and backwards.  For example, he concludes on the differing diets of classes of people within an ancient social hierarchy from bones found in middens (garbage sites) of multiple buildings within a single excavated site.  In other cases, he sets forth a hypothesis that he then tries to support with evidence.  Actual field work likely calls for both approaches, even if it is easier to do the first.  Sometimes, I found it interesting to search for an alternative hypothesis supported by the same evidence.    3. The book offers a uniquely interconnected way to learn about a number of cultures and civilizations.  A common theme connects them even as you learn about individual societies across space and time.    4. You can learn about some of the methods of science.  An example here is the analysis of lake bed cores.  It's fascinating to learn that each of pollen analysis, charcoal analysis, and sediment analysis tells you something quite different and that they need to be found in a particular order to tell a consistent story (in the sequence above, they suggest deforestation, followed by human-caused fires, and then by erosion).  Another example is the analysis of isotopes of various elements.    A good book but not his best.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|Conventional wisdom has it that the French don't like musicals. Not true at all, as the success of this show demonstrates. Plamondon and Cocciante have concocted a masterpiece that perfectly captures all the important parts of Hugo's novel, and magnificently transports the whole thing to the stage. The handful of young unknowns who star in this production on the video tape (most of them from Quebec) are almost overwhelming in their talent as singers, dancers, and dramatic performers. Bruno Pelletier shines as the anguished, tortured priest. Hélène Ségara (the only French star in the cast) totally captures our hearts as the doomed Esméralda, and Garou (the name means \\"Werewolf\\" in French!) demands and receives all our sympathy as the hapless Quasimodo. Incredibly powerful supporting performances by Patrick Fiori as Phoebus, Julie Zenatti as Fleur-de-lys and Luc Merville as Clopin round out a cast that can do no wrong. <br /> <br />Imagine Riverdance on steroids, \\"West Side Story\\" meets \\"Cirque de Soleil\\", or a Paris riot set to music, and you have an idea of the scope of this incredible show. The choreography is the most energetic, not to say frenetic, I have ever seen, and the most imaginative. It's hard to decide, at times, if we are watching a dance or a gymnastics exhibition. <br /> <br />If you can't get to Las Vegas, Montreal or Paris to see the show live on stage, this is the next best thing. For me it totally eclipsed every rock opera and musical which preceded it, to become the definitive musical of the 20th century. And I believe it will be at least another generation before anyone can come up with a way to surpass it.  <br />
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Terrifically entertaining film featuring non-stop action, comedy and even little romance. Once I accidentally stumbled upon it while channel surfing I was immediatelly in awe. I'm speechless, all I can say is that I will be watching it over and over.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a masterpiece of adapting a novel to film. The script is literate and subtle, the characters and incidents, the plot motivations and restrictions, true to the original. The production values are sumptuous; clearly expense was not spared (in contrast to the previous 1980 BBC production which now looks so budget-minded and trapped indoors). The acting is brilliant, the actors lovely to look at, and every detail is just perfect, including the fact that outfits are worn more than once, in middle-class fashion. Someday this will no doubt be remade with new actors, but I can't imagine that it will be better. <br />

B000063DGC|5.0|this album truly is too good for words.  the late, great randy rhoads puts on a guitar clinic in just about every song and of course the audience is going crazy.  this is one of the better live albums i have heard...it will give you an \\"eargasm.\\"  the notes inside the album are interesting as well; there is a letter his mother, dee, writes to the fans about randy, where he was born and what his future plans was...actually its kinda sad.  its too bad the good have to die young.  the guy was only 26 when he died.  grab this and give it a spin to hear a true guitar wizard work his magic in front of a live audience, i promise it will not dissappoint.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|Celtic Woman: A New Journey by [...] ~ Miami, Florida    They are young, they are beautiful, full of life and full of talent:  The Celtic Woman just released a second album: \\"A New Journey\\"    In their first concert, they were only five girls: four vocalists and a violinist, a wonderful creature fallen from Heaven for our utmost happiness.  If Paradise exists, I picture it full of angels like Máiréad Nesbitt (not necessarily 77 for each warrior...) playing harp or violin!  This is a small blonde with wonderful long hair (I would swim across the Atlantic just to see that hair!) who reminds me of all the poets I have read evoking the nymphs of the woods:  She hops, she jumps, she smiles, she turns like a spinning top, while mastering her fiddle like Paganini.  She alone would justify the purchase of this DVD.    But there is more.  A fifth vocalist (Hayley Westenra) has joined the original four (Chloë Agnew, Órla Fallon, Lisa Kelly and Méav Ní Mhaolchatha).  All of them are lovely, have great voices, and sing in great harmony.    The concert opens with a presentation of the six girls plus David Downes, the Musical Director.  This is followed by a beautiful view of Slane Castle in Ireland, where the concert is staged, under a violin melody played by angel Máiréad.   All five vocalists soon join her in a beautiful song with a rich orchestration.      Unlike André Rieu's concerts, where numbers are often separated by André's jokes or explanations, there is no wasted time here.  The public is still applauding that the next number is already rolling.  The whole concert is thus only 1h30; a plus for businessmen in a hurry...  All others will be able to run it twice after dinner, as I did myself last night.  A supplement shows lovely views of Ireland and Slane Castle.    You will hear immortal songs like the \\"Orinoco Flow\\" (Number 5), \\"Scarborough Fair\\" (No. 8, interpreted by the newcomer: Hayley Westenra), \\"Over the Rainbow\\" (No. 10), followed by \\"Beyond the Sea\\"(11), \\"The Last Rose of Summer\\" (No. 17), \\"Somewhere\\" (the famous song from \\"West Side Story\\", No. 22) and this masterpiece called \\"You Raise Me Up\\", which closes the show.    Most numbers are richly orchestrated with plenty of drums and a choir in the background, like \\"Caledonia\\" (No. 3), \\"Newgrange\\" (No. 4), the \\"Orinoco Flow\\", \\"Dúlaman\\" (No. 6), At the Céili\\" (No. 12), \\"Sing Out\\" (No. 15) or \\"Spanish Lady\\" (No. 18).  These few numbers alone would justify the purchase of this DVD, but I think I already said that about Máiréad...    There are a few notable exceptions like \\"The Blessing\\" (No. 7), interpreted by Lisa Kelly with a discrete piano melody by David Downes, \\"Lascia Ch'io Pianga\\" (No. 13), a languorous classical melody with lots of violins in the background or \\"Carrickfergus\\" (No. 14) interpreted by Órla Fallon while she plays the harp, or \\"Panis Angelicus\\" (No. 16), interpreted by Chloë Agnew accompanied by a violoncello and soft violins, with a discrete choir jumping in later on.  And let's not forget \\"Shenandoah\\" (No. 19), a violin solo by Máiréad (no jumping this time: she is grave like a grown up person) with David at the piano.    Remember the famous \\"Over the Raimbow\\", created by Judy Garland in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" in 1939 and wonderfully interpreted by Suzan Erens in André Rieu's \\"The Flying Dutchman\\"?  Well, you will hear a new version \\"a cappella\\" by four of the girls.  And, trust me, you won't miss the orchestra.  They will do it again with the famous \\"Somewhere\\".      When I was fifteen (many, many, many moons ago...) my professor of classical guitar in Havana used to say that the best number is always the one that closes the show.  Well, this is still the case.  Just like the first concert, this one ends with the same number: a masterpiece written by Rolf Loveland and Brendan Graham and made famous by Josh Groban titled \\"You Raise Me Up\\":  \\"I am strong when I am on your shoulders, you raise me up to more than I can be.\\"      But, afterall, didn't Oscar Wilde say it already in \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\"?:  \\"Aimer c'est se surpasser\\" said the French translation that I read with my students in Paris ~ To love is to transcend yourself.
B000002KE2|5.0|While not as raw and heavy and depressing as Master Of Reality, Vol.4 is possibly the best album Black Sabbath ever released.  Every song seems to represent every possible human emotion and never let up.  From The Wheels Of Confusion to Under The Sun, this album reads as somewhat of a commentary on the ups and downs of life from naive childhood to the state of young adulthood where you struggle to find your own way in life with every other influence cracking at your skull, trying to manipulate you into conforming to it's standard.  I don't think this is just an album for metal heads, musically and ideal-wise it goes way beyond certain boundaries of metal.  I certainly can't find anything about Judas Priests' British Steel that is anywhere as remarkable or thought-provoking as this album.  My biggest musical loves are punk, and other forms of alternative music and I think that anyone who has a musical taste even slightly like mine can truly enjoy and appreciate Vol. 4.  I think that this album could suit the tastes of anybody who's into the Beatles and Pink Floyd just the same as those who'd prefer Black Flag and The Circle Jerks.  I've owned this album in cd and vinyl form for almost seven years and it is still important to me.  Hell, I personally think this beats the hell out of overrated release like Dark Side Of the Moon.  I could be over-analyzing but I strongly suggest that any lover of true music at least give this one a listen.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|This is a movie to watch on a rainy or snowy night. It's interesting and enjoyable but also a little to long. The illusion is really the whole second half of the movie. I didn't really get the thing with the ghosts, because of the previously mentioned illusion, \\"why\\". I will have to watch it again someday to see what I missed but I don't really want to watch it again soon, thus only 3 stars.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|With Hypnotize and the previously released Mesmirize I believe System Of A Down have officially come to the status of a band that is essential to this decade in musical history.  This band is a beautiful blend of everything that was good about different genres of rock music from the late sixtes to the mid to late nineties.  The Beatles, Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Roxy Music, The Sex Pistols, The Clash, Devo, The Dead Kennedys, The Bad Brains, Slayer, The Melvins, Nuclear Assault, The Pixies, Nirvana, Public Enemy, Ministry, Rage Against The Machine, and Refused seem to have been put in a blender and blasted through the highest gauged gun to impact the listeners' personal spaces with such a wonderful musical masterpeice.  Whereas Toxicity seemed to show the band somewhat catering to the moronic Kid Rock and Alien Ant Farm-loving crowd, these two cds have shown SOAD to be a force that you cannot reckon with.  Every song on here with their individual insanity, despair, anger, and dark humor is proof that despite the fashion-obsessed Fuse-sponsored pop-punk, emo, screamo, and painfully pretentious metalcore and metal-alike, true art and passion still exists.  This is possibly for today what Double Nickles On The Dime and Frankenchrist were for the eighties.  I compare Mesmerize, Hypnotize, and every other musical peice at least somewhat like them and with a common-sense, desperate, and angry left-wing point of view and compare it to the spineless right-wing crap of today like three doors down, nickleback, and godsmack and wonder how it is that lefties are considered so inferior to the right-winged flock.  System Of A Down have reaffirmed my love and faith in my taste in music and personal belief.  I personally recommend this release specifically to any who have lost hope within the musical and political stupidity of the world today.  If The Soldier Side doesn't make your heart swell, then you're probably not human!
B000FGGE68|3.0|The sound on my surround system was great. That's the reason I'm giving it 3 instead of 2 stars. Yes Milla is great too but there's not any sexy scenes or anything so if thats all your watching it for you might be disappointed.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|To get it over with, I did laugh at portions of the movie.  I have used the f word unfortunately in my life.  It is a segment of our society. I am not a prude.<br /><br />Having said all that, this is a pathetic movie.  Searching the local DVD shop for a movie, noticed this one about the plot and then amazed at interest in it, they were sold out continually.  When finally able to rent a disc, sorry that we did.<br /><br />It glorifies a very dysfunctional family, showing that they support each others dysfunction and we're supposed to find it hilarious?  Pity the culture that raves and craves such humourous relief?  Put into the same category as the other films that duped me into watching, e.g. Sideways.  Components are the same:  use filthy language, clear graphic sex descriptions, etc.  What have we come to that we have most of a whole media segment turning out such stuff, and we are all consuming it?<br /><br />Enough from a small segment who disdain such.  If you're even concerned about such, don't waste your time or budget on such.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|This was a very well made movie and great actors. This is probably the best movie I've seen lately as most really aren't that good. The politics of it is really a dictator violently making people conform to their ideals in society. And some of his ideals are not good of course and just for his own benefit.
0689829590|4.0|I got this book for my toddler. He was fascinated to see all sizes and shapes of the moon and relate them to the real moon. He now gets up saying \\"moon grew and grew\\".  <br /> <br />When I draw for him he wants me to draw the phases of the moon. He loves the part where the dad tries to climb up and up for the moon. He loves this book.  <br /> <br />But unfortunately , I think I should have delayed giving him this book. The page where the moon unfolds is very flimsy. My son wants to look at that page and there is no way the book is going to stand a toddler's grab! That is my only concern. I got the board book online thinking that I could give it to him to read for himself. He likes to do that. But this book has been a sad experience for him in that way as he can't have the book he really loves.  <br /> <br />Infact he can even handle hardcover or paperback books well. But the unfolding moon is very flimsy and doesnt fold back very well after a few reading sessions.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|Compared to Ultraviolet, Aeon Flux was definitly a better movie. I liked both though, especially the sound tracks. This movie also is visually stunning and that's why I'm giving it 4 instead of 3 stars. Very well made unlike a surprisingly many poor DVD's you see.
0618680004|5.0|Even if this book ends up only \\"preaching to the choir\\", its eloquence and intellectual stamina will give the choir more than it needs to sing of truth and reality as it is, not as those still possessed and beguiled by supernaturalistic mythology believe it is. It's the 21st century and we are still worshiping bronze age mythology?  Dawkins devastatingly points out all the fallacies and weaknesses of supernaturalism and arms are rational thinking people with the words and ideas they need to take on all the morally and intellectually bankrupt religions in the world.  It's about time. Thanks Richard!
0143034901|4.0|I gave this 4 stars as the first half of the book was definitely a five star book, but the latter half was definitely a three star novel.<br /><br />Where to begin... I read this as it was highly recommended to me and I wanted to read something that I normally wouldn't read on my own. Once I got used to Zafon's style of writing (it's a bit cheesy and made me lol at some points) and got into the book I was fascinated. I loved it. I loved the plot, loved the characters and really thought it was going to be my favorite book of the year. Not only that, but I kept telling everyone that I loved this book. I couldn't put it down - until I reached the crux of the book.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, but I did not care for the ending at all. I felt cheated by the way Zafon decided to wrap it all up in a nice little package and go on his way.<br /><br />Overall, I would still recommend this as a good read as the first half was HIGHLY entertaining, but cannot call it a favorite as I was disappointed in the how Zafon concluded the plot.
B000N3SSBM|5.0|Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry have both created some mind-bending films -- \\"Being John Malkovich,\\" \\"Adaptation,\\" \\"Human Nature.\\"<br /><br />But this brilliant writer and director take a slightly different turn on in \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" a romantic comedy with a dark, melancholy streak. With brilliant acting and wonderfully quirky, funny<br /><br />Uptight Joel (Jim Carrey) runs into his ex-girlfriend Celementine (Kate Winslet) at a bookstore, and is shocked that not only does she not remember him, but she has a new boyfriend. Turns out that she had him erased from her memory, courtesy of a new memory-erasing technique. When he learns why she broke up with him (she thought he was boring), he gets mad and decides to have the same thing done to himself.<br /><br />A group of offbeat technicians (Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst) arrive at his house, and put Joel into a deep sleep as they erase his memories. But as he relives his experiences with Clementine, Joel realizes that while their relationship ended badly, the good times he had with her are precious to him. So he tries to put her into other parts of his memory, so that she will never be totally forgotten...<br /><br />\\"Dark romantic comedy\\" is the closest thing that \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" has to a description. Like Kaufman's other films, it's funny in a subtle way, and more obviously sweet and romantic. Not to mention thought-provoking -- if you could erase unpleasant memories, would you do it, if it changed the person you were? If we get rid of the pain, do we also get rid of the joy that came with it?<br /><br />Michel Gondry is best known for his work on surreal, entrancing music videos, so he fits perfectly into directing \\"Eternal Sunshine.\\" It takes a brilliant director to give us a convincing trip through a person's brain, and he does it well -- surreal imagery (a teeny Carrey getting bathed in a sink?), bright colours, and the sight of entire experiences vanishing.<br /><br />But Gondry also spins up some truly beautiful romantic scenes (Carrey and Winslet lying on the ice), in a way that seems realistic, yet leaves the viewer with hope for Joel and Clementine's erased love. It's a pretty stark contrast to that creepy subplot about Wood using the erased memories to seduce Winslet -- just get a girlfriend the normal way!<br /><br />A serious Carrey and punky-haired Winslet are amazing in these roles, as the lovelorn, repressed Joel and the free-spirited, wacky Clementine. They're a flawed couple, but you want to see them get back together. Kirsten Dunst has a bittersweet subplot about the memory erasure, while Wood takes what could have been a 2-D creep and makes him  a rather pitiful, lonely figure,<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman's fertile brain and Gondry's amazing direction produced a beautiful, romantic movie that doesn't resemble any other.

006054094X|4.0|Gavin Menzies should be congratulated for this book.  From his writing it is obvious that he invested an incredible amount of time, thought, creativity and energy into researching his idea and bringing it to print.  If the mark of a good book is to make a nice profit for the writer and printer, or to grab the reader's attention and carry him through the book, or  to make the reader think and debate the author's position, then this book deserves 5 stars.  Much has been offered from the many reviewers of this book.  Gavin Menzies deserves credit for bringing such interest to a 500 year old story and I hope he earns a  million bucks for his effort. <br /> <br />The book's premise is that around 1420 Chinese eunuchs under the orders of the Ming Emperor made an incredible voyage over two years and literally explored the entire world from the coast of Antarctica to the North Pole, sailing the length and breadth of every ocean and landing on every continent save one:  Europe.  Sadly, all the records of this voyage were intentionally destroyed upon their return.  One European merchant sailed on the voyage and was able to get copies of all their maps which he smuggled back to Europe.  The Portuguese co-opted this information and ... \\"the rest is history.\\"  <br /> <br />Like the Platte River of America's west, this book is a mile wide and an inch deep.  It is so full of riddles and explanations that doubtless some of Gavin Menzies suggested solutions are correct, but how many and which ones?  There is not enough data here to convince me of even one. <br /> <br />Throughout the book he relates that his experience as a career Officer of the Royal Navy and CO of a submarine makes him uniquely qualified to report on this subject.  He has included enough errors in this book that I doubt his credibility.  (Although I am no expert I have spent the last 3 years sailing with my family from the east coast of the USA through the South Pacific to Australia and SE Asia.  I have taught mychildren how to use a sextant and am quite comfortable with the southern skies.) <br />1.  pg 161.  Any navigator who has actually used the stars in the southern hemisphere immediately knows that Canopus and Alpha Centauri are the primary navigation stars used.  Whether you are Chinese, British, American or a Polynesian, you would first use these each evening/morning, not the stars of the Southern Cross.  He should know this.  Furthermore, he never explains what useful navigational information is to be gained by \\"sailing under a star?\\" <br />2.  pg 355 incorrectly states a league as 4.7 nautical miles when it is really 2.7 nautical miles.  No naval historian should make such a mistake. <br />3.  pg 224 he relates an experience he supposedly had with the Great Barrier Reef:  \\"I remember very well how my submarine was hemmed in by the reef, and the relief I felt as I escaped from the straitjacket where the reef ends off Brisbane.\\"  The Great Barrier Reef doesn't start until Lady Musgrave Island NE of Hervey Bay nearly 200 miles north of Brisbane and it is hardly a straightjacket until much further north.  Is Menzies' memory failing or is this whole passage made up? <br />4.  As a sub commander he knows that logistical supply of a ship (beans, bacon and bandaids)  is everything.  Even a cursory reading of Cooke's experiences (real documented history) shows the never-ending efforts he went to just to supply his own small crew as they sailed the Pacific.  This book's whole premise of the voyage around the world by so many falls apart when you consider the fact that people have to eat and drink every day. <br />5.  He shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the effect of ocean currents on a vessel/squadron of ships under sail power.  At least half the time in this book he presents the Chinese as if they were floating on rafts rather than sailing ships. <br /> <br />Revisionist history is nothing new.  This book, although more a novel than history, clearly represents the \\"anyone but the west\\" school of thought.  Although entertaining, books like this one, which lightly accuse Columbus of forgery and fraud and Cooke of plagiarism ultimately have little to offer a serious reader. <br /> <br />I have read that in law school student lawyers are advised: \\"If you have a strong case you pound the case, if you have a weak case you pound the table.\\"  This book is a table-pounder as far as history is concerned.  It is an entertaining and easy read but should be placed on your bookshelf next to Chariots of the Gods and The Late Great Planet Earth.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Academy Award winners Tim Robbins (Mystic River) and Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) shine in the outstanding 1994 prison drama \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\". Set in the 1940s, successful banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is wrongfully accused for the murders of his wife and lover and is sentenced to serve two life sentences at Shawshank Prison. Over the 20 years, Andy eventually gains the respect of his fellow inmates and forms a strong friendship with a resourceful life-timer (Freeman). Based on the novel by Stephen King, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is a perfectly crafted and emotionally moving film triumph. The 142-minute drama features a compelling plot and great performances by Robins and Freeman. The fine cast also includes Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler and James Whitmore. Though \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" failed in theaters, it received favorable reviews from critics, was nominated for seven Academy Awards and gained a strong following upon television airings and home video release.<br /><br />If you haven't picked up this fantastic film then don't miss out on \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" Special Edition. The 1994 prison drama is presented in a fine 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The Special Edition has exactly the same transfer as the earlier DVD release but it is still a sharp and colorful transfer. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is clear and well balanced. The 2-Disc DVD includes an audio commentary with writer/director Frank Darabont, two detailed behind-the-scenes featurettes, a 42-minute interview with the film's director and cast, trailers and a 24-minute spoof of the film. Overall, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" scores a winning \\"A\\".

The executions of the supposed members of Black September become repetitive in rather quick fashion and the over the top preaching by the characters about the duality of their assignment (are they creating more terrorism than they are eliminating--sound familiar?) is trite and not believable...Overall this film comes off as one made by an AMERICAN-Jew descent...I would like to have seen the same film as made by someone who is an American first and Jewish second...I would like to see the same film done by someone who is a Jew first and an American second...the product would be far more gripping and with a lot less hand wringing...
B000I0RNVG|5.0|I agree 100% with the previous reviewer.  Here I found myself, on Super Bowl Sunday, watching this beautiful film for the upteenth time, where as has been pointed out, was shown on TMC last evening.  The film is one which must be experienced rather than discussed.  The love of a little boy in wartime Italy, which metamorphisizes into his love for the father-figure who provides him with this outlet, is moving, sensitive, and above all, so human.  The film is highly atmospheric, and one almost feels like they are right there in the middle of the village, which is so simple and bumpkin-like, that the Paradiso Theater offers the occupants their only source of entertainment.  Time passes, and the boy comes to love his mentor as he would have loved his own father (who dies as a casulty of World War II).  The true nature of this father-son love is not really revealed until the film's conclusion.  Make no mistake:  this is a gem of a film in any language.  I'd love to see our American film \\"geniuses\\" come up with something which even approaches the sheer beauty of \\"Cinema Paradiso\\".
B00005JPKC|5.0|<br />Letters from Iwo Jima was an after thought of Clint Eastwood after he had read some of the letters written by Japanese soldiers.  Letters was budgeted at 20 million while Flags of Our Fathers had a 90 million budget.  Viewing both films gives us a full picture of a cataclysmic battle that from our perspective of sixty years seems a terrible waste of life.   <br /> <br />The film provides perspectives from that on an enlisted man (Saigo, a baker played by Kazunari Ninomiya) and General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by Ken Watanabe) through their actions on the island and flashbacks.  So, we learn that General Kuribayashi, a career soldier in the cavalry, lived for a time in the United States where he received as a gift a Colt revolver from his American hosts and that Saigo was drafted after his baking equipment was confiscated to be used in the war effort.  The film begins with the arrival of General Kuribayashi on Iwo Jima and chronicles the hard life of the defenders plagued with dysentery, poor rations and the heat.  Kuribayashi takes up what his officers feel is a poor defense of the island by digging tunnels and not creating trenches on the beach.  The one ally Kuribayashi has among his officers is Baron Nishi, a pragmatic man who had been in the equestrian events in the 1932 Olympics held in Los Angeles and makes his first appearance riding a horse.  There is a feeling of doom over the garrison as little by little they receive mounting bad new: the destruction of what remains of the Japanese fleet, that no additional tanks can be sent and that no reinforcements can be expected.   <br /> <br />Kuribayashi maintains a positive front that the battle can be won but everyone in the Japanese garrison can sense immanent defeat. As with Flags of Our Fathers, the battle scenes where filmed showing the ferocity of the fighting and the suicides of many of the Japanese soldiers.  There is a scene where a Japanese commander ignores the order of Kuribayashi to withdraw and orders his men, one of whom is Saigo, to commit suicide, which they do with hand grenades (tying in to a scene from Fathers).  Several of the soldiers are clearly reluctant to kill themselves but only Saigo and another soldier are left alive.  <br /> <br />In a film filled with memorable performances two stand out. Ken Watanabe gives a magnificent performance as General Kuribayashi given him a heroic but vulnerable character as he draws sketches of happier past events.  At one point, it appears that the waste of lives almost convinces him that he should surrender but then a broadcast from his home town if Japan by a group of children imploring him to defend them changes his mind.  Kazunari Ninomiya as Saigo is excellent as a reluctant soldier who is doing his duty but would rather surrender that be killed or commit suicide.  Kuribayashi and Saigo are at opposite ends; one heroic and the other pragmatic but the two interact several times in the film and Kuribayashi is instrumental in saving Saigo.   <br /> <br />The film is beautifully photographed using mono-chromatic colors that give it a feel of old photographs.  Like Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jim tells an unvarnished story about the horrors of war; the difference with Letters is that the cause is lost and the heroism is tinged with desperation.  I highly recommend seeing both Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima.  Together they present an unforgettable story of a battle that marked the beginning of the end of the war in the Pacific.     <br />
B000M4RG42|5.0|As a former Marine and combat veteran, I was somewhat reluctant to watch this movie. However, I did, alone, some parts bringing tears to my eyes, because I know what losing a friend in combat is like and the aftermath.    This is as true a depiction of the incident that occurred on Mount Suribachi, on the island of Iwo Jima, 1945, as Hollywood is ever lightly to achieve. One, the 1949 \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" with John Wayne, using much of the footage shot during the actual battle by Marine cameramen, may come Hollywood close to telling the story of combat Marines in the Pacific.    In response to some previous reviews, this was not supposed to be a typical Hollywood view of war. \\"Heroes\\" did not jump off the screen, nor were they supposed to. These were Marines who had a job to do. A very small part of that job was raising a flag on top of Mount Suribachi. Hollywood, the media and the political money-grubbers got hold of an accidental photo and ran with it to raise money. The surviving flag raisers were used to that end. That's the story. Not the individuals, per sé.    As one character said early in the movie, the loudest screams, or whatever, will come from those who never saw combat. Being a movie \\"aficionado\\" does not make anyone capable of understanding combat unless you have been there.    That said, this movie was, I believe, produced with reverence and humility, showing the very nature of the Marine Corps, that \\"Uncommon Valor was a Common Virtue.\\" I don't expect civilians to comprehend that, but there it is. Although the \\"characters\\" may not have been fleshed out enough for some \\"movie aficionados\\", the movie showed the story of the men who raised the flag, two of whom were eventually destroyed by their fame. Obviously, Navy Corpsman, \\"Doc\\" Bradley, managed to remove himself from the limelight and get on with his life, never mentioning the fact that he had earned the Navy Cross, this country's second highest combat award, even to his own family. As the characters and real men said, they were NOT the heroes of Iwo Jima. The heroes were still on that island - dead.    Just to appease \\"aficionados\\", etc, there were several minor technical issues I had with the movie. Some web gear used was Viet Nam era, not WW II. Language: On a ship or on land, Marines and sailors never say \\"door\\". The word is \\"HATCH\\". This is in no way a racist comment, but there were no black Americans in the Marine Corps until the 1950s, although the movie showed what appear to be several black Marines at a briefing on the ship, prior to the in itial landing. I'm sure this was a Hollywood PC moment, but it was not correct. Just for emphasis, the only color in the Marine Corps is combat green. In other words a Marine is a Marine. Period.    The movie is excellent and well produced, and well worth seeing, even if you are a civilian \\"movie aficionado\\". But I suggest others don't pay attention to self-styled \\"aficionados\\", who know precious little about the content of this movie in particular and what Eastwood was doing.
0316172324|5.0|The book is part of a new genre - the short \\"sum of articles\\" around a concept.  (Think Freakonomics for the most successful of the genre)  In these essays, Malcom Gladwell covers why we make decisions so quickly, why they're frequently right, and how to work around the poor decisions we can find ourselves in. <br /> <br />It's definitely not high science or a textbook, but it's good pop science.  It'll only take a night or two to learn about our mind's ability to short-circuit our supposedly rational decisions.
B00003CXIP|4.0|Based off of Stephen King's short story \\"the body\\", Stand by me is a movie about 4 12 year-old boys on a journey to \\"become the heros\\" by finding another lost 12 year old. They get the information that the body of this kid is about 30 miles outside of town near the railroad a backroad, so the set off to \\"discover him\\" and be forever famous as the kids that found this boy.  Along the way they learn some lessons and do some \\"growing up\\", and have one last magical adventure before starting Junior High that fall.   <br />To me, this movie was better when I was that age, but seems to have lost some luster in my older years.  Still a good flick. Staring a young jerry o'connell, Also Wil Wheaton (Star trek: the next generation), River Phoenix, and Cory Feldman.  Kiefer Sutherland plays a high school gang leader that picks on the boys.  So a great cast of young actors.  Enjoyable classic now on DVD
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Premiering in the 2005-2006 season on The WB, which turned out to be the last season ever for the network (which merged with UPN to become The CW), \\"Supernatural\\" proved to be the only new hit the network would have. Blending horror and family drama, the show has become a cult hit with a fiercely loyal fanbase. Unlike most recent series that dabbles in horror/supernatural/science fiction, \\"Supernatural\\" goes the route of \\"The X-Files\\", mainly comprised of stand alone stories with occasional mythology episodes, but unlike \\"The X-Files\\", the mythology is this show is fairly simple and won't get as complicated or confusing. <br /> <br />I had been looking forward to this show for almost a year before it premiered, back when it was first announced that The WB was developing it. Fortunately the show turned out to be just as good as I thought it would, although it's not without it's flaws.  <br /> <br />The show stars Jensen Ackles (Dark Angel, Smallville) and Jared Padalecki (Gilmore Girls) as two adult brothers who are on a quest to find their missing father. Along the way they hunt down spirits, demons, and monsters, but this is nothing new to them: when they were children their mother was murdered by a demon and their father, hellbent on revenge, taught himself how to hunt and taught his children to do the same. Since, Sam had a falling out with his father and left to go to college, but his brother has pulled him back into this dangerous world of hunting. <br /> <br />\\"Supernatural\\" is a very fun, very entertaining series. It's not usually scary for me, nor will it be for those who have been exposed to the horror genre for many years, but the show does terrify many. You may be surprised at how effective and creepy the show can sometimes get, but overall the writers need to learn set up, and how to make things truly scary - psychological horror is often more effective than things jumping out at you, but the writers seem to forget that a lot. The other flaw is that Jared sometimes overacts his \\"emotional\\" scenes, and it's enough to make you roll your eyes.  <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Supernatural\\" is a great series. Creepy and stylish, it's bound to attract those who love \\"The X-Files\\", \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", and other similar shows. And if you're a guy, like me, don't let the often misleading advertising or high number of tween fangirls fool you: this show is not your typical drama from The WB, and is written by a bunch of guys, and therefore is equally as appealing to male horror fans. During much of the season there also tends to be a \\"beauty of the week\\" that figures into the story, which sure didn't bother me. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for fans of the genre.
0757302661|5.0|I just gave birth to my third child using the methods described in this book and working with a hypnobirthing therapist who worked with me. This was my first time using hypnosis, and I believe it made a huge difference. (I had a c-section the first time, and over 24 hour labors for both.) My third child was born only two hours after I arrived at the hospital. I did have pain then, but the early labor was not painful at all. I wasn't even sure I was in labor, and I let my husband take the kids ice skating with friends. I had to call them back.  When I finally did have some pain, she was born about 3 to 4 hours later.  <br /> <br />The book is defintely worth it and you definitely need the cd. The book has information that I have not seen in any pregnancy/labor book. The breathing methods are also new to me -- and I teach yoga -- and they were very beneficial. Frankly, we were all shocked how easy the delivery was; although my hypnotherapist said it would go quick, but I was rather skeptical. She was right, because she has seen it happen over and over. She said usually she has a difficult time getting to the hospital in time for the births.  <br /> <br />The only draw back with the method is that you are supposed to have a partner to practise the relaxation techniques. My husband was not really into this, so I did it mainly on my own. He did participate in the last week or so when he saw that the methods kept me calm and sane, and alleviated my fears of childbirth and hospitals.

B0009X7664|4.0|Great packaging, deluxe and sturdy.Extras ranging from pretty good to excellent on Disc 1. The reason  for 4 star-rating and not 5 is that Disc 2 is a bit of a snooze, though not entirely. Too much of Disc 2's content seems to show Peck so much later on in his life, it would have been better to include more vintage footage from the era, circa 1962,if any such footage is available (Johnny Carson, or Jack Paar or whoever hosted such shows in the day). It just would have been nice to see more of Peck's career at the time, or any Premiere footage, Golden Globes, whatever. Love the 11 international mini-poster reproductions.
B00005JPCY|4.0|Saw it yersterday...Loved it!!!<br /><br />Denzel Washington and Tony Scott team up once more for non-stop action a plenty, with Jim Cavaziel supporting in the bad guy role, played superbly I must add. A few other faces you may recognise and others you will not, such as Paula Patton, who plays the leading lady and love interest, which gets a little complicated as she is dead for over half the movie.<br /><br />If you're a fan on Tony Scott's work and a fan of Denzel's, don't hesitate in seeing this, you will like it. It is a little predictable, but at the same time does explore new territory.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I am a newbie to Josh's sound and couldn't believe my ears when I heard his voice.  I am very eclectic with music styles and am into more alternative bands, folk, etc but I kept reaching for his CD, which was a gift from a friend and I can't thank him enough. <br /> <br />I listened to \\"Awake\\" several times and thought, well yes, he is not as soulful as James Blunt or a few others on the popular scene but he is more commanding and powerful and personally I think his voice is simply near perfect. I love opera too, so it was great to have a contemporary take on that style. <br /> <br />After listening to this album I bought all of his earlier albums and am enjoying getting to know this guy and seeing how his voice and talent is progressing.  My friends probably will think I am nuts...but I am amazed by this guy's talent. <br /> <br />Wow, his parents must be unbelievably proud.  What a voice!  Can you imagine what a monumental success he will become as he ages and progresses in his musical career. <br /> <br />--An INSTANT JOSH GROBAN FAN! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000000H42|5.0|I first heard Mercyful Fate from Emperor's cover of \\"Gypsy\\".  (Emperor's version is better than Mercyful Fate's, in my opinion.)  I loved King Diamond's stuff long before I got this.  I bought this and it's great.  It strongly resembles King Diamond's early (solo?) work such as Fatal Portrait and Abigail.  The music on this album is in the \\"heavy metal\\" style, not black metal or any other type of metal.  Just heavy metal.
0393967913|5.0|Since Edward Said wrote  his foolish piece on Mansfield Park it has become de rigeur to attach agendas that reflect the intramural (ie bogus) leftism of the academy to novels (sorry texts) Even so this effort to do so in Mansfield Park is particularly outlandish. In fact the question \\"What is  Mansfield Park about\\" is less interesting than the question \\"what is it like to read Mansfield Park\\" To  answer that question one has to explore the LANGUAGE of the novel and see where it leads. The plot of Mansfield Park is off-putting--the verbal architecture of  the novel is unsurpassed. Trust me--delight in the language, the layers of irony in a sentence or scene. Ignore current opinion which is both intellectually lazy as well as dishonest. Jane Austen made her feelings clear about the slave trade in EMMA. That  A \\"political\\" intereprative industry should have grown up about this book testifies to the reigning stupidities  of English Studies-- well an English Professor has got to make a living.<br /><br />Since writing the first part of this review  I have revised my opinion. I had ignored the Book's title--Lord Mansfield--to whom the title surely must refer takes us to the famous  Somerset case 0f 1772 (a land mark decision about slavery) and indirectly to the Gordon riots.<br />I still believe Said overextends himself but I now think Slavery is a concern of this novel.Austen was a great admirer of the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson as her letters tell us. Austen's concerns were wide ranging but she is no pamphleteer--it was a mistake on my part to neglect the range and depth of her perception.
B00000JRTX|2.0|Nice visually but superficial. Parading the usual Hollywood values<br /><br />\\"Sleeping around is a  positive thing\\". \\"self centeredness\\" also very positive. Funnily enough the funeral was the best part of the movie and john Hannah's eulogy the highpoint of the film. I like  Andie MacDowell  But her role was pretty much confined to looking pretty and sensitive. Hugh Grant just bumbled.  I am not sure it deserves even a 2.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|Discussions about the global warming issue can very quickly take on the tone of religious warfare, as some of the reviews here show.  I want to focus on the video as a video, reviewing some of its interesting features-- and some of its limitations.<br /><br />Those looking for an introduction to global warming should buy the book in addition to-- or maybe instead of-- the DVD.  Obviously, the film parallels the book, but it is, after all, a film of Gore giving his presentation.  That means that there's no way to look at the charts and graphs closely or to think about them before moving on.  In fact, some of them go by so quickly or lose so much detail as the camera pans out that it's not easy to understand what they're showing.<br /><br />Further, like the book, this is at most a very general introduction to global warming issues.  It's best suited to an audience that doesn't have much of a technical background.  (Like me; and, for the record, in the last year, I moved from the skeptic's camp to that of the non-fanatic believers.)  There certainly is a little Bush-bashing and a generally negative attitude toward Republican policies.  That's not too surprising, considering that Gore has spent his life as a Democratic political figure.  In any event, they're pretty mild.  While Gore's explanations of global warming are pretty convincing, his suggested solutions to the problem (mostly strict adherence to the Kyoto treaty and living a \\"carbon-neutral\\" lifestyle) seem to me to be very much open to debate.<br /><br />In my view, the impact of the film is somewhat reduced by the occasional personal vignettes about Gore's upbringing, his son's serious accident, and his sister's death.  I suspect that they were inserted in order to personalize Gore, much the same way that family shots and personal stories are inserted into football games.  That's fine, but to me, they were intrusions that were very nearly non sequiturs.<br /><br />On the other hand, one of the interesting things about the film is that it does indeed personalize Gore.  I voted for him in 2000, though with no real enthusiasm, and I've always seen him as an earnest but really boring gasbag.  Watching him in this film changed that for me.  He's clearly a guy with a passion for this issue; further, he's clearly intelligent and articulate.<br /><br />The film-as-film is very well done.  At first thought, the idea of a video of a guy giving a PowerPoint slide show seems like a very bad one for a film, but the director and camera people pull it off.  It's well paced, cleverly staged, well lighted, etc.  Lectures can be interesting, and this film demonstrates that.<br /><br />I thought the film was well worth seeing.  There is a lot to think about here, and it's a well-conceived and well-executed film, which probably does deserve its Oscar nomination.  It has limitations, but I'm glad I bought it, and I recommend it.eresting things about the film is that it does indeed personalize Gore.

0684824906|5.0|Nearly 150 years after his death, his life and words memorized and revered, Abraham Lincoln holds America's closest Christ-like mythology. Raised from humble beginnings, exposed while young man to unspeakable family tragedy, he grew into one wise beyond his years. He was resilient in defeat, gracious and forgiving in victory, hungry for knowledge and debate, and anxious to turn lessons learned into humorous anecdotes and allegories which became American folk parables.<br /><br />Lincoln's growing power and reputation, culminating with his years as America's 16th President, had the opposite effect on him as on most men. He became an emancipator leading his country's redemption from slavery, its copious national sin. (Author Doris Kearns Goodwin demonstrates this in a moving episode with Lincoln and a group of freed slaves after Richmond's fall). He also became a reconciler and unifier, balancing forces within his Cabinet, Republican party, and legislature. Finally, it made him a central point within a country torn by its bloodiest, most divisive war. Lincoln's death on Good Friday 1865 by vengeful conspirators only exclaims the irony, even though reconstruction (not resurrection) followed.<br /><br />Ms. Goodwin's title, \\"Team of Rivals,\\" effectively summarizes her book's purpose. It refers to Lincoln's cabinet: men like Treasury secretary Salmon Chase, postmaster general Montgomery Blair, War secretary Edwin Stanton and, most of all, Secretary of State William Seward. Each man rivaled Lincoln at different points in their respective political and legal careers, from Stanton snubbing him in an early patent infringement case to Chase plotting an 1864 presidential run while serving his opponent for the nomination.<br /><br />But through her subtitle, \\"The Political Genius of..,\\" Ms. Goodwin shows how Lincoln's eloquence, humor, sense of timing, and ability to see beyond political ideology formed his unique wisdom. \\"She describes it as \\"...not simply the ability to gather the best men of the country around him, but to impress upon them his own purpose, perception, and resolution at every juncture.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Goodwin successfully places her Civil War history within the cabinet intrigues, as the war's exhausting loss of lives and treasure affects each team member deeply and differently. Lincoln and his wife mourn their son Willie's death, giving them empathy toward soldiers and their families fighting on both sides. The ambitious Chase loses his powerful, dedicated daughter Kate to a stormy marriage with industrialist William Sprague, while dealing with mortal enemies in his government. Attorney General Edward Bates maintains his long, loving relationship with wife Julia. Stanton orders derelict Union soldiers shot despite family pleas, crying and mourning over his role.<br /><br />These powerful side stories give \\"Team of Rivals\\" an historical novel's drama even as Ms. Goodwin's summarizes Lincoln's legends (walking miles to return a book), retells decisive Civil War battles and reprints Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural, memorized by schoolchildren as late as 30 years ago. It's a tribute to her writing style that Lincoln's assassination (with the equally grisly attack on Seward and his son Fred) regains its ghastly shock 150 years later in the book's final chapter. This happens even as both warring sides realize they'd have no more forgiving political friend than he of which Stanton would eulogize, \\"Now he belongs to the ages.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Goodwin has written her finest works on American presidents (FDR, LBJ) shaping their times by force of will, for good or ill, when war and domestic upheaval shook the country's foundation. Those remarkable men had Lincoln's leadership for their template, and her \\"Team of Rivals\\" is a thorough, moving tribute to a man who stepped precisely and perfectly into his time to lead. Absolutely essential for anyone interested in the Civil War, 19th century America, its most important figure of that century - or of America's 230 years.ts most important figure of that century - or of America's 230 years.  <br /> <br />
6305313687|5.0|Foremost, the controversy: the film's director Tony Kaye desperately tried divorced himself from this work when he realized that he would not be able to release the film under a false-name. Though he claims that Edward Norton edited the film to allot himself more screen time, most believe there is something deeper at work here.    Equally as interesting: this film's script-ending is dramatically different from the end-product. To avoid spoilers, check the bottom of IMDB's trivia for this film for the shocking details!! (Though this conclusion is alluded to in the actual film-ending, it is made blatant in the script).     If for some strange reason \\"Fight Club,\\" \\"Red Dragon,\\" \\"Death to Smoochy,\\" and \\"Primal Fear\\" did not convince you that Norton has TREMENDOUS range, this film will. Not only did Norton physically transform himself for this role by gaining THIRTY pounds of muscle, he mentally accessed the very dark place where hatred resides. His character is all-too-believable. A credit to his talent, indeed!!    Those who find this film only reinforces stereotypes seem to miss how the film portrays the both the irrationality of racism and its insidious nature. This is especially evident in the character of Seth. That fact the Seth refuses to eat a black jellybean because of its color paints a pretty clear picture. On the other hand, the film does not hesitate to show the viewer that many members of hate groups are intellectually gifted: like Derek and Danny. Circumstance has pushed these young men to seek a new father figure, and they find comfort in the attention provided by Cameron (leader of the fictional D.O.C. or Disciples of Christ). Chilling!    Several people here claim the black-and-white scenes are \\"artsy.\\" Entirely untrue. They have a very clear purpose: they exist simply to indicate \\"the past.\\" (It is a common film-device. . . as nearly all of you reading this know). In no way does this detract from the film. In fact, it makes several graphic scenes moretolerable.    If you are interested in film art, keep an eye on the use of the sea ... and pay specific attention to the diner-scene (near the conclusion) where Norton stands in front of a sea-scape painting . . . his head engulfed in the waves. That which was once so alive becomes frozen in time. (Read into it what you will!)    Though there are some sexually explicit scenes, it is a great film for a college classroom or for a very mature teenager (though, if I were a parent, I would not want to watch it WITH my child). Some see the work as heavy-handed . . . I think it is quite real.     A must-see for any Norton fan or anyone interested in human-behavior.    Suggested Reading: Roth, Luanne. \\"Beyond Communitas: Cinematic Food Events and the Negotiation of Power, Belonging, and Exclusion.\\" Western Folklore 64, no. 3-4 (2005 Fall): 163-87. (This article addresses the role of the family-dinner table and the role of food in general in the films American History X and American Beauty.)

The music is great but is almost 40 years behind the setting of the film  (e.g. Rolling Stones \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band's \\"Well Well Well\\".)<br /><br />Overall, it's a great mob movie.  It might be heresy to say this, but I liked it almost as much -- in some ways more -- than Goodfellas.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Oh baby! That's what I'm talking about. Hilarious, original, and super cool! The 80's produced some classic gems during its time, and this one (IMO) tops them all!<br /><br />I loved this film  so much as a kid. Even as an adult, I still enjoy watching it. I believe it's great family entertainment--more so than the current lackluster offerings from Disney and digitally animated Pixel films. It contains a solid plot, excellent acting, smart script, fantastic visuals, and an abundance of your favorite LOONEY toons! There are cameo appearances from a colorful array of beloved cartoon characters (Bugs, Mickey, Betty Boop, Daffy, Donald, etc.).<br /><br />Film includes an extraordinary cast of actors: Charles Fleischer (the voice over of Roger Rabbit, Benny the Cab, Greasy, and Psycho), Bob Hoskins (Detective Valiant), Christopher Lloyd (Judge Doom), Kathleen Turner (Jessica Rabbit), the legendary voice artists of Mel Blanc (aka \\"The Man of a Thousand Voices\\" who does Bugs, Daffy, Tweety, Porky, and Sylvester) and Mae Questel (who does Betty Boop!), just to name a few....<br /><br />Do expect plenty of laughs and the wonderful added mystery and suspense! Although I do recommend this as a family film, I'd advise parents to watch out for the following: some cursing, a \\"dip-kill\\" of a toon, and most especially--the icky and frightful ending of Judge Doom! It's super scary (as a kid I would always hide under a pillow during that part) and not for the very young to see.<br /><br />Yet don't miss it. It's a landmark film--a classic in every sense--rekindling the Golden Age of American animation.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I watched this DVD upon the strong and continual recommendation of my best female friend who said that this was a sad movie of the American Beauty type. Surprisingly, I found it hilarious and to a limited degree, meaningful:- Despite the personal problems of individual family members (who in this world doesnt have a problem?), each of them loves and supports each other through various hurdles, making the family tie stronger in the end. Old fashioned and cliche, right? However, the excellent performance of the cast (you know their faces but not their names class, my apology), the marvelous screenplay and the outstanding directing/editing skills of the crew further manifested by the four endings (with commentaries) included as bonus feature in the DVD made it so warm, real and trustworthy. Sorry that the many Oscar Nominations had devalued it, artistically speaking. Nevertheless, a very entertaining movie not to be missed!
B00005JOCU|5.0|I've seen both the play and the movie, and Bill Condon's pulling off this cinematic translation was artistry of the highest order. What a completely enthralling movie, visually, dramatically, musically- I was enormously moved. Too bad it didn't get the Oscar accolades it so deserved.
0793518326|5.0|Prior to 2006, how many rock groups in the world published a complete score of every song they recorded?  Zero, people!  Zero!!!  This is like the microwave oven or the Internet!  If you want to improve as a classic rock musician, you must have this.  It's as simple as that.  The book states clearly that a lot of time and trouble went into making these transcriptions as accurate as possible.  Now, first of all, you may not realize what the term 'complete score' means.  This is not a fakebook, which would be just one line of music, with chords and words.  This gives you the exact notes that each member of the band would play and sing for that song -- as recorded.  So the amount of information for each song is extensive, and includes vocal harmonies, both guitars, and drums, plus any special tracks that were extra.  And guitar parts include tablature (Bass and regular guitar!).  And it has chord notations!  I play bass guitar and have worked out about six songs so far.  The music is absolutely accurate, but the tablature, while technically giving the correct note, was not notated by a person who plays the instrument (e.g. eighth notes going from 3rd to 7th fret).  But one can figure out the better ways to play each piece as you practice it.  Also, the musical layouts are too small to read easily while practicing, so I make working copies with just the bass parts using Finale Notepad music software.  Also please realize the greater implications of the term 'as recorded'.  The amazing thing is, you can practice with a Beatles CD until you can play indistinguishably from the record.  So even if you're not crazy about the Beatles, the genius of their compositions is now totally accessible.  All of them!!  It would take years to get all the benefit in achievable musicality that is available right at my fingertips.  I just turn on the stereo and play note for note with Paul McCartney now.  I wonder if you can imagine what an intense high that is for a guy who grew up in the60's.  If you are an aspiring classic rock musician, this is the bargain of a lifetime.  If I want an accurate transcription of most rock songs, I have to make it myself from the music, listening carefully and copying note by note to music over hours and hours.  With this book, that step is eliminated.
B000001GX5|5.0|I love the Pines of Rome and find this version to be the next best after my other benchmark, Reiner's interpretation with the Chicago Symphony in the 60's. Too many conductors feel the need for excessive speed in the opening of this piece, causing it to feel hurried and rushed rather than triumphant. Karjan and Reiner are able to reign in this tendency. The playing is immaculate as well. This is an essential recording of this piece. Buy it.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|OH, MY GOSH!     <br /> <br />Mr. Rochester (according to Toby Stephens).  I have a few descriptives: <br /> <br />sigh..........swoon.........druel. <br /> <br />Call me a hopeless romantic, but I just had to order this DVD because this is a KEEPER!  I won't be nitpicky about any such flaws because I see this as a beautiful adaptation--great scenery, great performances. <br /> <br />I agree that Toby Stephens is technically too handsome to play what is supposed to be a homely Mr. Rochester---but really---who cares!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />\\"Am I handsome?\\" Rochester asks.  \\"No\\", Jane replies.  What? Are they kidding?  Toby Stephens (darker make-up and all) is gorgeous(and I bet he knows it, too).  Lucky Ruth.  I wonder if she had a bit of an actor's crush during the making of it all. <br /> <br />Ruth Wilson's Jane says that she is \\"little\\", but standing next to Toby, she doesn't appear that little to me...but again...who cares.  I think the actress is not too plain and not too pretty, so she seems to be an alright fit for the role. <br /> <br />I think the two main actors have great chemistry together, and I will love to watch this in its entirety...more than once. <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I was blown away at the original story and its crafting. And the acting, direction and other elements, such as music and visual touches, all rose to the level this work deserved. The gentle way the satire rolled out was a welcome change from the more pointed mockery, exaggerated caricture, and heavy-handed outrageousnous that is more typical of satirical films today.  The masterful writing astonished me. That said, I think \\"Dreamgirls\\" is more deserving of a Best Pic nomination and after viewing this film that was one of my first reactions. \\"Sunshine\\" though  seems to have elicited praises from people in a way that \\"Dreamgirls\\" didn't. Perhaps we're less inclined to escapism-type entertainment at this time in our country. Maybe \\"Sunshine\\" struck a bigger chord because it referenced so many of our societal shortcomings at this time:the emptiness, interpersonal isolation, consumerism, hypocrisy, lack of self-awareness & self-reflection, displaced values, shallow striving, etc. Still, for all \\"Sunshine\\"'s accomplishments,its depth and graceful complexity, I still think between the two \\"Dreamgirls\\" should have placed in the Best Pic category. It may seem I'm mixing apples and oranges here but reflecting on the above was part of my immediate apres-view experience.
B000002KMY|5.0|Despite the acclaim of 'Heaven and Hell' I was -- apart from the title track -- mildly impressed. Nothing to argue with the musicianship, but it was altogether too polished and commercial for my taste. 'Mob Rules' is a true return to form. \\"Doom\\"ier, \\"blues\\"ier, flat out metal. I had always favored Ozzy but Dio really held his own on this album. Highly recommended.
0330345052|2.0|There's not much to say in reviewing the Modigliani Scandal, an early Follett novel published before he hit it big with the World War II thriller \\"Eye of the Needle.\\"  In a forward for the version I read, Follett acknowledges that this little story about art dealers, artists and thieves in London doesn't have much depth.  Still, it is fun to read and to see traces of the greatness that is to come.  There really aren't any main characters, just a bunch of story lines that all merge together in the end.  The plot concerns the chase for a rare painting by a famous Italian artist, Modigliani.  The plot also follows a Lucian Black as he tries to open his own art gallery.  The book is short and easy to read, and if you're a Follett fan, I recommend you read this, but I don't think I'd recommend that you pay money for it.  It's just not that good of a book.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I guess every love story has begun like this. And every good love story must include some anger and passion , and some I love you-I hate you feelings now and then.  Mine REALLY begins in March, 1989.   I was really down because of some non-important stuff. In a Mexican tv-show, the host introduced the new Madonna's video to the crowd, LIKE A PRAYER.  Now I can see this in retrospective, it was a life-changing experience for me.  By then, I couldn't know I would be sitting here, almost 20 years later February the 4th 2007, writing about one of my main sources of inspiration in every sense of the word: Madonna.  Should be fair to say, no controversy along the way, no burning cross, no SEX book or Erotica album, or how many millions she spends putting out her shows, would be important enough, if she wouldn't make the music she does.    LADY MADONNA has managed herself to do what every great artist (from Picasso to Beethoven, from John Lennon to Roman Polanski) must do: not only entertain (and she is damn good at it) but to touch you and MAKE YOU THINK in every way possible: whether on the dance floor or in every second you spend listening and watching to her body of work.    I have the feeling she is always concentrate on the present/future (she has even said that in some interviews). But the rest of us are grateful  that tapes, videos and discs are available to show us in form of music her vision, points of view, and what her personal freedom of expression has led her to: to become the greatest female artist of all the time....  When times goes by, the new generations will be speaking of the legendary Madonna, as we did with Mozart, for example. We heard the music of Mozart and we can do nothing but  thank GOD there was a man capable to create such beautiful and wonderful music.  I can picture from now on 200 years, young kids doing the same thing listening to GET TOGETHER, THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND, TAKE A BOW, LIVE TO TELL, LIKE A VIRGIN, PROMISE TO TRY, EASY RIDE, HUNG UP, LIKE A PRAYER, CRAZY FOR YOU, XTATIC PROCESS, NOTHING FAILS, RAIN, VOGUE, EXPRESS YOURSELF, SECRET OR FORBIDDEN LOVE...New Generations searching and trying to find out the whole Madonna story, maybe part of a School home work called \\"ICONS OF POPULAR MUSIC AND ARTS, 20th & 21th Centuries; or maybe just for the sake of knowing who is the Legendary Diva Suprema, Madonna.    MADONNA has broke every boundary and changed every rule around her, like no woman in music business since or before: Now you can't say you can't look hip and young at 50.   Now, no one is able to say women have to surrender themselves to a world dominated by men.  Sex and scandal has been part of the legend, of course. But critics would be surprised to learn that with no scandal at all, Ray of Light earned 5 grammys, sold 17 millions around the world, and showed to a completely new fan database the improved Madonna... Of course, you can say the same about Music, or Confessions on a Dance Floor.  But what critics and detractors fail to realize, is that it's has been always about the music. Always.    I am not alone on this. I fell in love the first time I heard Take a Bow. I have cried and smiled listening to I'll Remember (right now I'm doin' it) and Rain... Great times I've had dancing to Music, Vogue, Into the Groove and Hung Up in Cabo San Lucas, Cancun or Puerto Vallarta's hottest places and clubs.  And when everything seemed to be said and done... Get Together, Future Lovers and Forbidden Love saw the light for the first time in November 2005.    When I was 12, I used to listen to lots of instrumental and very quiet-soft music. I felt proud of it and still like it. But if someone woul've told me  I would be using a tecno-trance-disco-pop track like \\"Get Together\\" as my meditation background-groove in my early 30's, I would have laughed out loud like crazy!!!.    AND NOW THE CONFESSIONS TOUR CD/DVD IS OUT  What else has to be said???  I have played now this dvd more than 10 times... Again, I cried to \\"Live to Tell\\", I dreamed about another time and space watching Get Together Live... I had fun with Like a Virgin, Hung Up, La Isla Bonita and Music...Perfect show for a perfect album.  MADONNA IS UNIQUE. AND I AM SURE THERE ARE STILL YEARS OF FUN AND GOOD MUSIC TO COME!!! THE POSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS....AND SHE HAS PROVED THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN...  WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT MADONNA BACK IN 1985, IS EVEN TRUER NOW:  SHE IS UNIQUE. AMEN.
B0002IQJUK|4.0|Follow Through - 4.25 stars. I love this song. It's so innocent.<br /><br />Chariot - 4.5 stars. We've all heard this one a million times. I think it's a stronger song than Follow Through but they're both good.<br /><br />Just Friends - 3.5 stars. This song is weaker than the 2 previous tracks. It has alright lyrics though.<br /><br />(Nice to Meet You) Anyway - 3.75 stars. Stronger than Just Friends, weaker than Follow Through. It makes for a decent song though.<br /><br />Chemical Party - 3.5 stars. This is a good song. It speaks about a girl who has fun at a party and enjoys everyone but Gavin. He's drunk and she is high...too high to realize him.<br /><br />Belief - 5 stars. This song is kind of weird. I don't really know much about it besides some person defended and captured Gavin's heart...But the lyrics: \\"When you came to my defense/With a knife/In the shape of your mouth/In the form of your body...\\" doesn't make too much sense to me. I do like the ending though.<br /><br />Crush - 4 stars. Thank you, Gavin. You delivered another strong track. I love the composition of this song. Once again, good job!<br /><br />I Don't Want to Be - 4.25 stars. Gavin's first single. It's a great one at that. Gives off a good message.<br /><br />Meaning - 3 stars. This song doesn't really do much for me...it's skip-able.<br /><br />More Than Anyone - 3.25 stars. This song is a step up from Meaning but that's not saying much. It really drags on...<br /><br />Over-rated - 4 stars. This song gets a higher score than some because I really like the lyrics.<br /><br />The average is 4.20454545454545.<br /><br />4.2/5<br /><br />Final Grade: 4.2 stars.<br /><br />P.S. didn't really liked the actual stripped CD with the bonus remake track because the arrangements changed, and became less memorable. I haven't listened to it since.<br /><br />February 27, 2008: Much better (the main CD) these days. None are skip-able, Meaning and Belief are now in my top 3 favorite songs by this talent...

0393061434|4.0|It is so nice to see the real story. It sounded just like Steve, the engineer, telling it.  <br /> <br />I respect Steve Jobs and his achievements enormously. He has the pulse of the market, and insists on style. But his forté is getting  people to do the things he wants, not doing the engineering himself. I was well aware that Steve (Woz) had designed the Apple I & II, and was irked when so many people said that Steve Jobs had designed them. Of course, as an engineer, I tend to think of designing the guts of the thing, but packaging, presentation and marketting do have an important role to play. <br /> <br />Steve and I worked on calculators at the same time, for HP, and shared circuits. It was interesting to hear some of the names of people I have not thought about in years. <br /> <br />I liked a paragraph near the end of the book where Steve expresses that the best engineers are artists. If you look at architecture, the engineering is very obviously art (except for some horribly utilitarian buildings, like the Russian apartment blocks). But it is true in electronics too, although not so readily apparent to the non-techie.  <br /> <br />I totally agree that it is much better to do everything oneself. At Apple I would work at home in the mornings, because there were too many interruptions at Apple. Then I would work at Apple in the evening when most of the interrupters had gone home. Apple unfortunately became \\"big company\\", and huge amounts of time were wasted on project team meetings and staff meetings. Often more time was lost by many people being in a conference room for half a day than was gained but the supposedly improved communication. A loner only has to communicate with himself, and is responsible for everything. <br /> <br />I would have liked a little less repetition in the book, and a little more detail, but it came out as exactly what it was: a conversational series of reminiscences from the man who designed the electronics of the first mass marketcomputer to use a domestic TV display.
B000HIVO64|2.0|What made early Beck so compelling was his word pairings \\"Misery waits in vague hotels to be evicted\\" (Tropicalia); \\"I've been looking for my shadow but this place is so bright and so clean\\" (O Maria). These were not just odd and arresting juxtapositions. They conveyed a sense a beautiful sadness Beck appears to have abandoned. I find this album to be an excercise (as in tired) in self-indulgence. Yes, the instrumentation, overlays and influences are interesting, but there's just no real feeling. Call it what you will, to be it is overlayering at the expense of substance. I'm not a big fan of Guero, but this album doesn't have anything close to the hooks of \\"Girl\\" or \\"e-Pro\\". The more promising hooks appear to be quickly abandoned. <br />
B0000669JL|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I have had this CD once before and it was stolen! Yea, it was stolen!!!! I will never let it out of my site again!!
B00005AWMF|5.0|This CD \\"The Best Of Sade\\" is exactly what it's title says - it is the best. With hits songs such as Your Love is King, Is it a Crime, Smooth Operator, and No Ordinary Love. There are a lot of Best Of's CD's but none of them ever have all of the best songs from that artist like Sade's CD does. It is a wonderful CD to listen to whether your just chillin' at home or on the road. Sade's captivating voice is one in a million. So if you love Sade or any of the songs that she's sung, YOU will love this CD. I rate it THE BEST!!!
B00005JPGO|5.0|Leo is only in his early thirties and has the potential to be the best actor of his generation. The Departed and Blood Diamond offer two very different, yet brilliant performances by Leonardo DiCaprio (though I do think he deserved the Oscar nomination for The Departed). Djimon Hounsou is great as well and deserved the Oscar nomination he got for his role here. The movie itself is more than just an action film, providing some food for thought. It is also paced rather well. What else would you expect from the director who brought us Glory and The Last Samurai?
0451528956|4.0|What would you do if you could drink an elixir that removes all guilt from your mind for a few hours and allows you to partake in things that you normally would never dream of?  Robert Louis Stevenson gives us a glimpse of what could happen in \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"  It's a wonderful classic originally published in 1886.  In it, the well-worn battle between good and evil is played out not in the forms of a hero and a villain, but inside the mind and soul of one man who toys with the idea of acting out his most carnal (at least that's what the reader assumes) longings.<br /><br />This isn't your cookie-cutter Hollywood version of \\"Jekyll and Hyde.\\"  It's a much deeper study of the human soul and it's longing to be a bit \\"naughty\\" and suffer none of the consequences.  Time and again, Jekyll drinks his \\"liquid courage\\" and unleashes the evil that lies within.  As the days, weeks and months pass by, Jekyll finds it harder to control the beast within, and his unholy friend makes more and longer appearances.  Eventually, Mr. Hyde goes too far on one of his escapades, and it drives Jekyll to the brink of sanity.<br /><br />Along the way, we are introduced to characters such as Utterson and his friend Enfield.  We also meet Poole, Dr. Lanyon, and in a brief appearance, a maid servant who witnesses actions against one Mr. Carew.  Although Jekyll and Hyde are the title characters, most of the book's focus is placed on Utterson.  Jekyll gets one chapter (the final one) in which to give his account of what happens to him as he undergoes his changes.<br /><br />Most of the films and plays based on this book portray the doctor as a good, wholesome man.  However, while reading this book, I found that he was perhaps more evil than Hyde.  He is capable of controlling his desires.  Hyde is not.  Instead of prohibiting himself from taking more of the elixir, Jekyll openly enjoys it.  As he begins to lose more and more control of his situation, he attempts to correct his own wrongdoing.  When this occurs, we find the one thing that Hyde fears.<br /><br />This particular edition of \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" features a rather humdrum introductory essay by Vladimir Nabokov.  In my opinion, he goes to depths that Stevenson probably never meant to be uncovered in his morality tale.  Skip the introduction if you are unfamiliar with the story.  It will do nothing more than spoil your read.  I do recommend the afterword by Dan Chaon.  It's a much more interesting, less in depth look at this brief, wonderful story.<br /><br />I highly recommend the tale.  It gets five stars, but the introductory essay drags the story down and makes it almost boring.  Therefore, I give this version of \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" four stars.own wrongdoing.

B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's Mulholland Drive deserves ten stars, because he is the closest film artist to the likes of the great Luis Bunuel I have ever seen. Not to mention the acting genius Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the leading roles with Justin Theroux et al. Simply put, this is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece for all time. Lynch explored some of the surrealistic tecniques is his amazing, early 1970s masterpiece Eraserhead.     While playing upon the audience's sense of time, Lynch often, and with no warning, removes all defined space. Lynch, in Mulholland Drive, combines the best in film history--vis-a-vis Bunuel, Dahli, Kubrick, Hitchcock, some Felliniesque and also with an homage to Ingmar Bergman (Persona), and even some Victor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz) moments as well--to create a cinematic splendor that is unsurpassed by any living filmmaker.    \\"No Hay Banda,\\" indeed, because what we wish to see, live and hear is not necessarily what we experience, except in our imaginations that are unlocked--not just by a royal-blue key left on a coffee table-- by suspending disbelief while still holding onto the seat of your (intellectual) pants.     What exactly happened at Mulholland Drive: this is a puzzle that Lynch presents, a gift of magnificent proportions. Mulholland Drive is for people that like to sit and think constantly, but anyone can enter the world of Mulholland Drive like Alice through the Looking Glass (and there are traces of the great writer-artist-logician Lewis Carroll here, as well, to be sure).    Lynch the magician, Lynch the artist extraordinaire, Lynch's Mulholland Drive will take you to the depths and heights of the human soul, and then some.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|This Kid is going to be HUGE!!! I ordered this album after hearing only the designated single, \\"New Shoes\\", on the Today show.  Just that snippet told me that the rest of this CD was going to be great, and it does not disappoint.  If he is putting out this kind of quality at 19, I can't wait to see how his music and delivery evolve as he matures. BRAVO! I definitely see his star rising!!!
0451450523|5.0|Forget the myriad B-fantasy novels with bodice-ripping elf maidens on the covers.  This is book is where the real magic is. <br />Others have covered the plot admirably, so I'll be brief.  The Last Unicorn is (oddly enough!) a book about one of the fabled beasts who discovers one day that she is the last of her kind. (A truly distressing thought). Determined to find the rest of her kin, she sets off on a quest (I hate using that phrase; sounds so cliche).  Along the way, she is accompanied by two amusingly atypical friends.  The journey ends at the castle of bitter King Haggard, where the unicorn discovers more than she could have ever imagined about herself and her people. <br />Interesting plot aside, this novel is simply gorgeous.  It is lyrical, lush, hilarious, heartbreaking, sometimes all at the same time.  For those who like their novels with some morality, there are themes of friendship and self-knowledge. But perhaps most important, it makes you remember unicorns once again. <br />What do I mean by this? There is a scene in the early pages of the book in which a farmer attempts to catch the roving unicorn, believing her to be nothing more than a common white mare.  An exceptionally pretty one, but a horse nonetheless. And therein lies the real tragedy of this novel: People have forgotten magic to such a degree that they no longer recognize it, even when it gallops right before their eyes in all its glory. <br />The world would be better off with a few more unicorns.  Read this novel, and it just may restore your faith that maybe there are some, still dwelling somewhere in a lilac wood. . . .
0307341542|5.0|This was such a great book.  The character is a flawed sympathetic heroine.  Sometimes her choice of words is shocking.  Her hometown and family are creepy.  The ending is so surprising that I was repeatedly saying out loud, \\"Oh my gosh, no way!\\"  I can't wait for her next book!!!
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I recently purchased this cd even though it wasn't well reviewed in this article. I own all of Norah Jones cds and listen to them frequently.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the new cd, its her style and very comforting to listen to.

B000HEVZ8K|5.0|I am new to this film and thought I would watch it based on it's highly respected reputation in film and that it is considered a classic. I was not disappointed. The film is very enganging, and I am not a big western fan. But the story, acting and cinematography are top notch. The visuals are stunning. The landscape is a character here and wonderfully shot. I was amazed at the hd quality of this film shot about 50 years ago. I don't think I have seen a film that is quite this beautiful including contemporary films. There is something to be said for Vista Vision and Technicolor. But with all that stated, the story is quite engaging, and the journey that the characters take really give a feel for the old west and that culture.The relationship between John Wayne's and Jeffery Hunter's character is interesting as it unfolds and the Hunter character begins to mature. Get this HD-DVD.
B000E1MTY0|4.0|1. Picture transfer - 8 (1/10)<br /><br />2. Sound transfer  - 8 (1/10)<br /><br />3. Movie Content  - 8 (1/10)<br /><br />This was, in my opinion, the best of all of the Batman series. The action was far more believable and the fighting scenes were much more true to life - sloppy and random with pushing and rolling. The scenes and/or locations had a good range from dank and droopy city shots to bright and gorgeous mountain range footage. I rate this movie a solid 8, which to me means I am glad I bought it, but yes there is better. For the price however I would say that this disc is exactly as advertised, a good first HD DVD to own.<br /><br />PS. Take my advice the only way to win a war is to recieve benefit from both sides victories (ala Switzerland). If you have the money purchase both an HD and a Blu-ray and let them out do each other. If you must purchase one I would go with the Blue-Ray, - much more stable platform(Toshiba dominates the HD DVD market and my experience is that Toshibas are very unstable, regardless of firmware) and anyone who says that one has a way better picture or sound is either lying or is trying to compare apples to oranges(different movies cannot be compared). Also be very carefull when you buy a Blu-ray player, I would wager that all pretty much supply the same quality picture, but alot of companies have extra sound options, such as Dolby True HD or Digital Plus, as well as DTS HD. Now all of these names sound cool but in reality all you need is an uncompressed PCM sound track. I bought a Samsung as compared to a Sony because of the price difference and I'll never care or think twice about some of the sound \\"options\\" I \\"passed on\\".

Just know that you can enjoy the movie even if you're not a big Dicaprio buff. Even if you despise him, you'll still love this flick. The final scene had everyone in the theatre yelling \\"woah\\"!
0440418569|1.0|As a huge fantasy and sci-fi fan, I looked forward to reading this series after seeing all the glowing reviews. I quickly realized after reading just a short way into the first book that the author had a deep issue with religion. The only other impression I had was boring, boring, boring. I kept waiting for the wonderful story to arrive. I resolutely started the second book, hoping I was wrong in my initial reaction and the author didn't truly hate religion and God. Well, guess what? He does. Not only does he blast the church and present members of the clergy as murderous villains, he introduces homosexual angels and informs the reader there is no God, just one angel who took control. Feeling like I had to finish the series in case the author changed the point of view, I struggled on. The third book jumps all over the place and I was left feeling dirty from having read this garbage. It went straight to the trash, something that I never do to books. However, as a Christian parent I am appalled that these books are being touted as excellent children's books.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This absolutely charming video has long been a favorite of mine.  Family members and friends who have received & viewed it are aslo overwhelmingly delighted.  It tells a story yet opens up the child's (or adult's) imagination.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.
B000HIVQBC|2.0|First off, the main reason I have purchased all of these Depeche Mode special editions is primarily for the 5.1 surround mix.  Being a huge fan of Depeche Mode and surround-sound music in general, the idea of remixing their music for this format seemed like a natural fit.  And one listen to Violator proves that point beyond a reasonable doubt.  I also appreciate the care that went into producing each set - with bonus tracks, videos, documentaries, etc.  These definitely feel like truly special editions, unlike other sets where you get one disc with a cd on one side and dvd on the other.  As a side note, I have to agree with Bob from LA - there is NO reason the bonus tracks should only be available on the DVD, but I wouldn't go so far as to suggest a multi-channel, dvd-only edition. <br /> <br />Anyway, getting back to SOFAD, my primary complaint with this set is that the 5.1 mix is completely off.  After being blown away by the surround mixes for Violator, MFTM, and Some Great Reward, I had high expectations for this set as SOFAD is my favorite DM album.  Unfortunately, whoever worked on this project (Alan Wilder?) either rushed through the project or was asleep at the mixing board.  The bass on the opening track itself should be very deep and present, but instead, the whole song seems to get lost in the top end with very little midrange or subwoofer presence.  There isn't much difference in the remaining tracks, again as if the idea of surround was an afterthought.  I could go on, but this is sadly just a lost opportunity.  Let's hope they don't miss the boat with Ultra.

B0000042HV|5.0|There are perhaps several complete Shostakovich cycles one would like to own for these amazing pieces, and this is one of them. Not every single quartet is perfect, but that is to be expected. What these players excel in is an emotional depth that is perhaps left behind in the sheer brilliance of the Emerson SQ's playing. <br /> <br />Their tempi are excellent: fast when necessary, and painfully slow where Shostakovich asks for it. Perhaps my favorite point of their playing is the articulation, which is broader than most recordings I hear. Typically, they only play short when asked to in the score, and I think this sounds better than, for instance, if the opening of the Fifth Quartet, a work of enormous gravity and passion, is taken lightly. <br /> <br />Get this one. Highly recommended.

B000I0RNV6|5.0|If you have ever REALLY been in love, or wanted to be, you will relate like a bulls-eye to this film. I can't think of one thing that could be changed to improve this movie, and I can't say that about any other film.<br /><br />The devotion of a mother to a husband lost in war, a little boy to an art and to the provider of that art. A town to the images from a far off and very different world. Then this little boy becomes a man constantly looking for the devotion from a woman, that ideal love he discovers from collecting film edits over many years. In life, he can only find love and devotion in the images on a screen.<br /><br />There is great joy and great regret, the director and writer play your emotions like a drum.<br /><br />Don't miss this, buy it, give it to people you love or to someone who needs to understand the difference between love and simple lust or infatuation. You laugh and you cry, I'm a guy hardened by the bumps in life and it brought tears streaming down my face. Get this, I have a number of different copies, but on Super Bowl Sunday, it was shown on TCM, and I found myself unable to turn the channel to the game, it's that special and engrossing.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />Steve<br /><br />Gilbert, AZ
B000JLTRKE|4.0|Enjoyed this movie very much...if you are expecting a lot of ugly scene-the ones in this movie are not hard to take-someone younger could watch this movie.This movie  is more of a personal journey between two men and their families--you feel the pain from both sides-yet you also feel their hope and courage.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I always did think that Superman II was a little better than Superman just because it had a more compelling story, but there were always things in it that drove me nuts too.  I hated the way that the Kryptonian villans, in several scenes, seemed to be more like clowns than intimidating enemies (especially the big guy who was always making those whiny sounds as though he were a lost little puppy).  In Donner's version they become what they should: much more frightening.  I always hated that Lester seemed to get a kick out of inventing new powers for these characters, like the levitation beam they shoot out of their fingers, or Superman tossing the \\"S\\" on his costume like a net that evaporates after a few seconds.  I also thought it was a ridiculous touch to have the villans deface Mt. Rushmore by beaming their own faces over the originals, a move that would seem more at home in a Monty Python movie rather than a Superman movie.  Lester does a similar move in III when evil Superman displays just how evil he is by straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa (EVIL!!!).  The epic final battle was made less epic with Lester \\"funny\\" little interlodes, and to top it off I didn't really like the magic kiss either.  Anyhow,Donner removes all of those issues for me in his version, in addition to creating a more emotionally resonate overall story by putting the Brando footage back in, which both makes it more consistent with the first film, and strenghens the father-son relationship started in the first film.  As far as I'm concerning this is the definitive version of Superman II.  I own Lester's version, but when I sit down to watch the superman series (minus the crappy movies) the order is going to be Superman, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, and Superman Returns.  The others I plan to save for times when I just feel like playing Mystery Science Theater 3000 with a bad movie.

6304708491|5.0|The Beatles score a coup with their film entitled \\"Help!\\" Some people write that this movie is a spoof of James Bond films; and they are right. The antics and music set it very far apart from any James Bond movie. The soundtrack to this movie positively shines! It includes the title track and \\"You're Gonna Lose That Girl;\\" \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away;\\" \\"She's A Woman\\" and \\"Ticket To Ride.\\" The cinematography is especially well done for the musical numbers.<br /><br />The plot, as you may know, centers on a special ring that Ringo possesses; Ringo wants the ring but so do the members of an Eastern religious cult who need the ring for a ritual sacrifice. The members of the religious cult attempt to kill Ringo many times but never succeed. In addition, a mad British scientist also develops a keen interest in the ring. The crazy scientist character enhances the comedic value of this picture.<br /><br />In a successful attempt to make the film even more unusual in a funny sort of way, the Fab Four enlist the help of Scotland Yard to protect Ringo and the other three members of the band. The attempts on Ringo's life so that the religious group or the mad scientist can obtain the ring are exaggerated even further for comedic effect with the not so brilliant \\"services\\" of Scotland Yard.<br /><br />The cinematography's strength shines in the scenes filmed in the Austrian Alps and the island of Nassau in The Bahamas. You get impressive shots of the countryside and the seashore, respectively.<br /><br />Amazon notes that there is \\"relentless nonsense\\" in this movie; and I strongly agree. The Fab Four go through a lot to protect Ringo and stay together: Paul is at one point shrunk to the size of a chewing gum wrapper; the religious cult tries to kill them countless times but never succeeds and John has to fish out a season ticket from some soup he is eating. Ringo and his band mates enjoy a happy ending but I won't write anything specific that could spoil it for you. The picture boasts a bizarre finish that complements the outrageous antics throughout \\"Help!\\"<br /><br />The quality of the sound is excellent and the witty dialogue will amuse you. I especially like the scene in which Ringo must whistle parts of Beethoven's ninth symphony in order to tame a tiger that could kill him so that the members of the religious group could finally obtain the ring.<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD for fans of The Beatles. People who enjoy spoofs of famous types of movies including the James Bond genre will love this movie.or you.

055358202X|4.0|My mistake was that I didn't go back and reread the previous book before jumping into this one.  It took me quite a while to remember how each character got where he or she was when the book began - even then I might have gotten one wrong.<br /><br />Martin combines classic medieval fantasy elements without relying on magic and monsters to carry the story. The characters (the women especially) are tinged with modernity but still act in a believable way for their milieu.  Interestingly, now that we are in the fourth book of the series, the male characters have suffered more attrition than the female characters (chivalry is impaired in war, but not dead) so this book was more female dominated.  The next book may continue this trend since the possible Queen of the whole land was offstage for this whole book and her story will be a major thread in the next book.<br /><br />As the war continues, allegiances are fluid but the body count keeps increasing, making the title of this book apt.  This book felt grimmer than the previous books as winter settles in and the social fabric of the continent continues to unravel.  I am a little worried that I am committing to a Thomas Covenant situation (where new sympathetic characters are introduced in each book, to be horribly or casually killed as the story unfolds) but I am cautiously trusting in Martin's storytelling ability and ready to continue the journey into book five and beyond.<br /><br />Please, George RR Martin, put a synopsis in the front of the next one.  If Tolkien can do it, you can too.
0743243307|5.0|This book is about the immigrant experience, and to a smaller (and perhaps unintended) extent, also a very compassionate study of adultery. A Bangladeshi woman is transplanted into Brick lane following her marriage. She brings with her the South Asian beliefs of \\"accepting\\" what happens to you, and so must win small everyday battles to assert her identity. The ultimate showdown happens when her husband Chanu decides to move back to Bangladesh- now Nazneen must choose between creating a future for herself and her children or accepting whatever is fated for her. Ali scores in this slow motion study of Nazneen's liberation, and her family's struggles and dreams.     I only wished it was a 100 pages shorter. Omitting several of Chanu's discourses, as well as the boring narrations of the meetings of the Bengal Tigers would have made the book much more intense.
B000009HF2|5.0|It was great on LP when I bought it in the 70's and even better now on CD.
B000K7VHSM|5.0|While everyone could learn something from this movie, it may not be for everyone. It certainly doesn't run in the traditional \\"it all works out in the end\\" mill of Hollywood films. What you take away from it depends largely on your personal views. If the thought of two men loving each other disgusts you, you should probably skip this one and instead choose the Unforgiven HD-DVD to get your cowboy fix.  The film follows the story of two young men, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, who meet working as sheep herders on rugged Brokeback Mtn in Wyoming in 1963.  The two men quickly bond while they depend on each other to uphold their tough job responsibilities.  One drunken night Jack makes a sexual advance on Ennis and the reprocussions from that event sweep over the next two decades after the men come down off the mountain and go their separate ways.  Later they rekindle their relationship despite their seemingly heterosexual lives. Jack pushes for a more substantial relationship but Ennis' surplus repression prevents him from imagining a good life living with the person he loves, another man. While there is alot of serious subject matter at hand, director Ang Lee does a great job mixing up tension you will feel with great and sometimes subtle moments of comedy. The great story and scenery are backed up by top notch acting from all corners. <br /> <br />   The HD-DVD release is by far the best way to experience this movie.  The cinematography is a joy to watch even though you're looking at Canada mostly and not Wyoming is still is a gorgeous film.  I was blown away by the color and detail.  Frankly, it looked better on my TV than it did projected in the theatre.   <br /> <br />   Sure people are going to diss this movie over and over because of the \\"gay theme\\".  If you are not gay but compassionate about the rights that gay people fight for all over the world in terms of acceptance and equality then you may really like this film. Yes it deals with very controversial issues; This is not Leave it to Beaver folks. Traditional ideas about sexuality are blown away. It is because of a deep repression, not the flaws of the characters, that everyone loses here. In a sense this movie mirrors a great love story like Romeo and Juliet. But characters like Ennis and Jack and their situations are very realistic, even in today's so called liberal society.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Well I have to say I didn't like this movie the first time I watched it. I chalked it up to the mood I was in and gave it another try. I was glad I did because I guess it was like Pulp Fiction to me. I didn't get it the first go around.<br /><br />I love the actors and like always they shined in this. You have Jeff Bridges The Dude who is just passing through life. He has two close friends Walter who is John Goodman he relates everything to the war. And then there is Donny played by Steve Buscemi who is a sweet and not allowed to comment friend.<br /><br />This follows the Dudes week I would say. It is a guess to what happened to the rich mans young wife Bunny?<br /><br />I will say my favorite scene was the ransom drop. I have watched this movie to many times and I still laugh out loud. If you want to escape and just relax this is the movie to do it. They have some scenes that you make you think you would be as they used to say tripping. The music is not all that common and the Eagles Hotel California in Spanish is a extra bonus.<br /><br />Either way it is worth checking out and not a waste of your time. I just wish I had gotten to see it in the theater.

1594481938|5.0|In this novel, Nick Hornby, gives a new meaning to the term, \\"suicide pact.\\" The pact upon which the characters in this novel revolve is a pact not to commit suicide.  This informal, sometimes tenous agreement is reached after the central characters -- Maureen, J.J., Jess and Martin -- independently decided one New Year's Eve to jump from the club Toppers, a not uncommon location from which the suicide-bound take their leap, and then thought better of it.  From that point, they are bound by their decision not to die (at least by their own hands).  What follows is a novel that explores each of the four.  In the hands of other writers, A Long Way Down might well have become mired as each of the four recounts a depressing narrative.  Not so, Mr. Hornby; he manages to portray and analyze each of these characters at once sympathetically and with good humor.  This novel's highly introspective characters keep you thinking and smiling throughout, a not insignificant accomplishment.  The result is a great read.
B0000648WZ|4.0|This film is a GREAT movie taken on the surface.  It's when you try to read \\"PC political commentary\\" into it is where it fails.  Robert Heinlein was a great conservative and wrote from a consertive viewpoint.  Verhoven is obviously very liberal, and tries to comment on \\"fascists\\". It don't work.  Incidently; Fascism, if you know anything about it, is MUCH closer to Socialism or Stalinism than anything else.
B00002ND77|4.0|This seems a well-crafted movie by Spike Lee. At the beginning of the movie, before Malcolm becomes politically aware, we see Malcolm and his friends, seemingly happy, emulating the larger societies dress and mannerisms. Is this a statement about the times? Personally, I noticed a parallel between these fawning citizens of yesteryear, and contemporary, going along, happy whites of today -er of 1992.    Was this Lees point?    Malcolm himself becomes politically aware, and thinks back about his relationships with whites. Realizing, at best, he's simply been used by them. He decides to join the Black Muslims. The movie follows him on his rise to prominence, \\"That's too much power for one man to have\\".    I remember when this movie came out. Everyone was wearing Malcolm X T-shirts and Malcolm X hats. I'd never seen anything like it before. Malcolm X's influence and legacy loom larger than ever. Certainly large in 1992.    What is Malcolm X's legacy tho?    Was he just a tool used to pacify the underclass - when they wouldn't trust the media, the government, academia, their women, or whites?    Is his legacy the opposite? One of keeping resistance alive. Certainly people of all kinds seem angrier now than ever. Do the powers-that-be simply think we work harder when we're angry? Or is resistance needed now more than ever?    Is Malcolm X's religious vision actually the most true worship of God, and is this his legacy?    Did Malcolm X create his own legacy. . . ?    In the movie, Lee focuses intensely on the scene where Malcolm and his friend (shorty?), and their girlfriends, play a game of Russian Roulette that Malcolm forces on them. Malcolm is a bad-character at this time, but he becomes aware of the effect this gun and his attitude have on his surrounding friends. . .    Is this his legacy. . . ?    The problem is. . .     People don't condone violence forever. . . What happens when people turn their backs on violence? Unimpressed. What happens when everyone turns their back on violence?     When you no longer have faith in your great 'accomplishments'? Then what are you left with?    Where do you go then?

B00003CXXP|5.0|A.I. Artificial Intelligence was originally a project - a long time project - of director Stanley Kubrick (Dr Strangelove, Eyes Wide Shut). Kubrick died before the project had progressed too far. I knew this movie was dedicated to Kubrick but the movie was just so very good I spent little time trying to discover any hidden meaning. I was thinking, 'this is the best movie I've ever seen'. Spielberg and crew do a wonderful job here.    Haley Joel Osmet plays 'David' an 11 year old boy who is actually an advanced robot. David is an experimental design equipped to learn and feel. David is adopted into the family of Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards). They have an older son Martin (Jake Thomas) who isn't always kind to his new brother.    The message isn't very subtle. . . Over and over and over, and over, David cries, \\"Please make me a real boy\\".    In the end David is hugged by his mother Monica and lies down with her, the narrator saying, \\"for one day. . . there was no Martin. . . no Henry. . . no doctor Hobby. . .\\" Only David and his Mom.

B00005QAPH|1.0|It's really quite amusing reading all of the fawning encomia to this pretentious piece of garbage. Because this film's reputation is based on a top-down critical diktat rather than on inherent quality, most of these reviews either cite some sort of authority (Roger Ebert, the Academy Awards, some frou frou list of the greatest \\"films\\" of \\"cinema\\") to justify their adulation, or they seem to be quoting accolades and analysis from some film-history textbook. The sheep can't bleat their loyalty to received judgement fast enough. After two viewings, I have found nothing of value in 8 1/2. This movie consists of glamourous Italians going here and there talking about_nothing_, with occasional surrealistic hallucinations interspersed. This entire movie is a cheap trick, and that will be acknowledged in a more honest era. In the meantime, it is our duty, like the little child, to proclaim very loudly that the Emperor is naked! I give this movie negative 8 1/2 stars.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is the surprise indie hit that charmed critics and probably took DREAMGIRLS place in the Best Picture nominations this year.  Is this movie Oscar worthy?  That's hard to say..it certainly is entertaining and original, with a screenplay that examines a dysfunctional family in a kindly light.<br /><br />The story focuses around little Olive, a ten year old who wants to enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.  Coached by her wily grandfather, Olive wants to win so badly.  Her father is a motivational speaker whose 9 step program to winning is his ticket for the future, even though no one is really interested in buying it.  Mama is a typical supportive mother whose family means everything to her.  Her brother has recently attempted suicide due to the loss of his male lover and his job.  She feels responsible for getting him back into life.  Her son is a strange one indeed.  He has been in self-imposed silence for nine months to prepare him for a career as an airplane pilot.  Hubby's dad is a grizzly, foul mouthed, heroin addicted octogenarian whose abrasive exterior shadows his true sensitivity.<br /><br />The movie follows their journey to the pageant with some unexpected obstacles.  The cast is uniformly excellent:  Greg Kinnear is superb as the driven dad; Toni Collette is fine as the mom; Alan Arkin in his nominated supporting role provides a nice foundation; Paul Dano is good as the strange son whose future is dashed when a small technicality arises; Steve Carell is wonderful as the suicidal brother; and cute little Abigail Breslin is charming in her supporting actress-nominated role.  (While it's questionable that either she or Arkin are strong contenders for Oscars?).<br /><br />LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a good little film and has a lot to offer.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It usually takes me awhile to warm up to a new TV program. The characters need to gel; the writers need to understand the very people they've created. Heck, even the actors need a few episodes under their belts to understand who they are. Go back and watch Star Trek: Next Gen for a glaring example of this painful metamorphisis. <br /> <br />But Firefly was so, so different. From the beginning, you knew everyone's character, maybe somewhat roughly defined, but nonetheless, you understood them --- and so did the writers. Sure, every once and a while there was a twist in their actions, but even then, you picked up a deeper sense of who these characters were. <br /> <br />14 episodes and a movie; that's it, and Wheldon doesn't seem interested in beating this dead horse any further. A real shame. This was great Sci-Fi entertainment. <br /> <br />Enjoy this collection.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I do not propose to make an detailed, track-by-track review of the work; that has already been thoroughly done by others. Rather, I will simply give my reasons for liking Loreena's latest work. <br /> <br />I bought 6 of Loreena's albums, largely simultaneously, and having listened to them all, I see no tired repetition or lack of creativity.  This CD's contents are definitely new and constitute good listening.  Every artist by nature introduces something of a common thread in all of his/her works, and Loreena McKennitt is no exception.  However, if one simply listens for what is there, rather that what he/she wants to be there, he/she will notice not only the common thread, but the subtle and not-so-subtle differences that make this CD truly unique. <br /> <br />Here is how I arrive at that conclusion: <br /> <br />The way I see it, listening to music really is not about me.  It is not about me listening to what I know makes me feel good or puts me in some other particular mood.  It is much different.  One one level, it is about seeing what the artist has to offer, and perhaps sampling an echo of the creative process.  On a far less cerebral level, it is like looking at roses that are beautiful for the sake of being beautiful (enjoying the music for its own sake). <br /> <br />Buy the CD, you won't regret it. <br />

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have watched several other versions of \\"Jane Eyre\\" and enjoyed each one. This version however, in my opinion, accomplished what none other has as successfully as this one. I was completely emersed in each and every character from start to conclusion of this movie. Ruth Wilson's portrayal of \\"Jane\\" was flawless, she amazed me with the depth and complexity of her character. I felt the heaviness of her rejection,struggles and abuse as a child. I stood amazed by her growth into a woman of grace and honor, with no trace of self pity. Ruth Wilson's performance was surely a gift to me. I found the chemistry between Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens to be powerful. There was not one false emotion on the part of the characters nor moment in which the story line did not flow. This version is a project of beauty which feeds the mind, soul and spirit. If the marker of an extradinary film is it's power to move and affect it's audience, then this version is certainly five-star!
B000CFLFX4|2.0|I bought this sweeper about a year and half ago. Really like it for quick cleanups. Worked great on hardwood and low pile carpet.  The sweeper started to lock up toward the end.  It would run over the floor for about a minute and half and just stop.  So, I figured I'd just order a new one and save the old one for backup parts.  I got the new one and charged it following the guidelines of the booklet.  Well, guess what, the new one didn't run any longer than the old one after a year and half.  It's really too bad, because I really liked the old one for the time it worked.  The company could really have a great product, if they'd work out the bugs with the battery.
1563523302|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read!  It tells the difference between high income and true wealth and how to accomplish it.  The research made the book for me with lots of stats but it is an easy read and the stats are not what the book is about but it enhanced its value for me. If you want to know what it takes to become wealthy, read this book!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Loreena McKennitt has given us another excellent offering. At first listen, I wasn't so sure because I was remembering her past recordings and this one is different from those. Now it is one of my favorites and I don't agree with \\"the powers that be\\" who say it's not a good recording. Loreena's music and singing have matured and the album is a delight, full of cultural and spiritual imagery.
B000K7UBTI|3.0|This movie is great to watch because I've never seen a good representation of Iron Man on film, but overall, the story was so-so. I think that more depth could be achieved, but what to you want for an animated feature like this? I don't know. It was okay, and I enjoyed seeing the character. For a better time, my suggestion is to check out \\"Avengers\\" and the sequel, also on video.
B0002W18MU|4.0|Johnny Cash was always the gritty alternative to pop music.  Taking us on the last road of his journey, it is fitting he gets willing and able support by supple, guitar players.  (Besides himself, six are listed who soften his voice's edge with expert blues, country, and (mostly) acoustical folk guitar licks.)  Much of the material recalls the classic delivery of  his `American Recordings' album, but nearly all of it lays the tracks to heaven (for himself and the listener).  Beautiful, stark, yet uncompromising to his core values, all the songs are marvelous.  Besides a variety of styles, a wealth of songwriters comes to the fore.  Including two indispensable songs by Cash, himself, he borrows from Hank Williams, Bruce Springsteen, (poet) Rod McKuen, and Gordon Lightfoot to broaden the scope of his own already formidable legacy.<br /><br />Not a bad one in the last harvest, Cash's own \\"Like the 309\\" finds him unbaring himself on his last trek.  The heartfelt, \\"Help Me,\\" and the testimonial gospel of his own \\"I Came to Believe\\" are climatic moments.  However, his reflections about his loss of June, including Hank Williams' \\"On the Evening Train\\" and McKuen's \\"Love's Been Good to Me,\\" demonstrate pensive gratitude in the midst of grief.<br /><br />Johnny Cash leaves us as he started.  He's a legend, but the \\"man in black\\" gives us an aged, gravelly voice that matches the rugged road he traveled in life.  Here he uses the first person like he seldom did.  He always had an affinity to the outlaw, the outcast, and the downtrodden, but here he especially strikes a chord for presenting an autobiographical first person more generously than anywhere else to my knowledge.  \\"I'm Free from the Chain Gang Now\\" ends the album better than any way imaginable.  And that's a good way to go.
0743246616|5.0|I've found that the reviews for this (and other) magnolia books seem to be very polarized.  Professional cooks with years of experience getting terrible results and novice bakers getting fabulous results?  If you're trying to decide like I was try making the cupcakes before buying the book.  The vanilla cupcake recipe can be found on martha stewart's website, just search for magnolia.  For me it turned out great, not quite as good as the bakery itself, but as close as I can expect from my junky oven.  If you make them and like them, buy the book.  If you make them and think they're terrible maybe the book is not for you...
B000002L99|4.0|I am not a hagar fan but I do like him with Van Halen.  This album was of course huge & was #1 in US/UK.  Hagar's powerful voice & vocal range & halen's musical abilities were a great match.  David lee roth's voice obviously could not have handled these vocal arrangements, though the band wouldn't have gone in this direction had he stayed. Anyway, 1986, alex van halen went to electric drums & crash ride cymbals & got rid of his roto toms (which I loved), michael anthony's bass lines are muted per usual, eddie van halen is in usual form & his keyboard patterns really dominate this album which I think elevate this album.  Eddie is a great rhythm keyboard player & there is also some great sequencer patterns like in why can't this be love.  Hagar also does some good solo guitar work in love comes walking in.  Alot of good stuff here including why cant..., dreams..., love comes..., & others.  not more to say about it... classic rock album now...  buy it...
0060776757|5.0|written, by the band about the band, the book is fantastic, you can start at the front or dive into a chapter about your favourite U2 album and read how it came about. <br />the book has fantastic photos to go with the text.  Any fan or for that matter music lover should give the book a read or at least page through it. <br />its how autobiographies should be written <br />a wonderful wonderful book
0375758992|5.0|This is a wondeful and amazing book!  I received it from Amazon on Thursday afternoon, started it on Friday and was finished with it by Sat. noon.  Within the first few pages, I felt like I was back in Africa. Her descriptions and depictions of the African way of life, the slang  used (Bembe, Shona, SA., etc.), and the brutal honesty of life as it was in Africa as a \\"white African\\" is incredibly true to life.  I grew up on the Copperbelt in Zambia (I'm on American nationality but moved there for my formative years) and this brought back loads of memories.  I went to Arundel school as well, although I was a few years before the author and did not know her, and I can tell you that everything in this book of memoirs, cannot be more true.  The African way of life, unless you've lived it, and the continent itself, unless you've been there, cannot be known but she has been able to encapture its essence.  I urge all  to read it!   I read her 2nd book, Scribbling the Cat, yesterday as well...Once again, a vibrant story!  Kudos, Alexandra!
B000M2E2QY|5.0|From what I heard from this CD, I can say it is really fun and easy to dance to.  The style of music reminds me of the new CD by the Scissor Sisters which has a disco feel to it.  My favorite song so far is \\"Relax Take it Easy\\".  I would recommend this CD highly.  I haven't heard all of the songs because it isn't out till Feb 8th, yet I love what I have heard.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|I suspect that most Christians already owned a copy of Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" In my case, I owned the widescreen edition.<br /><br />If you don't own a copy -- Stop reading right now, and buy this DVD!<br /><br />If you do own a copy, you're probably wondering what's new in this re-release.<br /><br />Mel Gibson's 2004 blockbuster is at the same time part documentary and part (very personal) artistic meditation of the Passion -- the suffering and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is perhaps one of the most moving films ever made and one of the most important films for evangelism in today's secularist Culture of Death.<br /><br />Three years after its release (which, like the Gospels themselves, was a source of heated debate and division), it has been re-released as a \\"Definitive Edition,\\" with a number of special features:<br /><br />The movie is still in Aramaic and Latin, with subtitles. The purpose of this is to avoid \\"bringing Jesus into today's world\\" and rather force the viewer back in time, as if you were a witness to the actual events. Disc 1 has both the theatrical and re-cut version of the film, complete with accompanying commentaries by filmmakers, cinematographers, producers, musical directors and theologians. A particularly wonderful feature is an enhanced viewing mode featuring Biblical footnotes while the movie is playing. Disc 2 features one reasonably in-depth behind-the-scenes/making-of documentary. The other features on this disc include mini featurettes on religious art, ancient languages, a short showcase of the actual places in Jerusalem where the Stations of the Cross occurred, production art, a couple of deleted scenes, and a few other things like actors' bios and (disappointingly short) lives of the saints.<br /><br />Personally, I found the discussion regarding ancient languages most interesting. Fr.Fulco, who served as historical and ancient language consultant during the scripting, shooting and post-production of the film, is erudite and well spoken. The section on religious art was quite engaging, but a bit disappointing in its superficiality (perhaps because I have a particular interest in art history and love the details). It would have been nice, for example, if the names of artists and some details of the pieces accompanied the art documentary and the art gallery. However, in exchange, the DVD gives a great mini documentary on crucifixion as a mode of punishment and execution.<br /><br />As far as the behind-the-scenes features, most touching were Jim Caviezel's humble and soft-spoken interview, during which he (and others) describes the physical, mental and spiritual anguish he was made to endure during the making of this movie -- which include, but are not limited to, eight-hour makeup sessions, itching, migraine headaches, freezing weather (while in a loin cloth), being whipped for real, having the several-hundred-pound cross fall on him and crush his skull, and being struck by lightning.<br /><br />Over these past three years, I have often wondered (with great frustration) why they didn't include extras on the DVD release of \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" Perhaps the reason was that they did not want people to view this as a regular movie, concentrating on how it was made, etc. Rather, they wanted people to take the movie as it was and concentrate on the message and the emotional/spiritual impact that it had on them, as viewers. Whether Catholic/Christian, Jewish, agnostic or atheist, it is sure to have profound impact on the very fiber of every human being.<br /><br />This re-release comes at a good time -- just when the movie is starting to fade from people's minds. The strong impact that it had three years ago is starting to taper out, and people are settling back into their fast-paced modern lives, which too often results in a distilling of religious convictions and a laxity of spiritual fervor.<br /><br />Well, Lent is around the corner (February 21, 2007), and this movie makes a wonderful accompaniment to spiritual preparation during this time.<br /><br />For those who have never seen the movie, now is the time.<br /><br />For those who have seen it, but don't particularly care to see it again -- The extras may give you a new appreciation for the film and spark a sudden desire to watch it over again. This may move you to meditate on its scenes, pray and feel closer to God.<br /><br />And that is a very good thing.1, 2007), and this movie makes a wonderful accompaniment to spiritual preparation during this time. <br /> <br />For those who have never seen the movie, now is the time. <br /> <br />For those who have seen it, but don't particularly care to see it again -- The extras may give you a new appreciation for the film and spark a sudden desire to watch it over again.

1400064287|5.0|I'm not a fan of business books.  I think most of them are poorly written article-length essays that have been deliberately bloated to book length.  But now and then I am delighted to find exceptions.  This is one of them. <br /> <br />Most businesses depend on communicating ideas in a way that clients will attend to, remember, and act on appropriately.  This book teaches how we can make our ideas effective.  After setting the stage for what follows, it focuses on six key principles that are clearly explained and undoubtedly useful.  Moreover, every bit of the book -- from the detailed table of contents to the separate chapters to the summary in the epilogue to the quick reference guide at the end -- exemplifies the principles being advocated. <br /> <br />I think I'm a pretty good presenter, but this book make me aware of numerous ways I could improve what I say and how I say it to better capture a client or prospect's interest and trigger a positive response.  In particular, the book made me think about numerous possible ways that I could better communicate analytic results to audiences that are typically either non-analytic or mixed.  Tough job!  Several examples in the book tackle the problem straight on. <br /> <br />I highly recommend to anyone that deals directly with clients or prospects, and particularly to individuals with analytic jobs who have to explain their results to clients or colleagues.  Read this  book, apply its principles to your work, and you will be pleasantly surprised.
B00027JYLC|4.0|Freaks is surprisingly still intriguing and unique 75 years after it's original release. The story is interesting and the acting fairly believable. The short running time (66 minutes) is actually not much of a hindrance either, as it simply allows the film to get down to business quickly.<br /><br />All the characters are amazing to see on screen as most of them are real circus performers: The Human Torso, the \\"pinheads\\", two women with no arms, a bearded woman, the human skeleton, and the list goes on.  Even in this day and age, seeing these people on scren is mesmerizing.<br /><br />The DVD includes a great amount of special features, including an hour long feauturette where several historians and circus performers discuss the impact of the movie, and the give background on several characters in the film. With the special features and the film itself combined, this DVD is unmissable. Definitely worth checking out.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised as I expected this movie to be much worse. The only problems I had were that the plot could have been a little more involved, and why was EVERYONE in this film in near perfect physical condition. It was like \\"ABFEST 2007\\". <br /> <br />Other than these two points, it was a nice idea, well filmed, and interesting. The special effects were very good, nothing new, but good.  I liked the \\"bubble blast\\" they used. I thought it was a nice visual representation of shock waves or chi or whatever the power is supposed to be that they harness.   <br /> <br />It screams sequel at the end, but I expect the most we would get is a straight to DVD thing that would be much worse rather than fix the few flaws it had.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Two Irish kids from the Southside of Boston join the MA State Police in an elite department to deal with organized crime. One - Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon - has been groomed by mob kingpin Frank Costello to infiltrate this department and act as his mole. The other - Bill Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio - comes from a less than stellar family and is hired to infiltrate Frank's mob leanings and become a mole for the State Police. Eventually both the police and Frank realize they have a rat working for the other side, and it comes down to a game of cat and mouse to find and catch the culprit. <br /> <br />Martin Scorsese will love this film. It has all the elements that endear fans to him: raw, gritty action and violence. He makes no excuses for that. Fans will think the film is perfect and quite possibly the best they've seen all year. For those of us who do not proclaim to be fans of Mr. Scorsese's work, the film is less than perfection and very far from his best. The acting is great - DiCaprio has certainly come into his own, with this film and with \\"Blood Diamond.\\" Matt Damon does an OK job as well. Mark Wahlberg turns in a performance that is both brutal and memorable. And even though some might say that Jack Nicholson was \\"overacting,\\" I thought he was deliciously evil in his role. <br /> <br />So, what problems did I have? Surprisingly, nothing to do with the amount of violence. Hey, when one sees a gangster film one can expect violence, and this one delivers. For me, the movie had a lot of confusion in the beginning. Establishing storyline and who was who left me feeling more like I simply didn't know what was going on. Of course, I've found this to be a trait of Scorsese's films, so to be expected, I guess. He seems to like a lot of entanglements. It also doesn't help that, surprisingly, DiCaprio and Damon look amazingly alike. Who would have thought that? However, after about the half way point (or maybe a little more) the plot finally began to even out for me and things began to make sense. Characters settled in and I could pick up on what was going on. But, as I said, this usually happens to me in a Scorsese film. <br /> <br />The last point was language. It is heavy in this film. I know, I know. \\"That's that way people talk\\" is an excuse I just don't buy. It's not the way I talk, and it's not the way people I know talk. And when I converse with people casually, they don't talk that way, so no, it's not the way people talk. I hold the The Godfather up as an example: powerful movie, what I consider the premier gangster movie, and very little (any???) cursing. It can be done. Anyway, if you happen to be like me, this might bother you. Then again, maybe not. <br /> <br />Overall a very good film and I would recommend it. I actually liked this better than \\"Gangs of New York\\" and \\"Aviator.\\" The film isn't perfect (for the person who isn't a total fan of Scorsese), but it does have much going for it.  <br /> <br />
0060888695|5.0|For a couple of glorious weeks, I looked forward to the thirty-five minute drive to and from work as I listened to or rather relived this powerful story, a book I first read in high school. Traffic jams were welcomed. <br /> <br />Miss Spacek gives a gentle but powerful rendition, bringing the characters   from a small Alabama town in the 1930' to life. I'm always amazed and curious how one person can capture the myriad of people of both sexes, young and old and of different races and accents. I could envision the town and its inhabitants while listening to Miss Spacek's masterful understated performance.  <br /> <br />For those few not familiar with the basic plot, I refer you to the excellent review by David Evans on December 28, 2006.
B00000ILDF|4.0|The redheaded stepchild, or in this case the shaved headed stepchild, Alien 3 you either love it or you hate it, you really cant be on the fence. Die hard alien enthusiast impaled themselves on Giger-esque protrusions the second this movie came out. I remember, before I had even seen the film hearing the critics take a big \\"queen\\" sized egg laying crap on it. I saw it, and although it isn't my favorite out of the three (number 2 is) I still loved it. I have to admit I was disappointed that Newt, Bishop and Hicks didn't make it seeing as how the entire plot of Aliens revolved around rescuing Newt in the end, how many people died trying to rescue her? Anyway, the complaints I have seen usually say that they shouldn't have killed Ripley, even though Sigourney Weaver helped produce this film and it was her idea to do it, I think it was entirely appropriate to kill her off and I will tell you why. The poor woman, if you think about it, from the first alien, to aliens to alien 3 has maybe spent a handful of days awake, its been years and years and years but to her its as if for two weeks she has seen nothing but friends and loved ones die, and fought these bugs with her whole being. Knowing, a queen was inside her, was the last straw. Impregnated by the one adversary who has ripped your life away from you must have been both horrifying and in a way a relief from all the pain. In the end she embraces her death, as well as her death bringer thinking she is ending the chain of tragedy. Just like when she brings Bishop back and he says that he would rather her just disconnect him than exist as a half being (or in his case a quarter) she would rather choose her fate than have the Alien choose it for her. The cast in this movie is amazing; I am especially enamored with Charles Dance who played Dr. Clemons. The first movie I ever saw him in was The Golden Child and he played \\"Sardo Numspa\\" Charles Dutton, Pete Postlethwaite, and many unknowns at the time make a kind of \\"Alcatraz monastery\\" in space, and they all give the bleakness and desperation and fear a face. No matter what you think, you cannot argue that there are good performances, the setting was awesome and that any Alien is a good Alien. My only complaint is the, of course, CGI effects in dealing with the Alien in action, it just hasn't aged well at all and they should update that.monastery\\" in space, and they all give the bleakness and desperation and fear a face.

B0000WN0ZK|2.0|This English film was very successful commercially for American audiences given its story about a fashion photographer. We see a truck load of mimes running around, then a young photographer shooting a fashion model. [The pictures will be used in advertising to suggest to customers they will look like a model if they buy and use the product; the belief in magic.] The photographer's drive shows some of the new public housing, three stories high. After visiting an antique store he starts taking snapshots in a nearby park. [These areas are all strangely vacant of people.] He notices a young woman and older man in the park, by a grassy knoll, and follows to shoot them. The young woman does not want to be photographed. The photographer is interested in acquiring real estate that will quickly appreciate. <br /> <br />When he arrives home that young woman arrives to ask for the photographs. She persists, but fail. But the photographer gives her another roll, and makes a deal. Later he develops the roll of film and inspects it, then makes a blow-up of the frames. He notices a detail in the background. Two young girls show up uninvited, and this leads to the frolic that made this film popular. Afterwards he notices a detail in one of the prints and makes an enlargement. The picture becomes clearer. He returns to the park and finds the man. [Is this possible in any public park?] When he returns home he finds all his prints have vanished, and the negatives too! <br /> <br />On the way back he stops at a club, listens to the music, and takes a souvenir. [More senseless action.] Next he visits a party; one room is for smoking. He asks his friend to return to the park. When the photographer returns the next morning the park has been cleared, nothing remains. The truck of mimes returns to act out a game of tennis. The photographer goes to pick up an imaginary ball and throws it into the court. It seems real now. Or just imagined? <br /> <br />Could such an aimless story become a big hit? The story about an assassination that is covered up has obvious references to the 1960s. A later film \\"Blow Out\\" echoes this story but has a more coherent story. <br />
630542828X|4.0|Interesting movie to say the least with great cast of actors, very well acted movie and great storyline! John Travolta plays cocky personal injury lawyer, Jan Schlichtmann, who decides to take on an environmental case where several children have died from leukemia due to water contamination from poisons/pollutants used by a tannery factory in the New England area. The tannery factory is owned by two big companies and Travolta's character along with his three other colleagues decide to take on the case to help assist the families and of course for the big pay out from these companies.    Unfortunately, Travolta's character and the rest of his colleagues become hugely in debt trying to win this case and have over extended themselves. The large corporations that own the tannery factory offer a $10 Million dollar settlement, which Travolta's and colleagues reluctantly accept because they know they don't have the money to take this case to court & are so far in debt that their personal finances are at stake.    Travolta's character eventually finds more evidence in this case and forwards all the depositions, environmental reports, evidence etc. to the Environmental Protection Agency in hopes they will take on this case in an appeals court. The Environmental Protection Agency does take on this case and wins! So not all is lost. This is a real feel good story with a happy ending.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is our favorite Christmas movie.  We wanted to get it on DVD for the clearer picture quality and we're very satisfied.  It's a wonderfully encouraging story.  We bought it for some friends of ours who are going through difficult times and questioning why.  It was an encouragement to them.
0679731377|4.0|This is an odd little book, composed of, I surmise, 11 distinct stories that have a very tenuous connection to each other. They are all well written and hold the interest of the reader. We go from the Deluge to the present day in various tales, and one inner dialogue. There's really no overarching plot, except most of the stories mention woodworms, which appears to be the link that binds most of this work together. It's an interesting book to read, and can stretch your mind a bit, which is actually a good thing.
B000088E6D|5.0|I got this album as a Christmas gift.  I figured \\"male crooner flavor of the month puts out good background music album.\\"  After all, pretty standard covers.  Well, Mr. Buble totally surprised me and caught me off guard.  He actually manages to make these standards and covers fresh in some subtle, artistic ways.  If a song ain't broke you don't need to fix it, and this is his approach, which I like.  But he still brings a unique artistry to the works.  My absolute favorite is \\"Fever.\\"  I mean at first I thought, \\"how hackeneyed, the original was perfect, end of story.\\"  Buble brings a very sexy male perspective to the song and knows what it's about.  He makes it his own, and he does it by just singing it unabashedly for what it is.  That's just one example, he does it with the rest of the material too.  Half the genius is his selection of covers.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|I'm a little bewildered by all the reviews stating how \\"awful\\", \\"boring\\", <br />\\"depressing\\" and \\"disapppointing\\" this CD is.  I'm a fan of Norah, not a <br />fanatic, but I really enjoy her music.  I liked her first CD, and I've <br />enjoyed the subsequent ones as well.  This one is what I expected--good, <br />melodic songs performed well without a trace of overkill.  And contrary <br />to many opinions here, I do see artistic growth.  Each of her albums (and <br />I include the Little Willies CD too) has a little bit of a different vibe <br />than the one before.  Sometimes I think that people dislike Norah more <br />for what she ISN'T than for what she is.  For my money, she is one of the <br />best and most musical performers out there.  If you're a fan, I'd advise <br />you to listen to the sound clips (on Amazon or elsewhere) and decide for <br />yourself.  Personally, I like it a lot!

B000K7VHQE|5.0|This is not a great film, but is definitely worth the time for some enjoyable eccentric behavior from a brilliant cast. Ms. Breslin's and Mr. Arkin's Oscar noms speak for themselves, but Kinnear, Carrell, Paul Dano and, especially, Toni Collette are so in touch with their material that Ms. Breslin's only task is to be reactionary, which she does beautifully and naturally. I HATE bad kid-actors and she won me over. There's fire and wisdom behind those beautiful, spectacled eyes, and when she lets loose at the end, you simply HAVE to cheer. I'm glad it won the Ensemble Cast award at SAG, though I doubt it will win Best Picture at the Oscars, if only because the directors weren't nominated. The clever screenplay of Michael Arndt may be its only chance of a win. Dysfunctional families have inundated our films lately, but I can't think of one recently that had me believing that such families could be as entertaining. Indeed, the plot is outrageous, pitting one obstacle against another, but the ending is satisfying and appropriate. \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is a small, easy to watch film, and though some previous reviewers were offended by the foul language, I thought it was representational of the characters' state at the moment. Yes, people do talk like that a lot. Lighten up, folks... I had a good time, and laughed a lot. I also felt for the characters, something I can't always say. Due to its popularity, it almost screams for a sequel. I hope they leave it alone, and let it stand by itself. Further interventions into the lives of these characters might be overkill.  UPDATE: I love Eddie Murphy, but I'm glad Arkin won the Oscar. His foul-mouthed outrage is remembered more than the sweet moments he had with Ms. Breslin.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Alien quadrilogy (I don't think much of Alien vs. Predator, though), so was very happy when I found that the Madison, Wisconsin public library had this set. It's nice that both original theatrical release and director's cut versions are included. <br /> <br />The features are excellent too, I was amused to find that HR Giger is actually a rather cherubic-looking character who says he hates worms and other slimy things. The best parts for laughs are the interviews and mis-takes of the infamous chestburster scene, and the horribly corny taglines on the rejected movie poster ideas:  <br /> <br />\\"It is an unspeakable horror. <br />Unlike anything previously experienced by mankind. <br />And what seven human beings are suffering now far out in the universe will soon, all too soon, be shared by us all.\\"
0156027321|5.0|Piscine Patel, (nicknamed Pi), lives in India with his Indian parents and brother. His father is a zookeeper there, and they are a struggling family just trying to make ends meet. Pi himself is a very bookish type of kid, while his brother Ravi is more of the typical boy type. Pi is into religion where his family is not at all, really, and he develops a strong faith and belief in God-which is a good thing as he'll need it along the way for survival.  <br /> <br />What happens in the story is that his father is ordered to sell the zoo there on the property where it has been located-and the family will have to travel the Pacific Ocean way over to Canada to start anew in their business. So they sell most of their animals along with it with the exception of Orange Juice, an orangatuan, Richard Parker, the bengal tiger, the hyena, and the zebra. They are securely on a ship with all their baggage and the 4 wild animals until tragedy strikes and the ship sinks. <br /> <br />The only survivors left were the four animals and of course Pi himself who is devastated at the tragedy. The ship is all gone, but there is a lifeboat on board. This becomes Pi's lifeline and home for the next many many days until he can devise a more secure enclosure for himself. And that is not his only trouble. There are still the wild animals left, and once they get loose there is trouble. The hyena kills the zebra and the orangatuan, the animals left are the tiger and the hyena-but when the tiger gets close to the hyena, he mauls him too death too, and it is just Richard Parker, and Pi against the world.  <br /> <br />Pi is very terrified. But in spite of this. he finds food yet inside the tarpaulin with many days worth to eat. He also has a device on how to make fresh water from salt water, as he becomes desparately thirsty and hopelessly tired. He finally is able to create a shelter for himself away from the elements of nature so he can stay dry as much as possible. But with the bengal tiger on board, he has to watch his back. So then he always has to find ways to work around Richard Parker without getting killed. <br /> <br />There are many times when he hopes for a ship to come and rescue him, and almost succombs to death. But his will is strong for survival, and with many prayers to God, there is a rescue made, after a close call to death once again. As it turns out, Richard Parker ends up saving his life before disappearing into a jungle after reaching an island at long last.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is a breathe of fresh air.  Sure it has violence and blood but it also has some of the funniest lines ever.  I love the opening credits when it shows us how in some way we are all zombie like.  Shaun (PICKLE) and his roomate Ed are unaware that slowly but surely people are starting to turn into zombies.  Now Shaun and Ed must go rescue his girlfriend and her roomates.  They all end up traveling together for safe haven along with Shaun's mom.  The writers added the right amount of comedy along with zombie movie etiquette to make one of the finest zombie movies to come along in quite a while.   <br /> <br />I love the record throwing part...
B0002Y69NG|5.0|The Matrix cycle is built upon a masterful foundation: a brilliantly tangled hierarchy of mythoi, both ancient and postmodern, and even esoteric, weaved into a rich tapestry on which the persuasions and production values of the films are embroidered. From the cycle's literal Logos to its plot's epic Pathos, the Wachowski Brothers' Ethos guides the loom.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This box is fully loaded.  Two versions of each movie.  I enjoy the director's cut versions more than the theatrical versions.  The first two movies are the best in my opinion. <br /> <br />ALIEN- a complete sci-fi masterpiece.  The story, the actors, and the setting are superb.  The special effects were awesome for the time of 1979.  The chest thing messed me up back then!!  I love it. <br /> <br />ALIENS- Ripley returns to aide in what she believes is a rescue mission but is mislead.  Jones stays home though.  More action packed as James Cameron takes the helm at this one.  Excellent sequel. <br /> <br />ALIEN 3- Kinda wierd how she lands on a planet used solely for a mens prison.  The dog/alien mixture is pretty cool.  Is she with Child? <br /> <br />ALIEN Resurrection- A new form of Ripley?  This fourth installment was quite enjoyable considering part three was stank.  Why does she play basketball good?  Alien blood?   <br /> <br />my review was kinda lacking on the info but believe me this box set is worth the price.
B0000024UF|5.0|The stark arrangements work well with these songs from Cohen.  On many songs, Cohen is only accompanied by his guitar, a jew's harp and a bass.  But it works.  These songs are varied and interesting.  A CD worth buying for Cohen fans.
0440419514|1.0|\\"His Dark Materials\\" refers to the a line in the novel Paradise Lost about the Devil's use of the elements. (Correction: I thought the line was talking about the Devil as at that point, as it referred to a \\"fiend\\" standing at the edge of Hell, but it looks like it's referring to God as the \\"field\\", which is even worse.) These texts should be added to the list of the Devil's subtle tools. These books are anti-God and anti-church.<br /><br />They say \\"God\\" is not God, just a created angel who came into being by elementary particles. The characters in the book work towards the goal of killing this \\"God\\" and succeeding where the previous rebellion (the fall of the Devil) failed. The main characters finally decide that there is no God.<br /><br />At no point is the Devil or his evil discussed. \\"Demons\\" are not fallen angels who serve the Devil, but instead this word is used to refer to the noble soul-animal that each human has. (Note: The book refers to daemons as the soul-animals, but never refers to the Devil's angels as demons. In the movie they will be saying \\"DEEmon\\" - a dangerous thing - you don't want your kids hoping to find demons.)<br /><br />The church is portrayed as a wholly evil oppressive force. Catholics are mocked. Priests are assassins. A former nun tells the children the story of how she decided there was no God and this story awakens the children to \\"wisdom\\", self-awareness, and the beginning of their love affair (as 12 year olds).<br /><br />There is no heaven nor hell. There is a hades-type place of suffering. The \\"heaven\\" a soul should strive for is to have itself disintegrate and become one with the nature.<br /><br />This book is not for children. Adults likewise should avoid it.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is without doubt one of the finest Christmas flicks ever made.  Cary Grant just does Cary Grant sooooo Well.  I highly recommend this movie once you have watched Grinch and Elve too many times...this will help you get back into the true holiday spirit.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Nothing will cause me to push the 'no' button faster than reading a review which compares a film to a novel.  It is an unfair comparison.  Anybody who expects a film to be 'faithful' to the novel is simply delusional.      With that rant aside, let me say that i have read the book, I have seen the Beckinsale version and I still consider this  my favorite of the two.  The reason is a matter of humor.  While the Beckinsale version is very 'faithful', this has a wonderful genteel humor which I think Austen herself would appreciate.
B000E2AZ2C|4.0|i have seen the original theatrical version and the 'director's cut' in 1992. it's my opinion that this version with the voice over narration to be the better version of the two. though most people might not 'get it', it begs for a second viewing and is truly a gret film, if not a masterpiece.  <br />this wa a ground breaking film, it is smacks of the old 'film noir' movies of the 1940s-but with a futuristic feel to it. ask any artist, graphic artist, designer or film maker and they will most likely tell you that this film was the reason why they chose their careers...great set design and conceptual art.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Normally, I would be the first guy to scream in disgust when artists remix their older albums. ZZ Top would be the best example of the horror that can happen when you remix your back catalog. However, in this case (and Raw Power by Iggy & the Stooges), the remix of Rust In Peace sounds better than it ever did.<br /><br />In comparison to the original cd (which wasn't produced bad to begin with) it is mindblowing. This is the best possible example of how relevant good music can be with the right production. From the intro riffs of Holy Wars, it's clear that this remix is worth its weight in gold. I hadn't really listened to this cd on a regular basis since middle school when it came out and I have to say, it hasn't left my cd player all week. There have been many differing opinions on Dave's remixes but Rust in Peace is a home run. All a classic album like that needs is a fresh remaster/remix and it makes all the modern metal acts blush.<br /><br />Remastering old albums is par for the course and hard to mess up.<br /><br />Remixing is playing with fire but Dave succeeds 100% on this cd.<br /><br />In short, if you don't have the remix, you're missing out. It's like going from an 8-track tape to a CD. Enjoy.
0517548232|3.0|This book is easy and interesting to read...and a good introduction to economic thinking from a libertarian perspective, following Hayek's footsteps. It should not be taken for a basic economics or introduction to economics manual.   <br /> <br />The chapters are short and very comprehensible, with a conspicuous lack of technical lingo, complicated graphs or strange data.  They are especially advisable to those that want to understand conceptually, in a clear language, some of the inner workings of national microeconomics. One important remark is that the book focuses mainly on microeconomics, (explaining, for example, some effects of prices, consumers/producers behavior, etc) rather than on the big macroeconomics (balance of payments, growth, etc) or international economics issues (trade, FDI, etc).  <br /> <br />I like the point regarding one of the main troubles of modern-day economists: the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences...I think this not only is true but also applicable to other arenas, like politics.  On the other hand, I think the author is too one-sided in his libertarian approach. He is plainly against government involvement and consistently overstates the role of rational markets and the evil of intervention.  <br />
B000AP04OM|5.0|This is our \\"rainy day\\" movie and I don't think my kids and I could tire of it if there were 10 rainy days in a row.  We make popcorn with M&M's, get under the comforters on the sofa and settle in. <br /> <br />We recently went to the Trapp Family Lodge in Vermont where we went cross country skiing and took a horse drawn sleigh ride.  My kids will never forget it. <br /> <br />There is so much junk available to divert kids.....in the movies, television, video games, etc.  It's great to have a family tradition that we all love and that involves such a great film.
1591840562|5.0|The business of America has always had moral imperative. As noted in my former history teacher Scott Sandage's \\"Born Losers\\", the word failure as conflated by personal and economic conditions is uniquely American. Popular notions of what business is for changes with the times. Fifty years ago, in the age of mass media and industrial boom, business principles in public consciousness can be summarized by Peter Drucker's \\"management by objectives\\": stern dictums issued from above. What then, are today's tipping point and the long tail about? <br /> <br />The latest development of the self-referential economy: business as entertainment. Now we demand our CEOs shed their anonymous pinstripes to don black turtlenecks. Sleek geeks. In an era where a theater-quality movie can reasonably be produced for less than the cost of a house, we are broaching an era where the entrepreneur and the creative class are the dominant cultural force. The motivations are to make customer's lives easier, rather than creating artificial demands as mass media tried. Netflix merely takes our desire for a hundred year old medium and makes it easier to select and get. Amazon works with an even older business. <br /> <br />Leading the way in the new era are mavens like Guy Kawasaki, who spells out his evangelism in \\"The Art of the Start\\". Forget the business plan, what's your mantra? Kawasaki brings us his insight from his twenty years as an entrepreneur to distill the essence of the art. We discover the entrepreneur is not some mythical hero, but rather an ordinary citizen equipped with one basic notion: get started on something that means something. One has the urge to almost throw down the book in shame of wasting time reading and run to our desks to get started. His energy is infectious, his examples crisp and memorable, and he does not belabor himself. Be clear, be brief, be seated. <br /> <br />Communication is at the heart of his mission. This means maintaining a clear idea of what the pursuit is for. If it can't be expressed in a handful of words, can it. If the competitors won't say the opposite (we're slow and customer-unfriendly) then you're not standing for anything meaningful. Once you've developed your own mantra, spread the good word. The decision makers are not always the customer per se, sometimes it's implicitly their parents or spouse. If they can't explain what it is, it's dead in the water. But ultimately, the customer is who you are appealing to, not your ego. The customer doesn't care that you want to \\"kill the competition\\" or \\"be the leader in ____\\", what can you do for them? Write a business plan to shore up the ideas you were already working on. Build a sales forecast from the bottom up (there's a global market of $5 billion, but right now I can reach $1 million). Use your competitors against themselves: copy their business model, partner up, brand against them. <br /> <br />Kawasaki succeeds in getting us to realize entrepreneurship is about going from the status quo to the hoi polloi's needs. But this book is far too enjoyable to be business literature. Truman was close, the entertainment of America is business.
B0002X314C|2.0|Like so many, R&B artist of today, Legend, fails only in his selection of material to perform. He is a talented singer. However, an absence of beautiful and memorable melodies and lyrics that shake the emotional core of the listener wastes his talent.     In \\"Heaven\\" for example,  his melody lacks depth and the majority of the song becomes a repeat of a worn out hook... \\"Heaven only knows... yeah, yeah... oooh oooh.\\" While the body of the lyrics contain less than gems like: \\"We can lose control, baby don't you know\\".     Compare this to Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On?\\"  \\"Mother, mother  There's too many of you crying  Brother, brother, brother  There's far too many of you dying\\"    Many artists, opt for writing their own material for the financial incentive, for example Mariah Carey, in writing her own material she has sacrificed an overall beauty in the art in favor of spotlighting her vocal skill. I hope that Legend's management is providing him with the quality song writers he needs to promote him to great heights.     Yahoo is previewing Legend's performance videos and is comparing him to Marvin Gaye. This is premature and in a significant way diminishes Gaye's musical legacy. Legend definitely possesses the physical skills to reach great heights, but he has not yet demonstrated the type of musical savvy that places him in this elite catagory    In an interview he says that he likes music that is timeless. In order to achieve this Legend may need to employ professional writers.
B000301YY8|5.0|I was hanging around a discount CD hole-in-the-wall store, while my teen daughter was shopping, and I heard this great song playing over the sound system. I think it was 'Tears and Rain'.  I was instantly hooked; went to the counter and asked to buy what was playing.  I bought Back to Bedlam.  I love this CD. I don't know exactly why. I'm not overwhelmed by the lyrics, Blunt's voice is not incredible, whatever, but I listen to this with pleasure over and over again. I love 'High' and 'Tears and Rain'.  But I enjoy all of them. I don't care about knowing what every lyric is. I really enjoy listening to this and that is enough. 'Bravery' is really good, too.  I'm looking forward to his next CD. I love the line 'f***ing high'--prefer the unadulterated version.  Update a couple of years later:  James Blunt was a one-CD wonder.  Didn't like his 2nd CD AT ALL.  And if I heard 'You're Beautiful' over the radio one more time, I would have lost my mind.....
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Outstanding visuals and performance. One of the best concert dvd's out there. A must have.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|This DVD is just great. Nothing else is needed to be told though I will go on a bit further.     What made this DVD so enjoyable for me was the performances of Cesare Siepi and Otto Edelmann. They act in a way that you know they enjoy themselves immensely and therefore you enjoy it immensely. I consider this a jewel in my Opera collection. It is \\"the\\" Don Giovanni to buy if you are going to buy the opera for the first time.    Edit: Now that I have recieved the 15th Complete Mozart Edition box that contains Don Giovanni, I can compare the two performances. One is a DVD Video and the other is an Audio CD so I can only compare the musical performance. There is no hesitation when I say that this DVD is just better than the ACDs. As the title implies Siepi is the real jewel of this performance. I stand by what I have told earlier, if you are going to see/hear Don Giovanni for the first time, there should be no hesitation as to which performance you are going to get.     And here's another little thing that I have forgotten to mention befor the edit. The only flaw you can find in this DVD is that sometimes the camera focuses on wrong places. Like, when Siepi is shown close-up the background is in focus not his face. This disturbed me a little but it can't degrade the quality of this DVD in my eyes. But I thought future buyers need to know this.
B00008DDXC|3.0|I'm very glad that this movie was faithful to the source material, which is not always the case.  Very little was cut, and even though the movie was close to running to long at 2 1/2 hours, it told the whole story. <br /> <br />My favorite part of the movie had to by Kenneth Brannaugh (spelling?) as Lockhart, over-the-top but perfect in this case, played his role perfectly. Very amusing and fun.  I must say that I do like Richard Harris as Dumbeldore, and his pressence is missed in later movies.  He fits the gentle, wise nature perfectly as the headmaster.  Just about everything from the book was depicted in the movie as I expected. From Arragog, to the flying car, the basilisk, etc. Exciting, fun and vibrant. <br /> <br />The only thing that didn't come across as I would have liked are Dobby and Moaning Myrtle. Understandably they are written to be annoying characters, and that said they are hard to watch in a movie.  I don't care for the voice of Myrtle, but it does fit the description. A minor complaint for a great movie. <br /> <br />Although I think the house-elves are important to later stories in the books, I am mostly glad of their abscence in the movies. I feel that if something should be cut, their involvement, or Hermione's interest in house-elves is a good place to start. <br /> <br />A fun movie with good visual effects, and everything I expected to see. A good popcorn movie. The first movie and second movie seem just about as good, if not better than their counter-part novels.  I'm looking forward to number 5 this summer!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I attended the original \\"Dark side of the Moon\\" tour in the 70's and also attended this same concert in Columbus, Ohio ('94 or '95?) anyway, this DVD is awesome. I've always raved about the best concerts I've attended have both been Floyd concerts...I finally have the proof! It's a 2 disc set and whether intentionally or accidently, the whole 2nd disc is pretty much a retake of \\"Dark side.\\" It does include the encores, but they are also classic songs by Floyd...I love this DVD and encourage anyone who is a Pink Floyd fan to grab this. It is surely one for the ages if just for the 2nd disc. I'm glad they took their time and engineered this to play on 5-1 surround sound...I finally got to confirm that the birds I was hearing at the '95 concert weren't birds in the stadium! :-)) I always told people that it sounded like birds were flying around the stadium during \\"Division Bell!\\" I got a lot of raised eyebrows and patronizing smiles. Buy this one, you'll love it.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|CASINO ROYALE is the best James Bond film since ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE was the last film that was truly based on Ian Fleming's novel. Now comes CASINO ROYALE. This is an outstanding adaptation of Ian Fleming's book. Daniel Craig returns Bond to the no nonsense character that we last saw in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. CASINO ROYALE along with ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and DR. NO are the best Bond films of the series.

1423328612|3.0|I just finished the unabridged CD audiobook.  I thought the story was very good (4-5 stars). The dramatization was very poor (1 star).  Thus I gave it an average of 3 stars. <br /> <br />The accents are very poorly done. <br /> <br />Also, each CD is divided into too many tracks (~80-90).  My CD player doesn't handle the track transitions well so I end up missing several words at the end of each track change.

I own a KDF-46E2000 sony rear projection LCD with 720 of resolution and the movie looks awesome. Cristal clear image with no visible grain or blemish including the dark scenes of the movie ( and this movie has a lot). Highly recommended. I'm not a big fan of extras but the extras are good, but are in the resolution of traditional dvd. Don't expect the extras to look like the movie. If you have any doubt about buying this movie go ahead with confidence, you will not be dissapointed.

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins does a magnificent job of explaining away the justifications for the existence of God in a comprehensive assessment of the modern belief system enshrined by the three major theistic religions.  More importantly, Dawkins lays out a case for challenging the long-held tenent that religious belief is due special reverence in polite conversation and argues that children should be protected from indoctrination at all costs.  If his book were to reside on the bookshelves of all American households and children raised in homes where these ideas were discussed, our country would be better off.

0307346609|5.0|I ripped through this book in the span of two days worth of lunch hours and coffeehouses and finished it grateful for what it wasn't:  long. <br /> <br />I was somewhere near the middle of the book, reading it voraciously, when it dawned on me that in anyone else's hands, this would have been some behemoth of a seven volume globe spanning epic that sketched out every character we read about and several who would have died in the process of the story.  Every ounce of drama would be extracted from every scene, each decision would be drawn out in excruciating detail and then, just when we got to the end, it would be announced that there would be a brief, three volume coda coming the following year. <br /> <br />We don't get that here.  We get the epic and the drama, we get the awful repercussions (personal as well as global) of the decisions that had to be made and see, certainly not everything, but a broad enough sampling of events to get a general sense of what was going on in the world as the plague spreads and is eventually beaten back.  It is a succinct, economical novel that shows just enough to let us fill in what the author doesn't tell us about. <br /> <br />This is a great, ripping read and I'm already looking forward to going back to it once my reading pile is under a bit more control.
B0000C1733|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers hit their commercial stride after switching record labels (from Capitol to Warners) in 1991. They had been struggling with capitol's general indifference (I remember hearing the Peppers on K-Roq in Los Angeles blasting their former label as \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" was about to be released) and a lack of commercial success, when their fortunes changed with \\"Under The Bridge.\\"<br /><br />Suddenly the Red Hot Chili Peppers were everywhere. They have had an amazing run with the WB, and that is what this CD represents. (Exception: \\"Higher Ground,\\" the Stevie Wonder cover from the album \\"Mother's Milk.\\") It is also where the really hit their stride as artists. Rick Rubin lassoed their energy for BSSM, and those funk/rock hybrids like \\"Give It Away\\" and \\"Suck My Kiss\\" promptly reshaped the musical landscape. Flea became the bassist everyone wanted to sound like and Antony Kiedis became a sex symbol. This mammoth success was tempered by loss (\\"Under The Bridge\\" is an eulogy for heroin casualty Hillel Slovak and then super-guitarist John Frusciante went on hiatus) and the less than well received \\"One Hot Minute\\" reflected that. Navarro's psychedelic style didn't gel the way Frusciante's aggressive funk did, and the album reflected that. Only \\"My Friends\\" appears from the Dave Navarro era. (\\"Warped\\" and \\"Aeroplane\\" would have been nice here, though.)<br /><br />But John rejoined for \\"Californication,\\" which remains my favorite RHCP album. It must be pretty high on the band's list as well, since five songs from that CD made it to this best of. \\"Otherside\\" and \\"Scar Tissue\\" rate with the band's most melodic songs. \\"By The Way\\" continued in that vein, with energized rock workouts like \\"Universally Speaking\\" matching mid-tempo goodies like the title track.<br /><br />Of the new songs, \\"Fortune Faded\\" is the best of the two. You also get the soundtrack cut \\"Soul To Squeeze,\\" saving it from \\"Coneheads\\" soundtrack obscurity. (But why no \\"Love Rollercoaster?\\")<br /><br />There are several key tracks missing, like \\"Love Rollercoaster\\" and anything else from \\"One Hot Minute.\\" \\"The Zephyr Song\\" from \\"By The Way\\" could have made an appearance. If you really want to dig deeper, the \\"What Hits\\" collection covers the band's wilder years prior to BSSM. I can also say that most of the albums from this period are everybit as good as their individual songs would suggest, and you could easily get those instead of \\"Greatest Hits.\\"oaster?\\")  <br /> <br />There are several key tracks missing, like \\"Love Rollercoaster\\" and anything else from \\"One Hot Minute.\\" \\"The Zephyr Song\\" from \\"By The Way\\" could have made an appearance.

B000IONJJ2|5.0|The movie is in great shape, and the extras are worth the money.  The cast interviews were quite revealing.  Jamie Lee tells who she thinks the best kisser was among Kline, Palin, and Cleese. And you find out if Cleese really was hung out a window or if it was just special effects.  Cleese's running commentary was worth sitting through, even for me, and I usually hate those things.  The deleted scenes weren't very interesting--just shots, really, not even full scenes.  Overall, though, I'm very glad I bought it!
B000J103YI|5.0|My family and I love this collection form the movie. We also listen to the music from the original play with the original artists. We sing it in the car and in the house. Even my 2-yr. old daugheter knows most of the words and sings along. Just yesterday I was giving my son's teammate a ride home and he said that he and his whole family loved it too and we ALL sang it in the car. He said that he saw the movie five times (I saw it twice and the original play once in Chicago.) He said his father loved it, but tried to hide it. He encouraged my son to go see it who thought it might be too \\"girly\\". It is infectious, fun, upbeat, and has something for everyone. I recommend it highly.

B000067J1I|5.0|A lot of people don't like Tom Hanks. For me, he's a quality actor and not only for winning academy awards (that doesn't prove anything), but because he does act hard in every movie he makes.     \\"Big\\" tells the story of josh, a 13 yrs old boy who makes a wish in one of those machines where you throw in a coin, at a town fair. His wish? to grow up, so no bully could put his hands over him. The following day, he wakes up to realize he's not a boy anymore. Later on, he has to deal wih a grown-up daily fears: job, getting an apartment, falling love, being heart broken, dealing with bad people, etc... everything that makes life, life.     Is a \\"must see\\" 80's classic. Simple, classic, entertaining.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is by far the best adaptation of the book and has not been afraid to focus the story totally on the two lovers. I'm sure traditionalists will be unhappy with that but I'm as pleased as punch.<br /><br />Its given Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson the opportunity of a lifetime to bring to life a Rochester and Jane we really care about. I'm at the end of my seat waiting for tomorrow's final instrument and I'm not alone.<br /><br />Its definitely a case of move over Colin Firth and hello Toby Stephens. He's made me fall in love with the character of Rochester and I have to admit I've rather fallen for the delectable Toby too. I particularly like the humor he's brought to the role and vulnerability. He certainly looks good in a pair of breeches and boots. His on screen chemistry with Ruth has been a delight to watch. I wish I could watch them together for many more weeks.<br /><br />The series and 2 leads deserve a BAFTA and international Emmy.
B000K7UBTI|2.0|As a Marvel connoisseur, I tried to enjoy this film, but too many liberties were taken with the origin story for the sake of \\"updating\\" it and too many random changes were made (such as reducing the Mandarin's 10 rings to 5 and changing the appearance and size of the original gray armor).  I agree with the reviewer who found similar flaws in the Fantastic Four film; it is sad that Marvel allows so many random, gratuitous changes to be made to its characters and their histories.
0395951054|5.0|Great book!!!!!! <br /> <br />Lots of great information about how the media works.......also the real story of Nazism and Pan-Germanism <br /> <br />
B00005JMCW|5.0|I watched this movie with my 13 year old son.  We'd been bickering one afternoon, and he went to his room to get away from me.  This movie came on the TV.  I watched the first 5 minutes and thought it was so perfectly humorous, I called my son in to watch it.  We both loved it.  The themes between a teenage girl & her mom can apply in some respects to what a teenage son and his mom experience.  My son & I both have to see good acting for a movie to truly appeal to us, this has it.  Lindsay Lohan's partying ways in her personal life overshadow her acting abilities, but with the right roles, she's great, and she flawlessly pulls this role off.  Jamie Lee offers the perfect portrayal of a teenager in an adult body.  Two pivotal characters who appear for only a brief time are the mother & daughter who run the Chinese restaurant.  They couldn't be better at these small but important parts in this story.  One of my favorite movies.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Very good Chrstmas album, with enough class to make you forget it is a Christmas album much ot the time.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|To me good movies can be measured by the silence not by the words, this picture has few words, and very well chosen. It is the silence of how we grow up, with all our mistakes and experience, distilled in the wise moment of watching the stars.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Little by little one discover with pleasure and (often) fun the interesting and various personalities of the characters through the season, which story is definitely a thriller at times. <br /> <br />Acting is gripping and it is hard not to identify with one of the characters during the season where most of the situations could occur in real life. <br />Susan and her tender sensitiveness, Bree and her apparent coldness, smart  Lynette and the sexy Gabrielle offer different lives perspectives, which all in all make a great show. <br /> <br /> <br />Tip : almost each disk has an \\"Extended episode\\" (in Bonuses) ; you may want to watch directly the extended version instead of the truncated one... but beware the extended episode is first introduced by a guy who seem delighted to reveal spoilers! You may want to skip the (1-2 mn) introduction...

1400062756|4.0|The book gave me an interesting and unique way of looking at learning and especially my own weaknesses and strengths.
076531178X|5.0|What I really liked about this novel is that there are three interesting \\"magic systems\\" that play a role in this novel. Two aren't really explained in depth (assumably they'll be explained more in the next two books), but the main one in this novel was very interesting. It followed the rules of physics, which made it seem more realistic and interesting. I also liked the idea of the mists and the role they played in the book. I found the character of Vin to be very good and I liked her character arc throughout the book. There is a lot of humor in this book that I really enjoyed, and there is some romance (which as a girl I always love).  <br /> <br />Basically, I recommend this novel to anyone that likes fantasy, especially fantasy that pulls away from the typical swords and dragons. I can't wait till the next book, The Well of Ascension, comes out!

B000H30B3G|5.0|I have been waiting for this King Kong Collectors Edition from the same day the Movie Started showing in Cinemas, and I nearly gave up...But here it is, Its packing if Fantastic with a classic old look of the Empire state building with Air Force Planes flying by, The Dvd box with 3 Disk Edition is Fantastic a very nice front cover with a shiney cover box...Then the Statue, Perfectly Detailed to give you an exact image of the World's 8th Wonder climbing the Empire State Building... <br />The dvd is packed with special features and Extra movie minuites which is why it makes it the special edition.. <br />Every thing in this Boxset is Perfect buy in my opinion just one small tiny flaw...I do not like the way Ann looks in King Kong's hand, in my opinion it the only flaw but its not big enough to loose a star...So if you haven't got it yet buy it before they get sold out!
B000002J1S|5.0|It's very simple -- this is an all-time great album. It has been a real pleasure to revisit this album over the past few weeks, as I listened to it a ton in high school and then kind of went away from it. It was, without question, the artistic high point for Genesis.<br /><br />Musically, everyone is in fine form. Keyboardist Tony Banks' playing is inventive and I actually prefer his piano work, especially on The Lamia. As for drummer Phil Collins, we'll get to him in a bit, but forget for a moment that he wrote cornball songs like Another Day In Paradise and You'll Be In My Heart. On this album, his drumming is tremendous, and you can see why people like Eno, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant held him in such high regard.<br /><br />It's true that guitarist Steve Hackett is left a bit out of the mix here, but it doesn't detract at all from the album's overall brilliance.  He gets his moments throughout the album.<br /><br />It's true that \\"Lamb\\" is considered prog, but there are actually several fine pop songs on here:  The title track, Counting Out Time, Carpet Crawlers, The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging, and It.  Furthermore, songs like The Lamia and In The Cage are simply staggering achievements, and overall this album is a triumph of production.  But it's extremely accessible, and remains so nearly 33 years after the fact.<br /><br />Listening to this album for so long has allowed me to clarify my Phil Collins argument. I think everyone can agree that many people believed the band was completely finished after Gabriel decided to pursue a solo career. I had a neighbor who openly snickered at the band's decision to continue with Collins on lead vocal and chief songwriter. (Many readers of this page would likely join in this snickering.)  \\"How dare they,\\" he sneered.<br /><br />It seemed like the band, especially Collins, became a bit of an underdog after Gabriel's exit, and I guess I always like to root for the underdog.<br /><br />The band didn't try to copy Gabriel's style, and that was a smart decision. Rather, they evolved into a more commercial sound, which ultimately led to their descent into total cheese.<br /><br />But with every successful post-Gabriel Genesis album, I found myself thinking, \\"They can do it!  They don't NEED Gabriel! Good for them!\\" I regarded them as a feel-good story, and I just kept rooting for them to show the world they could make it without their resident genius to do everything for them.<br /><br />However, the party was over by Invisible Touch.<br /><br />Finally, Gabriel's solo output had many commercial similarities to post-'75 Genesis. In fact, it could be argued that Gabriel fired the first \\"sell-out\\" shot with Solsbury Hill, which is pure commercial pop (some would say pap). Time has caught up to that song, it seems.  Other songs with strong commercial sensibilities are Biko, Shock The Monkey, I Don't Remember....and all of So.<br /><br />I do acknowledge that So is 1,000 times the album Invisible Touch is, and Gabriel holds a clear edge in the comparison of solo Gabriel to Collins-era Genesis. But Gabriel's solo material wasn't nearly as adventurous as some claim, and Collins' Genesis wasn't total tripe.<br /><br />This will cost me votes, but I actually argue that Abacab and \\"Genesis\\" are both excellent.  You just can't compare them to Lamb or Selling England By The Pound.  It's a different sound altogether.  After Gabriel left Genesis, the band should have changed its name to Exodus or Revelations or Ruth.y to copy Gabriel's style, and that was a smart decision.

A great first thumbprint book!

0060833459|5.0|One of my favorite authors is Peter F. Drucker. I recently re-read his book, \\"The Effective Executive â\\" The Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done\\" (this plays perfectly into my theme of time leadership. Leadership is the working on the right things versus Management which is doing things right.) Effectiveness is more important than efficiency.<br /><br />According to Peter Drucker, effective executives follow the same eight practices:<br /><br />They asked, \\"What needs to be done?\\"<br /><br />They asked, \\"What is right for the enterpise?\\"<br /><br />They developed action plans.<br /><br />They took responsibility for decisions.<br /><br />They took responsibility for communicating.<br /><br />They were focused on opportunities rather than problems<br /><br />They ran productive meetings.<br /><br />They thought and said \\"we\\" rather than âaeIâ.<br /><br />I particularly liked his view on taking responsibility for decisions.<br /><br />\\"A decision has not been made until people know:<br /><br />The name of the person accountble for carrying it out;<br /><br />The deadline; the names of the people who will be affected by the decision and therefore have to know about, understand, and approve it â\\" or at least not be strongly opposed to it; The names of the people who have to be informed of the decision, even if they are not directly affected by it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.\\"<br /><br />I could continue regurgitating and typing most of the book; however, I think it is such an excellent book that you should read it yourself.<br /><br />Because I have been swamped lately, I resonated with one of his comments which was executives' time tend to belong to everybody else. Of course I blog about time management so part of time management is to figure out how to get control of time even though according to Drucker, the time actually belongs to everyone else.cker, the time actually belongs to everyone else. <br /> <br />

0618680004|5.0|A devastating defense of atheism, very convincing and rigorous, proving that the best defense is a good offence.<br /><br />  It's a great book and well worth buying, but be prepared to have slow going in the more arcane philosophical areas.<br /><br />  Dawkins is ruthless in it's arguments and humor. It is no wonder that Dawkins is reviled by the Christian Right. His book lays bare the non-existent underpinnings of the world's religions.<br /><br />  This book is needed as American marches toward a Christian Taliban regime.

B000H0MKGK|3.0|While it's true that Continuum represents a musical evolution for John Mayer, I feel the album sorely lacks the spirit of Room For Squares and to a lesser extent, Heavier Things.  If you read my review of Mayer's debut album, you'll find I'm quick to sing its praises - and I even included it on my \\"Desert Island Album Collection\\" list.  However, with each new record, it appears that Mayer begins wallowing further in self-pity and uncertainty on the future (although \\"Stop This Train\\" is one of the few bright spots.)  Additionally, his choice to bring politics into the equation on Continuum left a bad taste in my mouth (I can't help but wonder if Sting's choice to do the same on Zenyatta Mondatta - consequently the Police's third album - played a factor).  I understand some will say \\"You can never go home again\\" and I never expected Mayer to release Room For Squares volumes 2 and 3.  However, I also don't believe it's too much to ask for something besides mopey lovelorn ballads, anti-war sentiment, and Hendrix cover tunes.  I recommend that Room For Squares fans skip over this record and instead spend their money on Death Cab For Cutie's \\"Plans\\".

0743289412|1.0|Hi,  <br />I bought this book in hardback for something to read over christmas. <br /> <br />From page 1 I found the book very disappointing and not at all upto the great mans (S.king) abilities or past performance. <br /> <br />TO sum up it the storey froma womans point fo view, has very few characters and has a totally guesable ending from the start! <br /> <br />THere were no twists and turns of any great surprise and I think like a lot of readers I couldn't wait for it to end!. <br /> <br />BUt the really annoying thing about the book was that nearly every scene was gond over and over and over again at different points in the book with a lot of phrases being repeated over and over, slowing the whole pace down and boring the pants of me! <br /> <br />One big bo bo in the book is obvious, about half way through, that I think it shows total lack of repsect for the reader that the publishers would let it go out with it in it. <br /> <br />I am not saying everything in a book must be prefect, but if you have a plot and you want the reader to be entertained you have to give them some intelligence. <br /> <br />All I will say is that a message is left on an answering machine for the 'protagnosit' and when the police officer calls, who is looking for the protagonist he doesnt get it!  Strange! <br /> <br />We that wont stop me form beign a big fan of S Kings becasue he 'ususally' has an easy stlye of writing. <br /> <br />TTFN
B000MCH5P4|2.0|If this were simply the segment set in Japan, it would have made for a wonderful film. As it stands, the Japanese segment is really just a long tangent, for it really doesnt connect all that well to the rest of the film at all. As for those other parts, its your typical interconnected stories sort of come together to create an overall feel type movie, the type of film Robert Altman made so well, and the type of film that has been way overdone in the past few years. The problem with these films is the writer figures that he can make everything sort of interesting, then cut away when it gets boring. It's lazy screenwriting. The real problem with Babel, though, is every time a scene starts to get interesting, they cut away. It makes for a very mediocre experience. Brad Pitt looks a little rugged and cries somewhat, Cate Blanchett sleeps or moans the whole film, Gael Garcia Bernal shows up and looks crazy and then disappears suddenly, and everyone else acts like an idiot. Not a single person in this film acts like a real human being would act. These characters act in accordance with the screenwriters ideas. Even the directing, which is usually pretty fantastic from this guy (even in the horrible, horrible 21 Grams) is drab, except, again, for the Tokyo scenes. All in all, a film that really could have used some great editing. If you didnt buy into the hype of Crash, then dont check this out. However, if you thought Crash was the apex of modern cinema, you'll most likely drool all over this one too. My suggestion- dont buy into the reviews.

0722532938|1.0|The Alchemist is a great book originally written in Portugese. Looking for a third party bargain as a gift, I wound up with a copy marked \\"For sale only on the Indian sub-continent\\". The translation was meant for a different culture and missed many of the nuances of the western/Amercian/English translation. It was terrible. I couldn't give that as a gift and returned it and bought the full priced edition to be sure that I received the American version.
B00006690G|5.0|This is the greatest album ever made. Though in his other albums, eminem displays his amazing range and the genius of his lyrics, in the eminem show his sound really matures. and by the way you'll notice that anyone who gave this a negative review dont even listen to rap. just shut up. you dont see me leaving idiotic comments on your heavy metal artists (most of which couldnt write good lyrics to save thier life) any real fan of rap at least recognize his extraordinary talent
0765310015|4.0|It is difficult to read fantasy literature and say that it is truly original these days.  Sometime it seems that everything you read seems like a poor recapitulation of some other landmark work.  No so for the Malazan series.  The characters and powers that are unveiled throughout the series are essentially unlike those of standard fantasy.  The story follows more of a mythology approach than sword-and-sorcery.  The plot is almost infinitely complex.  There is a rich pantheon of gods all personally involved in human affairs and pushing their own agendas.<br /><br />This series is not very accessible and the reading is difficult through at least the first third of the book - maybe unnecessarily so - but the payoff is immense.  People who revel in the simple, linear plots of Salvatore or the one-dimensional characters of Goodkind may not like this series.  It actually takes effort to get through.  The only criticism I have is that I found the climaxes of the first two books in the series to be somewhat forced and perhaps rushed, based on previously unsubstantiated material.  Almost as if Erikson was running out of pages and had to get to the end quickly.  This gives the books somewhat of a lack of internal validity.  None the less it is extremely intriguing fantasy reading and I recommend it highly.
B0000646UN|5.0|This is how war movies are supposed to be made.  You feel tired by the end of this one because you almost feel like you were in those trenches with them.  Outstanding movie making about a conflict which is often overlooked.  Hollywood should take a lot of notes from this movie.  Definitely belongs in the collection of any military history enthusiast.

B000009PNY|3.0|You would typically not buy this album if you were going to buy one single album to learn more about either Depeche Mode or any of the participating bands.

This is a Must have DVD for anyone who likes Clapton or good guitar music preformed by some of the greatest legends in music.<br /><br />I just enjoyed listening, but most of all watching other musicians appreciating the talents of the people preforming with them.

B00005JMEW|3.0|This movie came out while I was living in Japan, so I happened to see it in a theater over there.  I was very impressed with the story and the overall quality of the movie.  Definitely one of Quentin Tarantino's better works.<br /><br />Then, a year later, I was visiting America and saw the American release.  I couldn't believe how much they butchered it!  They edited it so much to avoid the NC-17 rating that it ruined the overall quality.  The fight scene against the Crazy 88's was spectacular, but they changed it to black and white and cut out the messiest parts.  Other particularly gruesome parts were edited too.  Even the amputation of Sophie's arm was cut. (No pun intended :P )<br /><br />I love the Kill Bill movies, but I will never purchase the hacked-up American release.  The unedited Japanese version, done exactly the way Quentin intended it to be, is all I care to see.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is the best documentary  I have ever seen.  It is about a problem that should foremost on the mind of every person on this planet.  It is only fitting that Al Gore has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and the film nominated for an Academy Award.

I bought this book and it has slowly made its way through my inner circle of friends. This book also helped me to stop taking crap that guys put out. If you like me, you'll FIND time to call me... I don't care how busy you are! I've noticed that since I've stopped accepting excuses (as I did before reading this book), the guys I HAVE dated have been much more respectful, and you better believe they know to call me when they say they're going to! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to ANY women (especially college age) in the dating scene. Start dating guys who ARE into you.

B000H305U0|4.0|I loved Timberland before this album and did not really care for  Timberlake. However on this album their collaboration was an act of genius and the tracks on the album and Timberlake's voice were Fabulous. I usually prefer meaningful lyrics and although I loved \\"Sexy Back\\" and \\"What goes around\\", the lyrics certainly lacked a certain depth. On the other hand, there is much to be said for going with the flow and being honest with what you are feeling, I guess Timberlake wan't feeling particularly deep and so I will look for my depth elsewhere and listen to this album when I want to have mindless and shallow fun.
B000M06K5C|5.0|I was worried that they would not be able to top Silent Alarm, but after one listen, they have proven they have what it takes to continue making great music.

0553583182|5.0|The process of attraction, and the many universal laws are not so easy to undertake.  It takes a lot of education, and of course, an easy to follow guideline for putting the wheels in motion.  I have read many, many books on these principles.  However, many of them are difficult to put into practice, because the process isn't a very clear one.  Especially when we have grown up in a highly negative environment.  This book, however, is written in lay language.  It is easy to read, comprehend, and put into practice.  Joseph Murphy believes in the power of prayers and affirmations, to 'plant seeds' in the soil of your subconscious mind, to bring things into reality.  Prayers and affirmations are included in this book, and many of them are very valuable and useful.<br /><br />This process IS tricky to put into play and you may not see results right away, but be patient.  If you properly apply the information in this book, you WILL get whatever you want in life.  You might have to read the book 5 times before you finally begin to master the techniques.  It will pay off enormously in the end though, and it's well worth having the book glued to your hands for the next few months.<br /><br />The only downside I can see in this book is the constant God references.  It didn't bother me, but I know some people are turned off by a book that mentions God on nearly every page.  For me, it worked, but I can understand why it wouldn't for others.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was happy last year because I found Pride & Prejudice. <br />I watched the DVD over 20 times and still counting... <br />The first disk became damaged so I had to buy another one and now it's failing... <br />I'm listening to the music CD almost every day... <br />I read the book for the first time and am reading it once again... <br />(No, I'm not a native English speaker.) <br />I read all the customer reviews of US and UK Amazon.com. <br />I bought and watched the 10th Anniversary BBC series. <br />I even got the 1940 version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. <br /> <br />Yet, the first impression was the strongest and it's never fading away. <br />We all are biased to our first impression.  <br />It's Austen power, but director Wright, composer Marianelli, and stars Keira Knightley and Mattew MacFadyen did a wonderful job, too. <br />They made my life-time favorite movie. <br /> <br />

074356619X|5.0|After reading a few of the reviews, I was reminded that this is not for everyone.  I truly respect the opinion of all those who wrote a review.  It is in my opinion that this so called secret is merely the Bible written in a different way.  It says to love each other, give thanks, believe (faith), do what is right, etc.  All these things are written in the Bible.  Afterall, isn't that how we are supposed to be?  next time you listen to any gospel songs think of the secret.  I find that things sung about, written in the Bible, are also the things talked about in the secret.  Let go of the past, don't hate, do unto others, have faith, know that its done, give thanks, praise evreyone and everything, etc.  Not to say that the Bible or church is not needed but you can't go wrong by really focusing on the secret. <br />Just an observation.  I am not a Bible verse quoting type of person but a spiritual person who is only seeking a better realtionship with God.  That being said, from my limited experiences with the secret, I found that it works for me.  I have seen results.  I feels that God put these ideas and dreams in my head, I have acted on them and I am seeing the benefits. <br />I also realize that sometimes someone has to be ready to receive or in the right frame of mind to understand what is being shown to them.  I was shown the secret DVD by a friend and then I in turn have shared it with family and friends who also have not had any out of pocket expense but also enjoy it as well. <br />Can you do everything the Bible says?  It is difficult but trying is better than not trying.  When you meet your maker, you can ask all the questions you want about why children are hurt or killed.  I can't answer  that.  But what I can say is that even with direction, we still have to do our part and follow it.  whether you do or don't it doesn't matter to anyone but you.  Even if you don't believe in God, the things shared in the secret are still things that we should follow to be good people.   <br />What is so bad about the secret?  Is it bad because some is making money from it?  So what!  Isn't someone making money from everything?  Maybe some wish they had found it first.  That's too bad. <br />I personally try to live by the idea that \\"continuos effort, not strength or intelligence is the key to unlocking our potential.\\"

0140621970|4.0|\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a unique story in the Sherlock Holmes canon -- author Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it in the years between Holmes' death and his resurrection several years later.<br /><br />But due to public pressure, Doyle brought Holmes and Watson back temporarily for a sort of \\"memoir\\" tale, a tale of supernatural curses, escaped convicts and ghastly glowing hounds. It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.<br /><br />Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.<br /><br />But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.<br /><br />The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.<br /><br />Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book.

B00000HYXB|4.0|There are already tons of reviews for this album, but I just felt like I had to add one.  I'm coming at this from a somewhat different perspective, for I'm not a fan of Blind Guardian (this being the only album I own by them), nor am I a fan of this genre of music.  Yet despite my preferences, I still enjoy this disc enough to give a four star rating, which really says something I think. <br /> <br />I bought this album because I'd read so much about how it was inspired by the Silmarillion, one of my favorite books.  At first I was pretty skeptical for a few reasons.  For one, it really sounded like a gimmick to me.  Lots of metal groups (especially European progressive ones) have theme albums, and they can be quite good, but they can also be exceptionally bad.  Specifically Tolkien-themed stuff that's actually good is almost impossible to create, because it's hard to live up to Tolkien's writing abilities, especially considering that in the case of the Silmarillion, Tolkien spent almost his entire life slowly polishing the history of Middle Earth (from 1917 to 1973).  I was also skeptical because I didn't see how a fast-paced, heavy metal album could possibly do justice to the content.  The Silmarillion has some incredible highs, but mostly it is a tragedy: the tragedy of the Noldor, their \\"doom\\" as Tolkien would say.  I thought that if anything fit Middle Earth musically, it would probably have to be some kind of New Age/Celtic/Folk fusion, all on a very somber note (maybe with some Mideastern influences). <br /> <br />I could go on, but I was expecting this album to be way off the track.  Yet I was proven wrong.  The theme album concept worked beautifully because Blind Guardian was smart - they didn't go off on a tangent and make the Silmarillion their own by reinterpreting it.  Nor did they do what I expected, and which I would have loathed: utilizing as many placenames, character names, etc as possible just to \\"suck up\\" to Tolkien fans.  Instead they kept out the gratuitous use of Tolkien's names, and used them but sparingly when necessary.  The Tolkien names that Blind Guardian used amount to but a few: Silmarils, Noldor, Feanor, Arda, Vala, Morgoth, Eldar, Valinor, and possibly a couple others.  That's it.  If you've read the Silmarillion you know it's chocked full of names; the index takes up 80 of the 460 pages in my edition.  I really expected this to be a Tolkien love fest, but instead anyone listening can tell that Blind Guardian was truly INSPIRED by Tolkien to write the things they did, they did not just REHASH or regurgitate what he had already written.  Yet they didn't reinterpret either, for the lyrics are all pretty spot on with the storyline (once you figure out what's being referred to), they just did it without gratuitously spewing Tolkien at us. <br /> <br />As to the music itself: I'm still hesitant to say I like it.  I simply love the choruses: it sounds like a hundred people are singing the words, and it gives the choruses such power.  At first the only thing I liked about the songs were the choruses; they were diamonds in the rough, tiny little gems that I had to wade through lots of power-metal to listen to.  As time has passed and I've listened to the album more and more, I've begun to like some of the fast paced songs in their entirety.  There are a few really great riffs that get stuck in my head, but the choruses remain the most compelling parts of the songs. <br /> <br />\\"Into the Storm\\" and \\"Nightfall\\" were the first two songs that won me over.  The choruses are great, and the rest of the tracks are epic as well.  I'd say these are the most popular songs on the disc, and possibly the most popular Blind Guardian songs overall (based on the fact that I was at a BG show for three songs before I had to leave, and 2 of the first 3 were the aforementioned tracks).  But surprisingly, I've started to really like other songs as well.  The chorus to \\"Mirror Mirror\\" is one of the best choruses, and \\"BloodTears\\" has some great moments as well.  But right now my very favorite song off the album is \\"The Curse of Feanor.\\"  I can't get enough of this song; it just stays in my head for days.  It keeps conjuring the story anew in my mind: Feanor, in his fell wrath, cursing Morgoth and vowing to have his revenge and to regain the Silmarils.  Epic is a word that I can't help but use, and though the word applies to much of the album, it is at its high point right here.  Another song that has this same epic quality to it as far as the theme goes is \\"Dead Winter Reigns.\\"  This track shows us the Noldor at the pinnacle of their folly, as they have just slain their kindred, and have journeyed far to the north to cross the sea when they are confronted by Mandos, who pronounces their full doom.  Fantastic!  The music I'm not wild about, but the lyrics are just pefect: `Noldor, blood is on your hands,' `this deed can't be undone,' `can't escape from my damnation,' and especially the whole last part of the song after the final chorus, which I won't spell out here.  So many great lines.  \\"The Eldar\\" is a great slow song - I was surprised BG could write a song like this after listening to the album up to this point (though the vocals get a little breathy in parts).  I was so happy to see BG make use of the concept of the \\"doom of the Noldor\\" in this track.  This is possibly the best song thematically, because the tragic nature of the entire story of the elves that returned to Middle Earth is melded with a very somber sounding song. <br /> <br />There are still some songs I don't like at all (mostly toward the end of the album, if you haven't figured that out yet): \\"When Sorrow Sang\\" is my least favorite, followed by \\"A Dark Passage.\\"  I'm not wild about \\"Time Stands Still\\" either, though there's a cool acoustic riff in there.  And it's taken a LONG time for the narrated tracks to grow on me.  If you haven't recently read the Silmarillion, these narrations will mean nothing to you, andwill detract from the album as a whole, but in the context of the storyline they're (usually) fairly appropriate. <br /> <br />Well this review is already long enough.  On some days I could almost give this a 5, and on some days only a 3.  But coming from someone who doesn't like this genre of music, I think 4-stars is a huge success.  Blind Guardian has accomplished their goal, and they have given us a soundtrack to the tragic aspects of the Silmarillion.

0786185791|3.0|Can't say that this really grabs me like On The Road did. I feel less like in on the action and comings and goings of the people mentioned in the novel. Admittedly this may have to do with the fact that I actually read On The Road before I purchased the audio book and I only read part of The Dharma Bums, before getting the audio book. The person who narrates the audio book seems bored and listless.
B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago Transit Authority's 1969 or '70 debut album is extremely awesome. Those who own the LP could double their pleasure with this 2 LP set. Great tracks include DOES ANYBODY REALLY KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS? featuring a piano introduction which was deleted for the single version,BEGINNINGS and QUESTIONS 67 & 68. The follow-up was a 2 LP set also and CTA would shorten the band name to \\"Chicago\\". Of course,this is a Chicago-based band with Peter Cetera leading the group,at least most of the time. Eventually,he would leave the band for a solo career which continues today. The band would lose Terry Kath in 1978 to suicide via a firearm. James Pankow would later work with the Bee Gees(in '78).
0060853980|5.0|Good Omens is a great read; the story line follows an angel and a demon as they partner their way to prevent the end of the world (and the resultant end to their interactions amongst humanity). Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett team up to craft a story full of the humor, satire and well developed characters you'd except from any of their solo works. <br />As an added bonus, DEATH makes an appearance, as one of the four horsemen, though Pollution has replaced Pestilence, who found the going tough due to antibiotics.
B000069KE0|5.0|Fans of the band originally known as Chicago Transit Authority have doubled their listening pleasure with their 2 LP debut album. This sophomore effort is a 2 LP set as well featuring 2 Top 10 hits like 25 OR 6 TO 4 and COLOUR MY WORLD. Tracks 7-12 on this CD is a series entitled \\"A Girl In Buchannon\\". CMW is part of this series. Track 12,NOW MORE THAN EVER features a reprise of Track 6,MAKE ME SMILE(toward the end of track 12). I also like MOVIN' IN,THE ROAD,FANCY COLOURS and MEMORIES OF LOVE which is a nice,easy listening piece where you'll hear strings,a harp and a flute. Side 4 of the LP(tracks 19-22 on the CD) features another series entitled \\"It Better End Soon\\". The tracks are entitled,1ST MOVEMENT,2ND MOVEMENT,3RD MOVEMENT and 4TH MOVEMENT. The other songs are great.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|I went for the deluxe version and was not in the least disappointed with the extra footage and behinds-the-scenes stuff. I'm so glad to see Norah writing more of her own songs. Whatever she does is flawless, sultry, gorgeous, inspired...she surrounds herself with such a team of amazing musicians and seems to hold it all together with such poise and grace. \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" has amazing groove. \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" is rhythmic and intense. Norah has both serious and playful, fun stuff going on. Mellow, sexy, and really intriguing. Haven't sunk my teeth into it fully yet, but am very happy with this latest acquisition to my music collection, and hats of Norah and her posse. Love the animation on the video \\"Thinking of You\\"...find Norah such a refreshing and intriguing voice and on the scene...lots of be discovered under each leaf of these new offerings...
B000IU3XTW|5.0|\\"Foo Fighters\\" is one of those bands I've always liked but never really considered myself a huge fan.  When one of their songs came on the radio, I wouldn't change the station, however, they weren't the type of band I would run out and buy each new CD.  Given to me as an unexpected Christmas gift, \\"Skin and Bones\\" has turned me into a full-blooded convert.<br /><br />Like Pearl Jam's superb \\"Live on Two Legs\\" CD, \\"Skin and Bones\\" is essentially a live, acoustic collection of Dave Grohl and Comapany's Greatest Hits (speckled with a few compelling covers).  Stripped down to the basics, their most popular songs are performed in both raw and nuanced ways so that they sound both hauntingly familiar and refreshingly new.<br /><br />Highlights from the CD include:<br /><br />Track 3: An aching \\"Walking after You.\\"<br /><br />Track 4: A gutsy, guitar-driven cover of one my all-time favorite Nirvana songs, \\"Marigold.\\"<br /><br />Track 8: A folksy/bluesy duet version of \\"Big Me.\\"<br /><br />Track 15: The definative version of the Foo Fighter's greatest song, and one of the greatest rock-and-roll songs ever, \\"Everlong.\\"<br /><br />\\"Skin and Bones\\" has been in my car's CD player for well over a month now.  I don't forsee it leaving for any extended period anytime soon.  For someone who grew up on grunge, \\"Skin and Bones\\" plays like the melancholy soundtrack to my life.
0743539133|5.0|I bought the Audio CD Version. <br /> <br />What a great book.  Filled with very interesting insights into one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) presidents we have had.  Gives a compelling inside look into the thoughts and opinions of such a great assemblege of men that were so well suited to be in the cabinet. <br /> <br />While a lot of other reviewers have focussed on the book itself, a note about the Audio CD version.  Of all of the Audio CD's I have purchased, the narrator for this one, Richard Thomas of Walton's fame, is by far the best that I have heard.  He really brings life to the narration.  He does a fabulous job of using the tone and mood of his voice to match the material that he is reading.  I found it really enhanced the book.  Five stars for Richard Thomas to go along with five stars for Doris Kearns Goodwin.

B000KCHZK6|3.0|I have Norah's first two CDs, COME AWAY WITH ME (which I adored) and FEELS LIKE HOME (which was okay - had a few cuts on it I enjoyed), and I was pleased to hear that she had yet another one coming out. After hearing \\"Thinking About You\\" for the the first time, I loved it, and had already planned to buy the new CD. However, after hearing the rest of it online, I decided to hold on to my money for a while.<br /><br />The rest of the tunes suffer from mediocre lyrics, and I really miss the warm jazzy-folksy-soulful kind of feeling that was prevalent on COME AWAY WITH ME and to a lesser degree on FEELS LIKE HOME. It just isn't here on this CD. It's like she's simply going through the motions, just singing these songs because she has to produce a product for her record label. \\"Thinking About You\\" is the only song that really recaptures the mood of her first two CDs, with \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" a close second. This is where, I think, Norah's past ability to effectively blend multiple genres may have worked against her this time around - like she doesn't really know which to focus on now. The recent death of super producer Arif Mardin (who was behind the first two CDs and had worked with many music notables in the past, like Chaka Khan and Aretha Franklin) has shown its effects here. He knew what was right for Norah and just what sound suited her. On NOT TOO LATE, Norah and her bassist boyfriend Lee Alexander take on the production duties. It's also pretty obvious here: she leaves a lot to be desired as a lyrical composer. This is an area where not every artist can excel in, and there's no shame in that. The reason why we loved COME AWAY WITH ME and FEELS LIKE HOME as much as we did is because the majority of the tunes on those CDs were written by other people. I feel she would fare much better if she allowed others who are more capable to write original material for her, or do her rendition of classic tunes. Not to say that she doesn't have the potential to develop into a decent songwriter, but for now, an entire CD of self-composed material isn't her forte.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like Norah; I think she is talented. Her voice is a welcome repose from what we are hearing from these so-called vocalists out here today. I normally love the intimate sounds of her music, but NOT TOO LATE just doesn't do it for me this time around. I really wanted to love this CD, but it is a disappointment in comparison to her first two. I can understand the need to change up a little bit rather than to stick to what made her popular in the first place, but you know what they say: \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\" I don't think this is indicative of what her true potential is. Hopefully her next CD will give us something new to marvel at, but not to the extent that we wouldn't want to listen anymore. I will patiently wait for its release, because I believe Norah has a lot more to offer us as an artist.<br /><br />Rating: 2 1/2 starsgwriter, but for now, an entire CD of self-composed material isn't her forte.

B000GIXEIG|3.0|Beowulf and Grendel had beautiful imagery with its locale shoot. <br /> <br />Beowulf and Grendel had a fresh and good idea. <br /> <br />Beowulf and Grendel starred Gerard Butler, who is going to become a huge star in the upcoming megamovie 300. <br /> <br />But unfortunately, that's about all this movie has going for it.  <br /> <br />Slow and sometimes dismally boring, Beowulf and Grendel could have been a low budget classic if the script would have been better. <br /> <br />But for fans who love this type of story and genre you have two saving graces coming to the big screen. The first is the March premiere of the ultra-cool 300 movie. This will make tons of cash, and make Gerard Butler a huge megastar. <br /> <br />The 2nd is the upcoming huge flick by famed director, Robert Zemeckis called: Beowulf. I trust this awesome director to remake a classic story to state-of-the-art special effects and solid plot.  <br /> <br />Believe me, it will be big.

This being said, it is nothing but a pity that Battle of Corrin was ever written. <br /> <br />Let me start out by saying that describing a planet-wide space battle does not make the said space battle exciting. The original Herbert didn't have to rely on cheap attention-grabbing ploys; he was so good at capturing attention that he even left much of the 'action' offstage. <br /> <br />Ok, so Frank Herbert is dead and there is no one even remotely like him left in the world of sci-fi literature. It would be selfish and even downright idiotic to asume that his son and Kevin J. Anderson could come anywhere close to him in terms of writing. That does not mean, however, that they should not be exempt from two glaring faults: <br /> <br />1. A ridiculous premise that comes very close to flatly contradicting the original Dune material. The Butlerian Jihad, from my understanding, was NOT a literal struggle between humanity and sentient, malicious machines. It was instead a semi-religious movement that purged computers from society. Making the Jihad into a literal war is blatant and cliche; I could have re-watched the Matrix if I'd wanted to experience that. The original Herbert was all about subtelties and hidden meanings, of which there are none in Battle of Corrin. <br /> <br />2. A shameless set-up to the likewise awful 'Hunters of Dune.' So Omnius sends out probes and a mysterious 'signal' into the unknown universe, does he? As I read that, I groaned. The simple plotline of Humanity vs. Omnius carelessly tosses the six originals to the wind. The dune universe is about the Atreides and the spice, NOT thinking machines that could have come from B-movies. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the six original Dunes, I'd recommend not buying this one. In all likelihood, you'll be disappointed.
B000GGSMB2|5.0|\\"Scarface\\" is the story of the rise and fall of Cuban refugee Tony Montana, who comes from the gutter and soon becomes a drug lord in Miami.  The look of this movie perfectly captures the excesses of the 1980s.  It's also a uniquely American film, a rags to richs immigrant story, albeit not of the typical American dream.  <br />  Al Pacino plays Montana in an over the top performance.  Although not altogether souless, Tony has few, if any, redeeming qualities.  He's both repelling and mesmerizing to watch, with his obnoxious personality and utter lack of class or refinement.  Maybe this is why Pacino is so watchable in this movie.  He portrays Tony almost like a cartoon character, \\"the bad guy\\", as he describes himself, with his white suits, profanity, and, of course, the infamous scar over his left cheek and eyebrow. I don't know a Cuban accent, but Pacino chose his and kept to it throughout the duration of the film.  <br />  Michelle Pheiffer plays the world weary Elvira, mistress of drug lord Frank and later the wife of Tony.  She's a gangster's moll, but a bored and discontent one.  From her emptiness eventually rises a loathing for Tony following a marriage that has stifled and disgusted her.  When she throws a glass of water into Tony's drunken, stoned face in the restaurant scene, she finally shows some self-respect by walking away. \\"How DARE you speak to me that way!\\" she explodes, previously dead eyes flashing with rage and hatred.  And then she leaves him, severing her pipeline to cocaine and all the trappings of drug wealth.  It's a gutsy and terrific performance. <br />  Not for the faint of heart with its violence, and certainly not for young children, this film is a stark journey into the dangerous, depraved world of drugs and crime.
0805076476|5.0|I love all of Chuck Palahniuk's novels. I admit I saw the film version first so I had to read this. I loved the premise. I loved the irony. The quotes. The way it made you think. This is an amazing book that has a very strong cult status among millions. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the modern nihilism that surrounds all of Palahniuk's books.
1400032717|4.0|Here is a fascinating book written from a very unique view point.  This story felt to me as though it started out rather slow, but quickly became very captivating and fascinating to watch Christopher, the protagonist with his very unique struggles that most of would have a hard time relating to.  Christopher explains to his readers why he behaves the way he does and why he feels so strongly about certain things, such as the colors red, brown, and yellow.  We find out why he loves math so much, science and the universe, and his feelings towards many other things that come into his life.<br /><br />An awesome book that I recommend to people of all ages, Mark Haddon has created a memorable character that despite his troubles has a lot to teach all of us about autism and what things are like in this world.  I recommend getting this book, having the whole family read it, and discuss!  It's truly unique and awesome.<br /><br />Thanks Mark!
B000J6I0VG|4.0|As a comic book fan I am fairly critical of movies based on the topic of super-heroes. This one was very fun to watch and poked fun of every super cliché you can think of. From giant robots to very thin disguises of the true identities of the heroes. If you are a comic book fan particularly of DC Comics you'll really get a lot of the more subtle jibes. Keep in mind that this is a film for all ages and in the classic Disney style. There is no crude humor and no scathing satire but it is still funny and great for the whole family.  <br />As to the Blu-Ray Disc, it functioned with beautiful picture and sound quality as expected. There were a couple of glitches toward the end, but I was not 100% sure if it was the disc or my player. These things are common with a new technology.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Classic Dylan. <br />Excellent!  <br />I recommend this to anyone who likes the poets music.
B000024D4R|5.0|Although Roger Water's writing always had a bit of an edge to it, the ideas expressed on Animals (1977) are probably his most bitter (along with those on The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983)).  Of the series of albums released during the 1973-1979 timeframe this is perhaps my favorite; I really like the combination of the spacier passages and the harder, more \\"rocking\\" sections.  Animals also demonstrates that Roger was beginning to exert nearly complete dominance over the band.<br /><br />Conceptually, the album is only very loosely based on George Orwell's classic book Animal Farm and there are some marked differences; on the album, corrupt capitalist systems are the focus and in the end, the sheep win rather than giving into the pigs oppressive rule.  The concept unfolds over three longish tracks (Dogs = 17'04\\"; Pigs = 11'22\\"; and Sheep = 10'24\\") and two shorter tracks that \\"open and close\\" the album.  In contrast with the anger and heaviness of the three main tracks, the shorter acoustic tracks Pigs on the Wing 1 and 2 are much more sentimental and emotionally tender.<br /><br />Musically, this is a very strong album that combines the Floyd's trademark spaciness with a hard-edged sound that was not typically associated with Pink Floyd.  Although I think the mix of the spacey sections and the heaviness work, it is (was) clear that the atmospheric Pink Floyd sound was on its way out.<br /><br />I recall reading in Nicholas Schaffner's book Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey (1991) that Roger Water's dislike of his audience rose to a peak during the 1977 \\"In the Flesh\\" tour of the album.  So much in fact that it was documented that he would shout out the number of shows completed during each live performance (apparently he could not wait until it was over) and even went so far as to spit in the face of an audience member in the front row.<br /><br />With respect to the 1994 remastering of this CD, it is OK and features the lyrics and art taken from the original record, along with some additional publicity photos (mostly of the inflatable pig floating above the Battersea Power Station).<br /><br />All in all, this is an exceptional Pink Floyd album that reached No. 3 in America and is very highly recommended along with Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967); Meddle (1971); Obscured by Clouds (1972); and Wish you were Here (1975).h some additional publicity photos (mostly of the inflatable pig floating above the Battersea Power Station).    All in all, this is an exceptional Pink Floyd album that reached No. 3 in America and is very highly recommended along with Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967); Meddle (1971); Obscured by Clouds (1972); and Wish you were Here (1975).
B000J103YI|5.0|I definitely recommend this album to anyone who recognizes raw talent. This album finds its way down to your inner soul.
B00005A0V0|5.0|This 1971 album is easily the most cheery and upbeat record that I have in my collection.  It is an excellent example of the pop/prog side of the Canterbury scene (which is actually more diverse than most would make it out to be), is both warm and inviting, and boasts some solid musicianship - in short, this is a fantastic recording that brings me a great deal of enjoyment.<br /><br />The core musicians on this album comprise what I consider to be the definitive Caravan lineup: Richard Sinclair (bass, acoustic guitar, and vocals); Pye Hastings (electric/acoustic guitars; vocals): David Sinclair (Hammond organ; mellotron; backing vocal harmonies); and Richard Coughlan (drums and percussion).  Joining the band are Jimmy Hastings (flute, tenor saxophone; and piccolo); and David Grinstead (cannon, bell, and \\"wind\\").  All of the guys are good players although I have to say that Richard Sinclair is the best:  his bass work with Caravan, Hatfield and the North, and Camel is excellent.  Richard also has a great singing voice, as does Pye Hastings and their vocal approach works very well with the material.<br /><br />I think that of all of the Canterbury bands (and other English progressive bands active at the time), Caravan stuck closer to the \\"pop song\\" format.  Because of this, you will neither encounter the use of staggeringly complex time signatures, nor odd chords and root movements.  Instead, the pieces on In the Land of Grey and Pink feature very pleasant melodies, and are mostly mid-tempo, without any jarring or experimental passages.  There is also the classic Canterbury sense of humor, as evidenced by song titles such as Golf Girl and \\"Hold Grandad by the Nose\\".  Most of the tracks on the album are in the 3-8 minute range, with the single exception of the massive 22'40\\" Nine Feet Underground suite.<br /><br />This remastered album features the original (and excellent) album art with loads of informative liner notes.  The bonus tracks include several tracks that should have been included on the original record (e.g Aristocracy), whereas the remaining bonus tracks are simply alternate takes/versions.<br /><br />This is a great album lumped under the Canterbury scene and is very highly recommended to folks that do not mind a less technically-oriented approach to prog rock along with the excellent For Girls who Grow Plump in the Night (1973).ould have been included on the original record (e.g Aristocracy), whereas the remaining bonus tracks are simply alternate takes/versions.<br /><br />This is a great album lumped under the Canterbury scene and is very highly recommended to folks that do not mind a less technically-oriented approach to prog rock along with the excellent For Girls who Grow Plump in the Night (1973).
B00003CXCT|5.0|I recently rewatched the entire Star War trilogy ('Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' & 'Return of the Jedi', in that order) on cable TV, which I had watched in the cinema in the late seventies & early eighties.  'Star Wars' movies have never ceased to entertain as well as inspire me from the very beginning & I have always thought that they provide valuable learning points, especially in terms of life (survival) skills.<br /><br />Among the three movies, I would like to single out my favourite, 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK', especially some related scenes involving Luke Skywalker & the Yoda Master. [The story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo & his sidekick, Chewbacca, the droids R2D2 & C3PO, Princess Leia and the rebels didn't end with the destruction of the Death Star in the earlier movie - it continues in 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK', where the battle to save the galaxy from the evil Darth Vader rages on.]<br /><br />Luke was unable to get his X-wing fighter out of the swamp. Yoda, using the Force, effortlessly got it out of the swamp. Witnessing the scenario, Luke remarked: \\"I don't believe it!\\". The response from Yoda was fast & to the point: \\"That's why you fail!\\"<br /><br />A lot of the times in life we fail to achieve what we have set out to do is because we fail to believe we can do it.  This is very true, especially for kids & teens when they encounter stumbling blocks or set backs in their path to achieving their fondest dreams.<br /><br />That's why, Anthony Robbins, a top-ranked peak performance coach in the industry,& author of 'Awaken the Giant Within', often shares this profound observation in his books as well as his Mastery University seminars:<br /><br />\\"Personal breakthroughs come from change in personal beliefs!\\"<br /><br />When he was nineteen years old, Arnold Schwarzenegger, came to United States with only a dream & a belief that he could become Mr Universe. [He achieved the title five times.]  He revealed in his autobiography, Education of a Body Builder: \\"As long as you can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it - as long as you really believe it 100 per cent.\\"<br /><br />There are other interesting learning points from the Yoda Master: (Here are just some of them)<br /><br />- Yoda: \\"Conbtrol, control. You must learn control!\\"<br /><br />- Yoda: \\"You must unlearn what you have learnt.\\"<br /><br />- Yoda: \\"Size matters not...\\" (as he responded to Luke: \\"I can't. It's too big!\\")<br /><br />- When Luke yelled: \\"All right. I'll give it a try.\\" The rebuttal from Yoda was fast & furious: \\"No. Try not. Do or do not! There's no try.\\"<br /><br />Even the primary antagonist in the movies, Darth Vader, has something to share with all of us:  His character trait of laser-focused, singled-minded, dogged determination to pursue & wipe out the rebels - no matter where they are -is worth emulating! Although he deservedly failed at the end, he practised what he believed!<br /><br />So, Mums & Dads out there, if you want your kids & teens to learn valuable life (survival) skills, go & watch the Star Wars trilogy with them!t you can do something, you can do it - as long as you really believe it 100 per cent.\\"    There are other interesting learning points from the Yoda Master: (Here are just some of them)    - Yoda: \\"Conbtrol, control.

B000H0MKGK|3.0|I found the first two albums interesting- full of great chord changes.  His second one, while a little less accessible to many showed him stretching his songwriting and sonic chops some more.  John is a great guitar player and was showing signs of becoming an even stronger songwriter until this album, which is hopefully just a slump.  Most of the tracks are just too predictable.  One track has almost identical chords to 'Sexual Healing.' Although the hooks are catchy they are more like commercial jingle hooks; when I heard the first single off the album I expected a voice-over to start up and try to sell me some cholesterol medication.  The production on the album, like his others, is very high-end.  I guess I can appreciate Mayer's desire to show off his bluesy side, i.e. that he can really play the guitar, but I hope to see him get back to exploring some more interesting things on the next release.
B000002KKS|4.0|After I bought my ticket to go see the 2007 Heaven and Hell tour, I ordered the cd of the same name. I am a big hard rock / metal fan, but I never actualy bought a Black Sabbath cd. I heard some of their stuff and Dio too. In short, this cd rocks. Great guitar riffs, catchy tunes and great vocals. Heaven and Hell is my favorite tune on it. I highly recommend this classic. I should kick myself for not knowing about this cd sooner!

B000002GJS|4.0|Wow,that is pretty much all I can say after listening to this CD.The songwriting on here is absolutely amazing.In fact I came real close to giving this a 5 star review (which I very rarely give) it really is that good.<br /><br />Bryan Adams has the perfect voice for good time rock and roll,you won't find any show offs in this band either,every instrument fits the songs perfectly as does Adams' voice<br /><br />The CD starts off strong with 'Is Your Mama Gonna Miss Ya' and just stays strong throughout,sure there are some hits that you've heard over and over like 'Do I Have To Say The Words' and (everything I do) I Do It For You,and Can't Stop This Thing We Started,but I honestly believe it is the songs that didn't get as much airplay that make this a 'must have' CD...I truly can't recommend this highly enough...the lyrics are cleaver and it's obvious thought went into them,my favorite song on here is 'There Will Never Be Another Tonight' but really every song is a classic and deserves a good listen...I can't end this review without mentioning the producer 'Robert John Mutt Lange' who definitely put his touch on this CD (he was the genius behind 'Highway to hell' and 'pyromania' not to mention most of the 'shania twain albums' in fact on most of the songs here you can almost hear Def Leppard doing these songs,no the music isn't nearly as heavy as Def Leppard but the vocal style of Bryan Adams sounds very very close to Joe Elliot of Def Leppard...this CD ROCKS!!!<br /><br />The Upside - Every single song,the production is top notch,and the band and Bryan himself know how to play perfectly to a song rather then show off,the songwriting is the real star here,Bryan Adams is a master and most anyone in the industry could learn a thing or two from him<br /><br />The Downside - There really isn't any,if I would have one small comment it would be that at 15 songs the CD does run a bit long but with songs this good you don't really feel bored,most other artists if they were to release 15 songs it would put you to sleep,but Bryan pulls it off<br /><br />The Bottom Line - If you love good time music,stuff that you can dance to and smile this is for you...I recommend it very highly...run out and buy this,especially at this price you won't regret it..donutman says so!!!ase 15 songs it would put you to sleep,but Bryan pulls it off <br /> <br />The Bottom Line - If you love good time music,stuff that you can dance to and smile this is for you...I recommend it very highly...run out and buy this,especially at this price you won't regret it..donutman says so!!!
B000JJRIN4|4.0|I have to say at first I was not a huge fan of this CD.  But, give it a chance.  The sounds are def. not the normal pop sounds you would expect from other mainstream acts, but the songs are unique and have an amazing new sound to them.  Overall I think the tracks are pretty varied while being enjoyable.
0618680004|4.0|The God Delusion is written by Richard Dawkins, an evangelical atheist.  Dawkins appears gifted more in liberal arts than at natural science. Delusion demands scientific literacy from debating antagonists.       Dawkins claims historical figures (i.e., Einstein) as co-atheists (page 13) while quoting Einstein on page 18 as admitting to being a believer. Dawkins complains that religionists unfairly claim great minds for their own.  However, some would surely not appreciate being labeled atheists by Dawkins!      Dawkins excels at highlighting historical, moral and rational contradictions of major monotheisms. His arguments are difficult for any theologian to debate. That said, Dawkins fails to argue his thesis that God is nonexistent. Dawkins' arguments arise from obsolete science. (19th century, Newtonian paradigm)       Is Dawkins seduced by his academic success? He masters evolution but fails larger perspectives of science. Seeing the world through optics of a narrow education, he fails Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Not understanding the micro or macro-universe Dawkins thinks electrons are little Newtonian Bb's. Dawkins marvels with incredulity as his own colleagues label him \\"so nineteenth century.\\"  Duhhh! They are correct!  Dawkins views are launched from an obsolete Newtonian paradigm. Dawkins would be a detractor of Christopher Columbus predicting his fall off a flat two dimensional earth.  For credibility Dawkins looks to Carl Sagan, another very articulate but antiquated scientist who never grasped the universe beyond three dimensions. In short, Dawkins is a philosophical lightweight.      Reality consist of one's lens of perception AND the actual ongoing or \\"dance\\" we call the universe. The micro-world of quantum suggest the dance may not even exist without our conscious perception. Matter and consciousness are codependent.      Dawkins lauds the beauty of scientific laws and credits them for evolution creating life. He never questions how the perfection and truth and scientific law came into being from a realm \\"outside\\" of space-time.     Dawkins disregards the Cosmological (cause and effect) Argument with an \\"infinite cause\\" counterargument. He does not understand \\"cause\\"  precedes \\"effect\\" in time. Time is necessary for cause-effect.  Time-space was created with big bang ... therefore \\"cause and effect\\" did not exist as we know it before creation.  Dawkins' counter-argument is nonsensical.       Dawkins talks of \\"raised consciousness\\" evolution. Correct, many fundamentalist reject evolution with no comprehension of it.  Evidence for evolution is overwhelming and beyond dispute.  Still, it is easy to \\"force fit\\" evolutionary explanations for anything biological.  Dawkins arrogantly rejects possibilities of there being more to reality than our senses can perceive!       Dawkins discusses one single prayer study showing patients suffered when prayed for. Truth: prayer studies overall have found positive correlation's. (New England Journal Medicine)      The body of human knowledge is minuscule compared to what is not known. The \\"not known\\" may be infinite. Claiming logical deduction for existence OR nonexistence of God is arrogant. Arrogance is ignorance from not realizing one's limitations of human senses and sensibility. You understand nothing ... until you understand what little you know.       Seasoned academics are skeptical keeping quackery at arms length. \\"If it can't be, it isn't.\\"  Mostly a wise stance. However, if Einstein, Heisenberg and Feynman held the stance, where would we be?      There are scientific paradoxes that suggest/prove a reality with more than four dimensions. Three angles of a large triangle (i.e., triangulating stars) total more than 180 degrees. (due to curvature of space-time)       Twin photons emitted from laser heated calcium crystals are forever connected transcending space-time. Affecting one photon (polarizing lens) affects the other simultaneously. This holds true light yearsapart. Light particles have non-geographic connections.  Light seems to exist \\"outside\\" space-time.    Consider time running backwards and forwards in subatomic realms. Photons receive other free photons donated by an electron BEFORE the electron donates it. (You catch the ball BEFORE I throw it!) This is time is running in a direction we arbitrarily call reverse. Someone please explain these things to Dawkins!      Pages 316-18 reveal Dawkins personally. Dawkins suggest child molestation is harmless while the Catholic Church is victim to a witch hunt. Dawkins confesses to be a victim of child sex abuse calling it \\"embarrassing but otherwise harmless.\\"  He describes a girl fondled by a priest being left with only a \\"yucky feeling\\".  However, the same girl was permanently crippled from church inspired fear of hell.  Dawkins is a rabid defender of homosexual marriage and gay rights, never acknowledging organized religion's support of the family. You decide where his anti-religion virulence springs from.      All said, you have to like Dawkins' passion. His book is a check and balance to many opposing books that require one not to think!

B000002MUW|4.0|After the \\"Erotica\\" album, because of which the critics nearly crucified her, Madonna put her emotions in front of her sexuality and released this wonderful album. It sports mostly ballads, which have never before in her career been so deep, insightful and cathartic.<br /><br />\\"Bedtime Stories\\" begins with a very r'n'b oriented track, \\"Survival\\", which can be interpreted as a sort of an answer for the critics' mean response to \\"Erotica\\". It becomes evident that there are some new features in Madge's music now, as the tracks sound fresher and more radiant than her previous tracks. They are also more sophisticated - \\"Secret\\" embraces the feeling of the streets without jeopardizing Madonna's iconic status, \\"Human Nature\\" is both cheeky and polite, and \\"Love Tried To Welcome Me\\" stands out as maybe the best track on this album, as it truly sounds like a lullaby, with its calm sound and warm lyrics.<br /><br />Although this is a rare Madonna album to sport some filler tracks (\\"Don't Stop\\", \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\\" and \\"Bedtime Story\\"), the fillers never get in the way of the overall mood of the album, as they are great tracks too. This is truly a concept album, and as such, it's great for romantic moments, lounging on Saturdays or... bedtime.
B000KC86F4|3.0|First of all, it was too short.  At 104 minutes, there is hardly enough time (as the movie shows) to develop the dozens of characters that are a) introduce and b) have disappeared.  Major characters are simply written off or ignored.  While Wolverine is my favorite and certainly takes the lead role along with Jean Gray, Storm, whom I would describe as one of the least popular characters, even though played by a very attractive actress, is pushed to the forefront (rumor has it because because Halle Barry threw a fit about her small roles).  Characters are introduced and lead you to believe that they will serve a purpose, then you don't see them again for an hour, at which time they make a 10-second appearance.  Also, the pseudo-goth mutants that Magneto takes on as his proverbial \\"posse\\", are laughable.  The 'no one understands me so I'll wear all black and cover myself in piercings' has worn very thin.  All these things aside, i did have a problem with the final fight scene with Magneto and Pyro - like they couldn't find anything better to do than toss burning car after burning car for 5 consecutive minutes?  Magneto was infinitely more diabolical in the first two and has taken a serious step back.  I did, however, enjoy the Wolverine/Phoneix part.  This movie would have been GREAT - had it been the first movie in the X-Men series, but, as the third in a series of who-knows-how-many films, I really expected a little better.  Either way, this movie was still a million times better than Superman...
0783117523|4.0|Welcome to the world of fashion, glamour and money. \\"Gia\\" is an HBO movie about the supermodel Gia Marie Carangi, starring Angelina Jolie in her first major role. It is an interesting movie about an interesting person, wonderfully directed, shot and acted-out, that you may wonder at times, is this really a TV movie?<br /><br />Gia was a beautiful young woman, who grew up wanting her face to grace covers of fashion magazines. She will succeed in this, however, her eccentric and wild life will make this story a tragic one. Angelina Jolie is perfect in this role. She achieves to be both a fighter and a vulnerable child and one could argue that she is not an actress, she is an embodiment of this superstar. She and the co-stars (especially Mercedes Ruehl, who plays Gia's mother with just the right dose of bitterness and love) make this movie very worth-watching, despite some of its flaws. From time to time, you may feel like you've seen some scenes already, or that the focus on the story is lost. However, with the stellar cast and amazing direction (Michael Cristofer manages to pull off scenes that are both playful and dramatic, which reflects Gia's inner conflicts perfectly - the scene with the Geisha photoshoot is pure art), \\"Gia\\" is a movie to be watched at least twice. The true star of the movie is Jolie, of course, and it is not hard to see how she landed an Oscar for \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" and world-wide fame in no time.
B000L212HC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and would rate it as the second best movie I saw in the theaters last year (after The Departed).  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play very convincing roles and succeed brilliantly in drawing you into and submersing you in their endless cycle of revenge.  Does this movie have some small plot holes?  Yes.  Does it leave some questions unanswered?  Yeah, but, overall, this is an enjoyable roller coaster ride and is much darker than I anticipated.  I've never been big on magicians, but this one definitely had me saying \\"wow\\".  Somewhat predictable and somewhat off the wall - this one definitely leaves you wanting to make peace with people.
B000FDECGA|4.0|Well, if you have a little extra money and have not seen Lone Wolf and Cub, but are not sure whether or not you'll like it, BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!  Shogun Assassin is basically Lone Wolf and Cub 1 & 2 edited, dubbed, and handed to you in a nice ULTRA-FAST PACED bundle.  I have yet to see the full series, but having seen this I am very eager to.  Lone Wolf and Cub is longer and much more conclusive.  I suppose you could also make this purchase to tide you over while saving up for the full set, haha.  If you are very compelled to know how it ends, there is a second Shogun Assassin, but as I said, there is also a larger series that has all of this and more, just not in English, which may be a disappointment to some.  There isn't really much moral plot to this, other than perseverance, but it's still an entertaining hour and a half of blood flying absolutely everywhere, as it says, \\"It's impossible to keep a body count!\\"  I also highly recommend this as a gift for any loving parent to their 4-year-old (not really!), but it's enjoyable for the older crowd, as long as you don't have any reservations for mindless violence.  Once again, I will enforce, SPRING FOR \\"\\"\\"LONE WOLF AND CUB.\\"\\"\\"
B000F9RB8A|4.0|I really didn't know what to expect out of this movie when my buddy got it from netflix two years ago and brought it over.  I've never been much of a fan of martial arts films, but this one definitely had me rolling.  This film is riddled with slapstick humor that will either have tears of joy or or regret rolling down your cheeks.  My wife did not enjoy this movie, but it definitely has a spot reserved on my DVD shelf.  If you think you'd enjoy a cross between \\"The Simpsons\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", will more than likely get a kick out of this movie.
B000024D4R|5.0|I recently got a new copy of Animals, since my original copy got lost. I have always liked this album a lot. <br />I think it is one of their most musical albums, without being played to death. I could not really say which one is their best album, as that is really a matter of personal taste. I like this one because it is their most guitar-jam oriented.  My thoughts.. <br /> <br />Pigs On The Wing 1: short, more of an album opener, than a real classic Floyd song. <br /> <br />Dogs: This to me is the heart of this album, great bluesy guitar work from David Gilmour, and a lot of just great musical moments in general. I like the way it changes feel several times in the song. Good lyrics too. Considering this song is 17 plus minutes, it never falls flat or gets boring, thats the test of good players. <br /> <br />Pigs (Three Different Ones): I like it, but it is pretty played out on radio, it seems I some how hear this song almost every day, on every classic station, and evan on satellite radio. I will say it is a good song though. <br /> <br />Sheep: My second favorite, lots of great moments, from the spacey keyboard intro, to the heavy middle section, to the end guitar section. This one really goes places. Some of the best keyboard playing that Rick Wright has ever done. <br /> <br />Pigs On The Wing 2: much like first version, I guess this is the album closer, to tie it altogether <br />lyrically. <br /> <br />Evan if you don't like Pink Floyd, I think they really are very good musicians, and make a lot of unique music, that few others would attempt. I won't go into details about the concept of the lyrics, <br />because so many others have here. It really think it is great.
1587263963|3.0|...However not nearly as bad as _Sense and Sensibility_. The characters seem a little less sterotypical here, and while _S and S_ was harshly critical of the snobbery of the upper class the main heroine in _Emma_ is herself one of these people, which makes it interesting. She is a busy- body who meddles in the affairs of others and thinks she alone can judge the motives of everyone else with exactness. Although she is very proud, she is not overbearing or mean (except to those she snubs) and we like her.<br /><br />The plot doesn't hold much to it, though. It is filled with what has become typical plot devices of the romance novel-- the comedic misunderstandings between people as they miss each others meanings completely, as well as the \\"knowing/not-knowing\\" and the \\"does she love me/love me not\\" devices which are utterly over-used and stale to most contemporary readers. Perhaps these were fresh in Austen's day. That to one side, even the plot itself was too simplistic and much too easy to see through. These shortcomings combine to leave the reader with a sense of tedium. It does not \\"work\\" today, classic or not.
0226264211|5.0|This book is a terrific presentation of economic truths.    As a minor note, this book was written many decades ago in the post WWII era and there is a bit of content that addresses the ridiculous laws that were in effect at that time.   Specifically, it was against the law for private citizens to own gold bullion at that time.   Friedman does take liberty with the notion of how counterproductive such laws are from an economic point of view.    As someone that wasn't alive during that era (I was born in 61), it was a bit strange reading a book that referenced so much that was so alien to me. <br /> <br />Excellent read and certainly a true classic in economic understanding.

These leftovers from Radiohead just show the diversity of the band, alternating from techo to pop to semi-prog.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big fish is a movie that takes you on a visual journey on the lines of \\"Wizard of Oz.\\"<br />It is the story of a Father who has told the Son a lot of tall tales his whole life. (The movie does a splendid job on bringing these tales to life)<br /><br />As the son grows up, he feels totally alienated from his Father, because he does not have the slightest idea of who he really is. His whole life, in the son's eyes, has been one big fish tale.<br /><br />Through all these tales, we see Edward Bloom (The Father) from sliding down a hospital corridor as a baby, to time literally standing still as he meets his future wife,to him meeting a witch who predicts how he will die , to him meeting Karl, the biggest giant in the world.Also we get to visit the little town of Specter,a town so friendly and laid back, that you must take your shoes off and throw them over the telephone line just to enter!<br /><br />There are many adventures,and though the special effects are wonderful, there is a deeper lying love story of mother-father, father-son underlying in this story.<br /><br />The story is visually stimulating, and part fairy tale, part truth. It is sad, yet serious.<br />But it is thoughly enjoyable to watch.<br />It is also a tear jerker too, so make sure you have kleenex at the ending.<br />I highly recomend this movie to people of all ages. You will love it!

The movie itself is pretty lame, an hour into the film you want to choke her character, a seriously annoying chick who steals, ruins people's property, and dresses like an escapee from the mental ward. Somehow we are to believe a rich goodlooking guy actually falls for this loser. Not cute, not funny, just annoying. Anything after \\"Susan\\" was downhill, but in \\"Susan\\" she played herself. \\"Who's That Pest.\\"

B0001Z37HM|4.0|When i was a kid I had two main heroes, He-man and Conan well and maybe JOhn Wayne and Vincent Price!!  I am now 24, I always loved the Conan films they are in my top five fantasy films, always enjoyable to watch, The first Conan is great, the 2nd was good more kid friendly and then theres Red Sonja, It's more liek Conan the destroyer, its pretty good but not as good. I still enjoy it, it is what it is!  Its a film you either like ot dont like. As a kid my dad had to rent it over and over,The last time I had seen it I was maybe 8 years old. I just recently puchased it two days ago, and I have to admit those old kid feelings came back, and if a film can do that it's gets a good grade in my book.
B0000024UF|5.0|This classic album was a favorite of mine through the 70's, and it's a favorite today.  Cohen sings my revolutionary soul.
B000LC55F2|3.0|The movie starts as very intersting and builds up a puzzling,  intelectual suspense (how do they do it??) but in my mind evetually fails to deliver. Most of the promised twists toward the end are quiet expected if you've seen enough movies in your life. Another problem is that both main characters are so cold, calculated and ruthless, to the point that makes it very hard for the viewer to feel sympathy and identify with either of them. Without giving away important details - the fact that the movie eventually picks 'a winner' (in a twisted, perverted way)looks arbitrary and while the last scenes try to convey some 'happy ending', they leave the viewer with a bitter after taste. <br />The comparison to 'The Illusionist' is naturally unavoidable. In my mind The Illusionist is better (even if not perfect), mostly because he preserves the 'mystical', illusional aspects of magic, instead of taking us into the boring (and sometimes cruel)technical details of its implementation. In addition, the main characters are much easier to understand and sympathize with.
6305622914|5.0|This is a great movie from the UK.  It still makes me laugh everytime I see it.  Since they speak European English, some of the terminology is difficult to understand, but if you watch it more than once, everything becomes clear.  It is a good story about how far a father will go to keep seeing his son.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I feel foolish for having bought this one.  Norah #1 was great, Norah #2 was bad (with some flashes of greatness), but this is....well.....amateurish blather.  The song lyrics have all the complexity of a high school diary (at least most diaries don't have really bad rhymes in them) with a level of musical sophistication to match.  Her voice is tired, lifeless, and wearing.  I am embarrassed to say I've bought all three CDs and am as guilty as anyone for assuring that Norah #4 will be out in two years and will once again make mega-bucks for her record label.

B000001G89|4.0|Abbado's 1977 Carmen dates form his fruitful early phase with the London Symphony, when his conducting was, if a bit tame at times, still fresh and engaging. He gained extra priase for casting two Spanish leads in Berganza and Domingo, but Carmen is French through and through, so that's no a vlaid advantage. In fact, Domingo's French is only passable, and what we have is another in a long line of Carmen recordings made without benefit of idiomatic Gallic style.<br /><br />There are so few French Carmens, in fact, that one can't hold it against Abbado that none of his major singers are native speakers/singers. This is about par in three Karajan recordings (with Simianato, Leontyne Price and Agnes Baltsa), the much-loved Beecham (with de los Angeles), the Pretre (with Callas), and so on. The best of these employ French singers in minor roles as well as in the chorus.  If a French singer pulcks a major part, it's usually as Escamillo.<br /><br />Like most rugged collectors, I swear off Carmen every fivee years or so, only to add a few mor4e recordings when the itch comes--this is, after all, a perfect opera in its way. Didn't Wagner admire it? I know Tchaikovsky did. In any event, the Abbado isn't high on my list.  The Karajan/Price recording has a wildly inappropriate Don Jose in Franco Corelli (who doesn't even attempt French, merely making up syllables as he goes). Sherilli Milnes's Escamillo is also innocent of French pronunciation, but he does sing at his best here, with a minimum of shouting.<br /><br />For me, the real problem is teresa Berganza, a lovely but mild-mannered singer who firmly places Carmen in a seduction-free zone. Nor does she exhibit much anger, doom, or revenge.  Abbado, too, seems content with a smooth finish, as does his British chorus. Which leaves only Domingo firing up for Don Jose, which he does admirably. He's in best voice and compares with the very best in the Flower Song as well as the final confrontation with Carmen.<br /><br />I think we sitll await an revelatory French Carmen, and in the meantime all sorts of international hybrids will have to do, including this fine but not exciting one from Abbado.nk we sitll await an revelatory French Carmen, and in the meantime all sorts of international hybrids will have to do, including this fine but not exciting one from Abbado.

1401308201|5.0|I'd heard about the idea behind this musical and loved it and when I'd heard how well it was doing on Broadway I thought that I really needed to hear the recording. Boy, am I glad I did because it now rates as one of my favourite musicals. <br /> <br />Sadly though, I live on the other side of the world, therefore options to go and see the musical are slim, therefore discovering this book was the best thing for an avid fan like myself. <br /> <br />I loved reading about the process of making the musical from adapting it from Gregory Maguire's book to getting the sets and costumes made. I loved the interview format because it made it very easy to move through the pages. The illustrations are gorgeous and the soft, aged looking cover makes it even more special. There are some beautiful photos as well and interviews with the cast. There are excerpts from the original novel as well as early drafts of the score, all of which add to the excitement in seeing how this wonderful musical came to be. <br /> <br />If you're a massive fan or you're not going to see the musical for a very long time (until you can afford tickets to New York or London, that is) then this is the book for you!
0618680004|1.0|It is interesting that one may use the label of \\"scientist\\" as a sort of qualification to comment authoritatively on subjects out of his or her pervue. One of the defining guides of a good scientist (or doctor, engineer etc.) is that it is unethical to give professional opinions on subjects for which you lack the proper credentials.     The question of God is ultimately unanswerable as a matter of cold, logical fact; evidence may render unlikely certain interpretations of manifestations (of word or deed) and processes of logic based upon postulates acceptable to the masses may choose which \\"flavor\\" of religion becomes a major force, but God's existence cannot be proved or disproved. This book, if written by a scientist as an extension of his profession, is merely bad science.     Dawkins view that the idea of God be rejected because of the horrors perpetuated in the name of religion, and that science should become the keystone to the guidance of our lives does not have much validity. Mankind has perpetuated horrors in the name of science (genocidal purges have been conducted and excused by so called \\"science\\")--science may provide glimpses of fact and possible causal relationships but it provides no way to translate these glimpses into moral action. In the last analysis, Dawkins proves himself more a bigot trying desparately to legitimatize his hatreds than a rational scientist with humanities' best good in mind.
B000JJRIP2|4.0|Who hasn't got Alive 1 and 2 as 2-CD remastered CD's ? Now remastered AGAIN (how often can you 'remaster' a recordinbg ???) both discs sound as good as ever but both as single discs this time. Alive 3 has a bonus track originally only available outside the USA and the only 'new' thing here is disc 4, the over 6 years old Millennium show. A bit of a disappointment as this disc plays only 1 hour and many more songs from that show could have been included on this CD. The packaging however is something that Kiss is very good in: \\"How to make old stuff hot again?\\"... by putting the discs in an amazing packaging with a perfect thick colorfull booklet for a VERY nice price.
B000IU3XU6|3.0|Although another great vocal performance, his song selections are not up to expectations set by previous CD's from the performer.  The accompanying short (33 minute) DVD is not worth the additional price.  Reccommend vocal CD purchase only.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This is a two disc studio album that is actually more like two separate albums in one single package.  The first disc consists of 5 unrelated songs with the longest being over 13 minutes and the shortest just over 6.  The second disc is a 42 minute conceptual piece called \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" that is broken down into 8 sections.  After the excellent \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" I was prepared for a letdown with this one, but incredibly Dream Theater is able to pull off another excellent album.  Of the two discs on \\"Turbulence\\" I find the first one slightly weaker than the 2nd.  This is not to say that the material here is not good, in fact for the most part it is outstanding.  The album opens with the 14 minute \\"Glass Prison\\" which presents a brutal heavy metal assault on the senses dealing with the subject of alcoholism.  \\"Blind Faith\\" and \\"Misunderstood\\" are both great songs with killer riffage and hooks.  \\"The Great Debate\\" is the weak track in my opinion.  It deals with the debate over stem cell research and clocks in at a hefty 13 plus minutes.  This is one of those songs that people really love or don't like at all.  For me it is not one of Dream Theater's better moments.  Disc one closes with \\"Disappear\\" which is probably one of the more experimental tracks that the band has done.  It comes across with an almost Radiohead vibe to it.  You wouldn't think that this would work with a band like Dream Theater, but I am happy to say that it does.  Disc two is where things really come together.  The 8 part \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" concept piece is in many ways similar to \\"Scenes From A Memory\\".  Each track deals with the subject of mental illness through the eyes of several different characters.  The opening \\"Overture\\" instrumental reminds me somewhat of Kansas.  The rest of the disc is for the most part more melodic than disc one and is full of hooks and choruses that won't leave your head.  Track 5 \\"Solitary Shell\\", with it's chorus of \\"Monday morning lunatic\\" could have been a single it is that catchy.  The disc ends in grand fashion with the build up to \\"Loosing Time / Grand Finale\\" that leaves the listener with a full symphonic progressive bombastic conclusion that draws the whole thing to a close.  Although I don't think this album is quite as strong as \\"Scenes\\" it is another outstanding effort from Dream Theater.
B000IJ79V6|4.0|WELL I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE END   HOW EVERYTHING GET BACK TO NORMAL  EVEN THOUGH THE TOWN HAS BEEN DESTROY    OTHERWISE  I LOVE THIS MOVIE  EVERYTHING IS PERFECT
B000HIVO64|5.0|It's still the same Beck music: the style where creative riffs and drum solos mix with a bit of synthesizer. Add in some high-quality sound recording, and you've got 16 impressive tracks.  <br /> <br />But by Beck's standards, it's not exactly \\"impressive\\". <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong--the album is great. But to compare the October release of The Information, Beck hasn't exactly \\"upped\\" his production. In fact, it sounds almost exactly like his 2005 album, Guero.  <br /> <br />By now, Beck seems to only want to impress crowds. Harsh? Yes. But in my eyes, it's true. He performed the same routine on his world tour that he did in Bend Oregon's Les Schwab Amphitheatre.  <br /> <br />I was there when the crowd had to wait an extra 45 minutes just because of technical problems with the live video feed to show dolls dressed up as the band perform in the same way the band was on stage. Confusing? You bet. The audience paid nearly $30 per person to see Beck live--not the dolls.   <br /> <br />I wasn't the only one a little discouraged that summer 2006 night. <br /> <br />Even though Beck hasn't turned The Information into something new, it is still a great cd. With a Flaming Lips-like sound, Beck experiments and takes chances--something you don't see too often in popular artists. The leaps the band takes are usually winners, too. <br /> <br />The Information sounds like Radiohead... Thom Yorke, to be exact. It still maintains that psychedelic pop-like rhythm, yet ventures into a new world of, shall I say, \\"synth-hip-pop.\\" \\"Elevator Music,\\" the first track, displays the quick words of Beck--almost sounding like the cd's single. \\"1,000 bmp\\" (a.k.a. \\"1,000 beats per minute\\") sounds like an LCD Soundsystem knock-off (but not in a bad way).  <br /> <br />After listening to the cd a dozen times, \\"Cellphone's Dead\\" is always the one track to stick in my brain. With its European and cow bell sounds, it catches attention. Good attention. Beck's so-called single, \\"Nausea,\\" bringsme back to when I saw him live. This song gives me the perfect picture--the one of him with his cowboy hat and acoustic guitar in the front of the stage while the rest of his band members exercise the long list of instruments behind him. It was almost distracting. Again, in a good way. <br /> <br />Is it horrible of me to say the last song is one of the best on the album? I mean, the best songs are usually the first, second, fourth, or fifth tracks. But the last? It's true. \\"Inside Out\\" is probably the perfect ending to Beck's rise to ruining $30 shows, but making up for the so-called disturbing experience by showing the crowd he really does have talent, no matter the number of dolls on stage. Of course, I say this in a good way.   <br />
B000BYRCH4|4.0|I enjoyed this alluring film.I found it to be very interesting and thoroughly engrossing. The cast (Paul Walker, Josh Brolin and Scott Caan) was refreshing.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|Any thoughts that Dream Theater might be getting soft, as it's members move further into middle age, will be quickly dispelled by the material on this album.  \\"Thought\\" is simply the heaviest most brutal offering the band has produced in their almost two decade career.  The album's closest comparison would probably be \\"Awake\\" from 1994, but even that album has significant differences from this one in tone and form.  Let there be no doubt that this is a guitar album.  Everyone in the band is, as always, in top form, but guitarist John Pettruci really gets to shine in spots on this one.  When I first got \\"Train\\" I was somewhat disappointed, but this is an album that grew on me with each listen as I succumbed to it's dark charms.  Initially I would have given it a lukewarm review, but after numerous listens I think this is yet another outstanding piece of work from the Dream Theater boys.  This album has divided a lot of Dream Theater fans.  Some love it and some hate it.  I have to give the band credit for trying something different.  Although this is still very much progressive metal, parts of the album have more in common with Metallica, Megadeath, or even Pantera then with Rush, Kansas and Yes.  In fact several of the tracks you could almost swear it is Megadeath you are listening to instead of Dream Theater.  The album even delves into Nu Metal territory at times; although most Nu Metal bands only wish they could play half this well.  Even with these more heavy influences this is still very much a Dream Theater record.  The tracks \\"As I Am\\", \\"This Dying Soul\\", Endless Sacrifice\\", \\"Honor Thy Father\\", \\"Vacant\\", and \\"Stream Of Consciousness\\" are all rock solid.  The band saves the best for last with the album closer \\"In The Name Of God\\" a 14 minute epic masterpiece that is the highlight of the album.  This one tackles the subject of violence / war in the name of religion and resonates appropriately with today's headlines.  Overall I don't think this is the best DreamTheater album, and it will not necessarily knock you out on first listen, but give it a chance and see if it does not creep up on you with it's not so subtle charms.

I have played it numerous times and quite honestly don't even find myself paying any attention to it. <br /> <br />Perhaps this will begin a change in direction that will lead to more stellar artistry that she is fully capable of producing. All artists eventually produce sub-standard material during their career and I am not completely giving up on Ms. Jones yet... However, I probably would not have purchased this CD had I heard it prior to purchase. I pre-ordered it from Amazon before it was even released. <br />

B000JK8OYU|4.0|Taking my son back to school 01/14/07 I heard a Nashville radio broadcast with both Mr. Martin's speaking of this compilation. The thing that impressed me most was George Martin referring to The Beatles' music as The Holy Grail, and what he felt he could and couldn't do with it! With reverence like that from a producer some forty years afterward, who would dare not pay homage to this selection. I've listened to it several times now. Catching the various songs is sometimes a challenge. The combination of various songs is a very natural processs. Sometimes it's like sitting in the middle of a room with Beatles music swirling all around you. \\"Turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream\\". It is simply magnificent, but it becomes a completely unbelievable experience when heard through headphones. If you lived through Beatlemania, this CD is a must! If you didn't, listen to what you missed.

Metaphors and similes stretched so thin they were almost breaking.  I thought if I had to read ONE MORE thing about stars and fire and how brave and strong the father is I was going to lose it.  And the son, Jesse, is every mild-mannered woman's image of the \\"rebel\\" kid.  Give me a break.  There are so many coincidences in this book it makes Jane Eyre look realistic.

0790743507|4.0|This has to be one of Ellen DeGeneres's favorite movies as she loves to dance at random.  It is the best movie with so much pantomime that I have ever seen.  People that try to copy a lot of pantomime really go over the top as in movies like Justin and Kelly, and as I've heard a lot of Indian movies as well.<br /><br />This movie is a bit cheesy when the portion of everyone just telling you to dance occurs, and the movie is left hanging for Lena as apparently it's not important how her life ends up.  In terms of a storyline, to not mention Lena's end to her part of the story is good.  It does leave the impression of how people that talk funny can't do well now that sound has come out.  Since they don't even show Lena in a good light throughout, it makes it seem even moreso that life is so unfair for her.  You have to feel a bit sorry for her character in the movie.  There are a few people that talk really funny and do pretty well in show business, but it is a rare sight, that is for sure.<br /><br />All the coordination for the tapping styles to the right beat and rhythm, with all the bends and twists of both Kelly and O'Connor.  O'Connor is known for his backflips in the movie, insane!  The performances in this movie are all top-notch.

It was easy to make a purchase on Amazon, and the delivery was prompt.You have guidelines provided to help the consumer make an informed decision on a product. \\"I'll be back\\". Sincerely,  Patrick Dwyer
0767827902|5.0|Directed by Peter Bogdanovich this is a true piece of Americana and what filmmaking is about. \\"The Last Picture Show\\" is truly a classic. <br /> <br />It stars Cybill Shepherd, Ben Johnson, Jeff Bridges and Cloris Leachmen. All of them would have tv and movie careers some more successful than others. Bridges plays Dwayne a country boy/ football player in a small country town. His best friend is Sonny, played by Timothy Bottoms, who is also a country boy/ football player.  They're not really good football players (like the NFL players) and they get told that they're not good by their peers and friends in their small town. <br /> <br />Sonny's girlfriend Charlene resembles the easy, yet hard to figure out Anglo Saxon girl. He eventually breaks up with her to be with anolder woman.  This older woman is actually the wife of his coach, but since his coach hardly gives her the time of day, she seeks a good younger man who can satisfy her. <br /> <br />Cybill Shephered playes Dwayne's girlfriend, J.C., a rich, insecure and often shallow white girl. She at first comes on as sweet as innocent, but that sweetness rapidly disappears when she goes to a nude swimming party with Lester a loser of a man played by Randy Quaid. <br /> <br />J.C. is just like her mom, bitchy in tone, gets mixed up with men that don't love them,and then complain later on why they're lives are messed up. This is a classic movie, in showing people in a small town sometimes  act. However, most of the characters especially Sonny show heart and soul, along with Dwayne as they grow threw the tough times growing up, that would shape them up to be strong respectable men. <br /> <br />Dwayne joins the army to fight in Korea, and Sonny overcoming many obstacles begins to change for the better. <br /> <br />This movie is the classic coming of age story but really resembles so much more too, the 1950-1960's were a turning point in how Americans see themselves. The performances are all outstanding including CybillShepherd, Jeff Bridges, Cloris Leachmen and Timothy Bottoms. The DVD is packed with many special features and is well worth buying to see more information about this classic film. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AGTPUU|5.0|There is nothing better during the Christmas Season, than snuggling with the grandchildren to watch this captivating movie!  The animation portrayed and the imagination it generates is priceless! <br />Grab the popcorn and cranberries to string, sit by the lights of the tree, and prepare to be taken away to a wonderful place!!  <br />
B00064WSNW|5.0|Fripp spent 3 years after he broke up Crimson in 1975 studying the works of JG Bennett. Well, he really reinvented himself here with a new and improved version of Crimson. The tragedy is, it's one of the best records of the 80's that I'll bet not many people have ever heard!
B000MGTQ7A|5.0|William Holden may be the star of the film but Alec Guinness leaves an indelible image as British Colonel Nicholson. William Holden's character and predicament almost seem secondary to the central plot. The true substance of the story lies in the conflict between Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa as Japanese Colonel Saito and the morality of British soldiers building a bridge for the enemy to the best of their abilities. The bridge is central to the plot and it takes on symbolic meaning as both a monument to British ingenuity and the inept weakness of their Japanese captors. Malcolm Arnold's score is most memorable for his use of Kenneth Alford's \\"Colonel Bogey March.\\" This full is full of indelible sights and sounds. The unique look of the bridge structure over the River Kwai, the \\"Colonel Bogey March\\" and the scene where Alec Guinness falls on the plunger of the detonator box rigged to blow up the bridge have lived with me ever since I saw this film as a kid. That was a longtime ago, a time well remembered that only exists in my memory now.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|If you were a big fan of Alias,  you will love this box set.  I especially like all the Bonus features with bloopers and deleted scenes.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Charmed is my favorite show, so I have all of the DVDs. This isn't my fave season, but it's still fun to watch. I highly recomend them all!!!
B000GG4Y32|5.0|One of Diane Keaton's very best efforts, and Warren Beatty's well-deserved Oscar for Best Director. A great film that wears well with age.
B00064WSNM|5.0|They came a long way from the Moonchild improv 5 years prior to the recorded live Fracture & Starless improvs. The improvs are now their strength instead of the weakness. This may be their best
B000957O82|5.0|This is a very entertaining, amusing and outright funny film with heart. The trailers did not do this film justice. Will Smith is HITCH the \\"Date Doctor\\" for males who just want to get the girl of their dreams as is the case with Kevin James. Others clients are not so noble of heart. In the mean time HITCH is also trying to get the girl of his dreams. I liked this film immensely because the script is well thought out and the bottom line here is that these guys envision the girl of their dreams as someone they want to be with and love for the rest of their lives. HITCH's intentions are based on good old fashioned notions of what it means for a man to love a women and the commitment that goes with that.
B000286S8S|4.0|I picked this collection about a year ago, and I played it again last night, and It really is a great collection. Best of Volume 1 was good, containing most of the radio hits, and the 2 new Diamond Dave songs, but this one gets their greatest radio hits and the radio staple songs such as poundcake, jamie's crying etc.  It also features 2 new songs with Sammy as well, nice touch. Finally, it includes a couple of live songs from the sammy days as well of van halen classics, not bad, still not Dave on those songs. Sammy and Dave, I actually like both of the guys catalogs with the band, and in fact kinda prefer sammy. This collection covers them both though.  I agree, the package notes were cheesy, mainly used to hype the new tour with sammy, and dave was not to find in the pictures.   Finally, I think for completion sake they could have included a Gary Cherone song from van halen 3, at least \\"without you\\",  But fans backlashed that album bad, so it's been swept under the rug for good.  Oh well, this is the best one stop set for Van Halen songs, worth the money.  It does lack \\"Ice Cream Man\\", I guess well have to wait for another collection to get that song included on it, I'll just have to get that album in the meantime.
0780020693|5.0|Amarcord is such a wonderful and rich trip for the senses.  This is the great director, Federico Fellini's look at his childhood in 1930s Fascist Italy.  We see a great depiction of the ups and downs of his youth.  The imagery has much to do with the essence of Italian culture and the experiences of a young man as he witnesses life, death and all passages in between.  This surrealist journey shows such love and warmth for the unpredictablity of life.  I was especially impressed with the coincidental and juxtaposed approach to the incidents that take place.  They aren't so much episodic, as interconnected.<br /><br />I think that this is a great coming of age film.  I found myself laughing and pondering.  Truly timeless.....
B00064WSN2|5.0|1. Peace-A Beginning - Already out of the band, Lake does a favor and sings beautifully here and on this album. IMO Lake, McDonald and Giles should have taken a break instead of breaking up after 1 album and tour.  <br />2. Pictures of a City - 21st Century Schitziod Man Part. 2  <br />3. Cadence and Cascade - Not a good track sung by the (embarrased to have been in Crimso) Gordon Haskell  <br />4. In the Wake of Poseidon - Epitath part 2, Melotron by Fripp  <br />5. Peace - A Theme - Forgettable Guitar theme  <br />6. Cat Food - OK, but well its just OK  <br />7. Devil's Triangle: Merday Morn/Hand of Sceiron/Garden of Worm - Here we go, the deep sea set to a nightmare of music, thats a compliment. THis would of fit nice on the debut instead of the long improv jam <br />8. Peace - An End  - Goodbye Greg Lake <br /> <br />
B000063V8R|2.0|I am actually watching disc 6, second episode and I must say that the picture and sound quality is really bad (getting worse by the disc it would seem). The DVDs do not look any better than what I saw on TV the first time those episodes aired!  You also occasionally have sweeping horizontal bars from bottom to top of the screen and the soundtrack volume sometimes goes down. I use a brand new iMac 24\\" to view those DVDs. And truth be told, I found the quality of the Rat Patrol first season DVD set to be superior to ST:TNG considering the fact that The Rat Patrol was the very first color show broadcasted on ABC, in 1966. Expect of course the \\"new special collector digitally enhanced remastered\\" version (with tons of extras naturally) of those DVD sets soon because that is the Paramount way... suck them trekkers dry! I also bought season 4 which I will view eventually but I don't expect any better than season 3. Laters ;-)
B00003CXCW|5.0|Truly one of the great movies, this one hasn't dated at all. In fact, with two strategically placed sex scenes and a couple of curse words here and there, this could have been made in 2006. This is a classic example of a great story told in a great way supported by great performances and great sets. And although the DVD could have been a Double Disc, with a more comprehensive documentary, it still remains a solid affair, the transfer and quality of the film itself warranting five stars simply on their own.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|I was very impressed with the DVD.  With bands like Queen, Elton John, Brian Adams, and all those other ledgendary bands, this is the complete DVD.  What is better than a live concert with some of the world's greatest artists on one stage.  Those artists are the artists we look up to today. <br />They play some of there most famous songs, and the concert is structured to be very balanced between all types of music.  It is great to watch all the popstars of today when they were so you, and to be able to see those artists whom you have only heard of. <br />It is really an excellent DVD, and at this price, really worth purchasing.
B00065MDS6|5.0|Best track here is Lizard: Prince Rupert Awakes/Bolero-The Peacock's Tale/The Battle ...   - featuring Yes's Jon Anderson on guest lead vocals. this track is worth the price of admission for Prince Ruperts Lament/Fripps searing guitar solo at the end of the track before the fade out of backwards sped-up mellotron
B000E1MTY0|5.0|This was bought as a gift! my husband loves the movie and loves the clarity of the high dfinition
0062502182|1.0|I read this a couple of years ago. I was struck by just how awful it was. Usually I can find some redeeming qualities in any book, but not this one. Seeing this on the \\"best seller\\" list made me have to comment. To tell the truth, I can't at this point even remember anything about this book except its awfulness.
B00005JPKC|5.0|I agree with the previous observations about the movie. The development of the characters and the story is excellent. There are no winners in war and the two opposing sides were indeed very much alike.  We have learned to understand this with all our past enemies and this film does a wonderful job of reinforcing that fact.  The beginning and ending are creative and tie the historical event well to the present day. <br /> <br />Another excellent accomplishment of this movie was it's technical merits.  If you have ever studied the Pacific war, the Iwo Jima battle, and the Japanese Army and Navy the following was quite accurate: <br />1. Scene/battlefield orientation was very accurate.  The initial Japanese headquarters in relation to the beach and Suribachi, the refernece and scenes of Suribachi survivors moving North to join Japanese forces, tunnel systems , etc were all nicely done.  There may not have been an exact sense of time felt by the viewer familiar with the battle but that was okay to me - it was a confusing battle and both sides were under immense stress so I actually enjoyed the aspect of 'losing track' while viewing it.  <br />2. The manner in which the Japanese talked to each other was refreshing - not so much that it was in Japanese, but the subject matter and manner of communication among and between ranks was well done.  I smiled during the conversations and was happy to see a movie filled with accurate dialogue. <br />3.  The uniforming of the Japanese was perfect.  For years, I have watched movies only to be disappointed at seeing a non-Japanese ammo pouches, an incorrect shoe, field caps with an odd shape, incorrect movie prop helmets, bad insignia, shirts, tunics, holster, belts, and packs that don't resemble Japanese military issue combat gear.  There is more technically correct uniforming in this movie than the majority of public will ever appreciate.  If you want to see what a real Japanese army and navy combat soldier looked like - see this movie! <br />4. The movie did a good job of exposing the viewer to some of the conflicts that existed between the Japanese army and navy during WWII. Conflicts that often resulted in needless loss of life within their forces resulting from lack of communication,  mis-communication, delayed and/or flawed decisions between and involving the two branches. Also, a hint of the disapproval of Kuribayashi's defense strategy among the senior ranks was presented well - not too excessive, but just enough so that viewers could understand some of the personalities and thinking within the Japanese military on the island and throughout the Pacific war - well done. <br />5.  Weapons were accurate for the most part also. Particularly the Arisaka rifles, Nambu pistols and Light Machine gun, anti-personnel mines, Type 97 grenades, etc - whether real or props, they were well presented.  There are a few gas bombs, and technical flaws in the air attack and the terrain might be a little questionable in those scenes.  Also, a better job should have been done on the large spigot mortar and some of the Japanese soldiers/extras did not appear to be well trained (as a Japanese soldier during the 40s) on the use of their weapons. More weapons training from period documents and further research from veterans would have solved that.  Overall however, these were minor problems and again, not noticeable by the majority of the viewers.. <br />  <br />I've always appreciated Eastwood's work. I only wish I knew Mr. Eastwood and/or had connections to be utilized on this movie and contribute as a technical advisor.  Perhaps, I will have the opportunity to contribute on another Pacific war film project. There's no excuse for sacrificing highly accurate technical details in important movies like this and Mr. Eastwood was obviously aware of this.  This movie accomplished its purpose and will DEFINITELY be a classic.  A wonderful piece of work!! <br />
B00065MDRW|5.0|Maybe the best and shortest band lineup of all time that created a prog masterpiece. I have one question, why does this album always miss those top 100 albums of all time lists (the ones where Revolver always wins \\"sigh\\").     1. 21st Century Schizoid Man (Including Mirrors)- According to Fripp the song supposedly about Spriro Agnew. The middle part is pre-Mahavishnu genius ensemble jazz rock, way before it's time.      2. I Talk To The Wind - Nice vocal duet by Greg and Ian and jazzy playin by Fripp, then all of the sudden the tympani rolls and ......      3. Epitaph (Including March For No Reason/Tomorrow And Tomorrow) - The best song of all time? It may be, Ians Melotron here is the star. Sounds like a good Moody Blues track X 10        4. Moonchild (Including The Dream/The Illusion)  Backwards guitar starts this short 2 minute number followed by a very long instrumental (vibes/jazz guitar/mute drums)improv. It's long but it's a perfect lead in to...        5. The Court Of The Crimson Song (Including The Return Of The Fire Witch/The Dance Of The Puppets) - More Melotron and the Greg Lake choir,   the best vocal performance by Lake ever. Drumming here by Mike Giles is immaculate.
B000K9L32U|5.0|Incredible. After ten long years the boys with the golden voices and beautiful souls have returned to fill the world with beautiful music once more. I would be lying if I said I wouldn't think it better to have all five of them together again but that is the way it goes sometimes. No ill will towards either camp. I adore them both. It makes a warm feeling in my heart to see my boys back in action, to know that there are new sounds to listen to. For those not familiar with thier music know that it is a combination of blended harmonies, romantic love songs, and smooth adult contemporary sounds. They have grown from the teenaged boyband and evolved. Now if I can just get them to release in America and to tour here. Le sigh.
0790729725|5.0|In 1990, I remember sitting in the theatre before 'Goodfellas' started and expecting nothing. Afterward, my friend and I looked at each other with a mutual surprised expression -- \\"That was a great movie\\" . Scorcese is an incredible storyteller and, 'Goodfellas', like 'The Sopranos', has received such critical acclaim b/c of the believability of the characters and the creative way it is presented. A lot of the dialogue in the film was adlibbed by the actors, more realism. Excellent film.
B00011F5DK|3.0|I should give it more stars because I have a lot of friends that like to play it, but this is my opinion. I like to play it occasionally, and it is worth having, but I wouldn't consider it a great game.
B000003S0P|5.0|This album is best played loud and red lined! This is the best crimson since the debut and a great way to end the first phase 69-74. <br />It's ironic that this is mainly a three piece band after David Cross's leaving prior, he left us his best work \\"Providence\\" another amazing live improv.
B000ICM5IK|4.0|Well I bougth because I wanna have all colection but, the disc has all same songs, just one new, (its a fight from 3 six mafia) and its not good enought.  The disc is missing very good songs like Mesurement of men  (from Rocky V), War & training in the montange (From Rocky IV). <br /> <br />I recomended if you don't have the others,  insert some comments from the movies was good point
B0007OASII|5.0|I am normally a fan of more aggressive metal, but when I found this cd it simply blew me away! The singer has the most incredible, clean voice you will ever hear, and there is enough energy in the cd to make the slower tracks like abandoned and momento mori (my personal favorite clocking in at 9 minutes) easier to appreciate, not boring moments that I skip. Definately recommended for practically anyone!
B000MVN8HE|5.0|Veronica Mars is my favorite show currently on television. Although the show has been focusing more on Veronica's romantic relationship than in the past, the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode. The writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show. The acting for the most part is top notch, and Kristen Bell, who plays Veronica, is amazing. I especially enjoyed Episode 9, Spit and Eggs, in which Veronica figures out who has raped her fried Parker and at least two other women on her campus.
B000059HAI|5.0|\\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" is a really fine flick that still holds up well decades after its release. It tells its story in fine detail and with little or no mythologizing. It also has a much slower build up than most movies today. That suits the subject fine, but war movie-makers today seem to think their audiences need a whiz-bang beginning or they'll lose interest. <br /> <br />\\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" seems mostly aimed at American audiences, but it was a joint American and Japanese production.  One of its strengths is that it goes much further to humanize the Japanese than the more typical US WWII war-film-as-propaganda of its day and earlier, especially in the character of Japanese naval commander in chief, Isoroku Yamamoto. (Clint Eastwood goes further still in \\"Letters From Iwo Jima.\\") Still, \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" portrays Yamamoto to flatter American audiences, showing him as holding grave doubts about the wisdom of going to war against the US. But other Japanese also are shown as individuals and not caricatures. We understand their motivations and can sympathize with them, even as Americans on the other side of the conflict. It ends with Yamamoto's (presumably fictional) words (here in paraphrase), \\"We have awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve.\\"
0307237699|5.0|There is one chapter that tends to be a little long winded but the book as a whole is great! I love the easy language, insight and directness with which B. Obama writes.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This was a gift for my wife who absolutely loved it. The set came in on time, without damage and was just as good as if it had been bought at a local retail store. With the exception that it cost less to buy through amazon.
B000I5X81K|3.0|I have to say, after waiting over 2 years for his third album to be released, I was dissapointed in this one. There are only three or four tracks I like vs. loving almost every song on the first and second CDs. I love tracks 1 and 2 (they did take a few listens before I liked them), but those are the only ones that I really want to hear on a regular basis. But even those don't hold a candle to half the songs on Closer, like \\"Remember When It Rained\\" or \\"Oceano\\". Even the songs that sound more like his traditional music leave me wanting because they fail to showcase his voice in the way that all of his other foriegn-language songs did. They don't give me chills or move me to tears like the other album did. Closer is by far his best work in my opinion.  <br /> <br />The english language songs, except track 2, don't stand out very much to me. They don't showcase his vocal power and instead focus on softer high notes (don't get me wrong, he still sounds beautiful, but I miss his full vocal power and when every decent song is sung in this new higher tone it makes me want to go pop in Closer instead). The lyrics also fail to move me, and at times leave me wondering why Josh would choose such mundane songs and arrangements. This album is definitely very different then the first two. I know he is capable of so much more and it bothers me to see him waste his talent on boring, superficial songs.  <br /> <br />I don't like the eclectic pop sound he seems to be exploring with this album, and at times when listening to this disc I am frustrated by all the drums and beats and rhythms and backup vocals that do nothing but cover up and take away from his beautiful voice. It seems like he was focusing on composing songs, showcasing other musicians, and creating a more eclectic almost jazz-pop sound during the making of this album instead of what made him famous in the first place, his flawless, soaring voice.  <br /> <br />Please bring back the amazing, powerful Josh Groban with the big, ambitous songs and gorgeous orchestra arrangements! If he continues down this path he will probably lose some of his fame and fan base. I will always buy his music because he's Josh Groban, and I think he has the most gorgeous voice i've ever heard in my life, but I hope he goes back to Closer-style music. I loved that album more than words can say.
074356619X|5.0|I've already seen the DVD of The Secret, but this audio book offers some additional resources to create the things that we really desire in life.  For people who are ready for change and willing to apply \\"The Secret\\" to do it, it's awesome!  This is a great overall resource that explains how the Law of Attraction works and answers some important questions in relation to how it works.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|I love your work I will watch anythig that has you in it, simply because you are in it, and in my mind you are a fantastic actor.  However this movie I could not make it through, three times thus far I have sat down to watch it, not including once in the theatres, and everytime no matter how loud the speakers, or bright the screen, I was unable to stay awake.  I have not yet given up on it, but at this point in time I am forced to say this film takes you three stops passed the boresville station.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|this is a much darker story line and the older children like it because its border line scary
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban has an absolutely stunning, gorgeous voice. I love this album. In my opinion this is by far his best work. I have had this since it came out and still listen to it on a regular basis, he is the only vocalist who sends chills down my spine and tears to my eyes even when I can't understand a word he sings. I also had the pleasure of seeing him live for the Closer tour and he was even more breathtaking live. Just flawless, incredible singing all the way. His baritone voice is masculine and powerful while he is also able to hit very high, sweet notes like a tenor with amazing control and precision.  <br /> <br />Buy this album now! Even people who don't like this style of music have to appreciate a voice as rare and beautiful as this one. He is able to bring classical music and great singing into mainstream popular music without cheapening his vocals or the quality of his music.
B000065VA1|5.0|THe most accessible of all Gabriel's work, with tunes that move your feet body and soul.  And you know you really liked the dancing chickens in the video.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, every minute, was well thought out, and therefore inturn well enjoyed.  There is action, there is plot, there is love, and drama.  This film has it all.  Although, I must say this, when sitting down to watch this movie, one must be prepared to devote 100% of his or her time to it, for there are several speeches, and lines of V's character, that are not to be missed, some even comical.  So be prepared to watch this film on a night when the kids are out, your elderly parents, are locked firmly in their basement, and all animals, are in the kennel, (ha Just joking) and you are looking for some real entertainment.  Buy this film, watch it often, and tell me what you think.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Three different topics: <br /> <br />Movie:  Great.  Not for kids, only adults that act like kids.  All political values, regardless of side, lampooned.  Kim Jong Il would even crack a smile. <br /> <br />Shipping.  SUCKED!  Paid for fast delivery. Never showed.  This was a gift and the recipient was disappointed.  No help from shipping company.  No internet tracking.  Huge disappointment. <br /> <br />Customer Service (Amazon).  Great. Stepped up to the plate and refunded the shipping charges. <br /> <br />Customer Service (Dynamex-shipping company).  Poor.  Sad.  Dismal. Huge disappointment.  No internet tracking, rarely answered phones, couldn't look up tracking number.  Need I continue?
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is the classic \\"feel good\\" love story.  Perfect for a valentines gift to watch with your loved one.  I rate it as one of my top favorite love stories of all times.  Will definitly bring a tear to your eye.
B000I2IT44|5.0|This is a great DVD. Produced well, great sound, and really captures the essence of the tour. If you saw the concert, it will allow you to relive the experience. If you didn't you will get to see what you missed. The music can be haunting but strangely uplifting at times. The second disc providing music videos run at the concert plus other specials puts this at 5 stars for sure. Love the Cymbal Song! If you are a Porcupine Tree fan, or even just a progressive rock fan, I highly recommend this DVD.
B00063F8B2|5.0|Quick to receive.  Only slight thing I noticed was a crack in the cover but the CD itself was in perfect condition.
0887307280|5.0|In 1996, after spending everything I had and 5 years of my life -unsuccessfully - trying to build my Investigations/Security business, I was given a copy of this book by my (then) accountant.  To that point my personnel issues were both rampant and consistent, I was wallowing in debt and despair and ready to throw in the towel.  I should mention that I had spent several years working for one of the oldest and largest management consulting firms on earth in a direct client contact position - I thought I knew business backwards and forwards.   <br /> <br />As I devoured the E-Myth, all the lights began coming on and my life and business took flight in new and exciting directions.  I have since purchased the book (as well as his follow up Power Point Business) in bulk and give them to friends and others who are struggling with their businesses.  It is required reading for Administrative staff here at Great Northern and if you own or manage a business - you  can't do without this book!
B00005JPKE|5.0|I am not going to write a dissertation here.  I saw his movie this past weekend and it is absolutely superb.  Beautifully photographed, technically and historically accurate, and it made you think just how bad this was for both sides.  The saying \\"Wars are fought by scared men who would rather be somewhere else.\\" really applies here.  Regardless how you feel about the Japanese in WWII, the individual soldier is just carrying out his orders and dealing with the possibility of death the best he can.  The actors were great and the movie kept your interest right up to the end.  Great job Clint!
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This movie was always a fun one to watch; however, after Katrina in New Orleans, it was the best comic relief on those days when it was all going wrong as we rebuilt the house. Love the movie!
B000M341QE|5.0|There has been much writen about Scorsese not ever having won an academy award for unforgetable films such as \\"Raging Bull,\\" \\"Taxi Driver,\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\", just to name a few. It's hard to believe, but then then look to see the other best picture nominees the year \\"Chariots of Fire\\" won the Oscar. Even those who don't agree about most films, will agree that ANY of the other nominees that year would have made for a more deserving winner. The starting point that I am trying to make is that good/amazing work is sometimes not awarded the acclaim that it should, but whether the Academy gets it right or not, we the public know is \\"best\\" as per our own appreciaton. I've learned to appreciate the work and put aside the awards hoopla that only serves as a point of departure for conversation about great movies.<br /><br />Is \\"The Departed\\" a great movie? You better believe it. I have not enjoyed a Scorsese picture this much since \\"Goodfellas.\\" The story is engrossing, the performances are captivating, and the execution is that of a director at the peak of his capabilities. While the movie is over 2 1/2 hours along, it seems to pass almost too quickly. It is worth noting that, like many Scorsese films, this one has graphic violence to boot and I would caution anyone to take kids to see this film, as some scenes are among his most shocking.<br /><br />While you may have read something about the plot. I am not big on revealing anything that might give away part of the joy of experiencing a movie which you know as little about as possible, but enough to get a gage as whether it's a \\"you\\" movie or not. I can tell you that both Matt Damon and Leonard DiCaprio give the best performances of their careers. I've never been a huge fan of DiCaprio, but they both surprised me and both are Oscar-worthy performances. Damon is growing into one of this generation's best. Not showy and always present. For some, Jack Nicholson can sometimes be too \\"Jack,\\" but with the exception of a couple of scenes (one of which is hilarious) he stays within his character. The supporting cast is flawless.<br /><br />The story itself challenges you to concentrate and keeps your adrenalin flowing PAST the last frame. Unlike some past Scorsese movies, this one injects a strong dose of humor between all the deception, double-crossing, and graphic violence. I saw this movie a couple of days ago and will be getting the DVD upon its upcoming release. At that time I may update this review to reveal whether the DVD has any extras worth noting.<br /><br />While I won't be watching the Oscars as I's rather watch the arrivals and hear the resesults the next day, I would not be surprised if this movie were to win honors for both best film and best director. If it does not win, it won't be for lack of deserving to as it's one of the best of the year. I give this movie an unqualified 5-stars. Just remember that there is a lot of violence and it and you may want to bring an oxygen tank as some of the suspence builds up to a point that you may find yourself gasping for air.e of scenes (one of which is hilarious) he stays within his character.

B000KCHZK6|2.0|I have all her 3 albums and this is the worst album among all. Some more I purchased the imported version from Japan, maybe my expectation of this album is too high and end up not that good. That's why quite disappointed here. Her voice still nice but don't feel any special of the songs. I like her first album the most and never bored of listening this album.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Movie delivered within 1 week. High quality video, not the poor quality that is seen on broadcast TV.
B00005ATQF|4.0|Very good portaral of early Vietnam era in the US. Movie was well done.
B000022TSW|5.0|It was wrapped like a new product.  The viewing was super.  It was a great movie.
B0000X61VE|5.0|The best I ever had! And believe me, I tried different workouts. You will see the results in a couple of months.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is the most powerful and understated movie of the last 50 years. <br /> <br />It points out to all of us what we and our predecessors have accomplished in our efforts to control the world and it's environment.  God did a good job on his own.  We don't need to improve on his accomplishments. <br /> <br />All persons who view this will discover how selfish they are because they want everything good for themselves.  We need to protect and preserve what is here.  We haven't done a very good job of either.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I am not a music snob, so any absence of a well defined groove or lyrics that don't necessarily match the times is of little importance.  Do I like it?  You bet.  Why?  I love her voice, the simplicity of the tunes, its not over produced, its just straight forward easy listening.  \\"Put Your Records On\\" is my favorite.  She just hits it well and its from the heart.  Its not dance music (unless you're horizontal, in which case it delivers).  Enjoy!
0062502182|4.0|i enjoyed this book very much and was considering passing it on to a friend as was done with me. i hadn't heard of any one not enjoying this book or feeling that it didn't help them, although i am young and so are my friends (relatively). overall i think this is a great book and feel that most people would enjoy it if they opened their mind to the possibility that they have something out there that they should be doing to fulfill their dreams/desires, and i think most people can find something to relate this book to. most certainly should become a regular for high school literary classes. <br /> <br />i hope you enjoy this book as much as i did.
B00005JL96|5.0|I've loved this film since it was first released but recently purchased the DVD for my 3 1/2 year old who is now obsessed with Hawaii, hula girls, space aliens and Elvis music.. She thinks that Lilo & Stitch is the best and I must agree. I watched the bonus features and very impressed with the amount of work that went into making this movie what it is. The story is very entertaining, the animation is gorgeous and I would imagine most parents would enjoy watching this as well.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Great storylines and character development make this set a must have for any sci-fi fan or fan of good television in general.  Lacking computer-generated graphics, the creators had to rely on their story telling to draw viewers in.  In this, they have succeeded most remarkably.  You won't find incredible effects or gross humor here, but if you're looking for fantastic tales of bravery, exploration, and humanity, you've come to the right place!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Everyone should have to watch this... starting with all of our High Schools!!!  We will all be a little more \\"green\\" after watching!!  It gives hope ... we can all help reverse this problem!
B000M06K5C|5.0|This album is a huge leap ahead for fans of Bloc Party. It is a concept album based on the isolation and lonliness that a big city brings, especially to twentysomethings. Kele Okereke, the bands lead singer has not left room for ambiguity in his lyrics, and that makes them all the more powerful. Bloc Party has created a record, not just a hit song which is so prominent in Top 40. Hats off to Bloc Party for superb songwriting and deliberate and meaningful lyrics.
0380778556|4.0|It was good but some parts were slow and sometimes the main characters shyness got annoying.  Other then that, it was very good.  I would recommend it if you are a fan of gothic romances like Jane Eyre.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I'm slightly puzzled by the negative reviews of this DVD set, which largely consists of the eight shows from 1995 reworked from the previously released videos. For \\"Anthology\\" read \\"Collage\\". The torn paper pictures which make up the box and sleeve graphics give a very good idea of the eclectic approach. It's not always clear who's talking or what the video footage is from. As has been pointed out, this is sort of a set for completists. Sort of. Other than some of the History of Rock shows from VH1, most of the popular culture shows I've seen have been done this way and some of them were very bad indeed. PBS is full of boring documentaries on everything under the sun which they get from a variety of sources, some as reliable as the rumor mill that is the Internet.<br /><br />That said, this is one of the few series that gets anywhere like behind the scenes.  A friend of mine who is a guitarist can't get enough of it and kept checking it out from the library and watching it over and over until we finally went half and got it (at a great price) from Amazon. Even given the atmospheric, amateur film school style, this set puts Beatlemania into context. You can't understand the music at all without knowing the part George Martin played, who is often interviewed here. The reflections of George Harrison and Ringo also prove invaluable. This series gives one of the few looks at the early Beatles, pre- Ed Sullivan, why they played the Cavern Club, why and when they were in Germany. It's the only footage I've ever seen of Richard Starkey AKA Ringo that shows his popularity before he met the other Fab Three.<br /><br />About the only angle this series doesn't touch on is that explored by Steve Turner in the recent book, The Gospel According to the Beatles. And there are, of course, bits of the puzzle yet to be put in place. For one thing, where is the Beatles cartoon show on DVD? Where is Let it Be on DVD? Don't you people have enough money that you don't have to fight over the rights to put these things out?  Please please me and let it be.r the rights to put these things out?  Please please me and let it be.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This album brings the Beatles back to old fans and new listeners in very unexpected ways.  The remixed music is rich and nuanced; the juxtaposed pieces are effective and moving.  \\"Love\\" has given my household great pleasure, but also the eerie sense of John's and George's living presence.
B00004RF8J|5.0|For horror/adventure, this kept me laughing.  The voice of the plany was terrific and his ongoing demands.  I LOVE Rick Moranis.  Steve Martin does a fabulous job as the biker.  And the ending will keep you wondering!!
B00008G8LN|3.0|My wife loves this movie. It's a pretty cheesy movie, but if you like Patrick Swayze, I guess this is all you.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Cinderella has always been my favorite story.  Life unfair to poor girl.  Poor girl meets Fairy Godmother. Meets Prince...happily ever after!  And though there is no fairy Godmother, the ability to believe beyond what you can SEE will carry us through!  GREAT job by Drew, Dougray, and...Well, yeah, Anjelica, too.  She made me not like her character, so she must have done a good job
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Haven't listened much to the Beatles in a while, though they were once a mainstay. I have really really enjoyed this CD. It's magical.
B000002JPA|5.0|Nuestros panitas de Dream Theater siempre asombran con sus buenos riff y complicadas piezas. Excelente material!!! <br /> <br />Recomendado...
B000E5KUK6|1.0|Yes I do own this movie and it saddens me as a diehard Godzilla fan. First off this wannabe is not Godzilla it will never be godzilla and I will know that.  In Japan this little bugger is called Zilla, if you want to find out this stuff go purchase Godzilla Final Wars and watch the true King of the Monsters crush this imposter like he's a bug.  This creature is never going to remotely be Godzilla in my opinion. <br /> <br />Some of the people who say they are diehard fans of Godzilla think people like me are nuts.  I'm not I just have watched Godzilla since the 1954 black and white movie.  Godzilla has a distinctive look a distinctive personality, he is supposed to be the ultimate incarnate of power and destruction.  This movie pawns Godzilla off as a weakling and a loser. <br /> <br />You want some advice stick with Japan Godzilla bad dubbing, some sad plot points at times, but still it is what I call \\"True Godzilla\\".  Especially check out the newer Godzilla's that go from I believe Godzilla, Mothra, and Ghidorah Giant Monsters All Out Attack.  Wrap it all up with Godzilla Final Wars also.  Those are good movies, this is a joke.  Even Toho studios thinks its a joke.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I, for one, believe everything that Al Gore said about our environment and the fact that we could be destroying it.  We are destroying it, and we have a crisis now for the entire planet to deal with.  It is really up to the United States to lead the way in the effort to clean up the planet, as we are the most powerful nation on the face of the earth and we are in a position of moral leadership as well.  I have made changes in my lifestyle in order to do my share and then some.  I believe that each person must make a personal commitment to solving this problem by doing his/her share in order to reduce the dangerous amounts of carbon on earth that will ultimately destroy the planet if unchecked! The time to act is now! Indeed, global warming is a very real danger that has been put on the shelf by a large number of politicians, both past and present.  This documentary will open your eyes and inspire you to want to take action. This is a cause that everyone can relate to and be a part of. Everyone should see this documentary.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Charles Lee Lamadrid
0671646788|5.0|I take this book with me on vacation every Spring and read it from cover to cover, because, it is the best book I own for rejuvenating my hopes and desires to succeed in business for my family and myself.
B0000DIXN7|5.0|I'd never heard of Amy Winehouse until I caught a free download of \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" off of her new album ..........  What a surprise!   That voice is so fresh and unique and her lyrics are actually smart, sexy, and funny.   I bought \\"Frank\\" right away and already ordered \\"Back to Black\\".  If you're tired of cookie-cutter pop and R&B and like to mix it up with some hip hop beats and some jazz and rock thrown in with a retro flavor then check out this album.   My favorite song is \\"In My Bed\\" which uses the same track as \\"Made You Look\\" by Nas.
B000I5X81K|5.0|When I got this, Josh Groban was relativity new to me.  We love his music and it exposes good quality to teens.  They seem to really appreciate his sound.
B000LE1FAY|5.0|These days, Belinda Carlisle is relying on her voice instead of the beat. This is absolutlely the best album of her 25 year career.\\"Voila\\" starts off with a haunting french cover \\"Ma Jaunesse Fout Le Camp\\"   Heaven is a place on earth!  Some of the best songs are the ballads, like \\"Avec le temps\\" \\"Ne me quitte pas\\" and my favorite \\"Merci cheri\\" It's hard to write a review for songs in a language i don't understand. But i do know that it's timeless and wonderful! \\"La vie en rose\\" is the best track here. It reminds one of Belinda's former recordings, but this time she's all grown up (48yrs omg). The last song \\"Jezebel\\" is a riot. Belinda hits and holds notes like she never has before. Overall, \\"Voila\\" is a triumph and everyone should have at least one copy.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins shows us once again why religion makes no sense, and has no arguments or evidence to support its continued existence.  A must read for everyone who is strong in their \\"faith\\", since after all, how much value does your faith really have if it is unable to withstand a rational challenge?
0743270754|3.0|The book itself was very interesting. However, the narrator, Richard Thomas completely buchered it. He mispronounced words all over the place, and was overacting instead of just narrating.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I'm from Argentina, I buy the item... and in seven days I receive it in Buenos Aires... EXCELLENT ALL!!! THANKS!!!!!!! TEN OVER TEN!
B000KCHZK6|2.0|Norah's debut was special, her second was a bit of a sophomore slump, but at least half of it was very entertaining. This is just substandard. Mainly the problem here is the songs, which are mediocre at best. Norah and her bassist/boyfriend can write good songs, they just can't write an album full of them. Plus here they seem to have had writers block, but continued to churn out songs anyway. Everything about this album sounds tired, listless. It has a going-through-the-motions quality. I don't care that it is slow and dreamy. I like slow and dreamy. What I don't like is slow and boring to the point of tears.  <br /> <br />Norah did a kind of grunge rock thing last summer, playing surprise gigs in New York clubs under the name \\"El Madmo,\\" which was much more fun than this. There's no El Madmo album, but you might still be able to find a couple of songs floating around the internets or on MySpace. Also, she was in a band called The Little Willies, and some of her work on that record is worth a listen. If you haven't heard it already, her album with the Peter Malick group, New York City, is decent as well. My point is that this album would be a waste of cash, because there is nothing memorable here. Nothing at all. But if you need a Norah Jones fix, you would be better served by buying one of those other albums I recommended.  <br /> <br />Norah is best suited to recording classic songs and putting her spin on them, as she did with wonderful results in the case of that Duke Ellington tune on the previous album, and Cold Cold Heart on her debut. It would be better if she took the Madeleine Peyroux route, by adding her own songs judiciously, as much quality output as she can compose. But with this album, it sounds like the well has, for the moment, run dry. Norah has finally become Snore-ah. ZZZzzzzzzzzzz. \\"Wake Me Up\\" indeed!
B000J103YI|5.0|If you've seen the movie, you already know the music is wonderful.  The CD is a must-have for anyone who loves motown or who enjoyed the movie.  Eddie Murphy is the biggest surprise, as he does a wonderful job in his portrayal of the character, both as an actor and singer.  I was so happy to know that he did all of his own singing...he's very impressive.  Beyonce and Jennifer (from American Idol) are also stand-outs.
0143034901|5.0|If there was a way for me to give this book more than 5 stars, I most certainly would!  I cannot say enough about the masterwork that this novel truly is.  There is so much to say and no better place to begin.  I should mention this is a translation of the original Spanish, but you would never know it was a translation since the text is immaculate.  I was given this book by a friend who has read the original in Spanish and I am told that it is even better in the original.  I cannot imagine how that is possible since this work is so amazing in the English.<br /><br />A story set in post Spanish Civil War, in a time period that recalls back to 1919 but most often takes place in the early 1940s.  The story centers around a young man (who first is introduced as a child) named Daniel that finds a rare book soon after his mother dies.  The book leads him and those closest to him on an adventure - more thrilling than you can imagine - that will leave you guessing the whole time.  This is a must-read!<br /><br />A story that touches the heart and sends shivers down the spine at the same time, this is a book to be reread.  From the very first page I was hooked and finished it in less than 24 hours because of its addicting powers.  You won't want to put it down.  Read this book today!  You will not regret it.
0553573411|5.0|Middle books of trilogies are supposed to be worse than either book one or three but that is so not true for this book. Political drama, adventure and court politics twirl in the Kingdom of Six Duchies where an ailing King is watching his sons combat one another for the throne, or so it seems. <br />The villain in the form of Regal is simply hateful and that is exactly the image of him that Hobb wants conveyed; there are times when he is a bit scary (because the reader would be reading from the perspective of Fitz, the hero) but that horror is so human that it bites into you for you to feel. It is the ugliness of a ruthless heart that unfolds itself and creates a solid impression on the mind of the reader. <br />Once again, credit goes to Hobb for a) Excellent characters which leave nothing to desire, b) a page-turning storyline and c) and end that will leave you gasping for the third book. For me, these characteristics of the book put Hobb in the same category as George RR Martin. <br />HIGHLY recommended.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I love Norah Jones, and the music on this disc is as incredible as ever. My big problem is the media onto which it is burned. The disc is copyright protected, so that not only will it not play on my computer, but I can not put the music on my MP3 player. It's outrageous that I am punished for doing the right thing. If I want to listen to this on my ipod (which is where 98% of the music I listen to comes from) I will have to either steal the music off of the internet, or pay for it again from Itunes. <br /> <br />Had I known I would had this problem, I would have bought it from itunes in the first place. The music is great, but do yourself a favor and download it. Don't pay these companies to offer you less content.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|I thought it was intrigueing. The characters were well written and acted. Completely enjoyable and nice ending. Thanks.  <br />A definate hit. Edgy
B000JMK6LM|3.0|Although I did find myself with tears in my eyes, thought this was going to be a much more powerful movie.  It did not show the events leading up, the full effect of the falling, or the drama of the people affected.  The time of the two Police Officers caught was not captured to the point of complete moving actions on the actors parts.  Did not understand how long they were barried.  Also the street shots were nowhere near as devasting as shown on TV during the real happening.
B000I5X81A|4.0|This is J.J. at his usual manner; slow and laidback.  I really felt good listening to this one, but I must admit that Clapton's  contributions made me somewhat drowsy(songs&vocals). This was my opinion after my first listening. Second time around,however, my ears were picking up Clapton's superb guitarwork. Here he proves that he's definetely his own master when it comes to provide the listener with delightfull & skillful guitar work.
0792838068|5.0|I have watched this movie probably a dozen times.  I found it to be one of the better movies out.  Nicolas Cage was truly unbelievable!!! One of the best preformances by him.  He is truly one of my favorite actors.  Will still watch it over and over again.  Love it!!!
B0001AP12G|4.0|This album is full of contradictions. He talks about hoes, money and head on the one hand and Jesus and social issues on the other. The album is however very entertaining and I can play it through for the most part, without too much skipping except when I got to tracks 13 to 17 - too many skits.  <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are: <br />4. All Falls Down - hot single; good message about people who are lost in school etc. Syleena Johnson is featured and she sounds great. <br />6. Spaceship - I love this song - it's about working someplace you hate. Consequence & GLC are featured and their rhymes are tight. <br />7. Jesus Walks - hot single with some good messages. <br />8. Never let me down - love it - the beat is sick - the singing is beautiful - JayZ's flow is outstanding on this. <br />9. Get em high featuring Common and Talib Kweli - good beat. Common and Talib Kweli's raps are both on point. <br />18. Two Words - nice beat; good raps by Mos Def and Freeway. The Harlem Boys Choir sounds good. <br />19. Through the Wire - hot single. <br />21. Last Call - long outro but it has a nice beat and tells the story of how he became a rapper. <br /> <br />Kanye has an annoying personality and so it shows on the worse tracks. The worse tracks are: <br />3. Graduation Day - silly, pointless interlude; <br />11. The new workout plan - this is a joke - it's about giving head as a workout; <br />13. Breathe in breathe out - another head giving song; <br />14. School Spirit Skit 1 - annoying interlude; <br />15. School Spirit - song about nothing; <br />16. School Spirit Skit 2 - annoying anti-education interlude; <br />17. Lil Jimmy Skit - another annoying anti-education interlude; <br /> <br />His anti-degree interludes are supremely annoying. Doesn't he realize that not everyone can end up in the arts, whether it's being a professional dancer, singer, producer, actor or artist?  If you have no artistic ability, then a college education in a marketable major is a good choice. Besides most people who aspire to be rappers/singers/producers never get discovered and never become famous. Hopefully kids listening to this CD won't take his rants seriously.
B000LC3ID8|1.0|The first Saw was a very scary movie.  This one was truly awful.  Very little to be afraid of.  Simply a quick follow up to #11 to keep them close togeather so people would not forget the first and second.  It was not even worth watching.
B000GGSMB2|5.0|This movie is excellent. Based on the subject matter(which is of a violent nature) it's certainly not for everyone, but I certainly believe it to be one of Al Pacinos finest performances and it is a classic as far as crime movies are concerned. I have waited a long time to purchase this DVD because I knew it would eventually be given the \\"royal\\" treatment, and I am happy to say that I was not dissappointed. The video transfer is very good and the audio upgrade is excellent. The DVD also has many extra features, although the counting of the F word feature was not necessary and actually detracts from the classic quality of this DVD. Otherwise I am very happy indeed.
B000JVRPUI|5.0|This is a great box set. It is well worth the price. The little Robby is so nice plus the mini lobby cards. A must have for the Forbidden Planet Fan
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This movie is great. I look forward to the sequel coming. The acting is supurb from all the big names, can't beleive that this movie did not bet any Oscar nods. Lots of action, twist and surprises. Jack plays his role well and is very effective as a mob boss. This is one to buy.<br /><br />P.Gossett, RN, TCBRN.
055380457X|5.0|A wonderful depiction of what Google is about. I found some discrepancy between portion of the information as it stated in the book and what Sergey Brin and Larry Page have stated. Overall a great read and gave a great background on what Google is all about.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|I have been a Beatle fan since I was [...]. I even have the White Album on white vinyl. I was excited about the reviews I read so I bought this CD. I was really looking forward to listening to some wonderful Beatles music again.     I was so disappointed I gave the CD away.  It is a amateur job of mixing multiple sound tracks together.    The songs that were chosen for this CD are already very well mixed masterpieces: i.e. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!/I Want You/Helter Skelter/Strawberry Fields.  So 90% of the work was already done before George Martin's son Giles started thumbing at the controls.   It would have been nice to see an array of Beatles songs that were not so commercial or heavily mixed weaved between these songs.    Now that would show real mixing skill.     Its a good thing that George Martin is almost deaf. I don't think he would have been too happy if he really heard what his son did.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I never, ever, fall for the most commercial song on a CD. I generally go for one of the hidden gems, the one that doesn't shine in the public domain of TV appearances and videos. This is not the case with this CD. From the moment I first heard it, I couldn't get \\"Put Your Records On\\" out of my head. To this day, I don't know why; the lyrical strings in many of the other songs are far more to my liking, but somehow the funny lightness of this song sticks to me, and I often find myself humming it during the day....<br /><br />\\"Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song<br /><br />You go ahead, let your hair down<br /><br />Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,<br /><br />Just go ahead, let your hair down.<br /><br />You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.\\"<br /><br />THE BEST OF THE REST<br /><br />\\"Like a Star\\" -- Lyrical, languid, lovely<br /><br />\\"Till It Happens To You\\" -- A quintessential breakup song<br /><br />\\"Call Me When You Get This\\" -- playful and sexy, a message to a lover:<br /><br />\\"Baby, if you're still awake,<br /><br />Call me when you get this.<br /><br />I've got all this poetry now, I didn't know then.<br /><br />I kept inside. Guess I had never seen anything beautiful<br /><br />Till I first saw you asleep at night.\\"<br /><br />\\"Trouble Sleeping\\" -- a bluesy classic; the horns on this song are memorable<br /><br />A couple of songs carry out the theme, but I'm less fond of them: \\"Breathless\\" , \\"Enchantment\\" and \\"Choux Pastry Heart\\". The material at the end of the CD is less comprehensive and \\"listenable\\" than the first 2/3.<br /><br />All in all, Bailey Rae demonstrates that everything old is new again - but she deserves to be compared only to herself and not some of the unique ladies that came before her. I hope that this early success is followed by continued success as an artist and songwriter.<br /><br />If you haven't heard this CD, it is highly recommended!
0930289234|5.0|I started reading comic books not so long ago. Since then i tried to get all the information possible about what to read, what's good, what's a milestone, etc.<br /><br />Everytime, Watchmen was mentioned.<br /><br />After reading it, i understand why.<br /><br />Watchmen is a fantastic graphic novell. The depth of the issues that the book talks about is inmense.<br /><br />If you like comic books. If you don't like comic books. Get Watchmen.
0618680004|1.0|Here we have a science guy explaining why he's smarter than everyone else in the whole world.  Oh, boy: just what we need.  For example, in one section Dawkins rolls out the old arguments about evolution and serves them up with a breathtaking condescension and arrogance.  The whole sad effort leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Readers would be much better served with Carl Sagan's beautifully written, \\"The Demon-Haunted World.\\"  Sagan makes many of the same points in favor of reason and science, but does it elegantly and with a kind spirit. <br />
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Among all the comic book movies available, this is the most mature, thought provoking, and life altering movie I have appreciated. Although it has its moments of violence and the graphics of bloody fights, its moral lessons are dominant and plow through all its action. It is worth the time of any adult and mature youth and I suspect they will leave it better than they started or at least a desire to be better.
B00008VGK0|5.0|I bought this single years after its release, but I wanted to hear this song again. I enjoyed it at the time, and I'm disappointed that many fans hate American Life. So what if she raps? I encourage fans and critics to listen to her lyrics, especially the message/her point, because its quite poignant. No, its not terribly poetic, but she can laugh at herself and America, while also praising her accomplishments and America's. <br /> <br />As for the melody itself, I never cared much for the original, as it went from techno and thumpy to melodic and romantic. I wanted to find a version that was consistently dancy, and I found what I wanted. The remixes haven't disappointed me. Its a given, they're long tracks, but not all of them. I especially enjoy Oakenfold's Remix. <br /> <br />So this single, if you can overlook the \\"cheesy\\" rap, then give it a try. I'm glad I bought this item. Go Madonna!!!
B000M341QE|1.0|The good:  Jack Nicholson/Martin Scorcese <br />The bad:   Everything else <br /> <br />Listen, don't waste your time seeing this movie.  The original \\"Infernal Affairs\\" is the masterpiece. This is another trumped up, \\"over-hollywooded\\" remake of a great Asian flick. Let's face it, DiCaprio trying to pull it off as a tough guy?  Yeah right. He's still a weenie.  And all of the extremely fake Boston accents made me want to pour cement in my ears. <br />I'm a movie fan. I watch movies for the entertainment, and comparing the original to this version is like comparing apples to dog s**t. <br />Remember, see Infernal Affairs, not this lame remake.
B00005J6RE|4.0|In 'The Ultimate Computer' mathematics genius Dr Daystrom (William Marshall) installs a new supercomputer, the M-5, aboard the Enterprise. It can run a starship better than humans, and it's to be tested in war games against four other federation ships. Daystrom is such a genius even Spock can only be of small help to him. McCoy says to Spock, &#34;This is what you'd like isn't it Spock?&#34;, &#34;you'd prefer a ship run by computer&#34;. Spock replies, &#34;I don't find it preferable&#34; in understatement. In fact, watching this episode for the fifth or so time . .  Spock and Kirk both have a deep conversation on the bridge about neither wanting to be replaced by machines. It isn't long after this the M-5 begins to malfunction. During the entire rest of the episode, there is no real evidence suggesting M-5 is purposefully malfunctioning but it is perhaps something to note.  When the war games begin, not only does the Enterprise react faster than the other ships, but the M-5 has shields and weapons set to maximum. The M-5 has malfunctioned. It's taken complete control of the Enterprise and doesn't see this as a game. The enterprise destroys one starship and heavily damages one or two of the others.  Dr Daystrom, - &#34;lecturing to fools, who don't even begin to understand my systems; lessor minds and competitors, building, on my work&#34; - a mad genius it turns out, whose own 'brain engrams' have been used in the creation of the computer, tries to talk the M-5 into disconnecting itself. The talk almost sounds as if it is a man in conversation with his child or even with himself, &#34;this unit must survive&#34;, M-5 insists.  Kirk asks M-5 to scan the starship Excelsior and Hood. The M-5 reports there are no life-signs aboard. 'You have murdered', Kirk proclaims, and both the M-5 and Dr Daystrom have a mini-breakdown giving the crew a chance to disconnect the faulty computer.

6305513414|5.0|'The Enemy Within', escapes when Kirk beams back to the Enterprise and two Kirks materialize, one after the other. One a good-Kirk, the other, an evil-Kirk.    Not to be confused with the episode where Janet Lester takes over Kirks mind by replacing it with her own (where was Shatners Emmy!), or the episode where Kirk is replaced by a mechanical Kirk as part of a plot where humans will be replaced by more perfect machines, or the episode where disembodies aliens, who have their minds stored in mechanical spheres, take over the minds of the crew as part of a mercy mission, or the episode where the crew transports to an alternate universe - where the federation is an 'empire' that rules by maintaining terror, and their counterparts from the evil universe, beam aboard the Enterprise (a fan favorite).    As The Enemy Within unfolds, the evil-Kirk becomes more aggressive, and the good-Kirk more indecisive. Each apparently needs the other. In the end they both go back thru the transporter and become one. Spock observing that ladies seem to like the evil-Kirk.

0780626494|4.0|Director Hugh Wilson (Police Academy) seems to be making a social statement here. The romance/comedy between Adam (Brandon Frasier) and Eve (Alicia Silverston) seems an incidental add-on. So much care and attention to detail went into creating the look and feel of 1960 America, the whole point of the movie must be to contrast that time with today. I don't buy the Webber family going down into their elaborate back yard shelter in 1960 then returning to the surface in 1999, as simply a vehicle for this romance comedy.<br /><br />The Webbers are a nice family if not perfect. Mr Webber dresses and acts a lot like Michael Douglas in the movie 'Falling Down'. During a period of tension during the cold war, while the Webber family is in the bomb shelter - a plane crashes in the families yard - they assume nuclear war. They educate and train their only child Adam underground as best they can inside the bomb shelter. Time passes. Mr Webber sends his son Adam, 35 now, above ground for the first time to get supplies for the family. Telling him, \\"be careful for mutants, son\\". When Adam gets up top, he mistakes half the people he meets for mutants (transsexuals, punk rockers, etc).<br /><br />Adam does meet Eve, falling in love with her. First, prudently asking if she's a mutant or not. The characters in this film are all likable - the Webber family, and Eve, playing a redemptive role here, and Eve's friend Troy - as is the movie itself likable.<br /><br />As is the case in many movies, the child here, Adam (who's only ever met 2 people in his entire life, his mom and dad), has a lesson for the adults. Adam saying, \\"Manners, are just a way for us to show other people we care about them\\". Later adding, \\"A 'gentleman' is someone who always tries to make sure people around him or her are as comfortable as possible\\". Eve asks about Adam, \\"Where do you think he got all that information\\"? Eve's friend replies, \\"From the oddest place - his parents.\\"
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine is the first movie in a long time where when I left the theater, my sides hurt from laughing. <br /> <br />Its a good wonderful movie. There is a misconception that this movie is one of those... Trailer films where a group of people go on a trip that changes them forever. <br /> <br />Well in a very small sense this is true. <br />But you will find the characters dont change that much really. <br />Each and every one of them is a little bit like all of us. Like parts of us. You will be taken aback by their strangeness, by their trueness, by the chain of events that just get stranger and more impossible to handle. And they handle them, not as perfect beings but as faulty humans. And every step is endearing, and more and more humorous. <br /> <br />When I first saw this movie, I saw it with my best friend who told me. <br />\\".. I cant tell you anything, Just trust me and bring kleenex and be ready to laugh..\\" <br /> <br />Im going to do you the same kindness. You'll be shocked,  you'll cry. But you will never laugh harder. Just trust me. And bring the kleenex.
B000063V8U|5.0|Season Six aired 'Chain of Command part 2' I'm just going to review the one episode.    In 'Chain of Command' Captain Picard, who knows Starfleet's battle plans for this sector of space, is captured by the Cardassians who are planning a surprise attack.    The entire episode consists of Picard being tortured by Cardassians. He's shown 4 lights in front of him and asked, \\"How many lights are there\\"? When Picard says \\"4\\" he's subjected to extreme pain. He's told, \\"you see 5 lights Captain, tell us how many you see\\". There are 4 lights, and Picard continues to tell him there are 4.    Other reviewers have said this is a scene taken from the story '1984' by George Orwell. Perhaps to highlight or explain the 'Orwellian' idea in the book, of being told one thing, while reality is something else. I did not notice this connection myself watching the episode, having never read '1984'.     Apparently, for the Cardassians, getting him to admit to something he knows is not true, even something as meaningless as this, is the first step in his brainwashing. They never ask Picard about battle plans, Starship numbers, or anything, but the number of lights. He's continuously subjected to extreme pain but even after extreme torture they can never get Picard to say he sees 5 lights. This is a terrible episode for the character of Picard, ranking up there with the one where Picard is assimilated by the Borg against his will.     After being rescued from the ordeal, Picard is counseled by Deanna Troi back about the Enterprise. He says, \\"You know, near the end. I could see five lights\\". Obviously with the torture he could 'see' 5 lights, something that wasn't even there (a powerful statement on it's own), but he continued to tell his captors he only say 4.    The episode is done in such a way that the end is really an awakening of sorts, and potentially a beginning. There was never any doubt in my (overconfident) mind that they intended to make some kind of statement at the end. I've only seen the episode once, but I knew that what I felt at the end was not a figment of my imagination or something subjective or personal.    When the show ends; when Picard says those last lines to Deanna Troi, about being alone on the prison planet, he's looking almost directly into the camera and not at Deanna, \\"Near the end. I could see five lights\\". When he says those last lines at the end.... we know he's talking to us.

B00021R7CG|4.0|A B-52 bomber crew is scrambled into action. After the plane takes off there is a nuclear strike on their base. The unthinkable has happened. They look back thru their bomb scope, and the base is gone. One of the crewman can't believe it. He thinks the base is still there. His wife and children are - were - down there. He can't believe it and they can't convince him the base is gone. He refuses to take his position on the plane. He's consumed with grief. Inconsolable he ejects himself out the bomber without a parachute.    Meanwhile the presidents helicopter has crashed and he's been injured. It's only been a limited nuclear war so far and he's determined to stop the war from escalating, the only problem is, he's no longer in control of the military.    The bomber continues on it's way to Russia, minus one crewman. The flight is almost exactly like the flight of the bomber in the movie 'Dr Strangelove' - \\"It's just one bomber Demitri\\", \\"I don't know why it's so hard to find it\\", \\"They're trained for that Demitri\\". Except in this flight, the female pilot convinces the crew to turn around and not drop their bombs on Russia. It turns out their inaction keeps the war from escalating and the president is able to gain control of the military once again.

B00005JPGO|4.0|It is 1990, and we are dropped into the strife of civil war and anarchy in Sierra Leone, West Africa. Many of the events depicted in this film were historically accurate. The RUF was a rebel group who viciously roamed the countryside killing civilians and government troops randomly, and they did amputate thousands of hands, and kidnap strong men to work in the diamond fields, and young boys to be conditioned into \\"child soldiers\\", drugged-out killing machines. Several factions competed for \\"conflict diamonds\\" that could be smuggled into neighboring Nigeria and sold in order to buy more weapons and bankroll more revolution.<br /><br />The film was directed by Edward Zwick, a mainstream mover and shaker who specializes in synchronizing real historical events with dramatic action and human nature -as many of his previous films are testament to. In BLOOD DIAMOND, there is a tremendous sense of place, of being there in Africa; much more so than say THE CONSTANT GARDENER (2005). Charles Leavitt wrote the screenplay and it hummed with authority, bathos, profanity, loyalty, and hue and cry for human rights. As a film, this DIAMOND would have stayed in the rough without his intelligent and powerful dialogue. The stunning cinematography was done by Eduardo Serra, and his images shifted from sun-kissed savannas to deeply forested steaming jungles, from ghetto squalor to serene country lanes -always ready to share a vista or come in close on a character's face.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio has made some kind of artistic breakthrough, some powerful transition in this last year. He emerges as a powerhouse. He has been on the \\"A\\" list for a decade, and finally he deserves it. His Danny Archer is sporting several pounds of muscle and an authentic-sounding African accent. His soldier of fortune who happens to be a smuggler is painted in tiny strokes of brilliance. He nailed this character. By the end of the film we care a lot about him. Russell Crowe was considered for the part, but I am glad DiCaprio got it.<br /><br />As good as Leo was in the movie, the film belongs to Djimon Housou as Solomon Vandy, a simple loving husband and Mende fisherman, his personal tragedy and strong sense of survival were beyond pivotal to the plot. If Archer was the intellect of the film, and the cunning, Vandy was its beating heart. Housou shows an impressive range as an actor, moving from parental tenderness to homicidal rage, from kidnapped slave to a free man, from forced civility to unencumbered visceral torrents of resistance. He is nominated for an Oscar, and he deserves it.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Jennifer Connelly as Maddy Bowen, the photo-journalist, was very effective; barely tapping her range as an actress, never the less, she shined in a part a lesser artist would have phoned in a performance for. Arnold Vosloo, always great, was cryptic and ruthless as Colonel Boetzee. Young Kargisdo Kuypers was a stand out as the son, Dia Vandy. Michael Sheen was quietly creepy and efficient as the businessman front for the Van De Kaap Corporation.<br /><br />Archer: Sometimes I wonder if God will forgive us for what we've done to each other. But then I look around and realize God left this place long ago.t, but I am glad DiCaprio got it.  <br /> <br />As good as Leo was in the movie, the film belongs to Djimon Housou as Solomon Vandy, a simple loving husband and Mende fisherman, his personal tragedy and strong sense of survival were beyond pivotal to the plot.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|Hey I love any movie that has Martin Scorsese's name stapled on it. THE DEPARTED is no exception, this movie definitley brings him back to his roots. Tons of F-bombs, violence, solid acting, and a solid story line. Ofcourse if you're not aware at this point that this movie is actually a remake of the original classic INfernal Affairs, then you need electric shock therapy. I've seen both movies and really, both movies are nothing alike other than several scenes ala the elevator shootout and the story. The rest is all Scorsese. THE DEPARTED is more of a stand alone. Infact it was mention that the movie is an 'adaption' not a remake. But heck. Who cares, the movie was amazing and that what counts, despit countless remakes there has been recently, here's one filmmaker who actually gives a s888.
037571457X|5.0|Readers of the graphic novel \\"Maus\\" will find themselves in familiar territory with volume I of Marjane Satrapi's autobiography. Here a tumultuous and violent period of recent political history is told with both horror and humor. And told from a child's point of view, it is deeply personalized, so that we see both the broad outline of a revolution and a war, and their impact on the lives of individual people. Meanwhile, there is the business of growing up, which takes place no matter what happens, and our young heroine demonstrates all the trials and tribulations of becoming a teenager in the midst of a world that is being turned upside down.<br /><br />While the book is a quick read - and suitable for readers young and old - there is much in it to ponder long afterward. For those who know little of what life has been like for Iranians living in the Islamic Republic, especially during the 1980s, the years of Khomeini and the war with Iraq, this book will begin to fill in some gaps in history, particularly as an understanding of Iran becomes increasingly important today.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|BABEL is a great movie. I loved it. Ofcourse opinions are for morons, everyones got one. But here's my two cents. The reason this movie has been getting slammed by the general audience is simply cause Crash stole it's thunder the year before. Dont get me wrong Crash was grea movie too. But both of these movie are nothing alike except for the story telling. Whereas Crash is political, this movie is more on personal family problems. Alejandro González Iñárritu is a great director. Most people aren't aware is of previous work: AMORES PERROS & 21 GRAMS.  BABEL is suppose to conclude his 'Death' Trilogy, and I have to say it may not be as heartbreaking as AMORES, but it still delivers. Just becareful cause this is a slow movie and won't play out to wide auidences. Hey same can be said for THE QUEEN, for some reason i dug this movie found the THE QUEEN a complete bore, besides the acting.

BUT, the real problem is that, if you have a widesreen TV, and you use your TV's \\"zoom\\" function to fill the screen, you're going to find that some of the menu buttons are off the bottom of the screen!

Since the DVD is so plain, there has to be a \\"Director's Cut\\" or \\"Special Edition\\" coming out in the near future.  Like an earlier reviewer put it, I am tired of buying a disc only to have a more extensive copy come out a little later.  I didn't see the movie in the theater, but I will be patient for a change and wait for the more extensive version that is sure to come.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|When Sean Connery (arguably the \\"best\\" Bond) quit in the 1960's - the franchise dug deep into the plot line of Ian Fleming's book \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" and produced a movie that many Bond aficionados recognize as one of the best - while introducing George Lazenby in the role. George - sadly - didn't last and the franchise rumbled through some dreadful Roger Moore years propped up by outrageous stunts and sharply pressed dinner jackets. Pierce Brosnan rescued Bond from the dark and foreboding Timothy Dalton - so many were dismayed when he decided to hang up his Walther PPK and leave the producers looking for someone new. <br /> <br />So on the day after Thanksgiving - the outlaws and I headed over to the local multiplex where 4 of the 20 screens were showing Daniel Craig's debut in Casino Royale. Glad we dropped by in the morning and bought our tickets early! If you haven't read the books -this was Bond's \\"first\\" mission for Ian Fleming and the producers have dropped a lot of the \\"givens\\" and started afresh with the franchise here too. Gone are Eon Productions, many of the \\"characters\\" who propped the previous movies and \\"in\\" are financial help from the Government of the Bahamas to place part of the movie there and some pretty overt product placement from Sony and Ford. Thank goodness it was a temporary aberration that had Bond drive a Ford rental, the Aston Martin (albeit Ford owned these days) gets more than a look-in with Bond winning a 1964 DB5 in a card game and later driving (and real world totaling) a DB9 later in the movie. But these little commercialization's in the movie don't detract from Daniel Craig's hard edged killer which harks back to Connery in Dr No when he kills in cold blood - because that is his job. <br /> <br />Without spoiling the ending - this movie faithfully follows the twists, turns and doubts of the original 1953 novel. Some scenes are lifted straight from it - notably when Le Chiffre tortures Bond. Of course the movie has been brought up to date in terms of locations, bad guys and the world 53 years after the book was written. But the gadgets are believable PDA's and computers that we all use in the real world - only a little better, the stunts are exceptionally good - and they are believable (well - just!) and the violence is not necessarily gratuitous - though people meet violent deaths when they get in the way. <br /> <br />Craig portrays Bond's dilemmas as real spy world, not necessarily black and white but varying shades of grey. Not just in his conscience but in who got disposed of along the way - and should they have been. M has her doubts - Bond has to remind himself that to survive he cannot afford to have doubts. The character forms and introduces himself at the very end of the movie in the very last line - \\"The name is Bond, James Bond\\". <br /> <br />Of course we really are now out of original Fleming novels so it will be interesting to see how we move on from here - but this Bond IS one of the best since the 1960's. Perhaps reusing them realistically - as here and in OHMSS will keep the franchise strong.

1401302378|5.0|This, for me, has been one of the most influential books I have read in the past decade.  I had read the article in WIRED magazine (I think it was in 2004) that introduced the concept -- and still have a copy.  Working through all of the implications covered in the book was a very mind-opening exercise. I am involved with a set of young, very talented musicians, and I have given several of them a copy of the book, once again, to open their eyes to the reality of their business (which they mostly do not know) and how the industry really works today. This book gets my highest recommendation, for anyone, but especially those involved in the arts.  I have also provided copies to my own health care business colleagues; the key ideas about how business really operates in the internet era are too important to ignore. <br />

Before seeing the film I wasn't quite sure what to expect and I almost didn't buy it; however in retrospect I'm glad that I decided to pick this up when I did. \\"Eraserhead\\" is bleak, horrifying, strange, sad, funny (in a weird way) and in this writers humble opinion one of the best films ever made. I would urge anyone who reads this review to watch \\"Eraserhead\\" at least once it's quite an experience, one that isn't soon forgotten.

The film is full of wonderful images of African cities and countryside. <br /> <br />This film is extremely well directed. This is basically a murder mystery with an international scale. The pieces of the mystery are pulled together carefully and in an intelligent manner that keeps the viewer quessing while also keeping the viewer informed so that they do not lose track of the action. The cuts from interiors to exteriors, serenity to action, vista to close-up, are all masterfully done. <br /> <br />The acting is superb, with Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes at their best. She plays the rich angry activist who over speaks and over commits. He is a more intellectual careful diplomat who is driven to bold brave action as he tries to discover who killed his wife and why.  <br /> <br />So if the photography, scenery, acting, and directing are all so excellent, why did I give it just 4 stars? I gave the film 4 stars primarily because of the shaky premise on which La Carre developed this plot. As we now know, TB is the major world killer of HIV infected persons. Medications to treat the treatment resistant strains of TB are crucial. In this film, a British pharmaceutical giant is testing a high powered TB medication on persons infected with HIV without consent and while some people are cured, many are dying from side effects of the powerful medication. This is so outlandish that it undermines the whole excellent film. Testing drugs without voluntary informed consent is no longer done and a pharmaceutical company that violated this rule would be in a heap of international trouble. The consequences of being caught are so great that no pharmaceutical company would ever do this. Secondly, in the film, those persons who are HIV positive and die of the side-effects of the drug are hidden in secret graves. Again, this is nonsense since licensure of medications requires extensive medical case records of those who did and did not receive the drugs.  If those persons who died from side effects are deleted from the data-base, the medication may then be deemed efficacious when in fact it is not. However, once licensed, and side effects emerge, the lawsuits would destroy the pharmaceutical company. There is really no incentive to hide side effects, distort the data, and then face a industry destroying crisis when the true effects of the medication are later discovered.  <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable suspenceful mystery showing a man propelled into brave action due to the incredible grief he feels for the loss of his wife and his desire to try to discover why she was killed. I just wish the central premise conducted by the bad guys was more realistic. <br />

I think my son would have been sleeping through the night much sooner. The author takes a very common sense approach to caring for babies and dealing with any problems that may arise due to inexperience. A great book for new (and experienced) mothers!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have loved the story of Jane Eyre since I first read the novel thirty years ago. Since that time, I have seen just about every version. It takes alot for me to be impressed and impressed I am because this version gave a new perspective on a story I know very well.  It's exciting and satisfying to view a familiar story from a different angle.    I would venture to guess that the writer and director considered Jean Rhys Wide Sargasso Sea as the backstory to this version.  This Rochester realizes the \\"mad\\" woman in the North Tower is as much a victim as he is and because of that he has a tenderness that is not always present in other adaptions. He is not as selfish as he is sometimes portrayed.  Although I do know from the book and other versions that Rochester's motives for bringing Blanch to Thornfield were to make Jane jealous, in this telling it almost seemed that he did it to put a buffer between them -- to protect Jane.  This Rochester is protective and caring as he constantly struggles between what he wants and what is right for Jane which demonstrates a strong true love.      Both Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens are well-cast.  Ruth Wilson brings life to Jane, making you see why Rochester -- a man who has travelled the world -- would fall in love with her.  Unlike many other versions, thier kinship is evident as we see there friendship grow.  Although some have \\"complained\\" that Toby Wilson is too handsome to fit Rochester, it should be remembered that by the standards of the early-to-mid 19th century, he would not be considered conventionally handsome. The ideal of the day was the blond-blue-eyed look of St. John.    This version may not follow the text exactly --- if you want that read the book--- but it is a wonderful story to lose yourself in for a few hours.

B000IMUYJM|5.0|I bought this around the time the remake was making rounds in theatres. I've always been interested in seeing it because of the praise it reaps, and I love seventies horror films as much as the next horror fan. Plus its a classic that not a whole lot of people know about except those who are fans of the genre. If I had to say one thing that kept me from viewing it, I've always been turned off by the fact that its a Bob Clark film. Clark of the Baby Genius and Karate Dog ilk is a director I avoid at all costs. I have to say after viewing this its a shame He doesn't have another go at the horror genre making another quiet and dark film like this. <br />Maybe its because I'm tired of all the modern horror films being Asian influenced (badly) or suplementing suspense with gore and brutaility but I was impressed greatly with this film. It was nice dark and sinister film with a good cast led by Olivia Hussey and John Saxon and a villain Clark smartly never reveals except in a few shadowy reveals during attacks. The killers phone calls were well done and sinister and a couple of P.O.V. shots (especially one where he goes ape and tears apart the attic where he's hiding) added to the character. Everything in this was classy and one of the main things I loved of the genre. If only one thing didn't work, it was little of that lame humor that characterizes Clarks comedies. Humor like horror is different for the viewer I say, but here it just didn't work for me. Other than that everytthing in the film was great and worth a view by all interested parties.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is being sold as a \\"CD/DVD\\" which it is, but it is the DVD which needs to be promoted and praised. The CD is a nice bonus to have to play in standard CD players like in your car.  The DVD really deserves some awards. The Grammys are a shallow and overly broad presentation of popular music and I am usually less than enthusiastic about the annual event. Still, I hope that this CD/DVD receives recognition there and in other venues throughout the year. The only thing left out by other reviewers who [like me] loved this production is more credit to Kenny Wayne's dad Ken Shepherd who as a co-producer supervised and contributed a lot to this magnificent documentation of the blues.
B0007TKNKG|4.0|When you think of Sylvester Stallone most of the times movies like Rocky and Rambo come to mind. But there were a few other gems he has done in the 1980's that should be noted as fun and interesting watches 20 years later.<br /><br />Over the Top is one of these films that you may have never heard about but should check out. Sylvester Stallone plays a truck driver named Lincoln Hawk who left his wife and son 10 years earlier due to the over baring and wealthy grandfather to his son Michael. Now with his wife that he hasn't been with in years dying, she has a request for father and son to reunite and get in some over due bonding time while they travel the road together. The grandfather Jason Cuttler, played by Robert Loggia is less then happy with the situation and wants his grandson returned to him at all costs.<br /><br />The story is more then just a son and father reunited situation. It also deals with an arm wrestling competition in Las Vegas that will act as the exciting climax to the movie. Hawk is a new comer to arm wrestling competitions but seems to hold his own in private battles at local truck stops. If he can win this tournament he can get a new truck and have money to hopefully start his own company. But most of all prove his worth to a son who he owes a lot of lost time and love to.<br /><br />While money wise, the movie was a dud in the box office, it has picked up a cult-following of sorts due to it's nostalgic and feel good story.  A lot of 1980's themes will be found in this movie. Most notably with the music soundtrack that blares at us in the opening and closing credits and throughout various driving moments on the road.  Sylvester Stallone really shines as well as a quiet, yet aggressive man who wants to be a father and drive a truck more then having any amount of money. The chemistry between Stallone and Loggia is interesting but far fetched at points. Loggia may come off as a little over the top and silly even in his schemes to keep the father and son apart so he can have him back.<br /><br />The only real downsides of the movie are the weak plot points. Some moments seemed rushed through like the role of the mother in this film and everyone rushing to Las Vegas for the films climax. Michael cries a lot and seems to be over acting at moments. And the way the writers tried to make his grandfather seem like a real selfish SOB but also give him a little heart was confusing if not out of place in the story. A few moments could have been done a little better but for the most part this is a very good feel good movie but also has a lot of action. Some of it again is forced like him using his truck to break into the Bel Aire home of said grandfather and pushing one of the henchmen through a door as it shatters to dust. A little 'over the top' ironicly.<br /><br />The best parts probably are the arm wrestling moments itself. The big underdog taking on really muscular and massive men that could even make some wrestlers shake in fear. Calm and steady Hawk taking them all on as they taunt him by drinking automobile oil from the can and giving him a bloody nose right before the match starts. The weird \\"Double Elimination\\" rules can make one wonder if that was put in for dramatic effects as they repeat that rule to us listeners at least 10 times so we get the point. Again seemed forced but the over all feel of the film is good fun and everything works out great for everyone involved and that's all one could expect from a movie of this time period.<br /><br />I definitely say give it a watch if you haven't seen it or have forgotten about it. Its a nice film that really showed a different side of Stallone and has a little something for everyone. I'm sure I'm not the only one who gets into the situation when his kid is yelling \\"Over the top dad!\\" as the tension mounts. A lost treasure from the past finally making its way to DVD. Not the best flim made but a lot of fun and a good trip down memory lane in one of those lostclassics from Stallone.
B00005JPGO|4.0|`Blood Diamond' is an excellent adventure.  Skillfully intersecting the lives of three key figures, we get more than a soap box lecture from the liberal left.  Hardly preachy, the movie has natural developments and dialogue that are organic to the story and its delivery.  Some of the heart-stopping violence and the tender timeouts are testaments to fine timing and storytelling.  Meaningful throughout, we witness how greed and violence scar the lives and landscape of developing Africa.  However, the film would be a worthy experience even if it didn't have a message.      Leonardo DiCaprio plays a jaundiced diamond bounty hunter, Danny Archer, mentored by the military prowess of a commanding colonel since his late teens.  Despite the fact that his longevity should earn him fringe benefits, he gets an assignment meant to patch up a recently botched effort.  To get what he wants, he crosses the path of refugee, Solomon Venge (Djimon Hounsou), who is trying to reunite his family after sectarian violence has split them apart.  Solomon has found and hidden a huge rough diamond in the middle of his forced labor at a rebel camp, which Archer could use as the payback acquisition.  In the middle is liberal reporter, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly), who wants to make a difference in the region more than win a Pulizer Prize.  Archer meets her and finds she can assist him with reuniting Solomon's family.   For her part, she needs the inside scoop of the black market diamond trade.  She knows about greedy agents, like Archer, are trading arms for diamonds to fund the rebels' side of the civil war, but she needs proof.  It's a complex, yet captivating trade.  In between these developments, we see Solomon's own son being indoctrinated and taught (among many) to fight with submachine guns for the rebel forces.     `Blood Diamond' may not always surprise, but it is filled with riveting adventure and harrowing battle scenes.  Urgent situations, anguishing details, and a connected plotconstruct a solid movie experience.   Pointedly, the film is meaningful.  The movie makes expert connections from the battles to the diamond trade to the jewelry store.  It also aligns the characters well.  In one emotional scene Archer and Bowen talk about his past, and we discover that he was made an orphan at an early age after civil war atrocities killed his parents.  Sometimes a few coincidences play too neatly into the hand of circumstance, but the exploitation and compelling chase scenes are presented genuinely enough.  DiCaprio's worthy Oscar nomination and fine supporting performances add to the cohesive story.  Even some of the cinematography is breathtaking enough to keep from taking the Third World for granted.  More than `Rambo' for liberals, `Blood Diamond' is a thoughtful and well-crafted movie experience with an important story to tell.

Excellent flick, interesting story, great effects = great time. A must own for your collection, at a great price.
0385484518|5.0|I think this book should be required reading for all highschool students.It is such a thoughtful insight into the human spirit and the human condition without being laden with the trappings of overwhelming sadness and concentration on death, in fact it is a celebration of life,  by Morrie himself, the dying character, which is so uplifting. It is beautifuly written by Mitch Albom, whom I had only known as a radio guy and that too, lends itself to the depth of the book. it goes deep enough with out leaving the reader left with a feeling of loss,but rather of having gained something very important in the book's final pages..

John Grays insite into how men and women think is amazing.  <br />I would say he hit's the nail on the head with everythign he says. Best of all, it makes you think and want to take action. Once you understand what the opposit sex needs, it's easier to give them what they need. Great CD's. <br />The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because John Grays reading of the story. I wanted to hear more excitement & feeling in his voice. I thought it was a bit to monotone. Really, this is a 5 star CD. Highly recommended.

B000002J0N|5.0|Back when \\"CSN\\" was originally released in June of 1977, it was something of a long-awaited reunion.  Crosby, Stills & Nash's debut LP came out in 1969, and they added Neil Young to the mix for 1970's \\"Deja Vu\\" and 1971's double live album \\"4 Way Street\\", but neither CSN or CSNY were able to get it together for another album until here.<br /><br />Of course, the guys were hardly idle in the meantime.  CSNY did tour in 1974.  Stephen Stills seems to have barely slept, making brilliant music as a solo artist in addition to putting together the band Manassas for live concerts and two albums; plus, he teamed up with Neil for the 1976 Stills-Young album \\"Long May You Run\\". David Crosby & Graham Nash continued to record and tour together, making fantastic music as a duo.<br /><br />So, although \\"CSN\\" was only the second bonafide Crosby, Stills & Nash album up to this point, there was no doubt at all of the brilliance of each individual member.  And this album, deservedly a huge hit, just proves it even further.<br /><br />The album opener \\"Shadow Captain\\" has a suitably epic feel with spellbinding harmonies.  \\"Anything At All\\" has Crosby's characteristic dreamy resignation to it, and in typical Crosby fashion, it really gets under your skin and moves you.  The supremely tender \\"In My Dreams\\" is wonderful, with a brilliantly-realized punchy coda that Crosby claims was \\"a gift from Graham\\".<br /><br />Speaking of Graham, he wrote the album's big hit with the short-and-sweet \\"Just A Song Before I Go\\" (which does feature some laughably aimless soloing from Stephen, as if he picked up the electric and did it all in one take having never heard the song before).  Graham also offers the very pretty and yearning \\"Carried Away\\"; the eerily reflective \\"Cold Rain\\"; and a brilliant epic of his own with \\"Cathedral\\", a cautionary tale about the perils of organized religion.<br /><br />Stills is consistently at his best here, which is saying a lot.  \\"See The Changes\\" had been previously recorded in a CSNY version which would later appear on the CSN box set, but the version here is easily superior and more fully-realized.  \\"Fair Game\\" is a deviously laidback Latin-flavored folk-rocker with lyrics that are a real riot, and Stephen rips out a hot acoustic solo toward the end.  \\"Dark Star\\" is a tour-de-force, grooving along infectiously with a catchy opening riff, jazzy chord changes and electric piano work, more superb lyrics and vocal harmonies, and another great acoustic guitar solo from Stills.  The orchestrated rocker \\"I Give You Give Blind\\", with its anthemic pleading choruses, brings the album to a rousing, soul-stirring conclusion.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but really, the greatness of this album speaks for itself.  Each member is demonstrated at their peak on this beautiful, must-have masterpiece.ld later appear on the CSN box set, but the version here is easily superior and more fully-realized.  \\"Fair Game\\" is a deviously laidback Latin-flavored folk-rocker with lyrics that are a real riot, and Stephen rips out a hot acoustic solo toward the end.  \\"Dark Star\\" is a tour-de-force, grooving along infectiously with a catchy opening riff, jazzy chord changes and electric piano work, more superb lyrics and vocal harmonies, and another great acoustic guitar solo from Stills.

0743457900|5.0|Le Carre has this reputation for complexity that can be off-putting, but I found this novel to be an approachable, exciting, and hard-to-put-down story. It boils down to a variation on the detective novel, but instead of a \\"who done it\\" it's a \\"who is it\\" mystery. We follow the primary investigator as he tracks down leads and puts 2 and 2 together until he gets his man. I was up way too late a few nights in a row, reading until I was too tired to keep my eyes open.  Simply put, if you enjoy both espionage \\"genre fiction\\" and literature as well, then Le Carre is for you. As for complexity, TTSS is more complex than novels by Tom Clancy or Ian Fleming to be sure, but it's not Tolstoy or Dostoevsky either.
0440418569|2.0|I enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy. However, this third book needs some serious time in the Intensive Book Surgery Unit before it should have even been published. Frankly, this manuscript should have been kicked back from the editor to the author and refused. I realize that's a pretty heavy thing to say, but it's true. Something went badly wrong here. <br /> <br />The author did not do his job in bringing his protagonists to closure; having two kids fall in love, then decide to live apart for the rest of their lives is a complete crock. Puhleaze. I grew to rather like the aeronaut Texan and the explorer, and they're killed to little point. Puhleaze. Iorek the Bear is darn cool, and he barely (sorry) makes an appearance in book 3. Puhleaze. And, by the way, who is Mary, introduced so late in the trilogy, as an underfunded Dark Matter physicist (who just happens to be ... an ex-nun ... now, just wait a minute here, is that heavy handed or what?)... and Dark Matter would be *under* funded? Puhleaze. (Although these days, she'd be working on Global Warming.) And Mrs. Coulter, in a lifetime full of being evil, suddenly has a turn of heart (yes, just like The Grinch), and, in her new fullsome of goodness, helps kill an angel. Huh? What? Say that again? <br /> <br />   I was thrilled (not) at Pullman's description of an endless, boring ... [come to think of it, very much like reading Volume III of this trilogy] ... somewhat-Purgatory-Without-Dante's-Skill that apparently is his vision of death. Everyone stands around being ... boring. Gosh, how exciting, what a vision, et cetera. It's duller than the endless views of the Enterprise in Star Trek I. It's more boring than the endless endless views of the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey. When the dead people standing around there are given the chance to decompose, they go for the gusto. As to why any of this should be in a book, I can only offer my puzzlement.  <br /> <br />    Jerry Pournelle once gave me some terrific advice. \\"Never give a reader a chance to put down one of your books, because if you do, they will, and they'll never pick it up again.\\". I zoomed non-stop through the first two books of this trilogy. The last book took me a week plus and I was extremely annoyed with it.  <br /> <br />I was amused that Philip Pullman, in his Afterword, gives credit to stealing his ideas (those are his words) from Paradise Lost (John Milton). Frankly, I wish he had stolen more, this book would have been better. His utter hatred of The Church shines through this book. He has sort of an Idiot's Guide to Quantum Mechanics but isn't up on it. <br /> <br />   This mess needs to be storyboarded, and everything that does not PROMOTE THE STORY needs to be chucked out. And that's about half of this book. Whoever edited this book badly needs to be chewed out. I suspect, though, that it boiled down to \\"not enough time to fix\\" in the publishing schedule; Del Rey is not noted for publishing messes like this. <br />
B00003CXFV|4.0|Great movie! Nicely told with great acting! I love the fact that Ms. Brockovich made this case happen! She was the underdog here when no one wanted to employ her because she didn't have the right look or the job experience. But Brockovich made things work to her advantage. The same can be said of the case in this movie which Brockovich helped her employers research and win!

I liked that there was an inward focus--since we often self sabotage and are not sure why.  But I was not so impressed by the constant references to his many classes and retreats.  I often found myself wondering if the book was written solely to get people hooked into taking one expensive class after another.  I think the book's credibility would have been much stronger without Harv's constant sales pitches.

B000E8NQUE|4.0|This is a good cd to listen too by sitting back, closing your eyes and perhaps day-dream as suggested in the cd title. <br />Even though I am not familiar with any of the cd's tracks I was impressed with the music. The surround sound was excellent, with clear and crisp instruments and voices well distributed in varying quantities at different times between the front, back and side speakers. (I have setup my audio system as a 9.1). <br /> <br />The only negative is that the audio is only 5.0, not 5.1. Also, only the first 13 out of 22 tracks use the 5.0 surround sound. <br /> <br />I would recommend this SACD to non-Moody Blues fanatics.

B000KQGP2G|5.0|Pain of Salvation are back with what appears to be the most controversial album of their careers, Scarsick.  What makes Scarsick a different album?  Texture and sound--PoS have removed everything that's pretty and accented the ugly.  Lyrically speaking the album is a commentary on the United States--a cynical view.  Simulating the voice of the culture (\\"\\"Spitfall\\"\\") while also embracing their rich Mike Patton influence with the Mr. Bungle infused \\"\\"Disco Queen,\\"\\" PoS continue to evolve in their sound.  While featuring Daniel at his most socially conscious it also features the most rapping he's done on any album too date. Less harmonies, less complication and more anger then any other disc, Scarsick represents a growing reaction to the projection that Americans have gone out of their way to create for the world; we are spoiled and shut in living within ourselves.  Though would it be unfair to say that most people in the world do the same?  <br /> <br /> Outside of Mr. Bungle, PoS have, again, buried their influences in Daniel's unique capabilities.  While maintaining the signature PoS quirkiness, they have expanded their sound by incorporating simpler musical sections and rhythms that remind me of KoRn (\\"\\"Idiocracy,\\"\\" \\"\\"Flame to the Moth\\"\\").  Their in, though, lives the power of the album.  Stripped down and naked, blunt and efficient--Daniel has eschewed metaphor and replaced it with what he feels Americans should understand; awkward overstated honesty.  This honesty is only awkward though because it's unlike him.  The lyrics could be considered the trite musings on the sociopolitical state we find ourselves, but the past must be taken into account when judging the future, so we know the elementary level of his lyrics form a purposeful relationship with an album that might represent the least musically progressive, but most divisive, in the PoS catalogue.  Saying the album is progressive may throw listeners off in many respects. The album is not chock full of time changes and odd meter; it's progressive in the truest sense of the word, as Pain of Salvation always has been.   <br /> <br /> From the aggressive opener \\"\\"Scarsick\\"\\" to the Zepplinesque closer \\"\\"Enter Rain\\"\\" the band show all of it's influences without ever losing their originality.  Forget the pretty, forget the time changes, embrace the complicated dressed as simplicity in the form of Scarsick! <br />
0743270754|5.0|\\"Team Of Rivals\\" is a great contribution to our understanding of Lincoln and his presidency.  It can be hard to understand and appreciate Lincoln as he was because we forget that he was not elected by acclamation.  In order to become president he had to get the nomination of the Republican Party and receive more votes than his opponent in the general election.  To do so required that he participate in that often ugly pastime called politics.  Today we ask: \\"Who could vote against Lincoln?\\"  The answer is that in 1860, and, to a lesser extent in 1864, many people did just that. <br /> <br />The story of Lincoln as a masterful politician has never been told as Doris Kearns Goodwin tells it in \\"Team of Rivals.\\"  The tale is summed up by the remarkable fact that Lincoln placed his bitterest rivals in the most important positions in his cabinet simply because he believed that they had abilities needed to preserve the Union.  How Lincoln \\"herded cats\\" for four years to take advantage of these men and their talents helps us to put all of American political history in perspective. <br />
0307276902|5.0|Who cares if every little or big detail is true?  This is a great book.  A great story.  Great writting.  It might not be completely true but it comes from the source of truth and in that way I feel that it speaks the language of truth.  It rings true and it inspires.  James Frey-- thank you for writting this book, it has opened my mind in good ways.

1400082773|5.0|I was fascinated by this unusual story and carried along by the eloquence and insightfulness of the author.  My only complaint about the book is that it was frustrating to read about various people and to have no pictures to use as roadmarks.  The people in Obama's life are very interesting characters on their own and need more identification in the reader's mind.  Even so, this made a great reference work for the subsequent book, Audacity of Hope, which was the best book I've read in the past year. What an interesting life!

0670034711|1.0|Desperate for something good to read after finishing 'Notes on a Scandal' (one of the best books I've read in a long time, possibly ever), I picked up this pile of twaddle in the local book store.  I should have realized that the author would have about as much insight into depression, loneliness and feelings of alienation as a clam.  You can't feel sorry for the author because she seems to have brought on her malaise almost entirely on herself.. Oh, that's OK honey, you take the house and the apartment that I paid for because I feel \\"guilty\\" about leaving you... Please! Is she deliberately trying to set the Women's Lib movement back 100 years??  This attitude is all very touchy feely, 'Yes, I'll take all the guilt and blame for something that isn't entirely my fault because society dictates that I'm supposed to be the submissive gender', but hardly a practical way to live in the REAL WORLD, which the author clearly has no clue about doing. She really has no reason to be depressed given the luck at being able to afford to travel to places most people dream about visiting once in their life, and all expenses paid! Not surprisingly, she really doesn't sound very depressed, we all cried and felt anxious after 9/11..Most women have battled with loneliness and depression, but most are forced to continue in their lives looking after families or children, or just struggling to keep a roof over their head.  I bet, if you gave most of these women an all expenses paid trip to Italy they would start to feel better, without the help of a nasty cocktail of antidepressents like she was taking (I counted four different kinds, yikes!).    In short, this book is not funny, or insightful, or challenging.  Mostly it's just a series of obvious to the point of being cliched observations about breaking up and traveling in a foreign country. I honestly looked for more depth but it simply wasn't there. Please go eat some more gelato, and please, don't write any \\"voyage of self discovery books\\" again. Well, do, if there is a market for this stuff, but I'm personally amazed that any self respecting modern female would find this book anything but insulting.
0142000655|3.0|With much regret I am reporting that I did not like this book.  I know I am an anomaly from all the other positive reviews this book has received.  I came to read this book upon the prompting of my mother and sister who both enjoyed the book immensely.   <br /> <br />  I stopped reading \\"East of Eden\\" the other day.  I just couldn't take the brutal nature of some of the characters.  I do not remember feeling so upset and disturbed when I read \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" \\"The Red Pony\\" or \\"the Pearl\\".  That was a long time ago so my memory has been dimmed by the years maybe it was in those books as well.   <br /> <br />   I wonder if the character Kathy/Kate was the summation of all the horrible women Steinbeck ever knew.  Reading page after page of the demented things she did was just too much for me to justify the read.   <br />
0321213351|5.0|Well done book, and a valuable next-step in learning about design patterns. The original GOF presents them in isolated and rather sterile format and manner, this book adds a much richer context and analysis in actually using them in application refactorings.

B000KCHZK6|4.0|this album has somewhat of a dark-ish mood to it, yet quite whimsical i'd say.  the  album artwork matches the feel of the music itself.  the tonalities of each track complement their lyrics quite well.  and the way she carries the melodies match the tone of the track.  i think much of the album showcases what was taught to me in jazz band in high school as \\"give & take\\" (i think thats what it was referred too :) where the melody/soloist and the music almost have a dialogue in that they speak to one another kind of overlapping each others' lines in the song.  of course, none of my opinions probably make any sense to anyone!  haha. <br /> <br />my favs are:  I'll Be Thinking About You, Broken, Not Too Late <br /> <br />to appreciate this album, you have to try and look at it as a \\"new\\" listener to norah jones because if you compare it to just \\"Come Way With Me\\", well i guess i would understand how some people could be disappointed.
0876852630|5.0|My two favorite Bukowski books are definitely a toss-up between \\"Factotum\\" and \\"Ham On Rye\\".  They both offer a lot to die-hard Bukowski fans and Bukowski beginners alike.  His writing is often a \\"love it or hate it\\" type of thing.   <br /> <br />If you are a hardcore Buk fan, then you have likely already read this.  If you are new to Bukowski, keep in mind, however, that his books are often very graphic and obscene.  If you don't offend easily, then this book is a must-read.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|<br />James Bond has finally been transformed to a character of relevance and substance for diverse audiences of this decade.  I revered James Bond as a thirteen-year-old boy, then I grew up and he didn't.  Casino Royal is a film that dares to break with the convention of this tired franchise and succeeds brilliantly with interesting characters that have depth, a plot that has enough twists, enough action and enough eye-candy to satisfy any action junkie.   <br /> <br />Until now, Ian Flemming's iconic male role model of the 1960's stayed stuck in the 1960's as if preserved in formaldehyde, a relic of the past, out-of-step with an audience now way more mature and sophisticated than Bond himself.  The Bond franchise continued to turn out a steady procession of formula films characterized by just enough plot to weave together a predictable array of gadgets, attractive women and suave martini-drinking actors.  Over the years, what used to pass as suave became corny, sexist and just plain dumb.  Voice-command cell phones and in-dash GPS navigation all made \\"Q\\" gadgets irrelevant.  Meanwhile, I was swept away by brilliant story-telling, acting and eye-candy of the spy-genra innovators like Mission Impossible and Bourne Identity.  Well, I can now say that Bond, James Bond, is back. <br /> <br />Daniel Craig is an unlikely but brilliant choice for Bond, recreating the lead in a unique and believable character all his own.  He's a commanding presence on screen the average person can still identify with, delivering a serious performance with remarkable depth like a sledge-hammer blow: totally focused, purposeful and intelligent.  Expect wit, not puns.  He's also built like a tank and not afraid to get his hands dirty during some very physical action scenes.  <br /> <br />Eva Green very competently plays the beautiful \\"Bond Girl\\" opposite Craig with great depth and intelligence.  She carries a significant weight of the plot and the inevitable love interest that evolves serves to reveal intimate vulnerabilities and great chemistry between the leading characters.  Mads Mikkelsen makes a competent (if somewhat camp) villain, and does provide a worthy opponent to Bond, as Judi Dench delivers a much more broad performance as not only Bond's boss but mentor.   <br /> <br />A great cast of other supporting characters are well played and contribute to intriguing plot developments.  Minor villains to major puppet-masters all converge with terrific timing to provide a great theater experience.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|With Babel director Alejando Gonzalez Iñárritu completes his trilogy begun with Amores Perros and 21 Grams, and demonstrates just how powerful movie-making can be in the hands of an artistic genius. Iñárritu connects four deeply human stories by the tragic and unintended consequences of a random act. In the desert mountains of Morocco, two little boys shoot at a tour bus while playing with a rifle that their father bought to shoot jackals that threatened their goats. In San Diego, Susan and Richard travel to Morocco to heal their marriage but encounter tragedy on a tour bus. In Mexico, the nanny and illegal immigrant Amelia attends her son's wedding but runs afoul of the law when she tries to re-enter the United States. In Tokyo, the deaf and mute teenager Chieko searches for love in all the wrong ways to overcome the fallout of her mother's suicide and her father's emotional distance. <br /> <br />Babel (the title comes from Genesis 11 in the Bible) is a cinematic metaphor for our post-modern, global age, ambitious in scope and layered with multiple themes--family, the collision of cultures, poverty, helplessness before state power and petty bureaucrats, human estrangement, misinformation and miscommunication, international terrorism, and fate. Every component of this film--sound track (including an unforgettable scene in a Tokyo disco when the pounding music goes silent in order to simulate Chieko's deafness), scenery, narrative, and cinematography--combine for an overwhelming effect. Give your heart and mind to this film and its characters, and you will leave the theater on mental, spiritual, and emotional overload. In Moroccan Arabic, Spanish, Japanese, English, sign language, written notes, cell phone video and text-message, and English sub-titles (so that in many scenes the viewer knows more than the characters who do not or cannot understand what is happening).

B00082IJ08|5.0|Living in South Korea, I was way behind the buzz when the Gorillaz released this second album.  I simply saw the title on my Amazon.com recommendations list.  I loved their self-titled debut so much that I immediately ordered \\"Demon Days.\\"  I never heard or read one word about the album.  I got the CD in the mail, listened to it, and loved it.  So, point number one: if you liked the first one, you'll like this one.<br /><br />What should the rest of you expect?  The cartoon side-project that is represented by this group (which is really less of a \\"group\\" and more the brain-child of Damon Alburn of Blur) is a heavily experimental affair.  Where the first record moved all over the map, toying with new mixes of old sounds, this record has a definite (almost narrative) flow.  It starts with \\"Last Living Souls\\" in bass-heavy darkness, the music rich and wide with a cavernous feel, a hint of up-swing to the playfully gloomy sound.<br /><br />\\"Kids With Guns,\\" \\"O Green World,\\" and \\"Dirty Harry,\\" in spite of their playground pop sounds, are all similarly creepy.  They play with lilting electronica and prodding rhythms, underlaying these things with an addictive, scabrous disonance.<br /><br />Then comes the appropriately mislabled \\"Feel Good Inc.,\\" the first single of the record, and with good reason.  Featuring unsettling back-laughter, penitent lyrics, and De La Soul's invigorating voice, this song courts the album's dark mood with a lighthearded step.<br /><br />That lightheartedness slinks away and hides in the next four tracks (with names like \\"All Alone\\" and \\"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead,\\" that's to be expected).  A tapestry of needfulness, lamentation, frustration, and yen-like confusion is woven in songs that are alternately soft and wirey, tender and knuckled.  The dreariness is toppped off in \\"All Alone,\\" which also includes a chorale of hope, leading into the next stellar track, DARE.<br /><br />Easily the centerpiece of this album, DARE is a futuristic world-hopper, an incredibly fun, amazingly crafted soul-massage.  Deep driving buzzes mixed expertly with high, stratospheric hums make for a song that is both playful and dreary, a combination that works, and works well.<br /><br />Dennis Hopper's spoken-word \\"Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head\\" isn't so notable, although it does segue (thematically and musically) into the album's final key notes of redemption.  Church choir joy fills up \\"Don't Get Lost In Heaven,\\" a song that is like the equivalent of a warm, amber dawn after a cool, ghost-plagued night.  The next song, \\"Demon Days,\\" is hardly another song at all, but the second half of the album's send-off into a brighter and happier world.<br /><br />An inspired musical journey through twilight into day (or, if you prefer, simply a collection of fun, intelligent music), \\"Demon Days\\" is a world you'll enjoy visiting.c world-hopper, an incredibly fun, amazingly crafted soul-massage.

0060730552|5.0|I loved Into Thin Air, but liked Touching the Void even better.  If it weren't so well documented, this story of survival would be hard to believe.  If you plan on doing both, see the movie first.  I read the book first and it made the movie just okay, while those with me who saw the film without reading the book were mesmerized.  The book, as is usually the case, is just plain better, and I think would still be great after seeing the film.<br /><br />Simpson, being a climber first and author second, uses a lot of jargon specific to climbing that I didn't understand, but it made me look some of it up and learn more about the sport, which was kind of cool.  I felt like I was right there with him during his unreal descent, sharing the loneliness, cold, and delirium.  I have even gotten the same annoying song stuck in my head that drove him crazy during much of his ordeal.<br /><br />If you are a fan of survival non-fiction, you have probably already read Touching the Void.  If you are considering trying this genre, you couldn't possibly find a better choice; if you don't like this book, I can pretty much guarantee you are not going like any others in this category.
B00006G9QN|3.0|When \\"The Day After Roswell\\" came out in 1997, I was working in a bookstore in Albuquerque. We got the book's author, Philip Corso, for a signing. <br /> <br />Our store had a good reputation for events around \\"High Strange\\" subjects, partly due to my efforts. Publishers knew we were worth putting on the schedule. Besides, UFO books in general make for good trade - host a novelist or a 'serious' book and you might get less than a dozen people, feature a UFO author and you could count on at least 100. <br /> <br />And it was well over 100 who turned out for Philip Corso that night. It was a great draw, even besides the local interest of Roswell: an ex-military man who had been \\"deep in\\", telling all... <br /> <br />Mr. Corso made an impressive speaker. His grasp of names and dates was so immediate that it actually made me envious; he never seemed to falter in his recall. He was able to reel off locations, offices, names, ranks... <br /> <br />He covered the basic elements from the book: that he had been called upon to assist in reverse-engineering and disseminating technologies garnered from alien craft, and that he had seen what seemed to be a small humanoid body packed in blue gel. He was careful to state that such was his only exposure to \\"the Roswell question\\", and that he had not himself seen any alien spacecraft <br /> <br />Then he took questions from the audience, and here it was that things started to get fuzzy around the edges. Just as does the book, he started to vary from the things he said he had personally witnessed, and included material from other sources. <br /> <br />At one point he mentioned that someone elsewhere in the government had told him that they had received some sort of strong signals from space, from a direction which Mr. Corso recalled and could provide. And he said, \\"Someone at one of these things [meaning a previous signing event] told me that in that direction is Zeta Reticuli.\\" <br /> <br />(I groaned inwardly when I heard him say this. Zeta Reticuli was a particular favorite for the UFO enthusiasts at the time, as a home for certain alien visitors. And I just knew that, were I to interview the crowd the next day, a goodly number of them would remember that Mr. Corso had told them that the signal came from Zeta Reticuli. Thus do folktales grow.) <br /> <br />He answered a variety of questions, then we moved on to the signing of the books. As the host for the signing, it was my job to make sure things kept moving smoothly, and I was at Mr. Corso's elbow as I opened books so he could sign them. Thus I was privy to all of his conversations with people. <br /> <br />Most of the discussions were the usual things -- \\"usual\\" for a UFO book signing being a mix of sincere inquiry and intense conspiratorial viewpoint. But it was right at the end that things got really interesting. <br /> <br />A young boy came up with his mother; they had been waiting patiently and the boy had a drawing he wanted to show Mr. Corso. The boy was interested in engineering, as was Mr. Corso's son (or was it grandson? - I cannot recall for sure) and the author warmed to the boy and spent more time with him than he had with anyone else. <br /> <br />Mr. Corso praised the boy's drawing and told him to continue in his studies and become an engineer and maybe someday he would go into space. Then they talked about spacecraft and what they might be made of, and Mr. Corso suddenly said, \\"And even in the hot sun, they are cool to the touch, you know.\\" <br /> <br />The boy asked what, and Mr. Corso said, \\"Alien spacecraft.\\" My ears pricked up at this, since I had not long before heard him say very clearly to a large group of people that he had never himself seen an alien spacecraft, and now he was telling this young boy that he had touched one. <br /> <br />Mr. Corso proceeded to make a drawing for the boy, a representation of a classic flying saucer stuck into the ground at a 40-degree angle. He said that he had gone up to it and put his hand on it and \\"even in the hot desert sun it was cool to the touch\\". <br /> <br />The boy thanked him and took the drawing and left; the event was over. And I was left to mull over what I had heard. <br /> <br />Mr. Corso seemed to be what so many people in UFOlogy had been awaiting: an inside source, finally telling his tale. (Though even in the book he is very vague why he finally decided to break his security oath.) His presentation made him seem sharp and sure of his recall of names, titles, and places. But his willingness to be agreeable to suppositions put to him by the audience made me uneasy. And hearing him contradict a major part of his testimony in less than an hour made me place all of his testimony in question. <br /> <br />I had to conclude that Mr. Corso was a very nice old gentleman with some great stories. His grandkids growing tired of his stories, he went looking for a new audience and found a willing and eager one in the UFO community. And he himself was willing to support suppositions which were presented to him, as a way to please his new audience. <br /> <br />Mr. Corso's death soon after the release of the book brought, if not joy, great satisfaction to the conspiratorialists who could now claim that he was \\"silenced because he told the truth\\". But the truth I personally heard him present changed markedly in only a short time, and I carry away the conviction that Mr. Corso's stories are just that - stories - and do not constitute evidence.

0618680004|1.0|Why? This most central of theological questions can also be applied to this book and its author. <br /> <br />Richard Dawkins is without doubt an honest atheist. Fine. Dawkins wants to justify and popularize his worldview. Also fine. Dawkins attacks any type of religious or spiritual belief, credits such with the worst aspects of culture and attacks noted religious, ie Mother Teresa, as misguided hypocrites. He even believes and argues that religion should be removed from modern society. Why? <br /> <br />If Dawkins approached his science the way that he approaches the subject of religion, he never would have graduated from high school. His treatment of the subject is completely superficial and tainted by his hatred. He uses adolescent examples of school yard debates on several occasions. It is well suited to his style. <br /> <br />Dawkins must have been wounded at sometime in his life by either religion or some type of religious person. The pain of rejection is obvious like a schoolboy who has be spurned by his high school sweetheart; he exults in every slam and slander. <br /> <br />
B00005JP9V|5.0|I've seen this movie twice and I have to say I caught more of the subtleties this time, knowing what was going to happen. The movie is so well done with documentary style camera work, long takes, and superb special effects that blend into the film. I'm still trying to figure out how they did some of the things in the film, although some are easier to figure out, but that's not the point. <br /> <br />Clive Owen has to be the best actor I've seen in a long time. His face a maze of emotion playing everything from a pacifist to someone who finally finds a cause. Playing grief and joy so realisticially, it's stunning! The rest of the cast blends perfectly with Michael Caine having my other favorite role. <br /> <br />There is an overall politcal message to the film which is that when a crisis develops of this scale (manmade or natural disaster) governments - legitimate, democratic ones - usually respond to the fear that the situations create more than anything else and that makes them respond harsh and wrong. Any other political discussion about the film will give things away, and I don't want to do that know, do I? :) <br /> <br />It's easily one of the best films I've seen in a very long time.

6303224644|4.0|Meet Me in St. Louis takes a war-torn America back to a simpler time, a time when telephones were new and everyone was talking about the World's Fair. The Smith family is very close, and although each of them have their problems, they share their lives with each other. Esther (Judy Garland) has a crush on \\"The Boy Next Door,\\" and sings a beautiful song about him. Rose (Lucille Bremer) hopes to be proposed to, even if it is over the telephone. Tootie (Margaret O'Brien) has a fascination with death and a wants to be included with the older kids. Everyone's lives are changed, however, when they hear that their father is going to move everyone to New York for his job.<br /><br />There are plenty of great songs here, and although many of them sound like show-tunes, they enhance the film quite well. Aside from \\"The Boy Next Door,\\" we have the famous \\"Trolley Song,\\" as well as the now-classic \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and a fun number called \\"Under the Bamboo Tree.\\" Of course, the main title song \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\" is run throughout the film.<br /><br />You might think the story is rather silly and unrealistic, but it is actually based on the memoirs of the woman that Tootie's character is based on. One can learn all about it and other behind the scenes stories like about the romance that developed between Garland and her director Vincente Minelli in the documentary also included on this VHS.

The very word \\"opera\\" in the title is an insult to the good names of Puccini and Verdi.<br /><br />In my youth, I had marginally enjoyed Jesus Christ Superstar, and thought that Evita was fine theatre.  But I hated Sunset Boulevard, and have no thought of ever seeing that ubiquitous tourist-trap, Cats.  After 38 years of attending Broadway, and seeing dozens of musicals, I have come to loathe the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, and the score and story of the Phantom of the Opera above all.  If you are still reading, let me explain why.<br /><br />I believe that Mr. Webber epitomizes exactly what is wrong with modern Broadway musicals.  His music never advances beyond trite, overly sentimental commercial fluff.  The singsong structure of his formulaic melodies and their contrived, adolescent lyrics are apt to get stuck in your head for days, while almost never managing to advance the storyline or explain the character's motivations.  At best, his style is derivative; the melody line for Music of the Night sounds suspiciously to me like portions of Puccini's La Fanciulla del West, and in spots, I hear poor imitations of La Boheme.  At his worst, I get the feeling that he writes with one eye on his checkbook and both ears tuned to the latest trends in top-forty radio.  When I listen to anything Webber, my mind's ear automatically hears Celine Dion and Britney Spears, stripped of even the bare modicum of taste that their least commercial endeavors have to offer.  Not only are his lyricist's poorly structured songs devoid of wit and ingenuity, they frequently leave the action dead in the water.  Worst of all, they pander to the mentality of a nation reared on reality TV, empty pop tunes and American Idols.<br /><br />I saw Phantom on Broadway.  When the final curtain came down and the applause subsided, I realized with great sadness that today's Broadway audience seems content with smoke, mirrors, and special effects.  I kept marveling that so much applause could be wasted on a show built around a chandelier and bad pop songs.  The lyrics often make no sense at all, when they manage every so often to rhyme, they grab hold like there's no tomorrow, refusing to let go.  Sondheim it's not; in fact, for my money, they've got a way to go to overtake Jerry Herman, or even the long-forgotten composers of Happy Hunting.<br /><br />Then there are the plot holes; for lack of unlimited space, let's cover just a few.  Christine apparently has lived in the opera house since being orphaned.  I didn't know anyone had ever lived in an opera house, but why not?  If the story is to be taken seriously, one has to wonder how Christine's father came to repose in an opulent crypt, while she was forced to mature in the squalor of a dressing room, which is about all I ever really learned about her.  Anyway, Christine believes that the Phantom is an Angel of Music, despite his demonic, cryptic notes bearing sinister demands, and resorting to murderous acts of vandalism when he doesn't get his way, like a petulant child.  At one point, we learn that he was rescued as a boy from being a caged circus freak and hidden in the bowels of the opera house, where he's spent his entire existence (think The Elephant Man, without any real drama or character development).  He is described as, \\"a genius, an architect, a composer and a magician\\", but there is no explanation of how he came to develop these talents while spending his youth hidden in catacombs, with apparently no formal education.<br /><br />After the intermission - rarely have I seen a movie musical that made it plainer where Act Two began on stage - Bravo! - he shows up at a New Year's masquerade, interrupting (thank God) the most insufferable musical number in my memory.  I believe that the Phantom's entrance in the Masquerade scene was the only way Mr. Webber could write his way out of the dizzying spiral momentum and endless repetition of that God-awful melody.  Although he recently murdered one of the employees of the opera house, none of the hundreds of people present think to rush and detain him, even though it is finally obvious that he is certainly no specter.  He then presents the theatre management with a new \\"opera\\", which they agree to stage with little discussion.  The score, by the way, is full of utterly ridiculous \\"operatic scenes\\" that would ring false to even the most casual opera patron; I would expect them to be laughed off the stage of any legitimate opera house of the past three centuries.  More puzzling still is why the Phantom champions the career of Christine over the diva Carlotta, when it is clear (or should be to anyone with ears) that at least Carlotta manages a few high C's, while Christine possesses the instrument of a second-rate 20th century pop singer.  This is a story about \\"opera\\" professionals, and a Phantom obsessed with opera?  There were more plausible opera moments in the 1962 Hammer film, which wasn't even a musical.  And there was far more horror in the Lon Chaney classic, which managed, even in 1925, to avoid the gigantic leaps of logic required by the ludicrous narrative presented here.<br /><br />The biggest plot hole gnawed at me like a rat in a garbage can.  The Viscount Raoul is supposed to be in love with Christine, and she him, their bliss threatened only by the presence of the menacing Phantom.  Like the proverbial Knight in Shining Armor, we never learn ANYTHING about Raoul, except that he is from \\"a powerful and wealthy family\\".  If he is truly powerful and wealthy, and so very much in love, why doesn't he simply take Christine away from the opera house to escape the Phantom?  Was the rent on her dressing room paid too far in advance, one wonders?  Of course, then there would be no story.  Story?  What story?  The hundreds of fans of the show who complain how much this film has ruined their beloved \\"best musical of all time\\", never seem to notice that the movie script at least bothered to flesh out the plot a hundredfold over the stage production, and it STILL has almost no story, and even less logic.<br /><br />If you remove the special effects and gooey love songs, this celebration of everything that is wrong with Broadway today collapses under the weight of its own inadequacies.  I give the film two stars for its sumptuous costumes and lavish sets, but if this can pass as \\"the best musical ever written\\" as so many seem to think, God help the future of Broadway.ting (thank God) the most insufferable musical number in my memory.

6305078491|4.0|A must-see, unforgettable German film from 1932, this one is mostly a silent film, with a minimum of audio effects when needed. Loosely derived from Sheridan Lefanu's Carmilla (the original \\"Lesbian vampire\\" story), Vampyr is like a surrealist nightmare. Spooky. <br />
B000M5AJQS|5.0|The moment the movie opens with a voice over from Jack Nicholson, \\"I don't want to be a product of my environment, I want my environment to be a product of me\\", and the Stones' \\"Gimme Shelter\\" comes blaring on the speakers, I knew I was in for a treat. Make no mistake, this is a movie of Scorsesean proportions, who continues to prove that he is eons ahead of the majority of people in Hollywood who claim to be directors. Having thoroughly enjoyed the Hong Kong movie from which this was based on, Infernal Affairs (or Mou Gaan Dou, as my friends call it), my expectation for The Departed was through the roof. Never one to disappoint, Scorsese expands the canvas that this movie was based on, breathing life to the characters, delving deeper into human emotions of not only the two leads, but those around them...and he has painted his masterpiece. I can safely say, this movie elevates movie making to the next level, surpassing some of Scorsese's earlier classics, The Goodfellas and Casino. <br /> <br />The story is brilliant in it's simplicity. The Irish mob in South Boston is headed by the ruthless, Frank Costello. Always one step behind him, lurking in the shadows is Detective Queenan who is dead set to apprehand Costello by whatever means necessary. Colin Sullivan is picked by Costello to enter the Massachusetts Police Academy as a cadet, and he eventually rises to the rank of detective in the Special Investigation Unit, and is Costello's eyes and ears in the police. By a cruel twist of irony, Detective Queenan has the same idea and sends rookie Billy Costigan, who has ties to the Mafia family, to infiltrate the Irish mob and report Costello's activities to the police. Things go as planned until both parties realize they have a mole amongst them. A cat and mouse game begins, to uncover who the mole is. The difference between this movie and the many out there, is that both groups consist of intelligent people constantly out-thinking one another. They match wits, and thereare many exhilirating moments in the movie, where you're not sure who's going to win. <br /> <br />Personally, what I really liked about The Departed is the moral implications this movie questions. Colin Sullivan and Billy Costigan are two people thrown into two complete different environments. Sullivan thrives in the new environment. He advances very fast, and is even contemplating starting a life with Madolyn, a phsyciatrist he met. Costigan however, is trapped in what he has been trying to escape his entire life. When he is with the mob, he shows no fear and has an air of bravado about him. But inside, you see a tortured man. He resents the kind of person he has become, to see the things that he has seen, to do the things that he does. Which brings me to my next point, put in that position on a long enough timeline, do you become that person? Do you become another person than what you set out to be? Towards the end of the movie, it is clear that this is no longer a battle between good and evil, right or wrong...it is about identity, knowing who you are, or who you want to be. This, to me is the epitome of great film making, movies that not only entertains, but challenges you to think. <br /> <br />Of course, conveying or strengthening this message is no easy feat, but this is where the acting comes to play, and I cannot think of a cast more talented than what Scorsese has reeled in here. Leading the pack is Leonardo DiCaprio playing Billy Costigan. I have stated time and time again, he is one of the brilliant actors of our time. Costigan is a violent man, yet he has a vulnerability accentuated when he is alone or with his phsyciatrist, Madolyn. Playing a bad guy is not easy, and you can see his decision weighing down on him. Exceptionally portayed by DiCaprio. Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan like the two-headed snake that he is. Sullivan is not a decent man, you can practically see the wheels turning in his head, concorting his next deception. Even when the oddsare against him, he comes up with a plan or a lie. And the role of Frank Costello seems custom made for Jack Nicholson. Playing a crazed, demented, sarcastic old man is nothing new for Nicholson, but unlike his many other movies, here he doesn't go overboard with it. He keeps it at bay and makes calculated risks. Costello has the attitude that provokes fear and Jack Nicholson easily manages to do just that. Supporting these fine actors are excellent performances from Martin Sheen, Mark Walhberg, Alex Baldwin and Vera Farmiga. Mark Walhberg especially is in fine form. Not since \\"Boogie Nights\\", have I seen such a splendid performance from him. <br /> <br />Another thing that impresses me about the movie is the way the story unfolds and the cinematography. In true Scorsesean style, the script is peppered with trademark scenes that stick in your mind. The camera shots were marvelous and sets the tone for the movie. The violence is gritty and real. No excessive and unnecessary sound effects here. And there are humorous moments in the movie which actually works in favour to some of the scenes. I have watched this movie 4 times and like an onion, there are layers that upon peeling, you find new appreciation for. Another noteworthy aspect of The Departed is the music selection, handpicked by Scorsese himself. It's a throwback to the glory years of rock with The Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, John Lennon and The Allman Brothers. It blends perfectly with the movie and definitely adds to the cool factor, if anything else.  <br /> <br />This movie has already been nominated for a slew of awards and who knows, Marty might finally win the Oscar that has so far eluded him all these years. This movie might not be for everyone, but I can assure you, if you're looking for an intelligent movie that not only entertains but leaves you thinking, a movie with unrivalled performances from it's star-studded cast, look no further...this is it. Leave it to Scorsese to take an already excellent movie and lift it up to dizzying heights in what I feel is a true representation of a modern day crime classic, The Departed. Definitely a step forward in America cinema, highly recommended!

B000FS9FCQ|1.0|I will put up with a lot from certain films.  I don't mind low budgets, inexperienced actors, flawed screenplays, etc., if the film has something good to offer.  That's one reason why I liked \\"Bound,\\" an earlier low budget offering from the Wachowski brothers.   <br /> <br />But I won't put up with a run-your-agenda-down-your-throat film from anyone. <br /> <br />What's the difference between a normal film and. a run-the-agenda-down-your-throat film?  Well, for starters, the latter will feature \\"good\\" characters as wonderful, happy people with no character flaws whatsoever, while the \\"bad\\" characters will be completely corrupt and evil with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever.  A lot of writers have written stories as simplistic as this - when they were nine years old.   <br /> <br />Of course, a lot of great art was created with an agenda in mind.  Steinbeck's stated purpose in writing the Grapes of Wrath was to create sympathy for the plight of the migrant farm worker.  But he created memorable, well-rounded characters and a mature storyline, and in the process created great art - none of which V for Vendetta even tries to do. <br /> <br />But don't take my word for it - decide for yourself.  Might this film have an anti-Christian, pro-gay agenda or no?  Let's see: <br /> <br />1. The evil government is a fascist Christian theocracy, with a modified cross as symbol in the color scheme (red/black) of Nazi Germany. <br />2. Every representative of the government is completely evil and corrupt with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever <br />3. This evil government locks up/kills homosexuals for walking down the street hand-in-hand <br />4. We are told that this Christian theocracy arose because of \\"America's War,\\" while we see news footage from Iraq <br />5. Despite this current events reference, apparently showing a desire to root the film in reality, no acknowledgement is ever made that this type of \\"oppression\\" and \\"fascism\\" isn't actually happening in democracies.  That is, neither North America nor Europe actually haul off and kill homosexuals, but current Muslim theocracies like Iran and Saudi Arabia do. <br />6. Despite this, a gay TV producer owns a copy of the government-outlawed Koran, which he says he likes for its \\"poetry.\\"  Somehow its denunciations of gays and exhortations to kill them doesn't faze him <br />7. The same gay TV producer is taken away by jackbooted thugs for criticizing the government, and later executed for owning a copy of the Koran <br />8. With the possible exception of \\"V,\\" every protagonist is a wonderful, well-adjusted and giving character with no character flaws whatsoever.  Even Natalie Portman is so good-hearted she forgives V for imprisoning, torturing and humiliating her, falls in love with him and commits terrorism for him in the name of their \\"love.\\" <br />9. We are treated to an overly long flashback of a wonderful, well-adjusted and giving lesbian character with no character flaws whatsoever who recounts how she \\"just wanted to love in peace\\" but was hauled off, tortured and executed by the Christian Theocracy just for being gay. <br />10. The head of the Christian church is an accomplice to murder and torture, is overtly corrupt, and is a pedophile.  Oddly enough, however, he is fixated on underage girls, not boys.  But why not?  After other attempts to have the film vaguely reflect reality, why not portray what is unfortunately the norm of priest pedophilia scandals, that is, man-boy?  Could it be that to portray homosexuality in any less-than-favorable light would be unacceptable? <br />11. Despite the worldwide concerns about terrorists and their attacks against civilians in dozens of countries worldwide, the apparent goal of the film is for the viewer to better understand why a terrorist would blow up buildings, murder innocent civilians and take down a government (?????) <br /> <br />No, I'm sorry, this film was one long agenda-spouting travesty from start to finish.  Ireally expected more from the \\"Matrix\\" team.  I can't even get into production design, acting, cinematography and the rest because I couldn't get past the relentless - and I do mean RELENTLESS - agenda.  So, if you want to see aggressively anti-Christian, anti-American, ham-handed pro-gay propaganda that talks down to you as if you were a three-year old, this is for you.   <br /> <br />Otherwise - avoid. <br />
0743289684|5.0|This is an extremely important work as it reflects the growing emergence of enlightened women's sensibilities in the world of Islam. It is a clearly written accounting illustrating the kind of intellectual and emotional journey many Muslim women around the world are experiencing as they gain education and freedom of thought. Ali's story will likely be carefully, and eagerly, considered by Muslim women and those of us who want to understand Islam better, from a woman's point of view. Ali's journey is also important for all of us, Muslim or not, women or not. Why? I'm an evolutionary biologist who writes about social conflict and war and the effect that silencing women in matters of war has had on the human history of war (\\"Women, Power, and the Biology of Peace\\" by Judith L. Hand (not Latta)). The global empowerment of women and their participation at planning sessions and negotiating tables--women from all sides of our many conflicts--is the necessary, critical catalyst for creating a better, less violent future. By so clearly presenting her own journey, Ali shines a light that clarifies an arguably necessary reformation that must occur within Islam if that better, less violent future, is to be created for the benefit of us all.

B000001FA4|4.0|This was U2's first collaboration with Brian Eno, and also something of a breakthrough for them (though the real commercial breakthrough for them would be their next album, The Joshua Tree, that made them one of the world's most famous bands). Brian Eno's production is quite idiosyncratic:  some of the songs are really long, some are really short, and they look as if they were unmixed; this is a messy, untidy album, but to me this is part of its appeal. The most famous song from the album is Pride (in the name of Love), a song about Martin Luther King. But the album has other very good songs, like the haunting A sort of Homecoming, Promenade and Indian Summer Sky. All in all, a very worthwhile album.
0553381350|3.0|You carry your expectations to a book, and this one was a disappointment to me.  This book, in my view, offers a sophisticated version of hero worship.  But, while showing many of the foibles of the characters, it is worshipful and indeed, facile myth generation.  You get a bunch of you-are-there style descriptions - the kind of light stream-of-consciousness that made Wolfe famous as a hip young beat journalist - and they are fine as far as they go, but at least for me, I felt there is far too little substance behind it.<br /><br />In spite of Wolfe's somewhat cynical veneer, the characters fall into some pretty simplistic stereotypes.  You get the tough, natural aristocrat, Chuck Yeager, the real yet unknown superstar, and then you get the media-sensation astronauts, who are promoted for political propaganda reasons.  Thus, there is John Glenn (\\"the clean marine\\")  and a host of other less colorful characters.  I did not feel I got to know much about them.  Glenn, whom I worked for in the Senate 20 years ago, comes off as the most boring of straight men, which I don't think encompasses him well at all.<br /><br />Then there is the period of history in which it all takes place, the Cold War.  Wolfe offers nothing much of interest about this frightening period of technological competition between the US and USSR.  I felt it was just kind of a useful background for Wolfe.  This stands in stark contrast to Wolfe's wonderful Electric Coolaid Acid Test, which really plumbed a lot of the 1960s psychedelic spirit - that was why I expected so much more, I suppose.<br /><br />I would recommend this as a fun read, but not much beyond that.  It is strictly throwaway and does not demand much concentration or stimulate the reader to dig deeper elsewhere, which for me signals a failed reading experience.
0060833459|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  It is written in an old-school style that is somewhat hard to get through.....but the messages are very clear.  This book totally changes the way you think about your role in an organization - regardless of your rank or profession.  It's definitely a book you should read at least twice.
0618680004|1.0|Richard Dawkins clearly has very little understanding of religious theology, and his venturing into it is about as welcome as he would be venturing into the field of sports reviews. <br />It is very clear that Professor Dawkins feelings are driven by personal distaste rather than reason. Particularly the chapeter \\"Why there is almost certainly not a God.\\" The words \\"almost certainly\\" leave the door of doubt open, but in response he states that it is equal to saying there is almost certainly not Thor (an unoriginal premise, Bertrand Russell equated is own agnosticism to his lack of belief in Greek Gods). <br />Richard Dawkins is known not only for his contempt for creationism, but also for his unwillingness, or perhaps sheer ignorance, to Inteligent Design. <br />His attempts to unravel the extistential theology of St Thomas Aquinas and St Anselm appear ammateurish, and it clearly shows Professor Dawkins is out of his league here. <br />What this work basically ammounts to is a personal attack driven by personal distaste. Professor Dawkins may be of the mind that we are all the improbably winners in a cosmetic and genetic lottery, with no first cause. Fine, Professor Dawkins is welcome to his own opinion. But to write an attack upon religion, with no appreciation of the message, the historic basis, and a very limited understanding of the philosophic reasoning really is stepping out way too far. <br />Professor Dawkins is best suited to biology, and his contradictory, paradoxical, anti theistic arguments are best suited for unrecognition.

B000GG4XJM|5.0|Like Walt Whitman, it's the America of carpenters, mechanics and boatmen that greets the ear in this latest Bruce Springsteen effort.  An older America, in the voices of the commonplaces of a shared past now forgotten by the old or never learned of by the young, rises in these songs to remind us of who we are, or were. <br /> <br />     This is Springsteen's fourth album-length foray into folk music.  Nebraska is regarded by many members of the Church of Springsteen as his best work; \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\\" featuring his elegaic \\"Youngstown,\\" won Bruce a Grammy as best new folk release in 1995.  The spiritually-themed \\"Devils and Dust\\" topped the charts in 2005, with a title track exploring the psychological tension inherent in Iraq War (\\"We've Got God on our side...When I look into your eyes, all I see are devils and dust.\\")  Bruce also covered Woodie Guthrie's \\"This Land Is Your Land\\", released on his first live album, covering the years 1975-85.  That effort was explicitly done, both by Guthrie, and by Springsteen, as he tells is, as a protest to Irving Berlin's patriotic offerings.   <br /> <br />     Bruce has been, since I was 16, nearly 30 years ago, unknowingly singing my and my family's autobiography in his music.  Descended from a race of James Webb-esque blue-collar Joes, nearly all the men veterans, we could've stepped out of the lyrics of many of his songs.  From \\"Adam Raised A Cain\\" to \\"Youngstown,\\" he never lost his focus (the \\"Human Touch\\" years excepted) on Joe and how Joe was trying to make a living, get his girl, and about his love for cars and the freedom of being behind the wheel, with one's fate in one's own hands.  Even the misunderstood Born In The USA has it's place in telling the story of people like us - it was penned as a protest against the indifferent treatment of returning Vietnam veterans.  (Ironically, at the Vote For Change concert, with a more explicit theme behind the performance, the college kid in front of me still pumped his fist in the air in rythm with the music on \\"Born In The USA,\\" either oblivious or uncaring of the meaning of his chosen expression of patriotic.)  \\"My Hometown\\" resonates with me across two decades - from watching my father's job disappear in Detroit, circa 1980, to seeing the faces of factory workers today.   (My job involves outplacement help for people facing layoff, much of it NAFTA/GATT-related). <br /> <br />      As to why a paleoconsevative like myself should be interested in self-described Progressive Bruce Springsteen's latest foray into folk music, hardly renowned as a bastion of conservatism.  Two reasons:  His social commentary, set to music, often finds common ground with paleoconservative ideas.  If the current causes that most unify us center on the Three I's (Immigration, Imports and Iraq), then the Boss is right on the latter two, and if the resurgence of a more traditional wing in the Democratic Party, personified in Bob Casey, Jr. and James Webb, is a harbinger of things to come, them we have common ground with a rising political movement. Secondly, and most importantly, for paleos, politics isn't everything, and everything isn't political.  Springsteen's latest offering is traditional, rooted in the American experience, and generally has no overt politics about it.  Springsteen famously rebuffed both the Reagan and Mondale campaigns in 1984, and prior to 2004's \\"Vote For Change\\" tour, had not, to my knowledge, made partisan endorsements.  Even then, his \\"public service announcement\\" during the concert in Detroit (talking to his audience is a signature Springsteen item), he made his views known without hate, rancor or name-calling. <br /> <br />      Springsteen is, well, different.  Until I heard \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" (the album featuring \\"Adam Raised A Cain\\"), I'd never heard a rock `n' roll song on the subject of the artist's father.  Jobs, family life - the subject matter was adult, in a way that the Beach Boys, or nearly anyone thisside of Johnny Cash, just couldn't be.  Bruce grew up, personally and musically, and took us along for the ride, while other acts went grey, still singing about teenage angst.  The Magic Rat, Rosalita, and the other characters who peopled the songs of his first albums, through his breakthrough Born To Run in 1975 gave way to first-person characters and their struggles to make it against the odds.  Most of the songs left you wondering if they ever made it, but you knew that they were trying.  And, in the midst of the despair that could make Bruce sing, You're born with nothing/And it's better off that way/Soon as you got something/They send someone to take it away he'd come back with, And I believe in the Promised Land on the same album.  (And I still believe in the Promised Land,  Bruce.)          <br /> <br />     \\"We Shall Overcome, American Land Edition\\" is Bruce's second offering on the same theme, the music of Pete Seeger, following the 2006 release of \\"We Shall Overcome, The Seeger Sessions,\\" which offers a CD on one side and DVD on the other.  The latter has live performances of  five songs featured on the reverse, along with two bonus track (\\"Buffalo Gals,\\" an Erie Canal-era song, plus the Civil War-era hymn \\"How Can I keep From Singing\\") and documentary about the making of the album.   <br /> <br />     Both versions began as a tribute to Pete Seeger, in whose honor one track was recorded in 1997 (for a tribute album), all the songs are live, unrehearsed and acoustic.  Many of these songs I learned from Mrs. Watson, who was in her 50th year as a music teacher when I started elementary school in a working-class suburb of Detroit in the 1960s.  When she retired, their words and melodies faded from ears of those who followed me. The next generation of kids grew up singing Boomer anthems from the 1960s (stuff by the Fifth Dimension, Joan Baez, etc.), and the thread linking them with the long-dead Americans who gave them their first life was severed.  Until now.Springsteen is enough of an institution, over 30 years after simultaneously appearing on the covers of both Time and Newsweek, that whatever he does gets attention, and sells well.  (the phenomenon has been given a name:  `The Springsteen Effect.')  <br /> <br />     These songs resonated with me more than all the half-forgotten hits from my childhood years They make me feel like I'm home.  Perhaps it's that they are part of America's fabric, in a way that music that is identified only with the generation that produced it can never be. Music for a season bows to music for all seasons. <br /> <br />     Of the actual performances, the spontaneous harmony of each song is actually a wonder, given the unrehearsed, unedited nature of the recordings. Not that all is perfection; Shenandoah could've used clearer vocals from Bruce at a few points, and I'm not a fan of Jesse James as a subject for song, but I cannot fault the performance in that case. (I can fault trying to turn Jesse James into a latter-day Robin Hood, however, which the song bearing his name does.)   The others range from very good to deeply moving (\\"We Shall Overcome\\" and \\"O Mary Don't You Weep\\"). All of the performances are of good-enough quality to make skipping any an act of self-denial.  Let's hope that this is the first of a long line of resurrections of traditional American music - in itself, an act of spiritual and cultural patriotism that transcends the superficiality of most of what mass media feeds the masses daily. <br /> <br />     This may be the first time, since national mass media became a reality via radio in the 1930s, (Richard Weaver's \\"Great Stereopticon,\\" the techno-cultural megaphone that allows it's owner to nearly monopolize popular culture) that music has the potential for multigenerational appeal.  I know that my late father liked some of these songs, and would've enjoyed this collection.  \\"Shenandoah,\\" \\"John Henry,\\" \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" and \\"Froggie Went A Courtin'\\" are as old as the American soul.    <br /> <br />     Thus, after a long silence, America may have begin to find it's traditional voice again.  I felt something similar while watching Ronald Reagan's funeral, listening to the classic music that he selected in advance for the inevitable good-bye.  Peggy Noonan wrote about it, after both the Reagan and Ford funerals, asking why we don't hear more often our best American music, because it touches its hearers (of a certain age, at least) so deeply, except at State funerals and similar occasionsn.  If a Presidental state funeral is High Church America, musically, then perhaps this collection of songs is its Low Church counterpart. That same longing for the permanent things, may be what drove the Boss, and drives his listeners, to embrace these old songs again. <br /> <br />       Returning to the music itself, \\"Erie Canal\\" is actually, according to Bruce's liner notes, dates from 1905, not the 1820s, the heyday of canals, but it has more authenticity, as folk music, than the sanitized, pop variety popular in the 1960s (think the '90s movie \\"A Mighty Wind\\").  Several songs were actually hymns;  without losing all their religious meaning, they are better known for their connection with the Civil Rights movement.  \\"Eyes On The Prize\\" and \\"We Shall Overcom\\"e were, of course, signature pieces from that era, and most listeners doubtless remember them in that context, and not from Sunday mornings.  \\"Pay Me My Money Down\\" is an old sea shantry, according to the liner notes, which gained new life on the lips of black stevedores in Charleston, in protest over being defrauded of their due by unscrupulous ship captains.  Covered previously by The Kingston Trio and Jerry Garcia, the labor movement has also adopted it for their own.  \\"Froggie Went A Courtin'\\" was on Scottish lips long before it came to our shores.  (In addition to a Seeger rendition, it was covered by the artist Springsteen was compared to, early in his career - Bob Dylan)  \\"BuffaloGals\\" is a romp, and \\"How Can I Keep From Singing,\\" done          a cappella, could've come out of a Sunday morning service. \\"How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?\\" takes us back to a 1920's-era flood of New Orleans, without having to say anything about the present - the relevance is too obvious.   <br /> <br />     The '60's-ear anti-war \\"Bring `Em Home\\" preceeds the last cut, \\"American Land.\\"  Although framed in terms of the imagery of the generations who passed through Ellis Island, the song's presence here can be read, in the context of Springsteen's earlier works on Tom Joad, an endorsement of a more liberal immigration policy.  <br /> <br />     Best of all, it's obvious, in every song, that they were having fun, and it's fun to listen in.  (If the semi-Randian heroics of \\"John Henry\\" doesn't lift your spirits, you're probably asleep.)  I hope it's the start of something greater than itself, like the reclamation of the American soul from relativists, multiculturalists, and the rest of that crowd.
B000H5TVKI|4.0|The Blu-ray version of this looks amazing.  I bought the \\"ultimate edition of the standard DVD a few years ago and this looks notably better - even compared to the former's image being upscaled.  This is is the type of picture I expect out of Blu-ray.  Not being a Hi-def rocket scientist, I can't speak too much for the sound quality other than it sounds great.  I don't have the euipment to process DTS-HD, so I can only assume that it sounds better than what normal DTS provides.  The extras on the disc are the same as on the ultimate edition DVD, so you're not losing out on anything like in some of the other Blu-ray ports.  My only complaint is this:  Lionsgate has got this thing for having the pop-up menu take up most of the screen.  Given that the other studios have gone with a nice, low-profile menu that only appears at the bottom, I hope that Lionsgate will adopt this practice sometime in the near future.  Other than that, if you're a fan of 'First Blood' I can easily reccomend this disc.
076790592X|4.0|This is an interesting book. Certainly Albom is no Shakespeare and this book fails to reach any literary heights, however it is a compelling read. I found it sort of similar to a car crash, I wanted to stop, but couldn't. Knowing that Morrie would die in the end just seemed to make the dialogue between Morrie and Albom that little bit more enthralling. <br /> <br />My father died about 2 years before I read this book. All the while I was reading it I wished that I had had some of the conversations with him that Albom had with Morrie. In some ways reading this book was a cathartic process as it allowed me to picture what those conversation with my Dad would have been like. Maybe by reading this book you may be encouraged to have some of those conversations with the people close to you while you have the chance.
B000M06K5C|5.0|I was at first largely unimpressed by Weekend in the City after listening to it for the first time, but since Silent Alarm had been the kind of album that grows on you I hoped that further listens would wield a better experience. Sure enough, all it took was one more listen and I was infinitely more astounded by the quality of the music than I was the first round through. Not only that, but I would actually go the extent of saying that Weekend in the City goes a small step above the debut. On this album Bloc Party leans towards noticeably calmer pieces, but this gives you a chance to better acknowledge how skilled they are at performing softer songs. On Silent Alarm, the smooth beauty of pieces such as \\"Blue Light\\" sat among jams such as \\"Luno\\" and \\"Helicopter\\", but on Bloc Party's sophomore release it is easier to pay attention to their catchy, time-taken lyrics as they are sung overtop of non-heavy gems such as \\"Kreuzberg\\" and \\"SRXT\\". By no means do I prefer Bloc Party's soft side to their heavy side 100% of the time, however. My four favorite tracks on Weekend in the City actually have the loudest riffs in them, including the colossal \\"Uniform\\" (now my favorite Bloc Party song), \\"Song for Clay (Disappear Here)\\", and 2 exclusive tracks found at the end of Target's version called \\"The Once and Future King\\" and \\"Secrets\\" (I highly recommend this version, by the way). This album also has the same level of memorable lyrics as on Silent Alarm; phrases such as \\"you should have asked me for it\\" and \\"you make my tongue loose\\" will likely stick in your head for days. If you have listened to this CD already and didn't enjoy it the first time, definitely give it another chance since it is a phenomenal album and one that has tremendous potential to grow on you. I would give Weekend in the City five stars and would probably equate it to Silent Alarm, though it might be a smidge better. In my opinion, this is definitely the best album of 2007 thus far.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I've been listening to music for 40 years, and it's rare for me to write fan mail.  However, I can't think of any other group that does to me today what the Beatles did 40 years ago--Wilco makes me wish I could walk up and shake their hands and say \\"Thank you\\".  That's how much I like this album.  It's innovative, beautiful music that doesn't have a bit of extra crap thrown in.  Unlike some bands, Wilco even makes \\"noise\\" sound like an essential part of the music--it isn't artsy-fartsy at all.  Anyway, you get the point--buy this album, listen to it 5 or 6 times, and you'll want more.

0815411839|5.0|I bought my first book on MM back in 1982 (Yep, it was Robert Slatzer's book!).  Since that time, I have read close to 20 books on MM.  I think for anyone who wants the closest thing to the truth regarding, among other things, Marilyn's death, her supposed \\"secret marriage\\", and her reported \\"affairs\\" with both John and Robert Kennedy, this is the book to read.  Great job by Donald Spoto!  He captures the real woman behind the MM mystic.  I love the chapter of MM entertaining the troops, and how great an experience it was for both her and the soldiers.

B000H5V8DG|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm an Alias obsessee. But the packaging for this item was horrible. I received the first one and 90% of the discs were scratched. I then received a replacement and every since one of the discs were scratched. The box sleeves are just not a good structure at all and damage the discs. It will be much easier to simply have all of the seasons separately, the discs have a much greater chance of not being so damaged then.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I thoughly enjoyed the series. Each episode presents a thread to underlying plots that keep you coming back for more. The only thing bad about the Firefly series is that it was canceled!

B000A2H812|3.0|In my first experience of Gogol Bordello, a friend layed a track on me, had me listen to it, loud, headphones on, without any explanation. Which, I must say in retrospect was just wrong. This album requires a full Surgeon General's Warning, advising those with a proclivity towards sensory induced migraines or temporal lobe siezures to lay down the iPod and step away. I mean, I don't want to say this highly energetic music is bad, but I sure don't have the correct anti-siezure meds to get through it. So, enjoy. It's all yours.
B000E41MS6|4.0|The \\"New Dr. Who Series, First Series,\\" starring Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, is absolutely wonderful! The writing is outstanding, the cast and crew excellent, and the special effects far and away out-do anything ever seen in Dr. Who before (See the Dr. Who Original series, 1963-1989, and other extraneous productions). I'm only saddened by C. Eccleston's decision to leave so early (he could easily have gone on another season or two), and the \\"single episode equals one story\\" format simply cannot match the \\"serial\\" format of the original -- there's simply not enough time (tee, hee)to develop the stories or characters the way the \\"original\\" <br /> series did; the 3-4 episode length stories (average) of the original series, with the \\"cliffhanger\\" endings and tie-ins, were far and away the best way to go. I will be happy to buy the \\"next series\\" with David Tennant as the Doctor, in hopes that the people at the BBC are \\"raising the bar\\" with his Doctor! But, back to Christopher's Doctor -- every true \\"Whovian\\" must have this set, it's really Doctor Who as it should be in the 21st century (at least in this galaxy). ~~ Matty
B000M4RG42|5.0|this is really a great film worth buying but i'm really upset that the dvd has no extra's it should be a 2 or 3 dvd set loaded with interviews from the family's what's up with that mr. eastwood somebody at dreamworks needs to get to work on a 2 dvd set real soon.
B000M06K5C|5.0|i was hooked on silent alarm as soon as it came out.  Weekend In the City has the same effect on me, but perhaps more so.  I'm obsessed with this record.  I know it's not everyone's 'cup o tea' and i can't fathom that.  every single song is flawless to me and this is no easy task for a band to do, for my discerning ears.  the record feels very balanced and the two bonus songs are more than bonus songs; they fit perfectly at the end.  i won't bash on anyone who doesn't like the record, i just don't understand them.  it may all come down to individuals who's lives happen to be aligned with this music.  sometimes we find a record that perfectly describes us at a particular point in time.  this is that record for me now.<br /><br />Get the record!  I bet you'll love it.
0446613444|5.0|MICHAEL CONNELLY IS A MASTERFUL ENTERTAINER.  I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY MORE BOOKS IN THE HARRY BOSCH SERIES.  THEY'RE GREAT.
B0000028SU|3.0|With the exception of Book of Dreams, there isn't a bad song on this album! Several mediocre ones (Big Muddy; Leap of Faith; Local Hero; Souls of the Departed), but several I like (title song; Living Proof; If I Should Fall Behind; Better Days; My Beautiful Reward). Really, I don't see why this is so despised when eighth-rate works like Nebraska and Tunnel of Love are lauded: it's no Born to Run, and it's sheer mediocrity, but I'd take mediocrity over awfulness any day.
B000K7UBTI|1.0|This was appalling. I actually watched the whole thing, hoping it might get any better. Being a die-hard Iron Man fan, there are too many flaws to list. Not even remotely close to the true story. What were they thinking?!?! Do not buy, rent, borrow, or glance at this movie!!!
B000M06K5C|5.0|For what feels like forever, fans begin to worry when the next album comes out that the artist explores new things that alienate the die hard fan. <br /> <br />Well don't be dissapointed. <br /> <br />\\"A Weekend In The City\\" covers the feelings, emotions, the so-called life of the city that inspired Kele Okereke (lead singer) for this album.  You'll find subjects of the lonliness of commuting to terrorism.  But just because the album is about a city shouldn't exclude fans that don't live in cities, no actually it's almost a monologue of someone having \\"A Weekend In The City.\\" <br /> <br />In terms of beat and sound, it's the same Bloc Party you know and love.  That's not to say it's no different from their previous album:  Silent Alarm (which you should also check out if you haven't).  You'll notice that Kele leaves room for the beats and does not try to overpower them with vocals.  I don't want to say it's a perfect mix because no one is perfect, but Kele's vocals complement the beat and rhythm.  You got the same catchy tunes that got you hooked, but you got Kele's vocals and lyrics that have the depth to make you go: \\"Wow did he really just say that?\\" <br /> <br />For example in the song \\"Hunting for Witches,\\" I was tapping to my foot to the beat getting into the song, but then realized Kele just said \\"A newscaster says the enemy is among us, as bombs explode on the 30 bus...\\"  Made me feel a bit guilty.  But as I type this review, it's hard not to dance. <br /> <br />Stand out songs have to be \\"The Prayer\\" and \\"Uniform.\\"  But this is one of those albums that die hard fans can argue for days on which song is the best.  On their previous album you had favorites like \\"Banquet\\" and \\"Helicopter,\\" but here personally my two favorites are \\"Uniform\\" and \\"Where Is Home?\\"   <br /> <br />Bloc Party also released a music video of their song on this album \\"I Still Remember.\\"  For those fans that were a little dissapointed after hearing that song, I could agree but give the rest of the album a chance because it's not what you'd think it is.  I'd feel safe in saying, you will find one song on this album you really like. <br /> <br />P.S. Don't let the first minute of the first track \\"Song for Clay (Disappear Here)\\" trick you in how the whole album is going to sound.   <br /> <br />Remember, Bloc Party is notorious for tempo-shifting that gave us smooth sounds and quickly switching to fast tempos that get your foot tapping.  It is what we loved in their previous album \\"Silent Alarm\\" and you'll find it again in \\"A Weekend In The City.\\" <br /> <br />Amazing.  Definitely just as, if not better, than \\"Silent Alarm.\\"
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I'm glad that they have this season on out on DVD. I can't wait until season 8 comes out and then I'll have the entire season on dvd. Season 7...I actually don't really remember too much from it because I mostly taped it and I didn't go back to watch it since I was busy with school and work. But I know that some episodes were good and I can't wait to buy this. I am glad that they finall have seasons 1-7 on dvd after so many years of it being on.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Little Miss Sunshine is a pleasant, humorous, well-cast romp of a film.  It tries to hard to be that kind of non-PC that is actually so-PC today that it can cause the occasional eye-roll, but it still brings on the chuckles and moves a long with a great open good-heartedness. All the actors here do a fine job - Kinnear in particular considering the lack of attention he's recieved comparared to others in the cast.  A very pleasant and enjoyable film, but certainly not a classic or Oscar-worthy piece of film making.
0974153001|5.0|One look at the finished sample sculptures the author shows will have you convinced that it is far too advanced a book if you are a beginning sculptor, however, each step is laid out in detail with full color photos as well to help you achieve a similar, if not exactly the same, effect. My finished sculpture lacked the finer details of the author's example, but considering it was my first and I didn't follow all of the steps exactly, it still turned out pretty good. There are detailed instructions for creating both male and female people, their hair, and even clothing from polymer clay. Afraid you don't have the special tools necessary? Don't worry because she tells you how to make your own step by step. Though I thought the price was high at first, I realized that in this case the product totally justified the price.
B000J103PC|3.0|Prada is a thoroughly enjoyable Boss from Hell movie. Great casting, sets, costumes, music.  It's all Good.  It's also been done before. This movie genre falls in line with the Inspirational Coach and Inner City Teacher films that seem to be a requirement for most actors at some point in their carreers.<br /><br />Anyway, Streep lifts it to a higher level and it's well worth a viewing.
B00005RG6B|5.0|I am not quite sure why I waited so long to buy Operation Livecrime on DVD. Afer all, Operation Mindcrime was one of my favorite albums of all time. I first saw Queensryche's video \\"Gonna get close to you\\" on Headbanger's Ball on MTV back when they showed videos from all different genres. I was blown away by the groups creativity in sound and visuals. I went on to pick up \\"Warning\\" and the \\"EP\\" and then \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" was released. There were no words to describe the album but it was the only cassette that stayed in my car for weeks. I went to see them live at the Philidelphia Spectrum on this tour when they opened up for Metallica. It was a highlight of my life. This leads me to now. I guess I was afraid that the video would take away from my memory of being there live. I was very wrong. This is a testament of a band in its prime. This is a band giving everything they had to the audience. This was and still is a band that recreate everything from the album. This is a must have for any Queensryche fan and any fan of Progressive Metal. Now I just can't wait to get my hands on \\"Operation Livecrime 1 and 2\\" in their entirety. The DVD is excellent in video and 5.1 sound and really allows the lucky watcher to feel as though he or she is there. If I had the money everyone would get a copy for next Christmas. Take it from the Ronster Monster.
0312954468|5.0|This is the best work of fiction I have personally ever read, bar none.  If it is not historically accurate, well I wouldn't know and couldn't care.  The STORY is wonderful.  It is truly an epic saga and completely captivating.  I have read this book four times so far over the years.  Mr. Smith created characters so compelling and human that I feel as though they were real and mourn their loss.  I remember them fondly through the times between readings and eventually, as today, I pick up the book to be swept away by Egypt, love, passion and danger once again.  A truly memorable and worthy work of fiction.
1582701709|5.0|I very much enjoyed the message of \\"The Secret\\" which is basically about the law of attraction and the power of positive thinking. The message is  empowering and the book is very interesting and an easy read. The book is basically the script of the movie which makes it an excellent companion piece if you already have the movie.  <br /> <br />I have seen the movie several times but there is so much information coming at you in the movie it's hard to remember it all. This way I can review some of the points I want to recall without having to fast forward through the movie. Both the book and the movie together would make a wonderful gift for yourself or someone special because they are both so visually beautiful.

B00005JPGO|5.0|Set against the backdrop of the Lewinsky scandal, Americans realize why they weren't really aware of this crisis in Africa. Blood Diamond will inspire and challenge you. You'll also never look at diamonds the same way again.<br /><br />The movie belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio. Many people were surprised when he got nominated for this film instead of The Departed. I'm not. He's equally good in The Departed but Blood Diamond just wouldn't have been the same with any other actor. While I wish the film had received more awards recognition, I'm pleased that DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou were singled out for their performances.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|After watching the DVD for the 3rd time I can't believe I was so blind to a lot of the fact about global warming. It has opened my eyes in so many different areas of our miss use of our enviorment. I just hope it is not to late for all of us to make a difference. I for one am starting to change my way of thinking and acting about green power. I would highly recommend this DVD be shown in all work places and in all levels of the school system.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|I saw Half Nelson in the movie theater twice, and just admired it on every level. It's a very brave, daring movie. You can help but root for the characters in this gritty tale.<br /><br />I was so THRILLED when Ryan Gosling received an Oscar nomination for his role. The movie belongs to him and he demonstrated why he is one of his generation's most talented actors. If you haven't seen him in The Believer, you must.
B000022TSY|4.0|Great uncomplicated movie and nice to just sit back relax and watch somthing that wasnt to complicated
1594200823|4.0|I found this book an extremely fascinating read and quite an eyeopener. TOD is a very thought provoking discourse on where our food actually comes from and the so-called \\"military industrial complex\\". He has a very easy writing style and has obviously done his research. It is of great credit to his writing that he doesn't stand on a soapbox criticizing people for their choices. The book is peppered with very interesting facts and science explained in a contextual and simplified manner for just about anyone.  <br />Along the way one learns facts about the pervasiveness of corn in every facet of our diet. Aspects of an environmentally destructive monoculture and animal cruelty going into our McNuggets call attention to points we rarely think of or at worst turn a blind eye to. A large chunk of this book was quite a page turner (more on this later). A very topical discussion in this book was the entire concept of \\"organic\\" food and how this too has become more of a label. How are our dietary choices today ravaging the earth and our economic and environmental foundations ?  <br />One of my biggest concerns with this book are its rather obvious shortcomings in terms of what one can actually do about the problems he talks about. He does not outline any \\"truly practical\\" solutions to the industrial agricultural machine?  After all there are over 6 billion people on this planet and is \\"sustainable\\" agriculture of the boutique farm variety the answer? <br />The section on Polyface farms was terribly fascinating but then again the basic contradiction in this entire section is on how practical such a farm is. One need only look a few miles in any direction of an urban metropolis to find acres of farmland now occupied by McMansions and housing developments. All of this is pushing farmers further and further out (or out of business in some cases). Isnt one creating an equal or higher environmental cost by driving to a farm 100-200 miles away? The problem is that the book is filled with a large number of such realistic issues or dilemmas such as this that Pollan doesn't address.  <br />Towards the end, while some may disagree with me, I found his description of foraging for food and cooking his meal rather boring. Admittedly he had a rational argument for including this section on building a complete meal from scratch much like our ancestors were wont to do, but at every point I could only think of the impracticality of such an existence (or perhaps that was his point). In any event it was rather tiresome.  <br />But overall, I can only thank Mr.Pollan for this excellent book that made me think about some of the choices I as an individual could start to make. <br />The first thing I found myself doing after starting to read this book was to take a closer look at food labels.  <br />
0743518144|3.0|product explains in detail what strengths and weaknesses are.  It gives many examples of different types and weaknesses and you can go on line and find out what your strengths are.  At the end of the CD's, I found myself saying; \\"ok, what now?  What do I do now that I know my strengths\\"?
B000GY729M|3.0|I found Hot Fuss to be very good. On that CD, I really liked several of the songs and the rest were bearable to listen to. However, the only two songs that I liked on this CD were \\"Sam's Town\\" and When You Were Young.\\" The rest had problems that included annoying music, lyrics that didn't rhyme, and rather poor songwriting. \\"Bones\\" in particular was so horrible that I couldn't listen to half the song. In my opinion, this album was average to bad.
1891252089|5.0|This is a great book for beginner to advanced.  It was recommended to me by my Ashtanga Yoga instructor.

B000BPFBVW|5.0|I'm fascinated by anything in surround-sound but the high-definition process used by Monster for the Superdiscs is phenomenal, putting you right there in the recording booth with the artists.    Highly recommended and versatile package includes Dolby and DTS tracks plus something not found elsewhere: digital files for your MP3 player in Dolby Headphone Surround.     You will not find better sound technology than this. A highly recommended grammy-winning album, \\"kicked up a notch\\".
B000FILW86|5.0|Easily one of the greatest (absolutely the most under-appreciated) American rock bands, Cheap Trick offers up an album that should have vaulted them back onto the charts. Stellar musicianship and concise, hook-laden songcrafting are evident in every track on 'Rockford'. From the opening blast of 'Welcome To The World', all the way to the snarling 'Decaf', CT shows why it has influenced such a wide range of modern acts like Green Day and My Chemical Romance. Robin Zander has long been known as the 'Man of 1000 Voices', but on this disc Rick Nielsen shows off his broad sonic range as well.  <br /> <br />Can anyone point to another band from Cheap Trick's era that is putting out music this enjoyable and relevant? Hello? Rock&Roll Hall of Fame?
B0001NBMEE|5.0|There is a certain spiritual quality to this movie, which i first saw as a youth at the Starr Theater in Bushwick, a theater that i considered my second home on the weekends as i paid my 50 cent and immersed myself in the timeless tales of heroes and honor and redemption.  The purity and the innocence of Prince Valiant was what struck me the most about this movie... how he saved his father's honor and that of king arthur.. the villans never do get the message... that god can defend the right ..and often does, not only in this movie but in others such as ..The Black Shield of Falworth. (Fidus Et Audax) Faith and Daring.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Once again I am not space coyote, but i did purchase this album.   The kids from New Jersey did it again with this blistering concept album.  As rock operas go this ones ranks up there with the best of them. With flavors of Pink Floyds the wall and undertones of oingo boingo this group has cemented itself as one of the most unique new acts today. If you dont like emo or dont even know what it is, I recommend this album because from start to finish it paints a picture with its theatrical lyrics and its over the top arrangments that will leave you humming the tunes all day.
1416524800|5.0|I have read all of his book but this one was't like the others.  It is nice value (dollor amount wise when you compare with other off-line book store price ) but I don't recomand this book.
B000HEZF0O|4.0|This is a great collection of action movies that every DVD collector needs to have on Blu-Ray. High definition only adds to the enjoyment of these films and with the price at only $69.95 it is one of the cheapest ways to get a bunch of blu-rays fast. Being that this is the first box set released to Blu-ray, it makes me very excited for other boxsets to appear in the future. This one packs plenty of bang for your buck. Great transfers, soundtracks and tons of extras make this one a four-star box set.
0920668372|5.0|Some of the sorry people who have reviewed this book cannot see it for what it is: a very touching book about the love between a parent and child. I read it to both my children and it was hard to get through without getting choked up. It reminded me of my mother and how much I continue to love her, and how much I know she loves me. Just recently I described the book to her when she was visiting me, and we were both bawling our eyes out by the time I finished. <br /> <br />My mother took care of me growing up and I hope to return the favor when she finally needs me. <br /> <br />If you actually think the mother picked up her grown son and put him on her lap, or drove across town and climbed a ladder, then you are being too literal and probably too uptight about it. <br />
B000K4WPCC|5.0|everyone might think that this movie sucked but it was a great movie with a great plot!!! It's a hit.
B00006AL1G|5.0|Goes down in my favorite hip-hop videos of all time.    My favorites are this, breakin, breakin 2, and freshest kids.     This actually helped lead me into breakdancing. From there I got [[ASIN:B000MR9JA8 How To Do The Robot - Breakdance Instructional DVD]] or [[ASIN:B000PITGUM Top 20 Breakdance Moves]]. These ones turned me from a hip-hop spectator into a serious breakdancer.    All of these are essential!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A review of this film stated that \\"you owe it to yourself to see this film.\\"  I think it more appropriate that you owe it to your children and grandchildren.  Those of us with kids will find this film to have a greater impact on our own behavior.  My household has changed significantly since seeing this film.  I believe this film has nailed this country's need to stop hiding behind political/popular arguments about global warming and its effects on all of us.  We have got to start approaching this problem with common sense, science, and a desire to MAKE change happen; instead of waiting for our leaders to do the right thing.  It's obvious that our government is so afraid to confront its oil addiction, that unless WE force it, it will never happen in time. PLEASE FORGET your POLITICAL convictions and WATCH THIS FILM!!!!!!- Then SHARE it with your friends & family.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a review from a man who has not seen the original short-lived TV series `Firefly.' I am a fan of sci-fi films, however, and I happened to notice many positive reviews about `Serenity,' so I gave it a try. <br /> <br />It is a pleasant surprise because the film is so good. Characters are lively, the dialogues are snappy and occasionally funny, and the film's story is intriguing. The special effects are very good (though some still need improvement), but what is remarkable about the film is the wits of the creator Joss Whedon who manages to keep telling this good, old Western-like adventure tale without making it too serious or self-referential.  <br /> <br />In short, this is what a good action film should be, and you can enjoy watching it without knowing anything about the history of the production. The film is about the crew of one spaceship in the future, and one ruthless `Alliance Operative' (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, \\"Kinky Boots\\") chases them, trying to retrieve a mysterious girl named River. The back story of the future world and the characters are cleverly explained in the opening, so you don't have to read long subtitles to understand them. <br /> <br />Like many other TV series that are loved by us for generations, \\"Serenity\\" presents the credible relations between the flawed but likable characters through a series of slightly episodic actions, and those relations are what really matters. Unfortunately, 2 hours are not enough for full character development, and some of them need more time for that. So my only complaint about the film is, I want more.
B000025RX4|5.0|A truly forgotten classic, the best recording by either Johnny Winter and Rick Derringer, no small claim since they both did excellent work on their own and with others. Together here for the first time, their combination of sizzling blues guitar and rock and roll chops meshed perfectly. Winter's leads and especially his slide playing throughout this recording are top notch, and Derringer's interplay with him is inspired as well.  <br />The songs are strong, with Derringer contributing four excellent tunes including his \\"rock and roll hoochie coo\\", which he would record on his own and score a big hit just a few years later. I prefer the version on this album. \\"on the limb\\" is a fine rocker with slick slide work from Winter and alternating lead vocals from Derringer and Winter.  <br />Winter's compositions are great also, especially \\"prodigal son\\" which has one of the greatest guitar solos I've ever heard. Johnny's vocals are soulful and strong throughout the album, his singing on \\"nothing left\\" is especially emotive.  <br />The covers chosen here are fantastic, including a killer version of one of my favorite songs, \\"no time to live\\" from Traffic's 2nd LP. \\"let the music play\\" by Allan Nicholls and Otis Stephens is a standout track also.  <br />Derringer's brother Randy contributes one song, \\"am I here?\\" which has a fresh approach and arrangement which contributes to the variety of the recording.  <br />This band would record a great live LP and then split up, but for this short time they were among the best, and this is one of the finest LP's released in 1970. I have not heard any CD version of this, as I am still listening to my original vinyl which is smoking hot. If you appreciate late sixties British blues ala Clapton,Page,Green,Simmonds,Alvin Lee,etc. and Hendrix,ZZ Top,Allman Bros.,Skynnyrd, you will certainly love this. <br />
B000002KHB|5.0|Deep Purple hit their peak with this one...Every song's a winner. <br />Too bad \\"Smoke on the water\\" gets so much airplay, at the expense of the other songs. Did you EVER hear \\"Lazy\\" on the radio? Blackmore, Gillan, Paice, Glover & Lord - The whole was greater than the sum of its parts. <br />The drumming is unbelieveable on this album!
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This DVD was not available in Australia and I had fond memories of the movie. I watched it the night it arrived and have since bought the soundtrack. Great music and the story is excellent. The service was great thumbs up.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I waited a long time for the release of this DVD and was not disappointed with it.  It was very thought provoking and I would recommend it to everyone that is interested in saving our planet.  It was well thought out and actually scary to think about what is happening to our world.  Everyone should see this film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I purchased this for my boyfriend and I thought it was going to be a dumb sci-fi show, but I loved it. It's too bad it got cancelled because it was great.  After watching the show I bought the movie Serenity because I couldn't get enough!
B000K2RD3U|5.0|This CD skips at 2:14 into Knots and 4:54 into The River. It's strange that there are so many problems with the GG remasters. Repertoire goes to the trouble of issuing a nicely packaged version of this, and apparently does not bother to review the final product before release. <br /> <br />Aside from the defects, this is definitely one of GG's best and unfortunately Phil Shulman's last recording with the band. Octopus sounds just as exciting to me now as it did in the early 70's. Since it's not GG's fault for this defective CD, I rated it 5 stars.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watched the show Firefly before I bought this movie and I think it helped me with the movie because I understood what everything was in the movie, but I thought that the movie was fantastic, just as good as the show.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I'm a 56 y/o white conservative male -- and I love the album.  I'll be highly disappointed if it doesn't take home some awards next week.  I highly recommend getting the Deluxe edition with the DVD.  Can't wait to share it with my two daughters.
B00004R99F|5.0|I watched this movie when I was probably 13 and loved it then, and after watching it after I bought it I still love it now that I'm older. It's a classic, and it's hilarious.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|The director's cut of Donnie Darko dwells too much on a bizarre sci-fi metaphysics of time travel. The original, more compact and eliptical, plays as a moody meditation on the omnipotent, interconnected and paranoid aspect of adolescent fantasy. Less is definitely more when it comes to Donnie Darko. <br /> <br />For me, the original cut is a terrific film, whereas the director's cut is overdone and lacks interest. <br /> <br />BTW: anyone have as guess as to why the film was set in 1988?
B000E97HIA|5.0|How can anyone give this album anything less than 5 stars? This album is a masterpiece, and one of Prince's best albums. There are only a handful of albums released in 2006 in which every track was top-shelf. 3121 has variety, depth, creativity, nuance, and just flat-out rocks the house! Prince is a musical genius. I really like his work of the 80s and 90s, but Prince's more recent music is his most mature (not to diminish his previous work), and quite simply his best. The guy has been on a creative high for several years now and I hope it never ends. I thought Michael Franti's \\"Yell Fire!\\" was the best album of 2006. 3121 comes in a close second.
B000IU3XTM|2.0|I like the melody of this album.. but the lyrics are really awful.  I thought O was a great album, but this one is just not that good.  Remember, this is just my opinion of his album.  Some people may find his lyrics in his album powerful, but i didn't feel that way for most of the songs.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|One of the best sci-fi movies that I have ever seen.  The storyline is fascinating and the character development is excellent. Everyone who enjoys science fiction will love this movie.
B000002I6T|5.0|I believe this LP ranks with the best N. Young and Stills solos and it should! After all, guest musicians include  members of: the dead, the Jefferson airplane, , Quicksilver messenger service and other artists like J. Mitchell, N. Young etc. it may have the record for guest significant/major recording artists on one solo LP. <br /> <br />Simply put this LP represents many \\"firsts\\" beside DC's \\"first\\" LP. This may be the \\"first\\" LP that N. Young contributed a song that can only be found here, I know of no other LP with as many major sanfransico/haight ashbury groups on one lp. This is the only LP on which you can find these songs. I don't know why they're not included in the box set, instead they include many CSN and CSN&Y songs...probably in order to sell it, which brings up another strange thing about this LP, the critics hated it. THANK GOD almighty I didn't read the reviews or I may never have bought this LP!!!! That was back when I didn't know better. I equate music critics on par with weather men and stock brokers - professions seemingly incapable of doing their jobs accurately no matter how much help they have!!!!  <br /> <br />Back to the music. I believe the quality in writing and playing place this LP beyond any solo CSN&Y LP and elevate it to equal any CSN and CSN&Y LP except deja vu. The only detraction I make when I place it par with these LP's is that it had no \\"hits\\" which we find abound on CSN and CSN&Y LP's.   <br /> <br />bottom line: if you like CSN and CSN&Y you will love this!!!!!!
B000E41MS6|5.0|I've been a Who fan for ages anyway, but I totally loved the First Series.  The stories were superior and Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper are loads of fun.  I'd seen a couple of the episodes on tv, but was even more impressed with the full series.  I'd expected there to be one or two duds in the set, since even with the best, that's often the case.  But there wasn't a bad one in the bunch!  Billie Piper is a perfect \\"companion\\".  She adds so much to every scene without stealing the thunder.  Eccleston is a great Doctor, I think.  I've been in love with a number of the others, and I half expected to feel a bit more critical, but he brings a depth and seriousness to the role and yet continues the adventure and fun of the part at the same time.  Quite a surprise!  He pulls off his own style and continues the tradition really excellently.  I wish he had done more episodes, frankly.  As it is, however, I fully expect to be watching and re-watching the First Series for a long, long time.
B000JLTRJ0|1.0|I was browsing for High def blue ray titles and decided to have Kung Fu Hustle as a start. I needed more BD titles and went into the seacrch list for BD titles. Then amazon automatically recommended World Trade Center as the disc collection to have with bonus material. Without looking into the fine print I ordered it. When it arrived I was bragging to my friends to come over for a premier of this movie in HD and to my surprise, it is only DVD quality. What a let down! I do not know who to be angry at. Amazon did no wrong because they did not misrepresent this movie as a BD title. But the impression I get is that it IS a BD title becvause that's what I searched for!! <br /> <br />Be careful when you sign on the credit card and confirm purchase. It is still prudent to check it a second time like all other shopping experience in territory you are not familiar with. Whether it is a discount store, or Amamzon. <br /> <br />k.s.
B000000W5N|5.0|Great album. Another one from the golden era 1968-1972, 'Brown Sugar', 'Sway', 'Bitch', all classics in their own right but the jewel is 'Can't you here me knocking', a true great. I truly suspect that Charlie Watts enjoyed himself the most on this track, mixing Santana style rhythms with jazz. All in all another brilliant album. Mick Taylor is so inspirational on this album, he's on top form and I think even Keith Richards admits that he learnt a lot from him.
1878424319|5.0|I made little cards with the 4 agreements and placed them everywhere. In front of my computer at work, my nightstand, in the kitchen, in my car. This way I make sure a stay connected with this wonderful tools and I can stay in peace, most of the time, I'm only human :)
B00006AW2J|5.0|This has got to be one of the best offerings from the Stones. The fantastic 'Sympathy for the devil' is by far the best track ever written by Jagger/Richards. No expectations is another as are 'Stray Cat Blues' and 'Street Fighting Man'. I think that this album has the best guitar in it before the introduction of Mick Taylor. The solos on 'Sympathy'and Stray Cat Blues must be some of the best by Richards, even though I think that he matured further next to Mick Taylor later on. Another very good track is 'Parachute woman'. This Album together with 'Sticky Fingers' and 'Let it Bleed' represent the Stones at their best.
B000M06K5C|3.0|Nobody will ever accuse their singer of being his generation's best songwriter. A lot of really good songs are hamstrung by crappy lyrics in my opinion. Your mileage, of course, will vary. And where Silent Alarm demands your attention, with a few exceptions this CD will fit right in with your housecleaning discs.
B000H1QYXY|5.0|George Michael can only get better w/ age! I have been a fan since the very beginning & i will continue to buy all his music or any DVD'S he puts out. I dont care what \\"religion\\" he practices he is simply Awsome!
B0000A0DXA|3.0|THIS DVD IS AMAZING!!...for all the wrong reasons. Anyone with an interest in Ulli Lommel needs to check out this DVD, as it is the definitive proof that he has totally lost his mind and his talent as a film maker. The original Boogeyman 2 was basically 50% flashbacks from the original Boogeyman movie and 50% new footage. What he has done with his 'Directors Cut' of Boogeyman 2, is get rid of almost all the original 'Boogeyman 2' footage and replace it with even more flashback footage from the first movie and new footage of himself (once again playing his director character from the original Boogeyman 2) in a white room talking to the camera as if it's a police interview. What we now have is about 85% flashback from the first Boogeyman, 10% Ulli talking to the camera and about 5% Boogeyman 2 footage shown in fast forward. Doing this makes no sense!!! He has made a bad film even worse!! As a bonus on the DVD there is an interview with Ulli which is further proof he has gone mad. He really seems to believe that this version is better and that he has made a good film. You must watch the interview, it is so funny to hear his thoughts on his work. He seems to be the only person that does not realise how bad his films have become. His earlier films such as the original Boogeyman and Devonsville Terror were not bad at all, but his more recent work such as Green River Killer and BTK Killer are some of the worst films to ever be made. There are also 2 trailers for other Boogeyman sequels   which also reuse footage. For someone like myself who is intrigued by how Ulli Lommel has become so bad, this DVD was worth every cent as it really highlighted the difference between his earlier style and newer style, and how bad he has become without being aware of it (the interview alone is worth buying it for). I have given this DVD 3 stars not due to its artistic merits (as it has none) or because it is a good film (it is not), but for the reasons outlined above.

B00005JKNF|5.0|Robert Altman had in Gosford Park a film unlike any I for one associate with this legendary director.  Stepping away from his usual canvas and setting foot confidently in England of the 1930's, Altman gets a lot of use out a large, capable cast that he no doubt drew together in part on the strength of who he was as a filmmaker. Telling its tale of a days-long gathering for a shooting party on a country estate, and doing a fine job of depicting the immensity of complications such events impose on the lives of those who truly bring it all together, the serving classes, Altman makes use of a slick and subtle inside joke in that every scene of the movie takes place only when at least one servant is in the shot. What starts off as a depiction of the logistics concerning the feeding, lodging, and care of an already by the `30's vaguely anachronistic gathering of upper-crust English society types gradually becomes instead a murder mystery a la Agatha Christie at her best. Far less about the people \\"upstairs\\" than the more personally substantial folk below, Gosford Park reveals itself degree by degree until revelations about furtive love, buried secrets, smoldering hatred, and hot-blooded murder come to light. It all makes for a complicated, understated, deceptively British-seeming film, and it is calls out for a closer second viewing soon after the first time it is seen.
B00005JPKC|5.0|\\"Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.  Especially those who've never been in one.  We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.  There's always plenty of both.  Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.\\"<br /><br />Those words are actually from the beginning of [[ASIN:B000O77QDI \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\"]] the first of two films from Clint Eastwood dealing with the battle for Iwo Jim during World War II.  That film was about the story behind [[ASIN:B000EEPJSU the photograph of the flag raising at Iwo Jim]] and what happened to the men in that famous shot (probably the most reproduced photograph in history).  But the sentiments apply as well to \\"Letters from Iwo Jim,\\" which tells the story from the perspective of the island's Japanese defenders.  The battle lasted from February 19, 1945 until March 26, 1945 and of the 22,000 Japanese troops entrenched on Iwo Jim, only 1,083 survived, with only 216 of that number being captured.  Allied forces suffered 26,000 casualties, with nearly 7,000 dead in the only large engagement of World War II against the Japanese in which the Allied forces suffered more casualties.  So we watch this 2006 film knowing that the Japanese are going to lose and that none of its characters may be alive by the time the credits roll.<br /><br />\\"Letters\\" begins with Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) arriving on Iwo Jim with orders to defend it to the last man.  Kuribayashi decision to build bunkers and caves rather than trenches on the beaches is viewed with skepticism by his subordinates, but would prove effective in holding the 5 mile by 2 mile island for over a month against an Allied force four times as large despite having neither naval nor air support.  In other words for the Japanese the Battle of Iwo Jim is like Thermopylae or the Alamo, except that losing the battle is not a prelude to winning the war.  The title of the film comes from letters being written home by the Japanese on the island, from the commanding general to the young baker named Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), who had to leave his pregnant wife to become a solider.  It is Saigo who is clearly the character with whom our sympathies lay because he is one of the few who really wants to be alive when the fighting is over.<br /><br />Both Kuribayshi and Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) challenge the stereotypical view of Japanese officers established in all those old World War II movies.  Kuribayshi studied with American officers in the United States and Nishi won a silver medal in horse jumping at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, so they have a respect for the Americans and an understanding that it is inevitable Japan will lose both this island and the war.  This contrasts sharply with those who yell about death before dishonor, but what stands out most is not the divisive rhetoric but the common human experience.  Nothing in the film humanizes the Japanese soldiers more than the thousand-stitch belts they wear, made by their mothers for them to wear into battle for good luck, and the irony that the most touching letter in the film is one sent to an American soldier by his mother is not lost on us.<br /><br />To say that \\"Letters from Iwo Jim\\" is an anti-war film is not particularly insightful because these days you would be hard pressed to find a pro-war film.  As the opening sequences of [[ASIN:B00001ZWUS \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"]] amply demonstrated, any realistic depiction of a war is going to convince most people they never want to be in one.  But that takes away nothing from those who have gone to war and done their duty.  It is impossible not to see these two films by Eastwood without thinking about the war in Iraq and it is very disquieting to be thinking that blowing yourself up with a grenade makes a suicide bomber look good.  Kuribayahsi had ordered his men to each kill 10 Americans before they die, so how the suicides of these Japanese soldiers conforms to the dictates of honor isincomprehensible.  Then there is the irony of one biggest proponents of honor and suicide being found in a hole just like Saddam Hussein.  In war heroism, cowardice, stupidity, propaganda, death, and so many other things are clearly eternal.<br /><br />I watched \\"Flag of Our Fathers\\" again to see to what extent the two films overlap, but there is nothing that stands out (I read that the American with the flame thrower is the only actor to appear in both).  Basically what the two films have in common is the setting of that rock in the Pacific, with its black sand beach (the film's original title was \\"Red Sun, Black Sand\\").  In \\"Letters\\" the flag atop Mount Suribachi is a small but significant object seen from the other side of the island by Kuribayashi.  My preference is for \\"Letters\\" over \\"Flag,\\" in part because I am less familiar with that side of the story, having seen \\"The Outsider,\\" the sobering 1961 film starring Tony Curtis as Ira Hayes, but also because almost all of \\"Letters\\" takes place on Iwo Jima and is more about soldiers fighting and dying.  Of course both films look at what the soldiers on both sides were fighting and dying for, which is why you have to make a point of seeing both films.s the irony of one biggest proponents of honor and suicide being found in a hole just like Saddam Hussein.

0679882820|5.0|What a great way to introduce our kids to Dr. Seuss.  It can be interactive or not-so, great for toddlers or babies listening to someone else make the noises.  My 2 year old has loved this book since we introduced it to her around 19 months.  She can remember most of the sounds almost exactly-it's awesome!

B000ICL3KG|2.0|I don't believe global warming is a proven fact or a hoax, but I do think the truth lies somewhere in between. Unfortunately, it may take decades if not longer to confirm or refute what Al Gore claims are FACTS in this movie. <br /> <br />I don't agree with many of the reviews here on Amazon.com that arrogantly state that global warming is fact not theory, and claim we already have IRREFUTABLE scientific data proving its being caused by the burning of fossil fuels. I also don't agree with reviewers that are equally as arrogant, when they dismiss any notion that our climate may be changing, and that humanity may be playing a part. Again, I believe the truth lies between both these extremes of OPINION. <br /> <br />Yes, many climate scientists believe that global warming is being caused by the burning of fossil fuels, but a minority of climate scientists dispute these claims. Unfortunately you don't hear their views in this movie, and that's a very good reason for all to be skeptical, if not suspicious about all the so called FACTS in this documentary. <br /> <br />It seems the whole subject of global warming has become much too political, with each side holding to their personal bias and unwilling to listen to any dissenting opinions. Missing in this discussion is rational debate, and a willingness from both sides to admit they DON'T have all the answers to this very complex subject. We need much more climate research by the scientific community, and much less biased reporting and heated political rhetoric. I strongly believe that we DON'T have the whole truth or a complete understanding about global warming or climate change, and anyone who thinks we do contradicts prevailing scientific opinion.  <br /> <br />Regardless if global warming is being caused by man, or is a natural climate cycle that we don't yet understand- we as a country and as individuals can and should be doing ALOT to help clean up our environment. What it will take is a President and a Congress that will inspire and motivate us with a real vision and real goals. It will also take a change in attitude and purchasing habits from the American consumer. With determination, adequate funding for research and established goals for our nation, WE CAN make positive changes that will make our planet healthier and less polluted. Hopefully we can even reverse some of the damage we have already caused. <br /> <br />As a nation, we should be doing everything possible to find alternatives to using fossil fuels. Not only because of the possible consequences of global warming, but also because of our increased dependence on Middle East oil and the obvious security implications. Politicians make a lot of speeches about ending our dependence on foreign oil, but in reality we have no true energy policy to accomplish that goal. Talk is cheap! <br /> <br />Finding viable alternatives to our fossil fueled economy won't be easy, and most informed Americans realize that there are no quick fixes. It will take a generation or more before alternatives like fuel cells, truly practical electric cars, cellulosic biomass fuels, improved solar power panels etc. are available to drastically reduce our need for fossil fuels. In the meantime, our government should be doing everything possible to accelerate research and development of these new technologies. We also need to give businesses and people incentives to use them. <br /> <br />In my opinion, if the Kyoto protocols were implemented by the USA today, the results would be devastating to our economy and result in mass unemployment and incredibly high energy prices. To survive and remain profitable, many US businesses and especially polluting industries would be forced to relocate to countries like China or India that are not affected by Kyoto's emission caps. <br /> <br />Don't believe that could happen?  Think about this. In the past fifteen years we have already witnessed the mass outsourcing of US jobs to countries with cheaper labor.Business leaders claim that this was necessary to keep them competitive in an ever increasing global economy. I believe that under current Kyoto emission restrictions, this trend to outsource US jobs and production would increase dramatically. <br /> <br />I think it's very important to note that even those countries that are most in favor of the Kyoto protocols have NOT been able to reduce their emissions anywhere near the stated goals of the pact. I will give them credit for trying, but it seems to prove that the goals of Kyoto are quite unrealistic and unworkable. There's also mounting evidence of the damaging economic consequences Europe is beginning to face, as it tries to fully implement Kyoto. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm sounding a bit optimistic and a lot like a capitalist, but I think the real solutions to our increasing global pollution problems, as well as our search for alternate energy sources, will only come from countries with robust and growing economies. Only those countries with strong economies will have the resources needed to invest in future research and development.  A shrinking or collapsing US or European economy may actually result in MORE pollution of all kinds, and HIGHER CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in the long run. <br /> <br />If unrealistic emission limits are imposed on the US which damages our economy, then I feel there is little real hope to developing viable energy alternatives to our fossil fueled economy <br />

B00003CXCT|5.0|I don't mind the new Star Wars trilogy, I'll even watch it again (...minus the Clones...), but the original trilogy is the one I keep on watching.<br /><br />I don't know about the changing of the effects except the explosion of the Death Star, and I really don't care. I like it when some things are cleaned up because with all these new effects in movies today your eye is just drawn to the old effects, but to tell you the truth I can't tell most of the time when they've changed something.<br /><br />I admire special effects, and there can be so much added to a story with its great use, but it is not essential. I love the Star Wars trilogy because of the story, the effects considering the time, and, most of all, the actors and their lines (no one beats Harrison Ford in the role of a sarcastic mercenary).<br /><br />Like most trilogies the three aren't equally good, but they stay equally entertaining throughout. In the case of the bonus material, I watched just about everything on there and enjoyed it all. Some bonus stuff released today gets very boring, but this material talked about the effects, the crowds and fans, and the actors. It was odd seeing the actors older, but it was enjoyable. I saw sides in Luke's actor he hadn't shown in the movie, which really makes me wish he'd been in more movies. Fun bonus material, very much worth it.<br /><br />Star Wars is such a classic series, everyone knows the name, but I'm always surprise when I find people who haven't seen the original series. I'm not saying watch it because it's a classic, but it holds its place in the best movies ever.<br /><br />You'll have to see it to know what I mean.

B000M06K5C|3.0|let me start off by saying i am a huge bloc party fan. Besides interpol, bloc party is my favorite band these days. i just bought the new album today and listened to it. don't get me wrong, it's very good, but it's not great. \\"The prayer\\" and \\"I still remember\\" are some of the best songs they have ever put out, but some of the other tracks just dont stick out enough. their first album silent alarm however, has many great songs which are worthy of being singles in their own right (\\"compliments,\\" \\"blue light,\\" \\"so here we are,\\" and \\"plans\\" are my favorites). i know i'm gonna get some flack for this, but just here me out. i have been searching online for unreleased tracks (b-sides) to listen to and i have found some jems. the songs that should have been included on the album are the \\"selfish son,\\" \\"Cain said to Abel,\\" and \\"We are lovers.\\" These are fantastic tracks that were rejected for some reason. check them out and see if you argee with me. Even though i'm a little disappointed about the new album, bloc party still rules! i'm planning to see them in March.
B000M06K5C|3.0|I loved the majority of songs on Silent Alarm (as my only other music review on Amazon would indicate), I saw these guys at Austin City Limits and they put on the best show at the whole festival...so I've been anxiously awaiting the release of this album.  I've also been listening to the two early releases on XM - the Prayer and I Still Remember for one month or so.  I like the Prayer but the other was boring from the start.  Yet, Silent Alarm was one of my favorite albums of that year, so I hoped that other songs on the CD might still provide something.  I listened probably 3x to the whole CD on Myspace when it was posted for the release day (they've since removed most of the album)....the album is average but not great...I continue to like the sound...guitar...Kele's voice...but not the substance of the songs...hooks and bridges...I rarely pay attention to the words on first listens.  For whatever reason, this album as a whole lacks the edge that so many songs on Silent Alarm have - the twists and turns, build up in tension, adrenalin rush that you love on Silent Alarm are strangely absent on Weekend in the City, and instead, most songs are disappointingly predictable.  The bar was set really high with Silent Alarm.  Maybe it's the sophomore curse...Futureheads, Killers...etc.  Or it's possible that working with the Snow Patrol producer might have tamed them and made their sound beyond boringly main stream...which is how I feel about most Snow Patrol songs...rather too long and slow - the album falls well short of the pop brilliance of Silent Alarm.  I think these guys are very talented and unique...so I really believe it is producer error.  Music I am currently listening to:  Shins, Scissor Sisters, Muse, TV on the Radio, Editors.  I disagree with the multiple listen recommendations - this band is face value....Silent Alarm was instant like and had sticking power, and I still hear songs from this album on TV shows and in stores...Bloc Party doesn't have the complexity that Interpol and Death Cab have, which took many listens to love.  Definitely give this a good listen before you buy but I'm pretty dissapointed and won't be buying.

0307346609|5.0|This book is amazing! I truly ripped straight through this book in a matter of days. I'm a former Marine that has traveled the world including two tours in Iraq. The way Brooks tells this story, the tactics, the emotion is really on point. The zombie epidemic was world wide, Brooks seems to tell a story from almost every country. It really hits home just imagining an enemy that can't be intimidated or reasoned with and not easily killed. He really does capture the \\"human factor\\" in war. How regular people handle situations, defend their loved ones, and even lose there minds under the emotional stress of trying to take back an undead world. For a fan of horror and zombie movies this is truly a classic. The book is pretty much eyewitness accounts and interviews from survivors of this tragic war. It could easily be turned into a television series and would be really entertaining. There's really nothing out like it in the television market. The stories do connect and do move forward from the first outbreaks, to a worldwide panic and takeover, to countries atually coming together and fighting back. If you enjoyed \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" like I did, then this really is a book you want to read.

B000J103YI|5.0|Hardcore DG junkies like myself will only be satisfied with the Deluxe edition CD (as well as the EAGERLY AWAITED dvd), but if you're on a budget and only want the main songs, this will do. <br /> <br />The songs themselves are simply wonderful and compliment the excellence of the film. In \\"Fake Your Way to the Top,\\" the DGs nicely compliment Eddie Murphy's James Brownesqe brashness with their background harmonies, they are absolutely angelic in \\"I Want You Baby\\" (the part where they go \\"Got me on my KNEEEESSS\\" will send a shiver up the spine). JH does a nice pseudosixties number in \\"I Love You I Do\\" that you can just see some teeange dancers in a gym circa 1966 doing \\"the jerk\\" to this. <br /> <br />\\"Family,\\" as I have said in another DG review, will probably be sung and played at every family reunion this summer, and Eddie Murphy's \\"Jimmy's Rap\\" is quite a HOWL. Considering Murphy's SNL James Brown takeoffs, it is hard to believe that this was written for another actor in the original stage version.  <br /> <br />\\"Patience\\" is a nice approximation of the Marvin Gaye/Curtis Mayfield type message songs of the 70s, but the lyrics are actually quite timeless and the background choir gives it added dimension. Girl-power anthems are also quite big here, with Beyonce's \\"Listen\\" pushing her usually thin voice to amazing limits, and JH's \\"I Am Changing\\" and-of course-\\"And I Am Telling You....\\" need I say more? <br /> <br />Overall, these songs not only do a good job in representing the eras in which they take place, they are simply good songs PERIOD. This album truly deserved it's #1 spot for several weeks and will hopefully send most of the talentless rumpmistresses who pass as singers today somewhere else to get REAL jobs. Enjoy.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|This 1974 release would prove to be the last studio album from King Crimson until their radical transformation/rebirth in 1981.  Robert Fripp was quoted as saying that King Crimson's dissolution in 1974 occurred at a time when all of the English bands in the (progressive rock) genre should have ceased to exist.  While I do not necessarily agree with everything Mr. Fripp has said regarding progressive rock over the years, Red is indeed a mighty recording upon which to close a very exciting chapter in King Crimson's recorded history.<br /><br />The KC lineup in 1974 is considered by many to be the finest progressive rock lineup to record and included Robert Fripp (electric and acoustic guitars; mellotron); John Wetton (bass and lead vocals); master drummer/percussionist Bill Bruford; along with David Cross (violin); Mel Collins (soprano saxophone); Ian McDonald (alto saxophone); Robin Miller (Oboe); and Marc Charig (cornet).  I think it goes without saying that the guys in KC during the 1973-1974 timeframe were some of the finest musicians around.  The ensemble work is simply out of this world, and Bill Bruford once again demonstrates how to properly use the drum kit.  What is missing from this lineup are softer acoustic textures - this record seemed intent on blasting the VU needle all the way into the \\"Red\\".  This is a good thing by the way.<br /><br />The five pieces on Red range in length from 6'00\\" to 12'18\\".  Musically, the pieces on Red present a thunderous wall of sound that is menacing and at times somewhat violent.  Jagged and frantic guitar parts, heavily distorted bass parts, and wall shaking drumming dominate the album, with comparatively delicate woodwind parts scattered throughout.  The ensemble work is unbelievable and the Bruford/Wetton rhythm section never ceases to amaze.  With respect to the pieces themselves Red, Fallen Angel, and One More Red Nightmare are more or less similar in terms of tempo and heaviness, while Providence is a very experimental piece that would not have been out of place on Starless and Bible Black (1974).  The lengthy Starless however, is another personal favorite (along with Epitaph) and builds slowly, starting off with a very haunting melody played quietly by the band along with layers and layers of mellotron (with string setting) and John Wetton's excellent vocals.  This placid introduction then gradually gives way to the seething fury that was established on the first three pieces and is largely instrumental - Bill Bruford really rips on the closing section of this piece.<br /><br />Well there you have it.  Red is an exceptionally fine example of English progressive rock and is very highly recommended along with [[ASIN:B00065MDRW In the Court of the Crimson King]] (1969); [[ASIN:B00065MDSG Larks Tongues in Aspic - 30th Anniversary Edition Remastered]] (1973); and [[ASIN:B00064WSNM Starless and Bible Black - 30th Anniversary Edition Remastered]].would not have been out of place on Starless and Bible Black (1974).

1400049628|5.0|You can clearly tell that Max Brooks has a very dry sense of humor after reading this book.  I was nearly constantly amused when reading the book and impressed with the consistency and multi-leveled parody of survival guides (try reading parts of the Boy Scout or Army survival guides and you will appreciate Brooks writing style more).  The book does include some useful planning tips for worse case scenarios such a massive earthquake or god forbid a nuclear weapon detonation.   <br /> <br />If you enjoy horror stories especially zombie stories, you will have a very enjoyable time and learn a bit about survival planning at the same time. <br /> <br />A job very well done, Max! <br />
B000M4RG4C|5.0|Academy Award-winning director Clint Easwood and Steven Spielberg have combined their talents to produce a masterpiece of a film about one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific war: Iwo Jima.  Iwo Jima was important strategically for the United States because of its close proximity to Japan, being only 600 miles from Tokyo.  Iwo Jima was to be used as an advanced fighter base as well as an emergency landing field for crippled B-29 bombers returning from bombing Japan.  But first, the island had to be taken. <br /> <br />Ryan Phillippe stars as Navy corpsman John \\"Doc\\" Bradley.  He, along with Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), Ira Hayes (Adam Beach), Mike Strank (Barry Pepper), Harlan Block (Benjamin Walker), and Franklin Sousley (Joseph Cross) would soon become famous for appearing in the most recgonizable photograph ever taken; Joe Rosenthal's famous shot of the second flag raising over Iwo Jima.   <br /> <br />Eastwood does a marvelous job of describing the battle through the eyes of Bradley.  The battle scenes are extremely realistic and the description of the lives of the surviving flag-raisers is told in a poignant yet factual manner.  Mike Strank, Harlon Block, and Franklin Sousley were eventually killed later in the battle, leaving Bradley, Hayes, and Gagnon as survivors.  They were immediately pulled off the island and sent back to the United States to appear in bond rallies across the country. <br /> <br />Hayes didn't want to leave the island, instead preferring to remain with his fellow Marines.  He battled alcohol while constantly dealing with being called a hero.  He felt that the real heroes died in battle, and he was merely a survivor.  His battles with alcohol eventually led to him being shipped back to combat. He battled alcoholism for the rest of his life while landing in and out of jail.  He died of exposure to the outside elements. <br /> <br />Gagnon loved the spotlight and all of the fame and attention.  He constantly rubbed shoulders with politicians and businessmen.  He was promised numerous jobs along the way, but none ever materialized.  He made a living as a janitor. <br /> <br />Bradley was somewhat in the middle of the two extremes set by Hayes and Gagnon.  He seemed to like the attention, but he as well realized that the true heroes died in battle.  He often played peacemaker between Gagnon and Hayes, and he helped Hayes through his battles with alcohol.  He returned home after the war, married his girlfriend, and purchased a funeral home, where he made his living. <br /> <br />This is one of the best war movies I've seen.  The story is excellent, and Eastwood does a magnificent job of intertwining the battle sequences with the story of the surviving flag-raisers and the bond tour.  Several times during the movie, there is a flashback to the combat on Iwo Jima, and these flashbacks help the viewer understand what the characters are thinking.  The acting, especially by Jesse Bradford, Ryan Phillippe, Adam Beach, and Barry Pepper is first-rate. <br /> <br />I give this fine movie my highest recommendation.  Uncommon valor was a common virtue among the Marines and sailors on Iwo Jima, and this movie definitely shows that aspect.  Watch and see how six men who, in their innocence, changed the world forever.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I viewed the recent BBC production of Jane Eyre. Then I heard about another well reviewed series North and South. I read Elizabeth Gaskell's noveland purchased and viewed the DVD of the 2004 BBC production. It's a wonderful story of love, reminiscent of Darcy and Elizabeth from Austen's Pride and Prejudice, in a backdrop of the changes being wrought by the Industrial Revolution. The BBC production stays mostly faithful to the overall themes of the novel, although it does take a major leap of dramatic license at the end. What makes this work so interesting is instead of the closed world of landed gentry portrayed in Jane Austen's work or the gothic psychological inwardness of Charlotte Bronte, Gaskell through her characters (especially the interaction between the Hales and Thorntons) explores how the Industrial Revolution was overturning the last remnants of the old feudal/aristocratic order -- to be replaced by commerce and money. At first, Mrs. Hale and Miss Margaret Hale look down on the mill-owning Thorntons because they are engaged in trade, while Mr. Hale is an educated ex-clergyman of the Church of England. The females in the Thornton family look down on the Hales because they are relatively poor while they have achieved great financial success in textile manufacturing. The BBC series reinforces this societal tension when Mr. Thornton meets some relations of Margaret's -- who live in London -- at the Great Exhibition (no such scene took place in the novel), and one of them in a condescending tone mentions his brother wants to \\"dabble\\" in the cotton trade; Mr. Thornton as his usual brooding self responds, to paraphrase, that 'he does not dabble.' Also, as a Yank I was captivated by the different accents of the southern Hales versus the northern Thorntons. On top of this conflict between the old and new elite, labor strife is personified by union leader Nicholas Higgins, who organizes a strike against the cotton mills -- including Mr. Thornton's, with the hope of improving the lives of downtrodden mill workers.    The production value of this mini-series is tremendous. In scenes in the Hales' old residence of Helstone one sees an idyllic rural setting where the sun always shines. In contrast, in the industrial city of Milton (Manchester) it's always gray, and I do not remember ever seeing the sun come out. The scene where Miss. Hale meets Mr. Thornton for the first time is spectacular, another departure from the novel, as she is shocked to see the workings of a cotton mill as particulates of cotton float around her as if it is snowing. The overall feel of the mini-series is rather grim, appropriate for an industrial setting, with sorrowful music dominating the score.    There are many great acting performances. Among them is Richard Armitage as John Thornton. He fits Gaskell's portrayal of the self-made man who underneath his proud, brooding exterior has inner self-doubt about his worth because he is not a gentleman based on Margaret's standards. His mother Hannah Hale played by Sinead Cusack steals the scenes she's in. One can call her the original Iron Lady but underneath a hard as nails exterior is a mother devoted and proud of what her son has achieved. One sees a beautiful portrayal of a mother's love for her son when she consoles him over Miss. Hale's rejection of his proposal of marriage. Of course, immediately after that she growls her indignant hate of Miss. Hale for rejecting her son. Brendan Coyle is excellent as the union leader Nicholas Higgins who tries to get what he feels are fair wages for his workers. Despite being on opposites side of, to use Marxian terminology, the bourgeoisie/proletariat divide he and Mr. Thornton discover they are more alike than they are at first willing to admit. Finally, Tim Pigott-Smith plays the quiet, dignified Mr. Hale who is burdened by what he has done to his family in leaving the Church of England over a matter of conscience.    Besides these factors what really stands outis how the series presents both sides of the conflict between workers and capitalists. In one scene, we see the workers under Higgins' leadership discuss how their wages were cut five years ago, and how they want their old wages restored just to keep up with the increasing prices of food and other necessities -- while in another scene Mr. Thornton and his mother discuss their problems in competing against the flood of textile imports from America. Viewing this series was a nice antedote to having to watch that horrid Norma Rae in college.    Finally, in an era in which businessmen are portrayed as evil in most Hollywood movies, this series presents a compelling protagonist in Mr. Thornton the capitalist. We really see his mind at work when his hosts a supper with the other mill owners and invites Mr. Hale to join them. (I find myself wishing to be in the company of these men who look like they are having a good time drinking, smoking and talking business than in some stuffy drawing room discussing polite topics.)  They are discussing whether to install fans at the mills to lessen the \\"fluff\\" in the air. Mr. Hale argues it's a Christian thing to do. But Mr. Thornton who has installed the fans argues morality has no role to play. He installed the fans because it keeps the workers healthy and more productive, justifying the investment in the fans. One can see the torch passing from the spiritual world to one of impersonal economic calculation. I must admit my blood was roused by Mr. Thornton's clear economic rationale and how the power of market forces in this case benefits both workers and owners. I have not seen a more positive portrayal of a businessman in quite some time. Yes, he does soften around the edges as the story progresses but he does not renounce who he is.

B000J10ERO|3.0|This movie seems to have inspired some lively discussion on the web, but it's the DVD itself that warrants some comment. I bought this DVD as reference material for an architectural project (see below), and was surprised to see that the transfer quality was comparatively ordinary. Not that it's poor, but I just expected better when (a) it was shot using the latest and greatest high-definition digital cameras, and (b) so many lower-profile movies have much more beautifully rich and crisp DVD transfers. It's possible that it has suffered in the high-def to standard-def conversion, but I can't help but feel that it was somewhat deliberate on the part of the studios, so that the HD-DVD/Blu-Ray editions would look that much better in a side-by-side comparison with the DVD. <br /> <br />On the positive side, after seeing this movie at the cinema, I decided to buy the DVD to assist with the design of an art deco/streamline moderne-style home theatre. The set designers have done a great job of reproducing these architectural styles, and my particular interest was the interior design of 'The Gertrude' (Lex Luthor's luxury vessel), which captures the 'streamline' styling especially well. <br /> <br />It was also fun to see some familiar locations in my home town of Sydney!

B00005NOOH|5.0|I just bought this extremely interesting war documentary series which once appeared nightly on television in Canada. It is perhaps the most definite work concerning the Second World War as aggressively started by Nazi Germany (Adolf Hitler), Facist Italy (Mussolinni)and Barbaric, Imperial Japan (Hideki Tojo & demised emperor Hirohito). The Second World War generated by these evil axis of aggressive powers, thinking that together they would dominate the world and make all people their slaves, came to a tragic end. Their diabolic deeds like Adolf Hitler gassing of the six million European Jews, then the torture, rape and summarily execution of some 300,000 Chinese civilians by the barbaric Japanese soldiers led by their demented general named Matusi are some of the most barbaric and heinous crimes against humanity in both Europe and East Asia, particularly China. Let's hope that this highly educational series will serve to teach and inform that there nothing to be gained  by armed aggression and killing of massive innocent and unarmed people. It was the decisive Normandy Landing in France which led to the ultimate destruction of Adolf Hitler and his racist gang. Also, the two American atomic bombs over Nagasaki and Hiroshima in \\"bungsai\\" Imperial Japan which led to the final hanging of its war criminals and the compelling suing for unconditional peace and surrender. Aggressive war should be outlawed on our Planet forever more. So go for the series if you're inclined to learn the definitive lessons of war history as indicated by THE WORLD AT WAR. Thanks.
0553573403|5.0|A friend and colleague of mine recommended this book to me a couple of years ago. I was looking for an engaging fantasy book and this did not dissapoint. Although this book has its share of positives and negatives, the positives greatly outweigh the negatives.<br /><br />First, the storyline. The way in which this book is written is very engaging and well-paced. You really feel connected to the characters; I found myself getting emotionally involved with this book several times. It obviously takes place in fantasy world, where kings and lords rule the land. Although the first book doesn't actually show dragons and other monsters, it does mention it a lot. So my guess is all hell is going to break loose in the upcoming books.<br /><br />This book quite simply is a page turner. Once you understand the plot it becomes very hard to put down the book. Each chapter of the book takes a different characters point of view. This makes it easier to keep track of all the sub-plots that are going on. At the books end I went right out to Borders and bought Book II. If you like fantasy/sci-fi, you will fall in love with A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />As for the negatives, there are a few. First (and the most glaring), it that there are way too many characters to keep track of. Sure the author gives you a breakdown of each family in the appendix of the book, but while reading it I often became confused of who is who. However, as long as you keep track of the main characters the pages will fly by.<br /><br />All in all, I was very satisfied with this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy novels.
B000M06K5C|5.0|Bloc Party's job since the release of their incredible first album, 'Silent Alarm' has been to try and figure out ways to top that sound.  What 'Silent Alarm' delivered was something different; an album that captured all types of emotions from brutal lows to euphoric happiness. <br /> <br />'Weekend in the City', the follow up to 'Silent Alarm', is a musical experience that tries to mimic what it feels like to visit the city (any city).  The album starts off slow, making you feel scared and alone lead singer Kele Okereke sings in a high-pitched voice that sounds full of despondency.  Within a minute though, as if arriving to the scene of a party of friends after a lonely ride, the track picks up and becomes fast paced with a beat remniscent of Bloc Party's more technoesque songs. <br /> <br />The album keeps the pace through the next two tracks with catchy and seriously epic sounding choruses that make you want to stand up and sing/dance along with them.  The fourth track; the online hit 'The Prayer'  shines out of the starter tracks with a seeminly tribal sound that quickly builds into an all out free-for-all of techno beats and voice effects.  'Uniform' reflects the band's take on how fake younger people are and how they try to act how the media tells them and does a splendid job of conveying this in a slower buildup to what ends in a 'break the mold' smash of drums and guitars. <br /> <br />'Where is Home?' is a beautiful and effective take on the war; the way the media seems to barrage us with sad-stories and even simpler the multitudes of tragedy our generation faces.  The song is a powerful reminder that our day and age faces many hardships to come and that we need to band together as people to work through it.  'Kreuzberg' is one of the few lighter songs on the cd and is a welcome break from the otherwise hecticness of city life.  'I Still Remember' is the single off the cd and is obviously a bit more instantly-accessable to the radio friendly crowd but is still nonetheless a great song with a catchy chorus and solid sounds. <br /> <br />'Sunday' and 'SRXT' provide a perfect soundtrack to reflections of a weekend, which we all have had, once it ends.  In 'Sunday' Kele reflects on the night before and how he still cares for her.   <br /> <br /> <br />In the finale 'SRXT' the song starts off alone, much like 'Songs for Clay'; still remembering the good times he had from not only the night before but the entire weekend.  It all builds up to a final powerful, very epic sounding musical barrage.  Senses reel as all singing stops and the band really unleashes what they have onto the listener.  Much like the weekend, this ends all too soon and you are left wanting more.  Much like Kele though, you'll be left remembering it forever.

1582882339|5.0|Fast paced. I couldn't put I Am Legend down. Hell House is my favorite haunted house story. It is not appropriate for young adults, or children. Both stories far outshine the movies based on them, and the movies are great for that era.

B0007TKH66|1.0|To me, Star Trek has always been about the future.  What made The \\"Next Generation\\" wildly successfull was the fact that it takes place farther in the future than the original series. You get to see the progress that the Federation has made in regards to technology and its relationships to other races.  So why did they decide to make a prequel? Talk about boring and redundant.  The producers had a chance to make something that could have pulled in another generation of viewers and completely blew it.  Now the franchise is basically dead in the water.   The actors try their best but the characters are static and uninteresting. The writers try to take some half-hearted chances in the final two seasons but by then it is too late.  I grew up watching Star Trek and love the concept but its old and stale.  I think that the franchise owners need to watch shows such as Buffy, Battlestar Galactica and Farscape. Maybe then, they will get a clue and take some risks with the storytelling and the direction of the franchise.
B000065VB0|5.0|I can't speak highly enough of this album.  This is his masterpiece.  Here Gabriel really defines himself as a solo artist. The whole album is great start to finish.<br /><br />It's perhaps difficult to appreciate 27 years later how groundbreaking and just plain weird this album sounded in 1980.  The comparison with Bowie's Berlin albums is somewhat valid, but this album goes places that are very different.  It was a mind-blower for me back then.  The gated drum sound of \\"Intruder\\" became clich&eacute; later, but nobody had ever done that before.  The drums are also played without cymbals, which contributes to the tense, claustrophobic feel of much of it.  The guitars and background vocals (`Not One Of Us\\", for instance) are given treatments which were novel and also heighten the mood.  I don't mean to say that the album all sounds the same - it certainly doesn't -but there is a flow to it.  The cover describres the previaling mood. Even \\"Games Without Frontiers\\", with its silly lyrics and whistling, has unmistakeable dark undertones.  Which isn't to say this album is downer by any means.  It's a great album, just don't expect \\"Big Time\\" or anything like that!<br /><br />Lyrics have always been one of Gabriel's distinctive strong points, and here he is in top form.  \\"Intruder\\" and \\"No Self Control\\" are downright spooky. \\"Lead a Normal Life\\" is a minimalist musical haiku which leaves you scratching your head about it's meaning.  \\"Family Snapshot\\" is wild stuff!  It starts out innocently enough, almost reminiscent of a Bruce Springsteen story song, but then takes are very sinister turn.  It gets in the head of a political assassin who targets his victim just to make his mark on the world:<br /><br />\\"All you people in TV land<br />I will wake up your empty shells<br />Peak-time viewing blown in a flash<br />As I burn into your memory cells<br />'Cos I'm alive\\"<br /><br />\\"Biko\\" has of course become anthemic by now.  It's the first song (in western pop music, anyway) that addresses apartheid, to my knowledge, and the first rock song to incorporate South African harmonies.<br /><br />If all you know about Peter Gabriel are his two commercial albums \\"So\\" and \\"Us\\", please listen to his other material with an open mind.  His first 4 solo albums and \\"Up\\" are all great, but this is his best.t rock song to incorporate South African harmonies.

B000006OBQ|5.0|This album is a perfect example of what Frank Sinatra did better than anyone else in his day.  His voice on this album is excellent, his personality in front of an audience is outstanding.  The album will keep people laughing and singing all the way through.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This second offering from creator David Downes provides for another beautiful and ethereal celtic experience.  The shear grandeur of Slane Castle, Ireland as a background for the lovely ladies of Celtic Woman provides for an exciting display of sight and sound.  Newcomer Hayley Westenra affords a fresh face and sonancy complementing Chloe, Orla, Meav, and my personal favorite Lisa Kelly.  Though not present, I also count once part timer Dierdre Shannon as she subbed for Meav in the live performance I was fortunate to see in 2005.<br /><br />Now, several people have metioned that in this performance like Celtic Woman v.1, the girls lip synced all the songs.  I noticed towards the end of this DVD it seemed more apparent than ever.  Logistics in mind, this  is NOT an unusual tactic with such a large scale interpretation involving so many singers and musicians.  Same goes in the making of a movie musical where all singing is lip synced.<br /><br />So relax, overlook whatever flaws, if any, and just enjoy the Celtic Woman experience!
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|This is very innovative science fiction. It is just so intriguing not only in its central theme but as a very interesting story filled with many fascinating character complexities and interactions. Once you start watching this movie you cannot turn away from it. Once you see it scenes keep coming back to you for several days. It is that engrossing. I wanted to watch it again the next day. It is so different and appealing. I wish this DVD was in widescreen but honestly the film is so good that you just look beyond that. There is a certain intimacy about this film that I can't seem to describe but it just captures you.
B00005JNS0|3.0|After all the hype I expected Cars to be a great movie.  I guess they had a good marketing plan!  The graphics were great, but the story was not.  Several things weren't good for my 3-year-old either, but I guess that's what I have come to expect form G movies anymore.  The H-word is used several times and other \\"adult\\" innuendos that I think are totally unnecessary.  If I have to be entertained for the hour and a half long movie to go see it with my child I don't think my motive is right.  Let's make children's movies for the children, and when we need entertainment we can watch our own movies!
0743454529|1.0|I picked up this book intrigued by the idea of the novel, and less so by the author.  (I read her Tenth Circle novel and it rang all too hollow for me. <br /> <br />The writing is not that great.  I'm never a fan of characters swooping in with the perfect deep thought, which happens with every character far too often as far as I'm concerned.  I also found the mother Sara to be obnoxious, and the author's attempt to add sympathy to her character was inept and hackneyed at best. <br /> <br />The ending, however, that took the cake.  After taking us through the whole book fighting over Anna's right to make this decision, that decision ultimately doesn't matter because of the ending, which is hackneyed and cliche and hideously awful.  There are a million ways this story could have ended that were true to the feel and spirit of this book.  Show us SOMETHING other than this melodramatic Hollywood ending. <br /> <br />In the book in the question and answer section, the author notes that even her 12 year old son wouldn't speak to her after reading the horribly hackneyed ending that she threw together.  Don't waste your time either.
B000JLTRKE|4.0|Oliver Stone's decision to tell his 9/11 story via two trapped Port Authority officers is inspired. The focus on two trapped men allows him to explore the themes of how survival can depend on love of family and duty to a stranger in dire trouble.<br /><br />That is not to say that this film is a picnic to watch. The scenes of the officers trapped are as dark and claustrophobic and dramatically challenging as can be imagined. The background noises of a moaning, treacherous pile of distressed steel, cement, pipes and building guts are quietly frightening as the two helpless men talk to try to avoid unconsciousness and death.<br /><br />I nearly said to my husband, \\"This is too much to watch\\" at several points.<br /><br />The fortitude to continue was rewarded as the story of Staff Sergeant Dave Karns, U.S. Marines retired, began to become important.  An accountant in Connecticut on the day of Sept. 11, he leaves work, goes to church to pray, gets a buzz cut at a barber, drives to ground zero dressed in camou gear.<br /><br />He glances around and walks past the timid, officious bureaucrats shutting down rescue operations for the night, with potentially tragic consequences for the pitiful handful of survivors (20 all told) trapped in the rubble.<br /><br />Karns and began an independent search for survivors with another freelancer, Jason Thomas.  Karns says to Thomas (I paraphrase from memory),  \\"Don't stop, if anyone says to stop, you didn't hear them.\\" He makes an executive decision, which proves correct, that time is of the essence, and that if the freelancers can take flashlights to the top of the rubble and prowl silently, listening for signs of life, they may find survivors.<br /><br />Karns' can-do spirit is quite inspiring. \\"You sir are my mission,\\" he tells the trapped officers, found as one grabs a squealing pipe to try to catch a drop of dripping water, creating enough noise to alert the rescuers to life below in the horrible rubble. Karns is an everyday hero (he later signed on for two tours of Iraq) and the quiet center of this powerful story.<br /><br />Kudos to Oliver Stone. Who knew the ultimate conspiracy theorist could put his tendencies aside and follow his better angel, his talent for current events, so strongly?everyday hero (he later signed on for two tours of Iraq) and the quiet center of this powerful story. <br /> <br />Kudos to Oliver Stone.

B000002ULO|5.0|Flaming Pie is a fascinating listen for those that are interested in McCartney as a singer, songwriter and personality.  Paul's music has always given the listener some insight into his life, but this one seems to do that in a big way.  Recorded at a time when the Beatles Anthology was wrapping up and Linda was losing her courageous battle with cancer, the songs have a nostalgic feel both musically and lyrically.  Old friendships are renewed with collaborations with Steve Miller and Jeff Lynne including performances by Linda and James McCartney. I originally bought the CD having only heard the title track from his live performance at St. Petersburg, Russia, which was a bit more tame in studio form than in its live hard rocking version.  \\"Souvenir\\" is another great tune that is reminiscent of his late work with the Beatles.  \\"Little Willow\\" is a poignant ballad written to deal with the grief of Ringo's wife's passing.  \\"Calico Skies\\" is another classic McCartney tune that is as poetic as it is melodic.  The Ringo Starr collaboration \\"Really Love You\\" is a classic driving bluesy rocker.  Similarly, the Steve Miller duet, \\"Used to be Bad\\" has a blues rock edge.  \\"Somedays\\" is introspective and a poignant reflection of Paul's mood subsequent to the Anthology sessions.  To me, this collection of songs seems to have two personalities: 1) An old-school rocker getting back to his roots and 2) A wistful self-examination of life experiences.  Either way, it is a worthwhile purchase and a must for those who relish the work of Sir Paul.

B00003CXA2|5.0|My best friend introduced the film to me. Wherever you are in the world, I miss watching movies with you. Actually, I was not interested in this moive at all when I watched at the first time. Fortunately, I watched it again as my friend kept telling me that it was a great movie. Then, I watched it more than 3 times. Everytime I watch, I cry and laugh at Forrest's Character. I got to like Tom Hanks at that time. I think Forrest's character is well reflected to Tom Hank's own character as I  observe his role in other films.     I admire him because  he is true to his nation, his friends, and his family and himself.  He keeps every promise when he makes one. For example, he promised his friend that both of them would operate a Shrimp company after the Vietnam War ended. Unfortunately, his friend died in the war. Nevetheless,he went to tell his friend's family that he would set up a Shrimp company as he had promised.

B000K7VHQE|2.0|If you could find a metaphor for my emotional response to \\"Little Miss Sunshine,\\" it would be that of a strong wave building in height, crashing on the beach, and then receding far down the sand. In other words, the film is enjoyable to watch, until the ending, and becomes less and less enjoyable the more you think about it after it ends.<br /><br />This film started strong with the funny family and the touching bond between Olive and her brother Dwayne. All was fine on their road trip to the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" pageant in California until ** SPOILER ALERT ** the final dance number by Olive, which was a straight ripoff of Napolean Dynamite -- social loser beset by family problems redeemed by confident funky dancing.<br /><br />Also, the more a viewer contemplates how Olive learned stripper-style dancing from her grandfather, whom she spends way too much time with on her own, the greater the *ick* quotient. ** END SPOILER ALERT **<br /><br />Much as Vietnam vets may suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" may create \\"post-viewing downward rating syndrome.\\" A more creative and less gaggy ending might have made \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" more of a keeper.
630463949X|5.0|My wife & I first had the opportunity to view this DVD at a party several years ago but did not know the title. The host payed this DVD in the background and it was so incredible that my wife and I gravitated to the family room where it was playing. I had no idea at the time that dvd's of concerts were even available so this was a real surprise to actually see them up close at their very best! Our memories of this dvd were so strong that we recently searched and found it available on Amazon.com. <br /> <br /> We have always loved the music of Fleetwood Mac but had never had an opportunity to see them in concert-well this is even better. The photography is really well done so you really see the musicians playing their instruments (up close) as their part in the song comes up. Great close ups so you really can get into the concert. The pinnacle of the concert is when the USC marching band comes onto the stage as Tusk begins to play...WOW!!! You can't image how good it sounds! <br /> <br />Even after watching the dvd several times it is still very enjoyable to play as we clean the house or cook. Not only is this the best of Fleetwood Mac but you can watch their amazing talant be shared with some lucky college band members who, I am sure, had the experience of a lifetime! This is our favorite concert DVD. I know you will enjoy it if you like Fleetwood Mac at all.
0452287588|5.0|As many other reviewers have noted, there is little in this book that is substantially different to what Eckhart wrote in his other books. They also said the same thing when he published \\"Practising the Power of Now\\", and \\"Stillness Speaks\\", but given that the message being delivered is supposedly the eternal and absolute truth, how could there be anything new?    It seems to me that with each subsequent publication Eckhardt is clarifying his message. With practice he is becoming a better writer and a better teacher. If you have read or listened to any of his previous works and feel that you've \\"got it\\" there is probably no point in buying this one. But if you are still in the process of learning how to attain, maintain, or deepen your sense of presence, you might find this a worthy addition to your library.    One of the other complaints that many negative reviewers have is that Eckhart is recycling or repackaging some of the wisdom of others. Is that a bad thing? Don't we all build upon the knowledge of others as well as that derived from personal experience? I don't think Eckhart has ever claimed to be the only wise man that has ever lived. And I do believe he is a wise man.  He is one amongst many who have taken the time and effort to point the way towards what may be a better way of living,     I knew Eckhart many years ago as a young boy when he played on our football team in Wiesbaden, and even then he was an unusual fellow. He was quite a good athlete, but sometimes he was so totally absorbed in something other than the game that when the ball came towards him he would ignore it as completely as he did our exhortations to chase it. He never cared if we won or lost, and was more interested in playing practical jokes on his teammates in the locker room than in what happened on the playing field. One time we were playing in a field near a forest when one of the boys kicked the ball into the trees. Eckhart surprised us by running in after it, but what was even more surprising (or maybe not) was that he didn't come out again. Two other boys went in a few minutes later and found the ball, but Eckhart had disappeared.    I was surprised when I discovered that \\"Dopey,\\" as we called him back then, was the same Eckhart Tolle who had written \\"The Power of Now,\\" and in saying that I don't mean to disparage him. It's just that way back then he didn't seem special in any way at all, other than in his ability not to score or even care whenever we needed a goal.     Since then I have read all of his books and think they are wonderful, but there is one thing I don't understand. Why does Eckhart consider it important for the new consciousness or awareness to arise? He says that this must happen for the good of the planet, but the general message in his books is one of non-attachment and non-judgement, and unless I have got it wrong this sentiment of wanting to save humanity from its own folly seems to indicate both attachment and judgement. I suspect that most people would experience greater peace in their lives, and that the world would be a happier place if more of us were able to live in the now, but given that we will all die sooner or later, and it's likely that the whole species will eventually disappear, well before the earth is burnt to a crisp by our dying star in a couple of billion years time, what difference does it make?    Each of us, every butterfly, rock, raindrop, and super cluster of galaxies is an energy field, which is part of a larger energy field known to us as the universe which may well be part of another energy field and so on. We are all part of a Cosmos in which things appear to come and go. If the universe is the creation of God, or if the universe is God, what difference does anything make to anything, as it's all God?    Apart from that minor quibble, I believe that Eckhart has done a great service to humanity in writing these books. You don't have to agree with everything he says to derive some benefit from reading them. In my case they have helped in my quest to lead a peaceful life.     Well done Eckhart!
0142002038|4.0|Given what I felt was a weak Bond movie, I was somewhat skeptical about the value of this particular Bond book.  But the reason the movie was weak -- a franchise which had not yet hit its stride -- is not true of the book.  Fleming clearly was in good command of the actions of his hero in his sixth Bond adventure.  The unusual factor in this particular volume is that as Bond's featured nemesis becomes more cartoonish, his ultimate aspirations are actually quite a bit tamer than previous world dominators.  Dr. No simply wants to help the Soviets hinder the American rocketry program from his hidden outpost in the Caribbean.  Hell, even bin Laden has more on his mind than this guy.  But it's a story well-told, with an excruciating torture scene that Bond survives.  Why was Bond allowed the escapable torture tunnel when his Jamaican predecessor ended up with a swift and logical bullet to the head?  Yes, well, that's why that agent, Strangways, does NOT have a series focused on his adventures.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|After the scathing metal powerhouse that was \\"Train Of Thought\\" Dream Theater moves back into more familiar terrain with \\"Octoavarium\\".  More overtly proggy, with individual songs, and no apparent concept, the album harks back to many of the band's early prog influences in style and substance.  This is a much quieter album for the most part than \\"Train Of Thought\\".   The album opens with John Myung's bass propelling \\"The Root Of All Evil\\" which is the third part of a trilogy of songs spread out over the last few albums.  \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" is a nice ballad, and \\"These Walls\\" is another cool song.  The 4th track \\"I Walk Besides You\\" sounds like a deliberate attempt at a single.  The song would very easily fit on a U2 album with guitar and vocals practically imitating the patented U2 style and sound.  \\"Panic Attack\\" is a scorching instrumental burner that will please those craving a spitfire attack of technical wizardry.  \\"Never Enough\\" is another decent track.  It is followed by \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" which in my opinion is one of the best songs about September 11th ever written.  The album closes with the 24 minute title track recorded complete with full symphony orchestra.  This is a sprawling piece that is quite different from anything Dream Theater has done.  Much less metal oriented than much of their work, the song could very easily have been recorded by Yes or any number of classic era progressive rock fans.  If there is such a thing as \\"roots prog\\" this is it.  Overall this is another strong studio effort from Dream Theater.  The band is never afraid to try different things, and this album is a complete left turn from the previous one.
6305657947|2.0|This remake of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR just seems like a work in futility. Futility? Yes. Why remake this film in such a manner? There is no style over substance as in the original. The only style present was rather pretentious. One thing immediately that I disliked and it ran throughout the film was Bill Conti's intrusive score. But the real weakness her is the weakness of the Thomas Crown character. The scriptwriters have once more let Pierce Brosnan down. He really could have saved this film if the powers that be had let him. Brosnan's Crown has no direction, no purpose and ultimately no drive. He is a weak hero or anti-hero and maybe that's the problem. 1968's Thomas Crown was the ultimate anti-hero. Perhaps the scriptwriters here are only being politically correct. That is their regret and our loss. The only saving grace in this film is Denis Leary's character and performance. Perhaps he is our anti-hero.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I first saw \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" in a movie theater and was impressed with how original and funny it was; even wacky at times.  Watching this DVD at home, I was struck with how inexpressibly sad it is as well.  And isn't that the essence of Life itself?  That in the depths of despair we can find reasons to laugh, and in our supreme happiness we suddenly find ourselves on the verge of tears.  This simple little film, beautifully directed and written, says more about the human condition and our responsibilities to one another as people than do more \\"important\\" films like \\"Babel\\" and \\"Children of Men\\" and \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" combined.  (And they're all good films, by the way.) \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" will sneak up on and stick with you; and I bet that how you feel about the film will change on repeat viewings, depending on your mood.  It's profound without being pretentious, superbly performed, and very, very winning. I think it's a classic, and the best picture of 2006, whether it wins the Oscar or not.
0618680004|4.0|The God Delusion is the first book that I've read by Richard Dawkins and I enjoyed it very much. A few reviewers have complained about the depth that the book goes into, however I like to see the facts, so I found the detailed information refreshing. Also refreshing was Dawkins well-formed arguments. The writing actually reminded me of my college class in logic and the steps needed to make a sound argument.<br /><br />It seems that Dawkins has perhaps even less patience with the agnostic fence-sitters than with all out fundamentalists. I think he sees agnostics as having the tools to come to the same conclusions as he has, but without the guts to take the full plunge into atheism. I must say I was quite amused by some of the sprinkled-in quotes by our country's founders and other influential people that had a distinctly atheistic tone or message.<br /><br />I agree that the three Abrahamitic religions seem to be breeding grounds for intolerance. It is for this precise point that I think Dawkins would make an even greater impact in contrast by toning down the jabs a bit. Regardless of whether they should or shouldn't be, faith and reason do inhabit different realms, and therefore neither can fully explain away the other.<br /><br />True, Dawkins is mainly preaching to the choir, but I wish more people of faith would at least be confident enough in their faith to explore the many valid points that Dawkins has painstakingly put forth in The God Delusion. If you have an open mind, I highly recommend this book. If you don't have an open mind, you should save your money.
B000002GVO|5.0|Anyone that grew up in the 70's can't help, but have heard just about every track on this disc.  With the addition of Joe Walsh to the lineup The Eagles were at the top of their game with this one, and it is considered by many to be one of the classic albums of the 70's.  The band took on a heavier sound moving away from the more country rock roots of their earlier albums.  Several huge hits came from this one.  The title track with it's distinctive twin guitar solo at the end.  \\"New Kid In Town\\" one of the best \\"my ex girl is seeing someone else\\" songs ever written.  \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\" which pretty much describes the decadent lifestyle of southern California in the late 70's, and the life the band ws living at the time.  \\"Wasted Time\\" a Don Henley penned track about an ex-girlfriend.  The second half of the album did not get the airplay, but the songs are just as good.  \\"Victim Of Love\\" sung by Henley starts things out.  Joe Walsh's \\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\" is a surprisingly subtle tune from Joe Walsh.  Randy Meisner's \\"Try And Love Again\\" with simply gorgeous vocals would prove to be his last with the band.  The album concludes with what to me is the best thing the Eagles ever created \\"The Last Resort\\"  This mini epic, written by Don Henley covers the history of California and how it came to be what it is (or was at the time) all in less than 8 minutes.  The lyrics are outstanding on this one, some of Henley's best, and it still has a poignant message to tell 30 years later.  Some fans of the band's older material looked at this album as a sell out of sorts, but to my ears this was their high water mark.

0312995423|1.0|...and she could probably break the code faster too! <br /> <br />Don't waste your time on Digital Fortress (unless you completely don't understand computers -- then you might think it's plausible)! <br /> <br />I will say the book is sort of entertaining.  I did read it to the end just to see exactly how it turned out.  However, with that said, I will also say I had the whole thing correctly figured out before I hit even the half way point in the book.  It was very predictable. <br /> <br />For starters, Dan Brown seems to have a habit of making the \\"innocent little old lady\\" of each story into the \\"most deceitful demon\\" of the book so you need only look for the most banal of characters, and that's your culprit! <br /> <br />What really destroys this plot though is how it's technologically porous!  This book couldn't hold water in a hurricane! <br /> <br />First, there's a professional hit man who knocks off people left and right, but when it really matters, he can't hit a slow moving target from twenty feet on an airport tarmack where there's no place to hide. <br /> <br />Second, there's a computer that can brute-force crack codes because they added a whole boat load of processors to it.  Unfortunately, Brown overlooked simple laws of physics like the one we're approaching in computing right now.  No matter how many processors you put into a computer, you still can't make any one of those processors move faster than it's present physical limitations.  It's like taking one bicycle that goes 12 miles per hour and saying if we string enough bicycles together, we can make them all go 1000 miles per hour together -- it won't happen. <br /> <br />Then there's the notion that the government can read anything it wants, and it's impossible to create anything our government can't break so why even try. <br /> <br />Finally, there are a bunch of mathematically brilliant people who take ten pages to figure out basic mathematical clues like \\"prime\\" and \\"difference\\" (it'll take you only to the end of the sentence to have the answer even if you don't know math). <br /> <br />Yeah, there's still a lot more that's wrong in here, but those were the biggies!  Like I said, save your time (and your money)!  You'll be happy you did!
0060752610|5.0|This classic book on investing belongs on the bookshelf of every investor. The principles that Benjamin Graham outlines are the very precepts that guided such great investors as Warren Buffett, and such mutual fund innovators as John Bogle, the noted Vanguard Group founder, who wrote this edition's foreword. First published in 1949, the text shows a few signs of age, most notably in its discussion of interest rates, investment vehicles such as savings bonds and other time-sensitive subjects. However, those are minor issues. When Benjamin Graham writes about categories of investors, approaches to security analysis, the proper disposition investors should have toward market moves, and other fundamental investment subjects, his advice is timeless. We highly recommend this seminal book.
0553381407|5.0|I thought the book was very well written, and very helpful.  I would recommend it to anyone who is having a difficult relationship with a parent or parents.  It lets you know you are not alone and that it is possible to break an unheathly cycle of behavior.
B000002UC5|5.0|If you can forget for a minute about that group \\"The Beatles\\" and listen to this record with an open mind, it is a really good record and was inspired by the late 60's Beach Boys records that were recorded at home also, like this one is.  <br />1. Lovely Linda - you can actually hear the studio door opening   <br />2. That Would Be Something - covered later by the Grateful Dead!   <br />3. Valentine Day - instrumental  <br />4.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|...the fact that we cant really do anything to help the globe. If we do stop using fossil fuels and everything that causes global warming, it'd take up to 30 years for the ozone to be ok again. But your really gonna get Everyone to pay for less harmful household items and vehicles? This film is focused on the middle and upper class. What about the lower class? What if a family cant afford this and that? <br /> <br />Al Gore leaves this and many other problems out of the film, however, it's pretty well done and convincing.  <br /> <br />But are we REALLY the cause of this planet's actions?
0307237699|5.0|Barack is to be commended for a wonderful, honest, and intriguing book. I enjoyed the journey as I read each chapter, it was so visible at times I could actually imagine myself there as the events took place. His writing is like an artist with a canvass -- vivid, passionate, and spontaneous which is so appealing but also very refreshing.
B000HEYVD6|3.0|This book started out well, was exciting and had a good plot, but then it seemed to peak.  The book was about 100 pages too long with it seeming to take forever to end.  And when it did the ending was too predictable.
1401200605|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my son, who is a huge Batman fan.  He really likes the book and says that the illustrations are great.  He highly recommends this book to other Batman lovers.
0307237699|4.0|It's too bad that many people will probably steer clear of this book because of their political preference.  In today's extremely divided and bitter political climate, it's not unusual to see grown men and women yelling and interrupting each other and behaving like spoiled children.  It was refreshing to see Mr. Obama speak eloquently and realistically about where Democrats and Republicans could find common ground.  He doesn't pretend that the Democrat way is always the best way.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised that he had acknowledged faults in both liberal and conservative thinking.   <br /> <br />Some of the book is biographical, but I'd say most of it is Senator Obama's thoughts on current issues facing our country.  Each chapter is divided into themes such as, \\"Family,\\" \\"Race,\\" etc.  I have to agree that some of it is wordy and I did struggle to get through some of it.  However, I'm glad I did because once I got through a \\"rough patch\\" the book recaptured my attention. <br /> <br />Regardless of what happens in the next presidential election, I hope that both sides of the political spectrum can work in a more civil way and actually consider each other's ideas instead of towing the party line.  On the Democratic side, Senator Obama seems like an honorable man who is in Washington for the right reasons.  I hope that people consider both this book and offer any suggestions for any books written on the Republican side that offer ideas for progress, rather than just criticizing political opponents and those who vote for them.
0307237699|5.0|The book was refreshing. Very familar, like someone telling me the way things ought to be. Barack writes the way he speaks and that made for easy enjoyable reading. The only nagging question is, will running for president change him and make him behave like most successful candidates?
B000JVT092|4.0|Movie: <br />To tell the  truth, i never realy liked Superman, but this is the first Superman Movie i enjoyed. <br />Do not activated your brain though, just sit and enjoy. <br />But best of all and reason for me to watch this movie in the first place (second time already now, first in theatre and now on HD-DVD) is Kevin Spacey. he is just ONE KIND OF AN ACTOR and now with its bolt - i just love him !!!! <br />The special effects tend from very good to very obvious and cheap looking. Some ideas are so outrageous crazy (carrying an hole island) - thats why i never liked Superman - Batman or Spiderman do impossible things too, but still they are somehow more \\"believeable\\". <br />HD-DVD: <br />It is naturally better looking than the DVD but still it is not the picture you want to show off with your new HD Homecinema to your friends. It is most likely due to the use of filtering or what ever, but the picture lacks sharpness very often. <br />The sound is good but fare from any referenz level too. <br /> <br />Equipment: Toshiba HD-DVD Player, Mitsubishi HC-5000 Full HD Beamer, Denon Reciever, Canton Speaker <br /> <br />If you want to impress your friends, better go with KingKong or Polarexpress! <br />If you want to see Kevin Spacey in best Quality available right now - buy it.

B0002IQNAG|4.0|george romeros dawn of the dead is said to be the best zombie film ever made. although i like zombi 2 better, dawn of the dead is still a classic and one of the greatest in the genre. the movie is about 4 survivors of the zombie outbreak trying to survive in an abandoned mall infested with the living dead. if you havent seen this film than this is the version to buy. the ultimate edition is 4 discs and loaded with special features. there are 3 different versions of the film and it also comes with the first issue of the comic book. i like the extended edition best which has the most gore and more footage than the other 2 versions. the european version is the shortest of the 3 and has more of goblins music score. now you can see dawn of the dead in all its gory versions, the goriest being the extended edition. a great dvd of a great movie. buy it, even if you have any of the other versions individually. buy it now.
B00005U122|4.0|Roger Waters puts on a good show. His voice has diminished a bit, but he still does a good job at delivering vocals. It was nice to see him sing 'welcome to the machine' and 'wish you were here' where Dave Gilmour would have sang. To me it sounded awkward at first to hear him sing those songs due to his voice limitations, but also, nice at the same time to see the person who wrote the lyrics actually sing the song. I liked that he started off with a loud and explosive 'In the Flesh'. It was nice to hear some of his solo work as well. I'd hoped he would have done more from 'Pros and Cons' and 'Final Cut',  I like the way he remixes 'set the controls' it was different and good! Also thru out the show when he's doing the Floyd material, Roger and his band make little chages/tweeks to the songs at times that are interesting to hear if you are very familiar with the studio versions. 'Set the controls' is an Obvious one, but also the femaile vocals in welcome to the machine 9a great touch), too many to name. Roger also plays with a lot of physical movement. When he's not singing he's all over the stage; weather he's playing bass or guitar he plays with heart. he also used a lot of non verbal hand communications to describe things happening in the song. \\"My hands felt just like 2 baloons\\" When that lyric from 'Comfortably Numb' is sang (by Doyl Bramhall) Roger conveys the feelings to the audience. Now...about Doyle Bramhill. I did not like any of his vocals to fill in for the Dave Gilmour parts; sounds like he's trying to sing like Gilmour, but not doing well. He is though an excellent guitarist, delivering great solos and just excellent playing. Keyboardist/backing vocalist/other instruments Jon Carin (who has played w/ Foyd on their last 2 tours, the double agent) sings (and plays accoustic guitar) most of the Gilmour vocal part of 'Dogs'. This wasn't so bad, despite it still being a Gilmour imitation. I didn't like the drumming on this one. The drummer was great thru the show, but on 'Dogs' I really like the way Nick Mason played them on the  Floyd studio recording. He just did better fills, and uses more creativity to go with the flow of the music. I think the closer 'Each Small Candle' was a really good song, and a great way to end the show; 'Each small Candlel should have gotten more attention when he started playing it. I'd hoped he would use that song towards a folow up to 'Amused to Death' (which came out almost 15 years ago!).  Guitarist and once Floyd touring guitarist  Snowy White also does a great job. The concert is fun to watch. It doesn't bombard you with lasers, smoke, etc as seen on Pink Floyd's 'Pulse' dvd which I love and recommend since that was also a great concert performance, but 'In the Flesh' does seem to have a more intimate feel to it than 'Pulse'. Overall, a great viewing and listening experience. Highly Recommended!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I don't know why I've waited so long to review this film.  It is simply one of the greatest animated features of all time.  From the wonderful songs to the wonderful cast to the lovely animation, this film hits on all cylinders.  It's a moral story as old as time itself:  Beauty lies not upon the face, but within the heart.  If you haven't seen this movie, please consider renting or buying it soon.  It doesn't matter what age you are because this movie appeals to all age groups.<br /><br />Our heroine is, of course, the lovely Belle, who gives her freedom up so that her father can be released from Beast's castle.  Beast's servants, especially Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts, devise a plan for Belle to fall in love with Beast in order to break the curse that all of them suffer from.  Of course, much like in \\"Frankenstein,\\" that which is misunderstood is considered a monster and Belle's arrogant would-be suitor, Gaston, sets out to free his damsel-in-distress.<br /><br />The voice cast is wonderful.  It includes Robby Benson (Beast), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Jerry Orbach (my favorite, Lumiere), David Ogden Steirs (Cogsworth/Narrator), and Paige O'Hara as Belle.  Richard White portrays the selfish oaf, Gaston, and does a wonderful job.<br /><br />The music is top notch.  Composed by Alan Menken and given lyrics by Howard Ashman, the songs are some of the best and most memorable in Disney's catalogue.  From \\"Be Our Guest\\" to \\"Gaston,\\" they are all winners here.<br /><br />The animation is classic and contemporary at the same time.<br /><br />The DVD is nice.  It comes complete with the original and special editions of the film and a plethora of wonderful documentaries on the making of the film, it's music, and many other things as well.<br /><br />You would be wise to add this masterpiece to your collection.  I highly recommend it.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|hostel is one of the best modern horror films. if your tired of the pg13 teen horror films than hostel will feel like a gory breath of fresh air. its about these 3 backpackers who,while traveling through europe, are targetted for a viscous murder for profit buisness were wealthy people can act out their sickest fantasies on captured victims. the film is definately not for everyone. the torture scenes are very brutal and some people may not be able to handle it. one poor guy gets his leg and torso drilled with an electric drill and his achiles tendon cut. another guy gets taunted with scissors and hit witha small garden implement and his fingers are cut off buy a chainsaw. these torture scenes arent the only gore scenes. a torturer accidentally cuts off his leg with a chainsaw. another guy has his fingers cut off and his neck sliced. in the films most gruesome scene a womens face is burnt by a blowtorch, causing her eye to dangle out of its socket. the eye is then snipped off by a pair of scissors. the only problem with hostel is that the first 40 minutes are a bit slow moving. if it wasnt for the naked women all over the place, it would be boring, but once the film does pick up, it turns into a visceral and graphic horror experience. a great film that shouldnt be misses.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|\\"An Ancient Muse\\" is an evolutionary step in Loreena's music, if not particularly innovative.  As an artist whose music I've held in high esteem for a long time, I was not disappointed with the familiarity of the melodies.  Tracks 2-4 and 6-8 are spectacular.  As a serious audiophile I am unimpressed with most modern recordings but this one is first rate with great deep bass and absent digital compression artefacts.  I look forward to release of the DVD and hopefully a USA tour in 2007.
B00005JNS0|5.0|We just bought the Cars soundtrack as well.  My kids love the music on this movie.  This is so cute..although I will say you will hear the words idiot and shut up (which I don't agree with in kids movie's but I've heard worse).  Other than that my kids love this movie - and they are girls 5 and 2.
0767802519|4.0|This movie was Luc Besson's first English film.  Set in modern day New York, it's the story of Leon, played well by Jean Reno, who is a professional hitman working for an Tony, an Italian mobster played by Danny Aiello.  The movie opens with Leon being given instructions by Tony, to track down a rival mobster and force him to talk to Tony.  In an phenomenally action-packed sequence, Leon manages to force the rival to talk to Tony on the phone.  Really, this first sequence alone is almost worth the price of admission, it's that well done.  Besson is certainly in his element when it comes to directing intense action packed sequences.   <br /> <br />The movies continues in this vein as Leon arrives home to see his neighbor being threatened a gang of thugs that turns out to be a group of DEA agents led by Norman Stansfield, played wonderfully by Gary Oldman.  Oldman is brilliant in the role of the twisted DEA agent with a bloody streak.  The next day, when Oldman and his corrupt band of DEA agents come back and wreak vengeance on the whole family, Leon reluctantly saves Mathilda from the bloodbath and basically ends up with an adopted daughter.  Leon and Mathilda are both fractured people emotionally.  Mathilda had been at least physically abused by both her father, step-mother and step-sister.  Leon was apparently brought from the old country as an illiterate immigrant and trained as \\"a cleaner\\".  It's obvious that his boss, Tony, is taking advantage of him, and Leon is unable to do much about it.  But in any case Mathilda and Leon form a bond, which makes some sense given the circumstances.  What makes less sense is that Leon would seriously instruct this 12 year old girl in how to make professional mob hits, but who knows, life is stranger than fiction. <br /> <br />Mathilda, by the way, is played by Natalie Portman, in the movie that is probably the high point of her career to date.  In any case, her work in this movie is far more impressive than anything else she'sdone, including the second Star Wars trilogy and V is for Vendetta.  However, Portman was 12 or 14 when this movie was made, and the movie may get uncomfortably close to pedophillia for some.  There is absolutely nothing sexual about the relationship between Leon and Mathilda in the movie, except that Mathilda does develop a crush for Leon. <br /> <br />Overall, the acting is exceptional.  The cinematography is excellent, and the direction, especially of the action scenes is outstanding.  There are a lot of familiar overtones in this film that would later appear in The Fifth Element.  Besson is at his best developing an ominous intense feel for an action sequence.  For instance, the scene where the police are setting up for their second attempt at storming Leon's apartment is very reminiscent of the heavy-handed way Besson's 22nd century NY Police acted in The Fifth Element. <br /> <br />But the combination of the fatherhood/puppy love factor in a action thriller about a professional hitman may be a little disconcerting for some.  Others might call it new and fresh, I found it interesting but a little disturbing.  It's certainly not a movie you see and just forget.
B00005JO9J|5.0|It has been a long time since a tv drama has come out that is refreshing. Grey's Anatomy looked like just another medical drama to me until I watched it on the advice of my mother, who is like me, an avid ER fan. I am now addicted. The characters on this show are interesting, and flawed in a different way than the usual (i.e. Merideth Grey's promiscuity to which she fully admits, or Christina's incredible competitiveness even when it doesn't matter). I think that this show is very interesting and well written, and encourage any fan of drama to give it a try.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|I ordered Sex and the City--the complete series and received a set of defective DVDs.  Upon returning them and ordering a replacement set, I received another set of defective DVDs.  Customer service was pleasant enough, but it was found that ALL of the sets of DVDs in the entire lot are defective.  I am still waiting on my refund.  Instead of finding a way to get their hands on good quality DVDs, I was told, \\"oh well.\\"  So I purchased the item from somewhere else.  Avoid my headaches!  Do Not Buy!!!

B000LC3ID8|5.0|Saw 3 is so well done- so well written its laughable that anyone could give it a bad review. Some people apparently didn't get it. This is the best horror series ever. How many series have a stronger part 3 in their catalogue?  I think this one is as good or better than the first one, because it was a different idea as well as tight scripting and the fact that nobody is off limits from Jigsaw's games. This should have won an oscar, yeah I said it. What would you rather watch Brokeback Mountain or the inner workings of Jigsaw before he has brain surgery. This edition keeps the body count low, but the severity of the torture is the highest to date. One poor guy gets the Theisman treatment on not one but 5 parts of his body. Somewhere in D.C. Theisman is watching this and peeing himself. Jigsaw is a unique cat, he is up to his tricks with his lovely assistant Shawnee Smith as well. Lots of great scenes explaining more about the first 2 epic films. I thought this film had some of the rudest scenes in a long time, so its not for everyone. Its also not for everyone who thinks Saw 3 should be exactly like the first movie, move on and open your mind to a fresh idea and evolution. So to sum it up, the best series ever just got better, whats not to like?
B000B8QG0O|5.0|This DVD with accompanying material is a great follow-up to Toy Story 1, and arguably less scary for young children. We have enjoyed watching it many times since receiving it.

There's much better out there, and although the cinematography is fantastic, I wouldn't want to wade my way through this movie again, unless I was fast asleep.
B00005JNS0|5.0|The movie arrived fast. The packaging was well protected in another box and the product was in original packing. The movie surprised me and was really good. Generally I do not like kid movies, but I will sit through them with my kids. This one was good and had a great story line.

B000M4RG42|3.0|War movies are strange since people almost never seem to want to criticize them in any form, as it's deemed \\"unpatriotic\\". It's also strange that these kind of films usually offer me little attachment. Yeah, war is hell and soldiers did and saw things that I'd probably never in my lifetime see; yet at the same time it's hard to invest in character that usually aren't given that much emotions to utilize. And so we have Flags of Our Fathers, directed by Clint Eastwood, and filmed back-to-back with Letters from Iwo Jima, which tells of the Japanese side of the battle. Is Flags a great war movie or just the lesser half of a whole? <br /> <br />The film centers around the iconic photograph taken during the battle on the island of Iwo Jima in 1945. The photograph however, was the 2nd one taken, since a politician wanted the original as a souvenir and a replacement had to be used. That photograph made it to print all over America and became a huge sensation to the point where 3 men: John \\"Doc\\" Bradley, Ira Hayes and Rene Gagnon (since the other 3 died during the battle) are sent home on a tour to promote the idea of buying bonds and fund the war. Of course there's more to it than that as restrictions are placed on the men, demands have to be met and any of them not met results in the man being sent back into war. The men conflict as they're being called heroes simply for raising a flag while everyone else is fighting the good fight. <br /> <br />Apparently Letters is meant to be the more straight forward of the 2 since Flags is very ambitious. From the battle scenes to the re-creation of events, it's certainly an admirable picture to like since there's so much attention to detail on screen. The problem is, and it's possibly a poor man's Tarantino or something, but the film just can't seem to sit still. We follow one event, flash back to the war, and at a certain point we'll see the first event just before it happens then later we'll see the same event before the one beforeit which came later. Confused? It's better explained in the film and even then it's unnecessary. Do we have to flashback before an event then see the events leading up to the event in such a jumbled manner? Doubt. <br /> <br />Acting-wise it seems filled to the brim with recognizable talent. From Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, Robert Patrick, Barry Pepper or Jamie Bell, you get the feeling that everyone in the film has that \\"now where did I see that guy before?\\" aura. However, we're not given much on their story and there's this weird kind of emotional severing we feel, which we shouldn't since this is war but you never really get intimate with the characters even though we spend a lot of time with them. The only 2 that I really thought about was Ira Hayes and another soldier played by Jamie Bell. The former realizes right away the publicity is unwarranted and as a result he develops a drinking problem which worses his post-traumatic stress disorder. The latter we never see his outcome but reading up on it you'll find one of the worst cases of torture I've ever seen. <br /> <br />Nothing is worse for a DVD fan than the words \\"double dip\\". In some cases they're necessary since the original DVD was so crappy they had to make a new one (Seven or Titanic) but in other cases it's basically a knowing cash-grab: release a movie with little to no extras then a few months later release it again but packed to the brim with stuff (Day After Tomorrow, Man on Fire). This? It's only other feature is \\"Setup\\" which changes the audio settings. That's it. Not one single EPK back-patting feature? Nope. Expect a 2-disc edition somewhere down the line, most likely an extended edition with even more stuff. <br /> <br />Should you buy it? Even if you were a fan, I'd say no if you like all the bonus features. But should you watch? Sure, there's enough reason to but not enough to recommend to anyone that it's THE film to see.

1582701709|4.0|While the DVD and book are inspirational and wonderful for those embarking on the path to \\"what more is there?”, it is incomplete.  The Secret works well for ‘smaller’ manifestations, but for higher achievements, there are no shortcuts.  Life requires uncovering and transcending deep, subconscious emotional blockages (fear).   <br /> <br />All of the great teachings speak not only of the necessity for visualization of the end result, but also of the mental/emotional WORK requisite.  The proof is in the results.  That said, this is a worthwhile book and DVD.  Get both. <br />
B00005JP9V|3.0|Children of Men, as you may already know, is a film about a future society (2027), where like V for Vendetta, Britain is portrayed by the government as the last bastion of normalcy in the world, and let me tell you it's not doing so well.  Bombings, violence, and terrorism are common, apparently all due to the fact that several years prior, and this is the crucial idea, women stopped having babies.      That's all just set-up though, as we haven't got to the plot of the movie, which is where Clive Owen's character, Theo comes in.  Theo is cynical about the world, and seems to be okay with just letting it go to the wayside, until his ex-wife meets up with him, and trusts in him a girl, more specifically a pregnant girl (which in a world without babies is pretty rare).  From there the adventure begins...    Well, supposedly, because to me, this is sadly a simple, and obvious plot, and if it weren't for the exciting action sequences, particularly this one extremely long-shot sequence (which I will say is definitely impressive), then really I'd probably just give it two stars.  However, unlike most two-star films I sensed effort and some albeit limited success with that effort, thus my deeming this film as mediocre as a 3-star film can be (instead of the poorer 2-star).
0192853619|5.0|Just the kind of book that a highschool level student or an underclassman college kid might enjoy.  Full of good fundamental ideas and very interesting mathematical concepts.  Written at a level which is very approachable and readable, even for that majority of the population which didn't become math majors.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|So, you may think to yourself, Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon.  Hmmm.... Of course then there's Leonardo DiCaprio, but he too is a mixed bag.  Then you expect Jack Nicholson to have to save the film; however, that would in my opinion be very false, because Scorsese and all the actors mentioned above, plus more, turn The Departed into a really intriguing film, and truly deserving of an Oscar or two. <br /> <br />The story, in case you don't know, follows these two young officers rising up in the Boston police force.  One officer, Matt Damon's character has a perfect record and becomes leadership, while the other, Leo's character, has a family history that, due to the family's deviousness, makes him perfect for undercover work.  As such, both are part of the larger task force set-up to take down, legally speaking, Jack Nicholson's character, who is the local mob boss.  Sounds simple enough, but here's where it gets interesting as Leo infiltrates the mob, while, and as we see early on, Damon's been working for Nicholson from youth, thus leading to them both being 'rats', with plenty of cats just waiting to find them. <br /> <br />Sound exciting?  Well, I hope so because it certainly was.  Although, giving it a four and not a five may make you wonder why, so here are my few problems with the film.  Basically, I find the film unrealistic, as this film takes place in modern times, and I believe the police and mob would look substantially different, especially in terms of technology.  The other problem is the ending, but don't worry I'm not going to give it away, but I just want to say it felt a little unsatisfying. <br /> <br />Just to reinforce my liking the film, I will state to the contrary that all of the actors did a marvelous job, especially Wahlberg and DiCaprio.  Having Martin Sheen didn't hurt, as he added his own sense to the film too, which I duly appreciated. <br /> <br />Well, hopefully now you have a brief understanding of this film, one of Scorsese's tops, and additionally may you yourself see the film, and find equal pleasure.  (Because now I have to see Infernal Affairs, the film this film is based on!)
0800141601|3.0|If you are looking for a more realistic and epic version of the legend, you have come to the right film. First Knight is a film of epic scope with beautiful sets, a sweeping score, and some terrific performances.<br /><br />The actors do a good job with the film though some are better then others. Sean Connery is perfect as the older but not always wiser King Arthur. It is definitely one of Connery's better performances as of late and he makes the relationship between him and the much younger Guinevere seem realistic and believable. Richard Gere's Lancelot does lack some of the believability of Arthur. This is due mostly to the kung-fu sword fighting he does he is a very well established version of the Lancelot character. The chemistry between him and Arhur and him and Guinevere is believable. Julia Ormond is a little bit lacking as Guinevere for reasons I really can't explain.  Add to these three a wonderful villain in the form of Ben Cross and a good supporting cast and you get a pretty darn good cast.<br /><br />The other major star of the film is its terrific and sweeping score by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith. Goldsmith's terrific fanfare theme for Arhtur is one of the most terrific themes to appear in any of the late composer's scores. His action themes during the various battle sequences are beyond your usual action themes. Add on that the truly amazing choral arrangements added into the score and First Knight becomes something more then your typical action movie.<br /><br />The DVD is a bit of a disapoinment. The DVD has both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the movie but that's it. There is not one single special feature on the DVD. I mean there could have been a trailer or commentary or making of documentary or something. But the film is the real star of the DVD so if you like the film or want just the movie, get this DVD.
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Lee Marvin and Chuck Bronson are both top-flight actors, and their presence in this movie only makes an excellent 'chase' plot that much the better.  This is one that can be watched when the desire to see a good action film hits again and again as it contains interesting nuances and issues that keep it from getting 'old.'
0684859106|4.0|I have made a couple of things from this book and the recipes have worked out well. I make the cupcakes often and get lots of compliments for them. I find all the recipes have far too much sugar in them though (perhaps this is an American thing for over-sweet cakes?) so I just reduce the sugar and they still work out fine.

B000K7VHQE|3.0|I was disappointed in this 'indy'.  I had heard and read that it was one of the funniest movies in years etc.  It was humerous, but not funny.  Perhaps I missed something when I either read or watched it, but missed it did.  I would recommend watching but not buying.  In a year or so I expect the thing will be in the four for ten dollar pile at Blockbuster, then buy it.

B000M4RG42|3.0|This was a great film. I saw it in the theater. However, the DVD edition is a short changer (why I gave it 3 stars). For certain, within 6 months there will be a box set out with this film and the companion piece \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\". Save the money and purchase it then. I predict that package will also have plenty of extras. Don't fall for the old marketing trick of forcing you to purchase a film 3 or 4 times.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|The day has come!  I have waited since the release of BE, for a pain of salvation album that destoy's like no other!  One listen to the album and I was hooked.  It was nothing i imagined it would be.  Which means, in POS terms, brilliant, perfect, beautiful, angry, hateful, depressing, somehow Daniel is able to make every human emotion possible a part of this album.  The perfect element II:  I think it's worthy of the title.  Scarsick just has that \\"in your face'ness\\" which makes an album wortly of 5 stars.  I have a hard time writing reviews on music that is great because words are never enough to justify the music.  Buy this album, listen to it, and love it.  Can't wait till Part III
B000LE1FAY|5.0|For those who think Belinda Carlisle's career peaked with \\"Heaven Is a Place on Earth,\\" (her subsequent, brilliant albums woefully overlooked in the U.S.) with VOILA, they've got an earth-shattering surprise of the most delightful kind in store.  Those of us who've heard Belinda Carlisle perform live know that she is the real deal -- a genuine talent with a fantastic range and charisma to spare -- and VOILA finds her attaining an entirely new level of achievement that's genuinely thrilling.  You've got to admire an artist who challenges herself with a project like this...and hits it \\"out of the ballpark.\\"  While the material is classic, here it is never derivative and often very surprising, with adventurous instrumentation, arrangements, production and, of course, Carlisle's flawless singing.<br /><br />VOILA is Belinda Carlisle's \\"tour de force.\\"  Don't miss it!
B000JLTRIG|2.0|I must admit,season 7 was perhaps the worst of the post Shannon Dougherty years.After hitting a creative peak in seasons four and five.(Season six despite the negative reviews was a solid season.)The series seemingly hit a wall in season seven.I honestly believe (sorry Charmed Fans) that 7 & 8 should have been combined to form one great final season instead of a bad season and a mediocre one.<br /><br />UPDATE:Season 8 is slated to come out during September 2007,but the music (including the theme song) will be changed.I recently found out that budget cuts caused Daryl and Leo's disappearance (well Leo's semi-disappearance!) but can someone explain Billie & Christy to me? Their addition to the storyline...uh,yuck! The last episode made up for those two,thank goodness.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|If you want an album that will help you escape the \\"hustle and bustle\\" of the world, this is the album for you. Similar to Jill Scott and Maxwell, Corrine's music will transport you to another world. I, for one, commute a total of 30 minutes to an hour a day,and I have found that if I put this album in the player, I can relax and I am less uptight and frustrated when I get home. And finally, her unique voice has is reminiscent of some of the best jazz, blue and neo soul artists.  And of course \\"Enchantment\\" is my favorite!

However, half of the pages are filled with photos of the late Susan Sontag, Ms. Liebovitz's partner, and many others are taken of her family. <br />  Although there are some good ones, it wasn't the creative array of photos that I was looking forward to.  I wish I had seen it before I ordered it.

B0002EXH5O|3.0|Alright, so I finally decided I needed Rust in Peace on CD (I'd dealt with it on tape for about fifteen years) and seeing the new remastered edition, I figured it would be a good one to buy. So I put it in my CD player. The first two songs, fine. Then \\"Take No Prisoners\\", and the weirdness begins. The vocals sounded...cruddy as a cover band. Then \\"Five Magics\\". Wasn't it \\"Bestow upon me KNOWLEDGE\\", not \\"Magic\\"? Ah, I thought, maybe I'm wrong. But then at the end of the song...is that a muppet singing along with Mustaine? I thought that part was scarier on tape. As my tape is broken, I search out an unremixed CD. I wasn't going nuts. This new CD was much suckier than the original on these two songs at least. Everything else was fine, and did sound a little better than the original, and after looking around online I read that the original vocal tracks for these songs had been lost. But wouldn't it have been better to just not remix and remaster them than wreck the songs? Any kid that's never heard the real versions of these songs is gonna burst out laughing at something that used to be insanely great. Hopefully a future remix will fix this.
B0009IW9CK|3.0|This album is lacking the energy and fun of his earlier albums - However, I must say that \\"Martha Say\\" and \\"Pop Singer\\" are classics <br /> <br />NOTE: When this album was released it got blasted by the critics and Mellencamp was accused of becoming a country singer - Mellencamp fired back with his \\"Whenever We Wanted\\" album a year later and put all of those country singer claims to rest

0688170528|2.0|Having read several of Jodi Picoult's other books, I was expecting something much better than The Pact.  I found this book to be at times ridiculous in terms of plot and dialogue and at other times amateur-ish.  Some of the attempts at characterization were so ham-handed, the author might as well have just bullet-pointed the characteristics for us.  And let's not even mention Kate, since she was nothing more than a cardboard cut-out.   <br /> <br />I kept waiting for the author to reveal what was so terrible about Emily's life that she felt the need to kill herself.  This was never resolved and left me feeling like the whole book was just not credible.  I'm not a reader that minds the author not spelling everything out, but there was just nothing there.  What was the sexual abuse angle?  I kept waiting for an \\"ah ha!\\" moment which never came.  Did she see Chris as an incestuous abuser due to the brother-sister nature of their relationship?  Is that why she shrank away from sex with him, and if so, what caused her to change?  Was it the guy at the fast-food restaurant?  And what was that incident all about, any way?  I got that she was molested but didn't read into it as a rape.  I'm not trying to downplay the incident, but I just don't buy that for years, she had no problems and then this bubbled into a devastating suicidal depression several years later. <br /> <br />And, if Chris loved her so much and was supposedly a smart and level-headed teen with a good relationship with his parents, her parents, and his teachers, why did he not confide in any one and get Emily help?  Aside from the absurd ending, this to me is one of the key elements that ruins the book for me.  It is simply not believable.  Now, if he were suicidal too, then that might fly but he was not.  The author asks us to believe Chris apparently regarded depression as a terminal illness with no hope and no cure for the sufferer and himself as the angel of mercy in ending her life. <br /> <br />Also, regarding the relationship between her and Chris....it seemed like it went from Emily being completely repulsed by the sexual aspects of the relationship to being fully participating shortly thereafter.  I couldn't see the transition....mostly because there wasn't one!  It just simply didn't ring true and I guess ultimately, that same can be said for the entire book.  Just don't get me started on the absolutely ridiculous outcome of the trial.  Did no one do a DNA analysis of the baby to determine if it was Chris's?  If so, it was never mentioned.  Of course, readers knew it was his, but the legal system didn't.  Now there's a hole a mile wide for the defense to use (which it didn't) which made no sense since that was part of his supposed \\"motivation\\" to kill her.  And there is no jury on the planet who would have acquitted him.  <br /> <br />All in all, a very disappointing read that had too many unrealistic elements to be believable.  Ms. Picoult is a very talented writer, but that just didn't show in this book.  <br />
B00000G3PA|5.0|I loved this movie!  I laughed so much because of the truly funny lines and and cried because of the nobility of the characters!
B00005JPGO|4.0|I always thought of Leonardo DiCaprio as a bit of a 'twit', as the English say. But I must admit, I believed every second of his portrayal of Danny Archer, the un-PC Rhodesian mercenary. More than I believed any of the other characters, except maybe Arnold Vosloo. In fact, DiCaprio was the character that turned this super-PC movie into something that went beyond that and thereby, and despite its \\"I'm Important!\\"-shouting ending, made it into a 'good' movie.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou were burdened with lines so loaded with 'message' that it was almost cringe-factor-10 material. That they managed it to deliver most of them without me wanting to duck every time one of those lines was coming, is a testament to their skill. But in the end it was DiCaprio's sustained characterization--and accent!--that kept it all going.<br /><br />Blood Diamond, whose best and most enduring lines were those relating to the acronym 'TIA' (This Is Africa), wears the 'important' label like a General wears his decorations. Still, its impact is lost in overkill. The same movie without the message-bits would have been simply superb. And without that hokey ending, of course. Does anybody really believe that this trade is ever going to stop? Does anybody really believe that the true evildoers are the traders, middle-men, corrupt government officials, local potentates--and not the ultimate buyers themselves: the people of small minds and/or stupid vanities? For the majority of these diamonds do not go to the rich and powerful, but to those who flood into the local cheap-special-offer jewelry store when the occasions for buying arise or are fabricated by the peddlers of the goods. Without customers there are no middle-men and peddlers turn their attention to something people will buy instead.<br /><br />Apart from all that, let's look at another message of this movie: the one  about the child-soldiers in Africa, and everywhere else, for that matter. The Hitlerjugend happened in the middle of Europe, remember--and there's nothing new about this anyway. When you need some killers and are running out of grown-ups, the young are the most impressionable and easiest to mold. Even volunteer armies consist mostly of those qualifying as 'young'--and for good reasons, one of which is that in their brains one is more likely to find 'impressionability' and a lack of big-picture judgment. I believe the age of cerebral maturity is somewhere around the age of 25. Most soldiers are significantly younger than that.<br /><br />So, nothing new about child-soldiers, and if anybody thinks that's going to change, think again. The point was that as a 'point' to be made in a movie, Blood Diamond practiced overkill. The same point was made with much more impact and much more to the gut in Tears of The Sun, when one of the team of SEALs, while interfering in some ethnic cleansing in the middle of the jungle, killed one of those in the process of some serious rape and violence--only to find, to his horror that \\"He's just a kid. Just a f--g kid!\\" The look on the soldier's face as he stared close-up at the face of the dying child-soldier he's just stabbed: that will stay with me forever. Related scenes in Blood Diamond I already have a problem recalling. But what I do remember about it are all scenes involving 'Danny Archer'--which tells me something about the caliber of the actor who represented him.<br /><br />Here we have the difference between bad and good story-telling. But, of course, Tears of the Sun was a flick about US soldiers having a conscience and one with Bruce Willis at that. So it can't possibly have been as 'important' and was probably pure US Navy propaganda. Right? Never mind that it asked more questions per average minute of film than Blood Diamond asked in an hour. It's just that they weren't shoved into your face with a \\"Look here! Important stuff coming up!\\"<br /><br />Still, ignoring the gratuitous proselytizing, this was a damn good movie--and thanks to DiCaprio for making it that way.good movie--and thanks to DiCaprio for making it that way.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|An incredible CD, I can listen to it through and through and over and over again.  A well made compilation from an amazing band and the mixes done to the songs are something to truly admire.  A good CD to get for a diehard beatles fan or someone just getting started.

B00005NB8K|3.0|The Doors <br /> <br />Some reviewers seem annoyed that the film is actually about Jim Morrison and not about The Doors.  And it's true.  The band seems like a canvas upon which Jim Morrison can sing, act out, drink, and otherwise remain perpetually painted at the forefront of this film.  Oliver Stone's camera is enamored with Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison.  And Kilmer's performance is quite exciting, indeed.  But I wonder why Stone lets Kilmer steal the entire movie.  Where are The Doors?  Where's the history of the band?  The movie suggests that The Doors revolve entirely around Morrison and that the stories of the other band members, while likely less crazy and sensational, are not at all interesting without Morrison's presence and influence. <br /> <br />I think the tragedy of Jim Morrison's life is that he actually believed that drugs, sex, and alcohol - mixed with a soul trapped by societal conventions - somehow opens the artist to the infinite beauty of the universe.  But really, it's pain that drives all good art.  Morrison writes, speaks, and sings of his poor relationship with his parents.  He sought the convention of a happy family by desensitizing himself rather than facing his fear of utter abandonment honestly and soberly.  It's this pain that makes Morrison somewhat sympathetic.  Despite his determination to live as an alcoholic drug addict, some pain seeped out, taking the forms of poetry, film, and music. <br /> <br />Perhaps psychoanalyzing Morrison is too easy, but we aren't given much else from Stone and Kilmer.  Whenever Morrison appears drunken and aggressive in front of the band, watch the faces of the band members.  They know exactly what's wrong with Morrison as they fight the futile battle of getting Morrison sober enough to sing another song.

B00006JKOL|5.0|This album has an excellent mix of great examples of the different sides of Tull - acoustic folk song (\\"One White Duck\\"), heavy metal (\\"Black Satin Dancer\\"), folk-lore (\\"Cold Wind To Valhalla\\"), and epic progressive (folk) rock (\\"Baker St. Muse\\" is kind of a return to \\"Thick As A Brick\\", but only 16 minutes this time!).  The musicians are superb.  John Evans's Beethoven-inspired playing here converted me from someone who didn't like piano in rock.  Martin Barre has a unique style of playing - not really sounding like other hard rock or progressive rock guitarists, but adept at both.  This whole album is unique and magnificent.
B000J103PC|5.0|I thought this would be a chick flick all the way, but it was much better than that. Meryl Streep is wonderfully icy, fanatical, and spot-on as the driven publisher, Miranda, of the trend-setting monumental fashion mag \\"Runway.\\" And Anne Hathaway is terrific as the naive but brilliant waif Andrea, who wanders, as does the viewer, into a bizarre world where a tiny minority of super-rich and self-impressed lunatics obsess about fashion. I suppose this film could only be made in America and specifically in New York. It brings out the good, the bad, and the ugly about our crazed culture, but it's immensely entertaining, in large part because Meryl brings her perfectly pitched character to calmly frantic life in scene after nerve-jangling scene. Go see it. You'll like it.
B00008G9JM|5.0|This is one of the most sophisticated pieces of rock music I've ever heard.  It's one continuous piece of music (well, excluding a few minutes in the middle, where we get \\"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\" - a surreal little children's tale to music, kind of reminiscent of Cream's \\"Pressed Rat & Warthog\\").  The lyrics (as I understand) tell the tale of the journey of a soul through the afterlife - visiting Heaven, Hell, etc.  They kind of remind me of the German author Goethe's \\"Faust\\".  Ian Anderson was one of the more intelligent lyricists in rock.  People seem concerned about how obscure the lyrics are,  but this could be a complaint of a lot of great rock music (including most pop), not to mention opera and other \\"high art\\" music that is usually sung in a foreign language.  The fantastic lyrics add a lot to my appreciation, but it's not like I need to comprehend the meaning to enjoy the CD.  The music is fantastic - a seamless blend of rock, classical, jazz, etc.; weird and unique, but musically enjoyable and never pointless (to my ears).   As another reviewer noted, Tull tends to avoid the instrumental showing off of other 70's musicians.  It's full of great melodies and riffs, even if it can't be crammed into a simple verse-chorus structure.  This album also features sax to a higher degree than other Tull albums, yet without sounding like soul or jazz sax - it fits the overall classical/rock feel of the whole thing (maybe a bit reminiscent of Van Der Graaf Generator). <br />Anyway, if you're interested in challenging, intelligent, or unusual music, you're in for a treat.  If you just like music or Jethro Tull, don't worry about the complexity - it's still worth a listen, it's OK if you don't understand it!  Of course, if you just want simple, straight-forward rock/pop songs or \\"jam\\" music, this is NOT for you.

B00008G9JN|5.0|Jethro Tull fuses rock, heavy metal, classical, folk, and traditional music (among others) into a seamless whole.  Although this album is considered one of their \\"folkier\\" ones, it's more do to an overall feel and folklore-inspired lyrics; they're not doing rock versions of traditional music like Steeleye Span or Fairport Convention (although some of the music here gets kind of jiggy at times).  What they are doing, however, is brilliant!  This album immerses you in the feel of the English countryside.  It's a very uplifting and wonderful album, and sounds like nothing else I've ever heard (well, until Blackmore's Night came around, maybe).  I may also note that most of the \\"new\\" Tull fans I know (that is, those who don't like a particular era of Tull because of nostalgia of when the albums came out) consider this their best release, myself included.

Belinda and the brilliant Brian Eno create one of the most atmospheric albums out there!  Should be in everyone's collection! <br /> <br />
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I don't care what anyone says. This is one of his best films. The fact that it is his highest grossing film is equally deserving for him. <br /> <br />Just the way it was shot, edited, scored (with some good pop tunes, especially from the Dropkick Murphy's) and the brilliant performances from Nicholson (Has he ever given a bad one? I think not) to Dicaprio ( I think he is a pretty good actor) <br /> <br />Yes the picture is a little slow in the middle, but that is narrative transition for you, and yes it is violent and full of bad language, but thats normal for Marty's work. <br /> <br />I've seen this movie twice in the theater and I already ordered the two disc DVD, and come oscar night, if it doesn't win for director and picture, I am going to scream.
0060987464|5.0|Ihis is a must read for fans because it has awesome photos,it tells of his childhood, it tells what goes on beind stage, how he got introduced to the church of satan, and just a deep look inside the mind/world of Manson.    People that are not fans I still recommend it because maybe after reading this book, you will realize that he is not some crazed devil worshipper.
0226264203|5.0|This book (like Hayek's Road to Serfdom) will require you to frequently turn back to the publication information to convince yourself that it wasn't published in the last few years.  It remains very topical, but is no longer the radical prescription it once was -- by force of will and arguement, Friedman has begun to revolutionize society.

0060254920|5.0|The inexplicable attraction of the fascination of the abomination begins young. I have no idea why both my children have deeply loved Where the Wild Things Are, but it holds a hypnotic fascination for them and they both beg for it at least twice a week.<br /><br />The simple narrative follows an unfolding and reverse structure, and the dramatic turning point was the hero's conversion from aggression to the lonely consequences of his alienation, this is the mom-and-chicken-soup version of the prodigal son parable.<br /><br />Sendak's line drawings are a wonder to behold: the detail still defies comprehension, for the sheer labour of inking alone, much less the sketching, must have taken months of toil.<br /><br />If you have more than one child, the hardback edition is the better value.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|If you could rate a film with a minus sign, this one would get a minus Star!  There is very little, if any, factual, scientifically documented material in this film.  How dumb do you have to be to believe that this film has any value?  Please note that the film's premise is based on the \\"Hockey Stick\\" theory and sadly for Gore, that theory has been debunked - so his entire film is \\"suspect\\" at best.  The claims al gore makes in this film are so utterly stupid that it's almost a waste of time arguing them.  After viewing this film, you should demand \\"scientific proof\\" - do NOT be misguided into believing \\"consensus\\" - scientists must have documented proof and there is none in this film.  Yes, the globe is warming - it has been for centuries; it's also cooling.  So what?  Better to spend the money and power on something useful - like discovering a cure for cancer.  The scary part of this film is the unbelieveable ease that so many people accept it all as fact and refuse to question any thing the film declares as fact.  To accept theory and conjecture as fact is a very dangerous practice; it is not how scientists work - thank God.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|this is an excellent DVD from a band thats really hit their stride. <br />a 2006 concert shot with multiple camaras shows the progressive rockers from Tampa, fla. perform with theatrical flair and plenty of metal. a pretty good song list that they play seriously tight. Khan on vocals is perfect for this band and Thomas Youngblood is tearing it up on guitar. <br /> <br />a great buy! many thumbs up.

0385474547|2.0|I've read this book because students in my school are forced to read it and I was curious to find out why teenagers do not like to read. Now I understand. I can barely give this book 2 stars. The book is divided in 3 parts, being the first one the longer and more focused on the life of Okonkwo, the main character of this book. As a document to understand the Igbo culture, this may work. As a piece of fiction, a novel, literature, this does not work at all. Achebe is one of the main opponents of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but what Achebe forgets is that Heart of Darkness is still today a classic, one of the best books written in the English language, despite his controversial depiction of the peoples of Congo. When I read a book I want to be told a good story. And a good story is written with words. One must master the art of writing prior to tell us a story. To me, Achebe lacks of that. On the contrary, Conrad is a masterful writer. I also wanted to say that it is a contradiction to me that Achebe chose to write his book in English. If he is so mad at the English who invaded his home land, he should have the pride, courage and integrity to write the book in his own language. If the book was good, it would have been translated. The best thing in this book are the verses from W.B. Yeats at the beginning of the book, from his poem \\"The Second Coming\\". After these four verses, the book has no interest. If I was an English teacher in High School, I would have my students read Conrad instead of Achebe. Perhaps more teenagers would be hooked with reading.
B00005LC3Y|3.0|Why has there not been a widescreen DVD edition of this movie? Great film. In nessence, this film is Kubrick's answer to the hyper-emotional, neo-jingoistic drivel that passed for Vietnam movies.<br /><br />I just want to see a widescreen edition with the original aspect ratio maintained.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is the best musical movie I have seen. It is hard to believe it is a \\"low budget\\" movie as the director and co-producer said in their interview. Although many of you have known the story, it is very worthy to collect the movie DVD version because of the superb settings and excellent music. I think it is a \\"must have\\" type of product.
B000K7UBTI|2.0|After watching the two Avengers animated movies this one fell flat.  The Tony Stark in this movie did not have much personality, and the story was slow.

B000002LFU|5.0|Great album from REM, my favorite songs are Orange Crush, Wrong Child, World Leader Pretend, Pop Song 89 and the best of all, I remember California; Peter Buck guitar style makes me feel out of this planet on that song, the chorus sang by Michael gives me goose bumps..

B000ICL3KG|5.0|This documentary contains several facts about the truth of our environment and simple ways to change the rapid abuse our planet is suffering.  The facts of global warming are shocking and they are not going away on their own.  Al Gore was able to capture and prove the scientific evidence that is changing our planet and the impact the human race has on our home.  One viewing of this incredible movie will change one's view from ignorance to action!
1400031567|4.0|A policeman's lot is not a happy one!  W.S. Gilbert. <br /> <br />Even in Sweden if Henning Mankell's police procedurals provide any clue.  Detective Inspector Wallander's lot is not a happy one in \\"Sidetracked\\".  By the time you get through the first two chapters Wallander has seen an unidentified teenage girl douse herself with gasoline and watched helplessly as she burned to death. He is then placed in charge of the investigation of the murder of a former Minister of Justice who was killed with an axe and then scalped.  To make matters worse, while Wallander is busy trying to solve these apparently unrelated events, Sweden has pretty much come to a standstill as the whole nation (with the possibly sole exception of Wallander) as it watches Sweden's run to third place in the 1994 World Cup.  As Sweden's World Cup fever increases the scalper strikes again and again and Wallander feels as if he is the only person not glued to a TV set.   <br /> <br />Mankell's Kurt Wallander series is often compared to the Martin Beck detective mysteries authored by the husband and wife team of Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall. Wallander, like Beck, is a police detective in Sweden. Unlike Beck, whose beat was Stockholm, Wallander works in the small southern-Swedish city of Ystad. The Wallander series takes place in the 1990s while the Beck series took place in the 1960s and 1970s. Although I tend to prefer the Beck series, the Wallander books are entertaining page-turners. Mankell stays well within the `police procedural' formula and has not tried to reinvent the genre. However, he has done a good job of developing the character of Mankell and his supporting cast of characters. Wallander is no Sherlock Holmes and gets results more by perspiration than inspiration. He is also a fully drawn character. We see him dealing with the break-up of a marriage, an estranged daughter, and a father who is developing senile dementia. The supporting characters, particularly his fellow detectives, are also well drawn. <br /> <br />I thought Mankell did a good job in Sidetracked.  As the plot is advanced we see Wallander struggling to find clues and then struggling to get a grasp of their meaning.  The reader has an advantage in that Mankell reveals more to the reader than to Wallander.  The interest for the reader (or at least for me) is to see Wallander gradually put the pieces together.  Basically, this is a well-written police procedural.  It does not break new ground or transcend its genre but it is a very entertaining, if sometimes depressing, book to read. <br /> <br />Potential readers should know that this is the fifth in a series of Kurt Wallander mysteries.  (There is likely to be a Comment under this review with a list of Wallander books in chronological order.) Although each stands on its own as a self-contained story there is a lot of subtext that may be lost on readers who read the books out of order.  Mankell's characters and their relationships with each other evolve over time.  I suggest that anyone interested in this series start of with the first book, Faceless Killers, before picking up Sidetracked.  Some books in the series are more entertaining than others but I don't regret having read the first five books.  Recommended.  L. Fleisig <br />
0743289412|3.0|Lisey Landon - is living in the shadow, albeit it gratefully, of her marvelously gifted writer husband.<br /><br />When he dies she does not have much idea what to do with herself.<br /><br />There are things and places he showed her that gave her reason to believe in the magical.  Without him theres only bad things.  Like the 'Incunks' who want to rifle his papers and take any unpublished treasures.<br /><br />Theres one such guy who is utterly deranged, and dangerous!  Life before believe or not did prepare her in an extent to deal with the psycho, she had once seen her husband shot in a parking lot by a crazed fan.<br /><br />The madman wants the paperwork and archives for the local university library, because, well, we are left guessing that Scott Landon is his favourite author after he meets a guy from the university who moans about the widow Landon's reluctance to part with the countless treasures hes sure she has.<br /><br />Theres a lot more to it obviously. But it wasn't enough to enamore me to the tale.<br /><br />It follows her recall of Scott and his visits to the 'other world', the one were he says his tales come from, Boo-ya moon.<br /><br />It also follows what happened to his brother and father, and some stuff called 'bad gunky' that seemed like a human form of rabies that perhaps came from that other world.<br /><br />I think the most interestng character in the whole story was her sister Amanda and her crazy behaviour.  Genuine craziness, not the mental wanderings of a tortured, talented soul.  She felt more real than the other people in the story oddly enough.<br /><br />The thing to look out for is the sheer amount of what I dub 'Kinginese', words like 'Incunk' and 'smuck'. Theres a lot of it here, if you struggled with the amount of jargon in any of the last few of the 'Dark Tower' series then this is really going to upset you further.<br /><br />I'm glad I read it.<br /><br />It just didn't blow me away like 95% of Kings novels do, but, having said that, the guys allowed an off day.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore put together an excellent documentary on global warming.  It's convincing and easy enough for the average person to understand.  Anyone who lives on this earth should see it, whether you care about the environment or not.  What is sad is that everything he says is scientifically proven, yet the neo-cons will try to debunk this in name of corporate profit.
B00000ILDF|2.0|This is the perfect case of film companies wanting to squeeze out a little more money in a series no matter how bad the movie turns out. Alien 1 & 2 were great films, even watching them now years later I'm still on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br />I bought the big Alien DVD set and sat down to watch 3 last night for the first time, and I couldn't even finish it, it was just bad, terrible, stupid. The Alien name aside, this was a poorly done movie from all angles. Nothing made sense, it was goofy, acting was terrible (except for Sigourney and the doctor), and it wasn't the least bit scary.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After a tip from a friend who told me how excellent Firefly was, I told my TiVo to record all the episodes.  I figured I'd make a DVD of them, but this is a much better option: <br />- Excellent quality recording; looks almost like High Definition on my big screen HDTV. <br />- No commercial interruptions. <br />- Lots of extras. <br />- Good price.
B00005J8J6|3.0|If your looking for a better sounding remaster from the 2003 cd and already own the 1994 version, keep the 1994 version. There is little, if any, difference between the two. If you want the cool mini-lp packaging, get it, it's a real nice collectible.
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|After seeing this film so many times I can't remember, I'm still trying to look as cool as Richard Gere. Hey, the guy can dance...of course J Lo ain't too shabby either. Get this, you'll be calling the dance studio.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|Boston's 2nd release \\"Don't Look Back\\" with remastered sound. Wow, you can hear the sound quality improvement with this release. Better bass, volume, overall sound, like a well done job of remastering should sound like. We all know that their 1st album sold zillions and zillions of copies (like the one I own), and \\"Don't Look Back\\" is a distant 2nd in popularity, but in my mind, the rolls are reversed.
B000009EUM|4.0|Maybe Maybe was one of my favorites off this CD.  I thought it was a good follow-up album to Hunting High and Low.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|and when i say best, i don't mean spectacular or wow-special in any way except in the way it pins down the disfunction today's families seem to be caught in everywhere in the world.<br /><br />i am not american, i dont have a suicidal uncle or kinky gandpa, yet i could relate to characters' weirdness and their utter dysfunction as a family. i was like, oh my good, this is MY family :)<br /><br />today's way of life has shaken the foundations of a family, and this shaken structue keeps trodding on, until when?<br /><br />also a not so funny picture of america's vast number of.. should i say DISENLIGHTENED population, uneducated, caught in weirdo rituals like kids' beauty paegants (oh, aren't those candy store for pedophiles!!).. frankly, that was too scary (and i believe it was intended as criticism of weirdo stuff you yanks do) until it was brilliantly counterbalances by the oddness of a lil girl putting up a strip dance show :)<br /><br />too weird, too funny, but with a happy end.<br /><br />enjoyed it heaps :)
B000002L7Y|4.0|This is a great CD.  Even back then they were ahead of their time.  Great songs on this one.  Made me love the band's music.  I've been hooked for over 20 years!
0385474547|5.0|It is a beautiful piece of writing. Even though, the main character, Okonkwo, seems to be a mean and a tough guy from the outside; he still holds his passionate beliefs about his own tribe tradition. One thing he might have done immorally wrong is when he kills his step-son, Ikemefuna. But it is not only his fault because the tribe's leaders are involved in wanting to get rid of the boy. Another immoral example is the abandonment of twins. I believe that there is no culture that is better than others, but in this case, killing the innocents is not a moral thing. I do not agree with the tribe tradition of believing in evil sprits in the twins. I think the story is heart touching. Okonkwo who tries to fight for his beliefs and his tribe's values and traditions. They may not develop great economic stragegies or great innovations, but they are living in a spiritual way without damaging too much of the environment. Different people have different values of life.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|There are some really, really good songs on this CD.  Even my young daughter likes to listen to it instead of wanting to watch a DVD when we're in the car. Love it!
B000F39M9W|3.0|Good sound, but the fastest paced \\"Rite\\" I have ever heard.  It loses the dramatic effect for me when a piece of music is played at such breakneck speed.  Impressive musicians to keep up this speed of tempo.
1400044162|4.0|Ms. Adichie takes on a world she didnt experience directly, events that are bigger than her and yet she somehow succeeds at mastering them and taming them with mere written words and I owe her a debt of gratitude.    It is an epic fictional tale of events that took place amidst the real Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970). Like Chimamanda, I am Nigerian, I am Igbo, I should be Biafran. Biafra is a never talked about portion of Nigerian history. It is like a bad word, an open festering sore, unspoken about in mainstream Nigerian politics and history. Shame. I myself knew little of it despite having a father who fought in the war and a mother who survived it. Chimamanda who is my contemporary brought it to life for me.     The book follows the lives of several characters, their relationships to one another, and their lives before, during and after the war.  It also tell us the background of the War; it's colonial and ethnic beginnings.    I imagine that the writer must have been overwhelmed at times while writing this book. It must have taken a lot of courage to write about something so painful and so personal but I fancifully or truthfully think that like Frodo's Ring, it was her burden to bear and mine as a reader to share. I'm a lesser form of Sam Gamgee.    I also really love the names of some of her characters. It reminds me of the beauty of the variety of the Igbo. Iam Igbo and yet have never heard of those names. They must have been specific to the writer's state of origin/dialect.    A magnificent book and yet I only give it 4 stars out of 5. Why?    Because at times, some things and characters just stick out of place like a compound fracture, throwing the story slightly off course and giving it a vague air of contrivance. Or maybe, it is the reflection of wartime. Things dont always make sense. I'm not going to give examples as it is my own opinion which you may not share and I wont give away any spoilers.      Also, I am fiercely loyal to Kambili of 'Purple Hibiscus'. That book just means so much to me because in many many ways, I am Kambili.    All I can say is that the writer displays her impressive versatility because this book is nothing like her debut novel. Also, she tackles the psychological aspects of her story quite admirably.  I like the ending. It is not false and I like the open endedness that is sad but true, reminiscent of her previous novel. It couldnt have ended any other way.    You will not soon forget the major chracters (Olanna, Ugwu, Odenigbo, Baby) and some minor ones (Nnesinachi, Anulika, Mrs Mokelu). Adichie is a wonderful storyteller and I will always read her stuff.

B000H5TVJY|4.0|In a word, theatre.  A bit of dirt, a touch of grain, some obvious edge enhancement at times, even somewhat muted contrast but still nice if flat coloring, great flesh tones, and plenty of detail gives this blu-ray transfer a night at the local cinema feel.  I didn't mind it.  Not that this type of transfer should be encouraged but given the material I sort of liked the look.  Reminded me of when I used to go out to see a movie.  Truth be told the print used needs some cleanup and titles needing some cleanup should get it before going HD.  My rating is a little generous but given the film's setting of the decadent 80s the weathered megaplex look, even if due to lack of care, worked rather well.    (PS3 - 1080p projector - 92\\")
B000K4WPCC|4.0|Was this movie awesome?..No! Was this movie bad?..No! This movie isn't the best movie ever made, but it was entertaining for me to say the least. In a world where Hollywood's idea of entertainment is to keep reproducing movies that are either remakes, sequels or teen comedies is where \\"The Covenant\\" comes in. The actors are young and hot, but not so sugary and bubblegum that they make you sick. The story was new and original with amazing special effects to match.  I can't say enough good things about this movie. I just know that I'm sick of either movies that are either remakes, comic books, disgusting and bloody, or either there are too many sequels to care about what happens next. Don't get me wrong, when I first started watching it, I was like great this is gonna be an old \\"Backstreet Boys\\" video meets \\"Charmed\\", but you have to give it a fair chance to really get into it.
0792165020|5.0|A sleek, sexy, suspenseful gem!   <br /> <br />The haunting score had me hooked by the opening credits, and the film's momentum kept me glued to the edge of my seat to the very end.  If you're looking for a thriller packed with action and gore, this probably isn't the film for you.  But if you're in the mood for a masterful script, radiant cinematography, subtle & engrossing acting, and a sexy-cool storyline that will leave you wanting more, you've found your film.
B00005JOCU|5.0|I only have 2 names that come to mind when I think of this movie...Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy, or should I say, \\"Effie White\\" and \\"Jimmy Early\\". Those 2 made this movie. Let me just start by saying that Beyonce' who plays \\"Deena Jones\\" may as well have played her real life story. A story about a woman with less talent and better looks being placed as lead singer in a group where the talent is in the back where the looks aren't as important. Not to say that Beyonce' isn't talented, but Destiny's Child fans know what I mean. Anyways, that's another review though. Really, this movie is really about achieving your dreams no matter the cost. It chronicles the rise and fall of a female group of friends from stardom to their downfall when appearances seem to matter much more than real talent does. My girl Jennifer Hudson proves that she not only has the vocal talent, but the girl can act too. An Oscar for her would be well deserved, as well as Eddie Murphy who makes you laugh one minute, and feel incredibly sorry for him the next. Needless to say, I loved everything about this movie, and if I could give it 10 I would.
B000LE1FAY|5.0|Ok, now I must admit that LYLBF, Real, and AWAAM will always be pop masterpieces so I was truly leary of this one. She has kind of taken a negative attitude toward pop music and my philosophy has been that pop put them where they are today and I wish they would occasionally think of the fans that put them there. I have been waiting 10 years for an album from that amazing voice. It's not like 1 or 2 or 3 years but TEN. That's a long time. This truly is an amazing cd, I do miss the pop edge and the great choruses she is known for. The amazing hooks that she always left with us. Yet, each song has such a twist and is a finely crafted album. It probably won't leave my Ipod for a long, long time. It's refreshing to hear actual keyboards and guitar in today's pop scene. <br /> <br />Pourtant Tu M'aimes is my favorite and of course La Vie En Rose is true Belinda.  <br /> <br />Very, VERY, well done and her voice is better than ever! Please don't make us wait another 10 years for such a talent.  Vous faites la musique comme une vraie etoile Belinda!
B000ICL3KG|3.0|I don't have a beef with Al Gore's message.  Rather, I wish I had been able to see his presentation from start to finish without the \\"documentary\\" injections to this film that seek to augment factual presentation with emotional string pulling.<br /><br />Emotional string pulling shouldn't be involved in a documentary about global warming; it breeds cynics.  We need more facts (and there were a lot more that could have been presented) and fewer irrelevant side-stories meant to make the viewer go, \\"oooo\\" or \\"awwww\\".<br /><br />I suppose if you know someone who doesn't really care about global warming and has the attention span of a flea, this video could be a good launching point to get them thinking about the subject.<br /><br />If you're already thinking about the subject, skip this movie and do your own research online.  Go to wikipedia and spend 15 minutes reading global warming articles and you'll know more than the people who watched this film.

B000KCHZK6|2.0|I eagerly awaited the release of this CD but was sadly disappointed by the somber somewhat downbeat tone of the songs.  I kept thinking \\"maybe the next song\\" will pick up but, no luck.  I listen to Norah Jones as a melodic, relaxing respite from an otherwise hectic day.  I didn't get that on this CD.
0767830555|5.0|I watched this film again recently and find it remarkable it has held up as well as it has. It seems as though it could have been made last year, so timeless is this film. Robert DeNiro is simply perfect as Travis Bickle and I certainly enjoy the terrific performances by Shepherd, Foster, Keitel, et al. This is my favorite Scorcese film and his work here shows why he has earned his reputation as one of the medium's elite filmmakers, while Paul Schrader's script leaves an indelible mark. I think the film, however, would not be the complete masterpiece it is without Bernard Herrmann's music. The man behind the music of \\"Citizen Kane\\" and so many Hitchcock films, including \\"Psycho,\\" delivers yet another unforgettable musical score that marries so perfectly with its film. The resulting combination of all these facets is a work that really strikes a chord with me. Yes, it is violent and some of it could be seen as shocking or disturbing; yet, for those who identify with its portrayals of alienation and morality, and who find its style engaging, this film represents a pinnacle in cinema. The collector's edition DVD has some documentary material and the transfer is very good. There are also some extraordinarily unusual subtitles choices.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie is a combination of \\"Message in the Bottle\\" and \\"Frequency\\", both very good movies.  I love way two people can meet through letters and seem to know each other better then someone they know personally.  Also the fact that no fate is set and that messages from the future can help people form the past live on to see their future that they didn't see the first time in history. <br /> <br />If you have love in your heart and want to believe that we can influence our past and this is the movie for you.  You might need a few tissues if you are soft at lovely endings. <br />
B000E5N62U|5.0|Give this one a chance, I remember back in 77 when we first opened the Aja album, wondering if it was gonna be any good. A friend of mine just asked me to borrow my Morph the Cat CD, he asked me what the \\"good tracks\\" were. Honestly since it's release I had shelved it for a while and kind of forgot about it. So before I lent it to my friend, I gave it another listen. So as far as the good tracks, my advise to my friend(s)\\"start with track one and relax\\"

B000FWHVKA|5.0|Silent Shout deserves to be in the company of such groundbreaking electronic albums as #1 by Fischerspooner and Mezzanine by Massive Attack. Simply put, this is an amazing album from beginning to end. I will admit that I wasn't so enthralled with it on the first, second, or even third listen, but right now I'm absolutely loving it. If you're like me and you didn't get it on the first listen, give it some time and I promise you won't be disappointed. It's a shame that this album will stay largely under the radar. The masses don't know what they're missing.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Scary, spooky, edge-of-your-seat, eerie, suspenseful show. Supernatural takes on subjects of urban legends, lore- anything that goes bump in the night and uses those nightmares to create \\"real-life\\" battles of good versus evil (creatures of darkness-demons/ghosts/zombies etc).  The special effects are impressive for a TV show.     It's riveting to watch; most times you can't imagine just what exactly is coming.  Season 2 is shaping out to be just as good.  The chemistry between the brothers is amazing- the comedic timing and overall combative relationship often results in hilarious laugh-out-loud moments.  Classic moments like Dean's fear of flying are played off perfectly; you can't help but chuckle over their antics.      Even though I've already seen all the episodes, the show is entertaining enough to watch more than once.  The special features, though, are what really make the purchase worthwhile (at least for me).  They showcase the on-screen and off-screen antics between the two star characters (played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles).  They do the commentary on one episode and literally talk all the way through the whole episode- but it's ok because it's funny.  They seem to get along just as well off-screen as they do on.  Though, the bloopers and a day in the life of Jared and Jensen are my favorite- so ridiculous, it's hilarious!      And for an added bonus- the fact that it stars two very cute guys doesn't hurt.. =D      Overall a must-see show, don't miss out!
B000M06K5C|2.0|I'm not going to devote a lot of time to this review, because Bloc Party didn't devote a lot of time to their new album. I will say that the people who gave this album 5 stars are in denial and in a couple months they'll be using this CD as a drink coaster. How bad is this CD? Well, I'll be selling Bloc Party concert tickets if that's any indication.
B000M4RG42|5.0|I thought it was fine work by Eastwood, I can understand why some people thought it flwaed, but it didn't bother me in the least. I though Adam Beach did a wonderful job as Ira and the battle scenes were amazingly well done. It may not have been quite as good as Saving Private Ryan but I'd put it right up there with Band Of Brothers.     My only complaint...Where are all the special features, there should tons with a movie like this! Maybe when the release the DVD pack with Letters from Iwo Jima they will add some goodies to go along.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Keira Knightly gives the character of Lizzie the perfect passionate spark that you can feel for yourself when reading the novel.  I've seen quite a few movies from Jane Austen's works, most of which have turned out less than memorable, but this one is amazing.  If you enjoy this I'd suggest watching Kate Winslet & Emma Thompson in Sense & Sensibility.
B0004Z33G4|3.0|Nice box if you want to have all Rambo's movies but don't buy for the MetaStuff. This extra is far from being impressive and when I've tried to watch them on my computer, it's just frozen it. I was really disappointed as well as for the alternate ending in the first Rambo. If you already have the movies, don't waste your dollars on this box.
0743270754|5.0|Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin has written a very readable and sumptuous account of Lincoln's skillful management of the personalities that made up his cabinet during the Civil War.  The narrative revolves around the presidential election of 1860 in which Lincoln's three main rivals in the Republican nomination ultimately, and sometimes inspite of themselves, become his closest associates.  What is interesting about this work is the huge cast of characters.  Not only are there finely drawn portraits of rivals Edwin Stanton, Samuel Chase, and Edward Bates, but also of their surrounding family members.  It seems that all these myriad characters wrote copious diaries and letters, and that Goodwin sifted through thousands of pages personal correspondence.  The result is a very original piece of research that extends well over 900 pages.<br /><br />Seward, Chase, and Bates were the three frontrunners in the 1860 Republican primaries, Lincoln was a distant fourth.  They were all better educated, held higher office, circulated in higher levels of society, and had more money.  And Lincoln, who was a prairie lawyer from the \\"western\\" state of Illinois, was notable only for having lost two elections and having staked out a rather moderate stance towards slavery in his debates with Stephen Douglas.  Yet Lincoln's rivals, because they were well-known, had many enemies.  Lincoln played up his outsider status and threw in some homespun campaign slogans such as \\"Honest Abe\\" and \\"Rail-Splitter.\\" The electorate was swayed and handed him a victory.<br /><br />Before he was faced with the task of saving the Union, he needed to save the Republican Party.  His rivals were humiliated that they had lost to a country bumpkin and wanted no part of him.  Appointing them to his cabinet was a stroke of genius that carried some risks.  Seward became Secretary of State, Chase became Secretary of Treasury, and Bates became Attorney General.  A fourth rival Simon Cameron became Secretary of War.  During this period, it was not unusual for cabinet memebers to upstage their president and carve out patronage fiefdoms for themselves.  Lincoln calculated that he could better control their activities if he worked closely with them.  To balance out the antagonists, he added two loyalists, Gideon Welles as Sectretary of Navy and Montgomery Blair as Postmaster General. The mix of personalities with Lincoln's guidance worked famously well.<br /><br />Lincoln proved to be a very strong leader - some would even say tyrannical - and won the grudging respect of his former rivals.  The most difficult member was Chase who repeatedly threatened to resign when he didn't get his way.  Lincoln finally called his bluff and let him resign.  Chase, however, was a key member of the Radical Republicans who argued that Lincoln was too soft on slavery. (Chase was also notable for getting his face on the $10,000 bill.)  Not to let them become members of the opposition, Lincoln eventually appointed Chase as Chief Justice. Another stroke of genius.<br /><br />If there was one thing that set Lincoln apart as a strong leader, it was his singlemindedness of purpose.  It was preserving the Union at all costs; abolishing slavery always came second.  Even though during the war he declared martial law, suspended habeous corpus and arrested over 18,000 opponents, he was still credited and adulated for achieving his ultimate goal.  Moreover, his views toward slavery also evolved greatly during the war leading to the Emanicipation Proclamation in 1863 and finally to the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery altogether. And in the end his assassination was the apotheosis of his greatness making him a martyr at the height of his popularity.od, it was not unusual for cabinet memebers to upstage their president and carve out patronage fiefdoms for themselves.

B00004STPT|4.0|The score for \\"Gladiator\\", all recognition for the film aside, is beautiful and stands on its own as a work of beauty and scope.  The score won a Golden Globe for Best Score, recognition that was deserved.  The score is very period-evoking, reflecting many similarities to Gustav Holst's \\"The Planets\\", a classical work.  Hans Zimmer borrowed heavily from the feel of \\"Mars\\", the second movement in \\"The Planets\\".  The feel is absolutely perfect for the battle scenes in \\"Gladiator\\", but the highlight is in the ethereal, gorgeous music with Lisa Gerrard's voice.  The end of the soundtrack stands out especially, ending with the semi-modern \\"Now We Are Free\\".  \\"Gladiator\\" is an investment that should be on the top of the list of film music lovers and \\"Gladiator\\" fans alike.

0486211045|4.0|This is a good quick reference guide and is easy to read as is all of Bridgman's books. The Complete Guide to Drawing From Life is more indepth and might be better if you want a little more explaination.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|As a middle-aged cinephile I'm saying a lot when I say that this is the most moving and most wonderful film that I have ever seen. It will survive as long as there is a thinking and intelligent audience for fim. Definitely one to have on DVD as it becomes richer with each viewing. I noticed so much more the second time I saw it; from the sheer poverty of these two young guys; with Ennis saving his half smoked cigarette and worrying so much about the loss of a shirt and Jack Twist's tough home background. Exceptionally good performances all round - fantastic direction, writing and music. It's sad that its detractors  cannot relate to it's compassion and power . It was robbed of the best movie Oscar - but it's in very good company there. Would like to see a special DVD with the ORIGINAL trailer which was also exceptional. Don't believe the negative stuff about this movie - watch it and, if you allow it to, it could do what only the most powerful works of art can do - it could change your life.

1400032717|4.0|This is a well-written book, with a purpose. A view from the mind of an autistic teenager. I wonder how many of us have just a little of this ourselves. As a father of child with aspergers syndrom, i found this book enlightening, sad, and yet hopeful.  <br />After all the zaniness of this book, the residual effect is a feeling of curiosity and amazement at the human condition, even those of us who fancy ourselves as 'normal'.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|All four stories are worth revisting every year or so; the last in the series was a pleasant surprise as a preview to a very big star.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|Yeah it ranks up there with the WRAITH-however doesn't have the same caliber actors.  Still it doesn't let you down!  All teh great 80's styles can be seen in here from clothes to hair and personality.  You have the gear head who is TOTALLY into his car that ends up being the hero with his NY accented sidekick who adds colorfully to the comic relief.  <br /> <br />A FAVORITE of mine, though not as popular as Weird Science.  I don't care-it is just as good!

0743233832|5.0|This book must be read by everyone. It is so easily digestible and immediately applicable. This translation does an excellent job in translating the words of Marcus Aurelius to a modern audience. Meditations, the original text this book is based on, shows how common it is for people to make their lives unnecessarily complicated and how easy it is to live a simple life.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|What has made her other albums so amazing was her ability to \\"be\\" the song; to \\"feel\\" the song -  to attach herself to the understated emotion of the songs and deliver more than just a song.<br /><br />This is where \\"Not Too Late\\" falls short.  Most of the songs are standoffish, not really saying anything, and her vocals are just sort of meandering around the music.  She sings these songs from an objective observers stand point and it seems as though she has no real connection or opinion of any of them.  Even her political song seemed like it was written just for the sake of writing a political song, I believe she neither agrees or disagrees with what she is singing about.<br /><br />However, the songs as just songs, aren't bad.  She ventures into Tom Waits territory with Sinkin Soon and enlists the aid of M.Ward to help her carry it through.  The songs are not bad, but the stuff that blows me away is the stuff that displays an unbridled passion, an emotion that is unmistakable, and this album didn't quite have it.<br /><br />It is what it is.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|This complicated story was extremely well woven together. I only realized quite how well woven on the 2nd and 3rd viewing. I found that there were little touches that I had missed when I saw it for the first time (in the theater) but picked up later when viewing the DVD. A nice addition to any collection.

B000K7VHPU|4.0|I gave this movie four stars... starts slow actually boring, but pay attention and don't lose focus. I bought it and played it through my oppo dvd player with the samsung 56 inch 1080 p model hoping for a pleasurable viewing experience... the sound track is good, but the movie its self is dark and because of the era it was supposed to represent doesn't display well. The only thing that makes this movie good is the ending about ten minutes of it... all of the things that doesn't make sense while watching the movie comes together in the ending... a love story, drama and illusions makes it a four star movie...
B0009UVBQI|5.0|There is a local cable station where I live that, late at night, often shows these tedious kung fu films that I can only assume are or were the mainstay for Hong Kong, Taiwan and some main land China film goers. Most of the action is between one or two young assailants and one older defender made up to appear older with white hair, puffy eyebrows and beard.) Foley artists I expect were exhausted after adding loud snaps and bangs to every contact between the fighters who, except for an occasional flip or ricochet off a tree, are fairly earthbound. And it is impossible to deduce from their barely subtitled dialogue what they are fighting about. Also, these battles almost always take place in a forest or rocky glen. <br />Recent kung fu epics like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Hero; and House of Flying Daggers, to name only a few, have raised the bar both stylistically and in terms of production values. Stephen Chow, director and co-writer of Kung Fu Hustle, has taken the genre one step further: while keeping the high standards in fight choreography, special and trapeze effects, camera work and editing found in the aforementioned films, Chow produces an at first glance comedic kung fu movie that also incorporates American film genres, not only to inject this latter iconography into his story but also to expand the viewer's consciousness of the toll and meaning (or meaninglessness of) violence. It is obvious that Chow is an avid devotee of Hollywood: he appropriates 1930s musicals a la Fred Astaire in the dance Axe Gang leader Brother Sum and his mob do in their stronghold. Pig Sty Alley is a Chinese version a Bowery Boys back alley. Music, both traditional Chinese string orchestra and snippets from Western classical violin concerts, is used as a continuous underscore. And the physical comedy employed in the first half of the film - among them falls from buildings that do not injure, fist distorted features that snap back like rubber, running legs reduced to a cyclonic blur, people moved dozen of yards in less than a blink of an eye - all draw on Hollywood prototypes, especially the cartoons produced by Warner Brothers in the middle of the last century. <br />While the callous execution of a rival gang in the middle of the street has the expected comic twist and is nonetheless tolerated despite the carnage, the early death of the coolie, tailor and Donut the baker - the three initial defenders of the Pig Sty Alley - come, on reflection, as something of a shock. Who now is going to step up and defend Pig Sty Alley? The landlord and his wife come forward, revealing their mastery of the martial arts that is almost enough to conquer the Beast - almost, but not quite. Their salvation, and Shanghai's deliverance from the murderous tyranny of the Axe Gang is the transformation from street thug and gang wannabe (and secretly noble) Sing (played by director Chow) into a superfighter who finally vanquishes the Beast.  <br />Throughout, the most vicious and powerful kung fu attacks barely graze the combatants, which maintains the sense of comedy even while the good guys are dying. Chow plays with this violent-comic, good-evil dichotomy with a master's touch. And yet on reflection we realize that more than good entertainment is at stake here. The violence is neutralized by the comedy, and yet the characters, who are so well drawn by this talented cast and its director, are taken from us too soon. Kung Fu Hustle plays this crafty game with us: amazing us with special effects-enhanced fight scenes, making us laugh with well timed and conceived comic bits and pratfalls, but in the end leaving us with an odd dissatisfaction, as much with the film as with the genre. Hollywood inspired images transcend the nominal crudeness of run-of-the-mill chop-socky far, but also raise the stakes in that the characters gain dimension, and in doing so leave the view bereft by their passing. While being more cartoonish, Kung Fu Hustle becomes more real. <br />Hung Fu Hustle comes highly recommended, and we can only hope that its sequel, due out in 2008, lives up to the standards set by this imaginative and unsettling film.
B00005JMEW|5.0|When I first heard of the title of this movie, I thought that it would not be any good. Boy, was I mistaken! Not only only is it unique in its style, combining anime, black and white film, and colored images-- the music is pretty cool, as well. Tarantino did a great job bringing everything together. Uma Thurman, Vivica A. Fox, Darryl Hannah and Lucy Liu are outstanding. These ladies were tough and you could tell that they were physically fit for their roles. I loved this movie so much that I ordered Kill Bill, Volume 2, as well.

B000E41MRC|5.0|This film is an absolute must for any serious student of World War 2 or Nazi Germany or Adolph Hitler, or for any Christian as a study in false religions and idolatry, for that matter.  One cannot speak with real authority on the techniques of the Nazi Party without viewing this film, uninterrupted, at least once.  It is THE original political propagande film, the first ever made, and has more lessons to teach than can be listed here.  This disc is well done, clear with subtitle options that are useful;  the subtitles have been slightly reworded from the first English language translation dating back to the film's original release, but is still effective true to the spirit of German original.  Excellent.
B000IJ79WU|1.0|Bottom line is the original cut of the film is a far superior film than Mr. Doner's cut.  All due respect his way because I absolutely loved the first film.  There were a few things I liked in this film, one was that the \\"mute\\" kryptonian bad guy really is mute in Donner's cut, Thank God.  Other than that I did NOT like the alternate takes of Reeve, especially the final scene of Superman and Luthor. It seems Superman is practically amused by Luthors almost successful plot to kill him and rule the world.  And by the way, what happens to Luthor after Supes destroys the fortress? In the original cut, not only was the Fortress NOT destroyed, Supe flies Luthor out, but in this one nothing doing, I guess Supe decided to \\"ice\\" him, but it's okay, we'll just do the \\"time travel\\" thing, hey it worked last time right?<br /><br />I would have throughly enjoyed the alternate takes as deleted scenes on some kind of special edition of Superman 2, and perhaps two director commentaries, one from Lester and one from Donner, or perhaps the two of them together? And some kind of interview/documentary on the whole drama surrounding Donner's replacement on the film and the \\"underground\\" alternate cut.  I can't believe this made it to the shelves, it turned a great sequel into a farce.
B00008RH3L|4.0|Miller's Crossing is the Coen Brother's foray into the gangster genre.  Most people either love the Coen Brother's movies or hate them.  I fall somewhere in between, however, their movies are always interesting and Miller's Crossing is no exception.   <br /> <br />The film takes place in a prohibition era, large, American city.  The protagonist, Tom Reagen, played by Gabriel Byrne, is the trusted right-hand man of Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney), the leader of the dominant Irish gang.  Leo is under pressure from the up and coming Italian gang led by Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito).  A conflict between the two leaders emerges over the small time hood, Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro).  Apparently Bernie is leaking word of Caspar's fixed races to too many people.  Caspar is seeing the odds of his sure bets drop too much.  It's cutting heavily into his cash flow.  And besides, it's just not ehtical.  Leo, partly because Bernie is his girlfriend Verna's (Marsha Gay Hardin) kid brother, is protecting Leo and refuses to let Caspar move against him.  The police and mayor take orders from whoever the top dog is, and the funniest moments of the movie are watching them shift around in trying to end up on the right side of the ensuing war.  Tom has to act on his own to bring his boss Leo and Verna, with whom he's having an affair, safely through the war. <br /> <br />It's a complicated plot, but the plot isn't the strongest aspect of the film.  What I found most remarkable about the film was it's attention to detail.  As a period peice, Miller's Crossing is phenomenal.  The costumes, the settings, the cars all perfectly fit 1920's urban America.  And the dialouge, what a wealth of character 1920's, American slang brings to the movie.  The acting by the whole cast was particularly well done.  And the cinematography captured it all perfectly.  Especially the lonely road through the woods at what was called Miller's Crossing.  This movie is truly a feast for the eyes, and the dialouge andsoundtack make it a feast for the ears as well.  The plot is a little too complex and Tom Reagen rolls from beating to beating like an indestructable Superman, but as a period piece, this movie excels. <br /> <br />Add in a little trademark Coen dark humor and a little Coen fixation with hats, and this movie is well worth a couple of hours of a quiet evening at home.

B00005JMFQ|4.0|I saw it first on TV and I was so intrigued by the concept that I watched it fully. At the end, I was amazed. For once, all the stories didn't end in a good way, which is rare. The movie shows all the kind of love you can feel (for you brother, for your co-worker, for your family, ...). It's a very good Christmas story, and even if at some point you can think the movie is a little cheesy, well, at the end, you just feel good and full of love to share. <br />The actors are all very good british actors, which make the film even more intense. Well, if you're feeling down, just watch love actually. <br />Oh by the way, the story with Colin Firth is one of the best. Just watch it.

I put the book down because at first it didn't appeal to me, but then, frankly, I couldn't find anything else so I picked this up. It looked okay, just not stellar. I was wrong. This is one of the best written and most interesting books I've read in a very long time. The background for the book is very interesting, and how Scalzi makes a contrast of the Earth and \\"beyond\\" Earth is extremely well done. Read this book.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Through the mist in medieval England is the sound of hoof-beats.  Horsemen are approaching!  Regaled in armor and accompanied by banners and porters, what a fine sight to see.  However, you quickly realize that there are no horses.  Are those coconuts?  Yep, they sure are.  \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" is unlike any movie you have ever seen before, and quite likely will ever see again (unless some fool attempts to do a remake).<br /><br />This movie has made several lists of the greatest comedies of all times.  Yet, not every one thinks the movie is funny.  People who like the Monty Python television shows, who like British humor in general, and prefer wry or ironic humor will find this movie funny.  Forget about slapstick.  This movie has very little slapstick.  Occasionally the jokes fall flat.  However, when the jokes work, they are hilarious.  Countless numbers of people have repeated the jokes from \\"The Holy Grail\\" in the three decades plus since the original release of the movie.<br /><br />Here are some samples of the humor.<br /><br />The lads are traveling through a forest when they meet the fearsome Knights Who Say Nee.  As an aside, I have seen the spelling \\"Nee\\" and \\"Ni.\\"  I am clueless as to which is correct.  The Knights Who Say Nee demand tribute from our heroes so that they may pass.  The tribute shall be...a SHRUBBERY!  Yes, a shrubbery.  How fortunate that our questing heroes soon encounter a shrubber (supposedly a man who creates shrubberies).<br /><br />In yet another scene we meet a most horrific creature, capable of felling entire legions of men.  Yes, it is the fearsome Killer Rabbit.  This fearsome rodent will take some serious weaponry to conquer.  Until then, the buck tooth bunny bloodily makes short work of several knights.  How fortunate they have a holy hand grenade.<br /><br />Then there is the tale of Sir Lancelot.  Poor chaste Lancelot ends up in a castle filled with nubile young women who urge Lancelot to spank them.  How unfortunate that the prospect of being spanked sends them into bursts of enthusiasm.<br /><br />\\"The Holy Grail\\" contains numerous jokes that range from small to large.  Some of the humor pokes fun at nearly everything imaginable.  Religion gets lampooned numerous times.  Ignorance and fear of the unknown are also regularly parodied.  Scientists, Camelot, Knights, peasants, politicians, judges, and many others get varying levels of treatment; even a duck.  After all, not everyone can be thoroughly lampooned in a movie that is an hour and a half long.<br /><br />Much of the humor is subtle.  Much of the humor requires knowledge of various subjects to understand the irony.  There have been quite a few articles and summaries written regarding the humor in this movie.  If you wish to catch every single joke you should seek these references because there are so many jokes that it is easy to miss some.  I still pick up on new ones each time I watch the movie.<br /><br />Some people have stated this movie is slow.  I am clueless as to what these people mean.  I have to keep backing the movie up to be sure I catch the subtleties in some scenes.  There are places where I think the movie is too fast.  This movie offends some people.  There are certainly numerous opportunities to be offended.  If you are easily offended, do not buy the movie.<br /><br />Here is an interesting bit of trivia:  The profits from Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" album helped finance this movie.  The members of Pink Floyd were supposedly big fans of the television show.<br /><br />As with many comedy movies, this one will appeal to people that enjoy a certain kind of humor.  English humor is considered \\"dry\\" by American standards.  For \\"dry\\" you may read subtle.  Some jokes are easier to understand if you understand England, and particularly medieval England.  Other jokes are wonderfully ironic and require little more than an open mind and a broad sense of humor (think about the killer rabbit).<br /><br />Regardless of whether an individual viewer considers \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" to be funny, the movie continues to have a loyal fan base (myself included).  Every time I watch the movie I seem to see something different and enjoy the same jokes over again.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|. I love Dylan but he is, to some I think, an aquired taste. His work may take a couple of listens to take hold. This is one of those rare albums that grabs you the first time you hear it and quicky becomes a daily must play.  <br />  I think I was expecting a continuation of \\"Time Out of Mind\\" with that consistantly dark, moody, sound running through most of the songs. \\"Modern Times\\", however, is a great blend of \\"rock-a-billy\\" blues, classic Dylan (Workingman's Blues #2), moody love ballad (Nettie Moore,) and the exquisite \\"Spirit on the Water\\" that gives me a \\"Moonlight In Vermont\\" feeling. <br />
1582701709|2.0|This is a very pretty, well-packaged book, with plenty of influential folks giving their 2 cents. There is really nothing new that this book will tell you although it can be motivating and inspiring.  HOWEVER, I'm a little disturbed by the book's premise (law of attraction)--that you attract what happens in your life and that that it's absolutely your thoughts that create your reality.  Not wholly true. Particularly, regarding your health.  There is a section on how when you are overweight and can't lose weight, it's your faulty thinking that's causing this.  Basically, the writer acknowledges that you might have a disease like hypothyroidism but dismisses such diseases as causing weight problems.  To her, the disease is just a mask and you're causing your weight problems.  I know a woman who had a pituitary tumor which caused Cushing's disease and made her gain 95 pounds in one year, despite being on a diet of egg whites and salads.  UM, YEAH (sarcasm) I'm sure it was just her \\"thoughts\\" that caused her weight gain.  I think that there is a little bit of \\"blame the reader\\" in this book--if you're life isn't going the way you want, it's because of you! Imagine the person sexually abused as a child who reads this book, and thinks, I attracted this abuse in my life--which by the book's \\"Law of Attraction\\" would be the extrapolation.   There's too much magical and potentially psychologically harmful thinking in this book.  Read, enjoy it for what it's worth, but really don't put too much weight in it.

B000MGBSI0|5.0|Season 2 picks up where Season 1 left off, but takes off in an entirely new direction.  Gone are the mundane \\"after school special\\" lessons of the first season episodes.  Madness, murder, mayhem, and backstabbing abound as Billy, Alison, Amanda, Jo, Jake, Michael, Jane, and Matt try to live life.  The relationships between the characters become more complex.  Amanda moves from messing things up between Billy and Alison, to driving a wedge between Jo and Jake.  Alison and Billy become engaged, but as their wedding approaches Alison begins having horrible nightmares which lead to startling revelations about her father.  Jo's new beau, Reed, kidnaps her and she ends up having to kill him.  Michael and Kimberly become engaged and buy a beach house together; Michael \\"kills\\" Kimberly drunk driving, is blackmailed by Sydney into marrying her when she finds out, and later dumps Sydney when Kimberly comes back.  Kimberly comes back wrong though, and runs Michael down in Jane's car, framing Jane.  It's been years since I've seen this season so I don't really remember much about Jane's new relationship or what Matt did in this season (other than help Michael cover up his role in Kimberly's \\"demise\\").   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this season, as this is when the show became a \\"must-see\\" hit.  Also, Marcia Cross and Doug Savant (Desperate Housewives) and Courtney Thorne-Smith (According to Jim) aren't the only Melrose alum back on tv... check out the Courtney Cox show \\"Dirt\\" to see Grant Show (Jake on Melrose) in a very interesting role!

B000JLTRIG|5.0|I've read some negative reviews of Season 7, but I have to say it's one of my favorites.  After a lot of lighter, more comedic episodes in seasons 5 and 6, Season 7 returned the series to the darker glory days of seasons 3 and 4.  I loved the story arcs in the season, and the writing and direction were dead on.<br /><br />Season 7 picks up where season 6 ended; adult Chris is dead and Leo can't stop grieving and move on.  As his marriage to Piper continues to fall apart he is courted (in rather strange fashion) by Avatars (we saw them in Season 5 in the episode \\"Sam I Am,\\" where Paige is reunited with her real father, Sam)to change the world and end the struggle between good and evil.  Woven into this storyline are Paige's romance with the Avatar-obsessed Agent Brody (Kerr Smith) and Phoebe's romance with Les (Nick Lachey) and her sabbatical to find herself.  The Avatar story only lasted half the season but segued nicely into the rise of Zankou.  As Zankour terrorizes the sisters during the final half of the season in his quest for the Book of Shadows and the Nexus, Phoebe has a romance with an ex-demon and returns to school.  Paige decides running magic school isn't for her; she passes the baton to a newly mortal Leo and is thrust into double duty as a witch and a whitelighter.  Piper, after nearly dying, tries to rework her marriage to Leo, who gives up his powers to be with his family.
B000002H5I|5.0|Tracy Chapman exploded onto the scene in 1988 with her debut single \\"Fast Cars.\\" I was working in radio at the time, and recall when my Elektra rep told me she was going to send me something she knew I would love (she had a pretty good take on my personal taste). The CD single of \\"Fast Car\\" arrived, and it hit me like a sucker punch. The devastating lyric about social class and poverty entrapment was unlike anything on the radio at the time, and I knew it was something special. I am still proud to say that the station I worked for at the time was one of the very first to add the single to our playlist, and I had a platinum album of Tracy Chapman's debut in my office when the album hit number one.<br /><br />\\"Tracy Chapman\\" is one of those fantastic moments in popular music; when an artist emerges fully formed with a debut that is prescient and fearless. Chapman had both a husky voice and a strong sense of melody, and yet the social voice she invested into her songs stormed over the average easy-listening pop. Her vocal assault of \\"Behind The Wall\\" is stark and haunting, echoing the violence of the song's lyric. \\"Talking About A Revolution\\" went straight for a lyrical jugular, there was no passive resistance here.<br /><br />There was also a core of tenderness to be found here as well. \\"Baby Can I Hold You\\" was sentimental enough that Neil Diamond once recorded it. \\"If Not Now\\" is a plea to a lover to commit. And as a simple plea for peace amid the contradictions, \\"Why\\" is hard to beat. (\\"Why are the missiles called peace-keepers when they're aimed to kill?\\") Chapman also exudes confidence for the CD's 11 songs, enough that her notorious shyness is something you'd never guess at.<br /><br />\\"Tracy Chapman\\" re-zoned the playing field in 1988 and won Chapman a best new artist Grammy. It remains her best recording (even though all her albums have fine moments, this is the CD that every song is top-notch). The full digital recording was one of the first from the early days of the CD and still sounds incredible. All the way around, a classic album.early days of the CD and still sounds incredible.

B000784WMW|5.0|It is extraordinary reading the incredibly shallow reviews of people whose enjoyment of a film or TV show is totally limited to the superficial production values.  If your tastes are so shallow that you simply MUST have glitzy bells and whistles over substance, then I guess you can't watch any TV production made before 1990.  Yes, the BBC at the time had very few resources to work with -- that still makes the original FORSYTE SAGA (late 60s) absorbing entertainment for those whose imaginations are broader and deeper than those who require special effects and fancy hi-tech wizardry in their entertainment.  I guess these people can never watch theater where audiences are forced to use their imaginations far more than TV/film audiences are. <br /> <br />This production of JANE EYRE is the most richly satisfying of all.  Timothy Dalton simply IS Rochester, even tho he is too handsome for the character.  Zelah Clarke is little and plain just as the character is described in the novel.  Both deliver Bronte's language beautifully and naturally.  So much of the novel appears in this production, I think Charlotte Bronte herself would recognize her voice here.  The only thing missing is Bronte's focus on Jane's relationship to God--that is minimized here.  There is some superb acting and when it all finally ends, you wish it would just go on.  If you're an adult viewer who doesn't demand state-of-the-art production values, and whose imagination is rich enough to fill in the blanks and doesn't need everything spelled out for you---you will have no problem enjoying this version of Bronte's novel.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|My niece told me that this CD was wonderful and I (being a tad bit over 30) thought that it would be a bubble-gum type collaboration.  Wrong!

B0007R4TAS|4.0|Not the best version of the novel but certainly one of the best.  Scott and York are superb and the music is easily one of the most beautiful and memorable made for any TV film.  Scott brings an appropriate sense of danger and anger to the role while York makes Jane into a strong, thoughtful, intelligent woman instead of a mousy, passive servant.  I highly recommend this version, especially to those whose imaginations are broader and deeper than those who can't handle production values that are not state-of-the-art.
B00005JPDS|4.0|The Pursuit of Happiness is the true life story of Chris Gardner, who was a struggling salesman of medical scanners in the 1980s. His life hit the doldrums when his wife left him, and he has to take care of his young son. Soon he is evicted from his house and has to sleep with his son in a public bathroom (and later on homeless shelters). A small light at the end of the tunnel appears when he is accepted as an unpaid intern at a stock brokerage firm - he is one of 20 such interns, and only one will be chosen after six months to join the company in a lucrative job. Meanwhile, he has to make ends meet with his young son as he best can, facing debts, evictions, bills, etc. Some people criticize the movie as being too pro capitalist. There is some truth to that, as the rich guys who head the stock brokerage firm are shown to be all nice men, while the poor (with the exception of Chris) are bitter, resentful, unhappy with their lives. Yet, the movie also shows realistically what is to be a poor man in America as very few Hollywood movies do. All in all, a very good movie.

B000C65Z1G|1.0|This film had an interesting storyline, or so I thought. I gave it a shot one night with nothing better to do. I'm glad I didnt have anything better to do.  I shut this movie off about 3/4 of the way through which is rare for me. I usually see things through but this was killing me. The pacing was lost, the plot didnt know what to do, and the main character just didnt have seemingly any emotion or care as to what was going on. <br /> <br />The film starts with scenes from about halfway through the movie which is fine...but then the film repeatedly jumps forward and then backwards. Thats OK I guess but it has to be done right and this wasn't. There was a disconnect with the plot and nothing really advances. There was little or no build-up of suspense or real action. The main character just plodded along trying to piece together what happend to his wife which was entirely obvious from the get go unless you were born yesterday.  Except for one scene the main character didn't seem extremely distressed over the death of his wife, it was like \\"Yeah, thats too bad.\\"   <br /> <br />Also, the wife apparently had some affairs with one or possibly two other characters which of course now paints her as a canniving skank that deserves to get burned to bits. The \\"Evil corporation\\" card was being played here as well which most normal people are growing tired of. Honestly, a drug company doing tests on real humans and using them as guinea pigs right out in the open has a ZERO chance of happening so it was sort of unbelievable right from the get go. <br /> <br />For those that liked this film, hey whatever...to each his own. Some people commented on the beauty of the cinematography. Even that was somewhat underwhelming and even if it was really \\"pretty\\", there was little substance so that alone cannot make for a good film. <br /> <br />NOT recommended!!!
B0000029GA|5.0|Some people on here are reviewing this album using phrases like \\"overrated\\", \\"boring\\", \\"tracks sound the same\\". There is a reason why some of the best producers in the game in 1994 got together to hook Nas up with classic production. There is a reason why this album gained the first \\"5 Mic Rating\\" from The Source magazine. There is a reason why this album is constantly being discussed 13 years after it's release, always being hailed as \\"Classic\\". <br /> <br />If you consider yourself any type of fan of Hip-Hop/Rap, owning this album is a REQUIREMENT. Nas redifined lyricism with this masterpiece. The production on this album is timeless and the beats still haven't lost their touch even today. <br /> <br />If you have any doubts about this album, don't read the recent reviews. Set it to show the most helpful and read through those. To be perfectly honest, anyone telling you not to purchase this album truly knows nothing about Hip-Hop.

From the very outset, The Hives punch you in the face with a relentless stream of power-chords, pounding drums, and \\"screw you!\\" vocals.  The band let's you catch your breath for a moment on their rendition of \\"Find Yourself Another Girl\\" but then quickly resumes the onslaught before eventually finishing up with the catchy \\"Supply & Demand\\".  If you heard \\"Main Offender\\" and/or \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" and thought \\"Hey, this ain't too bad\\", then do yourself a favor and pick up Veni Vidi Vicious today.

The highlights are Let There Be More Light, Remember A Day, Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun, A Saucerful Of Secrets and Jug Band Blues. The other two songs I really don't care for.

B000K7VHQ4|2.0|Can a movie with a twist ending surprise me for once?  I suppose at this point in the wake of movies like The Usual Suspects, The 6th Sense, Fight Club, etc., our eyes and ears have been trained to catch the supposed \\"twist ending\\" before it happens.<br /><br />The Illusionist is based on a short novel by Steven Millhauser which Neil Burger carelessly adapted into a much longer than nesessary film.  It's painfully obvious that there is not enough material to fill an entire movie here so a lot of the scenes felt pointless and bogged down by lack of story.  First and foremost, The Illusionist is a love story.  Magic is just a secondary offering (for more magic and less love, see The Prestiege, but don't be surprised if you predict the ending).  Eisenheim and Sophie are childhood friends who fall in love, but he is a commoner and she has high stature so her family won't allow her to even be seen with him.  Skip ahead in time and Sophie is set to marry a crown prince while Eisenheim is a well regarged magician.<br /><br />The performances were all good, but not enough to save the material.  I always enjoy Ed Norton (Death To Smoochy being the exception).  Paul Giamatti surprised me as the inspector, because he left his mopey, sad sack image behind and actually played a character I had yet to see him play.  Jessica Biel was fine for what it was worth, and Rufus Sewell was good because I hated his unlikable character.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, the downfall of the movie comes when a supposed accident occurs and then Eisenheim begins performing the same trick over and over again for about 5 minutes at a time and then walks off stage.  I guess you had to be there because the audience members seemed to be amazed but I was waiting for something new to happen.  The movie then slowly drags its feet to the twist ending which felt like it was trying to be The Usual Suspects so hard, that it actually made me want to turn it off.<br /><br />Let's see if I can at least end this on a positive note.  The cinematography was really good.  Congratulations to Dick Pope.The cinematography was really good.  Congratulations to Dick Pope.
B000EK76K8|4.0|The converter is esssential for anyone who needs to use a second monitor for their imac. In my case, the imac is driving a 1080p HD display, and the video card does a fine job of running both simultaneously. The adapter plugs into the proprietary adapter on the back of the imac. Although technically not a review of the adapter, a larger question is why there couldn't be a standard DVI plug in the first place. The adpter plugs in without a satisfying click or other mechanical prop to help keep it anchored, and whether this is a feature or a bug, it comes out quite easily.<br /><br />Much has been made in other forums of the fact that the flavor of the connection is DVI-D, lacking the extra 4 pins to make an analog connection, but once you are aware of the limitation it doesn't make much difference. Most modern displays (NOT CRTs) can handle the digital interface. But if you are connecting the female end of the adapter to a DVI-I male connector, it wont fit, lacking both the four pin holes around the ground and supporting a narrower flat ground pin than the DVI-I connector.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|The Snowman is a true Christmas Classic in every sense of the term.  I personally have been looking for it on and off since the last time I saw it when I was about 10 or 11 (now i'm 20) and was overjoyed to find it here on Amazon. <br /> <br />The quality is much better than I would have expected for somthing of this age that doesn't have enough demand in the open market to warrant full restoration.  Watching it, the only way I could have guessed that it was as old as it is based on the content and quality of story that is so hard to find in modern childrens stories.  The movie itself has a very old world timeless feel to it that really creates a sense of nostalgia and contentment that I'm sure at least the latter of which would be felt by a viewer of any age.   <br /> <br />This past Chirstmas I watched it with my grandparents who had never seen it, and my mother showed it to her Pre-K class, who also had never seen it.  Both age groups (4-5 & 85+/-) found it unanimously enjoyable. <br />The only complaint I hear voiced from others in the online community is that this copy doesn't have the David Bowie intro that used to be shown on TV in America.  That is because this is the original British version with the intro by Raymond Briggs, the author of the story.  Now as a big David Bowie fan, I would sort of like to hear his intro (I can't remember it from my childhood) but I would never trade it for this original one with Raymond Briggs.  Mr. Briggs' voice and image really sets the mood in a wonderful tone that I can't imagine can be substituted by David Bowie, no matter how much I like him. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough for those of you who have vague recollections of it from your childhood, and I would recommend it even more strongly for parents of young children today.  Unfortunatly, this is no longer shown in America as far as I can tell, so it is very important that people keep this rich tradition alive and have a copy availible for theirchildren.  You and they will be very glad you did, this is a christmas special completely different than all others and in a class of its own.
B000M06K5C|5.0|UK quartet Bloc Party are back with their racing, pulsing guitars, skittery beats, and lead singer Kele Okereke's desperate delivery. On their sophomore disc, \\"A weekend in the city\\", they've crafted a set of tight, atmospheric, dancey songs which still manage to fit in their philosophical theme.<br /><br />The lovely \\"The prayer\\" is about a night on the dancefloor, a catchy danceable rocker, with electronic whirls and loops,<br /><br />\\"Hunting for witches\\" starts with what sounds like a radio being tuned, leading into a cutting guitar riff and an irresistible beat, which belie the nature of the lyrics; terrorism, with references to the London bombings, and 9-11, and the paranoia of everyday living.<br /><br />\\"Uniform\\" is a look at today's youth, all looking like clones, and seemingly impenetrable. It's a gentle song with jangly guitars and brooding backing vocals, and a tempo shift midway upping the beat. Brilliant!!<br /><br />\\"Where is home\\" starts off almost dirge like, before a staccato of skittery beats and fleeting machine gun-like guitars and dreamy backing vocals tell a story of the hardship (Black) immigrants face. \\"In every headline we are reminded that this is not home for us\\" Kele sings.<br /><br />Opening cut \\"Song for Clay (Disappear here) is a dance rocker, in the mould of Franz Ferdinand, or The Killers: Insistent drumming, sawing guitars, and a tempo shift from downbeat ballad (sung in a tremulous delivery), to upbeat rocker. It dares you not to move. Fantastic!<br /><br />The shimmery \\"I still remember\\" is a nostalgic look at a crush between two school boys.<br /><br />\\"Sunday\\" is rather melancholic, despite the drumming, with dreamy, soothing guitars and backing vocals, and a wonderful guitar break. Closing the CD is the tender ballad \\"SRXT\\" with an awesome guitar climax.<br /><br />While not as brash and immediate as its predecessor, it is just as ambitious, and shows growth in leaps and bounds.
B000006045|5.0|mezzanine is beautifully produced, mellow, dark and hard at times. it's a slow tempo, or down tempo, cd. there are several vocalist, a female and a couple of males, that all have their own unique voice. the voices end up adding so much texture to the already layered and chunky beats. everyone should have this one in their music library.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Yes, other reviews will be longer and more detailed.  However, I've been listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers literally since they started and seen them live any number of times over the years. <br /> <br />Yes, they are not the same group who recorded Freaky, Blood-Sugar, etc. etc.  Bands change with the people who are in them, and you either grow with them or you don't.  If you are looking for the Chili Peppers circa 1991 then look elsewhere. <br /> <br />But if you are looking for a diverse, enormously talented, funky, and damn smart band then ignore all the reviews, good and bad, listen to both disks and decide for yourself.
B000K7UBTI|3.0|Let me begin by stating it is long overdue for a film of this type to present 'Iron Man'. I was quite please with art work, and layout of many stories that could be followed if the DVD sells. It was so amazing to follow the transition of Tony Stark (Iron Man) as the story unfolds. It is an animated film though the details were so life like. I believe the film was made for the adults than the youth audience. That's my only disappointment was the fact my six year old couldn't watch it. The storyline has covered so many previous comic books plots to present the modern version of the Iron Man within 83 minutes. The film feature the many different suits as a reader would follow through the comic book trail. <br />The idea of magic VS technology was the perfect conflict for Iron Man. The ancient world VS the modern world. Awesome. Without giving away the story, Tony Stark's greatest invention could withstand the different climates, atmosphere and challenges that a man otherwise could not survive in. I truly believe this was a great introduction for better films on 'Iron Man' to come. <br />
0688145078|5.0|We bought this book when I was 6 months pregnant with our second child, when we started really talking about the baby to our son.  He's 20 months old now and says 'baby' and 'brother' when he brings us this book to read.  When you ask him if he is going to be a big brother, he enthusiastically responds 'Yes!'  I know it will still be an adjustment when we bring his brother home in a few weeks, especially since the entire concept is difficult for a toddler, but this book is very positive about how important the role of the older child is in the new family dynamic.
B000GUJF4G|4.0|I must say, I have a fascination with anything water based in movies. Titanic, Hard Rain, and now Poseidon. I'm actually shocking myself to say that Poseidon is rivalling Titanic in my eyes. But Titanic is my main love.<br /><br />I'd already seen The Poseidon Adventure, and Beyond The Poseidon Adventure, before I got to see this on HD, so I knew what to expect. I thought I'd feel some loyalty towards the original, but I was blown away by this, and to watch it on a massive screen AND in HD as well, words cannot describe the experience. The sound is absolutely amazing, we had to keep turning the sound down, in order not to frighten the neighbours, and the picture is beyond perfect. Honestly I can't rave about HD much more. I actually went out the next afternoon to buy the regular DVD to compare, but I just had to do the review first. I loved the movie that much that I would have bought it anyway.<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers that yes, the character development is not great, but I hope someday there will be a director's cut, as many of Fergie's scenes got cut. Fergie (or Stacy Ferguson if you prefer) was my one highlight of seeing this film - at the time I didn't realise Kurt Russell or Mia Maestro was in it - but I was disappointed to see she didn't have very much screen times. She's gorgeous, and has a gorgeous voice to match, but we didn't get to hear much of the latter either. I wish she could have shown off her acting skills by being one of the survivors. If only for a little while. My other very small problems with the movie were the loss of the Christmas tree, which played a pivotal role in the original. That should have stayed. The fact that not many of the passengers in the ballroom get a choice whether to go or not with the ragtag bunch of determined-to-escape passengers (Fergie, lift your feet and go!) I felt was also wrong. As they could have tried to escape. But then it did make for a spectacular scene, particularly when Fergie's character went over to the captain (I think?) and gave him a hug. That's when you know they know they have nothing left, but to surrender to whatever is about to happen.<br /><br />Also, some reviewers have complained about the fact that the scene with spotting the rogue wave on radar was cut. Why complain?! The director had to cut something to cut it down, it was probably unnecessary anyway, so it has to go. You have to be brutal. But this starts the sentimentality of the film - Richard Dreyfuss's character, alone at New Year, since his partner deserted him, is the first to spot the rogue wave, interrupting his impromptu suicide attempt. Believe me, if you're going to start crying at a film that was the point I nearly did! What a wuss.<br /><br />The rest of the cast were excellent though, my favourite was Mia Maestro, who I already knew from starring in Alias. She was the only person who stopped to help Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) & Chris (Mike Vogel), and her fear when they were trapped in that very small, and partly caved in air vent made me genuinely terrified myself. And let's face it, her cross necklace saved the day in the end!<br /><br />Most of the characters you will begin to warm to just when the ship capsizes in a few shocking minutes, when I swore I would never set foot on a ship again! There are the few stereotypical characters, mainly the Kurt Russell character, doing the overbearing and overprotective father routine on his daughter who's secretly engaged. The single mother & her son weren't given THAT much screen time - a lot of the others did get more - but the scene were she's on one side of a wall, and he's on the other, and it's slowly filling with water, will bring out the maternal side to anyone.<br /><br />Of course, with these films it's always a race against time, which is probably why I enjoy them so much. What's so original about this & funnily enough, the original is that the ship is capsized. Therefore, a million times the obstacles, and a REAL raceagainst time, and the rising water. (Plus I can't swim that well, so it makes it even more shocking.) Yes, some of the characters do die along the way (and there's a similar death to Shelley Winter's death from the original), and I did shed a little tear, at one particular character death. I had to hide my face behind the cushion I just happened to be clutching throughout most of the film. Some of the death scenes, albeit not gory, were very realistic, and the expressions on the characters as they died have left an impression on me. Elevators come crashing down (look out if you happen to be UNDERNEATH it at the time), people fall great heights, and bodies get burnt to a crisp. Nice images huh?<br /><br />I absolutely adore this movie, and eagerly await a possible director's cut, or a better special edition, with deleted scenes. There appear to be no deleted scenes featured on the HD, although it's not much of a loss, when you see what is on it. You're quite spoilt. Complete with an in movie experience, which I'm not sure about, as I think, as I do with commentaries, it could be quite irritating.<br /><br />This movie is now a major high up feature on my favourites list, and I'm so happy to actually own it myself. Even if it's not on HD. But I'll make do. I'll try and sneak the HD into the DVD player again soon.a REAL race against time, and the rising water.

B000001GXI|5.0|There are controversies over Roberta Peters' Queen of Night in this recording.<br /><br />True that there are many coloratura sopranos prancing around this role with sweet and lyrical interpretations. Either they do not care for the drama, or that they are vocally incapable of coming up with a 'big aria' that is fiery and energetic.<br /><br />Peters do not own a very big voice, but she did her best to give the role's due. If she had a slightly bigger voice, you would tell all the difference. She did not play it safe as with other coloratura sopranos, may be that was what Karl Boehm expected her to do - to give the character her due, instead of covering up the singer's vocal inadequacies (if there be any) by a 'pleasing' performance. With a Tamino sung in such a 'big' way as Fritz Wunderlich here, we have reasons to believe that Boehm wanted all his cast to stick to Mozart's requirements in their portrayals of their respective roles.<br /><br />Fischer-Dieskau of course gave a high-scoring performance in this respect. So did Franz Crass and James King and Talvela.<br /><br />Another very outstanding performance in this recording is Lisa Otto's Papagena. You have to hear it to believe it. Her duet with Fischer-Dieskau is simply stunning.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have to admit that not all the music in \\"Wicked\\" strikes a chord with me.  However, when I saw the play in London, and Idina Menzel came out on stage as Elpheba (sp?) the Wicked Witch (or as I prefer, the \\"Green\\" witch), I knew I had to have her music with me.  She and Kristin Chenoweth are amazing together and add some real emotion to their performances.  I have no problem visualizing the play while listening to this.  My children love this soundtrack and now know the whole story, even though they haven't seen the play. <br /> <br />Just a few notes:  I can't stand Bok's voice in any of the numbers he performs in; the prince Fiero is good, but sometimes gets a little to poppish for my tastes; \\"I'm not that Girl\\" and \\"No Good Deed goes Unpunished\\" sung by Idina are moving masterpieces and a bit more serious to counterbalance some of the silliness on the soundtrack. <br /> <br />Pick this one up, you won't regret it - and then go see the musical.

B00001OH7M|5.0|This is one of David's favorite works of mine.  Every song has words that make you think about life and God and what we should and should not be like.  The music is inspiring and lifts you up.  The songs start out calm and then lift you up.

B000JVT092|4.0|I love the movie, I love HD DVD, but I can't stand the dual format packaging.  The sole reason for purchsing the HD DVD version (or any HD DVD for that matter) is to watch it in high-def.  So why would I want to pay extra for the tacked on standard definition version, especially when there are already multiple SD versions on the market?
B00011RPB0|5.0|Some films don't need to be great for traditional reasons.<br />This is one of those films.<br /><br />One of the most magical things about this film is how Tokyo shines brightly throughout the film.  The dialogue, the music, everything moves slowly at a deliberate pace. The viewer is able to really take in the city that surrounds the characters. Sofia's Coppola direction almost seems delicate. Much of the soundtrack underscores the precise rhythms of the city. The dialogue between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson accent the visual tapestry like remembering a dream, half phrases, knowing looks and whispered tones.<br /><br />Lost In Translation  gives a fleeting glimpse into an intriguing city and its very interesting world.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />-EveningOcean CD \\"The Attraction\\" Evening Ocean com<br />[[ASIN:B000GL196M THE ATTRACTION]]
B000M06K5C|4.0|Bloc Party, Bloc Party,Bloc Party...That's all that seemed to be heard from Great Britain when the band came out with its debut album. For me personally I couldn't help but wonder why. I own Silent Alarm and yeah it's good but in a 3star kind of way. It's one of those albums that you get for the six excellent songs and the rest you care nothing about or for that matter remember. I personally don't think their debut was all that great. But one thing it DID do was leave more than enough room for improvement the second time around. One thing right off the bat that I noticed in A Weekend In The City is how much more organized it is. This is a good thing. I don't care if you're post-punk, rap, or even opera, organization is key to a solid record. Silent Alarm sounds like it should be great after the first two songs but for me it just never takes off and seems more thrown together than anything. Their new album however is nearly perfect in its arrangement of songs and overall structure. Bloc Party I'm pleased to say, have gone epic and what comes out is pure ear candy. The rapidness of the songs is still there but more importantly they all go as far as they can which is what bands should attempt to make happen. Why settle when you can go all out? One of Bloc Party's Themes seems to be the fact that a lot of society today takes things for granted so I personally take their ambition on this record as following what they preach and making what they do count. On Silent Alarm, when certain songs were arragned correctly magic happened. But unfortunately for that album it was very rare. On AWITC you hear in each song the work that has meticulously been put into each. There are so many surprises that it may take a few listens to fully absorb what the album has to offer but you definitely get your money's worth. The thing I think I'm most proud of Bloc Party for is that they have centered their focus a little more this time, particularly in their lyrics. Silent Alarm has huge hints of liberalism within the band where many references are made some believing to President Bush though (according to Wikipedia) Okereke denies this. I am a Republican. So a lot of Silent Alarm for me is a bit hard to swallow but luckily the few good songs on it restrain me from not breaking the cd in half due to the great MUSIC (not lyrics) within. On AWITC I feel they have laid a little off the whole \\"We're right, you're wrong!\\" Approach and have begun to search for compromise. There are things within their lyrics that I still don't personally agree with but there are many times that I do. Particularly in \\"Uniform\\" where they discuss youth's inability to get over their superficial selves. Not only is it a great song, but the lyrics work as well. For me what makes AWITC so great is the strength and talents of the musicians. Often Okereke gets all the nods but Tong is a brilliant drummer, Moakes brings the power and Lissack drives the songs with his effortless abilities. Bascially without the other three, I don't think Bloc Party could work. Every song has its own amazing epic sound and it definitely works in the band's favor because it shows off their gifts more than ever. Bloc Party have begun to finally discover that taking your time with a song is okay if you want it made right and they have widened their message a bit more to mass audiences. In so many words whether or not ALL of what Bloc Party stands for can be agreed upon is for me an impossibility. But one thing I cannot do is not give props to talented musicians and their abilities to create fantastic epic post-punk!
B000KC86F4|4.0|I had read a lot of different reviews of the Blu-ray disc, some good, some bad. After watching it myself I can say the picture can look grainy at times but it appears to be the way it was originally produced. That aside i would much rather have this movie on blu-ray than DVD. I've seen the DVD version and it is much worse. The grainy texture does not distract from the movie what so ever though.
0446528056|3.0|I would like to start by saying that I have read most of Nicholas Sparks books.  I've loved each one and awaited the arrival of the next. <br /> <br />However I am only 2/3 through Dr. John and am forcing myself to finish.  Sparks usually draws his readers into his books and you can really feel like part of the scenes.  Like a by-stander in the room.   Maybe it is that the subject matter, while real, is not something I want to read for enjoyment. <br /> <br />I'll finish the book and if my opinion changes I'll up my rating but for now, I think I'll reread \\"The Notebook\\" or \\"The Wedding\\" or something else I can really become a part of.   <br />
B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|I was going to purchase this movie on standard DVD until I bought my PS3. I've seen the movie previously on DVD but after watching it on Blu-ray I am glad I waited to purchase it. The picture quality is so much better than DVD and the sound is so clear. I have fallen in love with Blu-ray since I bought this movie and I plan to buy Blu-ray from now on.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|I was told by many of my freinds that the director's cut of this film is very dissapointing because of the change in the soundtrack. For the first 45 minutes I too was bothered by the apparent lack of musical background which provides alot of light to the film. With the sparser soundtrack the film seems more eerie, more like an art house thriller and less like a sci-fi teen drama/comedy. This really changes the nature of the movie, as does some of the added content.  <br /> <br />However, as the film progressed I felt the weight of all the eerie quiet and more drawn out scenes where starting to build alot of inertia. The details in the plot, as well as the more rich universe the director creates build on each other to make a very deep and heavy film. And of course, much more is explained than in the theatrical cut, so it is a little easier to comprehend the film even if it ends up being even more complex.  <br /> <br />Here too, the added information, especially from the Philosophy of Time Travel also change the film dramatically. What had before appeared to be a story of Donnie on a sanity challenging mission of his own actually becomes the story of the web of characters and events pushing him and leading him on his path. Things that I once took at face value as simply interesting plot twists seem to be the hand of God manipulating people's behavior to create the path for Donnie's time portal. You begin to question who the characters really are and what is the REAL purpose of their actions. I even began wondering about Gretchen and her role in the story. Before her relationship with Donnie appeared to a simple love story, but now it becomes deeper and more mystifying. <br /> <br />Also the director's cut explains Donnie's transformation from nihilism and hedonism into altruism and belief in God. This is the thread traces from Donnie's sexual digression in hypnotherapy, to the scene where Donnie and his freinds discuss the sexual habbits of smurfs and finally the classroom scene with the rabbits. Gretchen and Ms. Pommeroy's comments about the meaning of the rabbits seem to be the crucial turning point in Donnie's understanding of the nature of the events surrounding him. The scene in paricular seemed random at first, but after I returned to it became very important. <br /> <br />I was not dissapointed by this version of the film. I think the original is more entertaining and palatable, and it brings the films elements together in a much more emotional and cohesive way. This version does soften some of the overly simplistic pop elements of the original, but it loses some of the warmth. However, having seen this version the original gains alot more meaning and depth that would have been difficult to spot. The director's cut almost seems to be like supplementary viewing, or even an appendix to the original film. I enjoy both, but now that I understand the richness of the plot I would probobly rather watch the original. Despite that I think the director's cut is essential to fully appreciate this movie.
B00069YDXU|5.0|ELP, what an awesome trio,I've followed their music since 1970's and I was astonished at how well these guys can still perform. Really, it's absolutely unbelievable. When they were in their 20's they had the energy and now. I'm a pianist, love jazz, classical, hard rock, acid rock and I guarantee, there's not a group alive that can duplicate what this most talented group can do. And only a trio. Simply amazing. If you've read the complete idiot at the top of this board, I'm so, so sorry that they allowed uneducated idiots to write that crap, that idiot probably thinks that Ludwig Van Bethoven was a tiny figure in music also. ELP, where did they get their talent? I saw them live in Tucson, Az in 1975, 4th row center debuting Brain Salad Surgery and I'll still never, ever forget that show. Thank god for bringing this group together.
B000M2E2QY|4.0|Like pretty much anyone else who's heard of Mika, I first heard the criminally catchy \\"Grace Kelly\\" and was hooked. I shared it with a friend and, in under two days, he listened to it over a hundred times. Sadly, I can't say that anything else on the CD truly tops the lead single, but it's still a great album. Pure pop sugar, but completely aware of itself. As nearly any review will say, his voice will certainly draw comparisons to Jake Shears and Freddie Mercury, but honestly, a strong falsetto (probably stronger than Shears, in fact) and somewhat of a disco sensibility are pretty much the only major similarities (although \\"Stuck In The Middle\\" is pure Scissor Sisters).  <br /> <br />Highlight tracks for me were \\"Love Today\\" (currently being used in a Motorola Product Red commercial), \\"Lollipop\\" (a bouncy song that seems vaguely sexual based on the chorus, \\"Sucking too hard on your lollipop, love's gonna get you down,\\" but doesn't exactly stand up to too much scrutiny), \\"Billy Brown\\" (A Beatles-esque, thankfully non-overproduced ditty about a man who happens to fall in love with another man), and of course \\"Grace Kelly,\\" easily my favorite song of the year so far. <br /> <br />There are a few... not clunkers, but low points, notably whenever Mika seems to start taking himself seriously (aka \\"My Interpretation,\\" parts of \\"Any Other World\\"), but they pass quickly in this relative \\"lollipop\\" of an album. Sure, the lyrics are pure fluff, but they're pure fun. A definite keeper of an album. <br /> <br />A note on the price: THERE ARE TEN SONGS ON THIS 45-MINUTE ALBUM. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT PAY $3 PER SONG. I like this album very much, but I would NOT pay the listed price for it. With any luck, seeing how \\"Grace Kelly\\" hit number one in the UK based purely on digital download, and the album is #1 on amazon.co.uk, it may be released more widely in the near future so the price will be a little less completely unreasonable.
B000K7UBTI|4.0|Marvel's partnership with Lion's Gate churned out two very good Ultimate Avengers animated DVD's last year, and Iron Man is no exception.  An origin story, Invincible Iron Man finds billionaire industrialist playboy Tony Stark in over his head after restoring the buried city of an ancient Chinese kingdom.  Soon enough, Tony is critically injured, not to mention a fugitive, evil spirits are afoot, a prophecy is to be fulfilled, and the evil Mandarin is about to be resurrected.  Yeah, Iron Man is filled with the typical comic book trappings of an animated feature, but it is undoubtadly a fun ride while it lasts.  The action scenes are well done and the animation is crisp, clean, and uses the blends of 2-D and 3-D animation better than the Ultimate Avnegers DVD's did.  The voice talent is good as well, and while it may be longer than it should have been, it's still very entertaining and enjoyable.  Ignore a majority of the negative reviews here, just know that there's nothing great here, but you're guaranteed to get at least a bit of fun out of this.  The DVD features are nice too, including looks at the various Iron Man armors that Tony has worn over the years throughout the comics, and a sneak peek at the upcoming Doctor Strange DVD which looks very promising.
B000065VB0|5.0|What can I say?  Peter Gabriel once again shows his mastery of compositon and production in this third self titled album.   <br />A must have to any fan of GENESIS or PETER GABRIEL. <br />FIVE ***** STARS !!!
B000E6ESL2|4.0|This film has already been reviewed to death so I'll keep this short and sweet. 'Stay' is a mind-bending, emotional roller-coaster of a film that is similar in fashion to 'The Machinist' and 'Vanilla Sky' although not nearly as dark as the former. It is one of those pyschological films where you think you know what is going on-although it is deliberately convoluted to keep you guessing-until you get to the ending and then everything is flipped on it's head. McGregor and Gosling are both remarkable in their roles and I found myself emotionally and mentally drained at the ending. 'Stay' is definitely not mindless entertainment and while there were a few disconnects here and there, I thoroughly enjoyed this creative, emotional, and cerebral film. It had very nice visual effects also. Four stars.

1878424114|2.0|Not a bad book. An easy read to keep on the nightable. It's pleasant enough,but it is basically just homogenized eastern philosophies.Most of the contents are just nice ideas/philosophies not supported by facts. There are some good points, and there are some \\"pearls\\" of wisdom, but this book is three quarters filler. I would prefer something by the Dalai Lama or Thresholds of the Mind by Bill Harris. The former for wll thought out answers to questions, the latter for a practical program for dealing with life's stresses.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|George Harrison's demo of My Guitar Gently Weeps does showcase incredible talent.  The rest of the material sounded better as originally recorded, arranged, produced and released.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Despite what some people have said, this album is full of very original work.  No, Norah didn't completely change her sound, but she does not need to.  I feel she was creative in the music.  She did delve into a politics, but didn't do so in a preachy manner.  This album does sound darker than her other two.  Five stars because her music is a refreshing reminder of what music is all about.
B000K7VHPU|4.0|This was a rather good movie. I bought it on a whim and was happy with the purchase.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Reading some of the reviews made me kind of uneasy about pre-ordering this CD without hearing song samples from it. But it's an excellent surprise and Norah delivers once again. True this CD is more artsy with minimalistic instrumentation, but in this case less is more. After all, it's Norah's voice that's the true instrument and it shines as on her other CDs. <br />I liked her previous CD better than her first one, and this one is just as good as her second CD. On the instrumentation next to some piano we hear a lot of slide and dobro guitars with a touch of Alt-Country and even brass instruments on some titles which remind you on the soundtrack of the Godfather during the funeral service scene. There's diversity on this album and it has a slight sad undertone as some of the songs talk about 'Broken' and the Sun doesn't like you, but it becomes more positive in the end. <br />There are beautiful and haunting balads on this album like 'until the end', 'thinking about you', and a whole array of nice songs like 'wake me up' and 'little room' ... and 'rosie's lullaby' and 'not too late' conclude this CD. Again, this Norah Jones delivery is more artsy, ecclectic and not necessarily a commercial production, but instead a unique piece of art that true music lovers will enjoy a lot. The CD is not boring, although Norah's voice is soothing as usual, but I can't get enough of it - just would like to hear more. <br />
B000M06K5C|5.0|I'd heard that Bloc Party were \\"Post-Punk\\", but after listening to Silent Alarm, a great album in its own respect, you wonder why that terms got shoved around.  It was more straight-up dance rock, but it did take the idea of drums and bass driving the music from other genres. <br />   Weekend in the City however, glistens with Post-Punk stylings.  Guitar feedback abounds, and, soaring double-guitar antics smash you right in the front of the skull.  Regretfully, there are not as many protest songs on this album, but the Terrorist-Paranoia meditation of Hunting for Witches, and the racism thought-stream that is Where Is Home?, make up for that.   <br />    Lyrics are in your face and obvious, which was only jarring to me because of the relatively cryptic vocals I've been listening to recently.  They may not be the best, but they are far from being bad. Kele Okereke's voice definetly brings them home, with his incredible range and his ability to turn simple lines like \\"I would have eaten more Blackberries\\" into dramatic masterpieces. <br />     But none of this would be possible without the terrific music.  And that should be why you're buying this album.  The guitars may not be \\"technical\\" or \\"modern\\" or whatever, but they are beautiful.  It is my personal belief that, of all the things you can do with a guitar, high-note feedback is the most effective.  They soar, and plunge, and the bass and drums, in true New-Wave Post-Punk fashion, drive the songs along at a brisk pace.  The band even turns low-to-mid tempo numbers into blistering, crashing drives, then brings them down for the end, or they just explode out.  Brilliance is made of this stuff, and Bloc Party are fine sculptors. <br />   Which brings me to the band.  With two of the members born of Immigrants, or at least related to the sons and daughters of immigrants, grant lines like \\"We know we are not wanted here,\\" and \\"Our parents suffered for so long for nothing\\", and even on Hunting for Witches, because in England foreigners, particularly muslims, are feared, because of a fear of a loss of nationaly identity and more Terrorism.  Kele brings these points home, hard. <br />    Weekend is a slight concept album, with a man, begging for the ability to impress others who he hates, and seeing that he hates society, or at least what it has become, he commits suicide on the last track, after apologizing for supporting and breathing life into a culture withc he now hates.  But on tracks like Sunday he shows that, even with all the horrible things happening, there is still hope, for \\"I love you in the morning, when you're still hungover,\\" proving that, in the midst of all this societal collapse that he speaks of on all the tracks, there is still care, and love, and hope.
