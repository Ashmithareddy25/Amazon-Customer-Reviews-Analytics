0143038419|5.0|I picked this book without hearing all the hype beforehand.  Elizabeth Gilbert writes a wonderful journey of self discovery. I laughed and cried at some of the situations she found herself in.  Although many of us will never go through this journey in the manner Ms Gilbert did, it was so affirming and reassuring to read about the challenges she faced especially in the India phase. When she writes about trying to meditate and battling with thoughts and frustrations that bombard the mind, it was really something I could relate to. I have made a few attempts at meditation and to hear someone else have those same battles made me feel like it was not unusual. Thanks to Elizabeth Gilbert for sharing this very personal journey with us.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I have nothing but praise for this series, the imagery screams for a high-definition display. If you're looking for some awesome images to show off the capabilities of your new 1080p screen and player, you can't get much better than this.    Additionally, I far prefer Sir David Attenborough's original commentary on this HD-DVD release over the American female commentary which was on the version broadcast by the Discovery Channel in the US.     When I bought my first HD-DVD player, this was the first thing I ordered.

0374105235|5.0|I can't even imagine what war is like, eventhough I have read many books on the subject. But from what I've read I do know that it's a terrible experience to live, and a very hard one to survive. Those who are lucky as Ishmael to come out alive from it, really have to make an effort to leave it all behind. They end up scared in many ways, and are haunted by the horrible images they witnessed. This book is a real page turner. It's well written, and gives you a good idea of what children go through during war. I liked the way he fought his own internal war to stay sane and readapt to life. How he cared for his loved ones. And how he fought for and found a new life after all that madness. Excellent book!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Given the upcoming U.S. primaries, caucuses, and elections, it is frequently easy to think that your one voice cannot matter.  The William Wilberforce so beautifully portrayed in \\"Amazing Grace,\\" began with a commitment to moral right (yes, there is objective moral right even in this allegedly post-modern age) and stood initially alone against the shame of slavery in Great Britain until it was abolished.  One man made a difference.  Ioan Gruffudd and a superb cast present the story of a man at times uncertain of his own ability to make a difference, but never wavering in his commitment to doing what is right.  If you liked Amistad, \\"Amazing Grace\\" should become another favorite  Albert Finney's John Newton is a superb performance as the former slave trader whose conscience is tortured by the faces of each and every slave he transported and yet the author of one of the greatest hymns of Christendom
B000ICL3KG|5.0|An Inconvenient Truth is an important warning about the perils our civilization faces from global warming.  Vice President Al Gore demonstrates his keen intellect and powerful vision here, just as he has done for years with slideshows and powerpoints, to point out the danger of ignoring the signs of climate change and of taking no steps to alleviate or modify them.  The scientific material is presented cogently, so that anyone whose mind is not closed can grasp what in other hands would be dreary and technical.<br /><br />The film also fills the perceptive viewer with regret that the Supreme Court stepped into the 2000 election and denied the Presidency to this gifted, articulate man.  How differently and how much more positively the last eight years would have turned out! Sad, yes, but it should make us all the more determined never again to allow chicanery to saddle us with buffoons in high office!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is one of those products that you might be skeptical to buy, but I can tell you that it is worth it!!  I have all wood floors and the Swivel Sweeper is the handiest little product that I have ever used.  Light weight and amazingly powerful for its size.  It's not meant to be used like a vaccuum, but it picks up all those little messes that are annoying....especially in the corners of the kitchen!!  I love it!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Beatrix Potter seemed destined for a quiet, unremarkable life.  Born to a wealthy family, she remained unmarried and under the control of her redoubtable mother, with only her secret fantasy life of friendship with small animals she drew and made up stories about to amuse her.  Then, she decided to publish some of her stories, and her life changed forever.  She fell in love with her publisher, a similarly shy, withdrawn, man, and took the first steps towards independence from her mother.  The movie focusses on these important few years and skims over much of her later life, when Potter was an important force for environmentalism before the word was ever coined.  Its a beautiful experience to watch this film, filled as it is with lovely, finely drawn characters and mostly pleasant people.  Anyone who loved Peter Rabbit as a child (or still loves him) will love this film and watch it many times.
0439882826|5.0|That is the word my 5 year old grandson used when opening this book as a  Christmas present. He was right.  This is possible the best pop-up book I  have ever seen.  Amazing details. Recommend to anyone, even if not a StarWars fan.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I really liked this season.  All of the characters have really come along and the acting and storytelling has just gotten better and better.  This season of \\"secrets\\" kept me coming back for more.  My only negative with this DVD is that it doesn't include subtitles.  I don't know how to convince CBS to include subtitles on their DVDs, but it would make my viewing experience much better.
B000N3AWDE|4.0|I think it is a wonderful record. Of course, very difficult to beat \\"D'eux\\" from 1995 but still Celine sounds as fresh as ever. When she sings in her native tongue she is definitely better.
B000I0QM04|5.0|When I was about ten years old I was really into old time radio serials, and stories of high adventure. Ovalteen's Captain Midnight was one of my very early childhood heroes. I would read his adventures in old 1940s magazines and thrill to the cliffhanger radio shows that played every Saturday of my early youth. I tell you this because back in March 2004 I saw a preview for a film called \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\". I was extremely excited about this movie, as it looks to have taken its style from the 1940s adventures I knew so well. The movie was slated to come out in June. It got pushed back, and early rumors stated it was because the studio had lost faith in the movie. People were saying that it was going to bomb, better left for a home video release. Fearing another disappointment like Mars Attacks years earlier I avoided as much press and internet coverage of the film as I could; getting my only dose of the movie from the odd film trailer I got to sit through.  When I got to see it the world stopped. The movie started and there I was at age ten again. Sure the names had been changed, but all the familiar characters were there, as were all the perilous dangers. For two hours I sat open mouthed as this celluloid memory of childhood un-spooled before me. It was all there, and it was all just as I remember picturing it in my head. The daring dog fights, the ace reporter needing a scoop. Evil henchmen, strange enemy ships, the nick of time rescues, and those cliffhangers played out in a never ending array of dazzling episodes that looked as if they were taken directly off the covers of those 1940's magazines. As the film ended I could not help but feel a slight ting of sorrow, because I was 29 again. There is no episode next Saturday to start a new adventure. All I can do I go back and watch it all over again. Will I be ten again next time I see it? Probably not, but I will be remembering ten again, and looking at it with a more critical eye this next time as one does when one gets older. Will I enjoy it as much? More then I can say. This is a film that did what it set out to do and did not stray from its goal. A great escape into the past that lies just a few years into the future beyond childhood.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I heard about this series from my parent (aged around 55) and was a little skeptical - boy was I wrong to be so!  The series and the movie are fantastic, and I cannot imagine someone being sorry that they bought it.  The only downside is that the show ended so soon - but please don't let that stop you from enjoying a GREAT sci-fi series with western, humor-filled twist!
0439882826|1.0|This is the most horrible Chinese production in all Star Wars Universe. Not for children, very poor quality, bad, too thin paper, bad montage, this is definately not the prototype we could see on the Official site. Not for fans, no new material at all, no interesting facts at all, it's nothing for Star Wars fan. This 'book' is only for fanatics.

B000WQW988|5.0|This is a must have for Nirvana fans, and music fans in general. I'm glad they took their time to release this performance with all the nowadays technical standards in sound & picture quality. What amazed me the most it's the new Dolby Digital/DTS 5.1 mix by Elliot Scheiner, even the rehearsals are featured in full discrete true surround sound, you can hear clearly every single instrument coming from all different channels and of course everything is well placed. If it wasn't enough there's the 2 channel version which is far superior to the original CD.     Picture quality it's quite good for a 14 plus year old broadcast performance, seeing this concert it was hard to believe for me that unfortunately Kurt is dead and Nirvana doesn't exist anymore, specially because it feels like it was filmed yesterday, image is polished, crisp and bright as it should be. This DVD depicts one of the greatest moments in recent music history without doubt.
B000GBEWHA|3.0|While the re-mastered video gets a big thumbs up,  the audio couldn't be worse.  The ramped up sound fx are tolerable and in some cases an improvement on the original.  However, they (sound fx) are too 'in your face'.  All audio sounds very compressed.  It seems they tried too hard to make sure you noticed the changes.  The music tracks are a different monster.   They are terrible!!!  The original tracks are not simply re-mastered.  Many additional audio tracks have beeen added.  And badly I must say.  The reverb's used are stupid big and overbearing.  The many additional layers of instrument tracks tends to bury the lead vocal on some tunes!  Surround sound is stupid over-done and exaggerated.  You will need to turn up your center channel alot to clearly hear lead vocal parts or better yet, turn off your surround sound and watch in stereo.  Even in stereo, this is the worst audio re-mastering i've ever encountered.  New instrumentation sounds very generic and electronic and clearly was laid over a complete 2-track recording,  sounds a bit like karaoke instruments, not 'in the mix'  but on top of it.  Like one guy with a pc/sequencer re-did the whole soundtrack.  And some songs were changed alot,  Olivia's 'Hopelessly Devoted to you'  has drums and full instrumentation from the very beginnig,  it doesn't 'kick in' on first chorus, like the original.  They took a 1970's movie,  set place in the 50's, and now has music that sounds like 1990's bad pop.  I assume this was an attempt to sound modern.  This re-master clearly misses the mark from an audio standpoint.  The video is superb and the DVD extras are a nice addition.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|MY HUSBAND AND I REALLY ENJOYED THIS. MY 11 YEAR OLD GRANDSON IS IN TO MAGIC AND MY HUSBAND THOUGHT THIS VIDEO WOULD BE A GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFT. IT WAS. THE GRANDCHILDREN THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|The guitar and drums of this CD is captivating.  Unlike any recent music purchase, I listen to this CD literally everyday and can't seem to get enough.  I have heard other White Strips CDs before, and they are edgy and experimental. However, Elephant is by far their best (in my opinion) While the lyrics are goofy and surreal, if you like a heavy drum beat, and diverse guitar rifts - you will like \\"Elephant\\"
1580176941|5.0|What a gem of a cookie decorating book! Many books have been written on this subject; some OK and others are great---add this to the \\"great\\" list! Bakers and writers Valerie Peterson and Janice Fryer have turned out quite the encyclopedia of cookie design and here's why.....    Visually, the photography is sharp, clear, and very detailed; this is necessary in any instructional book that needs to show you how it's product is to turn out. And instead of one page and one cookie, the cookies are grouped into a category and photographed all together on that page. Each cookie stands out alone, but as a finished photo, each category of cookies is lovely.     On the opposite page of each grouping of cookies, they have made a outlined, numbered chart that describes how each cookie was decorated, step-by-step, so that you can't make a mistake. How much more could a cookie baker ask for other than having Valerie and Janice make them for you?    Peppered throughout the book are sidebars and hints on all the little things that you can do to make your cookies just that much more perfect, along with all the trials and errors they've had over their years of baking, to help you avoid the same problems.    Then, to make your cookie experience even easier, they made cookie templates that you can zerox and enlarge in order to make the shapes and designs you see in the book. This is a wonderful part of their book, but for myself, I don't have the time and patience to do that, so in addition, they have listed some sources for cookie cutters.  My personal suggestion for a great cookie cutter company would be \\"Fancy Flours\\" at \\"[...]\\". This company literally has hundreds of the most unusual and adorable cookie cutters, and they have every single one used in this book as well.     As a little sidenote, in Chapter 7, they teach you how to make cookies for construction pieces like houses, sleighs, gift boxes, etc. It is an excellent chapter and is worth the price of the book all by itself. Itdetails what type of dough to use to withstand the weight of the project, how to construct each piece, etc.     The book is sectioned as such:    CHAPTER ONE: COOKIE CRAFT INSPIRATIONS    COOKIE CRAFTS for HOLIDAYS and SEASONS  New Year's  Winter  Valentine's Day  Winter Into Spring  Easter and Spring  Mother's Day  Father's Day  Halloween  Thanksgiving and Autumn  Christmas  Hanukkah    COOKIE CRAFT for CELEBRATIONS  Showers and Weddings  Milestones  New Baby or Baby Shower  Kid's Celebration and Sports  Girlfriends  Pets    CHAPTER 2: INGREDIENTS, SUPPLIES, and EQUIPMENT  Flours, icings (thickness, thinness, etc), cookie sheets, cookie cutters, color charts, how to use your supplies    CHAPTER 3: COOKIE CRAFT PLANNING  Designing cookes (it even has a suggested sheet to use and mark your notes), color palettes, organizing your work area, cleaning up    CHAPTER 4: COOKIE RECIPES for CREATING BLANK CANVASES  Rolled Sugar Cookies  Coloring Dough  Rolled Chocolate Cookies  Rolled Nutty Cookies  Rolled Gingerbread Cookies  How to cut the dough, how to roll it out, etc    CHAPTER 5: PRE-BAKING DECORATING TECHNIQUES  Imprinting an Unbaked Cookie  Creating Windowpanes  Making Holes or Cut-Outs  Adding Dimensions to Cookies  Painting with Egg Tempera and Using Eggwash   Sugaring A Cookie or Attaching Add-Ons    CHAPTER 6: AFTER BAKING DECORATING TECHNIQUES  Royal Icing Recipes (how to's, the consistency needed, etc)  Piping and Flooding (the quintessential skill for cookie decorating)  Decorating Techniques  Using Fondant    CHAPTER 7: SIMPLE TO SHOWSTOPPING COOKIE CRAFT CONSTRUCTION  Multi-Cookie Creations  Stand-Up Cookies and Cookie Pace Cards  Cookie Messages  Party or Shower Favors, Cookie Boxes  Double-Sided Cookie Pops  Halloween Haunted House Luminaria (awesome!)  Santa's Sleigh Centerpeice  Baking Cookies for Construction     CHAPTER 8: FREEZING, STORING, WRAPPING, and SHIPPING    CHAPTER 9: COOKIE CRAFT EVENTS  Bakesales, parties, cookie swaps, etc    RESOURCESSuggested sources for cutter, baking supplies, etc    This is a very sweet book of knowledge, hard work, and creativity; you will be very happy with this as part of your baking library, thanks to Valerie and Janice!    If after this endeavor, you would like to go to the next level of cookie creations, I would highly recommend \\"Creative Cookies\\" by Toba Garrett; the dimensions of this art are boundless, and Ms. Garrett will instruct you as she is a Master Cake Designer and Sugarcraft Artist.

B000VLOKQI|3.0|I was happy to see the old clips on this dvd but was expecting more input from Roger and Pete rather than what looked like one 1 sit down interview.  Some of the guest interviewees I thought had no business being there.  Overall Id say it was satisfying yet could have been more.
0525950079|1.0|Read the first two sections then start again about page 970 and you will have enough of this book. This is no where near the quality of Pillars. What dull characters of absolute purposelessness. This is a soap opera of the middle ages at its worse. Its as if he spent the whole effort to find one horrible thing after another to happen, ad nauseum. I got tired of it two thirds the way in, gave up went to the end of the book. If anything of quality happened to anyone it happened in the last thirty pages. But to sum up everyone's life of one misfortune after another in 30 or so pages after subjecting the reader to 980 of pages nothing but the horrors they experienced was too much. I got to the point I could not care about any of the characters because they were ALL quite a stupid lot who did not seem to learn from any of their destructive behaviors or have any redeeming qualities. Even the supposed heroic characters seemed rather simple minded to me. All the characters seemed bent on self destruction and Follett explained it either through love or brutality.  Did no one have any common sense? Reading the reviews I was amazed though that anyone found the women any better than men. To me they were at least as vain and flighty as half the men. The rest of the men were just to ignorant or brutal to be believed. I wish I had now waited for the paper back edition so I would not have spent the money for the hard bound book that I could not wait to finish. I am a copious reader and rarely if ever do not finish what I start. When I do not read in detail, it really has to be bad. I read this one fast by skipping large sections because it was so repetitive of the same misery page after page. You did not have to read it closely to know that it was just going to be one misfortune after another.  Wait for the paper back if you must read it, but do not expect another Pillars from it.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|Across The Universe is the two CD soundtrack from the movie of the same name. Unfortunately, just as other reviewers noted, there is more than just one edition of this soundtrack. There's the single CD edition which I advise against because for just a couple bucks more you can buy either the 29 song version or the 31 song version on two CDs. Best Buy has the 31 song version and although the two extra tracks aren't a huge difference I personally like to get as much as I can for my money.<br /><br />The songs on this two CD set are excellent interpretations of famous numbers by The Beatles. Evan Rachel Wood, Jim Sturgess, Joe Anderson and Dana Fuchs perform most of the numbers; and there are awesome contributions by Bono (on \\"I'm The Walrus\\") and Joe Cocker (on \\"Come Together\\"). Listen also for Eddie Izzard singing \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.\\"<br /><br />The quality of the sound is quite good; and I am particularly impressed with Jim Sturgess whose voice conveys just the right amount of passion and vulnerability that can make a movie character real. I really like T.V. Carpio as she sings \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand,\\" too.<br /><br />The liner notes come in the form of a booklet with great artwork from the film, which, as of this writing, is soon to be released on DVD.<br /><br />Overall, this is excellent music throughout and the interpretations of the classic hits by The Beatles leave nothing to be desired. I highly recommend this two CD set for soundtrack aficionados and people who enjoy alternate versions of The Beatles' greatest hits.
0307387178|2.0|I have to admit to being a little confused why people are shelling out $14 for a book about a self-centered,immature kid. Nothing about him is likeable or admirable especially the way he treated people that loved him. He got what he was searching for, a suffering martyr's death. Krakauer is a good author but he definitely seems to be guilty of padding this one. Due to a lack of specific material to make a novel he continuously inserts long philosophical quotes and excerpts from his own wanderings and anyone else he can think of that had a similar journey. The world is full of people that have much more to be bitter about than this kid not to mention a world full of bums that make his adventure look like a ride in the park.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Star Trek The Original Series Season One in HD is simply AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!. I did'nt buy this off amazon it took me a long time to find it but when I did I was so happy. The audio and video is incredible and the special features are great. What you'll find in this set is all 29 Season One episodes on ten flip discs with HD on one side and SD on the other the housed in a clear plastic flip case like the original season one release the case is enclosed in a cardboard box with Mr. Spock, Captain Kirk, Dr. Mccoy, and Scotty on the left side on the front and on the right side is the U.S.S Enterprise and on the back is the Enterprise again over a planet. The box is enclosed in a sturdy plastic case with the Star Trek logo on the front and back of the case. Also in the cardboard cover is five collectible cards. On the first card on the front is Captain Kirk with a Phase Rifle from the episode \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" on the second card is Captain Kirk, Scotty, Uhura, and Dr. Mccoy on the third card is Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock with the Enterprise in the background on the fourth card is Jose Tyler and Mr. Spock from the cancelled pilot \\"The Cage\\", and finally on the fifth card is Dr. Mccoy and a shuttlecraft.

Then there is Billy Blackburn's home movies of behind the scenes footage of the show and finally there is the interactive feature which allows you to take a shuttlecraft and inspect the exterior of the Enterprise. There are also features from the original release of the firstseason. This is the best way to experience one of best shows of all time.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I'll keep it brief.<br /><br />This is the \\"it\\" you've been waiting for. Every relevant version of the film is included here. The encased version is the one I bought, but if you don't want to spend the extra, the 5 disc version is everything you need -- it's the same presentation as in this cased verions, which gives you some toys to have.<br /><br />The extras, the making of, the production stuff, is all quite interesting, if even a bit boring to some. But if you're a movie buff and like to know how stuff gets done behind the scenes, you won't be disappointed here at all.<br /><br />Short enough?
B000Y179KO|2.0|Very disappointed.  The only song worthy of their name is \\"How Long\\" and the rest is pretty awful.  There are occasional good melodies and their voices are still intact, but the lyrics .... they used to write poetry! but all these words on this album are so predictable and uninspired that they leave no room for different interpretations (remember \\"Hotel California\\" and the like? That was poetry.)   Their voices have not aged but they've lost their edge and they've become pleasant old singers of the good old days.   Too bad.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|...it's that good.<br /><br />And I wasn't disappointed. The album was actually very different than what I thought it might be. But Ms. Carlile's voice is a joy to listen to in a sea of mediocre brittneys and winsome, whiny girl singers who neither write nor play an instrument and have no idea what real artistry is all about.<br /><br />This is the second album and I'm definitely buying the first soon. T Bone Burnett produced this beautiful work of art. And if you let the disc play out, you'll hear a final song a couple minutes after the \\"last\\" cut.<br /><br />This girl is going to be around for a good long while if she doesn't get screwed up by drugs or fame.<br /><br />I'm hooked... and I'm a musician of 40 years touring and recording experience.<br /><br />Does that convince you I know what I'm talking about?
B000V1MMLI|4.0|For those who were dissatisfied with Hypnotize/Mesmerize with its cringe worthy vocals & lyrics from Daron then this is for you!<br />The missing album we all waited for after Toxicity...<br />Elect the Dead is more musical then SOAD, the hyperactive stop/start riffage is gone(except The Unthinking Majority)& replaced with more \\"Aerials\\" type vocals & layered guitars, with a nice addition of female vocals that work perfect along side Serj's, Don't stress it's still rocks! My only issue thats lacking is the Drumming John only plays on a few songs but i would have prefered the intire album.<br />Favourite Tracks:<br />\\"Empty Walls\\"<br />\\"The Unthinking Majority\\"<br />\\"Money\\"<br />\\"Feed Us\\"<br />\\"Lie Lie Lie\\"<br />\\"Beethoven's C**t\\"<br />and the build up to the chorus on Honking Antelope is worth 5 stars alone.<br />I will add the special edition packaging is worth the price, you get a bonus acoustic 4 track cd, code for a special website plus a booklet full of drawings & poetry. I also purchased this album on vinyl which is an Audiophile 180g 2 LP set, sounds better than the CD and comes with a cd version of the album tucked inside the gatefold.
076781326X|5.0|They simply do not make them like this anymore. My mother owned the soundtrack record to this movie and I remember listening to it constantly as a young child. I bought the movie for my 9-year old daughter and she loves it. The dancing, singing, and elaborate sets make it a must have if you love musicals or have children who are artistic or just love this sort of thing. Try it on a child who is currently into \\"High School Musical\\"...I bet they'll love it!
B00005JLWN|1.0|This movie fails to deliver the science and intrigue promised. What it has a lot of is guns, guns, guns and more guns.     Based on the Gun Katas; stand in the centre of a dark room and move only your arms while 12 opponents with automatic weapons try to shoot you. Result 12  dead oponents with No injury to you, the cleric  and not even a sweat!    Next,you destroy an elite police squad to save a puppy (DOG) but watch emotionless as a dozen HUMANS are lined up against a wall and slaughtered again and again and again. Conclusion: dogs are worth more than people.    You discover emotion and feelings for a woman while being videotaped in a high security prison but no one notices the display of affection and emotion in a society where emotion is outlawed.    AN elite cleric team surrounds you, the most dangerous cleric,  at arm distance with their swords sheathed, you slaughter them. Not one scratch on you.    You take out the number 2 cleric in 3 seconds and 3 moves.    All this without breaking a nail or a sweat.    This movie was a total disappointment. Utterly unbeliveable. The pace was boring at times, the \\"battles\\" pointles ( the outcome was always the same) and the end was ridiculous.    I understand that several perons were moved by the actions sequences,the style copied from a famous predecessor. Remember that you are judging THIS movie!     If you like guns, guns and more guns...then this is the movie for you. For the rest of us who want some science and reason: skip Failibrium.
B00006G8HX|5.0|I like this slightly less than Khan, but not to say I dislike the movie.  Wrath of Khan in my opinion is the best Trek movie; this is just a continuation of Khan.  It does have the semi-dubious distinction of being the only Trek movie to have me laughing out loud.  Yes, the characters and storyline are very believable, but how can you not laugh at some of the lines coming out of McCoy's mouth.  The behind the scenes footage is awesome as well.  I've always been a Trekkie, but I am just now starting my movie collection.  Thinking I'm gonna stop after the first 6 though.  I've seen the others, but they aren't as \\"Star Trek\\" as these. Maybe it's because I'm not as big a fan of Next Generation.  And I think to an extent the powers that be got a little greedy.  They figured trekkies would flock to anything saying Star Trek.  I just don't think the later movies are as well written as the earlier ones.  But that is just my humble opinion.  I know I should be sticking to the movie at hand, but you can't help but bring in the others when discussing Star Trek.<br />So, awesome movie, but slightly less awesome than Wrath of Khan.  A good movie worthy of the name \\"Star Trek\\".
1596680296|5.0|This book is easy to follow and understand.  Well illustrated with excellent photos which reinforce the written details.  The best feature of this book is that the sock patterns are listed by gauge (stitches per inch) which makes it easy to find a pattern based on your knitted swatch.  This means that you have the freedom of choosing the yarns you want to use.
B0000683DH|5.0|This is, I think, the best of the Star Trek movies made, mainly because we get to see Kirk at his best.  And I think it's one of the few times we get to see him rage on and against someone.  We see him as a more human character, trying to set a good example for this younger set of cadets coming up as well as dealing with the fact he is getting older.  We see his resentment at being no more than a desk jockey and wanting to relive his \\"glory days\\".  He becomes (again)the Kirk we always loved and maybe disliked a little because we didn't always like his methods.  And we get to see him get his heart ripped out and lose his right hand man.<br />None of the other movies capture the emotion, the frenetic pace, of the feel of the original series.  So, if you have never seen any of the movies and are a fan of the series...PICK THIS UP!!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace is the true story of William Wilberforce's struggle to legally abolish the slave trade in 19th century England.  What was accomplished in the United States through the horrors of war and the devastation of reconstruction in the South; was brought to England through the perseverance of one man of faith.
B00009TB5G|4.0|This is an excellent movie.  If you haven't watched it yet, you should be ashamed.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|This is so amazing. Features include random commentaries, a pretty nifty photogallery, among a few other little things. Honestly, my favorite thing about it is the high quality of picture, it makes it great for taking screencaps or just enjoying it in general.    A worthy DVD package if you want the first season of the best sci-fi show out there!
B000PTYP84|4.0|The extra CD comes with lots of features which is good. I was a bit disappointed with the videos that come with the mvi disc because I felt they were too short and that they jus wasn't enough. But the downloadable content makes up for this I guess. Although if you have downloaded content onto the mvi disc note that you wont be able to play them on a TV if you use the mvi disc as a DVD.     Overall a good product though.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|It is wonderful to complete our set of this series!  It is definately one of the best written TV series that ever aired.  We love having the entire series on DVD to watch whenever we want and not depend on re-runs.  Great set to complete your own collection.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|One of the best looking Blu-rays yet!  And of course Pixar makes another brilliant movie!
B000ASDFJU|5.0|When I got the gift set for Christmas this year, I was just SO excited.  I had wanted to get it long before now for myself, but just couldn't justify spending the three hundred dollars for it. So, instead, I bought each individual disc as it came out, but I wanted this set so badly.  It was a complete surprise this year!  But what's not a surprise is that this gift set is everything promised and more...<br /><br />The design and presentation of this item is just superb.  It comes in a plexiglass box that keeps all of your DVDs from each season safe.

So much fun!<br /><br />The Guest List - A look back at some of the famous faces making memorable guest appearances on the show.<br /><br />Also these are kept in a binder type book which looks gorgeous on the coffee table.  I also have \\"Kiss and Tell\\" with the pink faux alligator cover thats a perfect match to display together.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is vital video for everyone breathing today in the world.  If you breathe, you need to watch this.  It changed my life and the way I live it.  Hopefully you will buy it, watch it, learn from it.  Yea, it's that good...
B000GPIPD8|5.0|The Black Keys must have travelled in a time machine from 1969 to today, having listened to Robert Johnson and John Lee Hooker, then heard what the Rolling Stones and The Yardbirds did with it, adding some heavy drums that sound like baseball bats pounding ... I just couldn't believe my ears when I first heard this, then hearing this amazing album, one of the best discoveries I've made lately.  While I'm shocked the Keys haven't made it big (not so much considering the crap that does) I'm kinda glad, that way they won't get corrupted by stardom, like so many good ones have. My wife who doesn't like anything newer than Skynyrd was moving to it. That says it all,
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is an excellent production of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel.  The casting is spot on.  The chemistry between Ruth Wilson's Jane and Toby Stephens' Rochester really makes this miniseries believable. The choice of locations used in the filming of Jane Eyre also add so much to the story.
0440238609|1.0|I purchased this set for my cousin for Christmas.  He loves the books, but when he was about 20 pages into the first book, it skipped to page 100.  All the pages are there, but they were not in order and some of them are bound upside down.  He does love the books, but finding the pages has been somewhat challenging.
0440133688|4.0|was having a tough time dealing with stuff in Nursing school, got handed this by a friend, and it helped sort out the truly important stuff from the personality issues of those teaching!<br />very well worth the read!
B0000B1OGD|5.0|The sound and image quality of the film are excellent.  Only at a couple of points does the image have a slightly dirty or deteriorated appearance.  The light balance is excellent throughout.  The character development is nice, and at least as good as those found in the Indiana Jones movies.  The confident, strong willed woman (T.J.), the operator of a Wild West Show, works well in this movie.  My complaints are only slight.  The stop-action of the tiny horse looks a little phony.  This technique works better with imaginary creatures than with real animals.  Also, Gwangi is somewhat violet in color.  I would have preferred the more traditional dinosaur color of green or brown.  Another complaint is the sour ending.  If I had my way, I would have written a happier ending, for example, by disclosing the discovery of Gwangi's eggs with babies hatching out, where the baby dinosaurs are recruited for use in the Wild West Show.  But we are stuck with the sour ending.  If you don't want to learn the plot, you need to stop reading at this point.    The film opens with a bleak landscape resembling Death Valley.  We see eight gypsies in a valley searching for a companion.  The companion, a man with a bag, is shown stumbling down a gulch.  He clutches a bag.  Something alive is inside, something making neighing sounds.  But an old blind woman (a witch), one of the gypsies, issues a warning, \\"No, no.  Leave it I tell you.  If he does not go back to the Forbidden Valley, we will all suffer a terrible fate.  Fool!  Ah.  One day he will learn to obey the Law of the Gwangi.\\"    A few minutes of credits are then shown.    The story begins with a Wild West Show marching into a Mexican town.  A cowboy atop a moving stagecoach twirls a lasso, followed by a cluster of running Mexican boys.  Then, a cute Mexican boy (Lope) materializes and offers to do odd jobs for Tuck Kirby, a former associate of the Wild West Show.  We see the actual Wild West Show.  Indians chase a stagecoach aroundand around the arena.  The stagecoach is set afire, and it leaves by way of a gate.  There are faux gun fights and faux fist fights.  The stunts are excellent.      The next act introduces us to Miss T.J. Breckenridge (\\"T.J.\\"), a beautiful woman, who does tricks on a horse.  We see her atop a horse, about to dive off a platform into a pool of water, where the rim of the pool is ringed with flames.  The horse dives from the platform--a trick identical to that performed, at one time, at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  But the crowd in the arena is sparse.      Tuck Kirby makes another appearance.  T.J. does not welcome him at first.  T.J. throws him out saying, \\"You stick to your con tricks and I'll stick to my horse tricks.\\"  Lope is friends with a professor, an American paleontologist.  The old professor adds science to this science fiction film.  At turning point then occurs.  We see the arena being used for rehearsing a bull fight.  A matadore practices in the ring, but Lope fools around in the ring with a blanket.  A bull begins to attack.  Tuck Kirby dashes into the ring and saves the boy.  Then T.J. falls back in love with Tuck.  Another man (Carlos) saves Tuck from the bull.    In the next scene, we finally see the tiny horse, the one contained in the cloth sack at the start of the movie.  This occurs 25 minutes into the movie.  \\"What are you doing here, over 50 million years after you should have been extinct,\\" exclaims the professor.  T.J.'s goal is to use the tiny horse as an act in the Wild West Show, to bring in more customers.      But at night, the dwarf, the blind witch, and their gypsy friends, steal the tiny horse, and deliver it back to the Forbidden Valley and set it free.  While stealing the tiny horse, the dwarf conks Carlos on the head.  But Lupe with the professor, and separately Tuck Kirby, follow the gypsies to the Forbidden Valley.  Finally, 40 minutes into the film, the gypsies let the tiny horse free, saying, \\"Fly little one.\\"    Within a few minutes, T.J., Tuck, Lope, and the professor have re-captured the tiny horse, but it escapes and leads them through a tunnel to a second valley.  The second valley resembles Elephant Hill, a part of Canyonlands National Park.  Now, fortyfive minutes into the film, there is a scene with a pterodactyl.  The bird carries Lupe off, but he is saved a few minutes later.  Then, a tiny dinosaur appears, and shortly thereafter, Gwangi materializes and eats the tiny dinosaur.  Then, 50 minutes into the film, a triceratops appears.      Comedy makes its appearance.  One of the group observes that the bullets that they had been shooting at the dinosaurs were only blanks, used in the Wild West Show.  The men dig a deep hole and cover it with pine branches.  Something gets caught in the trap, but it is only the professor.      From the 60 minute to 75 minute time point (15 min altogether), there is a generous lassoing scene.  At one point, three cowboys on three horses have simultaneously thrown three lassos around Gwangi's neck.  After this scene, Gwangi is wheeled into town on a large cart.  But in lumbering along a desert road, they encounter the witch and the dwarf.  The witch warns them, \\"Soon you will be doomed, all of you, unless the evil one is set free.\\"       Within a few minutes, we are back at the arena.  This time the arena is packed with thousands of Mexicans, many with sombreros.  But we see the witch instructing the dwarf to set Gwangi free.  The dwarf sneaks under Gwangi's red tent and unlocks the gate to the cage.  At this point, an elephant act draws to a conclusion.  Then Gwangi escapes, with the Mexican dwarf in his mouth.  Gwangi fights the elephant, and in the mean time, there is a massive mob scene, as thousands of Mexicans dash from the arena, upsetting fruit carts.  The scene is reminiscent of the theater mob scene from THE BLOB with Steve McQueen.  Part of the mob runs into a cathedral.  At one point, an escaping person falls and rollsdown the cathedral steps.  But at 90 minutes, Gwangi enters the cathedral.  A torch is overturned, and the entire cathedral, along with Gwangi, goes up in flames.  The film ends at 95 minutes.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|Except for tracks 2 & 3, which I found a bit too formula based, Continuum was a great surprise for someone who had grown up on the guitar sounds of the early 60s to early 70s. Originally inspired to purchase the CD based on seeing John Mayer perform on the Eric Clapton's DVD 'Crossroads', I was somewhat disappointed that the tune 'Gravity' wasn't the longer version, full of great guitar riffs.
0143038419|5.0|First off, I loved this book.  It has been a long time since I have savored each page of a book; awaiting with anticipation the few moments when I can quietly let the pages unfold.  This was such a book.  Ms. Gilbert is the ultimate travel companion for a journey around the world and into the human heart.    Frankly, I am shocked at the harsh judgments of some of the reviewers.  If you didn't enjoy the book, that's fine.  I just find it disheartening the way people have attacked Ms. Gilbert for her personal life, her choices and her insights.  My goodness- she's a human being just like everyone else.  She is fallible and the first to admit it.  If you've got your life so worked out that you can't gain something from this book, then congratulations.  But perhaps this is what separates those who love the book from those who are irritated by it.  You either relate to Ms. Gilbert or you don't.   I know that I, and many other women, have resonated with Ms. Gilbert's story.  I am married with a small child and seemingly have \\"everything.\\"  And yet, I have crushing moments of despair over the emotional distance between my husband & I, and have a deep longing for something more.  I have questioned my marriage and cried on my knees at the thought of divorce.  I have made monumental mistakes in my marriage and am still learning to love.   I still question my place in the world, and how I can best contribute to the world.  I am still walking a winding spiritual path that has lead me in many directions.  I love traveling and have often dreamed of a journey such as Ms. Gilbert's.  Does that make me an immoral, lost , even crazy (as some reviewers label Ms. Gilbert) person?  I think not.  I think that makes me real.  And that is what makes Elizabeth Gilbert real.      I am a seeker.  Ms. Gilbert is a seeker.  If you are, too -- then I highly recommend this book to you.
0679721037|5.0|I saw this on a shelf and figured \\"why not?\\"<br /><br />It's an interesting read about 6 survivors of the bomb and what they went through.<br /><br />Overall, it's interesting to see what the \\"enemy\\" went through during this time especially when it involves the Atomic bomb.  Dealing with the destruction and the unknown aspects of radiation poisoning.  The subsequent exclusion from society as labeled the hibakusha and eventual inclusion as a political gains for the government of later times.<br /><br />What I found interesting was the fact people would ask for help in polite terms.  The fact they noticed people with Grey hair tended to not loose it with radiation sickness and the fallout seemed to boost plant growth.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent book and should be read by those that study the Pacific war.
B000000OF6|5.0|This is the ultimate CD for anyone who loves Queen. Two CD's for all their greatest hits. I'm really enjoying this one.
B000QGDIKM|5.0|I will keep it brief.  As good as Gish, Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie?  No.  As good as Adore?  Probably yes.  Better than Machina?  Probably yes.  Good album?  YES.  Should you own it?  YES.  Is this special edition version worth the extra?  No, not really.  Stick with the regular CD.<br /><br />Note:  I have 4 copies of Zeitgeist, because I bought every special version I could get my hands on :)
B000H1RFKA|5.0|Kiss Kiss Bang Bang ended up being much more than I originally expected.  An incredible movie to say the least.  Humor, suspense, and a little action for taste.  The movie has all star performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer.<br /><br />The movie starts off rathe innocently in Indiana as innocence seems all the part.  You may start wondering if you are watching the right movie.  Quickly come in to narrate and essentially telling the story is Robert Downey Jr.  The story tells a rather good tale about three characters.  Downey plays a character named Harry who seems to be trying to find himself as a small time crook nobody.  Kilmer plays a guy who goes by the name of Gay Perry and yes he is gay.  Lastly the rather unknown Michelle Monaghan plays the attractive Harmony who is trying to make it as an actress.<br /><br />This is about as far as the story gets from where it goes.  The mystery begins quickly and never gets too dark.  What makes the story so good is the great chemistry between these three actors and the comedy that ensues.  Shane Black knows how to make a great mystery with comedy since his name is best known for Lethal Weapon.  There are times where I couldn't stop laughing even during the darkest scenes.  Don't let the fact that there is a lot of humor since the story still is great.<br /><br />Watching the Blu-ray version was well worth it.  The picture was vibrant and filled with life.  Bringing out most of the scenes the way they were intended to be seen.  The sound was great on my speakers.  An excellent movie for a great price.  Despite the extras lacking.  If you are looking for a wonderful movie that will keep you laughing with a great story then Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a must have to any collection.  This is now one of my favorite movies.

B000UJ48WC|5.0|This classic remains a sensational, psychological thriller over 25 years later.  The story remains the same but now it comes in fantastic high definition.  Stanley Kubrick's vision was different from how Stephen King originally wrote it.  Although it's Kubricks vision that makes this movie so enjoyable.<br /><br />Set in beautiful Colorado the story is dark in a bright environment.  Jack Nicholson plays an average father named Jack.  Jack has been unemployed for a few months and is trying to be a writer.  To further his writing he takes the opportunity to move his family to a desolate resort in the Rockies.  The resort closes during the Winter and hires Jack to be a caretaker during that period.<br /><br />Jack's son Danny has begun to exhibit abnormal behavior by making an imaginary friend out of his finger.  This friend tells Danny things that seem to exhibit a special ability.  Jack's wife Wendy just seems to want everything to go right in their lives.  Unfortunately the move to the resort is the worst thing that can happen.<br /><br />Most of the acting is excellent in this movie and the scenes are still scary at times.  Even though movies have become more action packed and fast paced The Shining still shines.  That is why movies like this get even better with time.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version is okay.  The remaster is not the best I have seen for an older movie.  The picture is more defined but still not what I would like to see.  I am not going to mark down the score since this movie is too good for that.  The picture is better and the price is right.  For people who want to add a wonderful classic to their Blu-ray collection, The Shining is quite the movie to have.  For the price it can't be beat.
B000ROALCG|5.0|If you love salsa music, this is a great CD. Marc Anthony sings great renditions of original Hector Lavoe music, BRAVO!!!
B00005JLZN|5.0|I recently saw this movie, The Life of David Gale, on TV, having never heard of it before.  The critics slammed it, and I guess it was buried. I'm just a movie watcher, so what would I know compared to a \\"critic.\\"  I thought it was great!  Kevin Spacey, Kate Winslet, and Laura Linney were terrific.  I'm going to buy this just to watch it again for all those little clues that are missed the first time around
0807126063|5.0|This is simply one of the greatest books ever written by anybody. You should own two copies. One for your continuous thumb-stains, and a fresh one for your friend.
B000P0I4O4|3.0|This is a movie that I liked alot, but it suffers from a lack of good action directing and the beginning could have been a little tighter.  Overall an enjoyable slow paced action thiller.
1582701709|5.0|This book really puts things into perspective and changes the way you think. I know many people that this book has helped.
0783240287|5.0|I love this version of Joseph.  The Narrator is one of the most talented people performing today and Donnie turns in a performance that makes me remember why I used to look forward to the D & M show every week when I was (much) younger.  Excellent job Maria :)    Scott
B000RZIGZ4|4.0|Possibly one of the best action movies of all time, you really can't go wrong with it, but that's true of the movie in any format. As for the HD-DVD format, this is a bare-bones DVD, but in my view that's fine. I want to watch the movie, I don't want to see all the behind the scenes stuff, hear what the director was thinking and look at still pictures from the set, but if  that's what you're looking for, then you won't find it here.     The remaster to HD seems to have been quite good, but remember, this was filmed in the 80s, so don't expect to see the same level of clarity you'll get from something filmed on an HD pro camera today. Still, definately a cut above the non-HD format and well worth the purchase.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Live Free or Die Hard a.k.a. Die Hard 4 brings to the screen another John McClane adventure.  This time terrorists have hacked into everything that is \\"hackable\\" and threaten to bring the United States to its knees.   Bruce Willis, Justin Long, Maggie Q (!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.  Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.    The only major setback (as in the case of Next, The Legend of Zorro and other movies) is in relation to those \\"geniuses\\" that came up with the French-speaking Europeans as villains and with no explanation whatsoever as to their motive!  It's not as if there aren't enough prospective terrorists out there, they're lining up for crying out loud, so why go with some of the most unlikely candidates?    What European would even bother???      Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the special effects are all very good.  In conclusion, Die Hard 4 is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection, especially if you are a Bruce Willis fan.
158270208X|4.0|This is basically just a journal book .. but it is very nice and has gotten me motivated to start writing my gratitude items.
B000OYC7A8|4.0|David comes home.    David has finally come home and even invited us in to take tea in a sense. For arguably the first time in his solo career it feels to me as if I can connect with a complete artist, free of the baggage of that history we all know about. Minus a few issues the critical side of me can't totally block out, there are moments here where DG breaks through the veneer like never before. Neither he nor Roger has ever reached the heights separately that they did together, something no Floyd fan would argue. But here David isn't shooting for that and because of that actually succeeds beautifully with this show. While there are the obligatory PF songs to placate the many there to see them, this DVD is not a \\"must for every Floyd fan\\" that many proclaim, it is a must for every DG fan and for any fan of progressive rock traditional. Some of the finest moments here do not occur on the most predictable classics, but in the less obvious spaces that David is working hardest to sell. What comes through are moments of incredible poignancy and passion, of sides of DG and even Wright that have long been either hidden or simply not pronounced. Moments where everything is shed and Cambridge shines through, boyhood is felt, confusion is revealed but so is relief and wisdom. Grief for a recently lost friend is shared. Emotions that may once have been kept hidden are let go. Glances of every color of his art seem to be touched on, and the fact that he stands there so emotionally open and so able to (finally) connect with many of us who have in the past questioned his post-Waters work (sometimes with good reason) is not just impressive but is really heartwarming to witness. That is what really makes this release so impressive to me. There is a moment in \\"A Pocketful of Stones\\" where David is delivering the most amazing vocal with his head way back and only Wright's keys behind him; the level of intimacy and effectiveness in that moment is right up there with something fromJoni Mitchell's finest hour. I've never quite felt such a moment from solo Gilmour and on this emotional level you realize that this is really \\"progressive\\" for them. They are showing a side beyond past regurgitations of their glory days (as fun as they may be) that are spectacular and that more than legitimize this release as something beyond \\"another quasi-Floyd concert.\\" I think he has taken serious care to make each song nearly the definitive version of his life, only he could say that, but it sure seemed that way to me.    The presentation could not be more perfect. The atmosphere was draped in a darkness which I really like, but with clean, sharp lights alternately breaking through sharply or bathing the band and audience is cloudy dreaminess; in both cases perfectly attuned to the music. And the colors and clarity of the lights are the best I've ever witnessed: rather than the sometimes cheesy flashing lights you might find at the corner strip club, these lights have the most amazing colors I can only describe with words like calming and pure. Everything looks great, and the editing is slow but crisp, assuring you never miss anything but not flashing all over like a movie car chase. Everything is captured in the best sound and visual imaginable. The near nuclear level lighting explosions during the climax of Echoes were really just unbelievable; I can't imagine the assault to the senses from the main floor.    Just a few minor criticisms I'll offer. The initial Dark Side material came off as clearly the low point to me. I think that the choice to perform this material was wrong and that given the direction of the show there could have been much more effective openers, something more obscure, less obvious, less safe. And performing a piecemeal, lower profile DSoTM is pointless after doing it correctly on Pulse. And while the valiant attempt to pull off Arnold Layne was certainly daring, I relish the thought that even the most professional musicians with all oftheir expensive equipment will never capture the pure essence of a young man named Syd, will never capture the wonder of that moment in time.    But set aside my criticisms and those of others and try this DVD. Dave's playing is jubilant; the leads on the majority of tracks are absolutely breathtaking. His voice has held up remarkably well over these years, something many of his contemporaries (not just Waters) sadly cannot say. Beyond just hitting notes his voice has that velvety, comforting warmth it had in his youth, just seasoned a bit more with time. The band's performance was very professional though clearly acting as backdrop for the Big Dog. Crosby and Nash offered some decent harmonies and Robert Wyatt's heartfelt solo was a very touching moment. As I mentioned, the material from his new album, performed in full, is quite strong. I haven't heard the studio version but here it was mostly very pleasing, emotionally engaging, and delivered with passion from everyone on the stage. And while delivering the concert-ending finale of his screaming Comfortably Numb guitar solo at a deafening roar, he allows a bit of humor to come through by showing something funny in the audience....I won't give it away but it was a message perhaps that he doesn't take himself too seriously!    This review is entirely a flash impression without many facts about the specifics of the songs or the boatload of extras on disc 2. Others will cover those in greater detail. Mainly I wanted to let other DG skeptics/cynics (like myself) that this is one you shouldn't skip, this is....different...in a good way. While I will always harbor some ill-will towards artistic decisions DG has made regarding the Floyd I have to acknowledge his resilience and the success of this fine moment. I can understand why some have given it 5 stars, though I will need repeated viewings over a few years to decide if I could proclaim it that. But it is not another piece of unnecessary middle-aged affluent-rock product that we should ignore. While it may be too mellow and long-winded in places for those seeking a real rock-show kick in the pants or cutting-edge wild prog, that's not what this one is intended for-let's face it, he's well into his 60s now. While we may never get to experience the excitement of the true PF together again you'll realize watching this that we don't need to. This was likely as good as it gets for the David fan, so hopefully we won't have to watch the Floyd legacy degraded by a half-hearted catty reunion and the hype it would bring. With this show Gilmour has left history a fine document to his past, which I appreciate. And hopefully David and Roger will sign off on the DVD release of a classic Floyd concert from the WYWH, Animals, or Wall tours. There must be a high quality video recording somewhere. I wish the two of them could finally get it to the fans who have waited long enough.    ....oh yeah, one more thing. Shine On. Watching David deliver this vocal about his old friend Roger Barrett, I thought of what he said in an interview after Syd passed: \\"I now have this lasting regret that I was so obedient to the family's wishes not to disturb his peace. A few years ago my wife Polly said to me `how would you feel if he dies?' I said, Regretful, probably. And I am. I should have gone down there, knocked on his door and said, Hey, let's go for a pint. Because we were friends. I can't see that seeing an old friend would have done any damage.\\" Wow. All of us probably have someone we could say that about-under different circumstances of course. Perhaps that's what makes the sentiments of the song so powerful to the listener.    Nice to meet you David.
0399230033|5.0|A friend had this book and I just loved it, so I ordered it for my 2 year old.  There are few words, but the pictures tell a great story of zoo animals being freed and then following the zookeeper home.  Cute illustrations with hidden pictures, will grow with the child from looking at the colorful pictures to learning the animals to counting the colored keys as the gorilla frees each animal.  Very sweet!
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I agree with the main statement of 'if you're able to get over your initial gag reflexes of rats cooking then this is the movie for you.'  I think I was doing good until climax of the film and there is literally hundreds or thousands of rats cooking and what not.  At that point, I couldn't stop shaking my head.  But as far as Remy and his non-cooking companion, I found the duo charming.  Pixar is the king of what they do and for that I will always be a returning viewer.
B000K15VSA|4.0|My rating is based on the overall product and not just the film.  I have received the actual product and it is not the brushed metal finish as has been widely marketed.  It is unfortunate because the flat plastic gray of the actual product looks cheap considering the production of this set.  Ultimately it does not matter at this time since the only way to obtain the 5-disc set is in this form.  Perhaps in the future the 5-disc set will be offered separately.  The price of the set reflects the overall quality.  You get alot of stuff, but it feels cheap.  For Blade Runner fans who are starving for collectibles, this is a great set.  If this set is the only way to get the 5 discs then I wouldn't mind paying more and getting higher quality collectibles.  For example, the unicorn model included could have been sculpted to look more like the one pictured in the film and the spinner has a cheap feel, though it looks pretty much like the one featured in the film.  I enjoyed the lenticular animated scene and the production sketches, but I would have much rather had a photo collection consisting of those from Leon's drawer, of Rachael and her mother, maybe some from Deckard's piano, and especially the Polaroid-like print-out of Zhora.  The photos were, to me, the main ephemeral icons of the movie.<br /><br />Overall it is a fun set to have, but i would have paid a little more for a \\"Collector's Edition\\" with higher quality extras(aside from the dvd content).
1594489505|5.0|I have now read both the Kite Runner and a Thousand Splendid Suns and am convinced that Hosseini is truly the best author for gaining an understanding of how life in the war ravaged areas affects people.  Thousand Splendid Suns truly moved me to tears as you witness good, strong lives totally wasted by dominating males.  Hosseini is so very effective at establishing characters that your feel their passions for their homes and homeland.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is by far one of the best shows ever made, and watching without commercials and straight through the 7 seasons makes it even better.    I've also learned a lot about the US government, and it has prompted me to go looking for more information. I was very pleasantly surprised to note how well researched the show is. I think anyone interested in US politics but thinks it might be a boring task should start here.    Great for an election year gift!
B000QXDED6|3.0|I didn't set out to like this movie, figuring it was going to be the cinematic equivalent of a laddie magazine. But I did like it! It's very simple, really.    1. Historically accurate? No.  2. Good acting? Not.  3. Plot? Huh?    BUT...  1. Lots of hot, in-shape men! Do guys know that in the real world, YEARS can pass between times we gals see guys who are in shape--not musclebound, tendon-tied freaks, just in good shape? Well, every guy in this movie has a bod. Nothing to dislike about that!  2. Women who look like real women, not bolt-on boob, snap-on hair, press-on nail porn star wannabes. The queen has a realistic bosom and even a few faint lines on her face! Bravo to casting! It's nice to be able to see ourselves--our real selves--in a major role.  3. Interesting CGI, giving the movie a deep, dark, from-the-mists-of-time atmosphere. There is lots to enjoy in the cinematography.    My only \\"complaint\\" is Gerard Butler's accent. I had so much trouble understanding him, I actually turned to my best friend and asked her if he had a speech impediment. She said she thought he was trying to hide his Scottish accent. I don't see why he was worried about it, because the other actors have an assortment of different accents. But since I was more interesting in looking than listening, it wasn't a really big hindrance.    Ladies, don't be put off by the fact it's derived from a comic strip--oops, I mean \\"graphic novel\\"--there's plenty in here for us, too!
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Paramore is the next generation No Doubt. From Hayley's passionate vocals to the band's rockin' capabilities, this is the next hot group in rock. Each song on this CD is worth listening to, I don't skip any. My fave tracks are Misery Business and Crushcrushcrush. This CD is worth the money if you're debating this over anything else!

I have already purchased 4+ copies for families and friends. This is a great way to start doing what you should be doing at work and avoiding the things that you shouldn't be doing. It is the beginning step to enjoying work. Imagine that!
B000OVLBF8|3.0|Not really a 'good' movie... this will never win an Academy Award for anything, but it's a FUN movie, especially for fans of the superhero genre.
B00005JPAO|4.0|Good movies, like good books and music, should be viewed and heard many times, especially when the performance of one or more characters is remarkable.  I saw \\"The Queen\\" several times when it was released, and now I own the DVD, which I have also watched on many occasions.  What invariably happens is that we see a scene in a different light, we discern something that previously eluded us, or we radically change our perception of a character.  This suggests that the way we perceive all media is in constant flux, and that sometimes we are never quite certain about our judgments.<br /><br />For me, the more that I have seen \\"The Queen,\\" the less I am troubled by her (and her mother's and husband's) obliviousness and apparently stubborn and anachronistic behavior.  In the first viewings, I remember agreeing with Michael Sheen (who plays Blair superbly):  \\"Will someone please save these people from themselves?!.\\"<br /><br />But after more viewings, I began to feel sorry for Elizabeth and viewed her as a victim of tradition, duty and the cloistered, myopic surroundings she lived in that seemed to cut her off from common sense and the changing, \\"modern\\" world (the word \\"modern\\" is a key concept in the film).  I began to feel compassion for her and felt that she was simply overwhelmed by events that she could not (rather than would not) comprehend.  (I think the movie attempts to engage our compassion, but in one instance it does so with an astonishingly inept and heavy-handed metaphor of Elizabeth compared to a noble stag at Balmoral that is relentlessly stalked and eventually killed.)  So, again, I agreed with Sheen:  \\"That woman has given her whole life in service to her people.  Fifty years doing a job that she never wanted.  A job she watched kill her father.  She's executed it with honor, dignity, and as far as I can tell, without a single blemish, and now we're all baying for her blood.  All because she's struggling to lead the world in mourning for someone who threw everything she offered back in her face.  And who for the last few years, seemed committed 24/7 to destroying everything she holds most dear!\\"<br /><br />Recently, I happened to see on YouTube Elizabeth's actual 1997 speech on television from Buckingham Palace and compared it with Helen Mirren's same speech in the movie.  And then I started to question my judgment about my compassion for Elizabeth.<br /><br />That, I think, is the conflicting nature of this movie, and the remarkably layered performance that Mirren gives.  We may never discover what transpired during that historically important week, and moreover, which Elizabeth actually participated in those events.he offered back in her face.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Lucky Dexter--found by a compassionate policeman at a grisly crime scene and taken home as his own adopted son. Unlucky Dexter--survivor of an unspeakable crime scene, bearing a memory failure of said scene. How interesting that such a program filled with blood aftermath of abhorrently violent murder scenes should also promote social awareness of the horrors of  victims of childhood abuse.<br /><br />What is the age of the child at the time the abuse ends? Within memory? Beyond memory? Or within a paralyzed memory? What is the condition of the affected child as he grows into maturity? All these questions are answered during the first season of this spectacular television series.<br /><br />I came to the series by way of DVD and did not endure the torture of waiting week after week for the next installment. How did people do it? I saw the series almost as a movie and thus almost as a whole. The unfolding was more vivid and focused as I watched Dexter's story come to life. As in any good novel, the story was laid out, a layer at a time, revealing a little more, a little more, until the season finale. What a zinger that was!<br /><br />Dexter revealed himself as a void, an empty shell, but as the season moved on, what he revealed was a Dexter filling the void unbeknownst to himself. He was not acting out, he was living out, creating new memories with a girlfriend, with his sister, and his co-workers. Revealing anything more would be tantamount to treason for those who love their stories unspoiled.<br /><br />That his policeman dad taught him to kill ethically--to kill only those who deserved killing, that is serial killers--lay the foundation for all his murders to follow. Working within the framework of a blood splatter<br />analyst allowed him to control his urgent need to kill, a need originating at the unspeakable childhood crime scene where he was found. His father discovered Dexter's need and worked with him within this desperate need, advising how to live a human existence. This nurture is again part of the socializing of an abused child (abuse comes in many forms as revealed in this series).<br /><br />Dexter is a many-layered character, perfectly played by Michael C. Hall. The series \\"Dexter\\" is a multi-layered story, filled with so many stories of human misery, longings, fantasies, and even an occasion bout of happiness. The serial killer story is merely a  framework for the real stories that play out every week.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|I grew up with The Beatles and consider them the greatest pop/rock band.  I also consider Lennon and McCartney the greatest composers of the 20th century, who were also blessed with fine voices and perfect harmony. So, when my daughter saw this movie and strongly recommended the soundtrack, I was very skeptical.  I thought to myself:  \\"Why is there yet another attempt to cover The Beatles' songs; with few exceptions, the results are abysmal.\\"<br /><br />But when I listened to these songs, reinterpreted by these talented singers, I was really impressed.  Especially noteworthy are Jim Sturgess and Martin Luther McCoy; they are gifted performers.  What struck me the most, however, was that all of these singers took on our generation's sacred songs (our zeitgeist) and succeeded in giving these songs vibrancy and new meaning.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />\\"Girl\\"--Beautifully sung, but I wish he was allowed to finish the song.<br /><br />\\"All My Loving\\"-- Again, Sturgess gets it right with all the youthful exuberance this song requires.<br /><br />\\"Let It Be\\"--Fantastic!  McCartney always intended this to by a church hymn, and I have heard gospel renditions by Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles, but the choir here is superb and makes this my favorite version of the song to date.<br /><br />\\"Come Together\\"--I forget who told Joe Cocker that he was the only white man with soul, but this song showcases his talents.  He brings a soulful, bluesy feeling to this song.<br /><br />\\"I Am The Walrus\\"--While I still prefer Lennon's psychedelic, stream of consciousness in your face version, taking aim at his overzealous song critics, Bono is able to convey this anger with great success.  Bono is wonderfully manic.<br /><br />\\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\"--I never thought that I would hear a better version of Lennon's defining moment of introspection and self-doubt, but Sturgess captures this mood effectively, in a haunting and mesmerizing way.<br /><br />\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\"--This is worth the price of admission alone.  McCoy even betters George Harrison (in \\"The \\"White Album\\" version with the hard-rocking Clapton backing and in \\"The Anthology\\" version with Harrison alone with his acoustic guitar.)  McCoy starts out quiet and breathless and by the end wrings every emotion out of this song.  His range and voice remind me of Seal's.  This is my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Across The Universe\\"--Sturgess takes a wordy, but extremely poetic Lennon song and does not stumble over the words, which is so easy to do.  He is able to get at the core of the song and discover its purity.  However, unlike Lennon, Sturgess sings defiantly and transforms the song into an anthem.<br /><br />Shortcomings:<br /><br />\\"Hold Me Tight\\"--This is the fault of the director and producer and not the performer.  Lennon has admitted that this song was \\"filler\\" and far from his best.  In this album, it is forgettable.<br /><br />\\"Blue Jay Way\\"--Again, poor song choice.  This is one of the worst songs by Harrison and on the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" album.  It has no purpose other than droning on and on; it is no better on this album.<br /><br />\\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite\\"--I prefer the original.  Lennon is so much better than Izzard.<br /><br />\\"Because\\"--This rendition is not bad; it's just not close to the original.  The Beatles knew that they were breaking up on \\"Abbey Road,\\" and they gave the performance of a lifetime on the album.  It is reported that they painstakingly recorded many takes of this song to get the phrasing, harmony and pitch perfect.  Listen to the version on \\"The Anthology\\" or \\"Love,\\" since it is a cappella.  It features McCartney taking the high part, Harrison the middle, and Lennon taking the bottom.  Their lush three-part harmony is so tight and perfect, that it is difficult to tell who is singing what part.  Their version has never been equalled.<br /><br />\\"Revolution\\"--This is the only song sung by Sturgess that doesn't work for me.  The original song is angry Lennon at his best, with distorted guitars augmenting his strident singing.  Sturgess' version is too light and benign and seems misplaced.<br /><br />\\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\"--In this song, Bono is banal.  It's an average performance of a great song.<br /><br />In sum, this is a wonderful album.  The singers deserve credit for taking on the daunting task of The Beatles' canon and making it work, and more importantly, reinterpreting it so that it succeeds on its own merit.  The fact that my daughter, who considers The Beatles \\"so last century,\\" loves this album, and the fact that her die-hard Beatles' fan father loves it too, should speak volumes.ing.

B000TLMWMY|5.0|We have thoroughly enjoyed these CD's.  Having been to the old Ryman Auditorium to enjoy the Grand Ole Opry in person, brought back many happy memories.  These CD's were so entertaining that after each song, regardless of the artist, we almost found ourselves applauding, just as if we were there in person.  It would be fantastic if more of the old tv shows were made available and let us go back to the times of watching tv being a family type of entertainment and a pleasure.  Thanks for the memories!
B000WZAE1I|1.0|STARDUST is one of my favorite films of 2007.  I give it five stars and hope Michelle Pfeiffer finally garners an Oscar off of it.  This DVD, however, is a whole 'nother story.  The print of the film here has inexplicably been edited down from the movie I saw in the theater in August.  There are seconds missing here and there that constitute some of the funniest (and naughtiest) bits in the project.  Where is the graphic transformation of Michelle Pfeiffer's body from old witch to young babe as she consumes the last of the old fallen star?  What happened to Jake Curran's full reaction upon discovering he's been magically changed from a goatherd to a buxom young serving wench?  And where is the rest of Mark \\"Arthur Weasley\\" Williams' brilliant turn as a goat turned into an innkeeper?  A snip of it shows up in the Deleted Scenes, a snip that was not deleted from the theatrical print I saw.  I believe there was more.  There's no indication on the package that this DVD is different from the cut shown in theaters, but it definitely is.  Apparently some self-appointed censor at Paramount thought the original STARDUST might be a bit too raunchy (even at PG-13) for the kiddies who were certain to be viewing it over the holiday season.  They left all the violence in, of course.  They always do.  How about making this right, Paramount?  AND NOW THE BLU-RAY:  This is the same censored print they used for the DVD, and worse, the picture quality is no better than the DVD.  Further, the supplementary materials that were on the DVD have with one exception been deleted.  I'm glad I didn't pay much for this disc.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This five disc version is a nearly exhaustive treatment of this seminal work in movie history, one of my favorite movies, and one of those great movies that forever remind of the time that I first saw it.<br /><br />Roy Batty was my favorite character in this movie.  Harrison Ford and Sean Young really did not have much chemistry in this movie, and Daryl Hannah was completely uglified by her fright wig and makeup.  Rutger Hauer, IMHO, carried this movie, and I have yet to see either Hauer or any other character or actor display in any other movie such a wide and complex array of charm, love, anger, malice, menace, machismo, sadness, sensitivity, and poetry as Roy Batty.  The various featurettes and commentaries make clear just how much Rutger Hauer's ideas contributed to the creation of this character.<br /><br />I got this five disc version mainly to get the work print, which is the only thing different, DVD-wise, from the four disc version.  Oh, and you get the serially numbered \\"Collector's Edition\\" plastic briefcase, some prints of conceptual art for the film, a clear plastic display with four pseudo holographic photos of Decker - stuck together with magnets, a plastic unicorn, and a plastic model of a spinner car.<br /><br />The best part of the work print DVD is the featurette about the restoration team that put together the Final Cut version, and their description of the various digital changes in the Final Cut.  There is also a richly detailed commentary track by author Paul Sammon explaining all the differences between the work print version and the other versions.<br /><br />The work print version of the movie itself was disappointing.  The introduction by Ridley Scott admits to its rough edges, and the fact that it was based on the only remaining print left that they could find - it had deteriorated and needed to be restored.  The movie shakes slightly in the projector throughout the DVD.  The soundtrack does not have all of Vangelis's tracks, and the sound quality is horrible, despite the restoration.<br /><br />The work print movie has a number of small snippets of additional footage and tiny bits of additional  monologue, some of which re-appear in the Final Cut, but from a film standpoint, the main difference from any of the other versions is Roy Batty's death scene which is totally different.  There is a wide angle shot of Batty sitting down as he dies on the rooftop and the spinner car rises up behind him, and Harrison Ford does a totally different, long, and pedantic voice-over (this was the voice-over part that Ridley Scott had agreed to do).  Vangelis's poignant soundtrack is filled in by some \\"temp\\" music (Ridley Scott's words) which sounds like dental office music.  It's an unrefined and impotent version of what would later become the most powerful scene and signature moment of this movie.<br /><br />As for the rest of this DVD collection, the extensive featurettes on the history of this movie are fascinating.  Hearing the original participants talk about it does clear up some myths.  For one thing, there was an even longer version of this movie which has never been seen by more than a select few people  - the very first cut was 4 hours long!<br /><br />Many of the outtakes from this longer version are in Disc 4, including a brief nude scene from Sean Young.  These outtakes are cleverly strung together in what amounts to an alternate universe version of Blade Runner - the Blade Runner movie left on the cutting room floor. But there are only hints of still other missing scenes - for example, a brief flash of a longer love scene in bed appears in one of the \\"Making of\\" featurettes.<br /><br />After all the controversy about the voiceover, it turns out that the voiceover had originally been written into the script by Hampton Fancher.  The first versions of the voiceover were done willingly by both Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott after test screenings of the work print on the public showed that many viewers were completely confused by the movie.  It was only in the final version of the voiceover that Ridley Scott was removed from the film and Harrison Ford was forced to do it in his absence.  Similarly, the \\"happy ending\\" was filmed willingly by Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford because of negative audience reactions elicited during the initial test screenings.<br /><br />I had seen the Final Cut at the Laemmle theater in Los Angeles, and was surprised to find, after all these years, and all the controversy over the lack of a voiceover, that I did not miss the voice-over except perhaps at the scene of Roy Batty's death.  The Final Cut contains a few small snippets of extra scenes that can be found in the work print as well as some digitally replaced improvements that are fairly subtle and well done.  The DVD version is crisp but quite dark, although you can adjust for that with your screen or DVD playing software.<br /><br />As for the two different endings, the two interpretations of whether Decker is a replicant or a human, well, I like both versions equally.<br /><br />And so this great 5-disc set makes clear that there really is no definitive version of Blade Runner.  There is instead only the Blade Runner Multiverse.in the final version of the voiceover that Ridley Scott was removed from the film and Harrison Ford was forced to do it in his absence.

0439813786|4.0|When I first pulled this book off the shelf and thumbed through it, I was hesitant to read it.  It seemed more like a picture book than a novel.  I gave it a chance, and I was glad I did.  The storyline is somewhat predictable in a folktale way - we know the figurative damsel will be saved from the dragon and the hero will ride off into the sunset - but the road was an enjoyable and adventurous one.  Even though I knew how it would turn out, I was eager to see how the puzzle pieces would fall into place.  All in all, it was a fun story with a satisfactory conclusion.    The most incredible thing about this book, however, is the use of the pictures.  This is no simple picture book for the higher reader.  The pictures let you look right into the author's mind and see what he saw when writing the story.  They are intricate and beautiful and each one held surprises for me.  My favorite is one of a close-up of Hugo's face as he looks at the great clock.  The drawing of the face is exquisite - those of us who have taken drawing know how hard it is to draw an eye, let alone capture emotion in it - but if you look closely, the great clock is reflected so perfectly in the pupil that the lines in Hugo's iris become the minutes on the clock face.  It is at once magnificent and profound, and yet easily overlooked.  If each picture is savored and digested, the reader comes away with far more than a novel with pictures.  It is as if one has read a movie and seen a novel.    I believe that the author has created a new genre of fiction with this novel.  Much more than a graphic novel, much more than a picture book, this is a Illustrated Novel and, as a fan of non-adult literature and of art, I look forward to more works from Mr. Selznick.

It's a good weight, so it feels like it costs more than it should, and I get compliments all the time about it. It is also shinier and the polished chrome stands out better in person than pictures depict. I gave it four stars since I can't give it 4.5 stars.

Trente ans après, la voix a perdu de son éclat et de sa brillance, mais le comédien demeure, habile et efficace. Dans ce nouveau Rigoletto, il est entouré d'une équipe formidable : le ténor et la soprano sont jeunes, beaux, et chantent remarquablement bien. Pour Nucci, c'est le Rigoletto de la maturité, et la mise en scène, les décors, les costumes, sont magnifiques. Beau travail, et belle retransmission d'opéra.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|Stranger Than Fiction stars Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, and I thought it was a delightful, refreshing movie. The story is about Harold Crick (Ferrell), a rather lonely and way too fastidious IRS agent. Harold lives an unremarkable life, ruled by his wristwatch, until one day, he begins hearing a voice in his head (Emma Thompson). The voice quite accurately narrates everything he is doing and thinking. At first, Harold considers this simply a nuisance. That is, until the voice mentions his \\"imminent death.\\" (That catches his attention.) Harold immediately begins to try and figure out who the voice is and how he can avoid his sad fate. He goes to Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), a literature teacher, for help. Together, he and Jules identify that he's in a tragedy written by a reculsive (and nearly suicidal) author. Harold tracks down his author, introduces himself as her main character, and begs for his life.<br /><br />When this movie came out, I remember hearing (and thinking) that it sounded eerily reminscent of The Truman Show, but I was wrong, wrong. It is quirkier, and I think ultimately better. It's about the creative process - the author creates a character that is VERY real, and then she is faced with killing this person. And is she really just writing these novels (in which the main character ALWAYS dies) as a way to deal with her own self-destructive tendencies? And, were she to save Harold Crick, what would that mean? Her novel (the story) would fall apart, but Harold would live. I saw a brief interview with the director, and he said he thought the movie was about saving lives - how people save each other's lives every day by doing little things that open up their worlds and encourage people to really live.<br /><br />It was an interesting, entertaining, superbly-cast film, and I encourage you to see it as soon as possible. Performances are wonderful, the script is fresh, and the ideology of it all gives your brain something to chew on for a few days. In addition, it contains some of the cleverest lines I've heard in a while.<br /><br />Rated PG 13, this would be a great family movie.ng to chew on for a few days.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|Finally got around to watching Little Miss Sunshine, and it was just as good as everyone said it was. The film tells the story of the Hoover family - success-obsessed dad Richard (Greg Kinnear), harried mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), wide-eyed (and completely precious) daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), suicidal Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell, in a BRILLIANT turn), a heroin-snorting grandpa (Alan Arkin), and (finally) iron-pumping older brother Dwayne, who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy. Due to a fluke, little Olive is invited to participate in the hotly contested \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" pageant in California. The family loads into their dated VW van to make the several hundred mile trek to get Olive to the competition on time.<br /><br />While there is certainly enough plot to go around, this is primarily a character piece. We see Richard realize that his preoccupation with being a \\"winner\\" is awfully detrimental and none too forgiving. We watch as Frank copes with being dumped by his lover and surpassed by his professional colleagues. We see Dwayne's dream to be a pilot threatened. And through all of the family's losses, we watch them prop each other up and realize that losing isn't really all that bad, as long as you have some good company.<br /><br />EVERYONE in the cast brought their A-game, but the two standouts for me were Breslin and Carrell. Breslin was absolutely adorable as little Olive, who has no reason to believe she can't win the pageant. And she is so trusting and vulnerable that I was totally hooked. Carrell as the jilted gay academic proves once again that he is a veritable Proteus. The guy has range. His melancholy recovery from depression is something to see - smart, likable, witty, in other words, someone we really want to keep around. As odd as it sounds, Frank is, in many ways, the straight man of the piece. (Ha!)<br /><br />At any rate, you will love this movie. I did, and I strongly encourage you to check it out.
B000MZHW40|5.0|[[ASIN:B000MZHW1S Blood Diamond [HD DVD]]]  What a great movie. I'm constantly surprised as to why Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't have an Acadamy Award. He really is a great actor. This movie has everything, a touch of romance, lots of action, and shows the tragedy facing the poor in Africa for the sake of diamonds. This movie is a must see and have for your video library.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|Munich deals with the aftermath of the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Germany (hence the film's name). Once the Israeli state learns the full magnitude of the killings, political and defense leaders assemble a team of men to track down and assassinate those responsible. The movie is about that team of men, what they do, and how it affects them.<br /><br />While all the performeers were excellent, Eric Bana (the protagonist) was particularly fantastic. Bana plays Avner, the leader of the Israeli team. He is a force to be reckoned with in this film, spinning on a dime from nonchalant about his deeds to wracked with guilt, coarsely brutal to meltingly tender. I have not seen Bana in many films (although he was the best part of the too-epic Troy), but he was amazing in Munich. Bana captured the two sides of conflict: a man who feels a duty to avenge his countrymen as well as a man who sees the humanity in his enemy. Just great, great work.<br /><br />The message you come away with in this film - everyone loses. The terrorists killed innocent athletes. The Israeli team is sent to take out the terrorists. But as they track down the men, they realize that even terrorists have their own dreams of a homeland. They have wives, children. And when they kill the men responsible for the Munich murders, new men take their places within the terrorist organization. And the men of the Israeli team are left broken and haunted by what they have done. There is no end, just a violent rabbit hole that keeps on wending its way through the Middle East. I think that anyone who has followed world events would agree that this seems to be an accurate assessment.<br /><br />This film is definitely worth watching, but it's not popcorn cinema. This film is a great example of how film can be riveting (if not exactly entertaining) and teach you something, make you think, and perhaps even change you.
B000SUKPKM|5.0|Just like it says--this is the best of the best.  Can't beat it by any means.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|I love it, and my son does too.  It is quite loud -- I could maybe replace the motor.... But he runs it for 20 minutes as he's falling asleep, and the noise level seems to be ok for him.  The solar system shuts off after 20 minutes and the moon shuts off after 30 min, so it works well as a pre-bedtime thing.  When I saw the photo on the box, I assumed it went over the room lamp, but it doesn't.  You need to drill two holes in the ceiling to mount it (really one would do).  Also, I recommend using the next size up drill bit -- 3/8\\".  I bent the (cheap) toggle bolt trying to install.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Well, I just saw \\"Sicko.\\" At times I found tears coming to my eyes. If you can see this film and not feel moved to the core of your being by the tragedies shown, and by the good work of those in other countries who helped some of the victims, you are less than human.<br /><br />Michael Moore did a very good job. As he said, you can't show the 25,000 stories of awful struggles and tragedies with the medical system that he received, in two hours. But he showed enough to remind us clearly why medical bills are the #1 cause of bankruptcies in the US, and how the current system actually can and does kill anyone who does not have the almighty $ to back them. And when it came to the comparison with other systems, it was smart to begin with the most \\"acceptable\\", or at least closest, system - Canada - and then examine Britain and then France and then (gasp!) Cuba! Norway's amazing society was left as a \\"special feature\\" since it is even further removed from US concepts.<br /><br />I have lived and worked in Britain, Canada, and the US (last 25 years) so I have experienced all three systems.  I had cancer treatment in Britain (many years ago), a daughter born in Canada, and thank the Lord no major medical events in the US. I just don't get it. How is that Americans are so blinded by the LYING propaganda of the insurance companies and the lobbyists and the politicians that they don't SEE what an appallingly inefficient and UNFAIR system they have?<br /><br />In my experience, although of course individuals are all different, in general Americans are kind and generous. Why is there this blank spot about the meaning of the words \\"society\\" and \\"social?\\" They come from a root meaning \\"companion.\\" We are all companions in life's journey. Why is America the only developed country not to feel that this group of traveling companions should ensure some basic level of care for its members? And how can doctors work for insurance companies that reward them financially for denying care? Many must be violating their Hippocratic oath every day.<br /><br />Another emotion the film provokes is anger. Anger at the evil scumbags who tell so many lies to safeguard their interests, at the politicians who have let themselves become puppets of corporate greedheads instead of responding to the often-expressed wishes of their constituents, and of course at those who see other people's health as the hunting-ground for them to make their multiple millions.<br /><br />The only thing I found slightly frustrating was his pose as a \\"typical American,\\" incredulous at the benefits those in other societies enjoy. I suppose he had to do that to keep the dialog alive, but surely he must have known beforehand how the other systems worked; that's why he was moved to make \\"Sicko\\" and how he was able to plan it. Still, I suppose if you are saying to a Frenchwoman \\"So everyone has a minimum of five weeks paid vacation\\" and she just says \\"that's right\\" it has less impact from the filmic point of view.<br /><br />He also could have done more to answer the objection \\"But it will cost a fortune in taxes.\\" Indirectly, he did so by showing the comfortable lifestyle of a typical French middle-class family, who didn't  have an enormous income but clearly lived well and comfortably, obviously not suffering from any tax hit, and clearly with much less stress than their US counterparts. However, a main answer is of course that the gigantic insurance bureaucracy wastes about a third of all the dollars spent on health care. In single-payer national systems this goes down to a tiny fraction. It's not a question of replacing private paperwork by \\"government\\" paperwork. The paperwork GOES AWAY! No policies, no EOBs, no bills, no co-pays, no deductibles. And over and above the system cost, you also get rid of the immense cost in individuals' time and energy dealing with all that nonsense. It's so ironic that the naysayers try to scare us with \\"bureaucracy!\\"<br /><br />Then also, from the tax point of view, the naysayers forget that employers no longer have to pay those huge premiums for their employees. That money is now available to be paid to the employees and will more than cover any increase in individual taxes needed for the less wasteful national system. The \\"cost\\" thing is a non-issue.oyers no longer have to pay those huge premiums for their employees. That money is now available to be paid to the employees and will more than cover any increase in individual taxes needed for the less wasteful national system. The \\"cost\\" thing is a non-issue.
0790731452|4.0|This is a great comedy classic that for whatever reason is not embraced with the mainstream audiences, but more embraced as a cult film.  This film is a must if you are building your classic comedy DVD library.  The looks on the aliens' faces are funny by themselves and when the aliens speak it is hilarious!
0307275639|5.0|The movie was exceptional.......the book even more so. Short and very powerful, recommended reading for all.
B000063DHK|5.0|If you haven't bought this AWESOME CD yet, Go out now and BUY it Immediately!!  This is the best live CD you will ever get, if you are a metal fan. Raw power, emotion and chops. This is the best live album ever, in the world.  The version of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is perfect, as well as the rest of the songs on this exceptional release.  Can't rate it high enough...
B00005JKJA|4.0|..........and you will try to analysis over and over in your head.  Most of the movie until the box is opened is a dream.  Notice the camera work till then.........its kind of floats like a dream.  A movie you cannot stop watching and will want to watch again.   And Watts is beautiful.
B000002J09|3.0|You know what? I don't like \\"Black Dog.\\" There, I said it! I don't like that repetitive riff, which sounds kinda cool the first time you hear it but gets duller and duller with each successive time around. I hate Jimmy Page's guitar tone, which is annoyingly flat and fuzzy and metallic. I can't stand Robert Plant's vocals, which are a screechy and irritating attempt to be raw and sexual. The lyrics are in the same spirit. Zep fans, feel free to crucify me.    And that's not the only song on this beloved album that I'm not fond of- \\"Four Sticks\\" has some nice churning rhythms, but it gets dull after a very small amount of time. Same goes for \\"Misty Mountain Hop.\\" Oh, and \\"Stairway To Heaven?\\" It's just ok- yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong, it has some very beautiful moments, especially in its middle section. In general, the song features some of Page's finest guitar playing (especially toward the end) and Plant's most tolerable singing, as well as plenty of gorgeous melodies and a quintessentially Zeppelin-esque epic feel. But even so, Plant's lyrics are more pretentious than anything else, often slipping into banalities and melodrama (\\"And a new day will dawn for those who stand long/ And the forest will echo with laughter\\"), and the usual fairies-and-elves type faux mysticism that made so much of Robert Plant's writing so contrived and annoying. And anyway, it simply can't hold my interest long enough to justify its eight-minute length. Zep fans, feel free to burn my village.    But I do love a lot of this album- the searing, apocalyptic blues of \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" is a major highlight, as the genuinely beautiful \\"Going To California.\\" \\"The Battle Of Evermore\\" is a brilliantly rendered piece of English dream-folk, with hypnotic melodies and a wonderful mandolin line. Plus, it's got a duet with Sandy Denny. Cool! And of course, there's \\"Rock & Roll,\\" which is a raw, sweaty chunk of exactly what its title promises. So, this isn't my favorite Led Zeppelin album-I much prefer the debut and Houses Of The Holy. Zep fans, please forgive me.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|In my opinion one of the greatest movies of all time.  My personal favorite (The Exorcist a close 2nd). A book and movie that hit a nerve.  What is worst than being eaten alive while out of your element?  To this day Jaws is still part of our American culture, especially the music.  A fast paced movie, a complete movie with great acting.  How was Robert Shaw not nominated for best actor or even supporting actor?  How was Spielberg not nominated for best director?  A disgrace.  Pretty much based on the 1916 shark scare at the New Jersey Shore and the capturing of a 18 foot, 5,000 pound great white shark off Montauk, NY in 1964.  This movie is a realistic account of a rogue shark terrorizing a New England resort (in book its a Long Island town) that is scary, full of suspense and fun.  While the ending with the oxygen tank is very Hollywood, its simply a movie for the ages. (Also anyone that might say the shark does not look real, professional people familiar with Great White sharks designed the shark from an actual great white.  And look at pics of actual great whites, they don't look real. For example with shark week and all those jumping great white shots and others photos, compared them to some shots in Jaws and even the outtakes.  You will see what a good job they did.  And the cage scene that is mostly a live white shark.  5 STARS!!!
B000VR824S|5.0|Crossroads is a compilation of a wide variety of guitar based performances from the 2007 Festival.  This has great variety, some classic performances by some of the most accomplished rock and blues artists of the past 30 years.  Overall quality of the video and sound was excellent.  Entertaining Emcee work by Bill Murray.  If you enjoy top quality classic guitar riffs, worth a look and listen.
B0002J4ZWS|4.0|A great movie.  A complete movie.  Prehaps the only change that could of been made is to change the ending.  Its a little \\"too happy\\".  I think the movie could of ended with Red in the bus as its goes over the hill and you are left to wonder if he ever gets to see his good friend at the beach in Mexico.
B000M341QE|1.0|Bottom Line - Poorly edited, mediocre acting (actually deCaprio was great and I thought he was going to be the problem in the movie considering his performance in the Aviator - not his fault he just should not have taken on that role).  Also, the movie was just a good old boys call for \\"come on over, you can be in the movie too\\".  However, I don't think that even with good casting this movie could have been saved.  But regardless, Mark Walberg was terrible and his acting as always was unbelievable and distracting - they should have cast his brother in this role (better actor of the two - actually the only true actor in the family).  Jack should have gone to a Laker game, Martin Sheen should have gone to a protest, Alec Baldwin should have filmed another Saturday Night Live episode, and Matt Damon and Anthony Anderson should get out of the acting business.  Ok - Matt was good in the Bourne series - but this role was not for him.  You would never have known that Marty's hands were involved in this movie.  He has arguably made some of the best movies of all time only to throw together this mess (the Oscar award was clearly a mercy offering).  The movie was boring, and then everyone gets killed within 5 minutes of the end in one minute increments.
079073804X|5.0|If the ultimate question in our life is, \\"is there life after death\\" and since this movie is based on actual cases of possessions of evil spirits then if you believe then this is a very important movie and answers that question.  Yes at times its dated and a visual assault but is so intelligent, well made with excellent acting, shocking and highly religious.  Remember this movie was nominated for 11 Oscars.  How it did not win Best Picture is a disgrace (The Sting won, nice picture but not a classic like The Exorcist.)  The Exorcist is 5 STARS.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|This had all the best Police songs I was looking for.  Almost all the songs on here were great, plus it was a great deal.  In addition to the two CDs, there was also a fold-out poster, which was a great added bonus.  Overall, this is truly a great find.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I've always thought that the narrative was weak. Right from the start with the cornball dialogue between the police captain and Harrison Ford.<br /><br />But that's not why I've seen this movie a dozen times. I keep watching Blade Runner over and over again for the way Ridley Scott, along with others, constructed such a believable vision of a future LA, filled with people, lights, junk, and noise.<br /><br />For that, this is the best version of the movie I've seen. The re-mastered blu-ray looks amazing. Every scene has so much more detail. The scene in which Sean Young shows up at Harrison Ford's apartment, you can see the RCA sign blinking red out of the window behind her. And the smoke! There's smoke everywhere in this movie. Where in previous releases it obscures everything else in the frame, in this version you can see the smoke wafting around and above everything else on the screen.<br /><br />So, if you're not a fan of Blade Runner, you're still not going to like it. But if you are, you have to get one of the HD versions of this movie. And like other reviewers have mentioned, I'm just bummed that the other versions, especially the workprint, weren't also remastered in HD (but that's a quibble).
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I couldn't ask for a better Christmas gift.  This CD was something I both gave and received.  It has all of Garth's greatest hits, and I loved every minute of it.  It had all of his old classics, plus his newer hits as well.  There really wasn't a song on here I didn't already know and love.  This makes a great buy for anyone who loves Garth Brooks.

B000K15VSA|4.0|I'm giving this packaged edition four stars, so I'm not trying to berate what's been released here. Yet,I'm a fan of this film, and after 25 years, expected a lot more. It looks to me as if the \\"money men\\" still have their say as to what the public is willing to digest when it comes to studio releases. Either that or Ridley has lost his vision after so many years.  What I am referencing here is what was undoubtedly left on the cutting room floor. It's a fact that Ridley battled the bean counters many times during the course of production. So where in this \\"definitive set\\" are the scenes which were scrapped?? They're still on the cutting room floor (as far as I can tell).  Camerons \\"The Abyss\\" added nearly 40 minutes in it's directors cut and made a huge difference.  Even \\"Aliens\\" had quite a few minutes added which made that version much more plausible.  Lynchs' \\"Dune\\" left hours on the cutting room floor which might have made that story what it should have been.  I guess the bean counters decided our attention spans were just too short to do this film the justice it deserved, and Ridley went along with the ride.
B000ICLRHK|3.0|Movie is great.  Acting is pretty good.  Video quality for Blu-ray DVD is poor.  There is no extra material (as seen on the Special Edition DVD).  But it looks better than the regular DVD version.  A buy if you love the movie.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Received this quickly and is an awesome soundtrack! Which makes sense since the movie was fantastic. Highly recommended, especially if you are a Beatle's fan!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Bruce and the E-Street band return to true form. Magic is a solid piece of work from start to end. My personal pick, \\"Girls In Their Summer Close\\", asong that I have to play several times before moving on with the rest of the disk!

1594489505|5.0|Again this author enabled me to feel what it is like being a woman in Afghanistan. There is sadness, yes. But also courage and a love of their country. If ever we are not at war, I'd love to visit there. Grab a hanky and read!
B00008NRLX|5.0|There are few albums by any musicians that reward repeated listenings as much as this one. Almost every song here is a tuneful well-crafted gem. Tampa to Tulsa may be the one I find myself inadvertantly singing more often than any other, but Stumbling Through the Dark and several others are also masterpieces of songcraft. It's a tragedy that the Jayhawks never got the commercial success that they merited. If music this good can't win, then the radio industry and the music companies just have failed us.

B00014TJ7K|5.0|Cloud Nine is a great release from George Harrison, who, in 1987, was seeking to re-establish himself as an artist. With essentially a newfound focus to propel his solo career at the top as he did seventeen years prior with All Things Must Pass, Harrison enlisted the services of Jeff Lynne of ELO fame as the co-producer for this project. Alongside Harrison's  guitar were to be the key instrumental contributions of Eric Clapton, Elton John, Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, and Jim Keltner, among others.    The songs are timeless, and the instrumentations are very nicely arranged. In this collection, the tracks are representative of the various phases Harrison was artistically going through since his early Beatle days. Fish on the Sand, Cloud Nine, and the number one hit, Got My Mind Set on You, an obscure early 60s Rudy Clark song that Harrison actually wanted to record as a Beatle, comprise material reminiscent of those pre-Sergeant Pepper days. When We Was Fab and Breath Away from Heaven are interesting tracks, blending together the sitar sound that was often Harrison's trademark since late 1966 with traces of the ELO-type production that was of none other than Jeff Lynne.    For those who were hoping for a bit of the All Things Must Pass sound from Cloud Nine, That's What It Takes, the second track, has a mid-tempo, bluesy sound with excellent Clapton guitar added and thus parallels the All Things Must Pass tunes I'd Have You Anytime and Beware of Darkness. Just for Today, lyrically and musically, is a poignant song that has a ring of both resolve and finality to it in the style of the All Things Must Pass title track.    In retrospect, I say that, roughly twenty years after its chart success, Cloud Nine was a return to basics release with a contemporary sound that would provide a touch of retrospection, which I think brought to life the strengths of this masterpiece without having it stuck in any particular decade. In this twenty-first century, it sounds just as fresh and new as it ever did.      A sad note: Cloud Nine would end up being the very last solo work that George Harrison would issue during his lifetime. But what a way to summarize the career of so talented a performer who, in 2003, would be ranked #21 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.    Looking at the catalogue of his works,one can definitely agree that George Harrison was a one-of-a-kind performer who was anything but a one-trick pony.    Once again, thanks for the memories, George.
0553583182|5.0|Although this book was first published in 1963, it's as powerful today as it ever was.  Dr. Murphy explains how you can change your life by changing your beliefs.  He provides in-depth information on how to  make use of the power of your subconscious mind.<br /><br />For instance, he tells you to begin to sow thoughts of peace, happiness, right action, goodwill and prosperity...to think about these things with quiet conviction.  You will then attract these things into your life.<br /><br />He goes on to say that once you learn to control your thought processes, you can apply the powers of your subconscious mind to any problem.  This works because you are consciously cooperating with the infinite power and law that governs everything.<br /><br />After explaining how the subconscious mind works and giving examples of mental healings from modern and ancient times, he goes on to show you how to get the results you want in areas like:<br />- wealth<br />- relationships<br />- removing fear<br />- staying young in spirit, etc.<br /><br />This is a book that has timeless appeal.  I've read it several times, and will re-read it over the years as a reminder of how to tap into the power of the mind to create a life of my choosing.
B000KX0IOK|4.0|Dan Dunne is a gifted history teacher in an inner city school. Or he could be, if his crack habit was not getting in the way of his personal life and his profession. He also coaches the school's losing girl's basketball team with energy and spirit, but no success. His star pupil, Drey (Shareeka Epps) learns of his secret life and struggles as that life intersects her own. Her dad is long gone, her brother is in prison after taking the fall for a drug bust, and Frank, the guy who should be in jail, wants to help Drey's family by getting her into the business. Any interest Dunne has in reaching out to Drey is subverted by his need to hook up with his source.<br /><br />This is a fascinating story whose story arcs are anything but neat and clean. Drey is appalled at the effect of drugs on her family, but drawn toward its aura of success and belonging. Drey's mom wants to raise good kids but is hobbled by a punishing workload and absence of her husband. Crack heads do what they have to do to get their next fix.<br /><br />The story has an inevitability that unreels slowly and is all too real. The ending does not provide a resolution, but offers, perhaps a glimmer of hope.<br /><br />A fascinating, well-written, believable, and genuinely affecting film that touches on the intersection of hope and frailty, seasoned with issues of race and class. Another great turn by Ryan Gosling as Dunne. Kudos too to Anthony Mackie as crack dealer Frank.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This set is wonderful -- and a lifesaver on dull winter evenings. It's expensive yes, but when you average out the cost of nightly entertainment, the Gilmore Girls Complete Series Collection is a real bargain in one convenient carrying case.     While recovering from major surgery in 2001-02, I started watching this clever series on the WB network and was totally charmed by the quirky characters populating Stars Hollow. I was equally impressed with the superb performances by Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel. Their witty banter and the show's ongoing plots were lively and well-written. And the mythical Stars Hollow completely fulfills the fantasy of anyone who's ever dreamed of living in a small town with heart. Sadly, after I recovered, I lost track of the Gilmore Girls, so I was thrilled when the complete series came out this year. And just in time -- since my favorite series on ABC are few and far between, thanks to the writers strike!  Now I don't miss primetime TV. I'm happily revisiting Stars Hollow and catching up to some of the best episodes ever on television.
0061124265|4.0|Yes indeed!  I finished this cover to cover at the bookstore while waiting to pick up my friend from the hospital (who btw is a new father congrats!)    First and foremost as a reader: understand that this book has been translated from Portuguese.  Coelho is a Brazilian and of course their native language isn't english, so for all the elitist reviews here saying this is not a real piece of literature then I feel sorry for you.  I'm sorry because you can't let your guard down and enjoy books for what they are.    For me, I absolutely love books that provoke strong emotions, deep thought, and introspection.  This book hit me closer than any other because I've had issues regarding mental health so you better believe that the whole spectrum of emotions was felt.      I know I don't fall in love with every book I read; if I don't like it then I'll just say, \\"I didn't like it.\\"  Appreciate the work and thought thats been put through and move on!
B0007939NO|4.0|The stagey Brigadoon isn't short of flaws (not least collecting some of the worst Scottish accents in movie history), but it's so beautifully staged that it carries the day, gaping plot holes and all. The use of CinemaScope is superb and the backlot shooting somehow seems perfectly appropriate for this piece of Highland whimsy and post-war wishful thinking. Strange to think that the film's unexpected failure heralded the beginning of the end of the MGM musical (and led to The Heather in the Hills among other numbers being cut in many overseas territories so they could dump the film in a double-bill!).    The special edition DVD boasts a good widescreen transfer and a fine selection of extras, including deleted numbers Come To Me, Bend To Me, From This Day On and Sword Dance and an audio-only outtake of There But For You Go I as well as the original theatrical trailer, but sadly therecording sessions that were included as an audio extra on the old MGM/UA laserdisc have not been included.

B000VR824S|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it...good camera work and great music, but my non-guitar playing friend's eyes glazed over before the halfway point.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Ok, so maybe you think that a free universal healthcare system is a flawed idea. Maybe you disagree with the solution offered by the movie. Maybe being sick in France, the UK and Cuba isn't as described in the film. Maybe all these things the movie shows are simply lies. Fine, you may have a point.<br /><br />But did they make up the people who actually died due to the ridiculously flawed current health system? Because if they didn't, and those people actually died because hospitals and doctors capable of healing them wouldn't do so because they weren't insured or didn't have enough coverage, then no matter what the correct answer to fix the issue is, the remaining absolute truth is \\"THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG!\\" Very wrong...<br /><br />Have we become so selfish and self-centered that, unless something like this happens to us or someone really close to us, we feel the subject isn't worthy of our attention? We sit comfortably in our current healthy state, judging the movie because Michael Moore is this and that, or things aren't quite as pretty at the other places as he made them seem, and we simply ignore the fact that real people are dying? That volunteers who left the comfort of their homes to help the huge mess that was 9/11, as we sat safely in our homes whining about how afwul the whole ordeal was, are now suffering from health issues brought by their participation in helping people they didn't even know and now no one is helping them?<br /><br />I wanted to watch this movie because I already thought health insurance companies are a mob. And, like the mafia, they kill people. They just do it differently. How can those people sleep at night? And how can the government allow this to happen? This is disgusting!<br /><br />I hate dramas and I don't watch movies intended to make people cry, but I held a knot in my throat throughout most of the movie. These are people, just like you or me, whose lives were either taken or seriously damaged because they weren't able to afford medical treatments they needed. We are not talking about breast augmentation surgeries, or nose jobs, we are talking cancer patients!<br /><br />I am fortunate enough to be a very healthy person and to have a full-time job that covers me under their insurance.

0780626494|1.0|The premise of this movie was interesting, but instead of exploring the many  comedic possibilities of a stuck-in-the-50's family navigating the 1990's (and the potentially rich sub-plot of the archbishop and the cult that developed around the elevator) it languished in the tired old formula of feisty girl meets boy, girl plays hard to get because she can't understand it was love at first sight and HE'S the man she's waited for all along, yawn yawn yawn. And Alicia Silverstone...somebody please get that girl some acting lessons!    Watched this one only because I had the flu and was too tired to do much else. Besides, it was on TV so it didn't cost me anything except my time.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie is flat out wonderful.  A wonderful story accompanied by just beautiful animation makes this movie such a joy to watch.
B000A6T262|5.0|an excellent box set. I bought it for my dad and he absolutely loved it. Unlike most other collections, it still has all of the bonus features for each movie, so you're not just stuck with the \\"10 pack\\" that's more expensive than buying them individually.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|How refreshing and beautiful.  A story of love that isn't cheapened by sex.  The music is moving and I can't wait to get the soundtrack.  The film has a certain amatuer feel to it, that was entirely appropriate and didn't distract from the story.  Two people who fall in love but can't do anything about it.  They sadly move on with their lives, and with the audiences best wishes and hopes.

B000Y179KO|4.0|I am an Eagles fan but it would have been VERY possible for me not to like a new Eagles album in 2007!  After the last Don Henley solo album which I heard he abandon the new Eagles album project out of frustration, and went and made \\"Inside Job\\".  Thank goodness because almost any material like that would have spoiled this album in a minute.  Not that Don Henley's contributions on the new Eagles album doesnt have solo characteristics, they do!  Matter of fact, so does Glen Fry's material as well.  Joe Walsh and Timothy Schmidt's songs sound MORE like Eagles songs than Fry or Henley.  But that doesnt matter here because a GOOD part of this CD are very good indeed!  I NEVER expected another Hotel California or even one of the countryish early Eagles releases (even though they made Eden with more of a country feel).  It's the harmony of singers and musicianship even in the solo like songs that are extremley well done.  How Long is a very good example with Henley and Fry interchanging vocals and every member singing harmonies.  A lot of time and effort went into this project, and although it falls well short of the best classic eagles releases, it is is a very ambitious effort for these aging rockers.  The vocals are amazing for guys going on 60 years old, nobody can say the voices here arent impressive.  The production work of the album is also first rate, in addition to the instrumentation and arrangements.  Probably the biggest complaint I could say is a lot of the songs strongly resemble Don Henley and Glen Frey solo songs.  There are also a few klunkers at the end that shouldnt have made the cut.  But even still, the songs are so well delivered and performed, you just can't help liking this CD!  I guess my expectations were not high enough to expect another Hotel California, I knew it wouldnt happen.  This is 2007! But this CD should almost certaintly hold up The Eagles perfect record of hit releases which was last realized with \\"Hell Freezes Over\\".  The songs aremuch in the vain of the new songs on that CD as well as \\"Hole In The World\\" from the \\"Very best Of\\".  Given all that now, the eagles have now provided a VERY nice collection of 90's and 2000's new music that should make the new tours memorable!  The farewell \\"It's Your World Now\\" perhaps wont be the closing theme to The Eagles career afterall with the kind of support and appeal their fans have, this band could go another 10 years right before it all crashes and lands in the sea (as Don Henley has recently stated).
B000VWYNNW|5.0|I have to admit that I was never a big fan of the original album, I found it to be quite boring after awhile and was never really thrilled with it's lack of tunage. To me it had way to many missing pieces and just bludgeoned the listener to death with the same sections of some songs played over and over again until it hurt.<br /><br />Some people love Zeppelin live, others think they suck! I am one of those who loves the way the band sounded live. The energy and passion of their live shows is almost indescribable. Check out their 2003 DVD release to see what I mean. It's truly an amazing view and listen.<br /><br />This remastered version of The Song Remains The Same sounds fantastic. It also has more tunes on it which is what really brings it to life. The combination of more tunes and better production is simply a unbeatable combination. Some have said that this concert was not one of Zeppelin's better efforts and I would agree to some extent. However the fact remains that any Zeppelin remastered and added upon release is a thousand times better than most stuff out their today. Some of the tunes have been edited, but again, it's a more enjoyable listen overall and isn't that the point here?<br /><br />New tunes to be found on this release are as follows: Black Dog, which includes Bring It On Home, Over The Hills and Far Away, Misty Mountain Hop, Since I've Been Loving You, The Ocean, Heartbreaker and Whole Lotta Love.<br /><br />Any Zep fan should find something to like here and maybe even truly enjoy. I know I did even with the edits/fix ups as I like to call them. I'm glad I picked this cd up and gave this concert another chance!
B00008QSA5|5.0|Interesting album to begin with, but the remixing and additional tracks it is a must. For me anyway....
B00000JPYQ|5.0|If you're into hard rock and terrific guitar licks, this is an absolute must have title.  Captured in their prime, Strangers serves as UFO's best effort live or otherwise.  One listen to tracks like Mother Mary, Lights Out and This Kid will have you shaking your head as to how these guys ever slipped under the radar.  Solid toe-tappin' tunes from front to back.  Excellent sound quality, especially for a live releases.  Without a doubt, one of the best hard rock live albums of all time!
B0011Z7K3I|4.0|When it comes to guitar gods, none of them have really known how to shine brightly like Eric Clapton. On his own, and as a member of Derek & The Dominoes and Cream, he has shown for five decades what it is really like to be a Rock legend. But, his work on Warner Brothers during the 80's and 90's, proved to be a far departure from his legendary tracks like Layla and albums like Ocean Boluevard. Nevertheless, he kept on going, and made some of the best music of his career, and that can be shown on this album which is now available for downloading through Amazon.com's MP3's.<br /><br />The 1999 Eric Clapton greatest hits album Clapton Chronicles: The Best Of Eric Clapton is a solo effort of Eric's strongest set of solo songs that have been all about the heart and soul from an artist who had embattled drug addiction, the horrific loss of his son Connor, and a rebuilding of a music legend. The songs here have a lot of soul in them and include a lot of great tracks like his lesser-known 80's hits like It's In The Way You Use It from the Tom Cruise film The Color Of Money and Forever Man, to his comeback era in the 90's with his heartfelt ballad Tears In Heaven, and his collaboration with Babyface on Change The World which won Record Of The Year in 1997. There are other great songs that were shown here well including Blue Eyes Blue from Julia Roberts film Runaway Bride, Bad Love and his MTV Unplugged live performance of Layla. Sadly though, the album does overlook a few great songs including Motherless Child off his From The Cradle album, and his other standouts like Wonderful Tonight.<br /><br />Despite a few great tracks that were overshadowed, Clapton Chronicles: The Best Of Eric Clapton isn't a bad greatest hits album. While it isn't shown as well as his 2007 Complete Clapton hits album, it still stands out well for anyone who has yet to really hear the heart and soul that has still shown what Eric Clapton has been made of for all these years. I really recommend you get a good listen to this album, and get down with this Bad Love.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2-<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: Bto this album, and get down with this Bad Love.

B000089RV6|5.0|If you're looking for a handful of tunes that are filled with heart-felt insightful lyrics meant to change the world, you're in the wrong place.  If you instead want an in-your-face rocker that'll kick start pretty much any party, this is the one you want to plop into the CD player.  Back in Black deserves to be on every rock n roller's short list of best ever albums!  Yea...the lyrics are filled with innuendo and sexual overtones, but as far as 'thumpin' classics sure to get even the dullest member in the crowd rockin', this baby warrants very serious consideration.  If you like 70's rock n roll...this one's a must have!
B000059TFO|5.0|brilliant gripping movie. gene hackman at his finest. watched this movie  probably 5-6 times and it never gets old. not sure of the director but kudo's to that individual. 5 stars
B00000099Y|5.0|I bought this album right after it came out back in 1996.  Back then, I wasn't sure if I really loved rock or not.  I was really into Nirvana, but I hadn't really branched out into heavy hard rock albums yet.  I'm so glad I did.....<br /><br />Th album opens up so hauntingly with Stinkfist and roars to a close with Thrid Eye.  There are so many almost perfect songs on this cd. What more can you say?  BUY IT!

As far as story lines go and quality of acting, the twisted humor, superb!

B00008QSA5|3.0|I remember when this album came out - my few guitar playing friends raved about it. Recently I was getting a Butterfield album and also picked this up. Not very impressed with it.
B000VR824S|5.0|Having loved the first crossroads dvd, I was curious to see how this held up and it exceeded my expectations by a long shot. It's all good and it all works. The only critiscm I'll give it was there is bit too much Steve Winwood for my taste. Maybe 1 or 2 songs less. He is a great talent and the reunion was historic setting the stage for the February concert dates with EC. Derek Trucks was huge, B.B. King was uplifting, nice to see Sonny Landreth, but Albert Lee and the country portion were a huge suprise.  This set will not disappoint!
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|I just purchased this item a couple of days ago, and already I'm impressed. Not only does it contain songs from his days with the Jackson 5 all the way to the Invincible album, it also has rare and unreleased songs from albums tracing back to The Jacksons. There are four discs of music, and one DVD of the Dangerous Tour Live in Bucharest. I feel that some of the discs are missing some of his greatest singles such as In The Closet, Working Day & Night, Another Part Of Me, Liberian Girl, Leave Me Alone, Human Nature, and I Can't Help It. These are only a few to name, but here's the list:  Disc 1  1. I Want You Back (Jackson 5)  2. ABC (Jackson 5)  3. I'll Be There (Jackson 5)  4. Got To Be There  5. I Wanna Be Where You Are (Jackson 5)  6. Ben  7. Dancing Machine (Single Version)  8. Enjoy Yourself (The Jacksons)  9. Ease On Down The Road (duet with Diana Ross) - this song is from The Wiz.  10. You Can't Win - also from The Wiz  11. Shake A Body (an early demo of Shake Your Body [Down to the Ground])  12. Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground) [Single Version]  13. Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough   14. Rock With You - one of my favorite tracks from the Off The Wall era  15. Off The Wall - another favorite  16. She's Out Of My Life - if you want to cry, listen to this song.  17. Sunset Driver (Demo)  18. Lovely One (The Jacksons)  19. This Place Hotel (The Jacksons) - it's usually known as the Heartbreak Hotel.   Disc 2  1. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' - Mama se, mama sa, mama koosa! Another jam by the legend and a good song to dance to.  2. The Girl Is Mine (feat. Paul McCartney)   3. Thriller - I used to be afraid of the music video when I was a child.  4. Beat It  5. Billie Jean  6. P.Y.T. (Original Version/Demo) - this isn't the same P.Y.T. from the Thriller album. This version sounds more like a ballad than a dance song. I really like this version.   7. Someone In The Dark - I think that you can find this song on the E.T. soundtrack. This song also sounds really good.8. State Of Shock (The Jacksons with Mick Jagger)  9. Scared Of The Moon (Demo)  10. We Are The World (Demo) - Michael is the only one singing in this version. It still sounds really good.  11. We Are Here To Change The World  Disc 3  1. Bad  2. The Way You Make Me Feel  3. Man In The Mirror  4. I Just Can't Stop Loving You (feat Siedah Garrett)  5. Dirty Diana  6. Smooth Criminal  7. Cheater (Demo)  8. Dangerous (Early Version)  9. Monkey Business  10. Jam  11. Remember The Time - one of my favorite songs from Dangerous. I also like the video which includes Eddie Murphy, Iman, and Magic Johnson.  12. Black Or White  13. Who Is It (IHS Mix)  14. Someone Put Your Hand Out - a really nice, smooth ballad that is an unreleased track from the Dangerous era. During one of Michael's costume changes from the Dangerous Tour, you can hear the pianist playing this song.  Disc 4  1. You Are Not Alone  2. Stranger In Moscow - I really like this song, and Michael makes a lot of references about the USSR.   3. Childhood (Theme from Free Willy 2) - this song is really deep. Michael sings about how he never had a childhood. One of his lyrics states \\"people say I'm not okay, cause I love such elementary things, it's been my fate to compensate, for the childhood I've never known,,,\\"  4. On The Line - a nice ballad produced by Babyface.   5. Blood On The Dancefloor  6. Fall Again (demo)  7. In The Back  8. Unbreakable  9. You Rock My World  10. Butterflies  11. Beautiful Girl (demo) - this song sounds very melodic.   12. The Way You Love Me - this song also sounds really nice.  13. We've Had Enough  Disc 5: The Dangerous Tour DVD  1. Jam  2. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'  3. Human Nature  4. Smooth Criminal  5. I Just Can't Stop Loving You  6. She's Out Of My Life  7. I Want You Back/The Love You Save  8. I'll Be There  9. Thriller  10. Billie Jean  11. Working Day & Night  12. Beat It  13. Will You Be There  14. Black Or White  15. Heal The World  16. Man In The Mirror  This box set of Michael's ultimate collection is very good. It's missing some of his great singles, but overall it's really not a bad collection.   9.
0618154248|4.0|I gave this box set to my 3 year old nephew and he really loves to hear the stories about Curious George; however, I was a little disappointed that these were not the same stories that I remember as a child. The one book \\"Curious George Rides\\" takes tiny pieces from several stories to make one book. I would have been good to have known that before I purchased the set.
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|All the people complaining about the 'death grunts' and 'noise' of this album ARE NOT TRUE METAL FANS.  This is an amazing album and if you consider yourself a metalhead, you cannot go wrong with this album.  This album was my introduction to Epica.  I have listened to past albums and cannot help but be a little dissapointed. I am absolutely in LOVE with this album.  The vocals and music couldn't be more perfect.  What an amazing experience.  I cannot wait to see them in concert at the end of January!!
015603252X|5.0|This memoir by the Israeli novelist Amoz Oz is a fascinating depiction of both European and Israeli Jews. Although the author was born in Israel, his parents and relatives were all European Jews displaced by the events leading up to World War II.The graphic depiction of what anti-semitism does to an individual explains the need for a Jewish state more fully than any essay could, and the history of the first war against the Jews by the Arabs, aided openly by the British army which then controlled Palestine, and which started the very evening in November, 1947 of the U.N. vote to establish a Jewish homeland, not, as I previously thought, in May, 1948, when the state of Israel was officially declared, lends credence to the unfortunate belief that the Arabs will never accept the state of Israel. This makes the book sound incredibly sad, and of course it is in one sense. But in another, by creating the milieu of these early settlers in Jerusalem and their intellectual strengths and interests, and also the new Jew of the kibbutz, to which Oz went after the death of his mother and his father's remarriage, and where he lived and wrote for 30 years, the book turns out to be the best one I have read about this frantic period of Jewish history.

B0000AQS0F|3.0|I have to say that I have never seen so many good reviews (or reviews period) for a TV show, especially one that wasn't watched by all that many people.  That said, this show just didn't do it for me.  It was fun to watch but I can't say it amounted to much.  There is some comedy and some action and even a little drama, but this show cannot compare to some of Joss Whedon's other shows (cough-->Buffy).  I also get the feeling that the show didn't quite know where it was going.  It's hard for me to say what exactly is wrong with this series.  It's regularly witty and entertaining, and it possesses a sort of charisma.  The thing is I didn't really connect emotionally with the show; after watching the last episode I wasn't really pining for more.  Still, the show is fun and if you want a more polished product check out the movie, which in my opinion is pretty darn good.

0805079831|5.0|One of the more important works of recent memory. Author Klein manages to put a number of seemingly disparate happenings into a coherent perspective. From Chile (1973) to Bolivia (1985) to Russia of the 1990's, and especially to Iraq (2003) and post-Katrina, USA, she shows how  the tide of American-sponsored privatization has swept the globe, reducing government to what amounts to a cash cow for the investor class. This has not been done democratically, as example after example shows. Mainly, it's done  through financial exploitation of national disaster, both man-made and natural, and given an intellectual patina by Chicago's school of  free-market economics.  Chief enablers include the IMF and World Bank, whose \\"therapeutic\\" policies typically promote foreign interests at the expense of local populations. The result is a greatly expanded private sector and a vastly shrunken public one in those vital service areas locals depend upon. The lack of popular support must then be overridden by some version of \\"shock and awe\\", such as war, depression, or cataclysm. The upshot amounts to a global counter-revolution to decades of liberal reform aimed at making capitalism livable. Tellingly, readers can learn more about the dynamics of that reform period from Klein's pages 250 - 253 than from high-school texts or even many political science courses. I know I did.
B000K15VSA|5.0|25 years after the theatrical release of Ridley Scott's science fiction masterpiece Blade Runner, the film still retains every bit of its visual brilliance (made even more gorgeous with digitally remastered picture), but it's crystal clear that more than just the imagery makes Scott's 3rd film one of the most important and entertaining films of its genre.<br /><br />In futuristic Los Angeles, androids designed to be nearly indistinguishable from humans are banned from Earth after mutinous actions off-world. These Replicants that attempt to return are to be hunted down and \\"retired\\" by special police units known as Blade Runners. When one such enforcer, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is assigned to eliminate a group of extremely dangerous Nexus 6 Series Replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), he begins to acknowledge the thin line that defines humanity. In his eventual confrontation with Batty, and through encounters with an unknowing Replicant named Rachel (Sean Young), Deckard will learn what it means to be human.<br /><br />The steady build of each main character is truly flawless and the deliberate pacing allows for more powerful revelations into the intricacies of humanity. Harrison Ford perfectly captures the initially remorseless Blade Runner Rick Deckard, who terminates Replicants for a living and appears indifferent towards their existence - that is until he encounters Rachel. Slowly falling for the beautiful creation, who doesn't even realize what she is, Deckard begins to question what it means to be human (and many believe Deckard to be a Replicant himself, generating even more philosophical questions).<br /><br />Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty embodies the perfect antagonist to Deckard's antihero, a violent and ruthless killer who wants what he cannot have - an extension on life itself. A sporting terminator of sorts, Batty possesses many attributes that Deckard does not (and vice versa), and the two parallel and supplement the essence of each other's existence. Batty starts with a clear purpose and mission, yet ends meeting the inevitable fate so cruelly inherent to his kind. Deckard has a less focused existence and is forced into his unwanted assignment; he only begins to value life when he falls in love with Rachel and acquires a new purpose. He gains life and love as Batty loses both. Batty's poetic final words echo a loss of life, not the simple \\"retiring\\" of an android, and Gaff's portent closing admonition accords with Deckard's desire to cherish what time he has left with Rachel.<br /><br />The set designs and look of the film is nothing short of cinematically inspired. Turbid steam flows freely from every mechanical object hovering, gliding and scampering about; murky water plummets from the sky, drips from ceilings and skates across the trash-ridden streets of a futuristic Los Angeles. Styled to look like Tokyo if it had succumb to gross overpopulation, pollution and a totalitarian government, the streets of 2019 L.A. are covered in highly stylized denizens not that far removed from the cantina of Mos Eisley. A feeling of dread, alienation and claustrophobia lingers about every blackened, sordid street, and the various smattering of languages creates a further isolation from the comforts of familiar humanity.<br /><br />Enormous, uninviting skyscrapers tower above the dusky horizon, and blinking spaceships scurry around the bustling airways. Every bit of scenery is blanketed with smog, shadows and smoke, and shimmering neons and electric billboards peek through the dismal vapors. The atmosphere of Blade Runner is wholly unique, and it adds to the striking seriousness of every event, no matter how outlandish or (science) fictional, and gives it the distinct tone of uncertainty, dehumanization and fear surrounding mortality. Pulsing electronic rhythms by Vangelis permeate the grim events and narrate the moody film noir elements that frequent this seminal science fiction epic.<br /><br />Some say 2001: A SpaceOdyssey is the finest example of science fiction ever to grace the big screen, but we say Blade Runner. With suspenseful action, perfect acting, unbeatable character development and designs, beautifully foreboding sets, poetic dialogue, poignant themes, gripping violence, flawless storytelling and a love story to boot, Ridley Scott's broodingly dark foray into serious science fiction is the uncontested champion.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinson ever to grace the big screen, but we say Blade Runner.

B00001U0DP|4.0|Life is Beautiful is almost two distinctive productions - the first an almost slapstick comedy with absurdities and pratfalls, the second a comi-tragedy in which the protagonists are interred in a concentration camp during World War II.    The scenes and settings throughout the film are glorious.  The tension of the concentration camp setting, for both prisoners and their overseers, was palpable.    As an American viewer I was uncomfortable with the last half of the film.  It was during that portion that the lead character made light of the many awful things occurring inside the concentration camp all for the benefit and fortification of his young son.  A couple of the monologues were revealing, however.  Who would accept the absurdity of human beings being burnt in ovens and their remains being reconstituted into buttons and soap?  Of course that can't be true.    One of the main things that this film brought to me was the fact that the comedian...the one always trying to make the situation better and lighter...was the ultimate hero.  American filmmakers should learn a lesson from that.    This review refers to the English-dubbed version of the film.
0143038583|5.0|This is a book that educates, is well written and will scare the hell out of you all at the same time. I was not surprised to see over 300 reviews for this book. I now feel wiser about today's modern foods and do not believe that our country will look out for our nutrition. Because of this book I have already eliminated corn syrup from my diet! It was eye-opening to find it on labels of everything in the grocery today. Next they will be slathering it on apples,etc. if the big food companies can get away with it! I am also trying to avoid buying food from many of the big food companies who have no souls like General Mills,etc. They want one thing only money--it matters not to them what our children are ingesting as long as they make money. $5 boxes of cereal laden with cheap corn syrup is unhealthy for our children and is a money making windfall for cereal companies. Every mother should read this book and every high school student should also. We need an overhaul of the food industry-- and let's get rid of MacDonalds first!
B000VWYJ86|2.0|Just like the others in this series, this is totally not like the book. In and of itself it is sort of ok, but still the book series is still better. I would have preferred that the movies stuck to the stories in the books.
B000RO9PXC|3.0|I was kind of wary of this one because of all of the feedback on Morrison being so wasted that his performance suffers, but those comments are  exaggerated. He does slur a bit from time to time, but it's doesn't deter from the songs. Far from it, a lot of the songs are uniquely rowdy and energetic. Of the three discs presented here, only the third is dispensible.    If you have enjoyed prior Bright Midnight Archives releases, I think you'll like this. Really beautiful packaging and liner notes as well. If you are new to The Doors live material, I'd suggest picking up [[ASIN:B000002H92 In Concert]], Live in Boston is for the fan who wants to hear everything.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I love this movie, I can watch it over and over again.  I saw it several times in the theater and I'm excited to have the DVD.  Great story, well acted, fabulous music.  I don't understand why it wasn't a bigger hit in the theaters.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Action packed movie with quite a few deviations from the books. You will not go bored. I would give it 3.5 stars
B000VBJEEG|1.0|This movie is a great movie - I've always loved Pixar's productions, however, you might want to be careful, because Disney has placed the ARccOS copyright protection scheme on this DVD.  To me, this shouldn't even be called a DVD, because the ARccOS DVD protection inserts \\"bad sectors\\" all over the DVD,  This means that some DVD players, including mine, freeze up periodically during loading, playing, etc, and cause headaches trying to view the movie.  Be really careful about this DVD, as Disney claims that there 'isn't anything wrong' and that I should just 'fast forward through the parts that are not compatible with my DVD player'.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|This set has everything most people will ever want or need. The definitive version of the film, a comprehensive documentary, and all the other versions of the film for comparison (except the workprint, which quite frankly, your average non-obsessed fan will not care much about). Plus deleted and alternate scenes, featurettes on Phillip K. Dick, trailers, and lots of other goodies to keep you entertained for hours.    Just as an aside: I saw the theatrical version with narration for the first time with this set. I alternated between grimacing and laughing at Ford's narration. And the ending was atrocious considering what had gone before. Maybe it's because the Director's Cut was the way I first saw the film, but this version didn't work for me at all.    Nope, I think the Final Cut is the best yet. Cleaned up, \\"fixed\\" digitally, and just the right tone. But if you're a fan of the original, it's here, too. That's the great thing about this set: something for almost everyone. Totally obsessed fans should get the five-disc version for the workprint, but if you want to save money, go for this one.
B00068TJM6|5.0|Well this one has it all.  I just need new glasses to read it.  Some numbers are so small you need a magnifying glass to read them.   But, half the reason for buying this was it's looks - which are great!   Merry Christmas to numero uno!
B000NA28A2|5.0|Great CD!. Juan Luis Guerra does it again. Great songs and beautiful melodies. A fun listen!
B000K15VSA|5.0|After having watched The Director's Cut year after year in anticipation of The Final Cut, I can tell you this much:<br /><br />The Final Cut transfer is gorgeous.  And I'm not normally the kind of person who notices such things.<br /><br />And if you're a Film Geek (the kind of person who watches films with the commentary track activated), you'll be very impressed with the feature-length documentary and other superior featurettes.<br /><br />Like a New Line Platinum Series DVD, or something from the Criterion Collection.<br /><br />'Cept different.
B000I0QK74|5.0|If you love James Taylor, this is the Christmas album to have. His rendition of Jingle Bells is so cool - much better than the original !
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is a beautifully presented DVD of the outstanding series.  The additions and print material all add to a captivating program.  If you enjoyed the series this is a must collection.  Having the complete set allows you to follow clearly the interconnected plots from one episode to the other.  The fast paced diologue, coupled with the excellent camara work is truly amazing.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I have a \\"from the beginning,\\" perspective of RENT.  In 1995, I moved to New York, because one of my oldest and dearest friends asked me to.  She was there, living in other people's apartments, and wanted a place of her own.  We had lived together in Michigan and had known eachother since about 15 years old.  Once we settled into a studio in Brooklyn, she decided that she didn't want to be in the office of the New York Theatre Workshop, but wanted to Stage Manage Theatre.  Mind you, we were both in our early 20s.  Upon her resignation, she was offered assistant stage manager for a new musical at the workshop:  Rent.  Night after night she would come home and talk about Jonathan, Anthony, et. all.  \\"Light My Candle,\\" was a song that she often had in her head during rehearsals.  At the time, we had NO IDEA that a phenom was in the making.  As opening night at the NYTW approached, she offered me comps.  No great thrill.  I'd seen some other workshop theatre and was disappointed.  Then Jonathan died.  She came home that night in shock.  The next day was to be the first performance in front of an audience.  It was transformed into a memorial at the theater.  At this point, things drastically started to change.  The memorial turned into a 'performance' half-way through, and she described the experience as a life-altering experience.  Again, still not much hype about the actual show.  Moving on, I took a friend to opening night at the NYTW.  It was packed.  The theatre was shockingly small.  Maybe 300-400 seats.  My guest and I ended up in the aisle, sitting on the steps, about 10 feet from the stage.  The big deal that night was that 80s teen queen Molly Ringwald was in the audience, as a close friend of Larson's.  Well, the show was like NO experience I'd ever encountered.  At intermission, my companion and I smoked outside the theatre in wonder of the talent on stage, the brilliance of the composer and the fact that we were lucky to be counted among the few who would experince this masterpiece.    After the show, we were invited to the cast party.  I'd been to many cast parties in my life and my companion, Jackie and I almost didn't go.  We were young and New York had better things to offer.  However, we agreed.  Next thing I know, I'm at a buffet table, standing next to Molly Ringwald. A few moments later, while eating Swedish Meatballs, one of the actors, as wide eyed as me, grabbed me by the shoulders (not knowing me), and said, \\"I'm at a party with MOLLY RINGWALD!!!!).  At the time, I was as excited as he was.  Looking back, I think, \\"my God!  Wilson Jermaine Herdia, future Tony winner and film actor, was as star-struck as I was.  Within days, the publicity was overwhelming.  Before I knew it, my roommate mentioned the B word.  Broadway.  Holy S#*t!!!  There was a LOT of red tape in the transmission.  One of the cool aspects was that the cast was really tight.  They wanted absolute equal pay.  They even came together to champion my roommate...just an assistant manager, but a human being that they had grown close to.  She (my roommate) wasn't AT ALL in any unions and was very young.  Eventually, things were ironed out, and my best friend was going to broadway!  (Imagine that from a gal from Michigan living in a studio apartment in Brooklyn with another person, at that young age!)  Between closing night off-broadway and opening night on Broadway, a lot of work was to be done, all without the creator's input.  I remember Cathie taking me to the new Broadway home for RENT at the Niederlander Theatre.  This theater had not been utilized for YEARS.  The day I was there, construction was being done to the stage, the \\"house,\\" and the lobby.  It was a mess.  We both agreed that a show like RENT deserved to be in such a run-down, shabby theater.  Hype was escalating.  I was getting caught up in it.  Had the actual show not moved and touched me as it did, things might have been different, but i was excited.  It was surreal.  At this point, the hype was really taking off.  Again, I was wrapped up in my own world.  How does one know at the time that you are experiencing History first hand?  Cathie brought home a video tape of the show at the NYTW. She needed to study it for the broadway rehearsals.  At this point, I was in love with the show.  I made an audio tape of the performance.  The audio was recorded through the soundboard, so audience responce was minimal.  I listened to that tape almost every day until the official cast recording was released.  I still have it.  There was even a song that was cut.    Now to the film.  The show moved me beyond any other experience.  I saw it countless times on Broadway.  I am not one of those 'rent-heads' that would stand in line for tickets, so I don't necessarily consider myself the biggest fan of the show.  But I know it well.   The film moved me again, as it did off and on Broadway.  I was thrilled to see most of the cast on screen, as I felt their performances were beyond compare.  The emotion and feel of the film was outstanding.    What I didn't like was the shift of time to the late 80s.  This show IS the 1990s.  Roger's hair was repulsive.  Nothing like the punk/pop spikes he had in the original.  And how can a movie taking place in the 80s mention THELMA AND LOUISE?!?!?  Finally, I hated the opening sequence of Anthony Rapp singing while riding a bike through the 'streets of New York.\\"  And how could the filmmaker turn \\"Take Me or Leave Me,\\" into a song at their wedding?!?!  Anyway, view this one with an open heart and you will surly  be moved by the power of the music, story and performances.  It deserved a better chance in movie theaters.
B000PKG7I4|4.0|This was a gift for my father, who will turn 70 next year.  Both my mom and dad love various music and are always open to new things.  This year they even hit an Alice Cooper concert!  When my brother and his partner introduced Amy Winehouse to my dad- he loved her. He called to suggest he might get this CD from 'Santa'.  Keep rockin dad!!!!
B000YKG5L4|4.0|Apologize is a great song but listening to it repeatedly can depress the hell out of you as you recall all of your failed relationships. There are a few other good songs on this album and the vocals are pretty good. Mercy is also a good song.

B000AGTPUK|5.0|Love the DVD.  Got it just in time to watch it a dozen times with my grandson before Christmas!! It is his FAVORITE movie....THANKS!  Happy New Years!  Lesli<><
B000002UDB|5.0|While the movie, \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" was a huge flop (nothing happened!), the appurtenant music is simply brilliant. I like every cut on this album.<br /><br />Most fans gravitate either to \\"Sgt Pepper,\\" \\"Revolver,\\" \\"The Beatles\\" (The White Album), or even to \\"Rubber Soul\\" as their top pick but \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" (1967) really hit a grand slam with me. I bought a copy when it first hit the music stores and I've played it frequently ever since. Along with \\"Revolver\\" (1966), the music represents the outset of The Beatles' psychedelic \\"middle period\\". And it's probably significant that \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" came out just after the greatest Summer in the history of all mankind, 1967... \\"The Summer of Love\\". The rock music composed and played during this historically significant window of time generated huge enduring impacts upon American society.<br /><br />\\"I Am the Walrus\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" my two favorite cuts, were incredibly innovative compositions which nothing of the like had been done before, and very little since. \\"I Am the Walrus\\" was a clear slam at \\"The Man\\" from the drug counterculture element's paradigm. The lyrics appear to have been conceived by a madman and I'm sure that many of these unique phrases exuded from an actual LSD experience. A new word was even invented and conveyed in this song: SNIED. LyricsFreak.com has it thus:<br /><br />I AM THE WALRUS<br />by The Beatles<br /><br />I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.<br />See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly.<br />I'm crying.<br /><br />Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come.<br />Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody tuesday.<br />Man, you been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long.<br />I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.<br />I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob.<br /><br />Mister city policeman sitting<br />Pretty little policemen in a row.<br />See how they fly like lucy in the sky, see how they run.<br />I'm crying, i'm crying.<br />I'm crying, i'm crying.<br /><br />Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye.<br />Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess,<br />Boy, you been a naughty girl you let your knickers down.<br />I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.<br />I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob.<br /><br />Sitting in an english garden waiting for the sun.<br />If the sun don't come, you get a tan<br />From standing in the english rain.<br />I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.<br />I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob.<br /><br />Expert textpert choking smokers,<br />Don't you thing the joker laughs at you?<br />See how they smile like pigs in a sty,<br />See how they snied.<br />I'm crying.<br /><br />Semolina pilchard, climbing up the eiffel tower.<br />Elementary penguin singing hari krishna.<br />Man, you should have seen them kicking edgar allan poe.<br />I am the eggman, they are the eggmen.<br />I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob.<br />Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob g'goo.<br /><br />With that, I'll bow out!g's eye.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|The Photraphy is fantastic It tells a story that is worth telling in such a way that it is easy to under stand.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|The seller packed this DVD well and shipped it quickly.  What more could you ask?
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I began listening to Dream Theater in 1992 with Images and Words. I became a life long fan ever since. when i hear I&W, it brings back cool memories of a time without kids,a mortgage,and a crappy job. Systematic Chaos came out last summer and i got to share it with my sons. My 9 year old knows all the words. I took him to their Chicago show last august.    This album rules.
B00027JYLC|5.0|I really liked this movie. I was very taken w/ the movie and the charecters. Many of them were really circus people. When you watch the movie and listen to the stories of the people after the movie it makes you see them in a new light.
B000002UAU|5.0|It's just my opinion but this album might just be the greatest assemblage of The  Beatles' work ever produced. Sgt. Pepper represents their middle period of counterculture Classic Rock music and may well be the top rock album of the entire 20th Century, (and of the 21st, so far!).<br /><br />My favorite cut is \\"With a Little Help from My Friends,\\" a very melodic and period typical love-one-another tune. I was similarly bowled over by Joe Cocker's (slower) version of this composition which he sang live at Woodstock.<br /><br />Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, who was so impressed with Sgt. Pepper, tried with a Herculean effort to generate an album of this magnitude when, in response, he produced \\"Pet Sounds\\". It was good, but didn't come close to manifesting the brilliance of this Beatles masterpiece. (EDIT! Well, it turns out that this paragraph is erroneous! See \\"comments\\" on this review where someone much shrewder than I got it right -- still it SOUNDS good *.* )<br /><br />Paul McCartney plays a very busy Hoffner bass guitar on this one and his innovative rhythms sort of set the pace for the entire work. The harmonies are as spectacular here as they are on any Beatles album that exists.<br /><br />This album/CD virtually screams out THE BEATLES!!! and I cannot think of a better Classic Rock investment which one could make.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|The atmosphere is immersive and the many questions arise between what happens when people and their machines become indistinguishable. Ford plays a detective hunting the skin-jobs as he falls for a beautiful femme fatale he's been instructed to retire. A man/machine searches for his humanity. The mind blowing visionary scenes of a dystopic future are still breathtaking
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Blade Runner is a dark futuristic sci-fi thriller that will have you sitting open-jawed at the edge of your seat from the start to the finish.  The sets and costumes are magnificently stylish and definitely add to the film noir feeling.  This is a move that, once seen, you will never forget.  Twenty years from now you will close your eyes and scenes will still flash through your head.  It definitely makes an impression.
B000O1799U|1.0|What planet am I on.....isn't this earth? I have to check because I recently saw a terribly boring and vastly overrated movie called Dreamgirls. You would think from all the hype this movie got it would have been the best musical since the Wizard Of Oz! Instead what I saw was another example of a bunch of snob critics trying to sell me a chocolate covered lemon. I won't criticise each aspect because there isn't anymore time left to spend on this waste of a good two hours of time. Jennifer Hudson.....an Oscar.....for this.....FOGGEDDABBOUDDIT. And just when you thought Grease 2 was as bad as it gets. This is worse!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This movie will be awesome of the two that will be released so far. This show should have never been canclled and when we buy this movie and the next all of us will use our support to have MGM sign for more Stargate SG-1 movies.
B000002UAX|5.0|There are already nearly 1,000 reviews of this fine, double CD Classic Rock work so I'll just make a few comments which will hopefully be informative.<br /><br />This is arguably the best Classic Rock album of the 20th Century... it's certainly in the top 10 and no rock music enthusiast should be without a copy. The 60s counterculture compositions/renditions manifested herein are representative of the culmination of The Beatles' (psychedelic) \\"middle period\\". I know of no rock music which was ever more innovative than that which is found within the songs on this CD. I suppose, at this point, I've owned a half-dozen copies over the years in every format of available media.<br /><br />My favorite song on the album has always been \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" which I finally learned to play correctly on acoustic guitar about 5 years ago. It's really a simple set of lyrics, prose with no particularly deep meaning -- just a fun little song.<br /><br />It's true that Paul, George, and Ringo tried desperately to keep Yoko Ono's dubious \\"contribution,\\"  the sound collage of \\"Revolution No. 9,\\" (the credit reads \\"Lennon/McCartney\\" which probably irks Paul to no end), off the album but John ultimately prevailed on that one -- it quickly became the most controversial cut on the album and remains so today. From my view, that singular recording, musically speaking, manifests 8+ minutes of worthless trash -- as a curiosity which launched similar ideas on other rock albums, it's difficult to estimate its considerable impact. All other songs on the CD (melodically) are just great, brilliant actually.<br /><br />This CD set does include a nice insert which contains all song lyrics, individual color bust photos of the Fab Four, and, a few collages of The Beatles, shot mostly in the studio as they developed this album but you'll need a magnifying glass to view the latter.<br /><br />And finally, enthusiastic Beatles fans should be made aware that significant differences exist between the mono and stereo versions of the original vinyl albums, including differences in vocals, instrumentation, sound effects, etc.<br /><br />So, there you have my two-cents' worth!nyl albums, including differences in vocals, instrumentation, sound effects, etc.    So, there you have my two-cents' worth!
B000U618C8|5.0|This was given as a gift as the person requested it.  I know nothing about this group.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|To finish the thought of the title of the review, who would have thought that a movie about a rat would be so great?  Apparently the great minds at Pixar/Disney that's who!<br />This is a beautiful film.  Hands down one of the most impressive examples of video quality you can find.  Reference quality.  Demo quality.  (As in used to demonstrate high-def equipment to help sell it to customers in big box stores, appliance and electronic areas in department stores, etc.)<br />The color pops, the graphics are so stunning and impressive that words escape me for adequately praising the movie and the results obtained in watching this disc.  Just absolutely great work by Pixar/Disney on the Blu-ray version of this film.<br />The movie itself is unbelievably good also.  I'm not a fan of Patton Oswalt.  I find his voice to be grating and irritating to me, and yet he fits the role he plays here perfectly and doesn't irritate at all.  While I originally assumed that I'd find the thought of a rat chef disgusting, the story is great and so entertaining that you go past all of that in mere seconds of watching the movie.<br />Add this great movie to your collection now.  Don't hestitate!
B000VNMMQG|3.0|The movie was beautifully done, but not what I expected and I felt it was overrated.
B000WZAE1I|1.0|Geez, this movie stank on ice. And that's really saying something, considering I'm a huge fan of fantasy. I love \\"Lord of the Rings\\", I love unicorns and dragons and magical amulets, I love adventure and romance and humor -- but \\"Stardust\\" failed to meet my expectations, in any of those categories.     This movie was so stupid, so downright lame, it nearly made me gag. I was barely fifteen minutes into the movie before I suddenly felt the urge to get up and do something else. Even the unicorn hardly made up for the rest of the movie. (The unicorn was there for, like, three minutes; and then it was gone, just like that.)     No offense to the actors -- I like Robert DeNiro, and I like Michelle Pfeiffer, and all those other guys, but I liked them much better in other movies.
B000VR824S|5.0|My hubby so much enjoyed this Christmas Gift.. thank you ever so much for your speedy service and quality product
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I have always loved this story and starring actors Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds only add to the loveliness of the tale. Highly recommended.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I was very satisfied with the condition the DVD arrived in and I already knew the movie itself was amazing, having seen it in the theaters.  The price was unbeatable and the DVD made a great Christmas gift.
B000YENUI6|2.0|Alright, I originally saw the previews for this movie while watching another movie in the theater.... \\"Eastern Promises\\" plot/storyline sounded intriguing to say the least.     I recently saw this movie on dvd rental and it was awful!! It is slow, incredibly, heart-wrenchingly slooooow to watch!! Several times I wanted to stop this movie and just return it. I kept watching \\"Eastern Promises\\"  as I figured it must have a good ending but it didn't. There were lots of loose ends that weren't adequately answered at the end of the movie. Lots of themes/topics were superficially touched upon, but never quite explored in the kind of detail that could have made this a movie an all around great one.    Naomi Watts & Viggo Mortensen were the only shining stars in this movie as their acting was the best part of the entire film.
6304698682|5.0|I've been a fan of Clint Eastwood's Westerns for such a long time. I saw this movie only very recently and enjoyed it. Don't miss it!!!
B000R6PKP2|5.0|Well we've waited a long time for this set and it's been worth it. The packaging is excellent, the included items (especially the perspex film clip) superb and the the contents of the discs amazing. I've just watched the 'Dangerous Days' documentary and it's a delight. I couldn't ask for more. This is exceptionally good value for money and beyond my wildest expectations in terms of content and quality. Oh, and it is region free for those like me who that matters to.
0446577391|5.0|Baldacci is becoming one of my favorite authors and this entry in his Camel Club series helps to confirm why. His ideas are fresh and move the novel along. Characters are well drawn and in each book one learns a little more about the past of John Carr.  In all a satisfying read.
0765318741|4.0|Decided to read this book after watching the trailer for the movie.  I couldn't put the book down.  The power of this book is that the main character development is fantastic and then the author completely shocks you with a plot change.  Just when you think you know what's going on, the author surprises you.  Loved the book. Just wished it was longer.
B000NA77YO|4.0|This isn't the place to debate the whole \\"who is the better singer\\" issue.  If you prefer Dio or want a good cross-section sampler, getting this one is money well spent. Could it have been better?  The original press with Tony and Ronnie hinted at a box set so the single-disc compliation-- however complete-- does feel like a bit of a cheat, particularly because both this disc and the \\"Heaven and Hell\\" tour did brisk business.  A box set or at least two discs certainly would have sold well.  Nothing on here really merits dropping, but \\"Sign of the Southern Cross,\\" \\"Computer God\\" and the \\"E5150\\" intro to \\"The Mob Rules\\" are serious omissions, and only a single song from \\"Live Evil\\" is a shortfall.<br /><br />Make no mistake, a superb product with great sound, I just wish there were more to it.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a great 2 part CD.  I and many of my friends love the English period movies and this Jane Austin is wonderful.  I had a great time comparing it to the newer movie with Kiera Knightley.
1594489505|5.0|I just finished the book at 1:30am on the third day after picking it up. I don't often do that, but this was one of those books that would not let me put it down. I enjoyed it so much, I am afraid to pick up another book during this Christmas break for fear that it will not give me the same joy as this one.  This book has put my own life into perspective. I recommned it even for those of us who can only read during our vacations!
1401300529|3.0|I ordered and read this book as a suggested title by Amazon. This is not a meticulously researched historical description of battle like Rick Atkinson's first two volumes of his WWII trilogy of American forces in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and France. It is not an engrossing first person history of battle like \\"Band of Brothers\\" by Ambrose or \\"We were soldiers once . . . and young\\" by Moore. And it is certainly not historical fiction with the entertainment value of the collected works of the Shaara's. Halberstam did not have the luxury of the passage of time to observe the geopolitics like Groome did in \\"A storm in Flanders\\", describing the disaster of WWI that set the stage for WWII, and his post hoc reflections on Vietnam as it relates to Korea are pure opinion and poorly backed up by facts.  I, like other reviewers, would have liked to see more discussion of the battles, something about the advent of the Air Force, high speed dogfighting (isn't the history of the Lafeyette Escadrille wonderful in Jeff Shaara's \\"To the Last Man\\"?), and other battles commented here by those who were there.  Finally, I can not reconcile David Halberstam's opinions about \\"Who Lost China\\", with the facts meticulously documented by Evans in \\"Blacklisted by History\\". Roosevelt, Truman, Marshall, Acheson and the Democrats won WWII, stablized Germany and Japan, and totally set the stage for 50 years of cold war by not realizing the true threat of Communism, Stalinism, Maoism, and the dark world of the Gulag. Not unlike the naive Wilson setting the stage for WWII with the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations. It is such a shame that Halberstam is no longer with us, a debate between Stanton Evans and he would be fascinating.
B000OVLBEO|4.0|I personally feel that the numerous superhero films that have been popping up since &#34;X-Men&#34; came out in 2000 are all of about the same quality. Yeah, everyone has their personal favorites (mine are 2009's &#34;Watchmen&#34; and 2003's &#34;Daredevil: The Director's Cut&#34;) but, generally speaking, they're all decent cinematic versions of the comic heroes.<br /><br />Mark Steven Johnson's &#34;Ghost Rider&#34; (2007) combines Faust and Spider-Man and mixes in elements of all the variations of the Ghost Rider comics up to the present, including the 50's Western hero, but it's main inspiration is the 70s-80s comic featuring Johnny Blaze as the protagonist.<br /><br />What makes Ghost Rider appealing? Well, the only thing cooler than a guy in black leather and chains driving a Harley is a flaming skeleton in black leather and chains driving a supernatural flaming Harley. That pretty much explains it.<br /><br />THE PLOT: Johnny Blaze and his father make a living as Evel Knieval-like stunt riders in a carnival. When Johnny's dad is diagnosed with cancer he is misled into making a deal with the devil. His father is healed of the cancer but Satan makes sure he dies in a stunt accident. Because of Johnny's foolish deal he is cursed to become the nigh-invincible Ghost Rider -- a supernatural flaming skeleton.<br /><br />Some criticize Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze because Blaze is supposed to be about 30 years old, while Cage was around 41. Yeah, someone like James Franco would have been better for the role, especially since Franco looks exactly like Mike Ploog's version of Blaze, but Cage does a fine job. Besides, Cage is in great shape and I know guys 25 years old who look older than him. As for Eva Mendes, who plays Johnny's girlfriend, she's ten years younger than Cage and is both voluptuous and adequate in the role.<br /><br />Some criticize the film as too serious, others as too goofy, but the fact is that &#34;Ghost Rider&#34; has the same general tone as all the other superhero flicks released since 2000. It's a serious story for the most part, although completely unbelievable due to the subject matter, with some humor thrown in for good measure. In other words, it's neither deathly serious nor a campy goof-fest; it rides the line between these two extremes.<br /><br />If all you want out of &#34;Ghost Rider&#34; is an entertaining supernatural superhero flick &#34;Ghost Rider&#34; delivers and is worth viewing for this purpose. But the film delivers on a deeper level. Here are a smattering of noteworthy elements:<br /><br />- Note that Johnny is misled into &#34;selling his soul&#34; to the devil and has to face the negative consequences of his decision. Few people will literally &#34;sell their soul&#34; to Satan as shown in the story but we can all relate to the struggle with the evil that exists within our own hearts. If we decide to live according to the inclinations of our lower, destructive, selfish nature are we not, in a sense, &#34;selling our soul&#34; to the devil? (regardless of whether you view the devil as a literal spiritual being or merely as a symbol of potential human evil). Whenever we choose to live according to this lower nature will we not automatically perform evil and, in that sense, fulfill the devil's will? (ditto).<br /><br />- Peter Fonda as Satan is perfect and entertaining, as is Sam Elliott as the old Westerner.<br /><br />- Love is an important theme in the story. Johnny &#34;sells his soul&#34; for love of his father. He didn't do it for greed or some other carnal purpose. This is agape love, self-sacrificial love, love in it's highest and purest form. This puts Johnny on God's side (as Elliott's character observes in the film) and makes him a serious threat to the devil's purposes on earth.<br /><br />- We also witness Blaze's great love for Roxanne and vice versa, as well as Mack's love for Johnny, etc.<br /><br />- This is contrasted by the total absence of love in Satan's kingdom.The devil hates his son and vice versa. This is a fitting depiction because God is described as love in the Bible; and since Satan has chosen to separate from God and be His enemy, he has naturally separated himself from love and become love's enemy. Hate in all its ugly manifestations is therefore the essence of the devil's kingdom and relationships.<br /><br />- When Blaze first turns into the Ghost Rider and goes for a ride in his flame cycle he causes great havoc wherever he goes. You'll note that this is much toned down in his later excursions as Ghost Rider. The explanation? Johnny simply didn't know how to control the supernatural hellfire and &#34;spirit of vengeance&#34; during his initial conversion.<br /><br />- Although it's supposed to be amusing, it makes sense that Johnny would listen to The Carpenters in his down time. Blaze's daredevil lifestyle and his problems with the Ghost Rider curse would understandably cause him a great deal of stress. Listening to Karen's ultra-soothing voice would be a great pacifier.<br /><br />- There's a great scene of Ghost Rider riding off the top of a skyscrapper, whipping his chain in exulting fury, and then riding full blast down the building smashing into the pavement below as police and onlookers observe in total disbelief.<br /><br />- In the comics Blackheart was the only comic character that ever sent chills down my spine (in Ann Nocenti's Daredevil). I didn't get this feeling from Wes Bentley's portrayal in the film, although there's a hint of that. Regardless, Bentley does a fine job in the role. And Blackheart's total ugly wickedness is certainly revealed or demonstrated here and there.<br /><br />- There's a great musical interlude featuring the Ghost Rider and the Caretaker (Elliott) riding through the night desert for hundreds of miles to San Vengaza. Fittingly, the song is a modern hard rock version of &#34;Ghost Riders in the Sky&#34; (I love that song! Who doesn't?)<br /><br />- I saw the theatrical version when it first came out on DVD and recently purchased the director's cut, which adds approximately 10 minutes of extra footage for a total of about 2 hours runtime. Unlike &#34;Daredevil,&#34; where the director's cut transformed a mediocre flick into a great one, the extra footage for &#34;Ghost Rider&#34; doesn't make or break the story. In fact, I can't really tell what the extra footage is. It's mostly just extended dialogue, I guess. So, if you don't feel like shelling out the extra cash for the director's cut, you're not missing all that much, if anything the extra footage just slows the film down (but I prefer it).<br /><br />- The picture was filmed in Victoria, Australia, and the city of Melbourne.<br /><br />- The Ghost Rider himself (itself?) is a triumph of special effects. Needless to say, the film is enjoyable just to look at.<br /><br />- On the extra features disk (director's cut only) there's a great 4-part documentary called &#34;Sin and Salvation&#34; on each of the comics incarnations of Ghost Rider up to the present, which runs approximately 45 minutes. It features such comics notables as Roy Thomas, Mike Ploog, J.M. DeMatteis, Howard Mackie and many more.<br /><br />If anything I've mentioned here trips your trigger be sure to check out &#34;Ghost Rider.&#34;<br /><br />GRADE: B+Bible; and since Satan has chosen to separate from God and be His enemy, he has naturally separated himself from love and become love's enemy.

B000XKZQ74|5.0|If you can handle subtitles, this was a fascinating movie.  Well worth the time and effort.  The characters were real and sucked you into their lives.  Better than just about anything I've watched recently.
B000Q6KYOA|5.0|This is a good way to save a few bucks. It's exactly the same as the Cannon Brand, but I think it's about half the price.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is definitely a movie to add to the home movie library.  It it so well done from every aspect...acting, scenery, costumes, and storyline.  It's one of those movies that make you feel good to watch and inspires you to do greater things in your own life.  Definitely an A+.
B000002U82|5.0|I am guessing that just about everyone who is a fan of progressive rock owns this album.  It is truly one of the classics of the genre and really one of the classic rock albums of all time.  I have heard this album so many times over the years, that I rarely pull it out anymore, but every time I do, I am reminded of just what a masterpiece this was and still is.  The album is pretty much flawless from start to finish.  The music, lyrics, it all works in spades and for it's time the sound effects and sonic quality of the album was way ahead of it's time.  \\"Dark Side\\" is an all time classic that has stood the test of time since it's release 35 years ago (has it really been that long?).  A great album by a great band.

0670033693|3.0|a little work.  Although the plot, characters and overall flavor of the book were great, I had trouble following who was saying what.  I had to go back and readdress the paragraph heading to see who was speaking.  Evidently, Craig's editor wanted a clean narrative without all the \\"... the sheriff said.\\" But I got to tell you, it was work for a small brain like mine to keep the narrative flowing as I was reading.  I may read a second book just to see if Craig has modified his writing style.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|I recieved this watch 6 days after I ordered it which was what I thought relatively fast.  It came in a very nice box.  Upon inspection of the watch, it seemed heavy but well made.  The movement was very smooth although not as smooth as more expensive watches.  The face looked very classy with a rather large face (this seems to be the style of late).  For the price of the watch it appears to be a well made and looks like a much more expensive piece.  I have received alot of compliments on it and had three friends order other invicta watches upon seeing mine.  I would definately recommend this watch!
B000024D4R|5.0|\\"Animals\\" is one of those albums that gets fairly mixed reviews from Pink Floyd fans.  Most don't rate it up with the band's best, and it seems to have been a bit of a transitional album for the band.  I have always thought that it was a brilliant piece of work.  The album is probably the hardest rocking of any of Floyd's stuff, and the lyrics rank right up with Roger Waters most cynical.  The album is somewhat based on George Orwell's Animal Farm with humanity divided into Dogs, Pigs, and Sheep.  Anyone who works in the corporate world should be able to relate to \\"Dogs\\" and \\"Sheep\\" is one of the best single compositions the band ever did in my opinion.  \\"Pigs (3 Different Ones)\\", does not work quite as well, but is still solid.  The opening and closing acoustic numbers \\"Pigs On The Wing Part One And Two\\" serve as an intro and coda to the rest of the material.  David Gilmour has some great guitar parts on this disc and Richard Wright's keyboard work is some of his most creative.  Opinions certainly seem to vary on this one, but for me it is another essential album in my Pink Floyd collection.
B000244EMO|5.0|It's one thing that you've got a film with a kick [...] cool as hell alien that hunts humans for sport, and there is nearly no stopping him.  But its the cast of this movie that really pushes the testosteroine into overdrive - with Arnold, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and a list of guys in their athletic prime, all sporting the commando look, armed to the teeth with what seems like unlimited firepower in the jungles of South America.  Even within the first 5 minutes of the film, you've got Arnold and Carl Weathers bulging their biceps while engaging in a very manly handshake - from there on you know this is gonna be one tough manly-muscled film.  And it is, until the Predator hunts them down one by one.<br /><br />In South America, the team is sent to infiltrate a small base and rescue hostages.  Finding their old buddies hanging upside down from a tree and completely skinned leaves the team ready to blow the living daylights off the enemy base, and they do in a spectacular barage of gunfire that can compete with most war movie scenes.  But they eventually learn that it was not men who slautered their old friends, but something else in the jungle, something that's not quite human.<br /><br />One by one, in scenes of suspense, chases, and more gunfire, the units die one by one, until it is just Arnold vs the Predator.  This is where the most excitment of the film lies, as Arnold must use smarts instead of muscle to outwit the Predator.  Yes, even Arnold can't beat him with muscle, as a one on one brawl vs the Predator proves wrong very quickly.<br /><br />In the end, Predator is a very entertaining 90 minutes spent.  You may not even realize there wasn't even a plot to this film, but it's one of those films that doesn't need one.  This is pure adrenaline action and suspense.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 3<br />Overall - 4.5

B00005JPTI|3.0|I Am Legend is a classic story of \\"be careful what you wish for.\\" In the future, a cure for cancer is discovered. Everyone is happy and the creator of the vaccine is hailed as a visionary. Shortly thereafter, it is discovered that the so-called miracle cure actually mutates and causes those who have been vaccinated to turn into rabid, zombie-like creatures who lose their hair, have bloody eyes, and exhibit aggression toward other human beings. When these beings get hungry, they attack human beings until, in the year 2013, there are none left. Or so scientist Robert Neville believes. Alone on the island of Manhattan, but for his dog Sam, Robert attempts to find a cure for the disease and to keep himself from falling victim to the zombies created by the KV vaccine.<br /><br />I Am Legend is startingly like 28 Days Later, and as other reviewers have mentioned, I think that movie did a better job. I did, however, find this movie entertaining, and that's what's important. It's not great. It won't change your life. But it will entertain you, and that's about all I can ask for. If you want a better movie, with a similar theme, try Children on Men with Clive Owen and Julianne Moore. That movie did a much better job of portraying dystopia and the demise of the world.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|English rockers Queen have just re-released their first proper concert film We Will Rock You with a new title Queen Rock Montreal.<br />This DVD (and the off-shoot live album) was recorded and filmed at The Montreal Forum in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on November 24 and 25, 1981 (approximately ten years before the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury).<br />The concert was directed by the late Saul Swimmer and was either Queen's seventh ot eighth attempt of filming a concert (Rainbow 1974, Hammersmith 1975, Hyde Park 1976, Earls Court 1977, Houston Summit 1977, Hammersmith 1979 were all filmed but either technical glitches or whatever caused these shows not to be released).<br />Audio producers Justin Shirley-Smith and Kris Fredriksson returned to the original 24 track analog tapes recorded and originally mixed by 80s Queen co-producer Mack with The Record Plant Mobile Truck and created brand new regular stereo (for the CD and one of the two DVD mixes)) and DTS 5.1 surround sound mixes (found on the DVD). Also, guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor record a commentary track for this DVD and it is great to hear their takes on these preformances.<br />We kick off as the band hits the stage with the entrance music of \\"Intro\\" which sets the tone for the show. We then start off with a killer version of \\"We Will Rock You (fast version)\\" which is stunning. Next is \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" which trumps either the Jazz version or Live Killers versions. We then slow things down with the ballad \\"Play the Game\\" which is stunning. Next is possibly the best version of \\"Somebody to Love I ever heard, only the versions from Earls Court 1977 and Houston Summit 1977 give it a run for the money. Next is a short but simple version of \\"Killer Queen\\" which is superb before we segue into drummer Roger Taylor's classic \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\" which was just superb. Next, John Deacon's classic bass riff begins \\"Get Down Make Love\\" which is the best live version of the three now available. We then slow down again as guitarist Brian May sits at the piano for the ballad \\"Save Me\\" (which Freddie would take over for the middle of song as Brian switched to his regular Red Special guitar. Next is \\"Now I'm Here\\" which is excellent and features the famous Freddie Mercury/audience vocal duel before segueing into \\"Dragon Attack\\" which rocks and then stops cold and Freddie goes back to a reprise of Now I'm Here. The first disc ends with a nice version of Love of My Life with Freddie singing his heart out and the whole song because \\"Love of My Life\\" was not a hit in either the US or Canada so the song would be dropped from the band's 1982 US/Canadian tour.<br />Next is \\"Under Pressure\\" and was the only time it was played by Queen as a four piece (the track was then a new song on the US/Canadian issues of Queen's Greatest Hits album released a few weeks before) and a great version (even without keyboards which the band added a keyboard player for the rest of their touring career). Next is \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" which has a nice impromptu jam before the track which is a spirited version. Next is Roger's Drum and Tympani Solo which shows why Roger Taylor is one of rock's best drummers. then we segue into Brian's Guitar Solo which is amazing and Brian finishes with some help from Roger's drumming. Next is a superb version of \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\". Then we have Queen's almost speed metal take of Elvis Presley's classic \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" which is superb (this was actually performed before the final encore). Next is an excellent take on \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" which shows the band playing with a fire they hadn't had in awhile. We then rock out with the set closing \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" which rocks. The first encore of \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" is a killer version. Next is \\"Sheer Heart Attack' and is the best version of the track ever. We then have the final encore of the traditional \\"We Will Rock You\\" with audience participating and a stellar version of \\"WeAre the Champions\\". We then have the band say farewell as God Save the Queen plays over the PA.<br />This 2-DVD had extras including a 1982 interview on US TV plus their classic 1985 appearance at Live Aid (and for those Queen fans who refused to buy the Live Aid DVD just for Queen now have the chance to acquire this just for Queen's set plus you get rehearsals and behind the scenes footage as well).<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ons\\".

B000K15VSA|3.0|Well I was disappointed with the quality of the case it comes in, I thought it was metal but plastic is OK.  The main problem with this is uness you have small child like hands and fingers you will never carry this by the handle, the handle is just to small (although I dont know where you will be taking it much).  The plastic cover that comes over the cast it self was kinda bent at the corners due to the shrink wrap that was over that.  I just dont like it when there is a plastic sleeve over cases, they just get messed up some how.    Whats inside the box is cool, the art work is great and the hologram thingie as well.  But the unicorn and car are cheep looking, the unicorn is plastic that was been chromed up and you can tell the edge is still there from when it was molded not really smoothed out.  The car has doors that open which is cool but only the back wheels move, and I can see visible glue on the windows on the bottom of the car.  There is a clear plastic insert with a message from Ridley Scott which is nice to see    That being said the quality of the Movie itself was above par for most all HD DVD's out that were transfered from film that was oldish    For the most part the price is great for what you get (there is also just the 5 discs for something like $30 USD or something like that) but I would have paid 2 times this for a metal case with a handle you can use and a die cast unicorn and car    but for the fans out there this is a must buy weather this one or the 5 disc stand alone one, but apparently there are only 103000 of these made since there is a sticker on the bottom of mine (that is not on straight as well) that says \\"Limited Edition 076209/103000\\" so I guess thats how many there are.  I went to my local Best Buy and they are already sold out and it is labeled as \\"discontinued\\" in the computer even though it came out less than a month ago    so yes get this movie for sure, at least the 5 disc stand alone one if this is not around anymore
B000MR9D5E|3.0|I ordered these (3) to give out as Christmas gifts. I actually first saw it on the Oprah show. By the time all was said and done, my purchase came to around $160.00 +.

I haven't watched the videos, and I haven't had any feed back from the people I gave them to.
0060555661|5.0|The Intelligent Investor is a great book when taken in context:  It's a classic text of value investing with a few key ideas that translate well over time despite the passing of the years.  The context is important, as Graham founded his ideas before most of the theories of efficient capital markets were developed, and was heavily influenced by the great depression.    The book draws the distinction between three types of investors:  The conservative investor (should only buy goverment debt, and not a target of the book), the speculative investor (also not a target of the book) and the enterprising, or intelligent investor, whom the book covers.    There were three key takeaways from this book:  1)  The concept of Mr. Market as a manic depressive counterparty.  Sometimes he loves a stock, sometimes he hates it.  As the investor, you can wait for when he comes to you.    2)  The importance of a margin of safety.  Initially this is viewed in terms of assets (a company with more net assets than market cap) though the margin of safety can also be competitive.  (It's worth noting that points 1 & 2 are the key points highlighted by Warren Buffett, Graham's most famous student)    3)  The level of risk someone is willing to take should be dependent on their ability to research and understand their investments.  This runs against the grain of passive portfolio theory, but is indespensible to an individual stock picker.    Despite these points, the book is a product of two times.  The original writings by Graham are filled with many accounting and analytical techniques better suited for a prior era.  The book is more about principles.  Additionally, there's a disproportionate emphasis on Jason Zweig's (very useful) chapter-by-chapter analysis on modern internet duds.    All that said, this book rightfully belongs on every value investor or afficianado's bookshelf, and the updates by Mr. Zweig are a worthwhile addition to bring the book into the modern era.
B000VI6T6K|5.0|Yes it's been issued before, on both LP and CD, and no, there's nothing new on this CD (the accompanying DVD, on the other hand, pulls together a broad array of live footage), but a chestnut's a chestnut, no matter how many times it's released. And re-release with a new marketing angle is how record labels keep the classics selling. If you have an earlier complete edition, you needn't buy this one, but if you're new to Hendrix or never bought \\"Live at Monterey,\\" you'll be glad that Hendrix's conservators have minted fresh copies of this 1967 U.S. debut. In hindsight it's impossible to experience what the Monterey crowd felt on that June day, hearing a fully-formed Hendrix lay down the axioms of hard rock; but even amongst the Hendrix saturated rock landscape of the last forty years, this set still sounds fresh. Hendrix is energized and combines with Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell to ably demonstrate the power of a rock trio. The 43-minute set (including dialog and tuning) features numerous Hendrix classics (\\"Foxey Lady,\\" \\"Hey Joe,\\" \\"The Wind Cries Mary,\\" \\"Purple Haze,\\" \\"Wild Thing\\"), a lengthy cover of Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and raucous versions of Howlin' Wolf's \\"Killing Floor,\\" B.B. King's \\"Rock Me Baby,\\" and the original \\"Can You See Me.\\" The set list was a primer for America, introducing Hendrix to the U.S., and it still makes an excellent introduction to Hendrix's music.

0345472322|1.0|I had read a reference to this book in another, scholarly book, and read the reviews on amazon before ordering it. It came yesterday and last night it went out with the trash, where in my mindset, it belongs. One gets all the insight one needs from the very first sentence of the book in which the author states her students commanded her to write the book. She had to, just had to share her remarkable insights with the world, and make it a better place. I spent an hour trying to salvage any reason for spending more time with it, but to no avail. The book is bloated beyond belief, repetitive, and  written in a style that veers between messianic and Dr. Phil.     So why the positive reviews of the book? The message is positive and reassuring to those who earnestly want to improve their lives and those closest to them. Some people may have believed that such efforts were fruitless because they aren't \\"smart enough.\\" This mindset, as the title indicates, can be our biggest obstacle to improvement. I agree completely.    My complaint with the book is not with its thesis, but with the execution of the ideas, which is simply horrible, and the author's own mindset, that of a blowhard egomaniac, that is to blame. The book should have been reduced to a tight, popular magazine article.

B0000025LS|4.0|This is the first Santana album I got, and it's still pretty damn good.  It's not perfect, but the songs that work are fantastic.  It starts off with one of Santana's best covers, Changes, a song by Cat Stevens.  It has blistering solo by Carlos that really pushes it over the top, and the rhythm section really does well on this one.  E Papa Re is a good song, but some of the others on the first side (Searchin', Over and Over) are kind of lame.  The single, Winning, is very good.  A lot of people thought this song was a sellout, but it isn't.  It's very good, a little different than what Santana has done, but still Santana.  There are 4 great instrumentals here, Tales of Kilimanjaro, I Love You Much Too Much, American Gypsy, and Hannibal (the other 2 are offically called \\"chants\\" in the credits because they have chorus that are \\"chanted\\").  Carlos's solo on Love You Too Much is another really tense one.  The song Brighest Star has a great solo, but it has really bad lyrics (courtesy of the lead singer Alex Ligertwood), and his vocals are not right for the material.  He's not a particularly good blues singer (and on this song he's trying to sound like Joe Cocker).  Some complained at the time that Alex's voice was too commerical, and he was trying to make the band sound like any other band.  That's not really true, but he was an OK lead singer.  Overall, a rather mixed bag, but the songs that work (and Carlos's guitar playing and the rhythm section, lead by Graham Lear, one of Santana's best drummers) really work well.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|After hurting my back doing pre-pregnancy pilates, I bought this DVD. It is a great workout, easy to do, and feels \\"real.\\" The instructor isn't cheesy, the music isn't either, and I really broke a sweat without feeling that I couldn't do it. The best part was that I was sore the next day without being in pain. I plan on doing this at least once a week, along with my other exercises.

B000002518|5.0|Dylan has made many forays into the film world, and honestly, they've been mostly disasters (Renaldo and Clara, Hearts of Fire).  Many musicians attempt to be filmmakers, but for some strange reason, they just can't.  They come across as preachy and pretentious (Renaldo's \\"acted\\" segments are painfully bad).  But this foray, which was Dylan's first entry into the film world (if you don't count documentaries about him), is his best.  His soundtrack to Peckinpah's film is superb, and it really enhances the film greatly.  In fact, a more conventional score wouldn't have worked.  It is an essential component to the film.  It can also be listened to on its own.  The opening theme is one of the most haunting, soulful compositions that Dylan ever wrote.  It invokes a lot of feelings and images on its own.  Billy 1 is the best of the Billy songs (with excellent lyrics), and Knockin' on Heaven's Door is a great single.  The film itself is fantastic, but only in its 123 minute version.  This album came in a time when Dylan had kind of disappeared from the scene, and the stuff he was putting out (like Planet Waves, which came after this), was really bad.  So this album is a breath of untouched air from a rather bad period for Dylan.  This album isn't just for Dylan completists, it's for even a casual fan.
B0010AN7Y0|5.0|I have  been checking on this film for over two years to come on DVD!  I had a VHS copy that finally died after so many viewings.  I will be pre-ordering this one.  I saw this for the first time in college and fell in love with the film.  Now Hugh Laurie is on my favorite show...House, and it is strange to hear him have an American accent!     This is for me, a quintessential friend film.  Though often compared with \\"The Big Chill\\", I prefer this british model every time.   With a sterling cast with stand out performances by Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson, it is filled with amazing humor (\\"fill me with your babies!\\") and tears of joy.  Not to be ignored is Rita Rudner who plays a wonderful character as Branagh's AA partner/actress wife.  Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie and a very pre-Umbridge Imelda Staunton are also fantastic in the film.  The most touching of scenes in the film occurs with the Fry/Staunton couple finally dealing with the death of their son.  (The camera shot of them sleeping cuddled has stuck with me for years.) Though it does fill the cliche, I laughed, I cried, I ... will buy this movie the minute available.
B000OVLBF8|3.0|I am a huge Marvel comics fan from the 60's through 70's so, it is really disappointing for me to see such a great comic icon get such a mediocre movie. The FX's are fine but, the story is confusing and tedious. Cage and Co. are bland and don't appear too interested in what they're doing. It's not terrible but, it's not great by any stretch! Rent it don't buy it unless your a real die hard fan.

B000HIVIOW|3.0|Between my mum & me, we got two copies of this at Christmas. I bought one for my mum, and my dad bought one for my mum. Talk about communication! Mum took the ones with the extras, and I got the bare bones edition, with Father Christmas on the same disc.<br /><br />I barely remember this from when I was young. I guess I knew it more from the score, and the infamous \\"Walking In The Air\\" track. It also got a revival recently in the UK with a spoof advert, advertising a popular (but disgusting) Scottish drink. Bleurgh!<br /><br />I just didn't enjoy it as much as my parents seemed to. I found it incredibly boring, and I forgot there's literally no voices in it. (Apart from a peroxide blonde David Bowie introducing it at the start.) The score definitely makes it up for me. It's an excellent score, and actually made me feel Christmassy. Always good!<br /><br />It's definitely a must have film, but I'd prefer to watch it if I was about 15 years younger. These things just don't hold the same magic for me anymore.
0385522401|5.0|This was the best of several of McEwan's novels that I have read. It's the easiest to read because it is brief and the plot is straightforward--in fact, the plot is almost non-existent. But therein lies the genius of this work. For 200 pages we learn only about the lives of two people who don't know how to make love on their wedding night. The vast detail and description of their pasts--their English upbringings, the historical point in time that they meet, the nature of their parents--all conspire against them, robbing them of the ability to consummate their marriage.  Their resultant inhibitions come to define who they are.     Then the final few pages of the book tell us of the next 40 years, but somehow this balance is just right. We know all we need to know and we are left to wonder about two lives so poignant, interesting, and frustrating. I don't recall ever reading anything quite so descriptively accurate with regard to helping a reader get inside the characters' heads. It reveals McEwan's innate understanding of human nature and his writing genius.    Read this book--you won't be disappointed.

B000WTNCQS|5.0|\\"The Joshua Tree\\" is a classic album that deserved a \\"classic\\" remastering job.  The original CD release had a muddied, booming bass sound with a lack of high end, muting Edge's sparkling upper scale notes.  The Mobile Fidelity release erased  these flaws, and showcased what a wonderful recording this is. Unfortunately, Mobile Fidelity's edition is now out of print and out of reach for most folks. This new edition is nearly it's equal, and can be had for a reasonable price. However, I strongly recommend spending the extra money and and getting the Super Deluxe Edition. The concert DVD is great, the documentary is relatively interesting, and the bonus tracks sparkle as brightly as the original album does. The enclosed photos are strictly nonessential. I have previously applauded the reissue of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born to Run\\", which has some similarities to what U2 has done here, but there is an important difference.  Springsteen did not offer  the option of choosing a less expensive edition; it was either the big price tag or nothing. U2 has done the right thing by their fans, and allowed \\"The Joshua Tree\\" to bloom magnificently once again.

If you are interested in investigating Simple Minds, start with their \\"Best Of\\", then head directly for \\"Sparkle in the Rain\\". All the roads intersect here.

B000002J1M|4.0|You listen to albums like \\"Foxtrot\\" and you mourn for the lack of imagination and creativity in most of today's music. There are parts of \\"Foxtrot\\" that are a tad over the top and a wee bit silly, but the sheer nerve and verve, the willingness to take chances and the musical virtuosity effectively more than compensate. I understand that \\"Foxtrot\\" will be getting another sonic makeover early in 2008. I hope more care is rendered to that project than the current (2007) re-issues from the Phil Collins era which lost too much of their musicality in a sea of increased volume and sonic compression. If they are going to tinker with \\"Foxtrot\\", let's hope they tinker lightly.

B000WTLDPU|5.0|I went into Stardust expecting to really like it and came out loving it.  I watch A LOT of movies (and love sci-fi/fantasy movies) and one thing I liked about Stardust was that it never felt like it was kicking you in the head reminding you it was a fantasy movie.  While watching the movie your brain starts to believe that this is the way things are and nothing is out of the ordinary.  There are plenty of other reviews and sites that cover that story so I won't really go into it except to say that I enjoyed it.<br /><br />I thought the effects were really well done, but the actors and the script were what I loved the most.  I loved so much of the fast dialog exchanges.  Sometimes just the look on someone's face would have me laughing (yes, I'm guilty of over-enjoying the Billy character).  There was a lot more humor in Stardust than I was expecting.<br /><br />As far as a HD-DVD, I know it isn't ranked high in several Tiers and that is just nuts.  I thought the picture looked really clean, the colors were bright, and it looked like it had depth to the picture; plus I could always tell I was watching a HD movie.  I have some HD movies that look just average, but this isn't one of them.  If you were turned off by the low video quality scores given out by some other sites I would ask that you at least gives this movie a rental.  I thought it looked great - not the best I have - but great!<br /><br />The last thing I will say as compliment is that as soon as it finished playing I wanted to start it over again.  I have a few other HD-DVDs to check out, though, but I will definitely be putting it back into my player many times for many years to come.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Being a fan of director Danny Boyle's films (namely, 28 Days Later and Millions), I had some idea of what I was in for as I entered the theater.    Boyle's film 'Sunshine' does not assume the viewer is an idiot, which so many films today seem to do. Frankly, I find such treatment insulting. So, when a film comes out without the anchor of an assumedly idiotic audience, I am pleased.    The premise seems like that of so many science fiction films, but the film itself goes way beyond. Intense genre-jumping ensues and beautiful shots lend appreciation to otherwise possibly horrific scenes.    To me, beyond the veil of religious statements and sci-fi 'what if's', the film seemed to be about making choices-- of any sort. It also seemed to be a statement of connections between humans and the value (or perhaps lack thereof) of a human life. Science versus religion comes into play and the age-old 'all humans deserve to die' concept, but those aren't really the film's most important aspects.    Danny Boyle beautifully weaves the characters through each other and into the plot and his amazing imagery and shot choices bring the film to a new level and help to play up Sunshine's themes. The quick slices of previous moments and the parallelism from the beginning of the film to the end really allow for a solid mood throughout all the emotional shifts.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|If you like fast paced action, we highly recommend this movie. To fully understand and appreciate it, see the first two, for Bourne Ultimatum starts within minutes of the end of the second movie, Bourne Supremacy.    Jason Bourne, superbly played by Matt Damon, is a CIA assasin who has lost all memory of his identity, and as he delves in his past, he finds so many passports issued under his name, by many countries of the world, that he is totally confused about the true nature of his citizenship and origin. He can speak most languages, and he does a great job at being believable. In this movie, while in Spain, he speaks such good Spanish that we had to wonder if he really does know the language of Cervantes.    As he encounters those sent to stop him from discovering the involvement of superiors in a program that is highly illegal, his lethal training eliminates anyone who comes in contact with him, and the action is so fast paced that we have seen the movie three times to fully grasp all the clues leading to some of the best scenes we have seen so far in an action movie. This is the quality of a James Bond... Jason Bourne... interesting choice of name!!! The locations are filmed to capture a global audience and it is such fun to see how he seems to know his way around all major cities of the world!    The DVD also provides deleted scenes that are great, and an explanation of how some of the incredible scenes are shot. Without a doubt, this is a DVD to own so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy... the best action film of 2007!!!

1590171993|5.0|As John McGahern writes in his Introduction to STONER, \\"If the novel can be said to have one central idea, it is surely that of love, the many forms love takes and all the forces that oppose it.\\"<br /><br />In this deeply affecting novel, John Williams depicts Dr. William Stoner's life with simple, beautiful prose. Stoner dies in 1956, having taught in the English department of the University of Missouri his entire career. He makes no particular mark on his colleagues or students, and he leaves behind a wife and daughter with whom he was not close. His seemingly undistinguished life doesn't readily call to mind the adjective \\"heroic.\\" Yet, this withdrawn man perseveres, and that counts as a triumph.<br /><br />The only son of a poor rural couple, he seizes his chance to append to academia rather than inherit the farm. His marriage disappoints both him and Edith from their wedding night on, and their daughter becomes his wife's weapon against him, but Stoner doesn't seek divorce. In middle age, he falls in love with a younger woman, but he and she relinquish their relationship when they realize running away together would force them to, as Stoner tells her, \\" 'become something else, something other than ourselves. We would be -- nothing.' \\"<br /><br />Stoner's most abiding love, however, is for literature. One of his professors awakens this passion that then burns on undimmed, although sometimes \\"hidden as if it were illicit and dangerous.\\" It takes about ten years in the classroom, but \\"he [feels] himself at last beginning to be a teacher... simply a man to whom the book is true, to whom is given a dignity of art that has little to do with his foolishness or weakness or inadequacy as a man.\\" This newfound professional maturity won't be allowed to attain full power though due to differences between Stoner and a fellow professor, Hollis Lomax, who rises to department chair: Stoner's integrity won't permit him to pass an unprepared student whom Lomax is coaching, and this impasse results in Lomax vindictively reducing senior professor Stoner to teaching freshman composition classes again instead of graduate seminars.<br /><br />In his last days, \\"dispassionately, reasonably, [Stoner] contemplate[s] the failure that his life must appear to be.\\" At this point, he asks himself, \\"What did you expect?\\" He reviews his life and \\"a sense of his own identity [comes] upon him with a sudden force.\\" Stoner sees beyond the disappointments. He recognizes that a life lived with courage and love is a life well lived -- even if it remains hidden from others.<br /><br />Occasionally, one wishes for greater depth regarding character's motivations -- especially concerning Edith's cold rejection of her husband. But this novel explores lives lived during the early and middle twentieth century, when many personal matters just were not discussed. The silent suffering of that generation is poignantly embodied in the repressed William Stoner. One may mutter irritatedly at Stoner for passivity, but STONER is a riveting portrait of a good, committed man who confronts life to the very best of his ability. Stoner is no superhero who dramatically overcomes all adversity, but he is an American hero all the same -- one representing millions of unsung real folk.<br /><br />4.5 stars.n Lomax vindictively reducing senior professor Stoner to teaching freshman composition classes again instead of graduate seminars.

0312360266|3.0|I did my best to start this book with absolutely no expectations--though after the high reviews, I had hoped.<br /><br />While Marked isn't terrible, it's... not that fabulous, either.<br /><br />Most of the characters are very flat.  The dialogue is stiff, and both it and the narration go from strong cursing to Zoey using words like \\"poopie.\\"  It's very jarring and detracts from the story.  (That isn't to say such can't be used correctly--just that it wasn't, here.)  Plus, a pet peeve of mine that almost kept me from buying the novel:  I can't stand the spelling \\"vampyre,\\" or anything but \\"vampire.\\"  It just seems unnatural, like the authors are trying far too hard to make everything special.  (Which also got to me--that Zoey is just OH so special.)<br /><br />I liked a lot of the concepts--that vampyres are common, if feared; the \\"sorority;\\" the Marking and Trackers (though I wanted to learn much more about the latter); the Native American history; the fact it takes place in Oklahoma, of all places.<br /><br />Overall, I'm only picking up the next book because of those good points.  I don't think the Casts are anywhere near as talented or refined as L.J. Smith (or the more popular Stephenie Meyer).  But I like fresh new ideas, and that's hard to find in vampire novels.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|If you prefer mainstream entertainment, skip this film - and this review - right now.  However, if you revel in strange realities present with artsy cinematography, then Memento may be for you.  Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a \\"condition\\" that prevents him from creating new memories, and thus he is stuck only with the person he was before his wife's brutal death.  Now, he wakes up every few minutes to a new life organized only by Polaroid pictures, notes scribbled to himself, and a maze of tattoos scrawled over his body.  Leonard believes in facts, not memories, although the viewer soon discovers just how tenuous the relationship between fact and fiction really is.<br /><br />Although the film begins at what is essentially the end, the progression is as chronologically complex as Leonard's own fractured sense of time.  The vignettes, with scenes repeated and extended, gradually build on one another to give the viewer a fuller sense of what is really happening.  In this way, the characters are plastic, changing according to Leonard's latest understanding of them and then vanishing from his consciousness.  There's Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss), two people who seem both friendly and malicious. Like Leonard, we have to learn anew about them in every scene.  These puzzling glimpses begin to assemble into something larger than even Leonard is willing to admit.<br /><br />While Memento falls into the postmodern realm of filmmaking, with its use of alternate realities and means of communication, it is not as riveting as [[ASIN:B000067J1H Fight Club (Widescreen Edition)]] nor as humorously self-referential as [[ASIN:B00005JLRE Adaptation (Superbit Collection)]].  Nonetheless, this film is likely to grow on viewers who appreciate the unconventional.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Well, well, this CD has most certainly polarized opinion. Before I wade in with my two cents I must admit that I have been a giant fan of the Beatles since coming from England to Canada in 1963 at the age of 14. As each LP was released I bought without delay. I know each one as well as anybody. As soon as one song ends on any Beatle album I know exactly what will follow. One of the reasons that I dislike \\"best of\\" collections is that they interfere with the natural and expected flow of a microcosm of life. Thus it follows that I should find Love unrewarding. Nothing could be further from the truth. From every angle listening to this latest Beatle \\"release\\" is an immensely enjoyable experience. To those who understand this would not seem surprising and requires no explanation. Accordingly, I want to counter the comments of several of those who have written negatively.<br /><br />\\"Mixing bits of song together is pointless\\". Why? Throughout a brief career this band changed the course of popular music and culture in numerous ways. The Beatles didn't do this by standing still. From the very beginning they were constantly on the move, experimenting with different instruments, sounds, subject matter. This is the band that created Strawberry Fields, A Day in the Life, Within You, Without You, Lucy in the Sky and Revolution No. 9. Paul and Ringo are happy with the Martins' work. I would fully have expected the John of several of his periods to have embraced the idea of diving into the archives to produce something that no-one else has ever attempted. I imagine that he would have been passionate, enthusiastic and argumentative.<br /><br />\\"You shouldn't interfere with a classic\\". They didn't! The \\"classics\\" still exist exactly as we remember them. This is something different. Sure, it is unusual. The sounds that emanate from the speakers as the cd begins are unexpected. As the recording get going and one familiar song morphs into another it is a jarring sensation for anyone who is even remotely familiar with the original songs. This is why as one listens to the cd he or she has to remember at all times that this is a new creation, dependant upon the music that we are all cherish but not intended to replace it. The classics haven't gone anywhere - they will always be with us.<br /><br />The sound is extraordinary. The alternate versions (entire song or mere snippet) are all interesting. I particularly love George's languid voice on While my Guitar. However, I do agree that we could lose the strings and gain by doing so.<br /><br />All-in-all I'd conclude that this is a mostly successful experiment. Approaching with an open mind is a prerequisite to enjoyment. Remember that every song on the beloved original recordings was a third, twentieth, hundredth or whatever take. Even then, the mavens in the studio would then have their way! Who's to say that the one that found its way onto the album was the \\"best\\" one? It is simply the most familiar one. There was only ever one Mona Lisa or Sistine Chapel. However, if someone discovered tomorrow that Da Vinci had created nine \\"unsuccessful\\" Mona Lisa's before getting it \\"right\\" I bet that the world would clamour for them.<br /><br />Finally, please spare us the ceaseless cynical suggestions that this project was just about the money. It is a soundtrack to a damn good show. Anyone who buys the cd or and expresses \\"surprise\\" at what he is hearing should have first taken the time to do a little bit of simple research.

B0006J28L4|5.0|This bio-pic of the one-time Nation of Islam leader Malcolm X is over three hours of richly textured history enlivened by a virtuoso performance by Denzel Washington.  From Malcolm's earliest days as the son of an outspoken preacher to his assassination in front of his wife and children, the film traces the evolving philosophies of one of the most influential men of the civil rights movement.  When Malcolm legally changes his surname to X, we understand why.  When he declares that blacks and whites should be completely segregated, we know where he is coming from.  When he renounces his ties with the Nation of Islam and creates his own Islamic organization, we see why this was so necessary, despite the danger.  Director Spike Lee carefully constructs the story of a fallible, intelligent, and driven man that disputes much of the media package presented to white America at the time.<br /><br />You definitely need a comfortable chair for this marathon of a film.  Although it probably could have been edited down to less than three hours by condensing some of the earlier scenes, such omissions would have lessened the impact of Malcolm's early days as a man in search of pleasure and easy money, values that directly conflicted with his later, righteous persona.  Based on the \\"autobiography\\" written with Alex Haley, the screenplay manages to humanize a man who was often publicly demonized.<br /><br />I can't find fault with any of the performances - all were excellent - but Angela Bassett as Malcolm's wife stands out.  The cinematography is sweeping, with a sepia palette for Malcolm's pre-Islamic days, and conveys in gorgeous, riveting images the power of the man and his cause. The special features, though worth watching, would be best left for another sitting, since the film demands introspection afterward.  Interestingly, Washington does such a fantastic job at channeling Malcolm that viewers will be amazed when watching actual footage.<br /><br />This is a must-see film for anyone with a serious interest in cinema, civil rights, and/or biopics.us interest in cinema, civil rights, and/or biopics.
B000ULPFH2|4.0|Fortunately the rest of the film is good enough to make up for it. The opening shows Carlito Brigante, former criminal, being hauled away in a stretcher, covered in blood after being shot. Well, now I know how the film ends. The suspense of the film's climax is ruined if we immediately know his fate. Duh!<br /><br />Pacino (surely more deserving of an Academy Award here than he was for his overrated performance in Scent of a Woman) narrates us through the last week or so of Carlito Brigante's life as he is let out of jail after five years out of thirty for mitigates circumstances coming to light. Determined to go straight, Carlito shrugs off all advances from crooks old and new but is eventually drawn back into a quagmire of trouble by his cokehead lawyer (Sean Penn dressed up as Disco Stu from The Simpsons, who also deserved to take home a Best Supporting Actor Oscar)<br /><br />The 145 minute running time passes in a breeze and there's loads of interesting story developments to keep you hooked. But DePalma's sterile widescreen photography and sets reek of the crassness of Scarface. This film is miles ahead of that junk (but let's not get into a debate about that) though I do think that a more vivid production design and cinematography and slicker editing would have stopped the film from looking so bland.<br /><br />I don't think DePalma is a great director but I do enjoy Carlito's Way, The Untouchables and Snake Eyes. The fact that he has also directed such godawful sludge like Carrie, Scarface and Mission to Mars only proves how unpredictable he is.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a frequently gorgeous 2.35:1 1080p transfer, it's a little bit soft at times but is generally stunning. A decent DD+ sound design and a fair amount of extras are also included.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this autobiography of Liz so much that I could hardly put the book down but at the same time I didn't want it to finish.  Very enlightening to read and such entertainment.  One of the best books I have read lately.
0140157352|5.0|1991 second edition, Penguin Books, 229 pages (of which 187 pages form the main body of the book).    If you've read any of my other reviews, you won't be surprised to discover this is another of the twenty books recommended by Charlie Munger in the second edition of Poor Charlie's Almanack (the most useful book I've read).    I have wanted to learn more about negotiation since last year, when I had particularly protracted and unpleasant negotiations over leaving my previous full time job. It was probably the most unpleasant time of my life, it went on for months and the return for that huge personal cost was very poor (for everyone except my lawyer, that is). My relations with all of the people at the firm were also destroyed by the time the mess finally ended. I figured there had to be a better way - and the sooner I learned it the better.     Having a single book on the subject recommended by a very well read and extremely effective individual in his eighties like Munger was ideal. If there is a single, most useful text on negotiation, this should be it. Fortunately, even with such high expectations, I wasn't disappointed. I would include Getting to Yes amongst the top ten most useful books I have read.    It makes an excellent companion volume to Karen Pryor's Don't Shoot the Dog, which I have just re-read. Getting to Yes tells you how to approach forming agreements between people (whether a divorce or simply which film to watch at the cinema this week). Don't Shoot the Dog shows you how to teach (whether animals, people or yourself) and learn. Between them they cover most of the important situations in which conflict is likely to occur.     Their general approach is the same: that efforts to dominate or be combative are unnecessary and usually counter-productive. The most obvious specific similarity is their suggestion that one always try to look at the situation from the other side:    \\"The ability to see the situation as the other side sees it, as difficult as it may be, is one of the most important skills a negotiator can possess.\\"    Many people (previously including myself) think that if one is not being `tough' then one is being weak. Both of these wonderfully humane books show clearly that this is not the case. You can be pleasant and understanding whilst still being tough (in the principled sense) and unyieldingly fair. What a relief to know that you can be both - and be more effective.    I found Getting to Yes rather painful to read at times, as I kept comparing the advice and examples in the book with my own experiences of the previous year. Many times the authors advise acting in a certain way and warn what is likely to happen with other (more common) approaches. My book is littered with scribbled comments saying things like `oh dear - this is exactly what happened in my situation'.     Most people view negotiation (I certainly did) as simply a choice between hard and soft positional bargaining. Fortunately it turns out that this view is wrong:     \\"If you do not like the choice between hard and soft positional bargaining, you can change the game.  The game of negotiation takes place at two levels. At one level, negotiation addresses the substance; at another it focuses - usually implicitly - on the procedure for dealing with the substance.\\"     This whole book is about how one changes the procedural game from positional bargaining to what the authors call `principled negotiation'. Principled negotiation involves attacking the problem independent of the people by focussing on interests rather than positions. By focussing on the interests - that literally must underlie all positions - the authors show that it is often possible to invent additional options that fulfil those interests better than the obvious initial positions. By insisting on the use of objective criteria, the authors also show how one can form wiser agreements and cope with intransigent positional bargainers (it becomes difficult to sustain arbitrary positions in the face of a negotiator who brings in objective, external standards to justify all of his suggestions).     It is welcome to see that the authors realise their methods are no panacea. They understand that the best a method of negotiation can achieve is the wisest result possible for all parties, bearing in mind the situation and the people involved.     I particularly liked the brevity and clear structure of Getting to Yes. There is a danger in `how to' books like this of being presented with so many individual pieces of advice that, whilst individually sensible, we find ourselves overwhelmed when we try to put them into practice. All the advice forms a sort of mental sludge from which little stands out.    I noted with interest the authors mention in the preface that their editor reorganised the book and cut it in half: \\"To spare our readers, he had the good sense not to spare our feelings.\\" I couldn't agree more and I`m very grateful to their (clearly first rate) editor. It reminds me of a comment Elmore Leonard made about his own books: \\"if it reads easy, it was because it was written hard\\". That's the way books should be.
B000QXDFQW|5.0|this is a movie you never see coming. It is awesome and everyone should watch it!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|If you can't handle sex and alternative lifestyles then don't watch it, but if you can it's truely a great movie. It doesn't have that fake slow motion sex scene you see in hollywood or the nasty-doesn't-even-look-like-it-feels-good sex in porn, but REAL sex. Great story line, Great acting, Great.
B000UBMZ4S|4.0|The DVD is great.  It did stop once and say it could not go on with the equipment i have.  I reloaded it and wrnt to that chapter and it played through as thouhg nothing had happened.   I haven't palyed all of the discs yet however.    Chas
1846370833|4.0|Very nice edition of a book everyone sould read when coming from or going to Devonshire.  This large print edition is being read nightly -one chapter a night-- by a 95 and 1/2 year old who did indeed just come from Devon.

0743486285|5.0|I read all the time, everything from Anita Blake books, to books to my munchkins. This book is one of the best bios {?} that I have ever read, it is up there with \\"no one here gets out alive\\" {jim morrison} I LOVED IT!!! I loved that it was honest and there was nothing held back. That he did seek out the others that were in his life at that time and asked them to be honest, was brave most can not face there demons head on.  The only thing I wish is that Vanity or Denise Matthews or whatever name that she uses this week were not there so much, I get that she adds to the over all telling of the tale, but there are times that she does not make any sense. Once in the book Nikki sums up what everyone else has thought about what she had said \\"Hu?\\". Sorry but other than this it was a great book.   If someone were thinking of doing heroin, or cocaine, I think that they should read this book. It may help recoving addicts also.   It has in it the very first concert I EVER went to listed in it, the Cajan Dome - Laffayette, La!!! Thank you for a great show that night, and also for letting me see GnR before Axle stopping showing up for shows...lol.
B00014X8KO|5.0|Otomo is able to break away from the juggernaut that is Akira in this three-part mastery. MEMORIES itself is three films in one, all overseen by Katsuhiro Otomo, but each possessing its own distinct self. I had originally seen Otomo's own animated portion called \\"Cannon Fodder\\" on YouTube. I was absolutely enthralled.     All three animes in MEMORIES are based upon their own respective manga. Each has a distinct visual style and the motion within each piece is uniquely fascinating.    If you are a newcomer to anime, this is the perfect introduction to what anime can do. The films are based around a narrative structure (as most anime film is), and this will help anchor down western-raised audiences who might be skeptical concerning the \\"validity\\" of an animated feature. The major hang-up that many of us get in to is that anime and animation in general is a kid's toy. This is mainly due to the fact that almost all animation in the US and western Europe is directed at children. Asia, and more particularly Japan, has been on the forefront of serious animated features almost since animation's inception.     MEMORIES is also a strong addition to avid anime enthusiasts. I can't recommend MEMORIES higher. It's an amazing production and I am very proud to say I have it.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|The trekkies at my house (husband, teenage son) love this product.  The packaging is flimsy and arrived through the mail in a damaged condition.  And, they are disappointed that Kirk's voice is lower in volume during the beginning sequence for each espisode.  However, these minor nits are outweighed by the awesome effects.  Purists may complain, but my trekkies love the understated way that the new effects enhance the episodes without being overly intrusive.  They also love the Dolby sound.

B000VNMMQG|4.0|The price was fair and the delivery time was excellent.  We have not viewed the film yet, but we did \\"preview\\" it and the quality was fine.
0893815187|5.0|Sally Mann is an amazing artist. Her photographs are not only immensely beautiful, but inspiring as well. I highly recommend \\"Immediate Family\\", it is by far my favorite book made by Mann. Set in her home in Virginia, it instills in the reader the beauty of family and simplicity.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Great movie, under explored series, that really hit the mark with the age old formula of Space age meets old west.  People who don't get it, never will, and those who did, miss this show with a passion beyond description. This movie was a world wide victory for Firefly fans around the globe, who unfortunately abandoned the concept of going to the theater to see it in lieu of crappy video downloads on P2P and Bit Torrent sites.  Shame on you all, you should have gone to the movies to see this movie instead of sitting at your computer watching it like hermits. Nevertheless, despite the fans abandonment of the movie version at the movies, we now have it on DVD and those sales have prompted the studio to produce a Special Edition. Hopefully this special addition will spark some new life into this R.I.P. franchise.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is an exceptional movie giving a real feel for the people in that era.  It is a touching love story with depth.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I saw this movie on cable, and liked it so much, I bought it(my criteria is that I have to want to watch it more than once)  Excellent cast in this twisted tale of murder, with lots of sly humor.  Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer are hilarious.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|So what if a lot of the time she sounds robotic on her latest CD \\"Blackout\\"? So what if there's loads of 'production'? It all adds up to Britney's most consistent album to date. One of the reasons I say this is because I've always dug her up tempo material and hated the ballads. \\"Blackout\\" is about ninety-five percent up tempo danceable FUN!<br />My favorite track is the 'autobiographical' \\"Piece of Me\\" that has some of the best lyrics of all the tracks (not a huge accomplishment but credit where it's due) and great attitude. Other faves include the dumb-but-fun first single \\"Gimme More\\"; the lovely \\"Heaven on Earth\\" which sounds like a collaboration between Brit and Kraftwerk. \\"I fall off the edge of my mind\\" indeed. \\"Get Naked (I Got A Plan)\\" is great in large part due to the weird phase shifted \\"baby, baby, baby\\" background vocals. With its martial beat, \\"Toy Soldier\\" is dance-pop heaven that I don't think has anything to do with the war. Some loops open \\"Perfect Lover\\" after which the groove takes over, a deliciously sexy concoction from Ms.S. The album ends with the one real ballad (also with lyrics of an autobiographical nature) and to my pleasant surprise it turned out to be one of my three favorites on this collection. Britney, let's go!
0807126063|5.0|People really will, because you'll be laughing out loud and pissing them off.  This is the funniest book I have ever read.  My wife bought it for me for Christmas, I said thanks and set the book aside.  Big Mistake.  This is one of my favorite books.  This also happens to be one of thoughs book that either you love it, or you hate it.  I let my daughter read it, after finishng it I don't think that she'll ever accept another book recommendation from me.  Pick this one up its a Winner!. But only read it in the privacy of your own home.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|There is a small yet growing and loyal audience for this show.  I must admit saw a few episodes when it was airing and though I really enjoyed them, I was never a devoted fan.  Then I heard it was being cancelled...you ever hear the phrase \\"you don't know what you have until it's gone?\\"  Well, it hit me how consistently great the episodes I watched had been so I bought all three seasons, started watching them, and managed to thoroughly convert my husband into a huge VM fan.  This show was razor sharp in wit and style.  The character development of Veronica and Logan (separately and as a couple) was non-formulaic and completely believable.  That is due to Bell's and Dohring's terrific acting as well as the writers.  Finally, if anyone can watch Veronica and Keith's father/daughter relationship and not think, \\"I wish he were my dad\\", I would have to say what the frak?! (inside joke, watch the show!)  The only downside is that the show was left with a season ender not a series finale so there are still so many questions left.
B000UVT3OI|2.0|All the songs were there but when you copied the cd to your hard drive, the information for each song was wrong. It was frustrating to say the least. I love Garth Brooks music but felt that this cd was poorly made.
B00004TDTO|4.0|The New England island community of Amity is gearing up for the summer tourist season with high hopes.  The 4th of July weekend is rapidly approaching and the businesses are all eager for the dollars that will get them through another year.  And then a young woman goes swimming and gets ravaged by a shark.  The series of events that follows leads to police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) closing the beach and calling in oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to supply information that could help deal with the problem.  Finally, the two of them join the grizzled Captain Quint (John Shaw) on his boat to hunt the great white shark... but the hunters become the hunted.    Jaws was a major blockbuster in its day and still holds up pretty well.  The acting is strong whether talking about the stars or the supporting cast.  John Shaw attacks his role with particularly gusto and the script offers him many of the best lines.  The story is a touch slow in some respects during the first half, but once Quint and company go out on the water, the tension builds quickly.      The plot has its weaknesses, primarily the extreme stupidity of the nearly every human in the story.  The mayor and town council willfully ignore sign after sign that the beaches need to be closed turning the situation into a true bloodbath.  Yes, they were worried about money but setting up tourists to be slaughtered wouldn't do the community any good in either the long or short term.  Even Quint, largely shown to be savvy and shrewd, allows several feet of water to swamp his boat and does nothing to pump it out.  Then he recklessly, seemingly purposely, burns out his engines leaving the boat to founder helplessly.      Jaws isn't perfect, but it is an enjoyable film.  It was one of the films that created the whole concept of summer blockbusters and those who haven't seen it should check it out just for its historical significance.  Beyond that, it's second half provides a suspenseful thrill ride as the struggle of man vs. shark unfolds.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|The movie isn't the WORST movie as most Trek fans will claim.  They're just upset because this should've been one of the best movies since it was probably the last we'll see of the Next Generation crew.  However the movie isn't good either.  Its mediocre, and yes, the crew did deserve a better good-bye.  The plot-well, it ahem, cough cough, doesn't really make much sense.  Its as if the writer wanted to create a WWE style battle where Picard fights some serial 2-dimensional 60s style comic book villian, & did every little short cut to get the movie to that battle, even if it didn't make sense or fit with what's been established in Trek.  It presents Trek as if its an adolescent genre more on the order of Masters of the Universe or some other sci fi for kids.    Its a shame.  Trek at its best appealed to intellect, a hope for a better future, & showing humanity have a place in that future.   The things I liked about the movie-it has some nice though not spectacular effects.  There is tight suspense in the film during the long battle.    I would reccomend against buying this DVD even if you're one of those people that happened to like the movie.  Why?  Paramount once again is screwing with you & trying to get you to buy multiple DVDs of the same movie.  Yes there is bonus footage not seen in the movie on this DVD, but not all the \\"cut scenes\\" are here.  I bet Paramount is banking on you Trekkers out there who'll buy this, and then a possible future DVD release where they release the yet unreleased scenes, then they'll probably want you to buy the Blu-Ray version where they'll probably pull the same stunt.
B00001W9G0|5.0|You have to see this; it's a very mature love story with strong political undertones and two people who feel they cannot settle for anything less than their dreams.      Streisand has been an actress that appears to have a love/hate effect on the audience; you either love her or hate her, for whatever reason.  She has a strong personality in real life and the director allows her character to show it full force in this film.  It's a classic that needs to be seen more often. It is more of a chick flick I think. And I think you have to see it more than once to get the whole emotional undertones; see Streisand interact with others besides Redford to understand her personality.  The ending is wonderful; what, no sequel?
B00005JOHC|5.0|I bought this for my wife for a xmas present. She loves it! Amazing how great writing can fit an adult comedy into prime time TV. Really terrific stuff.
B000VWYNNW|2.0|Some new songs appear on the rerelease of The Song Remains the Same, but having listened to both the original soundtrack and the rerelease, the new version does not match the original in terms of power and polish.  Some of this may be due to the lack of overdubs, but there are at least a couple of songs - No Quarter and Whole Lotta Love - that have had some great sections edited out, while Rock and Roll, Dazed and Confused and Moby Dick are just inferior to the versions appearing on the original release.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I doubt there is much I can say that hasn't been said already so I won't write pages of positive reviews, even though I could.  Basically the sound and images presented will astound you know matter what age.  On my HDTV with the optimal connections this is like being there in some scenes.  This set truly showcases what a Blu-Ray disc can do and why it is better than DVD.  I've tested both on my TV.    The narration is superb and entertaining.  The shots they capture are incredible.  If you care about the Earth at all, this will show you new things and make you feel like a better person just for watching it.  I gave this as Christmas gifts in DVD form to many friends and family this year, and they all now feel like they owe me a debt they can never repay.  If you are on the fence about purchasing this set, buy this NOW!  Trust me, you will be rewarded.    If you think this is expensive, I'll tell you after watching it I feel like I stole it.
630463949X|5.0|What can we say, it's the Mac.  They did a similar concert on HBO in the 80's but we could never find it on either VHS or DVD, so this later, more recent concert is the next best thing...We own may DVD concerts and play them on a big screen with great surround sound, this way we are not obstucted by \\"dancing fools\\" with no consideration for others....Great DVD.
B000YENUIG|5.0|There's a trend these days toward a different kind of gangster adventure.  Last year brought the Irish Mafia of Boston in `The Departed,' and this year has brought many other facets.  `American Gangster' brought a true tale of Black organized crime, and, now `Eastern Promises' gives us a take on the Russian Mafia in London.  Chillingly brutal, David Cronenburg, who also directed Viggo Mortensen in `A History of Violence' in 2005, nearly reinvents violence once again in `Eastern Promises'.      At the beginning ruthless Russian mobster, Kirill (Vincent Cassel), has a rival's throat cut in a brutal opening scene at a barber shop.  Nearly simultaneously, a pregnant teenager, a mere child, arrives at a pharmacy seeking a prescription while hemorrhaging all over the floor.  She's taken to the hospital where midwife Anna Ivanova (Naomi Watts) delivers the baby prematurely as the mother dies.  Honest and caring in every degree, she takes a diary from the young mother's possession and seeks a translation.  At home her English mother and her Russian uncle, Stepan, keep her company.  At first Stepan refuses to translate the diary, which only leads her to restaurant owner, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), whose only son is Kirill.      Keeping close to Kirill is a Russian Mafia driver, Nikolai (Mortensen) who doesn't take a back seat in the family business.  Kirill, who is gay, is both surly and affectionate with his recruit, but  Kirill is Nikolai's ticket to Semyon,  the mob boss.  Meanwhile, Anna startlingly discovers that the mysterious girl was a prostitute named Tatiana, one who makes several references to Kirill and Semyon in her diary.  Trying to discover the baby's true family, Anna tries to negotiate with the mobster family in exchange for Tatiana's incriminating writing.  Nikolai, although having a steely reserve, only shows us the surface, beneath which shows some compassion for Kirill's women in distress and some secrets of his own.      Suspenseful and mercilessly violent, `Eastern Promises,' using spare dialogue and tight editing, gives us an unflinching look at the underground.  Included in the bloodshed is a confrontational scene in a steam bath, where a case of mistaken identity sets up Nikolai for the knife fight of his life.  All plot points come together as a turf battle caused by the initial killing and Nikolai's full initiation into the mob family come to a head.  Unforgettable for its brutality as well as its logistics, 'Eastern Promises' delves into the frozen hearts of some truly unsavory figures in organized crime.
B00003BDXG|1.0|Mickey (Harrelson) and Mallory (Lewis) like to kill things. Animal, people, whatever, you name it: they don't want it to live; pure and simple. Mallory's incestuous abusive father (Dangerfield): DEAD; Mallory's subordinate mother: DEAD; anyone that has tried to pick up on Mallory since she learned kung fu: DEAD; and then there are the others that they killed just because. Sound pointless? It is.  Natural Born Killers claims to be a film that follows the rise and rise of the media using a journalistic fear of death as its base. It isn't. Natural Born Killers does not claim to be a deep and probing insight into the psyche of a serial killer. It isn't. Natural Born Killers could have been a mildly entertaining action movie without any pseudo-philosophical mumbling. It isn't. While watching the film it became more and more perplexing as to just what Oliver Stone was hoping to achieve in making this. Failing as both informative high art and low brow entertainment the film has no discernible audience.  The America travelled by Mickey and Mallory during the film's first half is populated by hollow shells and vague ideas of characters that are neither likeable nor believable, inducing no sense of sympathy or loss when they are inevitably killed. The only character possessing any backstory whatsoever is Mallory and it is one rife with abuse and familial dysfunction, however, it is not presented in order to give depth to or flesh out her character, but rather it is a vain and failed attempt to justify her later actions as a mass murderer, characterising Mickey as a valiant hero when he murders her parents. In a speech delivered by Mickey to an annoying TV personality (Downey Jr.) he claims that \\"Murder is pure\\" citing its abundance in the natural world, justifying his urge to kill as coming from the animal within. In a black comedy, this sort of skewed morality would be humorous, however the level of reverence that Natural Born Killers gives to this type of verbal diarrhoea is utterly ridiculous. The film is not funny or at all insightful.  In an obviously self-conscious irony, Mickey and Mallory are portrayed as the sanest people in the film. The fast talking prison warden (Jones) and the psychotic detective that put Mickey and Mallory into prison are equally as psychotic as the killers themselves. The fact that the media can make profits from broadcasting the easily discarded views of the criminally insane is not one that was lost on me, however Natural Born Killers does not take place in the real world; it takes place in a fantasy land purely of Oliver Stone's devising. In the real world a ridiculous quote about the pureness of murder would be refuted and stomped upon by the anchorman to assert the moral superiority of both himself and the middle-classes that he represents. In Natural Born Killers this quote is enough to convince the anchorman and the entire nation not only of the killer's righteousness but of their need to support them by picketing outside court appearances with \\"WE (HEART) MICKEY AND MALLORY\\" signs and personally aid them in a prison break respectively. What absolute bulls**t.  For all of its slick direction and competent use of popular contemporary music I felt like I should have liked Natural Born Killers a lot more than I did. Ultimately, however, the film is just mindless. It seeks to lampoon America's obsession with the psychotic and the ability of the media to create that which it skews however this is not done with any form of subtlety. The film instead provides a veritable bludgeon over the head through a few horrifically out of place monologues and a comic-book style of directing that compensates for, more than it aids the storytelling. It is pure style over substance.  Failed symbolism and a surreal atmosphere do not even come close to compensating for Natural Born Killers many glaring flaws.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|I've never seen `Sweeney Todd' before.  Touted in high school and offstage by Angela Lansberry who played Mrs. Lovett and lovingly reminisced over her role in an interview, I decided to take a pass.  The thought of a musical about the bloody (demon) barber of Fleet Street seemed too unsavory and too discordant.  Excerpts showed its potential audience scenes with beautiful music matched with too much gore.  I kept picturing something like murder done to Rossini's \\"Barber of Seville;\\" something that seemed like a bizarre and comic mismatch.  Trying to bring a `Green Eggs and Ham' (sorry) mentality to the cinema, I did get a shock; more than one to be exact.  Somehow it all came together.    Here's why.  First of all, Tim Burton, the dark director who gave us 'Batman' and wrote `The Nightmare Before Christmas' was the perfect choice for this musical.  The close up shots, the editing, the timing, the wide angles, and the zooming in and out are done to perfection.  The macabre atmosphere is perfectly framed without dwelling too long on any one image or scene.  In terms of cinematography, I kept thinking of Carol Reed's `Oliver' for getting every frame nearly perfect.  Secondly, Johnny Depp's performance is right on.  I was expecting the dark side of Johnny Depp--or Jack Sparrow without laughs. This is only partly true.  Depp comes to the screen in his own right, creating a familiar, but decidedly different leg in his acting ability.  There's the same confidence, but a real, seething vengeance in his performance.  He's not a bad singer, either.  Certainly, we need just enough of a character voice, which, unsurprisingly, he can do.     The story entails class warfare that I can only describe as the British equivalent of The French Revolution done in miniature.  Benjamin Barker (bka Sweeney Todd) is given short shrift by the aristocracy in power.  Judge Turpin's (Alan Rickman) unjust sentence takes his dignity away, and his daughter, Johanna, is Turpin's captive love interest.  Keeping a long arm is Turpin's weasel servant Beedle (Timothy Spall).      At a traveling elixir show, Todd shows his shaving prowess in a wagered stage contest.  Once he wins against Italian purveyor, Perelli (Sacha Baron Cohen, 'Borat'), he gains an enemy as well as a boost in his barber livelihood.  The barber of Fleet Street finds his supply of razors his method of revenge.  In the meantime, his love interest, Mrs. Lovett, downstairs has a pie shop, including a most bizarre method of recycling corpses released from Sweeney Todd's trap door upstairs.      The supporting cast effectively flanks Depp, including Helena Bonham Carter, who gives us someone both steely and sensitive enough to play the part as Mrs. Lovett.  Turpin's and Beedle's villainy are given just the right touch to ally our sympathies with Todd.  Again, the timing is awesome for building up such arrogant and loathsome antagonists from the Victorian Era.    While I may prefer the class warfare as it's espoused by Charles Dickens and Ray Davies, I have to take the tale as is.  And, as it is, it's a remarkably powerful musical voyage through a dark and grisly chapter of vengeance.  I must also note that, although 'Sweeney Todd' is by no means new, it is a part of this year's trend toward cutthroat violence at the cinema.  ('Eastern Promises' comes to mind.)  Finally, listening to the music, not only do the songs blend, but they add suspense to the story.  Any way you look at it, it's quite a feat.
075640407X|5.0|By all the stars and shadows I cannot give true justice to describe Patrick Rothfuss' debut novel, The Name of the Wind.  Even as an aspiring writer myself I cannot find the words to relay the magnificence of Mr. Rothfuss' storytelling.  This first novel surprisingly captured my attention and just simply walked by my side, pointing out all the glory and beauty contained inside this work art.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is the first book of the Kingkiller Chronicles, a trilogy of high fantasy; but, don't let `high fantasy' prejudice you, this is a novel unlike anything else.  It begins with an innkeeper and his apprentice tending to five regulars (of a town of maybe twelve people?), listening to the oldest of the group tell a story like any old storyteller of the day.  Happening alongside this part of the tale is a Chronicler - a collector of stories and researcher - who is mugged somewhere along a trade road.  As he walks his way toward civilization he stumbles across the innkeeper.  It was then the Chronicler recognizes the innkeeper as Kvothe, a legendary hero, minstrel, vagabond, and powerful magician.<br /><br />After pleading and pestering the innkeeper to tell his story, Kvothe relents and allows the collector to pen his story, as he tells it.  This is the start of Patrick Rothfuss' marvelous technique of storytelling.  The rest of the novel of told in the style and voice of Kvothe, telling the Chronicler and his apprentice, and of course, the readers the beginning of this near mythical hero.  The tale is told in an Arabian Nights appeal, with Kvothe acting the part of Sheherezade, and follows utterly and completely throughout the story in the distinctive personality of the protagonist.<br /><br />There are many novels out there with good plots, excellent storylines, and great characters, and this book has all of that and more, but the uniqueness of this tale is in its telling.  I not only identified with the characters - and even minor ones have dimensional reality - but I felt transported to this world, partaking in the adventures and growth of this character.  I laughed, became distressed, felt anxious, and even got a little teary eyed in so many different places.<br /><br />This book is such a delight to read.  It's so easy to follow because Kvothe knows how to tell a story while keeping it interesting, thus Patrick Rothfuss truly is a master craftsman to pull this off, especially considering this is his first book.  I don't want to imagine how Mr. Rothfuss is going to outdo himself on any other books after this trilogy, but for now, he has become a mentor to me as I strive to learn the craft.<br /><br />This book is kept within easy reach so I can refer to it for pointers but, more importantly, I have it available for multiple reads.  For anyone who enjoys a great piece of storytelling or simply loves to indulge in believable fantasy this IS the book.  It would be considered wrong, nearly criminal in my opinion, to pass by this wonderful piece of fine art.  I already miss reading it and am not sure how I'll be able to withstand the time for the release of book two.  So, for now, I encourage all of you to go out, buy this book, support this author, and, most importantly, experience this amazing tale.t transported to this world, partaking in the adventures and growth of this character.

Pink further advises that we should focus on developing both skill sets in every individual.
B000002UA9|5.0|hey, this album is special for those of us who lived this era - it is not meant to be evaluated for anyone else except as a passing fancey - those of us who lived this era have a special place for this album.  this was one of my first albums, released a few days after my 10th birthday and i played it to death.........PLAYED IT TO DEATH!!! and thank god my mom loved the beatles, too!  i DO NOT CARE if you think this is not up to your standards because, in most cases, you were not a part of this fantastic new experience starting at that time, so you are clueless about this whole thing here.  just like i was clueless at ten, but i know there was something cool, fun and fascinating here...and it blossomed in time just like i did!  so if you did not grow up while the BEATLES grew, then you have no clue as to why this is near and dear to those of us who have a fondness and gratefulness to have been there at the beginning of this era!  Thank you Sweet Lord, for letting me grow up when i did as life from the 70's forward just wanked out and been going down ever since!!! thank you, thank you, thank you!  btw, i have the Japanese release and am so pleased with this in my collection!  Enjoy, for those who know what i mean from living those times!

Your wonderful insight has helped me throughout the decades, thank you as Lennon is missed way too much for his insightful search for truth and cutting commentary, so when you came out with this recording it was a blessing to know that i am not alone and not losing it!  i won't try to regurgitate what others have done better (or worse)here, but your words were sweet, acrid and stung me to a bitter happiness that all that has occurred over the last 4 plus decades has come to this.  I loved TAXI as a confirm of what really has changed since its original release except that you saw it coming way back when and here we are now - cement, macadum and steel all the more!

6305428425|5.0|Funny movie especially if you remember the 80's and your 10 year reunion. Which I choose to forget!! Chick flick.
1881273156|5.0|I thought it was a very good book to read for couples whom are having trouble or just trying to strengthen their relationship.  I have passed it onto my brother and his girlfriend whom are thinking about getting married.  Hopefully, they find it well worth the time to read!  It was a very easy read!
B000W4KT6E|4.0|i bought this movie for the wife.  i thought it was pretty good.  the cast was pretty talented.  it was different thant the original movie but i expected that.
B000FP2Z0S|3.0|After hearing a couple of songs on the radio, I went out and bought this.  Unfortunately, the vocal style is a little too monotonous and becomes tiring to listen to after a while.  Granted the music itself is quite interesting and rocks pretty hard.  Still, as a whole the album sounds a little too similar from track to track and is not interesting enough to warrant repeat listens without wanting to hear something else.  There are some catchy hooks on a few songs, but unfortunately, they are either the songs you hear on the radio or sound like the songs that are played on the radio.  I really wanted to like it, but it wasn't quite my cup of tea.
0894803123|5.0|This book has a lot of great recipes.  If you are want some recipes to make ice cream with your home ice cream maker this is a great book for it.  It offers a great background on Ben and Jerry and a lot of tips on serving and such.  Easy enough for a beginner but great for someone who just wants some great new recipes.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Although I liked the first album from these guys, it never left a lasting impression with me.  It was all good music, but it didn't resonate with me like a lot of other groups where I find myself humming the tunes or singing along after just a single listen.  What a surprise when I discovered that this release was far better and way more engaging than the last.  The sound is incredible, and the songwriting is superb.  I liked every song on the disc, and I have been listening to it exclusively in my car for the past two weeks.  Even after repeat listens I never get tired of it.  The hooks are catchy, and the harmonies on the vocals are spot on.  I especially like track 11, Down.  It has a very ethereal quality to it, but it rocks out hard for the chorus.    I don't usually get over ecstatic about new bands or listening to new material, but I'm definitely sold on this one.  I can't wait to see these guys live, and I'm definitely looking forward to anything else they do in the future.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I first watched this as a teenager nearly 20 years ago, I didn't expect it to move me so much as a rather more cynical 30 something, but it did. There's really not much to fault with this film. A simple tale of Rocky Dennis, tragically disfigured by a degenerative illness, and his attempts to overcome prejudice, fit in at his local All-American highschool and, of course, get a girl. In lesser hands, and with a celeb such as Cher heading the cast list, this could easily have turned into something sugar coated and schmalzy. Yet though the feel good moments come thick and fast, Rocky discovers that in this capricious world, courage and niceness do not guarantee a storybook ending. As the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly heartrending to watch. Eric Stolz, as the boy (based on a real life character) is so natural and engaging that within minutes you have forgotten the layers of makeup which turn him into someone horribly deformed, and consequently feel his pain as he encounters prejudice and cruelty outside of his 'family', the protective biker group, and of course, Cher, playing the mother in a very fine big screen debut.<br />In the genre of 'overcoming tragedy and the odds' movies, this is surely one of the best, yet also one of the most painful.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|My husband has been asking for this movie FOREVER! The kids just did't take the hint so i bought it for him and it is wonderful!He is a HAPPY CAMPER!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Complete series in easy to use discs with many extra features. A must for Trekkies!!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Great script.  Great acting.  Right amount of intensity.  Whether running over rooftops, evading through a public crowd or directing an unsuspecting reporter to safety, you marvel how Jason Bourne manages to remain focused and quick-thinking and still out maneuver the CIA.      Amazing movie!
B000K15VSA|5.0|Okay, so its been 25 years since the release of Blade Runner. Over time this movie built a pretty sizable fan base.A few years ago Warner released this movie in a Directors cut with a horrible transfer and no special features of which to speak of.And the Directors Cut was not to the liking of the Director...Ironic isn't it? So Warner gave Ridley Scott the go ahead to make his definitive edition. This product exemplifies the hard work and dedication that every single person in the cast and crew gave. This product is the be all end all for Blade Runner. The transfer is awesome with crisp clear colors and very defined blacks. The Audio is just as amazing with its 5.1 surround sound. All of the special features are very interesting with amazing insight as to how the movie was made. Included in this box-set are all of the different versions of the film, including the extremely rare work print version. All of this is in a very nice plastic case that resembles Deckards Voight-Kampff case. Included in the case is a Unicorn Oragami Figurine and spinner car model. Also included is a lenticular motion still and a mock case file with various pictures of Pre-production art by Syd Mead and other artists. All in All a very good and very rare box-set.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:17065261]]Sorry about the quality (or lack thereof) of the video segment; I had like 15 minutes to git 'er done and this was the only take where I didn't blank out and stare at the camera for half a minute.<br /><br />So \\"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\\" is finally here after over 25 years of waiting and the million dollar question is: do I double dip?  The answer is an absolute \\"yes\\".  Even if the 3 1/2 hours of documentary on this measly two-disc edition isn't enough, you can always upgrade to one of the killer boxed-sets available and get the other versions of the film as well.  Not that anybody in their right mind would want to see the lame tacked-on \\"happily ever after\\" BS ending that was forced onto the theatrical cut instead of this or the director's cut.  If special features and alternate cuts aren't your thing, there's still the fact that this restored edition looks and sounds AMAZING.  Make no mistake, this is the treatment one should expect from a classic film of this caliber.  Eat it, George Lucas.  \\"Blade Runner\\" is an absolute necessity for sci-fi fans or film buffs in general and this is the way you wanna see it.  After seeing Ridley Scott's realistic and gritty vision of the future here and in [[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien]] it is really hard to picture our future being any other way.<br /><br />Buy it.  Buy it now.  Buy it for your friends.  Buy it for the children.  Buy it because you love film.
0061007137|4.0|This is a darker, more sinister, and violent Archer book than most I have read.  The USSR is still alive.  A document, hidden in a lost icon, would turn Alaska back to the USSR if found.  A page turner!  I enjoyed it.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This is the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.  You're missing out if you don't get this one...
B000ZOW96Y|3.0|Thia movie was very slow, with a storyline worse than the previous two. Save it for a rainy day.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|The movie came new-exactly as described. It was shipped fast. Excellent transaction. The movie is a classic and one adults and children alike will love for generations to come.
B0010AN7Y0|5.0|This is quite simply, one of the best films I've EVER seen. First saw it years ago on VHS, and was blown away. Have been searching for it on DVD for so many years, I'd really given up hope it would ever be available. The acting is superb! The chemistry between the cast is dynamic. The music is a potpourri of 1980's classics. And a great story. When I managed for Hollywood Video, this was a film I recommended everyone see, and I will say, without exaggerration, that everyone who watched it liked it. And a LOT of people watched it. Those who were skeptical, walked out with a free rental. And loved it! Needless to say, my store probably lost money on Peter's Friends, but it was all worth it. To spread this film to the public was my mission, and I served it well. Kenneth Branagh created a true masterwork, and for fans of \\"House\\", Hugh Laurie is great. Stephen Fry, Emma Thompson, all are great. I am not exaggerating when I say, you'll love it!
0525950079|5.0|A little slow getting started, but does not disappoint.  A compelling books filled with vital,captivating, well drawn characters and many twists and turns.
0375847227|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed Harry Potter but as a story with a well visualised world behind it, The Dark materials trilogy trumps Harry. I bough it for my daughter age 9 who devoured it and I started it based on the reviews. Having grown up on Tolkien, Lewis, Carroll and Donaldson, I did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised. It is a great story in and of itself, a struggle against evil with themes of loyalty, sacrifice, growing up, life and death all woven in without sinking under its own allegory.  Excellent writing, not dumbed down, characters are well fleshed out and Lyra and Will are up there with Frodo, Bilbo and other great heroes who had greatness thust upon them. Now for those who like to label the book as antiCatholic, perhaps it is, but even though I am a strong Catholic, I was not offended. It is fiction and any thinking person, religious or not has considered the elements in this book, free will, predestination,good vs evil and what they are etc. So all those who probably also labelled Harry Potter as Pagan deserve pity as they are incapable of doing what Tolken wrote about when he said (more or less) that most adults have lost the ability to imagine and enjoy fairy tales.  The quantum physicis elements are fascinating as any reader of Scientific American will attest too, and woven beautifully into the novel. The story is well paced and ends with what I think is a hallmark of excellent fiction - a bitter sweet ending. A great novel leaves one wondering and more importantly, caring  about what will happen to its protagonists and I hope Mr Pullman follow up. It is a pity that that the remaining trilogy will porobably not make into a movie, as all the religious nonsense written about it and the fact that the film was too complex for the average critic, will mean that commercial pressures will prevail.   Thank you Mr Pullman. This a story that I will reread many times.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Love it !!!
0399247459|5.0|My grandchildren love this story!  The larger format board book is very colorful and easy for little hands to manage.  I found it a real bonus to hear the author, Eric Carle, read his own work and the kids can listen and read along.
B000VR824S|4.0|excellent, but should have longer sets more Clapton, and the camera work was amazing.  Also this came fast after the order with back orders because of how popular this effort is. thanks amazon for great service.
0743298039|5.0|Recently while on an extended two month hospital \\"holiday\\" I went on a book binge, devouring more than 30 books (strict bedrest, and I am so not a soaps sorta gal)  And this novel rose above them all as the most captivating, entralling book I have read in quite a long time.  It simply begs for a cold afternoon curled up in the corner of a dark paneled library...or a comfy chair.  Vida Winter is simply one of the most fascinating characters I've been introduced to in ages. And Diane Setterfield has drawn her so vividly you can almost see the rings flashing on her hands, and the vivid red of her hair when you meet her.  While admittedly I am not usually a fan of the Gothic style (too much mustly dusty atmosphere for my tastes) this delightful novel is almost enough to make me rethink my stance.  Its creepy and uplifting at the same time.  I loathe to give away the plots in reviews, because often the discovery of the eccentricities of the characters is a large part of the reading enjoyment.  But trust me when I tell you..this book has some real whoppers in the secrets department, and they make this book one of the best to come along in a very long time.  Highly recommended.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|As an U2 fan I am very pleasead with the remastered Joshua Tree and all the new material included on this deluxe edition. As I used to have a Joshua Tree CD bought 18 years ago I could compare the good improovement in the sound quality. For U2 fans it is a must have and for those who are not it is a great oportunity to start.
0316067598|4.0|This is an excellent book and give a great account of what Navy SEAL training is like as well as Luttrell's account of the deaths of his entire platoon in Afghanistan.  I recommend this to all enthusiasts of Navy SEAL books (like Rogue Warrior) however, Luttrell and his editor needed to give a little more action-packed details about the gun battles with the Tailban.  In several instances, the author glosses over some of the fighting with non-descriptive, matter of fact terms that leave the reader wanted to know more.  A definite read.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I knew little about this film before seeing it.  Now I'm having a hard time forgetting it, although I certainly don't want to.  The music, creative process, and relationship between the Guy and Girl are simply beautiful.  I will spare the retelling of the plot since others have shared it, but this movie touched me deeply.  Two months after seeing it, I'm still humming the songs.  Run, don't walk to see this magnificent movie.
1401302378|5.0|You know, we're just getting started with this whole Internet thing, right?<br /><br />  As an information marketer, I must admit this book really captured my imagination.  The long tail concept holds that the digital age (bits) is allowing and encouraging expanded marketing channels that are far superior to traditional brick-and-mortar arrangements (atoms).<br /><br />  Consider Netflix, which can offer limitless movies while your local video store might only offer what they can stock.  The key to selling less of more is to make better use of inventory.  Netflix and other companies accomplish this by automating a recommendation process with software.  I've recently read that 90% of Netflix's inventory turns over every 30 days.<br /><br />  Amazon uses similar recommendation software.  In fact, they allow me to recommend my [[ASIN:0972329617 5 Cool Ideas For Better Working, Living & Feeling (Michael Angelo Caruso)]] book in this review.
B00006CXSS|5.0|One of my favorite Miniseries of all time. A lot more realistic then most war stories. You can't beat the whole set for $26 If you havn't seen it, buy it, this is one view of history you shouldn't skip out on.
0393324818|5.0|I thought I knew baseball, but it's a new day, baby.  Moneyball is actually the biography of one Billy Beane, a former major leaguer and now General Manager of the Oakland Athletics.<br /><br />  The new baseball is a game of numbers where statistics like stolen bases and home runs, don't matter as much as on-base percentage. The title is misleading.  Baseball is becoming more of a science than an art.<br /><br />  As a result of Moneyball, nearly every major league baseball team now employs a full-time actuary.  The book is an easy read and won't overwhelm you with statistics.
B00005MKA3|4.0|Survival, it seems, has been swallowed by history. Oh, that cover art was controversial, all right, but that's all it's remembered as. That one with the cover - depicting the Middle Passage -  that was censored in South Africa. Now, let's actually talk about the music contained therein, shall we? I think we shall. It's good mostly, brilliant occasionally. Musically it's just the same old, same old - there's not a single experimental album in Marley's catalog. There are occasional ornamentations, like a horn section on \\"Top Rankin'\\" and the title track, but for the most part this follows the same sound he had been successfully milking since Catch a Fire. But the key here is in the lyrics, featuring some of Bob's best protest material on tracks like \\"So Much Trouble in the World\\", \\"Africa Unite\\", \\"Babylon System\\", and the title song. Basically, he's not happy with the state the world's in, particularly Africa, which was at the time going through one of the biggest disgraces to human rights of modern times: Apartheid. Bob protests it at every turn, and not only is he pushing a very worthy cause, he's also doing so in an intelligent way - fantastic lyrics, unforgettable melodies, solid performing and so forth. The title track is an especially good example of this; and the similar \\"Wake Up and Live\\" takes on a similar bent. And \\"One Drop\\" is one of his most infectious, good-natured songs - a heavy contrast to the rather dark lyrics, don't you think? Only there are times on this record when Bob gets so carried away with his message, he forget about the basics of songwriting (\\"Ambush in the Night\\"; \\"Ride Natty Ride\\"; \\"Zimbabwe\\"). And it's kind of monotonous, but nothing I can't overlook, because there's a lot of great stuff here. You'd be surprised.
0061122416|3.0|This is an entertaining story but not outstanding in any way. The propensity of publishing houses to relentlessly promote well known authors is probably the reason for its better-than-deserved popularity. While I was reading the story, I remembered thinking that Coelho's style was very similar to the writings of Carlos Castaneda. Back in the 70s, when I was a young and impressionable college student, if a student did not love Castaneda, he was told that he had no appreciation for fine literature. Today, as an old and wise philosopher, I still think that Castaneda wrote while in the throes of a drug-induced coma. It was no surprise that the author cited Castaneda as one of his youthful influences. The message of The Alchemist is idealistic, if not juvenile. I've found that the way to make your dreams come true is to grab them by the horns and make them come true. It has nothing to do with talking to the wind or interpreting omens.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|A famous live album that deserves every accolade it has ever received. If you're looking for rock-solid, often amazing renditions of the classics, which were great to begin with, go here. The songs here have a funk edge that wasn't heard on the original studio album (\\"Positive Vibration\\"; \\"Punky Reggae Party\\"; \\"Concrete Jungle\\"), and they take risks with the arrangements, including a keyboard solo on \\"Stir it Up\\" and even a drum break on an overly trippy \\"Exodus\\". Lead guitarist Al Anderson also proves his mettle on several tracks, including \\"Concrete Jungle\\"; \\"Lively Up Yourself\\"; \\"Is This Love?\\"; \\"The Heathen\\" and \\"Rebel Music (3 O'clock Roadblock)\\". The solos on \\"Concrete Jungle\\" are particularly interesting, since they sound like Caribbean Hendrix. And Marley's straight-up soapbox protests - \\"War/No More Trouble\\"; \\"Rat Race\\"- are delivered with enough conviction to keep them from seeming like preaching. I mean, it's not easy to do that, because most people get so wrapped up in their cause that they forget to give us a decent hook or melody to work with. But this is Bob Marley we're talking about, one of the greatest protest writers ever, so he's very capable of it. Plus Marley lets his band jam on \\"Jammin'\\" (you think this was intentional?), and they really shine on it. Especially Al Anderson, not like that's a surprise or anything. I'm not in love with every one of these songs - \\"Exodus\\" is a disappointment, but it's not bad; and while \\"Kinky Reggae\\" isn't nearly as amazing as the faster version on Live!, it's hard not to get caught up in the slow, loping groove. Buy this immediately!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|\\"Miss Potter\\" is a spectacular movie that portrays a true picture of the life of Beatrix Potter - her hardships with her mother, her loves and losses, and what she did to protect Nature which she so cherished.
0441172717|5.0|This is a fantastic, tremendously influential sci-fi epic. It's a bit long (489 pages, but if you're up for the challenge you'll probably come off rewarded.<br />The thing I like most about this book is that it manages to balance every element of its complex plot. This helps him build suspense and makes him come off as an intelligent, talented writer. Speaking as a budding author myself, I can say that it's hard to do that without having your story collapse on itself. But with Herbert, it gives him a chance to develop his intriguing characters - the messianic Paul and his powerful mother Jessica; the scheming Baron Harkonnen and his evil nephew Feyd-Rautha, and my favorite character, Stilgar, a \\"Fremen\\" nomad. The \\"Fremen\\" characters (a humanoid race) are interesting because they really fall in that extremely gray area of morality that always results in some of the best characters, from Macbeth to Long John Silver.<br />The most interesting things, though, are the innovative ideas Herbert throws into the fold to make his universe seem even more realistic and emphasizes Herbert's imagination. For instance, can you imagine a science-fiction novel without computers? Well, Herbert could, that's for sure. Not to give anything away, but if you're wondering where the idea for Star Trek's Vulcan characters came from, I'm willing to bet Dune inspired it. Similarly, there's his vision of time being as nonlinear as you can imagine. And hey, it's true - time is not a straight line, since the future is so easily changed.<br />On top of all that, the book is VERY descriptive. I know this is a cliche, but I really get the feeling that I'm ON Dune, or wherever other setting Herbert used, on pretty much every page of this book. The art of showing and not telling is a difficult one to perfect, but I'd say Herbert had it perfected. And the dialog is very natural, sometimes with dry humor. You'd be surprised how hard it is to write natural dialog, but again, Herbert pulls through.<br />This is an amazing book.

B000R8YC3G|4.0|good movie, clear picture, great sound. i loved this movie when it came out in 2005 and truely feel it was the sleeper flick of the year. I bought this in HD just for the heck of it and it was totally worth it. The only reason why i didnt give this 5 stars is due to the fact that my copy has a slight video glitch which im not totally sure if a flaw on the DVD or a flaw from the factory. Overall, this is a great buy and im glad i have it in my collection
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|The Bourne Ultimatum is a wonderful action film. I now own all three Bourne films and I strongly recommend them. If you like action/thriller movies, than buy The Bourne Ultimatum. If you have not seen The Bourne Identity or The Bourne Supremacy than you Must buy the set.
B000RZIGYU|5.0|This has got to be one of the best HD DVDs out on the market today. I've never rated an HD DVD 5 stars until this one. The picture is crystal clear as is the sound. Wonderful movie for what it is.....that being an action flick. Like the other reviewer said, dont pay any attention to the tool who rated this movie 1 star. Im sure \\"Gary Tooze \\"DVDBeaver\\"\\" thinks a movie like \\"Gods and Generals\\" is a pure masterpiece......<br /><br />If you want non-stop action with some typical action flick cheesyness, this is the movie for you! Oh, and \\"Die Hard\\" is a favorite of mine as well!

1592332803|5.0|I purchased this cookbook for my daughter-in-law, as I had attended one of Colleen Patrick-Goudreau's cooking classes and it was just the best. My daughter-in-law was thrilled & I think if I can't get it back from her to copy some recipes, I will have to purchase another copy for myself!! So many wonderful recipes to try.
0743496728|5.0|The pressure students are under today is immense, and this book by Jodi Picoult depicts how the stressors of today's life-style can negatively affect those kids who are under the pressure.  Picoult's writing moves the harrowing story along from the mundane start of the school day into the 19 minutes of violence that anchor this story.  We are then brought back 17 years to when the shooter was born, and are shown scenes from his life intercut with the present-day repurcussions of the violence, and then into the trial itself.<br /><br />As a teacher I try to do what I can to educate my students about the dangers of bullying, but schools have a hard time policing this issue, and it is a rare school that can really call itself 'bully-free.'  This book should be read in tandem with book \\"The Overachievers\\" by Alexandra Robbins.<br /><br />Recommended strongly.
0618164413|5.0|Like so many people who grew up with Curious George, I always remembered these books, and these were always my number one favorites. When I saw that these are combined in one book, it went to the top of my wish list for Christmas, and I was delighted to receive it. Perhaps it's just been so many years since I read it, but I was drawn into the artwork even more deeply than I'd known to appreciate as a child (so apparently simple, but then so very engaging) and still giggled out loud at the stories (and wondered what would happen next since I'd forgotten). Sure, in today's times a book for children that involves snatching up a wild monkey and includes smoking or drinking probably isn't nearly as acceptable as it was in the days I grew up (just fine in my opinion, by the way), but this was for me - an all grown up kid who still loves, loves, loves the adventures of a very curious little monkey above all else, even more than I remembered. The book feels nice and hefty, and the pages are so, so smooth, too. I know the ones from the library as a kid were not nearly so smooth, so this was an extra treat!
0767817710|5.0|This was a gift for my father.  It arrived in good time and great condition.  Thanks!
B00005JLKB|5.0|This is a great beginning to an amazing television show. The pilot sets the season off very well and the ending allows for the next season to flow smoothly into it. Great Product.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I love the case and how organized and easy it is to see where you left off in the multiple season sets. It's also nice that the complete series is all together. Would make a great gift for any mother, sister, or best friend.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|After watching this movie at least once a year for nearly 30 years in black and white, this was a real treat to see it in color. I loved it. They did a great job on the colorization. If you love this movie you will love it even more in color.
B000NA28I4|1.0|To be perfectly honest, I sort of hated Christopher Paolini for putting garbage like Eragon out on the shelves and calling it a masterpiece, but, after seeing this movie, I feel sorry for him.    Eragon was a bad book that got turned into an even worse movie.  If I were Paolini, I would punch everyone involved with the creation of this film in the face.      I don't blame the actors.  They performed their roles with extreme believability.  Edward Speelers as Eragon and Chris Egan as Roran were adorably realistic in their little farm boy wrestling match and I could see the general idea behind Roran and Eragon's relationship in their interaction.  Unfortunately, like most of the things in this movie, it was only an idea rather than a fully developed representation.    Arya.  I am not the biggest Arya fan, but, goodness, what did they do to her?  If their goal was to ruin any chance of a cinematic sequel, they certainly succeeded.  Arya had absolutely nothing to imply that she was an elf besides a mention of being princess of Ellesmera.  And unless you've read the books, how are you to know that Ellesmera is the land of the elves.  Hell, without the stereotypical pointy ears, Arya is just a human-in-distress.  Plus, she seems to return Eragon's affections, which is so unlike her I had to laugh.    Saphira was well-done considering how budget the rest of the movie was, but, honestly?  Eragon has a baby dragon, he throws the baby dragon in the air so it can fly, it comes down a fully grown dragon.  An appropriate reaction would have been, \\"What happened to you?!\\"  I was laughing so hard I nearly missed the next few scenes.  The mockery they made of the relationship between Eragon and Saphira was hilariously atrocious.  And if I have to hear the phrase, \\"We are one!\\" again, I will hurl.    And, oh, more hilarity ensues when the Ra'zac burn down Eragon's farm with his uncle inside.  First of all, as far as I could tell, Saphira was flying him TOWARD his farm, not AWAY fromit, so how Eragon could yell at her for making him too late to save his uncle is beyond me.  Perhaps I missed something, but I would think that being on a dragon would get him to the farm faster than walking.  And then Brom shows up and tells Eragon that they have to leave now, but Eragon refuses to leave without burying his uncle.  Brom's solution is to set Garrow on fire.    Seriously, if somebody set your dead uncle on fire against your will, would you go anywhere with him?      There was so much to hate about this movie that it made Eragon the book seem like a wonderful dream.  I really feel for you Paolini.  I can't see Eldest becoming a movie after this total flop.
0618918248|3.0|Dr Dawkins makes an essential error that every deist and atheist make discussing their conflict. No epistemological axiom can be proven to be necessary. One has to assume something to create a coherent system of knowledge. The deists assume there is God. The atheists assume there is no God and continue with this or that version of materialism. Nobody has a proof but only preponderance of evidence. Both sides have temples - cathedrals and museums of natural history. Both collect money donations.    Dr. Dawkins should also realize that the world that evolved over last 20 billion years or so and the world that was created 6000 years ago to look like if it was 20 billion years old, can not be distinguished by a modern observer. The discussion of God vs. no God is POINTLESS.    Dr. Dawkins would also do himself a service if he took a reasonably rigourous course of meditation for a year or two. Then he would have to decide whether there is God - albeit quite different from what he thinks now - or whether he turns delusional himself.
B00004TWZF|5.0|This is a wonderful and very beautiful movie. I enjoyed it very much. Will recommend it to anybody.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I have seen very few Korean films, as I generally stick to Japanese and Chinese or Hong Kong films. On a very belated recommendation of a friend, I bought this. I spent very little on it and it was totally worth it. This movie takes time to really draw you in and then kicks you square in the jaw.     It has gore, but is actually quite subtle in its use of it...none of the over the top Saw style violence that makes you wonder why you even paid to see it. The real prize in this movie is the engrossing story. I was completely impressed! I have every intention of getting \\"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance\\" very soon!
B000YABYLA|4.0|Of all the offbeat, heartwarming dramatic comedies of recent memory, Jason Reitman's \\"Juno\\" is definitely one of the better ones. It tells the story of an independent teenage girl who finds herself faced with an unplanned pregnancy: a realistic scenario, no question, and for some, it's even relatable. Ellen Page--whose performance in 2005's \\"Hard Candy\\" scared the living hell out of me--plays the title character, utilizing an entirely different but equally effective emotional range. Sixteen-year-old Juno MacGuff is a lively yet misunderstood young woman, always making wry comments on everything and everyone. Some of her comments are downright inappropriate. You wouldn't expect a girl like this to be foolish and have unprotected sex, but as she says later on, \\"I don't know what kind of girl I am.\\"<br /><br />The baby's father is her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), a quiet, lanky teen who loves Tic Tacs and has a passion for running. One gets the sense that he doesn't actually say most of what he's thinking; when Juno tells him that she's pregnant because of that one night, all he can think to say is, \\"Whose idea was it?\\" In Juno's eyes, he's just about the coolest guy on the planet. But she knows that he's not ready to be a parent, and as it turns out, neither is she. This is probably why they both agree that an abortion is the best idea. Of course, Juno is unable to go through with it by the time she reaches the clinic; she said that it smelled like a dentist's office, and she couldn't stand the girl at the help desk (a goth-type who offers her a boysenberry-scented condom). With abortion no longer an option, she settles on giving the baby up for adoption.<br /><br />And as it happens, an ad in the Pennysaver shows a black and white photo of a couple looking to adopt. Here enter Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner), who live in an upscale gated community. As is the case with a lot of couples, their attempts to conceive have been unsuccessful; Jennifer is desperate to be a mother, and Mark seems ready and willing to be a father. When Juno enters their lives, they agree on a closed-door policy, meaning that Juno wants absolutely nothing to do with the baby after it's born: she doesn't want the Lorings to keep in touch with her or to send her updates. With everything seemingly set in stone, the papers are signed and the deals are made.<br /><br />Things start to change when Juno has her first ultrasound. She immediately drives back to the Lorings' home, hoping to show them a picture of their unborn baby. Because only Mark is home, an unlikely friendship is kick started: they have the same tastes in music (although they disagree about the best year for punk rock--Mark says 1992 while Juno says 1977); they both play electric guitars, Juno having been part of a band and Mark being an advertisement composer; they both love excessively gory horror films, and Mark convinces Juno that the films of Dario Argento are tame compared to the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis. All this seems innocent enough, but don't you already get the sense that something inappropriate is going on here? Not inappropriate in the sexual sense, but definitely in the sense that neither Juno nor Mark are setting up boundaries. He will, after all, be parenting her child; forming a friendship will probably do more harm than good.<br /><br />And consider a moment when Juno and her girlfriend are at the mall: Juno sees Vanessa in the kids' area, energetically playing with one of her friend's young children. This makes Juno smile, because it's clear that Vanessa is serious about wanting to be a mother. The same can't be said for Mark, who may not, in fact, be ready to go through with an adoption. Keep in mind that he and Juno never speak about the baby or even parenthood during one of her visits; all their conversations focus on personal interests, and as we all know, personal interests have absolutely no place in the life of a parent.This eventually begins to bring Juno down, threatening to destroy her already limited faith in humanity.<br /><br />All this affects her relationship with Paulie, who doesn't understand what it's like to be a pregnant high school student. Not only does everyone clear away from her as she walks down the hall, they also stare uncontrollably at her swelling stomach. Nevertheless, she begins to suspect that her feelings for Paulie may run deeper than she first thought, which forces her to put her life into perspective: while she may not always get along with her father (J.K. Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney), and while home may sometimes get hectic, the reality is that it's still home, and as the saying goes, home is where the heart is.<br /><br />What exactly would a film like this have to offer the everyday person? I questioned that many times as I watched, and my initial conclusion was, \\"Not a heck of a lot.\\" This is, after all, an oddball film about an oddball character in an oddball situation. But as I left the theater and began the drive home, my thoughts gradually shifted, and I began to realize that this film offers quite a lot. It cleverly shows that life is always in a state of flux, and no matter what we do to prepare, some unexpected things will happen. Granted, this is not a new idea, but considering how well made this film is--how relatable the characters are (if a little strange) and how nicely the story unfolds--it doesn't really matter.Juno down, threatening to destroy her already limited faith in humanity.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series of videos has surpassed all previous films about nature and the earth.  Spectacular footage!
0307346617|5.0|I truly believe this to be the best zombie book i have ever read. I live, eat, and did zombies.  I've read horrible to really good and Max brooks rocks.  I believe if the zombies rose this will be how it goes.  THe military being naive to the problem, and to the final realization and understanding of human survival.  Once again wow!!!
B000E1JOSE|4.0|I have always liked Roy Orbison's music but never hear it on the radio.  This CD hits the top of the charts with me because it's one of his LIVE albums and it has several of his well known songs.  You can feel the emothion in the songs, \\"Crying\\" and \\"Comedians\\" and feel your heart pounding with anticapation with the song \\"Running Scard.\\"  Out of Seventeen tracks, only six I don't listen to every time, when I put it on.  I could listen to this CD several times a week and then maybe only once a month, but it's one of those you keep near the top of the pile.
B00116FT6M|3.0|Conceptually, the convenience of downloading a movie for 99 cents to my Tivo HD is pretty cool... amazed that Hairspray painlessly \\"arrived\\" on my Tivo with a few simple clicks after setting up my account and placing the order.  Beyond that, I'd be hard pressed to pay more than a buck for a couple of reasons: 1)Resolution was limited to 480i & 2)After movie started playing, rental download could only be accessed for 24 hrs.    Give me HD resolution (at least 720p, 1080 preferred) a few more days of activated viewing window and I'll gladly pass on renting DVDs!!! ;-)    BTW, Audio/Music Mix on download version of Hairspray was great... no complaints in that dept.
B0011EP0S6|5.0|This is by far the best movie I've seen this year.  If you're looking for crude humor, explosions or special effects, save your money.  If you appreciate movies about real relationships and fantastic music, you won't be disappointed.
B000V6583C|5.0|This is a must have for any rock fan.  GNR was a breath of fresh air with this album in the 80s.  This is one of the best rock albums of all time with songs from Sweet Child o' Mine to Mr. Brownstone to Welcome to the Jungle.  The list of hits form this CD is significant.  This is by far the best GNR album.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|in addition to being a wonderful movie..we noted how the new DVD fills the entire screen..remember how the old wide screen had that black bar on the top and bottom.  This one filled the whole flat screen, with incredible images..
B000W1V5VU|3.0|I really liked the \\"Ocean's Eleven\\", and was fairly disappointed in \\"Ocean's 12\\", but the addition of Al Pacino in this film, I had hopes that this series would bounce back. But ultimately, there's nothing really special about this film. It's not bad, its not great. It's just somewhere in-between. The plot was pretty simple. There really were no big twists or surprises in the film, and the few twists they did throw in, you could see coming ahead of time. One thing I did like was the pacing of the film, it did move quickly, but almost too quickly. After the first 30 minutes or so of the film, you know pretty much everything that's gonna happen in the rest of film. You know basically every aspect of the heist, and how they are gonna pull it off. As far as acting, you can't argue with the talent in these films, but to me, there seemed to a lot of \\"sleepwalking\\" in some of the roles. People just going through the motions. No, there weren't bad performances, but it just seemed that the weren't putting there all into some scenes. And Al Pacino, well he was pretty much like all the rest. There really was no big dramatic scenes with him, and no Oscar worthy performances here. He came in, played a part in the film, and that was it. I just felt that the writers/directors could've made his role more dramatic, or maybe, like I said, Pacino wasn't fully into the character. But anyway, for whatever the reason, this film is simply ok. Like I said, nothing real special. As far as comparing it to the rest of the series, it comes no where near the first film, and maybe slightly better than the second one. Of course, it's worth watching, and I probably need to view a couple of more times, but I wouldn't buy this film with a brand new price sticker on it. I'm sure I'll find it in a used DVD store soon enough for half the price.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|An excellent movie for children and adults. Accurate roles played out in the restaurant scenes with humor suitable for all ages.
B000W1V7K4|3.0|This mini review is to inform you the transfer of this movie to BluRay stinks.  It isn't because you recieved a bad copy or a flawed transfer, this is actually the directors intent.  The film is grainy, colors are awkward and overall gives you the impression you are watching a standard DVD which you paid a premium for to watch in high definition.  This is true for both BluRay & HD-DVD formats of this movie.<br /><br />The movie itself is entertaining and you should enjoy it if you are a fan of the last two movies.  If you didnt like the previous ones, you probably wont like this one as it is more of the same.<br /><br />I would recommend the movie, but with the warning to BluRay/HDDVD owners to make sure they are aware of what they are getting picture wise... this is definetly not the movie to show off your high definition setup.
B000OVLBEO|1.0|The cool picture on the box is the best part of the movie. The story line is a painfully old one about a guy who semi-unwittingly makes a bargain with the devil. The only thing worth watching is the transformation into the \\"ghost rider\\". To recap, no story, and lean on eye-candy. Doesn't leave much. I'm a huge Marvel fan, but this is just a snoozer. Save your dineros. Go for the X-men instead.
B000002G26|5.0|Everybody knows Bryan Adams, if you don't, this album is a very good start, powerful rock songs and beautiful ballads.  All the best from Bryan, there is not a single song on this cd that is bad, every song is a hit.  Perfect score Bryan !
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|A great movie, but I'm going to talk about the Collector's Edition DVD contents instead.    I already owned the regular edition of the DVD. Being a fan of the series, I didn't miss the Collector's Edition release. I was slightly disappointed. There isn't much to watch in the extra disc. If you're not an avid fan, you probably don't need to purchase this edition. The regular edition should be enough.
B0000667RO|4.0|No doubt, their is many hits on this cd, but there is as much songs missing,  This cd is a good addition to \\"So far, So good\\".  If you want all the best, then you must own twose two cd.  \\"The best of me\\" contains more recents hits but has too many songs ommited, you will find these on \\"So far, So good\\".
B00082IJ08|5.0|I mean, WOW! I love Electronic Music, and I can't seem to get enough of it! But this album is great! Not only is it Electronic, it blends acoustic beats and industrial samples and stretches them to the perfect pitches!    It is pure beauty! I absolutely LOVE this album, it may not be as good as the FIRST Gorillaz Album, but it is very, very close!    PERFECT FOR A CRUISE AROUND TOWN!
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II, a real classic rock album, a must have.  Every song is a jewel.  Whole llota love, What is and what should never be, Thank you (my favorite one), Heartbreakder, Living Loving Maid.  If you like classic rock of the 70's and you don't have this one, you are missing an important part of history, go and get it !
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We have the original version as well as this much updated version.  Its wonderful. We all give it 2 thumbs up!  A great way for a family to sit down and watch quality television without the violence and profanity.  It is educational on so many different levels, and you will learn something new each time you watch it.  The feeding frenzy was great!  We saw it on TV and that was what sold us on having to have the DVD set.<br /><br />Its also something we know our B&B guests here at Kenai River Hideaway B&B will enjoy as well.  Its a very enjoyable and tasteful series on our planet, and I hope it will open some peoples eyes about how we are killing our planet and that without it, where would we be..??  Our resources are not endless, and many are running low and that affects a cascade of other things throughout the world.<br /><br />I would give this 6 stars if I could because we have all enjoyed it a ton.  Great for little kids, preteens, teens, adults and grandparents. Great way to encourage discussion about our planet, mother nature and what we each enjoy and treasure the most about it.  Enjoy it, we sure did and it has been great on a chilly winter night here in Alaska!!!!!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I gave my 26 yr old daughter many Christmas gifts, including designer boots, bag and clothes,etc., but she is most thrilled with this complete set of ALL the Gilmore Girls Seasons in one handy place!! The set comes with extras which include an episode guide which gives brief description of each episode along with pictures of all your favorite characters.  My daughter had 4 Seasons and I just needed to buy the 3 she was missing, but after pricing the 3 Seasons separately at local stores, it was close to the same price for the Complete 7 Season gift set at Amazon, as it would be to buy the 3 Seasons she was missing...plus they're all in a cute carrying case all in one place. My daughter just loves it!
B000HT386M|1.0|This is possibly the worste most inappropriate,crass,embarrassing UN-funny movie I have ever seen,the acting was poor and the story line was weak. I have no idea how it ended because I never finished it but even a sappy heartfelt 5 star ending wouldn't have been enough to redeem this one for me. My first clue should have been when I realized David Hasselhoff was in it,I should have ran and not looked back at that point. It is TOTALLY not appropriate for the pg-13 audience. If I could have given a minus 5 stars I would have, please don't waist your precious brain cells on this worthless movie.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I have to disagree with all of the other reviews that the theatrical version is superior. While I am glad that all versions are included in this 4-disc set, The Final Cut is the best version of the movie, by far, and is further enhanced by the gorgeous print and outstanding audio brought together for this latest release of the film.    Harrison Ford himself has stated that they did 6 takes of the narration which just never worked, and I wholeheartedly agree. While in theory it seemed to fit with the film noir aspect of the film, it was poorly done and detracted rather than added to it. The narration, along with the extremely cheesy \\"happy ending\\", were mandated by the studio and almost dumb down the film and remove some of its character in a way that doesn't happen with the Director's Cut and this latest Final Cut version.    The continuity fixes, the audio and visual fixes and the bonus extras make this an extremely worthwhile addition to your DVD collection, regardless of whether you already own any previous format or version of Blade Runner.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I just finished watching this amazing DVD.  The music, the orchestra, the band, the setting, and especially the beautiful young women singers and the fiddler are outstanding.  This is a video I will watch again and again. I am still in awe.
0812580346|3.0|In the very near future of 2009, two physicists working on a complicated experiment accidentally thrust the collective consciousness of the entire world ahead twenty-one years. Although the \\"flash forward,\\" as it's later  named, lasts only minutes, the aftermath is catastrophic. Not only are millions of people killed in accidents caused by their sudden and brief departure from the present (i.e. plane and car crashes, falls down stairs, etc.), but those who survived find themselves emotionally rocked by their respective (and sometimes shared) glimpses of the future. The two scientists are left to piece together what happened, while also trying to figure out whether or not the future they all saw was fixed or just one of many possible outcomes.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much: the story itself was fascinating, and thought-provoking, and the author is clearly an intelligent man with an intriguing imagination. However, I had a big problem with the execution of the story; Mr. Sawyer's a great storyteller, to be sure, but an awkward, almost amateurish writer. While the book was an easy, accessible read, I found it to be equally as clunky and frustrating in parts -- especially his shockingly excessive use of the word \\"doubtless,\\" which was so abundant that it became distracting and, toward the end, grated on my every nerve. (How his editors let it go to press with such a glaring flaw is beyond me.)<br /><br />Still, I recommend this book to anyone who's interested in time travel and is looking for some light sci-fi reading. And, in spite of my feeling toward the author's technical skill as a writer (or lack thereof), the story itself was compelling enough to make me consider the idea of reading some of his other books.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Really enjoy this light hearted sci fi show and very happy with the service from Amazon, though the DVD case production could be better, the discs become dislodged to easily and fall around inside the case.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|While this movie is often termed a musical, I think that is a misnomer. Yes, it is a film about two musicians, one male and the other female. Yes, music does play a prominent part in this film. Yes, there is one scene (on a bus as I recall) where the guy breaks into song when describing the love of his life to the girl beside him, someone relatively new in his life. Yes, there are lots of band rehearsals and all that.<br /><br />But this isn't Grease or Hairspray or Les Miserables or even Sweeney Todd. It isn't THAT kind of musical. So I think the word doesn't do justice to the film. It is very watchable even for those who tend to hate musicals.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, focuses on a guy who is trying to figure out what to do with his life in the wake of a breakup. Along comes a rather chatty young woman who hangs out with him and the two hit it off. I don't want to mislead the potential viewer  so let me stress that \\"hitting it off\\" is not a way of saying there is high drama and passion.<br /><br />The delight of this film is that it is low-key, intentionally so (if you get the DVD be sure and watch what the director says about the film). It isn't meant to be a typical Hollywood blockbuster but more of a slice of life film.<br /><br />I loved it, absolutely,totally - as did my son. He liked the music a great deal, much of it vocal music. While I appreciated that, I also enjoyed the refreshing look at two people who were helping and supporting one another as they struggled to figure out how their lives had gotten off track - and where to go from there.<br /><br />I think that gives you enough of a basis to figure out if the film is worth viewing. I'd urge you to see it. If you want high drama or suspense or a mystery thriller then don't take a chance on it. If you are up for a good film, nicely done, about two people and the normal ups and downs of life (especially as musicians), you're likely to enjoy this.
B000YENUIQ|4.0|GREAT movie by David Cronenberg with an absolutely riveting performance by Viggo Mortensen (a career high on all counts,)  Picture quality on HD-DVD is stunning, with the gloomy dark exteriors of modern-day London perfectly captured, along with food-rich, colorful Russian festivities.  My one complaint is that about 1/4 of my English subtitles were \\"cut off\\" on the left side of the screen. I'm playing my HD-DVDs on a Toshiba HD-2 player that has never presented that problem with other HD-DVDs.  It was annoying to not be able to read the entire subtitle, but for the most part, not difficult to figure out what was missing. Anyone else have this problem with this title? Please post.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|If you like this music, please, I urge you...go to see the movie Once as well and then buy that soundtrack. You'll get an idea of the music from that or just do a seach on You know what Tube and you can see performances of many of the songs from this CD.<br /><br />  I'd go into more detail about the music but I rarely find WRITTEN reviews of music to be all that revealing. The best I could do would be to  write that it was \\"atypical\\" or a \\"bit folksy\\" and that'd still be way off the mark. So I'll simply suggest you listen to the musical samples here and then go to that you know what tube and hear the complete versions of songs from the CD..that is a much better way to get a taste of the music. I do recommend this one.<br /><br />  If you catch the movie, you'll discover that both the male and female singers can act and do so in a very low-key, believable way. The music? It is every bit as lovely as you'd expect and you get to see how musicians think and the process of creativity all set to a love story - sort of. Just see it. Then buy this CD and the one to Once and allow yourself to be transported by music that isn't trite, overdone or screaming to be heard. This makes it so much more appealing, of course, and I can't stop playing it, over and over. Bravo!

B0001KZM3O|3.0|\\"The Final Cut\\" would prove to be the album that pretty much broke up the band.  Keys player Richard Wright was already gone with only Waters, Gilmour, and Mason appearing on this album.  For the most part this is a solo album from Roger Waters with Gilmour and Mason taking diminished roles in both the writing and playing on the disc.  Gilmour's' guitar solos are few and far between and he only sings vocals on one track \\"Not Now John\\".  The album is dark and moody and very similar to the solo albums that Roger Waters would go on to do after his departure from Floyd.  I was very disappointed with this one when it came out, but over the years I have come to appreciate it for what it is.  The main theme of the album concerns post World War II England mixed in with the Falkland Island war that was happening at the time of the albums writing.  There are lots of references to Regan, Thatcher and other 80's political figures, which tends to date the album a bit.  Overall the lyrics are good, but the music is somewhat lacking.  There are a few great tracks here though including the title track, and \\"The Gunners Dream\\".  Overall this is not nearly as good as Pink Floyd's best albums, but it is also not as bad as some people have made it out to be.
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|The Die Hard series went downhill since the original but this one definitely helped pull the ratings up.  Plenty of action, shooting, and technology to make Die Hard interesting again.  The scene where the squad car is used to \\"kill\\" the helicopter is hilarious, worth watching over and over and over again.  Some extra features are available though flashback to the 80's Die Hard's isn't all that interesting and only reminds ones what movies were like prior to Blu-Ray: grainy and full of static.  Also, one can only wonder why Chinese and Korean subtitle would be available but not French. (It's one of the options but doesn't actually show anything if chosen)  This BD may go back just because of that.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard [Blu-ray]
B000002A3T|5.0|After much legal wrangling David Gilmour put Pink Floyd back together with Nick Mason in the early 90's.  They released the decent \\"Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\" album with Richard Wright returning to the fold for the tour.  \\"The Division Bell\\" was the 2nd album from the 3 piece non Roger Waters era lineup.  A lot of people tend to write off the Water less version of Floyd while another whole new generation of fans were turned on to Floyd with these two albums.  Personally I have always really liked \\"The Division Bell\\" and think it is a very good album.  The re-emergence of Richard Wright as a songwriter really ads to this album (he even sings \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\") and as on some of the early Floyd works he compliments David Gilmour's writing and playing perfectly.  There are several songs about past band members including \\"Poles Apart\\" about Syd Barret and \\"Lost For Words\\" which is a blatant stab at Roger Waters.  At the end of the song Gilmour sings, \\"So I open my door to my enemies, and I ask could we wipe the slate clean, but they tell me to please go f#*k myself\\" then Richard Wright sings the last line \\"You know you just can't win\\".  In the CD booklet the lyrics appear next to a picture of a pair of boxing gloves.  Great stuff that just helped to ad fuel to the fire that was the Gilmour vs. Water feud that lasted until the Live 8 concert in 2006.  The biggest highlight on this album is the final song \\"High Hopes\\" which for me ranks right up with the best stuff Pink Floyd has done.  The song is everything that is great about Pink Floyd.  \\"The Division Bell\\" receives very mixed reviews from Floyd fans.  Some love it and some loath it.  For me I think it is a very good album and if this indeed the last statement from Pink Floyd it was a nice way to go out.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|My family loves Lost.  Of course, I would recommend the series.  One of our favorites.
B000006TRV|5.0|\\"The Wall\\" was one of the single biggest albums of the 70's and proved to be a commercial landslide for Pink Floyd.  The two album concept piece is Roger Waters masterpiece about a musician named \\"Pink\\" and the wall he builds around himself.  The album is primarily autobiographical and served as the final link in the Waters takeover of the band.  It is also the last album with the Waters, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright lineup (Keyboard player Richard Wright would be fired shortly after the albums completion).  The album was an unlikely smash hit with the band getting airplay on top 40 radio stations for the first time in their long career.  \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Hey You\\", and \\"Run Like Hell\\" are still staples of classic rock stations to this day.  The album was also made into a movie in the mid - 80's.  As overplayed as this album was and as much as I have listened to it over the years, I still enjoy it and think it is a great piece of work.  David Gilmour's guitar solo on \\"Comfortably Numb\\" can still send chills up my spine and is one of the great melodic solos of all time in my opinion.  \\"The Wall\\" is one of the classic progressive rock albums of all time.
B00000JNNY|5.0|This is one of the most pleasurable CDs on the market.  This collection of Etta's songs showcases her considerable talent as a blues singer. Though the instrumentation is dated on some of the songs (the strings soar a little too high), her voice saves the day, alternately powerful and vulnerable.<br /><br />Her version of \\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\\" rocks harder than the Rolling Stones version, and that is no small feat.  'At Last' is a great song, and her vocal interpretation is the best out of many artists who attempted it.  'Sunday Kind of Love' is another masterpiece, as is her rendition of 'Stormy Weather'.  Not a bad song on the record.<br />Etta James is a national treasure.  Thanks for the beautiful, heart-felt music.<br /><br />As an aside, does anyone else see a resemblance between Etta's singing and Janis Joplin?
B00000GAIW|5.0|Progressive rockers Jethro Tull released their fourth album Aqualung in April of 1971.<br />By 1971, Jethro Tull were a modestly successful blues rock band spearheaded by lead singer/songwriter Ian Anderson, a wild-eyed Englishman decked out in tights and sashes and using a FLUTE as his rock and roll weapon of choice. Anderson was joined by guitarist Martin Barre (still Tull's guitarist today), keyboard player John Evan, then-new bass player Jeffrey Hammond (who replaced original bass player Glenn Cornice) and drummer Clive Bunker (whom left the band after this album was finished).<br />Contrary to popular belief, Aqualung is not a concept album. However, the songs all have different topics from religion to homeless people to life in general. Many people always say Jethro Tull suck with comments like \\"they are minstrel rock\\", \\"boring\\" among others. Tull combined rock with folk so well that they made many a great albums. Here is the synopsis of Aqualung.<br />The album's opening title cut introduces to a man named Aqualung who happens to be a homeless man. The music and the lyrics to this epic are just excellent on this rock radio staple which is probably playing on the radio as I write this. Next is \\"Cross Eyed Mary\\" which is a rocker about a dirty girl who did things that the good girls didn't dare try. The flute is superb here and Barre's guitar just rocked here. We have a nice short breather, the autobiographical \\"Cheap Day Return\\" which is acoustic in nature. We follow with the folkish-rocker \\"Mother Goose\\" which is another great song. Next is the relatively short but sweet \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\" is next and also autobiographical. \\"Up to Me\\" rounds out the first half and is a great song.<br />The album's second half which is Pro-God/anti-organized religion in theme and content starts with the epic \\"My God\\" which is a great song. Next was the album's third rock radio staple \\"Hymn 43\\" which is a great rocker. \\"Slipstream\\" follows and is a short acoustic breather from the second half which is \\"pro-God and anti-Religion\\" in tone. Next is the last rock radio staple from the album the chugging rocker \\"Locomotive Breath\\" and God is referred to as \\"Old Charlie\\" and just an awesome song with a superb Anderson flute solo. The album closes with another epic fittingly called \\"Wind Up\\" which winds up this album in a grand way.<br />Aqualung was the album that made Jethro Tull stars in the US as it reached #7 on the Billboard album chart and sold millions rightfully so to this day.<br />In 1996, Chrysalis/EMI re-issued the album as a digitally remastered version for its 25th anniversary with many bonus tracks (this remaster was eventually released in the US in 1999). First is the outtake \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean\\" which is a great song. Next is a different mix of Wind Up from the Quadraphonic Version of Aqualung but catchy. Then its excerpts from an Ian Anderson Interview in 1996 which was done for a British magazine but a similar interview was done for the show In the Studio with Redbeard and was slightly more informative but still a great interview. Next is a BBC recording of Song for Jeffrey which is great. Another BBC session with Fat Man is next and is a great version of this old Tull track. A BBC version of Bouree which is Anderson's trademark flute solo closes this re-issue.<br />Aqualung still sounds fresh and reverant today and this re-issue is recommended!he second half which is \\"pro-God and anti-Religion\\" in tone.

B000SNUMC0|5.0|Well, I won't waste your time here - If you didn't like Iced Earth to begin with you wouldn't be reading this. If you are new to Iced Earth go ahead and buy it; you won't be disappointed. Iced Earth is one of the \\"truest\\" practicioners of heavy metal. They've always been heavy, yet complex and melodic, and they haven't changed a bit. Personally, I miss Matt Barlow on vocals, but, if you have to replace him, then Mr. Owens is a pretty safe bet. So, if you're already an I.E. fan, buy it - you won't regret it. If you are new to I.E., buy it - you will definitely have a new favorite Heavy Metal band.
B00006JKOL|5.0|Jethro Tull's eighth studio and ninth overall album Minstrel in the Gallery was released in September of 1975.<br />At the time of the release of Minstrel, Jethro Tull was one of the biggest bands in the world having released six consecutive US Gold selling albums (five of them which hit the US Top 10).<br />Lead singer/songwriter/flute player Ian Anderson, guitarist Martin Barre, drummer Barriemore Barlow, keyboard player John Evan and bass player Jeffrey Hammond (whom would leave the band after the tour for Minstrel to take up painting and art) started work on the follow-up to 1974's successful War Child on the Maison Rouge mobile and created an album which is one of the classic Tull albums.<br />I always get a kick out of people trying to fit Jethro Tull into any particular type of music, because they are just plain not anything. While they have elements of hard rock/metal, elements of pop, elements of progressive, elements of folk, elements of renaissance, and even a bit of classical here and there, they are all of the above and none of the above. They just are.<br />The opening eight minute plus title cut begins with album in a grand way. The first part of the track is a great minstrel-folk beginning which then gives way into a classic hard rocker with some tasty guitar playing from Barre. Next is Cold Wind to Valhalla which starts out like a renaissance era folk tune but then turns into a great hard but bluesy rocker (which has Barre doing both lead guitar and some great slide guitar). Excellent use of violins in this song to help the orchestration. Who said strings and rock don't mix. Next is another classic, the epic called Black Satin Dancer which features some hard rock riffs and the trademark Anderson folk influences. Its lyrics tell of sexual foreplay and intense longing, perhaps even lust. Unlike fellow prog bands like ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Yes, Tull added some hard rock/heavy metal elements to their works. A most excellent song. The first side ends with an acoustic ballad called Requiem which sounds like it could have appeared on either a Simon and Garfunkel album or even The Beatles' Rubber Soul but is still classic Tull.<br />The album's second side kicks off with another acoustic number called One White Duck/0^10 = Nothing at All which is a great song. Next is the band's first 10 minute plus track since the 1973 album length epic A Passion Play called Baker St. Muse. The song tells the story about a muse, a very down-to-earth fellow crying out that Jethro Tull wasn't the commercial group that War Child almost made them out to be. The lyrics state that we're still in the gutter singing about things that haven't changed. The other parts of the epic are stories of the street, likely stories of the Baker St. Muse (aka Jethro Tull). These vignettes are very sexual. Had they been released between 1986 and now, they'd probably have a Parental Advisory label. This lengthy piece is their best epic since the Thick as a Brick suite though A Passion Play had its moments. We end the album with the short tune Grace which is a short but affective way to close the album.<br />Minstrel in the Gallery reached #7 on the Billboard album chart in late 1975 and went Gold immediately. Unfortunately, this was their last studio album with bass player Jeffrey Hammond who would retire from music to take up art and painting.<br />In 2002, Chrysalis Records (in association with Capitol Records in the US and EMI elsewhere), re-released the album as a digitally remastered CD. The re-issue features five bonus tracks which were the album outtakes Summerdays Sands, March the Mad Scientist and Pan Dance plus live versions of Minstrel in the Gallery and Cold Wind to Valhalla.<br />This Tull album is RECOMMENDED IMMENSELY!acoustic ballad called Requiem which sounds like it could have appeared on either a Simon and Garfunkel album or even The Beatles' Rubber Soul but is still classic Tull.

I have never assigned a book that my high school juniors have enjoyed more.  And now, with \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" Hosseini has done it again.  I couldn't put it down.  I shook my head in disbelief and gasp in horror at the plight of these characters, especially the women and children.  Hosseini does an amazing job interweaving the history of Afghanistan within the plot of his latest work.  Miriam's love and sacrifice will break your heart. I can't wait to share this wonderful book with my new students!
B00008G9JN|5.0|Jethro Tull's tenth studio album entitled Songs From The Wood was released in February of 1977.<br />The album saw the band (which comprised of lead singer/songwriter/flute player Ian Anderson plus guitarist Martin Barre, keyboard player John Evan, drummer Barriemore Barlow, bass player John Glascock whom were now joined by orchestrator David Palmer as second keyboard player) go in a different musical route after the dismal sales of 1976's concept album Too Old To Rock and Roll Too Young to Die (despite the fact that album is one of my personal favorites which was overlooked in the year of  Frampton Comes Alive, \\"Afternoon Delight\\" and many of the disco trash starting to infiltrate music in 1976). The Songs From The Wood album when released was the folkiest in sound that the band had recorded up to that point. Was it a good or bad thing, read on and find out as I did when I heard the album on vinyl late in 2006 and then acquired the remastered CD a few months ago.<br />The title cut opens the album with a superb and funnyish sounding acapella singing which then gives way into a killer song with it ping-ponging between folk and classic hard rock tinged prog rock.<br />The next track is the acoustic number \\"Jack-in-the-Green\\" which tells about an old protector and nurturer of the English woods. The track also states if Jack still exists in this modern world of cars and power lines amongs other things. \\"Beltane\\" follows and is another great tune. We follow with the rocker \\"Hunting Girl\\" which uses a foxhunting equestrienne as a metaphor to a high-born woman who takes advantage of a lower class person. Great rocker. The first side closed with the band's second Holiday season track \\"Ring Out Solstice Bells\\" which is a great number to play at Christmas.<br />The second half of the album starts with \\"Velvet Green\\" which is as folk influenced as can be. The track is a love song set in the folk mentality. \\"The Whistler\\" follows and is another English folk influenced number which tells of a minstrel type individual. Next is the epic \\"Pibroch (Hat in Hand)\\" which is a rocker with some folk music influences but just burns! The original album ends with the folk number \\"Fire at Midnight\\" which celebrates a fellow relaxing by the fire with his love at the end of a long, hard day.<br />The Songs From The Wood album originally peaked at #8 on the Billboard album chart (to date Tull's last US Top 10 charting album) and was the band's first million seller since 1975's Minstrel in the Gallery.<br />In 2003, the album was re-released as a remastered CD with two additional songs. First is \\"Beltane\\" which is a great number about celebration of the Celtic festival Beltane.

B00006JKON|5.0|Jethro Tull's seventh studio album and eighth album overall entitled War Child was released in October of 1974.<br />After having back to back to back successes with their three previous studio efforts, 1971's Aqualung, 1972's Thick As A Brick and 1973's A Passion Play, Jethro Tull were faced with releasing another hit album as the latter two hit #1 in the US. Warchild marked the first time since 1971's Aqualung that the band would return to the shorter song format as TAAB and APP were actually album-length songs.<br />Lead singer and flautist Ian Anderson, guitarist Martin Barre, bass player Jeffrey Hammond, keyboard player John Evan and drummer Barriemore Barlow went to Morgan Studios in London (with some bits leftover from a disastrous session at Chateau D'Herouville in France) to work on a sort of back to basics album which was intended to be a soundtrack to a film that didn't take off and after the critical pasting that A Passion Play received despite peaking at #1 in the US. Would this album be classic Tull or did they become what the critics were complaining about, read on.<br />Warchild's lyrics were whimsical ranging from society and religion to attacks on music critics themselves (The track Only Solitaire was arguably aimed at L.A. Times rock music critic Robert Hilburn, who detested Tull).<br />The album starts off in great fashion with the album's title track. War shelter sound effects plus a husband and wife talking and sipping tea and the music starts slow but is a great rocker. Another rocker comes on with Queen and Country which wouldn't have sounded out of place on either Aqualung or Benefit. Next is the acoustic number Ladies which includes hand claps, flute and orchestra arrangements. Next is another great number Back-Door Angels which is another great Tull number. The album's first side ended with the comedic rocker Sea Lion which is a great song. The second half of the album begins with the album's most famous acoustic track, the very beautiful Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of The New Day which is a rock radio staple today. That track was one of three songs which was recorded for TAAB's intended follow-up in France before being scrapped in favor of APP. Next is Tull's most famous song aside Aqualung which is Bungle in the Jungle which became Jethro Tull's biggest hit here in the US and another rock radio staple. This track, like the one before it, was another out-take from the France sessions. Only Solitaire is next and was the last France outtake and a short acoustic number which is excellent. We follow with The Third Hoorah which is another great number which has a reprise of the title track. The album's closer Two Fingers, is a new arrangement of the Aqualung outtake Lick Your Fingers Clean and a great rocker to finish the album.<br />Warchild peaked at #2 on the Billboard album charts and was another million seller for the band.<br />In 2002, a digitally remastered CD version was released and has seven bonus tracks. Warchild Waltz is a instrumental version of the title cut. Quartet is another great instrumental. Paradise Steakhouse is next and a great number. Sea Lion 2 has lyrics from Jeffrey Hammond but is a great reprise to part one. Rainbow Blues, Glory Row and Saturation round out this remaster and are great songs. Also included is a booklet containing assorted outtake pictures from the album art sessions plus lyrics and notes written by Ian himself.<br />RECOMMENDED!On The Thin Ice Of The New Day which is a rock radio staple today.

B000069HJN|5.0|Supertramp's eighth studio album Brother Where You Bound was released in May of 1985.<br />The album was the group's first without original singer/guitarist/keyboard player/songwriter/co-founder Roger Hodgson whom left Supertramp in September of 1983 at the conclusion of the ...Famous Last Words... tour. As a result, singer/songwriter/keyboard player/co-founder Rick Davies was the only original member from the very first Supertramp album from 1970 left.<br />This album captures the now four-piece band (for the first time since the 1970 self-titled debut album) at the start of a new era, led by Davies and rounded out by veteran members bass player Dougie Thomson, sax player and occasional keyboard player John Helliwell and drummer Bob Siebenberg with help on the first half by session guitarist Marty Walsh.<br />Bravely discarding the advice and obvious perferences of their critics, they created a masterpiece.<br />From track one, Supertramp grabs your attention with the gripping, lovelorn suite \\"Cannonball\\" which was a Top 30 hit peaking at #26. The track was a classic all in the key of G minor about a betrayal of trust and not a swipe at Hodgson quitting the group. From there, the band continues with \\"Still in Love\\", which is kind of a sequel to 1982's \\"My Kind of Lady\\" but not a re-make of the Famous Last Words track. The mysteriously poignant \\"No Inbetween\\" is next and a great song. The first half ends with the optimistic \\"Better Days\\". The former with its piano work and the latter with its driving beat and use of voices of the candidates from the 1984 US Presidential Campaign during the ending sax solo (including the winner Ronald Reagan and his VP (the elder) George Bush and loser Walter Mondale and VP Geraldine Ferraro (years before Sarah Palin attempted to try VP role)).<br />The second half is dominated by the 16 and a half minute title track which is one of the band's most accomplished and intriguing songs. The track features ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist Scott Gorman (whom was also Bob Siebenberg's brother in law at the time) on rhythm guitars here and Pink Floyd's David Gilmour playing the soaring guitar solos (Gilmour flew to L.A. from London to record his parts as part of a pit stop to his appearance on an MTV concert called Guitar Greats which was filmed at time of recording of this album). The ending solo with Gilmour playing with Supertramp is worth purchasing the album alone. His guitar tone on this track would not have sounded out of place on either any Pink Floyd album or any of his solo albums. The album closes with the optimistic glimmers of \\"Ever Open Door\\" with just Rick and his keyboards (piano and synthesizers).<br />Unfortunately, the public turned its back after this promising set. Brother Where You Bound was Supertramp's last album to enter the top 40 peaking at #21 and going Gold in US sales but subsequent releases failed miserably.

The ending solo with Gilmour playing with Supertramp is worth purchasing the album alone. His guitar tone on this track would not have sounded out of place on either any Pink Floyd album or any of his solo albums. The album closes with the optimistic glimmers of \\"Ever Open Door\\" with just Rick and his keyboards (piano and synthesizers).   Unfortunately, the public turned its back after this promising set. Brother Where You Bound was Supertramp's last album to enter the top 40 peaking at #21 and going Gold in US sales but subsequent releases failed miserably.

B00000AOUD|5.0|English progressive rockers Jethro Tull's fifth album entitled Thick as a Brick was released in May of 1972.<br />The year 1972 was arguably the peak of the \\"so-called\\" progressive rock movement. It was in that year that The Moody Blues hit #1 with Seventh Sojourn. Emerson Lake and Palmer struck twice first with Pictures At an Exhibition that January and then Trilogy that August. Yes then struck twice in 1972 first with Fragile that January and then Close to the Edge that October. Genesis had their first UK Top 20 album with Foxtrot that fall and performed their first ever gigs in the US. Lastly, Pink Floyd released their first US Top 50 album Obscured by Clouds (the soundtrack to the French movie La Vallee) that June and recorded and performed their masterpiece The Dark Side of the Moon (which would come out in 1973).<br />It was also in 1972 that Jethro Tull released the long awaited follow-up to their first US Top 10 album Aqualung entitled Thick as a Brick complete in a 12-page spoof newspaper, including (amongst other things), a poem by child prodigy Gerald Bostock. How Thick as a Brick came to be was that critics had lauded Aqualung a concept album much to singer/songwriter/flute player Ian Anderson's chagrin.<br />Then in an unprecedented move, Anderson plus guitarist Martin Barre, bass player Jeffrey Hammond, keyboard player John Evan and new drummer Barriemore Barlow decided to do a concept album to silence the critics.<br />The album Thick as a Brick contains only one song! One 43 plus minute long song that is. With a myriad of movements and musical pieces, Thick as a Brick is filled with flute, organ, guitar, drum and percussion solos, tempo changes and wild lyrics that the MTV, Green Day, hip hop, R&B, Beyonce and Britney loving crowds cannot nor will they ever appreciate. Music for art's sake!<br />Also, Thick as a Brick's premise was a send-up of the epic length pieces and concept albums that ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Yes were creating at that point just like the movies Airplane was to Airport, Repossessed was to The Exorcist, Scary Movie was to Scream and so on. People fail to realize that progressive rock wasn't all serious as Jethro Tull were known to have fun with their music and concert presentations and had a larger than life sense of humor (they walked on stage on the 1972 tour dressed in bunny rabbit suits (an idea The Flaming Lips would RIP OFF years later)).<br />Thiick as a Brick was the album that made me like Tull after hearing an episode of In the Studio with Redbeard which spotlighted the creation of this masterpiece and the things that went into making this album.<br />The idea on spoofing traditional concept albums worked as Thick as a Brick became Jethro Tull's first album to hit #1 here in the US and sold millions to date.<br />In 1997, the Thick as a Brick album was re-released as a digitally remastered CD with a bonus live version of Thick as a Brick in an 11 minute edited form from the band's 1978 performance at Madison Square Garden from the Bursting Out tour. Also, you get a new interview with former member Hammond and Tull mainstays Barre and Anderson about the creation of this classic album.<br />Thick as a Brick is HUGELY RECOMMENDED!movies Airplane was to Airport, Repossessed was to The Exorcist, Scary Movie was to Scream and so on.

B00008G9JM|5.0|Jethro Tull's sixth studio album entitled A Passion Play was released in July of 1973.<br />1973 was seen as the peak of prog commercially as Emerson Lake and Palmer released Brain Salad Surgery, Genesis gave us Genesis Live 1973 and Selling England By the Pound (the latter was the first Genesis album to hit the US Top 100 peaking at #74), Yes gave us both the classic Top 20 triple live Yessongs and the derided Top 10 album Tales From Topographic Oceans (which was not released in the US until January of 1974) and Pink Floyd unleashed their classic contribution to rock history Dark Side of the Moon.<br />Also that year, Jethro Tull gave us A Passion Play. The album came to be by accident. You see, initially they were to record an album full of shorter songs at Chateau D'Herouville in France but the band was not happy with the sound so the aborted the sessions (three of those tracks would appear on 1974's War Child whilst the rest of the album would emerge as disc one of the rarities set Nightcap).<br />Then lead singer/songwriter/flute player Ian Anderson, guitarist Martin Barre, keyboard player John Evan, bass player Jeffrey Hammond and drummer Barriemore Barlow went to Morgan Studios in London to begin work on the proper follow-up to their 1972 album Thick As a Brick (which consisted of ONE 43 minue song which was split into two halves to accomodate the vinyl record format).<br />Like TAAB, A Passion Play was an album length song but unlike its predecessor was mainly a dark album with some humor (or as the British call it \\"light and shade\\") throughout.<br />The album was the jazziest in musical terms that Tull had recorded up until 1973. The piece was more of a jazzy hard rock than its predecessor. The album saw Ian Anderson utilize more saxophones to his arsenal of instruments (in addition to his usual flute and acoustic guitar and had used some saxophones on Thick as a Brick). Also, John Evan added more synthesizers to the mix. There are plenty of great musical and lyrical passages. The lyrics were some of the darkest Ian Anderson had written to date save for the song's middle section.<br />The section in particular is called The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles. This is hilarious, especially if you watch the accompanying film on the enhanced part of the CD and/or the concert footage. All I can think of when I hear this is a lost Looney Tunes cartoon with Monty Python-esque humor.<br />Then the rest of the piece is just as good, if not better, than the first half.<br />A Passion Play, like TAAB, hit #1 on the Billboard album chart. However, its success was short-lived as opposed to TAAB (and even Aqualung and successors War Child, Minstrel in the Gallery, Songs From the Wood and even Crest of a Knave) and was what led the way for punk to become the rage according to rock critics in the mid-1970s (although punk would not hit commercial popularity here in the US until the 1990s, long after critics raved about it).<br />In 2003, the album was re-released as a remastered CD and sounds excellent.<br />RECOMMENDED!ages.

B00006JKOM|5.0|English art rockers Jethro Tull's ninth studio album Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll Too Young To Die was released in May of 1976 here in the US and in April, 1976 in the UK.<br />The album is seen as the \\"dark horse\\" of the Tull catalog. Some fans loved it and some hated it. I tend to fall in the \\"LOVE IT\\" category.<br />The album was the band's first album with new bass player John Glascock (whom replaced Jeffrey Hammond who retired after 1975's Minstrel In the Gallery). Glascock joined Tull mastermind/singer/songwriter/flute player Ian Anderson, guitarist Martin Barre, drummer Barriemore Barlow and keyboard player John Evan in time to record an album to a proposed musical which Ian decided not to pursue in the end. The album is a concept album (as illustrated in the cartoon in the album's gatefold) about a rock star named Ray whose career went into obscurity and tried to fit in to society only for his career to resurrect at album's end. This theme is still relevant today as many from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s generations are trying to feel young again by listening to classic rock, old school metal and grunge on the radio. I'm already trapped in the 1970s considering I am soon to be 32!<br />We open the album to a teaser intro of the album's title cut which then gives way into the superb rocker \\"Quizz Kid\\" which features excellent guitar work from Barre and has our hero Ray becoming a game show winner. Next is another great rocker \\"Crazed Institution\\" which tells the tale of the glam rock types whom were now the rage. The musicianship is excellent on this track (and the rest of the album is as well). Next is the intricate acoustic guitar number called \\"Salamander\\" which is a great piece about a girl that Ray meets. Next is the great bluesy-rocker \\"Taxi Grab\\" which is about Ray and his girl he met in the taxi. The track has some tasty guitar work by Barre and harmonica work and vocals by Anderson. Barre and Glascock play here like they were on fire. We end the first half with the ballad \\"From a Dead Beat To An Old Greaser\\" with excellent multi-tracked harmonies by Anderson and an excellent sax solo by David Palmer (who would become Tull's second keyboard player and sax player in time for this album's tour) and guitar solo by Barre. This is about Ray and a fellow old greaser who meet at a pub whilst Ray waits for his date.<br />The second half kicks off with the acoustic \\"Bad Eyed and Loveless\\" which describes Ray's anger for being stood up. We follow with the great rocker \\"Big Dipper\\" which has a very infectious beat supplied by barlow and a superb flute riff by Anderson mimicked by Evan and Barre. Next is the album's title cut which is the album's most famous track and a great piece and tells of Ray's motorcycle ride and crash. Next is the superb \\"Pied Piper\\" which has Ray emerging from his coma to find out he is in popularity again. We end the album with the beautiful \\"The Chequered Flag (Dead Or Alive)\\". This piece is probably the best Tull album closer and Ray seeing that his life is back on the upswing again.<br />Too Old to Rock n Roll: Too Young to Die initially reached #14 on the Billboard album charts in 1976 (making it Tull's lowest chart appearance on the US album charts since 1969's Stand Up). Also, this is the only 1970s era Tull album not to be certified Gold. However, the material has withstood the test of time unlike many albums from 1976 (no one remembers neither The Starland Vocal band nor Vickie Sue Robinson nor Andrea True Connection in 2008).<br />In 2002, this underrated gem was remastered and re-released with TWO bonus tracks. First is the acoustic \\"A Small Cigar\\" which is hilarious but great. \\"Strip Cartoon\\" is also a great track as well.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ballad \\"From a Dead Beat To An Old Greaser\\" with excellent multi-tracked harmonies by Anderson and an excellent sax solo by David Palmer (who would become Tull's second keyboard player and sax player in time for this album's tour) and guitar solo by Barre.

B000PKG7TI|5.0|Oh gosh, I don't even know where to start. I rushed to my PC to write this review the very moment this amazing concert ended. It didn't actually end since I started it from the beginning, and now it is being playing in the background while I am writing this review. For some reason, the copy I grabbed yesterday in a local music store doesn't contain CDs, it is just a single DVD version, but I'll find the 2CD/DVD version soon to listen to it in my car.   People could say a million good words about this DVD, but it still doesn't cover an amazing concert which looks and sounds great. My only concern is that DTS 5.1 Surround mix would be a huge plus and a nice addition to 5.1 Dolby Surround and PCM mixes. OK, it looks like bad (fast) editing has ruined many good concert DVDs (Evanescence's Paris show, for instance). In this one, it obviously applies only to the end of the performance, whereas the majority of the show had been editted very nice, and camera moves in more than 2 seconds intervals which doesn't give you a headache.  About track listing. Standouts in my opinion are Wishmaster, Nemo, Sleeping Sun and my absolute favorite Ever Dream. The latter two songs are actually giving me a goose bumps every time I listen to them. The cover of Pink Floyd's High Hopes is actually very good. The cover of Webber's Phantom of the Opera is outstanding. Tarja's voice is incredible and in garmony with a heavy metal they are playing. Basically, her voice is a part of their music. Emppu's guitar solos are just blowing me away. Sometimes I even think that this guy is a better guitar player than Yngwie Malmsteen. The one thing is for sure - the Scandinavian school of the solo guitar is somewhat a fenomenon.  The funny thing is before yesterday I didn't even know this band exists. OK, now I will catch up. I obviously missed a couple of their DVD concerts (based on the amazon's listing). Recommendations? Go and grab yourself a copy of End Of An Era DVD, especially now when US releasedthis concert in region 1, NTSC, so it is playable on any american DVD player. I do highly recommend this concert for those who likes Evanescence, and for every music buff. You will be hooked to it for the rest of your life.
B000O1799U|3.0|This movie starts out strong but, becomes tiresome in the middle. Hudson is pretty good considering but, I don't think her performance is Oscar worthy. When I think of all the performances over the years that got snubbed at the Oscars, it's a crime to see this young lady walk away with an Oscar for just a \\"good\\" performance. Dustin Hoffman \\"Toosie\\", Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Robert De Niro \\"Flawless\\", Richard Harris and Robert Duvall \\"Wrestling Earnest Hemingway\\" even Sean Penn in \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" oh well, the list goes on and on. It's an OK story that has been done before better. Even though Hudson's vocals are good, they are not show stopping! Rent it don't buy it. 2 1/2 Stars.
0440238609|1.0|I am an educator and a Christian.  I ordered and read the books with an open mind.  They are very well written and the author has obvious writing talent.  My concern is the subtle way that he attempts to put down the church by making it into a big brother image, the changing of scripture which appears to be quoted from the Bible, and the connection of deamons attached to people to the real life use of Spirit Guides (a demonic practice).  As an educator, I do not often take a stand that children should not read different types of literature with different values and view points.  In the case of the Dark Materials Trilogy, however, I think it is not a set of books that children should read.  The title \\"Dark Materials\\" pretty much explains what I mean.

0743201140|1.0|I bought this book from Amazon and I guess that it was used.  The value of this book is an on-line strenghts assessment that is good for one user only.  I contacted the company and told them I was not able to log on. They told me that the password they gave me was already used and I was not eligible to take the assessment.  They could not help me since I didn't do enough due diligence before buying the book. \\"Buyer beware.\\"    This book has very little information without the on-line assessment and becomes worthless to anyone other than the original purchaser.    I would be very wary about buying anything by marcus buckingham.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but feel compelled to comment on this \\"little picture\\".  I don't know why I knew nothing of this movie before I took a chance and bought the DVD.  It is truly a charming movie that is entertaining for the whole family.  Stardust reminds me of one of my all time favorites - - The Princess Bride. The stories are not the same, but the \\"feel\\" and tone of the movie are similar.  My kids watched it with me and were totally pulled into the world.  They did get a little scared during the witches scenes, but held on for the rest of the ride.      I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter series or even moreso for fans of The Princess Bride.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|The date: September 6, 1986. The setting: Barbra Streisand's backyard in Malibu. This concert was held by Barbra at her home. It was to raise money so that Democrats could take back control of the Senate and make things right for the nation, and face the issues that we were very frightened about back then. And yes, twenty years after this show, we seem to be facing these similar situations still. Barbra looked absolutely beautiful from beginning to end in this program. It never occurred to me (or anyone else) that this concert (and her other specials) would become available on DVD. Before this show came to DVD, people had to buy it in music format (LP, cassette, and CD). But now, it is here on DVD for fans of Barbra to enjoy. Barbra sings some of her most well loved songs, such as Evergreen, The Way We Were, People, and a number of others. Barry Gibb shows up later on and shares the stage with her to duet on Guilty and What Kind of Fool (here's a trivia tidbit for you: When Barbra was doing One Voice, it had been six years since she and Barry sang these two songs together--be sure to check out her startled reaction to Barry's voice while singing Guilty; that's funny). That was interesting. Before the show begins, Robin Williams gives the audience a comedy show (Camp Barbra). You also get responses from a few celebrities regarding Barbra doing this concert. Bette Midler, Henry Winkler, Whitney Houston, Sally Field, Sheena Easton, and Rep. Barbara Jordan give their positive thoughts regarding this evening and know that it would be an evening no one would forget. There are a couple of extra bonuses to this DVD:  1. You get a 2006 introduction by Barbra, in which she describes in retrospect that evening and her reason for holding the concert. She also discusses the issues that we're currently facing over twenty years later.  2. There is an audio invitation by her before the show (from '86, of course).   The audio and video quality on this DVD is so sharp and clear, youalmost get the feeling that you've gone back in time to 1986 watching this program. A must have for any Barbra fan's collection. If you own One Voice on any one of the music formats (LP, tape, and/or CD), but don't yet have the DVD of it, what are you waiting for?

B000W4D27C|5.0|I've seen The Ocean compared to Neurosis and Isis, but I think such comparisons are indicative of lazy thought as The Ocean have their own sound. This is a great two-cd release that fans of atmospheric, heavy, progressive music will likely enjoy.    In addition to the two albums available on Amazon, I picked up a CD called Fluxion by the Ocean, which is amazing, from Amoeba Records in San Fracnisco. If you like the Aeolian and Precambrian it is more than worth the effort to find Fluxion.
0385611463|5.0|A friend of mine happened upon this book through Amazon's recommendations to other books, read it and told me I must read it.  I went in completely blind and was literally blown away!  WHAT AN AMAZING BOOK!  I have bought 18 more copies of this book to give away to other people to read.  Each one has come back with the same amazing reaction.  This book need to be publicized more for the \\"young adult\\" audience, as well as the \\"older\\" adult audience.  I believe this is a treasure that is being hidden away and may be embarrassing for \\"adults\\" to read.  NOT SO!!

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I love music, but I'm not a \\"word guy\\".  Words and voice must be musical in addition to their meaning.  Too many singers don't understand this as well as they should.  Most of the singers on this album seem to understand that their voice is not just for recitation of the lyrics but is an instrument - and they excel at it.  This is truly a wonderful album to listen to and I just never tire of it.       Ray has obviously mastered his craft and it shows in this album.  You can clearly hear him mentoring Norah Jones in \\"Here We Go Again\\" and hear the pride in his voice when she rises to his standards.  And Billy Preston and his Hammond B3 is so important there that it's almost a trio rather than a duet.     You can hear the give and take as he nudges Elton John out of his usual style and the delight when it works.  The synergy with BB King is that of two old friends in a tight game of rummy - each with his own style and each knowing the others so well that neither wins or loses and both are happier for it.  Bonnie Raitt seems to carry \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?\\" with Ray just along for a ride, but it works perfectly.     There is so much music here and so much pride and so much joy.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
B000O77SRC|4.0|I was in college when the first Die Hard movie was released.  I watched it in a packed theater in Los Angeles with a raucous crowd shortly after its opening.  The crowd had a great time, laughing in all of the obligatory spots where laugh lines are intentionally placed.  However, walking out of the theater, I could not help but feel that I had watched something other than a run-of-the-mill action movie.  What struck me most was the intriguing bad guy, Hans Gruber, played brilliantly by then-unknown actor Alan Rickman.    Hans presented a refreshingly complex and out-of-the-ordinary villain for the audience to savor, what with his off-the-cuff masquerading as an escaped hostage when surprised by protagonist John McClane (Bruce Willis) and his fake-out of the LAPD and FBI into believing that he and his gang were international terrorists making various \\"release our imprisoned colleagues\\" demands when they were actually just bent on robbing the Nakatomi Corporation--culminating in one of my absolute favorite lines in movie history when in response to Holly Genero/McClane's (Bonnie Bedelia) declaration that despite all of the grandiose talk and build-up, Hans is actually nothing but a common thief, he responds with gusto, \\"I am an EXCEPTIONAL thief!  And, considering that I'm moving up to kidnapping, I'd be a little more polite if I were you, Mrs. McClane!\\"    The sparring between Hans and McClane is amusing and drama-building--while the physical stuff is reserved for McClane's encounters with one of Hans's muscular henchmen, played by Alexander Gudenov.  The touching account of why the donut-eating LAPD officer \\"Al\\" (played with heart by Reginald Veljohnson) adds a very human side to the film, as well as a subtle reminder of just how tough it is to be a cop.  All of this along with very offbeat touches (such as the advice that McClane receives aboard his flight to L.A. to remove his shoes and sink his feet into the carpet to unwind from a long trip--leaving him barefootthroughout his battles with Hans and his gang) make this a far-from-ordinary action movie.    Viewers will also be amused by the script's jabs at the FBI and the news media.  While it is common practice in movies and on TV to take swipes at the FBI's overzealousness in pulling rank on local police forces, as well as the news media's lack of scruples in trying to get the scoop on a hot story, both are played for tension-releasing laughs in a very fresh-feeling manner that flows well with the rest of the story.    I was surprised during a recent lunchtime discussion to learn that some of my younger co-workers (in their 20s and into their early 30s) have never watched the original Die Hard.  I tried explaining to them that none of the overly stunt- and special effects-dependent sequels compare to the original, whose strength was built on character development, quirky twists to the tale, and a slow but steady pattern of dramatic and psychological build-up, with a few occasional small releases of tension along the way, culminating in the final resolution.  Director John McTiernan's pacing and sprinkling of humor throughout the movie are what make Die Hard a memorable film.
0743486285|5.0|Excellent book, hard to put down. Unlike the many books of \\"I was an addict and here's how I got clean\\", this book takes the \\"I am an addict and here's how I got messed up\\" approach. A lot of foul language, adult situations as you can guess, definitely not a book that just anyone would enjoy.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Despite the fact that Bruce Willis is the same character is ALL his film-we return to the main one that made him infamous in the late 80's and the same formula still works.  When we first meet John having an argument with his daughter, I'm instantly reminded of the similuarity of the scene of that of The Last Boy Scout.  How McClaine is still just some cop and not the mayor or some high ranking politician with his record of heroics is amazing within itself or heck, let's send him to the middle east and let him win the war for us.  The man should be able to win the thing within 24 hours.  My point is NOTHING is believable in this and at least 3 of the films in this franchise-BUT damn if you can turn away from it.  There is something about Bruce that speaks to the hero in all of us.  We want to be that bad MF who has a sarcastic quip for every and all situations. McClaine is like Cher and cockroaches, you can't get rid of him and he damn sure won't go away.  Overall, this series still has what it takes to thrill you.  Come on movie number 5.

B000E33W1W|4.0|Originally Amazon's computerized and alphabetical listing of the actors claimed that \\"Ghostbusters\\" starred William Atherton and Timothy Carhart, and featured Jodran Charney, Joe Crillo, and Alice Drummond.  However, as time has gone on, they've corrected that misleading listing.     \\"Ghostbusters,\\" of course, stars Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver.  It's a fun, silly comedy, and I especially enjoy Bill Murray and Rick Moranis and the gorgeous Sigourney Weaver, who looks great in the film and is appealing as \\"regular girl friend material,\\" until she becomes possessed by the evil spirit \\"Zuul,\\" in which sections she is very funny.  (And her behavior causes Murray to say, \\"Oh, Zuul, you nut.\\"        Anyway, a fun movie.
B000WMEAKC|4.0|The song \\"Too Late To Apologize\\" is the hit song on the CD, but the other songs are worthy of carrying the CD. The other songs have their own pace and style unique to the CD. They carry their own weight and are very good.  Excellent CD and worth buying.
0393061310|5.0|I loved this book. I have read it at least three or four times, and each time I discover something new that I missed the first time. Diamond's way of making the people in history come alive made me love history in a way I haven't since my undergrad years. Whatever those boring lectures in college killed, this book resurrected. His thesis is very well supported, and I enjoyed checking out some of the books in his endnotes.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is NOT a cartoon. There is real depth here. The overarching theme is suvival in a post-apocalyptic world. This apocalypse was precipitated by the hubris of prior generations. As the story unfolds we see that the goodness of the title character is the cure for the past ills.   I first rented this film from NetFlix, primarily based on the strength of other films by Miyazaki. These movies are anime but the background illustration is fine art quality. Distributed by Disney, Disney wishes they could find such compelling story lines and flawless cell-based animation. However, hats off to Disney (and John Lassiter) for bringing this to life in the english-speaking market. Also hats off to the voice actors for bringing emotion and reaity to the characters from a sound booth and in perfect pace to such a foriegn language.  I'm almost 50 and I've been a student of animation all my life. I watched this 7 or 8 times in a row and picked out new layers each time. My 6 year old daughter was just as entranced as I. (I secretly want her to grow up to be just like Nausicaa.)  I will be purchasing more Miyazaki to stand up alongside Star Trek and Babylon 5.
B000RG1FMO|3.0|Kanye's third album \\"Graduation\\" has really summoned they hype around this album, especially since it was released the same day as 50 Cent's [[ASIN:B000QUCPUC Curtis]] deciding who is going to sell more. With Kanye dropping this album, I have to say it's not as good as his previous. The production is there like it's always been, but the lyrics have been declining. Kanye really doesn't offer much behind the rhymes. Especially when he talks about his clothes, it really runs dry (\\"I'm like a fly Malcom-X bot, By Any Jeans Necessary...\\"). Other than that, this album is enjoyable for the most part.<br /><br />To me some of the best tracks are towards the end. Two of my favorites are \\"Homecomming\\" his ode to his hometown Chicago with Chris Martin, and \\"Bittersweet\\" with John Mayer (on the UK version). \\"Flashing Lights\\" is another great standout on the album, especially with it's production. \\"Good Life\\" which was one of the singles from this album, with T-Pain (who sounds okay), presuaded me to purchase this album. DJ Premier (whos managing to stay buzy) does what he does best with those records, scratching samples on \\"Everything I Am\\". Ending this album  Kanye dedicates \\"Big Brother\\" to his other mentor Jay-Z.<br /><br />What lowers this album is a bunch of songs that go flat. Songs like \\"Drunk & Hot Girls\\" goes absolutely nowhere. \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" (both origonal and remix with Young Jeezy) goes absolutely nowhere. \\"Barry Bonds\\" makes absolutely no sense (with Lil' Wayne as usual).<br /><br />Overall, Graduation is a solid album. Fans of maninstream music or those who don't often listen to rap may like this one. To me, I believe that [[ASIN:B0009WPKY0 Late Registration]] is his best album. This LP does have a few bangers on here, but the overall album is okay. Kanye might need to tighten his lyrics us on his next go around if he wants to drop another superior album.

B000002G87|5.0|The following is a copy of the manuscript of a lecture I gave at the Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles on October 21, 1995. I am hopeful that this will convince people that I am a very serious Seer about music and just not some phantasm they created after a bad nights sleep.....<br /><br />\\"Good evening people - are you ready to rock and roll with Metamorpho? (loud applause). Yes yes, I can see all of you are here to hear about Clapton. Mr. Eric Clapton - you all know him, don't you? (fanatic cheers). OK Now, listen closely people and you might just learn something - then again, probably not (loud laughter and applause). Let's see now, where did I put my notes? (peers up his sleeve and finds nothing-then tries the other sleeve and produces a stratocaster). That Clapton - I told him not to leave his guitar at my place unless he axes me! (some laughter but mostly boos and hisses over a very bad joke). OK Ok, let's get to the topic of the evening, shall we? (cheers). We are here to discuss Mr. Clapton's masterpiece entitled \\"Layla\\". And no people, she is not the one who broke up the Beatles, so put that thought out of your heads (smiles sheepishly thinking he's scored points when, in reality, nobody heard it because the mike cut out). OK now. Way back when, Mr. Clapton, who gained alot of fame by being in alot of groups, decided that he would finally branch out on his own and create this classic recording. What can we say people? This recording, in itself, is the culmination of many years fine tuning his craft and taking part in many ventures. Unfortunately, Mr. Clapton gave the Dominos a short time of investment. There have been studies to suggest that he had ADD - but nothing has been proved (beams with self-absorbed knowledge). OK now - why is \\"Layla\\" so special? Well, at the time, Mr. Clapton was absorbed by love for Patti Boyd, who was George Harrison's wife. This situation produced alot of inner turmoil and a way of dealing with these emotions was to invest all his energy into this recording. Mind you, he aquired alot of fine, top-notch musicians such as Bobby Whitlock (piano, guitar), Carl Radle (bass) and Jim Gordon (drums, percussion). All of them excellent and well-versed in the rock/blues arena. They all shine on gems such as \\"I Looked Away\\",\\"Keep On Growing\\", and the eternally great Clapton composition \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\". And, believe me people, if Eric had continued with that format it would have been a very good album. That, however, was not the case. Instead, he decided to invite Duane Allman over to play on the recordings, and with that little inclusion he produced a classic album. (clapping). Why you may ask? Well, I will tell you but don't forget the donation ushers at the egress! (much laughter). Duane was a top notch guitarist and more than capable of giving Eric a run for his money on guitar. Duane, if you will, pushed Eric into a higher stratosphere, making him excel. And they both fed off the energy that the other would produce. This created a spiral effect which comes across so clearly. Examples would be \\"Anyday\\" (a magikal whirlwind of slide guitar), \\"Little Wing\\" (an awesome take on the Hendrix song) and, of course the sonic riffs on \\"Layla\\". Duane's contibutions cannot be discounted. No. He brings with him the smokey, gritty southern rock sound and infuses it into Eric's English-blues acumen. This produces an awesome hybrid, especially on the blues numbers such as \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\", \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman?\\", and \\"Key to the Highway\\". And people, people! (sees people talking in front row and peers at them), alot of the reason why these blues are so effective is because they are born out of Eric's pain. You could consider this recording as a therapy and Duane, in some metamorphic way, the therapist he needed at the time. Oh, I see some of you scoff at this (hears giggles). Perhaps I should have worn my clown outfit? Bet you'd listen then! (crowd laughs with appreciation). Yes, yes....that's more like it.<br />In conclusion, you have to look at \\"Layla\\" as a classic for all the reasons I told you - but also because of the variety they included here. You certainly have the rockers and the blues, but also the tender acoustic \\"Thorn Tree in the Garden\\" and the wispful meter of \\"I Am Yours\\". All selections masterfully done. (crowd cheers).<br />And so my people, please get this right away. It belongs in any serious rock collection. I do hope you enjoyed it! (crowd stands and loud cheering and applause are THUNDEROUS!). Thank-you people, thank-you people. I am reluctant to take your generous appreciation but I will anyway (grins with self satisfaction). Ok people- you know what's next (in the tradition of Metamorpho's closing of a lecture, he takes his Seer Hat off and tosses it into the air- Mary Tyler Moore style). Bye for now (winks and skates off the stage).<br /><br />Well people, hope you enjoyed it. Thanks for being part of the \\"lecture experience\\".<br /><br />Checking the donation box- your own, Metamorpho ;)..that's more like it.

0553278398|3.0|For me, Asimov is the master of science fiction, but the early Asimov tends to deliver better on this than the later one. I've read quite a bit of the Foundation series, Including the Original trilogy and the two sequels to it, and now I've finished Prelude to Foundation. I've also read several of his Robot books, and others as well. I think I am confident in saying that Asimov's early work was certainly his his best, but that his later stuff is still great for an Asimov fan. Much like with Foundation's Edge and Foundation and the Earth, Asimov weaves a brilliant and winding story of character on an important journey. But as with these other two, the ending really fails for me. Especially with this story, there seems to be a touch to much of the  manipulation by greater forces theme.  Still, it is well worth the read, if you are prepared for a similar ending to the Foundation trilogy sequels.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|I am old enough to remember when this incident happen in the mid 70's. It made the national news during the 74-75 UFO flap across america. The film captures the mid 70's time period well. The end of the movie with the spaceship scenes, while entertaining, I take with a grain of salt.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|The packaging alone is enough to justify the addition of this set to your already complete The O.C. Collection, it's simply stunning and unexpected with the acryllic case safely guarding your most precious dvd set.  The book design is just about the coolest design I've seen in a long time (I know about the Sex and the City set but I never got any hands-on experience with it). Haven't really had the time to check out the extras yet but the pictures and stories written in the book are a (too small) goldmine for any fan.  Vertict: There is no reason not to buy this if you don't already own the previous sets and even if you do, try to dump those old sets on craigslist for free, this is just too sexy to pass on.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|Getting the footage from Live Aid is worth the price of this.  I was awestruck by the performance.  They crammed the intensity of a full show into 25 minutes.  The live at montreal performance is pretty good as well.  Not as good as Live at Wembley, but near that.  If you are a Queen fan, buy this.  If you are old enough to remember Live Aid (I was 12), buy this.  This is a great DVD from a phenomenal band.
B000WQWPJQ|3.0|I own movies in both HD DVD and Blu-Ray formats so I've seen very many HD movies and am well familiar with the formats capabilities.    Being one of my favorite movies, Cast Away's release in Hi-Def got me very excited. I'm a big fan of the movie and give the movie itself 5 stars but am only reviewing the quality of this release here. The opening sequence where the FedEx truck drives up and picks up the package for delivery to Russia looks only slightly better than the standard DVD. When the truck opens up and the Russia scene starts it looks a lot better, but still more like 720p quality. Through the rest of the movie the HD quality stays about the same, decent but not great. It's certainly a step up from DVD but there are a few scenes that seem to be no better than my 2 disc DVD edition. The best looking scenes are the closeup scenes where the HD quality becomes more apparent but it still doesn't look anywhere near as good as other HD titles I own. Some of the best looking HD titles I own are: The Matrix collection, 2001, The Fifth Element, Apollo 13, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Pirates of the Caribbean, and number of others.    While watching the movie and examining the quality I came to the thought that it might not be the transfer that's the issue but possibly it was the director of photography's filming. It looks like the DP tried hard to keep a balance of focus between the actor and the background thereby not getting a truly sharp focus. I could be wrong but this is what it looked like. The 5.1 surround sound was fantastic. I didn't notice any difference between my DVD and Blu-ray versions, though I do admit I really didn't examine the audio.    Overall the movie was nice but I was let down as I was expecting better, especially from a movie with such a great environment. If you own the 2 disc DVD keep in mind the 2 disc set has all those extras and this hi-def release does not. So you may want to hold onto your set. Don't go getting Cast Away expecting the same HD quality you see in all those top notch movies that people use to showcase the format. It still looks great and certainly better than DVD just not leaps and bounds better for most of the scenes. Again, I can't say for sure but it may simply have been the way it was filmed.    Viewed on:  Sony PS3 (latest update)  Samsung LN-T5265F 52\\" LCD 1080P (calibrated)  Toshiba 5.1 surround sound system
B00009P1O2|5.0|Wow...sorry, can't seem to come up with anything more descriptive.  I think the only time Queen was better than this was at Live Aid.  Die Hard Queen fans will posolutely absotively love this.  Less die hard fans may not like it tho.  Regardless, this is the near pinnacle of Queen.
B000Z0OX9O|1.0|As some of the others have stated, this is NOT the Blade Runner soundtrack.  It may be new Vangelis music, it may even be 'inspired' by Blade Runner but some of the great music from the film just isn't there.  Where is Ogi No Mato (the blimp music) and the music from Tyrell's place where Deckard first meets Rachel?  Where is the music from Taffy Lewis' place? The titles are there but the music isn't even close. I'm not saying the new music is bad, it's just not Blade Runner.  Fans looking for the proper soundtrack best stick with the bootleg versions...sadly.
B00000IP2L|5.0|Having produced 7 albums for the last 8 years, I consider the BLS's first output \\"Sonic Brew\\" as the best work, mainly because of the band's (Zakk's) fresh creativity at that time.  Considering that this album was made of a pile of ideas that Zakk had in his mind since the release of \\"Pride & Glory\\" and \\"Book of Shadow,\\" outcomes should be a constellation of the heuristic music, which became \\"Sonic Brew.\\"<br /><br />Some reviews are likely to criticize the distorted over-drive bass contained in the recording for this album, but I like it a lot.  Actually, it seems that the sound level was a little lower at the process of production, which may be done intentionally so as to create the harshness in instrumenation.  For example, the same effects can be found at the Wildhearts' (England's great metal band!) \\"Endless Nameless\\" album. Thus, I need to turn it up louder, every time I blast the CD on stereo.<br /><br />As always, the songwriting is fabulous. Following the line of 90's Zakk's works (this album was also released in the 90's), every song contain some melodic line, which is very catchy at times.  Riffs are brutal as always.<br /><br />Most unique thing at this album is that the song structure is unpredictable, which is a great thing; you cannot expect what comes next even within same tune.  This is primarily why listening 30 secs samples does not give you a justice for judging this album! You need to listen a whole song/album.<br /><br />CD starts with the great beginning (Bored To Tears) and ends the great end (The Beginning... At Last).  I skip \\"No More Tears.\\"<br />By the way, if the band makes a whole thrash album (something like the song \\"The Beginning... At Last\\"), it would be extremely nice!<br /><br />If this CD is not in your catalogue, I highly recommend the inclusion soon or later!
B00005JPAO|3.0|As an American, I have never quite \\"gotten\\" the role that the British Monarchy plays in the government and life of Great Britain. This film went far towards explaining this, as the British establishment reeled after the death of Princess Diana. Tony Blair had just taken up his duties as Prime Minister when this tragedy struck. The nexus of this film is the struggle between Blair and the Queen concerning how the Monarchy should react to Diana's death. The British public demanded that the House of Windsor address the issue publicly, while the Queen implacably sought to keep out of the public eye during this turmoil. The Queen, at least according to this film, initially treated Blair with contempt, but eventually is forced to see that Blair correctly understood what the public demanded of the Monarchy. One interesting line in the film is where the Queen reflects that \\"when a Queen loses touch with her subjects, maybe it is time for her to step aside in favor of a new generation...\\" Now there is food for thought...<br /><br />This film depicts the Queen as a dignified lady, steeped in tradition, who is nevertheless hopelessly out of touch with public opinion and suffering from not a little over-arrogance. Tony Blair forces her to see that the Monarchy, in the end, must serve the people and meet their expectations. In one scene she sits in depression, staring at a newspaper headline \\"Queen Bends the Knee to Blair.\\" Yes, that about summed it up.<br /><br />Helen Mirren absolutely nails the role of the Queen in this film, and Michael Sheen does very well as Tony Blair. All of the supporting actors do well. This is a quality film that successfully captures the turmoil that Diana's death caused for the British Establishment. It is also excellent entertainment.
B0001Z363W|5.0|\\"Hangover Music Vol. VI\\" is another groundbreaking work by the world legendary songwriter/guitarist Zakk Wylde.  Having released four studio albums with Black Label Society prior to this release, his fans were surely reminiscent of the soft side of this brilliant musician, as we have previously witnessed it by his solo works in the 90's.<br /><br />First, let me start by saying that his recent involvement with Black Label Society definitely helped this CD to step up one more direction with respect to his musicianship. Note: this CD was actually released under the name of Black Label Society, although Zakk had mostly contributed to it, from the songwriting to the instrumentation.<br /><br />That said, \\"Hangover Music Vol. VI\\" is in the same lines with \\"Book of Shadows\\" except that the former contains more electronic instrumentation, which actually creates a good coupling of the acoustic and electronic elements.  Unlike \\"Book of Shadows,\\" you can actually hear his infamous guitar routine \\"Wah-Wah,\\" for example at \\"House of Doom,\\" and \\"Queen of Sorrow,\\" which I believe to be very great thing.  Now, he mixed his skills up to generate great music.<br /><br />Another thing that significantly diffentiates \\"Hangover\\" from \\"Book of Shadows\\" is that Zakk rejuvenated his excellent Piano elements at the former work (although he used them for \\"Too Numb to Cry\\", another classic).  As those who are familiar with \\"Pride & Glory,\\" he is in particularly phenomenal when it comes to writing the piano-filled ballads, including \\"Sweet Jesus\\" and \\"Fadin' Away.\\"  At \\"Hangover,\\" the piano instrumentation matches effectively with the band, which is no doubt about it; for example the piano is noticeable at \\"Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow,\\" \\"Damage is Done,\\" and \\"Woman Wont' Cry.\\"<br /><br />Finally, I have to say that my favorite track is actually \\"Whiter Shade Of Pale,\\" originally created/performed by the 60's British band Procol Harum. I like this song, mainly because Zakk sings the best here (at least within this album), almost reminding me how he had sang in the early 90's with Pride & Glory. His vox is extremely beautiful here, along with the magnificent piano.  Also, his selection of this song (from the British progressive band) is enough to indicate the wider range of his music preferences.<br /><br />Without any hesitation, I would recommend the purchase of this masterpiece (and it is relatively cheap at the amazon) if you are still considering the possession.um), almost reminding me how he had sang in the early 90's with Pride & Glory. His vox is extremely beautiful here, along with the magnificent piano.

I'm not even done with it yet, but I had to come on here to see if people found it as annoying as me.  I will finish it, if only because I spent a smucking $9.99 on it.    I've been reading Steven King since Carrie, and I buy each book hopefully, but I have found myself more disappointed than not for the past 10 years.  His books sell because his early stuff was genius, not because his current stuff is even average.  Over-priced and over-hyped; this might be the last one I buy.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|For this album, My Chemical Romance just copies the melodies and song structures on bands such as the Styx and Queen.  Go and compare \\"Come Sail Away\\" by the Styx with \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\".  They are ironically similar.  Even the singing tone is almost an exact replica of the lead singer of Styx.  For several months, I even thought it was the Styx!!!  Being a musician myself, I can appreciate well written music from an original band but when their is nothing original about it, there is not much I can say but SAVE YOUR MONEY!

B00005JPS5|1.0|Has everyone lost their minds these days? Just because this movie was written and voiced by Jerry Seinfeld doesn't mean we have to think this movie would be first of all brilliant and second of all funny. I can confidently say this movie was neither of those. All I found it to be was a bad attempt at comedy with desperate one liners, which strongly resembled the comedy from the last horrible season of Seinfeld's show. But I guess the quality of movie's are slipping but at least the public has once again managed to fill up Seinfeld's {hard to fit anything else in there) wallet. Wake up people this movie was trash!!

Movie = great, everything else = mediocre.
B000Q6GUW0|3.0|Dexter is one of the best TV shows to debut in the last five years.  The writing is fantastic, the characters are well-developed and perfectly portrayed.  I can't say anything bad about the show itself.    The actual DVD set, on the other hand, is horrible.  The menu design is hideous, there's no ability to select chapters from the menu, there are literally no special features beyond the actor/director commentary and a couple of episodes of Brotherhood, which essentially amount to an advertisement for another Showtime DVD set.  Showtime is a network with deep pockets and a well-earned reputation; they should have done a lot better than this.

B000CRQX34|5.0|The Legendary Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It deserves the praise it gets, anyone who says it's stupid needs to let a little hot air out of their heads. Honestly, with out a doubt, this is THE FUNNIEST film I have ever seen, no doubt, the funniest. Why you ask? Well, it is filled to the brim with original and blatantly hysterical humor, that renders the viewer senseless with it's awesome hystericalness. These people aren't afraid to use odd and at times, dumb humor to get their laughs, they don't wimp out, they take all they have and launch it at you, one by one, until the movie abruptly ends. At this point, you need to sit in one position for an hour, calm down, and reflect on what they just saw.    For anybody who likes good jokes of all kinds, this is for you, if you think this kind of humor is worthless, throw yourself down a well, for humanity's sake.

B000W4HJ44|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my daughter for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it and has already learned most of the dances.  Amazon delivered quickly.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book.  It was inspiring and funny.  It was sad and brillant.  If you \\"got it\\", it brought out many emotions and was just a pleasure to read.
B000IOM0X8|5.0|You have most likely already seen the movie so I will only say that it is good. As for Blu-ray PQ is excellent in my opinion (high detail all the way down to the stubble on Mathew's face). I thought that AQ was equally as good at least on my setup (it was clear and put you in the movie).
B000002UAR|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever recorded...along with all the other Beatles later albums....Just Wanted to add another 5 star review to this masterpiece.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B000H7J9RQ Barbra Streisand - One Voice]]    Wonderful DVD.  The best of Barbra, in a remarkable performance.  The only observation: I would like to have subtitles for the songs and for the words.  But, despite this, it´s a five-star album
1878424505|5.0|This book is easy to read and takes a few hours. The wisdom is something we probably all know inside ourselves. I was saying \\"yes, I know that\\" all the way through. It is not simple to put into practice since I have some bad habits but it calls attention to the places where I am out of alignment with myself and others and for that I read the book over and over to keep reminding me of it's truth.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|Down is a band that never disappoints when it comes to agressive, power rock music.  This album is no exception.  As all Down albums have been, the heavy grooves that this recording provide reminds one of Pantera's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" album - powerful, grinding music that makes you want to put your fist through the wall.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|After listening to their stuff on the TV featuring Timberland i was waiting for the release in the UK but couldn't wait.    The rest of the album is as impressive as the song that everyone looks to when they mention one republic.    My view is that the original version of Apologize is the better out of the two.    So all in all this is a fantastic album and looking forward to future albums
0810993139|5.0|I picked this book up after a recommendation from another parent. My 9 yr. old son is a difficult person to choose books for. He is a tad reluctant and needs to be pushed at times. Not in this case. He devoured the book in a week- a record!!!! There were only a couple of words that he didn't know and  I needed to explain the concept of popularity contests to him. He giggled his way through every page, and this evening asked for book number 2- it is a true miracle!!! I read a few sections myself and I can see why he enjoyed it so much- very funny and engaging. We both recommend this book, the cartoons are great and add to the enjoyment- you feel as though you really have picked up someone else's journal- and what is more fun than that?!
B000002LND|5.0|I don't know why but I find the recording for the tracks superb! Somehow, it made every tracks sound so good.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|My fan-furor for Genesis is really based more on their earlier stuff.  Throughout the 80's I continued to listen but was continually disappointed with each new album.  \\"Live Over Europe\\" brings the very best of their pop-popularity-music and presents it in an exciting, energetic, and enjoyable way that even a unenthusiastic fan like myself can enjoy.  Go ahead and get this album....!
B00005JPSA|3.0|Everybody knows the heroic story of Beowulf. I read it many years ago in a modern English version, but you notice the difference between the original poem and this adaptation. Robert Zemeckis-directed film version is actually not about the three battles between Beowulf and Grendel, his mother and Dragon, but about what really happened to the protagonist, who is here described as a more vulnerable and flawed hero. Perhaps writer team Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery (especially the former) could have added more elements, but at least I found the script is pretty good. But of course, you cannot use it as CliffsNote.    But I somehow didn't like the picture itself very much. (Let me add hurriedly that I watched it in a traditional 2-D theater.) Not that the film's actions are unexciting. The actions including flying Dragon and fierce, terrifying, zombie-like Grendel are simply great, but the movements of some characters in some scenes look still very awkward like the ones you see in video games.     I think I know what Robert Zemeckis is trying to prove and the images are improved compared with \\"The Polar Express\\" where Tom Hanks often looked like a frozen undead, but some people would ask themselves why this film, or any other films using techniques such as motion capture for that matter, should be shot like this. Why making some actors' body look fatter than they really are (see Anthony Hopkins for instance), or thinner than they are (Ray Winstone looks like Sean Bean at first sight)? Why not cast Sean Bean instead? Probably time will tell the answer.    The best part is, of course, Angelina Jolie as Grendel's alarmingly sexy mother with a tail, but perhaps you have already know that. But with or without CGI, Angelina Jolie is very sexy and fans have already known that, too.
0156030306|5.0|The book that I have read is called \\"Flowers For Algernon\\". This book is about a boy named Charlie Gordon and, a rat named Algernon. Charlie is mentally ill and, has no friends because of his condition. Algernon is a lab rat who will soon undergo an experiment. Both Charlie, and Algernon will now be guinea pigs to a new surgery a doctor wants to try.      Charlie was disliked by many of his family members. His mother and sister often teased him about his condition, but his father loved him no matter what. Charlie went to a doctor who did a surgery on him ,and the lab rat Algernon. After the surgery Charlie and Algernon both became smart. Charlie did not have his mental condition anymore, and Algernon had the mind of a very smart human.      As time went by both Charlie, and Algernon became friends. Charlie felt good about himself because he was finally smart and he could now prove he was not dumb. People didn't like him even more now that he was smart because Charlie started seeing things and yelling at others because he got that smart.      The book in my opinion is a great book. I would recommend \\"Flowers For Algernon\\". To many diffrent people. I liked this book because its relatable to real life situations. There is alot of emotions and problems that everyone goes through. Charlie was in a tough situation because Algernon finally died and he had no one left.    Xavier
0440241901|5.0|Sophie Kinsella's \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\" is SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL. From word one to the end.<br />Laugh out loud hilarious. Fast and furious pace. Quirky and endearing characters.<br />The lead Emma is a warm and perfectly flawed character:}<br />You will cheer for her, hurt for her and shake you head in bewilderment at her not so bright moves:}<br />Kinsella, has such a gift for pacing. Just when you are laughing uproariously, she throws in an \\"ohmigod that is so true to life moment\\", that she takes your breath away.<br />Emma, has a problem telling people the truth about even the smallest things. She isn't dishonest, she just hates hurting people's feelings. That philosophy eventually backfires spectacularly on her when she meets a stranger on a plane and spills her guts about<br />her secrets, out of nervous fear as the plane experiences technical problems.<br />The man, in one of those curves life throws at you, turns up at her work soon after and from there it is just a great roller-coaster of wonderful-readable story, skilled writing and absopositutely great reading entertainment.<br />I am hooked on author Sophie Kinsella.<br />She is right up there with Susan Elizabeth Phillips and Jennifer Weiner for talented, thoughtful authors, who draw characters you can really care about. The kind for me, I always hope for a sequel as I close the book. Or wish I could have a cup of coffee with them.<br />Don't keep this book or Sophie Kinsella a secret, tell your book buddies about her.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|It is clear from other reviews that this film failed the 'reality' test. According to many, the life depicted in the film does not resemble what is called reality. Curiously, reality is the criterion used to judge this film but not, say, 'Star War' or for that matter about 99% of Hollywood films. Like the director, I have no experience whatsoever of war, but I have a lifetime of film-going under my belt. As a film about film-making and not about war, this movie works. It is often visually stunning. There are numerous strikingly beautiful, stunningly horrid scenes that belong to the art of film and to nothing else. In this regard, it does obviously seek to echo Coppola's masterpiece on Vietnam, which, one should remember, was dismissed by the critics. The acting is quite good. Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Fox are both very strong here. There are some great scenes, although one might very well say that as a whole it doesn't excite. The story arc lacks dramatic momentum. It is episodic. The central plot of a soldier trained to do something that never happens is a problem; this is a kind of existential moment that is hard to dramatize. Waiting is difficult to bring over, yet we know that waiting is one of the crucial elements of what makes war so dreadful. If anything about the picture is real, this would be it, yet this is why the question of whether it is 'real' strikes me as irrelevant. Often to tell a good story one must let the 'real' go in favor of drama. In life, we often suffer from the fact that nothing happens, which is called boredom; in film, boredom is to be avoided at all costs. This is not an entirely successful movie, but it tries hard.
0446577391|4.0|Great story with a continuing cast of charachters from the Camel Club. The story was fast paced, well told and overall I highly recommend it.
B000VZGK3K|5.0|Despite the lack of forestory information, this movie is entertaining. It is very accurate about the life of Howard Hughes. Some fascinating details of his family history is missing along with his Las Vegas acquisitions of casinos and many events that transpired during the latter part of his life (including the loss of Hughes Tool Company). Mr. Hughes strong attraction to have countless movie starlets was never viewed compared to what is documented from reality. This picture touches on his fancination of movie production and aviation which covers the broadest and most interesting facets of Howard Hughes life. It comes highly recommended.
B000002KON|5.0|I believe Ray Davies is a fairly brilliant poet, and I wouldn't argue with any of the  reviews posted here. I would like to point out that his brother Dave 'Death of a Clown' Davies is one amazing guitar player, and that he simply submits a masterpiece in the second half of 'Australia' (after singing the Brian Wilson part in the first half).    I'm not sure this is a better album than Preservation, but, shoot, I can always listen to both.

1592402038|5.0|I wasn't sure what to make of this book when I first saw the title. What did \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" mean? It sounded a little crazy to me. But when I started reading the book I quicky realized it was a gem. It's a book on punctuation, and yet it became a best seller. How is this possible? When you read it you'll see why it happened, and there's no doubt that it deserved the attention. Not only is it well-written, it's humerous, and it does, indeed, give you a lot of good information about punctuation. You might wonder how chapters on the comma, the apostrophe,and the dash could keep your interest, but you only have to start reading the book to see that it is possible. All in all, it's a fun book to read.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Though this is an animated movie, the folks at Pixar and Disney give plenty for adults to enjoy as well.  In addition to the special effects, the subject matter is quite accurate as far as cooking and Paris.  I enjoyed it!
B00005JPTI|3.0|This movie put the right director and star together, but they chose the wrong script.  At one point, this movie had a brilliant script by Mark Protosevich.  Unfortunately they had it reworked by Akiva Goldsman (whose computer is where good scripts go to die) and they lost the chance to make a really good movie.<br /><br />And it is truly the writing that tanks this film.  Will Smith's character has no consistency.  Sometimes he is the calm, levelheaded scientist, and then he is demonstrably insane (talking to mannequins like they are real).  The monsters are similarly inconsistent: we're told and shown that they are subhuman beasts with no conscious intelligence; all they know is their basic urges (hunger, aggression, etc.).  But then the movie has them set a trap that would take a great deal of thought and preparation and knowledge of Smith's character that suggests they had evolved millennia in mere days.  The inconsistency in this script is maddening.<br /><br />On the good side, there are three action sequences in this film that are absolute show-stoppers.  Director Francis Lawrence knows how to build suspense and put you in the action.  One scene in particular -- which I won't spoil by detailing -- was absolutely frightening.<br /><br />For some really odd reason, a religious slant comes into the story right at the end and then becomes an instrumental part of the plot even though it had no involvement previously.  It's just another example of a poorly written script.<br /><br />To call the ending unsatisfying is to let it off easy.  It's one of the worst endings I have literally ever seen.  It is almost like the final reel of the movie is missing.<br /><br />Will Smith does what he can.  And I was impressed by Francis Lawrence's direction.  But the script really ruins a chance for what could have been an entertaining commercial film.  As it exists now, it is a valiant, noble failure of good intentions.
B00005JLD4|3.0|Overall this was a good movie about a disturbing subject.  Although I have no way of knowing if the facts of the movie are consistent with the true events, there was one critical thing that could have made this movie timeless.  What I am suggesting is that a brave director will at some point address the same subject (probably not the same story) with grit and realism.      The problem with the movie:  These girls acoomplished an increadible feat which the movie does not come close to presenting.  However, the three young actors did a great job.  The viewer gets the impression that everyday there was a home or person available along their entire walk to feed them.  I'm guessing this was not the case.  The director needed to provide the viewer with a sense of time and distance traveled which I never felt.  Besides trying to avoid capture, the director gives you the impression that the only hardship occurred during a single day while walking through the desert when they collapsed only to be saved shortly after by the sight of a raptor.  I am sure it was not that easy.      Lastly, although not related to the movie, I found it funny to see Kenneth Branagh's larger than life portrait on the cover of the DVD as if he was a primary character in the movie or contributed anything significant to the project.  His role could have been played by almost anyone who had a free day to memorize some lines.  Marketing at it's finest.

B000W4KT64|4.0|I usually hate dumb movies.  and Hairspray is undeniably dumb.  It deals with segregation but in a very shallow way - integration is right, segregation wrong, and the only people who want segregation are the bad guys.  But the movie doesn't pretend to be anything but dumb.  It doesn't pretend to be subtle either.  In fact, some of the lines are funny in their unsubtlety - \\"nice WHITE kids who like to lead the way - and once a month we have our negro day!\\" sings Corny on his show.  It's funny, looks good, and has some great songs.  As long as you don't expect it to be serious and deep, it's a fun romp that's good for a few hours entertainment.
0790729369|5.0|This a slow but great movie, with one of the best performances I've seen before. Meryl Streep is phenominal as Francesca. At the end of this movie there is scene, where Francesca is about ready leave her husband and she is in a truck and cannot decide. It is one of the most superbly acted scenes I have ever seen on screen and it's all Streep. I wish Hollywood would just get over its jealousy over Streeps talent. This women lost the oscar to a woman who plays herself over and over and over again. Streep disappears in her roles. She is absolutely wonderful in this film. She made this movie. I didn't even much like her before this film, but then I went back and saw her other performances. I am hooked. Come on Hollywood, respect talent. Get over yourself.
B000000WJK|5.0|\\"Urban Hymns\\" lovers might not care for it, but this is the best of the Verve's fleeting but extraordinary and influential career. A Storm in Heaven easily makes the list of my top ten albums of all time, which is a list that spans four decades.<br /><br />There's a little bit of everything in this sonic extravaganza...from softly and pyschedelically haunting to hard driving rock. I have to agree with some of the negative comments about the production work though.  The vocals on some tracks are far too muted, relegating Ashcroft's incredible vocals to background instrument status.  That's not necessarily a bad thing I suppose, because the multiple lush layers of guitar really shine through.<br /><br />This is an absolute \\"must-have\\" for your collection.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I had never heard of Blokus before coming to the Amazon.com website.  Read the reviews and product info and figured I'd give it a try for my niece (6) and nephew (9) for Christmas.  It was such a hit - not only with the kids, but also the adults.  The premise of Blokus is to get rid of all your pieces by placing them on the board only touching the corner of your own pieces.  (You can touch any other person's piece, doesn't matter how).  Sounds simple, but the pieces are all in odd shapes of 1 to 5 boxes.  Some are straight, some form a corner, one is a box shape, etc.  The board is made of sturdy plastic base with raised indentations making the placement of pieces easier and keeps them from shifting around while playing.  This game combines strategy, thinking skills, planning, and sometimes pure luck.  The best part is that each time you play, the game changes since each player choses the placement of their own pieces, and you have to work around them, the board will never look the same.  I highly recommend this game for kids and adults alike.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is an amazing telling of the struggles that William Wilberforce goes through to get the slave trade banned in England.  It has great acting on all parts especially Albert Finney as Newton.  A great family movie, my wife and I really loved it.  It takes a little bit to figure out what they are talking about with the laws and rules of England at the time.
B000002P5W|5.0|Jimi's second album is something of a middle child, sandwiched as it is between the monumental Are You Experienced and Electric Ladyland, but it really is a brilliant record in its own right. It features some typically freewheeling guitar excursions, with hypnotic feedback explosions crashing into beautifully twisted melodies, with elements of funk, blues, and jazz melding with delirious psychedelic melodies. The album also features the brilliant rhythm section of Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell, who lend an oceanic and dreamy feel to the whole thing. Anyway, how can you deny the power of a record that includes the freak-psych-jazz generational anthem \\"If 6 Was 9,\\" or the beautiful laments of \\"Little Wind\\" and \\"Castles Made Of Sand?\\" There are also pop-oriented (sorta) gems on the level of \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" and \\"She's So Fine.\\" \\"Bold As Love\\" is a stunning conclusion, with startlingly gorgeous melodies and a soulful guitar solo. This is just another work of genius from Mr. Hendrix.

0613174674|5.0|Well-written (or well-translated) story of a young boy whose passionate teenaged affair with an older woman turns into an experience that shapes and defines his life. Ultimately the novel becomes an examination of human behavior and motivations. As the truth of his lover's past unfurls, a non-judgemental narrator grasps for understanding & later finds a way to reconnect. Poignant, sad, thought-provoking & passionate. Definitely a novel worth reading (a fast read too).
B0007OASII|5.0|I think the best test of an album's merit is to place it in the context of music you would want on a desert island (with an unlimited power source and a CD player and headphones).  For years my number one was Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime and while that opus still makes the cut, the number one slot (is) are now (and probably forever more) held by Kamelot's Faustian inspired tale as told on Epica and the Black Halo.  I have been listening to these albums since their release and everytime I still want more.  Simply put, these albums soar above anything else in the genre: production, packaging, composition, and delivery; these albums are simply unassailable.    Some comparisons are sure to arise, particularly to Queensryche (Khan's vocals are similar to Geoff Tate's in many ways but rest assured, his talent stands on its own merits).  Compositionally speaking, particularly on \\"III Ways to Epica\\" and more specifically \\"Memento Mori\\" the songwriting may be compared to Dream Theater.  Let me make it clear, Kamelot's songwriting is simply more accessible without sacrificing any of the technical virtuosity evident in Berkelee's wonder boys' song writing.    Simply put, the songwriting and story telling capabilities of Thomas Youngblood, Roy Khan and the guys are truly masterful.  Hat's off to the men of Kamelot... may they receive the acclaim they deserve and continue to offer us more truly great music.  Epica and The Black Halo are my choice of the \\"must have\\" album(s)for my desert island scenario, followed by Mindcrime I, The Wall, Streets-A Rock Opera, and TSO's Christmas Trilogy.
B000QFBW6K|5.0|Creating a filmed version of a work that was intended to be experienced in the theatre is never an easy task, and even the best recordings often disappoint on at least some (even if nonessential) levels.  This recording of the 1991 and 1992 Kupfer and Barenboim Ring Cycle is, without a doubt, among the best recorded versions of an opera I have ever seen, and one of the undisputed highlights of my dvd collection.  Whether because of the wonderful cast, superb orchestra and conducting, or (largely, if not always) enlightening design and direction, this production simply works.  Despite being rather a traditionalist myself, I found the design of this production to be mostly remarkable, visually arresting and intellectually stimulating more often than not.  The costumes and staging have a distinctly modern, largely minimalist feel, yet they nevertheless manage by and large to do justice to the sense of timelessness that keeps Wagner's masterpiece relevant almost 150 years after it was first performed.  There is enough of tradition here to retain the sense of historicity that should be a fundamental part of any good Ring Cycle, respecting its foundation in ancient myth as well as looking simultaneously to the future.  Having said that, there are moments when the production looks to the future in ways that I don't find particularly enlightening.  The whole post-nuclear destruction premise jars in my opinion with what the focus of the Ring ought to be, and the interjection in the final minute of what is purely the director's fancy is in my view completely wrongheaded and distracting.  Nevertheless, new productions wouldn't be worth seeing if they all attempted to merely copy the romantic traditionalism of, say, Otto Schenk's Ring for the Met (which is, as far as traditional productions go, as good as they come.  In that vein, the production is just about perfect, featuring scene after scene of picture-perfect romantic imagery the way the Ring was meant to be performed.  However, I tend to tip my hat to the Kupfer production, as it is, I think, more dynamic and exciting overall.  But both are excellent), and to the most part, Kupfer strikes new ground in ways that are interesting.  And of course, while qualities of a production are important to note in order to differentiate it from others (and on the whole, I do think this one of the best, and certainly my favorite of the 'modern' Rings), any version of the Ring must stand or fall by the virtue of its cast, conductor, and orchestra; and the music itself is marvelous.  I personally love John Tomlinson's Wotan, and he is beyond a doubt among the recording's greatest virtues.  It should be noted that his voice is not one that everyone loves equally in the role; for sheer beauty and elegance of phrasing, one would do better to seek out James Morris in the Met's recording.  However, I cannot imagine anyone portraying Wotan more powerfully on the stage, imbuing him with a stronger sense of the admixture of pride, power, and ultimate world-weariness that exemplifies the character, and I would recommend anyone interested in the Ring at least witness his wonderful performance.  The rest of the cast is of a similarly high quality, with other highlights including Siegfried Jerusalem's excellent Siegfried and Anne Evans's brilliant and heartrendingly poignant Brunnhilde.  The interplay between Tomlinson and Evans is especially striking; one really had the sense of two operatic giants on the stage--theatric spectacle at its best, and alongside Barenboim's lush orchestration, its most profound.  This is, overall, one of the most dynamic Rings, well-acted and quite often thoroughly riveting--which is, ultimately, one of the main reasons I would choose it as probably my favorite despite quirks in the production.  In summary, a masterful production of one of opera's most difficult works to conceptualize and stage well.  Ideally, one would want to own this as well as the Schenk production to pair thebest of the traditional with the best of the new; however, for a single recording, one can't do wrong with this one.  Highly recommended indeed.
1594481717|5.0|A Whole New Mind gives an excellent and well-written analysis of right and left brain thinking.  Pink provides the lay reader with a clear description of how the brain works while making a case for androgynous thinking.

B000MRX6SO|4.0|I just got one of these for Christmas. It's fun to use and is good at picking up stuff and getting to hard to reach areas. However, if there are people in your house who have long hair like me, the long hairs get wrapped around the spinners and you have to use a tool they provide you to cut off the hairs that get wrapped around the spinners and brushes. It might be faster to just use a broom like in the olden days!

0060922583|5.0|Even though I would prefer to have concrete evidence that certain phenomena exist, or can be replicated...this is NOT the world that we live in. Science has evolved to a point where it is understood AND accepted, that there are occurences that cannot be explained via the typical routs of analysis and observation. THIS IS THE POINT TO THIS BOOK. Not that these possibilities discussed in The Holographic Universe are supposed to be scientifically proven. Those who give this reading anything lower than 4 stars are in the unfortunate classification of what the author is explicitely stating...BOUNDED BY LAWS that they feel comfortable with. Proven, replicated, observed, and measured variables. This is NOT where science is heading NOR has it been since these models discussed have come to fruition. Point being: If you are a scientist, philosopher, psychologist, theologist, humanist, mystic, or basically someone who is willing to be open to the vastness of the how and why...whether on a professional level OR amature as myself....you will find this reading inexpendible in its assumptions. I personally think Talbot has expressed VERY CLEARLY a possible connection to how everything may be interconnected with examples laid down since the beginnings of these theories. I look forward to reading more books by Talbot AND the underlying principles of what is becoming more and more accepted within the theories of Quantum (theories) possibilities. Enjoy.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|I said after the release of City of Evil time and time again, A7X will save rock and roll.    With their newest release, I believe they have done just that.     Avenged Sevenfold I also argue is probably the most important band in rock music right now after putting out this offering. And I will explain why.    In a world full of copycats, one hit wonders, wannabes, repeats, and people who just plain cannot play, A7X doesn't do anything new or anything that has not been done before. However, what they do, they do very well. And, they play the hell out of their instruments.    A7X takes virtually every kind of old school metal influence, and perfects it. From M. Shadows' gravelly Axl Rose-like howling on \\"Gunslinger\\" and \\"Dear God\\" to his sinister growl reminiscient of the Waking the Fallen days on \\"Critical Acclaim\\". Shadows is probably the best frontman on the market right now. The Rev is the best drummer in metal, hands down. Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengance's riffs, solos, and complementation of each other reminds us of Slash and Izzy Stradlin of the old school GNR days.    Whether A7X is playing the furious, and driving beats of \\"Almost Easy\\" or the operatic and grandious \\"A little peice of heaven\\" A7X leaves almost no influence unturned on this record. Shades of Iron Maiden, Guns N Roses, Van Halen, and Metallica run rampant in this release.     And while some old A7X fans dedicated to the old A7X records and the punk sound may not quite dig this record, It is a very important step for the whole of metal, and a very important step for this band. Avenged takes a solid stand in the very unsure world of metal music.     And I think they score big.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|This album was given to me by a friend and it is now one of my favorite albums. I find myself listening to \\"Neon Bible\\" over and over again. I wish I could write a more coherent, thoughtful review than this in order to justify 5 full stars.  However--as some other reviewers have pointed out--this group has a sound that's a hard to describe.  It's certainly not for everyone and I'd definitely recommend that one should listen to at least 3 or 4 tracks before plonking down cash for it.  I'm not nearly as crazy about \\"Funeral\\" as I am \\"Neon Bible\\". Anyway, the reason I love it is that it manages to be very complex and layered without bogging down. It's also extraordinarily unique (to my listening experience anyway).  If they are copying someone I've never heard the definitive source material.  I suspect they have a wide diversity of influences ranging from Roger Waters, U2, and Morrisey to who knows what.  I found the album immediately appealing and accessible on the first listen...yet complex and interesting enough to have staying power for me.  The lyrics are saturated with emotional images when read on paper...yet somehow sort of understated in the songs themselves (melodramatic content without overly melodramatic delivery...if that makes any sense).  I've read them and listened to them many times and still haven't quite figured it out what it all means.  I don't think they lyrics are intentionally vague I'm probably just too dumb to pick up on all of the deeper meanings about religion and this post-industrial existence most of us struggle to wrap our brains around.  The lead singer demonstrated some obnoxious antics on at least 2 TV performances (smashed his guitar on one, smashed a studio camera on another).  I for one could do without that sort of juvenille crap. Is this supposed to impress us with his \\"intensity\\"? Or shock the audience? It doesn't... it just looks narcissistic and stupid in my opinion. Regardless, back on point:  in spite of that nonsense, thereis a definite musical genius at work here somewhere in this band.  It appears on the surface to be a fairly egalitarian group. The whole band seems to be chock full of talent, not just the apparently bratty front man.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|One of the best high-seas films ever made since \\"The Caine Mutiny.\\"  And one of the best historical dramas ever.  Just don't make the mistake in thinking that this is your typical good guy vs bad guy movie, or else you'll probably be bored to tears.  If you want a movie that takes place on the seas but with the good guy / bad guy stuff, then stick with the Pirates of the Caribbean films.      But if you want a compelling story about a crew of men who come together through trials of conflict and great peril (sans the lame computer special effects), then look no further!  By the way, I also recommend the Patrick O'Brian novels that this film is based on.  I think it's blasphemy that this film was nominated for 10 Oscars, but walked away empty-handed ('Return of the King' getting Best Picture instead of 'Master & Commander?'  You've got to be kidding me!).
B000NVIGC0|4.0|It's a really good album if you are in the proper mindset for it.  Mellow and laid back without being dull.  The companion video is nice, too.  I almost gave it 5 stars. The imagery in the lyrics are poetic without being too obtuse or pretentious. The music and words fit together quite well without feeling forced.  The song structures and melodies are also fairly memorable without sounding overtly \\"hooky\\".  It took a little while to grow on me, but it's become one of my favorite albums.  I appreciate them not over cooking this one and keeping it a slightly raw. It's a little rough around the edges, and lacks some polish but this approach worked really well for \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" and is often far better than over-thinking and over-engineering an album.

But this movie is still lots of fun: excellent camera work and film editing keep it brisk and moving, many funny and famous bits of dialogue, Arnie's exaggerated accent and wooden acting, a generous amount of carnage done in a half-cartoonish style---all the essentials still work!<br /><br />Kept me giggling throughout, just like in the old days...
B000WMFZMY|5.0|The first of Anthony Mann and Samuel Bronston's ambitious and intelligent epics, El Cid has to boast the most gorgeous use of the widescreen ever - the Cid and Chimene's first meeting makes the most of every inch of the screen, while Robert Krasker's gliding camera is remarkably sympathetic to screen format, architecture and exteriors alike. Indeed, the whole film displays Mann's typically intelligent use of location, here in interiors (often his weak spot) as well - during their bleak wedding feast, he keeps Chimene and the Cid at a distance, the staircase where he killed her father (never a great start to any marriage) prominent between them; and while the good king's court is filled with colour, light and people, once the weak Alfonso assumes power it is a dark, empty hall. Despite some occasional over emphatic Christian imagery - when he's not standing in front of a cross, he's literally carrying one - this spectacular account of Spain's greatest hero uniting Christians and Moors alike against a common enemy, making friends of enemies and teaching his weak king the path to greatness by example manages to put a surprisingly human face on the myth of the perfect knight: the Cid's quest to do the honourable and right thing brings him little joy and much sorrow and even his resolve is nearly broken by his burden.     Charlton Heston when he was still an icon instead of a political target is one of the few actors who could carry off such a part, and he does it very well despite his curious conviction that Mann's superb direction was below par. The pomp and splendour never swamps the drama, and the setpiece duel for Calahora still stands out as one of the most remarkable and remarkably vicious screen swordfights of all time. A great score from Miklos Rozsa and good support from John Fraser and Douglas Wilmer too, although Andrew Cruickshank's portly King's champion implies that there was something seriously amiss in the kingdom long before the warring infantas succeeded to the throne!
0375842209|5.0|When my book club selected this title I was more than a little skeptical, especially since it was written in a very different style than I was used to and billed as a 'young adult' book.  Once I started reading it I became swept up in it.  It was very interesting to view the events of WWII Germany through the eyes of German people who were not captivated by Hitler's rhetoric.  It is easy to forget there were brave souls who, in their own ways, protested his iron rule, often risking their own lives and comfort to do so.  The Book Thief would be an excellent companion to The Diary of Anne Frank. This book should be a must read for every adult and young adult. It is a book that stays with you long after you have finished the last chapter.
B00000F14B|3.0|The Music Man wears its length more heavily than many Broadway-to-screen musicals, probably because Meredith Wilson's show boasts too many `samey' tunes and is built so comprehensively around Robert Preston's Howard Hill that you soon realize that it's made up of variations on the same scene played over and over. It is certainly too long, too many of the songs serve no purpose, Michael Da Costa's direction is occasionally over-literal (we don't need those cutaways of train wheels or chicks to sell the songs) and Pert Kelton's Oirish act is enough to make you throw stones at the screen, but it has a couple of great numbers and it still has enough fun left in it to make areturn trip to River City worthwhile.

076781326X|5.0|Carol Reed's screen version of Lionel Bart's musical version of Oliver Twist seems to fall into the love it or hate it category. Many find stodgy and drawn-out and even its admirers have to admit it is not without its faults. Some of the frenetic moments are not best timed and at times the performances are pitched more for the theatre than for the screen. Nonetheless, it is one of the very few successful British musicals and as such has much to recommend it.    Among a colourful cast, Harry Secombe's Mr Bumble is right out of Dickens' pages while Ron Moody's Fagin and Jack Wild's Artful Dodger are an engaging pair. As Bill Sykes, Oliver Reed makes a (by his standards) restrained and effective villain - his first appearance is a marvellously handled moment. If his uncle's direction is sometimes uncertain, the production values are sumptuous, with John Box's intricately haphazard sets and Phyllis Dalton's intelligently designed costumes coming over particularly well.    Bart's score is unusually strong and Onna White's choreography, while not without its tired and contrived moments, is considerably more energetic and enjoyable than is the norm for these shores. Indeed, Consider Yourself, which seems to call upon the entire city of London, is an outstandingly staged number by any standards. With the exception of some ill-advised string work on As Long As He Needs Me that sounds more South Seas than South London, Johnny Green's orchestrations are for the most part fine.     With Reed and cinematographer Oswald Morris both showing a good eye for the Scope frame, although the colour somewhat muted - it's a feature of Morris' work that the original colours were deliberately graded to reflect colour prints from the Victorian era.
B000852GIQ|5.0|So I finally got this album for Christmas!  It's a great expansion to my Yann library.  As of right now track 4 (\\"La Veillee\\") and track 14 (\\"7:PM\\") are my favorites.<br /><br />As for comparison to Yann's other albums, I don't find this one to be so full of melancholy like prior albums.  It's not as purely French as some of his other music has been, either.  I've also never been a big fan of lyrics with the music; I prefer it just by itself as I think it expresses all that it needs to without any words.  I think there are 5 tracks on this album with lyrics.<br /><br />I will add also that unlike some others, I was not disappointed in the \\"Goodbye Lenin!\\" soundtrack.  I thought the sound went perfect with the film.  It did take Yann a bit out of character, but \\"I Saw Daddy Today\\" and \\"Summer 78\\" will remain some of my very favorite Yann tracks.
0767853636|3.0|Annie is watchable enough, but despite the lavish budget - not always apparent onscreen - it never hits the highs. More solid than inspired, and typically anonymous for a later Huston film, Arlene Sellers characteristically derivative and unimaginative choreography is a problem: all too often at cross-purposes with the plot, the dancers manage to make it look better than it is, but that's not really the idea. Much of the cast are wasted and a couple of the songs thrown away, but at least it's not a disaster of Chorus Line proportions.<br /><br />The anniversary edition includes a 12-minute interview with Aileen Quinn, music video for Play's version of It's a Hard Knock Life and the trailer, but while the original edition offered a decent but not outstanding 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, the anniversary edition is cropped to fullframe. Sony's region-free Blu-ray offers a similarly less than stellar transfer, albeit in the original widescreen ratio, that doesn't look much of an improvement over an upscaled DVD with the same extras as the anniversary edition as well as three TV spots, the full trailer and a teaser trailer that includes much behind the scenes footage, though not the original TV making of documentary from the film's release that included, among other things, footage of an alternate version of Easy Street to the one used in the film.

039460430X|5.0|D.H. Lawrence daringly wrote about sexual mores in this novel, to an extent that his socioeconomic theme may have been lost by many of the readers.<br /><br />Constance Chatterly - affectionately depicted as Connie or Lady Chatterly - is the highlight and nightmare to her husband, Lord Chatterly. After a whirlwind marriage and honeymoon, the lord returns to Word War I's catastrophe and is \\"shipped home smashed.\\" He is a paraplegic for life, and someone who cannot provide an heir to his family's estate: Wragby.<br /><br />While confined to the walls of the stately mansion, she is effectively a  widow who will never know her sexuality. But she is not alone as one friend tells her, \\"You have to snivel and feel sinful or awful about your sex, before you're allowed to have any.\\" Sex is a suppressed sin - not an appreciated act.<br /><br />Her lover concedes women are no fun. \\". . . the mass of women are like this: most of them want a man, but don't want the sex, but they put up with it, as part of the bargain.\\" In reflection, being married to a paraplegic may be a blessing to those very women.<br /><br />But, her lover discovers fun with sex,  and vice versa. They actually conjoin in orgasm. Lawrence writes about this, he writes about their propinquity of flesh, of cuddling and more. In return, England banned publication of this until 1960. Almost 32 years this book was shelved by the prurient aristocratic publishers who cringed when reading about the sex, and the details of the same.<br /><br />But, Lawrence's statement is stronger. Lady Chatterly does not have sex with one of her class - no she opts for one of the servants of the manor. Oliver Mellors, a bloke who chooses to speak in Derby accent instead of proper English (which he is capable of doing) lights a flame to her inner hay stack. And, she goes wild.<br /><br />Although married to be a Lady, Connie is not from such top-notch stock. But, she is still greater than a commoner, and her sister Hilda remarks about their tryst as \\". . .how impossible it is to mix one's life with theirs. Not out of snobbery, but just because the whole rhythm is different.\\"<br /><br />Those people, the colliers or coal miners, are the people who work the colliery owned by Lord Chatterly. He effectively supplies income to every person's house - at least enough to keep them fed and housed, while they toil in the depths of his mines' bowels in disgusting filth and horrible conditions.<br /><br />Lawrence saw his father in such mines, but saves us from learning too much of the daily toil - this is not a revelation of bad working conditions like Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle.\\" But, this is a statement about social injustice, like Sinclair's \\"The Jungle.\\"<br /><br />In the end, all good comes of a bad situation.  The commoner is anything but common and Connie's daddy sits and drinks with this potential Gold Digger and leaves the pub slapping the man on the back and opening his heart and soul to the man who somehow managed to have his daughter leave the comforts and prestige of Magbry.<br /><br />Scenes like that at the pub remind me that Lawrence obviously read Dickens - like probably all his peers did. And, his novel is comparably great as it hits the forefront of not only social injustice, but attacks Victorian restraints on sex, much like other great novelists of England - including Virginia Woolf.

0765357151|3.0|When I bought this book I assumed the entire contents were a novel called I Am Legend.  I was quite surprised when about half-way through the novel it became a short story and ended.  The remainder of the book is filled with Matheson's short stories in the horror genre.  They are certainly quality reading in their own right, but they were not expected and therefore I was resentful while I read them!  That said, the main story, I Am Legend, is well-written and haunting.<br />The trailers of the movie adaptation of the book seem to convey a horror/scifi story about the last man on earth (and his dog).  The book is quite different.  It is really a story of grief, loneliness and the torturous effect of having and losing hope and gaining it back again, only to lose it.  You get the idea.<br />Matheson's protagonist, Robert Neville, is a blonde, blue-eyed sensitive every-man who was bitten by a vampire bat somewhere in Central America sometime in his unexplored past.  This is never developed so we don't know why he was in Latin America. We just know that this event somehow inoculated him against a pandemic that turned the entire human race into regular dead (like, stayed dead)and \\"undead.\\"  These are not zombies, per se, but rather thinking human beings who have become single-minded predators with a need for living blood.  Yes, vampires.<br />Most of the story takes place in a fortified house where Neville is safe from the blood-thirsty neighbors.  The reader feels his anger and loneliness and the writing is nuanced enough to make you pause and wonder if you would be able to maintain the will to live under the same circumstances.  Some of the key storylines involve a ragged dog that wanders into Neville's world, his self-taught science experiments with infected blood and efforts to develop a \\"cure\\", and his memories of his life with his wife and daughter, both of whom he had to toss into a large fire pit of burning dead people (that way they stay dead).  One element that Matheson writes about very powerfully is the approach of night.  Night is, of course, when vampires wake-up and kill things.  Night is really the main villain in this story and its approach is the only element that affects Neville with bone-chilling fear.  There are some very exciting moments when he is outside of his fortress and night is approaching too quickly for him to get back inside.  As the years pass, and the story seems to span about five years, Neville becomes less and less able to experience his humanity.  He has become a survival machine.  The end of the story is, perhaps, the most compelling as it gives us a glimpse at evolution and a new form of human life.  I won't spoil it by over explaining this, but it was interesting enough a proposal that I was irritated when the story ended just as the ideas was reaching development.<br />It's worth reading and certainly is an amazing proposal about the possibility of the all-powerful human race brought to the edge of extinction by a virus -- particularly clever look for being written in the 50s.rites about very powerfully is the approach of night.

140120306X|2.0|Black Dossier has been a long time coming. Plagued by copyright squabbles and endless delays in publication, fans of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen at times despaired of ever seeing the book in print.<br /><br />It wasn't worth the wait.<br /><br />Far from the 1890s, in which the first two League adventures were set, Black Dossier takes place in 1958. A pair of World Wars has passed, as well as the Big Brother era set forth in George Orwell's classic 1984. Former Dracula's bride Wilhelmina Murray, now a blonde but still youthful, and adventurer Allan Quatermain, rejuvenated and posing as his own son, are the only remainders of the previous (but not original) League.<br /><br />But where earlier volumes focused on adventure and conflict, Black Dossier involves simply a book about League history. Mina and Allan want to read it, even though it's largely about them, and certain forces in the British government want to stop them from doing so. That's pretty much it.<br /><br />Oh sure, I'll give the book credit for incorporating a young James Bond, Emma Peel (nee Night) and Bulldog Drummond among the forces arrayed against them. But, while the literary references that punctuate these books have been a delightful puzzle in the past, many of them in this volume are so obscure as to be tedious.<br /><br />It's well documented that creator Alan Moore spent much of the creative period for this book in a slap-fight with DC, which owns the America's Best imprint under which the League books to date have been published. And it seems to me Moore -- who has since severed all ties to DC and has promised future League books to Top Shelf -- basically just tossed a bunch of ideas into the Cuisinart to produce this mess.<br /><br />Artwork by Kevin O'Neill, on the other hand, is as professionally handled as ever, and DC outdid itself in its presentation, which includes a heavier stock of paper for certain sections, a Tijuana Bible insert and fancy 3-D glasses for use in the bewildering conclusion. Sadly, Moore let his readers down. It remains to be seen if he can woo them back with promised future volumes.<br /><br />by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(net) editorreaders down.

B0001JXQEM|5.0|What a great way for a band to start, by making one of the greatest albums in Rock history! I can't get tired of \\"the Blue Album\\". I listen to it about six times a week and it still isn't old. It is pure genius, there is no other word to describe it. What I love about Weezer is that their sound is their own, you just can't find Rock like this like you can on a Weezer album. Each record always has something new, which really adds to the lifespan of the album. That's why this one has stood the test of time.<br /><br />I mean, look how many hits are on here! There isn't one bad song to be found. Even the lesser known songs on here are amazing. I truly can't stop listening to the album. Perfection

The film is intelligent, unusual and apart from one scene (too many rats - you'll know it when you see it), the critters actually grew on me! I bought the DVD as a Christmas present for my sister in the US and it arrived very quickly indeed. Her family loved it as much as mine (3 and 7 years old) and my husband was guffawing all the way through. Resounding success!<br /><br />Warning to the people who found \\"Happy Feet\\" offensive (still don't get why, sorry), there is a scene with passionate kissing between the 2 main human characters. Just so you know... :)

Moving in a folk/ballade direction, they remind me of Blackmore's Night or even Steeleye Span. My biggest gripe with the band is Marco(?) still trying to be a screamer, but I think he sounds much better on songs like The Islander. And don't prolong the sniping at ex-members, rock soap operas are getting old.

B000009RC2|5.0|After making his mark in the growing jazz-fusion genre through both his solo work and through his work with both Miles Davis and Lifetime, John McLaughlin formed the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1971. Their debut album, The Inner Mounting Flame, further expanded the boundaries of fusion with its inclusion of classical music.  With its complex arrangements, tight musicianship, and changes in momentum, this album is one of the most adventurous not only in jazz, but in recorded music period.  Also worth noting is that The Inner Mounting Flame is a group effort and not merely a showcase for McLaughlin as each member adds plenty to the proceedings.<br /><br />  The opening \\"Meeting of the Spirits\\" is very dramatic as Jerry Goodman's classical riff provides the foundation for McLaughlin's wild guitar work and Billy Cobham's explosive drumming. \\"Dawn\\" starts out very subdued before becoming a funk/rock jam before returning to its original theme. Jan Hammer's sparse piano adds a lot of color throughout the track. \\"Noonward Race\\" is a relentless piece reminiscent of Miles Davis' \\"What I Say\\" as both Goodman and Hammer get to show off their impressive chops while Cobham and bassist Rick Laird lay down a sick groove. \\"A Lotus on Irish Streams\\" is a beautiful yet complicated piece that is highlighted by Goodman's sweet playing and Hammer's lightning fast arpeggios and McLaughlin's classical runs. \\"Vital Transformation\\" is another fast paced jam containing a lot of start/stops and more awesome drumming from Cobham. \\"The Dance of Maya\\" starts out very spooky before it becomes one crazy blues romp. \\"You Know, You Know\\" is based entirely on a quiet yet sinister McLaughlin guitar line but is never boring thanks to its occasional accented notes and the interplay of the band. \\"Awakening\\" is a wicked jam featuring a short solo by Cobham before reaching its chaotic end. All told, this is one of the best fusion albums ever released, one that gets better with each listen. Highly recommended.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Great HBO series.  This movie was like watching Saving Private Ryan, but 10 times in a row.  The quality is easily good enough for the big screen.  Acting is great and you really get a feel for what those guys went through.  I give this a 4-star not for the content, but for the container.  Its really nice metal case reminds me of something military-like, very nice, but it makes it an awkward size for fitting on the shelf.

B000002KDG|5.0|It may be an exaggeration to say that Rust Never Sleeps saved my life, but it certainly lifted me out of a pit of despair in 1979.  I was 23, living 200 miles from friends and family (i.e., lonelier than I thought I would ever be), and working for a moron.<br /><br />The real irony of getting hooked on Rust Never Sleeps is that in college I hated Neil Young because I had been a HUGE fan of Crosby, Stills, & Nash (never mentioning \\"Young\\" in the group's name), and had thought of Neil Young as the guy that destroyed that super-group and also Buffalo Springfield.  Sort of like Yoko did for the Beatles, except that Neil did it twice.<br /><br />But one Sunday evening in the summer of 1979, a syndicated radio program played an interview with Neil Young, and the topic was his concert film, Rust Never Sleeps.  Much to my surprise, Neil did not sound like the devil, but like a legitimate artist that was more concerned with being true to his art than he was in being commercially successful.<br /><br />I checked the movie listings in the local newspaper and saw that Rust Never Sleeps was playing at a theater across town, so the next night I went to see the movie.  It made me ridiculously happy, so the next morning I bought the Rust Never Sleeps vinyl LP, and listening to it day after day (and later, Live Rust and Comes A Time), I was able to survive my crappy job and The Summer From Hell.<br /><br />For Christmas this year I bought Roxio Toast, with CD Spin Doctor, and started recording my old vinyl albums onto my Mac, and one of the first to be recorded was Rust Never Sleeps.  Just for grins I went to Amazon to read reviews, and it was interesting to see where I agreed and disagreed with the other reviewers.<br /><br />Powderfinger is one place where I diverge from the prevailing opinion.  Although I like the song, it never seemed to me to be the greatest song Neil ever wrote or performed.  From the electric side of the LP, Sedan Delivery and Welfare Mothers have much stronger places in my memory.  I guess the humor that I needed in 1979 made those two songs more appealing.  As a side note, whoever thinks that Powderfinger is about Native Americans should listen to the song again.  The characters sound to me like they are from the backwoods of the South.<br /><br />For the acoustic side, most reviewers love Pocahontas and Thrasher, and I'm with everybody on those.  Of course, both Hey Hey, My My and My My, Hey Hey are great.<br /><br />And as mentioned by some other reviewers, Live Rust is wonderful, too.  The versions of Cinnamon Girl and Tonight's The Night make the entire record worthwhile.<br /><br />Finally, if you have never seen the Rust Never Sleeps movie, buy it NOW.

0307387151|1.0|Atonement is a tedious novel.  The author was told as a youngster that he had a penchant for detail.  Is it ever given in an excruciating manner with no purpose in sight.  Most importantly, the author should have read Kundera's book \\"The Joke\\" and would have learned that one must stand up for inequity at the moment, not years past, otherwise your life is meaningless.  Consequently, the novel is morally corrupt.  McEwan has the character Briony choosing to write a story over speaking out for her wrongdoings.  Two people die as a consequence of her actions.  Furthermore, McEwan presents a novel as fiction, then disguised as Briony, declares that these are merely words and they shouldn't be taken seriously and if so, the writer is like God so atonement is not neccessary.  It's a poor blending of fiction and reality.  So if McEwan is your friend in real life, he'll choose a good story out of it and leave you hanging out to dry.
1596912855|5.0|Have you ever wished you could visit England during the time of Jane Austen?  I would love to walk in the gardens, visit friends, go to balls, meet Mr. Darcy, and experience Regency England.  This book makes it possible to travel back in time through the eyes of the main character, Jane. I savored every moment while reading this enchanting book by talented writer, Shannon Hale. I bought the book for other members of my family and they all read it, even the men.  I have had readers ask me where Austenland is located in England and when can they book a vacation there. I tell them the book is fiction.  They tell me they know the book is fiction, but where is Austenland? This book makes fiction seem real. Will someone please create a real Austenland so we can visit it?

B0001L3LUE|5.0|An excellent analysis and presentation of McNamara and his view of the Vietnam war and war in general.
B000001FTA|5.0|From strength to strength as a recording band, nevertheless Thin Lizzy were reduced to a three piece once more due to the temporary incapacitation of Brian Robertson. Unfortunately for Robbo this would ultimately lead to his exit from the band. For 'Bad Reputation' most of the guitar duites fell to Scott Gorham who was often looked at as a second banana in this celebrated partnership. However Gorham produced arguably his finest work as an axeman and 'Bad Rep' is a better album for it. Despite the hiatus of Robbo, 'BR' contains much of the trademark harmonies that defined the band's sound. The title track is an incredible piece of street metal which also includes another outrageous performance from Brian Downey. \\"Soldier of Fortune\\", \\"Southbound\\" and \\"Dear Lord\\" further demonstrate that sometimes less is more. Robertson does contribute killer leads in \\"Opuim Trail\\" and \\"Killer without a Cause\\" (another classic!) but Scott takes care of business quite well. And Philip? He's the same genius as always whether emulating one of his heroes in \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" (Van Morrison) or making one of his celebrated confessionals in \\"Dear Lord\\" (I believed your story now you believe mine!). \\"Dancing\\" proved to be a minor hit for Lizzy but their last real success in the States would have to wait til the live record. 'Bad Reputation' the album would prove to be the end of an era as far as the band's studio albums went, the last stand of troubled genuis Brian Robertson. For consistent, brillant hard rock in the mid to late seventies, there was none better than Thin Lizzy. Time is right to settle scores!

B000TGJ8IU|2.0|My wife and I just finished the director's cut of Troy and we were both greatly dissapointed.  None of the new footage was remotely interesting, save for the last scene which shows the refugees fleeing Troy after the city is destroyed.  Honestly, most of the \\"new footage\\" was new cuts of old scenes where camera angles, dialog, and minor differences (i.e. dogs and [...]) are actually more annoying than helpful to the movie.<br /><br />The biggest problem however, lies in the soundtrack.  One of the reasons that Troy was so good IMHO, was that the score hit the emotional chords so well.  Almost the ENTIRE soundtrack was redone - and no way was this done by James Horner.  The Achilles theme is gone, the Rememberance theme is barely heard, even Josh Groban's song is gone from the credits.  Basically - the entire emotional content of the movie has been altered.  I felt like I was watching the same movie (except for the quirky differences noted above) except the soundtrack had been replaced by \\"generic war music\\" put on random/repeat.<br /><br />I'm out of room on my review so I will just say this - keep to the original film at all costs.  This is definitely not worth the double dip, and not worth it for all of the \\"new\\" footage.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I am not a fan of war movies.  Which is why I found myself surprised to not only be thoroughly enjoying Band of Brothers, but also, to be recommending it to others.  One early scene made me like this drama.  The soldiers have arrived in France on D-Day, they capture an enemy soldier, who turns out to be...  from Portland, Oregon (\\"My family's Austrian, and we answered the call of the Motherland\\").  That scene really drove home to me the impossible and crazy situation that those men were put in.  Excellent drama, great special effects, good acting.  I also like the veteran interviews at the beginning of every episode.  This is a show about war that anyone, including war-movie UNenthusiasts, will enjoy!

B000002UAX|5.0|This may not be the Beatles best album, but it is still worth every penny.  I got it for Christmas and I was pretty excited.  The best songs have to be:    Back in the USSR  Dear Prudence  OblaDi OblaDa  Wild Honey Pie  Bungalow Bill  While my Guitar Gently Weeps  Martha My Dear  Blackbird  Rocky Racoon  Don't Pass Me By  I Will  Birthday  Sexy Sadie  Helter Skelter  Honey Pie  Savory Truffle  Cry Baby Cry    Every Beatles album is worthwhile.  They all have their hits.  Every Beatle fan needs this album.  There is a perfect balance of Paul, John, George and Ringo on this album.  (Don't Pass Me By is sung by Ringo, but surprisingly it is really good!)  The album might seem expensive, but you have to realize that it is a double album.      I would SO reccommend this to any Beatles fan!                                --Kari :)

B000IMUYJM|4.0|Most of you know Bob Clark's famous movie \\"A Christmas Story,\\" which was released Christmas 1984, but ten years earlier, Mr. Clark tried his hand at a different type of \\"Christmas\\" storytelling, and it doesn't require a prococious narrator to get the message across. Forget the silly remake that was released on Christmas Day a couple of years ago, this 1974 shocker is the one to watch. First of all, it doesn't rely on gore and blood to fill in for the lack of script. Partly the reason why remakes usually are inferior (Planet of the Apes, Psycho, Willy Wonka, Halloween), is there determination to make an already great film better, which is nearly impossible. None of the above mentioned films needed to be improved upon, and Black Christmas can be added to that list.<br /><br />Black Christmas predates John Carpenter's Halloween by four years, but it provides every thrill of that film, plus its characters are witty and more intelligent. Clark makes good use of POV (point of view) shooting to allow viewers to survey the mayhen through the stalker's eyes. The fact that there are so many things unclear about the character makes us watch and listen more intently. The phone calls are truly creepy, and although Kidder handles the perverted caller flippantly, we are genuinely afraid for her and the other soriety girls. As a bonus, the film also includes Olivia Hussey (Romeo and Juliet, It). I always found her to be an underrated beauty. Watch the movie alone with the lights turned down--you will be frigthened, and perhaps a bit tentative to answer the next phone call at your house.

I bought this book simply because I packed my other into my checked luggage and needed a read on a 4 hour flight.    WOW - what LUCK!  This was a terrific book.  I polished it off in a matter of days - completely unable to put it down.  The characters are very well-developed and I was extremely interested in what happened to them.  I was delighted with the entire experience. It's a daunting size but I zipped through it was sorry to see the end.   If you like history, architecture, romance, religion, politics, intrigue, disaster, lost-love, friendship, and so much more - you'll find it here.
0609610570|3.0|I feel bad for the reveiwer who unfortunately had to miss the first half of what sounds like a freakin' awesome vacation because they were waiting for this book to deliver deep insights.  If you read their good review you will realize that those insights never really materialize.<br /><br />In what seems to be a trend with modern management books there is an honest to goodness 40 pages or so worth of excellent material in here, and it is pretty basic fundamental type stuff, but it is padded with repetition and completely unhelpful examples till it is its more \\"publishable\\" length.  Unfortunately I thought the padding in this book was particularly bad for a leadership book, being basically boast sessions that were so foggily written that you didn't really pick up much useful advice from them.<br /><br />The biggest lesson in this book is that the key to executing is hiring and promoting people that have a proven track record of execution.  Err . . . thanks.  The rest is pretty motherhood type stuff, like operational planning needs to be tied to strategy and be realistic in terms of being based on the capabilities the company has.<br /><br />Another caveat for anyone in the military as this book is currently being hawked in a lot of defense circles.  It really is geared towards businesses producing products for the consumer world.  As such only the people leadership and personnel development parts of this book are really relevant to military operations.  It thus contains about 20 pages of real use for officers and NCO's.  Getting to these 20 pages is a bit of a pain since the authors are not as direct or succinct as they should be.

0465011047|4.0|\\"You people don't deserve to live, but the Party and our Great Leader have given you a chance to redeem yourselves.  Don't squander it and disappoint him.\\" So says a guard in Yodok, the place which is featured in this book.  It was identified as \\"Border Patrol of the Korean People, unit 2915,\\" however, as the North Korean regime sought to disguise it's real purpose.  Kang Chol-Hwan arrived at its gate at age nine, along with his sister, father, and grandmother.  As the author states herein, \\"We weren't sent to the camp as criminals but as relatives of a criminal.\\"  That so-called\\"criminal\\" was his grandfather and the charge leveled against his grandfather was \\"a crime of high treason.\\"  The real reason that Kang Chol-Hwan's grandfather was arrested, however, was that the North Korean police state, having duped his grandfather into returning to Korea with the fortune he accumulated in Japan, no longer had any need of him once they had got their hands on his wealth.  This book is replete with examples of many other well-off Koreans, also inspired by revolutionary propaganda, who likewise left comfortable lives in Japan hoping to contribute to building communism in Kim Il-sung's Korea, but who, instead, were fleeced of their assets and wound up spending time in places like Yodok, one of the \\"Aquariums of Pyongyang.\\"<br /><br />The author, though, tells us almost nothing about any concentration/work camp/slave labor camp other than Yodok, the place where he was imprisoned for ten years.  So the book is really about one \\"Aquarium\\" (and he utilizes the term because he actually brought his fish bowl with him to this prison, as well as attempting to coin a Korean phrase reminiscent of the Gulag Archipelago).<br /><br />The first 148 pages of this rather brief book concerns the author's first 8 years at Yodok.  He discusses how he was forced to trap rats for food, how his fellow political prisoners were kept in rags, denied adequate food; how they were worked to exhaustion.  He also describes the execution of some prisoners: \\"The Party was willing to forgive this criminal.  It gave him the chance here at Yodak to right himself.  He chose to betray the Party's trust, and for that he merits execution.\\" The man supposedly betrayed the state by trying to escape from his slave-labor camp. Moments later the commanding officer directed his guards thusly: \\"Aim at the traitor of the Fatherland...Fire!\\"  So much for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.<br /><br />After telling us about his first 8 years in the camp, the author admits this: \\"As the years passed, another feeling began to disturb my daily existence: the feeling of injustice, which grew sharper when I considered the discrepancy between everything I had been taught and all that I was living.\\"  The writing herein, unfortunately, is a lot like this; not particularly personal and bereft of much emotion.  (Maybe this has something to do with the fact that the author told his story to a French journalist---whose name appears on the cover of this book---and the book was originally published in French, perhaps having lost something through two translations.)<br /><br />The final two years the author spent in Yodok's labor prison are glossed over in 6 pages, then his escape to South Korea, via China, is addressed in the final 40 or so pages.  In total the book only numbers 238 (rather large print) pages and there's no index.  I wish there was a lot more to this book; more about how many places such as Yodok exist in North Korea, how many people might be incarcerated in them and the like, and more of the minute detail of goings-on in such places (as opposed to the broader brush strokes offered by our author herein) so as to be better able to \\"feel\\" what it must have been like for the author to survive 10 years in such a ghastly place.

I have to say John Singleton made this film his own giving us a great visual set piece in Miami. If only the \\"Miami Vice\\" film had what this  movie has going for it in the visual department it might be easy to watch.

I didn't think I'd get that into it, but it is really well written, and it helps that all the characters come from the mass imagination, so we sort of already know a little about them.

0446577391|2.0|David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors but this is my least favorite book of his, he must've been preoccupied when he wrote it or he was just too lazy to be as clever and inspired as he usually is. The first half of the book is good even with too many \\"coincidences\\" with characters leaping to amazing conclusions based on mere hunches, but the second half of the book was just all too hokey, it read like Baldacci was tired of the characters and just wanted to get the book completed. The plot was full of holes and silliness. I've read every one of his books and for the first time, I'm not looking forward with bated breath to the next one.

The way the story is so true to life (being from the diary doesn't keep it from getting any realer than that), to the way they inserted friends and families responses to the diaries, to how discriptive Nikki's whole journey was.  Probably because I too am a recovering addict, but the whole time I'm reading this book I'm feeling exactly what he was going through, from the self loathing, to the denial, the relapse, and then to the final victory.  Thanks to Nikki for showing the unglamorous side, so vividly, of drug addiction.  But more importantly showing that with persaverance you can overcome anything.  Definately well worth the purchase and the donation to the charity that the proceeds are going too.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|While I'm a huge fan of this movie I purchased this second copy on Blu-ray expecting to be dazzled. I feel that I was let down as far as what I was expecting from such a visually appealing movie. If you already own this on standard DVD I wouldn't recommend the blu-ray, however if you don't own the standard go for it. Great movie for sure.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I got an awesome CD for Christmas called All the Lost Souls, by James Blunt - that I just have to tell you about! For those of you who are a little skeptical - let me tell you a bit of history and then some details about the actual CD. When I put his CD on my wish list - it was because I heard the title track \\"1973\\" on the Music on Demand Adult Alternative station. I thought it was really good - but I'm not up enough on the current artists to realize that he was the same person who sang the \\"Your Beautiful\\" song. Had I known that James Blunt was the one who sang that song - I probably wouldn't have put him on my list. I'm just not into love songs that can easily be sung at weddings. Not that there's anything wrong with them.....    Well, this CD really stands out in so many ways. The lyrics are clever and surprisingly deep. I don't know if I'm trying to make too much of it because I like it so much - but there may even be some Christian under-tones. The title of the album is All the Lost Souls and the title track is \\"1973\\". Even though I can't find any connection between the lyrics of \\"1973\\" - it is ironic to me given the title of the album and the huge event in 1973 that rocked the nation (Roe vs. Wade). The song that really gets to me (and seems to support this idea) is called \\"Same Mistake. It is just beautifully written and has a really haunting melody. But, the funny thing about poetry is that you can often make it out to mean what you're looking for, so who knows? The actual video for this songs shows that it has absolutely nothing to do with abortion - but maybe a guy who is a thief and leads a rather promiscuous lifestyle. So, there you go. Anwyay - here are some of the lyrics that made the above mentioned connection for me: \\"Saw the world turning in my sheets and once again I cannot sleep....Remember the rights I did wrong....And so I sent some men to fight, and one came back at dead of night. Said he'd seen the enemy. Said he looked just like me, so I setout to cut myself and here I go. I'm not calling for a second chance chance, I'm screaming at the top of my voice. Give me reason, but don't give me choice. 'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again....\\"    Also, there is a song in which he actual invokes the Holy Spirit called \\"I'll take everything\\": \\"Oh these feet carry me far. Oh my body. Oh so tired. Mouth is dry. Hardly speak. Holy Spirit rise in me. Here I swear, forever is just a minute to me.\\" It goes on to say: \\"Have my body. Have my mind. Have my coat. Take my time. These I borrow. Borrow so far. Turn to dust. Fall apart. Here I swear, forever is just a minute to me.\\" There is more connection in the song \\"Shine On\\", and elsewhere on the cd. Don't know if it is actually there - but interesting nonetheless.     It does have some humorous songs as well and there are also some really sweet songs - but I won't take away all the surprises!
0374530718|2.0|There is a mysterious story within a story in the novel Sophie's World, written by Jostein Gaarder. He is a master of language, yet it is that mastery which makes his novel less appealing toward the audience who do not have a predilection for philosophy as it is extremely dense and verbose. Sophie's World acts as a history of philosophy through lessons from a philosophy teacher named Alberto Knox and his young pupil, Sophie Amundsen. Alberto first starts by teaching Sophie through letters that he mysteriously dropped in her mailbox. The first letter only read: Who are you? From her constant questioning we learned that she would be the perfect philosophy student, open minded, curious, and intelligent. Over time he revealed himself to Sophie and the true and strange reason he started teaching her philosophy from the beginning. However, the mysterious philosophy teachings are not the only things that baffle Sophie, throughout the entire novel Sophie receives letters and other objects addressed to Hilde Moller Knag c/o Sophie and Alberto constantly tells her that they must finish their teachings to fully understand Hilde's world. The audience could find themselves hoping for the end to this seeming less endless book at times. At times, especially during the philosophy teachings the writing becomes monotonous and tiresome, and I end up praying for Sophie to finish reading or Alberto to conclude his lecture. I enjoyed the story of Hilde Moller Knag much more than the stories of Socrates or Sartre. I expected a much more interesting novel based on the title, not a creative form of a textbook, which essentially Sophie's World is. I could have gotten a much briefer description of the world's most famous philosophers on Wikkipedia. In no way would I recommend this novel as a free read, if you are a reader who will be majoring in philosophy next semester I may recommend it as a textbook.
B000I0QK74|4.0|This is a great Christmas album!  The track with Nataile Cole is fun and delightful.  I grew up with James Taylor and this disc is so comfortable.  A must for 70s kids.
B000YENUI6|5.0|This is a fabulous movie, and I dont much care for Naomi Watts. Mortensen was superb, much better in this than LOTR, (I like to blame it on the directing) he has an extra creepy something also found in 'Leatherface' and 'History of Violence'. Of those 2, the latter was clearly better, but none in comparison to this. If you don't like the genre, then you probably won't like the movie, you shouldn't see the movie and therefore you shouldn't be writing comments-you're just wasting everyones time including your own.<br />This is a David Cronenberg movie from start to finish, not much more to say about it-you either love it or hate it. i loved it!

1932100660|5.0|I was lead to this book by my Internet research while trying to figure out why my SureSlim \\"doctor\\" recommended diet was causing me to have massive hair loss. Having read The China Study, I have since found numerous other references which corroborate the conclusions Colin Cambell was led to. This book has changed not only my life, but my husband's and my son's lives  as well. I purchased 20 more copies and gave them to friends and family this past Christmas. Upon reading the book, my husband said \\"I don't think we should give this book to anyone else, I don't think they can handle it!\\" I have to admit feeling much the same way, however, I feel much better if people are able to make an informed decision for their lifestyle and their futures, rather than living in ignorance and dying in an untimely manner. Oh yeah, and my hair has grown back and I continue to lose weight at a realistic pace (5 pounds in the last month) without dieting!
0316067598|1.0|I recently finished \\"The long road home\\" which led me to this book. I don't question how brave and heroic the characters are but I just can't get past the poor writing.
B000T46O8O|5.0|This is one of my favorite films ever.   Every character is quirky and endearing.  The movie's premise and how it plays out is gripping and kept me absorbed, so much so that I was literally holding my breath at the end to see how it would turn out.   I've recommended this movie to everyone. The soundtrack also rocks.  It's just a solid, lovely, wonderfully engaging film and Will Ferrell as a pure drama actor is magnificent.
0374280967|5.0|THE UNCOMMON READER is a marvelous book.  The premise is that Elizabeth II should be allowed a hobby, disallowed for a royal as to have \\"an interest\\" excludes those who do not share that interest.  Throwing all caution to the wind, Her Majesty discovers, via a comedy of errors...that she has a passion for reading.  That passion, enjoyed by many of us...is examined in a subtle and thoughtful manner.  The book is a balance of introspection and humour.  Do not read ahead...the ending is pure joy...and for me, a complete surprise!  The only question remaining...when the movie is cast...will it be Helen MIrren or Judi Dench?  My vote would be...Penelope Keith.  This book is a \\"short read\\", no longer than a few hours...and a pure delight.
0440238609|5.0|In a visual world it is all too easy to let others take over your imagination. You accept other peoples' visions as your own. It is convenient, easy, saves your effort but in effect makes your creative abilities go first numb and then dead. This is a book which may help re-awaken what you might have forgotten ever having. Or what you never had, brought up in front of a TV screen.<br />It would be a spoiler to give out any hints about the content - anyway, it is too complex to be summed up in a review in any but a ridiculous way. The important part is that Pullman creates a whole new world in his book, a world at an angle to ours and he gives you a chance to join him in the trip this book is, imagining the world he describes. If the book had nothing more to offer (and it is hardly the case) this alone would make it a perfect choice.<br />I could never understand why Harry Potter became a world bestseller and Pullman lagged behind. Let's hope that the movie and general interest that follows will give Pullman the place he has always deserved.
0143038419|5.0|I'm not a religious person but I found the book awoke a yearning for peace and resolution in me. It isn't even focused on religion but does follow the writers path and experiences. I learned so much about the countries she visited and loved the imagery. The writing was great and even if I didn't agree with her, I liked how she wrote it. I have a BA in literature and have read hundreds of books but really felt this one was extraordinary.
B000I2J2XQ|5.0|HD DVD is really the BEST.  The picture quality & audio quality is amazing on this HD DVD release of Harry Potter. I have them all, and I am very happy with them. Much better than the SD DVD version by far.    The movie itself is great, just like when I seen it in the Theatres. A must own for anybody.
B000G2YD3C|5.0|This is a very strong initial release. The prog influences on this disc  are overwhelming. Pink Floyd is the most obvious, but that is only part of the story. The band may be thinking Beach Boys, but I am hearing The Moody Blues. Early King Crimson and ELP also come to mind. Mix in some White Willow with a touch of Tool and the end product, that may at first sound very derivative, becomes something that sounds familiar yet new at the same time. As with any good prog release, there are some wonderful passages tucked inside, but more importantly everything on this disc works. Don't forget that there is almost 5 minutes of silence before you get to the last track.

I have a four year old boy and he enjoyed it just as much as I did.  We watch it almost every weekend just to keep us on are toes while prancing around the house cleaning and cooking.  I appreciate anything Beyonce sings out of her one of a kind voice.  Please keep bring them on.  Me being a single mother and all, I cannot afford to go to see her live so I so appreciate her putting her live concerts on DVD for those who do not have the money or the time to go see her live, up close and personal.

0143038419|1.0|This book should be called DON'T-BUY-ME...I rarely, rarely purchase books of this type and did so on a whim since I had heard it was so great.  I was SO incredibly irritated I didn't even make it through Italy...From what I ready, I found this woman incredibly self centered, severly lacking in self esteem, totally lost beyond words. Nothing I could relate to...  To think I funded this woman's diatribe annoyed me badly.  I intially decided to throw it out, but I used it as a fire starter - as I curled up to read a real book.  Unless you are lost and confused beyond words, or would like to learn how to be, just skip this colossal mess of a money grab.  The only satisfaction I derived was watching it burn!
B000P0J02E|5.0|This soundtrack is very beautiful and to me seems complete. You should know that music from almost every moment of the movie is available, (hidden) in specific tracks.    For example, the dramatic music from the moment when Elizabeth escapes from the Dutchman (also when James Norrington is killed) is available but it doesn't have its own track. It's in the end of a 7 minute track called \\"I see Dead People in Boats\\".. Same thing for the music introduction of Flying Dutchman (when it appears out of no where and bombs the ships around it).     Music is very high quality and enjoyable. Highly recommended for every POTC fan.

B0010YPTGU|5.0|I've watched this PBS special countless times and I have already pre-ordered the DVD.<br /><br />This is the best live Bocelli performance I have seen. I won't duplicate the other reviewers breakdown of songs and musical stars, but the mid show duet with Sarah Brightman on \\"Canto de la Terra\\" blew away their closing duet of \\"time to say goodbye\\". This new duet, (song originally released on Sueno) has raised the bar for Bocelli/Brightman collaboration. There is a chemistry there that has to be watched to appreciate.<br /><br />Heather Headley turned in two powerful vocal performances that are a second favorite highlight of the concert. Headley's vocals seem to blend extremely well with Bocelli. R&B meets Classical and the result was a stirring duet that will be hard to duplicate with anyone else.<br /><br />Laura Pausini's performance was also a warm moment in the show. As Bocelli went to his knee to sing to her, she lost her breath in the moment of being sung to by the great Bocelli.<br /><br />Turn down the lights, light a few candles, put in this DVD and get lost in the romance of Bocelli's vocals and the surreal atmosphere of Tuscany in the summer.
B000VNMMWA|5.0|This movie is awesome, and the 3-disc Collector's Edition is really worth the extra couple of bucks.    It has 5 commentaries on the movie, as well as a copy of on of Edgar Wright's AmDram movie, \\"Dead Right,\\" which has two commentaries on it as well.    The discs are all loaded with fun little stuff that we've come to expect from producer Nira Parks and her crack team of players. Pegg and Wright's writing skills are at their best, and Pegg and Frost would carry the movie on with their acting, but every side character steals the show at some point. Just when you think they are going to be the best, someone else comes up and slaps you in the face with awesome.     The movie has an all-star cast (from the UK anyway), and is simply one of the most fun movies I've seen since... well... Since Shaun of the Dead.     This is an action movie to rival any movie is pays homage to.
B00007AJF8|4.0|The film is deeply funny because of the grossness of the concrete realization of the argument of the plot. It is muddy, dirty, crawling in a corridor, perverting in the most grotesque way Alice in Wonderland looking through the looking glass and sharing an apartment with an ill-mouthed parrot and a chimpanzee. The hole in the hedge is a rat hole in the wall and the only attractive thing in it is the glass doorknob. Then the plot is absolutely funny. It is based on one person being able to crawl inside another person and impose his or her personality onto that other person. That's strange but very fast it becomes ah ah because of the identity of the person inside and the identity of the person with whom the inhabited one is having relationships, discussions, rapports, even intercourse of course. In a way it is perverted since a woman can live her love for another woman by accepting her to be in the man that is the vessel of that intruder or invader. If the man is invaded by a woman and has a personal relationship with another woman, the two women are making love, to the point of procreating a girl, their daughter. That's definitely ah ah. Then the film deals with phantasms in the heads of Western men and women. Everyone wants to be able to make their desires and emotions towards anyone whatsoever real. But after all you have to keep some appearances, as a British TV series about a certain Mrs Bouquet used to say, and that's how the inhabited human vessel can enable so many possible connections to take place. Then it shows that success in our society does not depend on the value you have but on the value the public persona you are living in has. If you live in the body of a great person anything you will do will be successful and seen at once as great. Finally, and that's the punch scene at the end of the film, this possibility to transit from one person to another will enable some old people to get into younger bodies and live forever. The very fundamental myth of the Western world, but a myth they have never dared to realize in a religious belief or philosophical theory. The Buddhist did it but not the Christians, nor the Moslems, nor the Jews, the three Semitic religions. So Hollywood is playing the role of the provider of eternity to the few who will believe it because they have always dreamed of it. Blessed be the gullible, ... So all in all a funny film that makes you feel at times kind of ill at ease.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinese Western world, but a myth they have never dared to realize in a religious belief or philosophical theory.

B0002O39A2|5.0|Space Shanty is an obscure but brilliant 1972 release that features Steve Hillage (Ex-Gong) on guitar (and vocals) and Dave Stewart (of Egg, Hatfield  & the North, National Health, and Bruford) on keyboards. The music is a powerful psychedelic progressive excursion with some of the best solo and ensemble work that you'll hear on any album of this vintage. If you like Hillage's wonderful \\"Fish Rising\\" album (his best solo effort) then you need to check out this disc. There are two previously unreleased tracks on this new version plus excellent liner notes. Highly recommended.

I guess over the past years we've all been spoiled by the sophisticated computer-generated animation on more recent movies, and this movie doesn't have that new rich detail.  But the songs and the monkeys and that bear are just as fun as I remembered them.

0670034711|1.0|I read this book up to page 39, and then dropped it off at goodwill. i actually almost felt bad about leaving it for someone else to eventually buy, as i don't like the idea of taking part in the distribution of such drivel. . but i hate throwing things away. as for this book, or for the 39 pages i read, i gathered that this is nothing more than a character study of the typical modern, self absorbed, spoiled, narcissistic, shallow,  white, american woman searching for more meaning and spiritual discovery and closeness to god......by becoming even more self absorbed, spoiled, narcissistic, and shallow. i assume she has lots of friends in high places that helped push this one down everyone's throats. i personally would love to see the modern empty self epidemic healed through serving and sacrificing to a greater good...community, family, country, poverty, etc...rather than implying that contentment and getting right with god means turnign within yourself and focusing solely on what you feel, what you think, what you want, what you say, what you do...... it is very sad that so many people in this country are giving this book rave reviews....there are many many many great novels out there that deserve attention and never receive it. The writing level is middle school at best. very sad.

140120306X|5.0|The highest praise I can give to this book is that it makes you want to read more! Not just more Moore but more EVERYTHING! The layers and depth to almost every panel on every page draw your eye to new references and ideas at startling speed. It means I spent at least as long on the internet googling 1950s soap powders or  Edwardian ghost finders or 3D specs as I did reading and re-reading the book itself, and that's the joy of it!    At times it can be so intriciate it's almost daunting but it is worth the effort.    If you have not read the previous League stories do so before you mine these pages in order to get the best seam.    Its not going to be available in the shops outside the US of A because of some copywright wranglings so snap it up quick sharp!
B000N3ST7K|5.0|From the opening engine revs of Jack Nitzsche's \\"The Last Race\\" to the fadeout of April March's bouncy \\"Chick Habit\\", the soundtrack to \\"Death Proof\\" perfectly captures the feel of the movie, and once again testifies to Quentin Tarantino's ability to create the right mood in his selection of sometimes-obscure but always-appropriate songs for his soundtracks.    The people who are complaining about the sound quality of the songs on this collection have missed the point entirely.  The majority of these songs are clearly depicted in the movie as being played from old vinyl 45's on the jukebox at the Texas Chili Parlor...the jukebox which in real life belongs to Tarantino himself.  It's likely that these tracks were taken from the records in that same jukebox, and rightly so, because every hiss, scratch, and pop in those tracks only adds to the flavor and atmosphere of the movie.  The sooner you understand this, the sooner you can fully enjoy this soundtrack for what it truly is.
B000WGZGNS|2.0|I like a lot of Beyonce's songs and her style, but the performances on this DVD were lacking. She demonstrated that she's not the best dancer, and that her voice sounds better when it can be retouched in a studio. Keep looking for other live shows by Beyonce, this one is not it.
0440241901|5.0|This has to be one of the most refreshing books that I've read in quite a while! I had never read anything by this author before so I took a chance.

Emma reminded me a lot of Bridget Jones and I would love to see this become a movie of some type! I've started reading other Kinsella books as a result!

038533348X|2.0|Slaughterhouse Five is one of my five favorite books ever. I keep trying to find something else from Vonnegut that exudes the same energy and necessity of that book. Cat's Cradle didn't do it for me. At the end of the day, the novel felt naked and didactic, like an excuse to shout a world-view. It felt self-indulgent to me.    There are a few areas in which a novel can excel in order to spark interest: plot, character, setting, and language/style. The Greatest Novel of All Time probably excels at all of those -- but I don't think that novel's been written yet. If a writer can nail two or three, it's probably worth reading. Heck, if you completely kill on one of those four, the novel will probably do well. For me, Cat's Cradle doesn't excel at any of the above.    The plot is thin -- and given that it's intended as comedy, that's to be expected. Still, there's no point at which the main character faces a Problem, battles with Complications, and then either succeeds or fails. Instead, the book's tension is based on withholding a mystery from the reader -- what's the deal with the ice and why does the author keep hinting at how important it is? It's not a very gripping source of tension and, from the standpoint of plot alone, there's no reason not to turn to the last ten pages of the book and see how it turns out. I don't feel like I would've missed out on key plot points by doing so.    Characters in this novel are thin and two-dimensional (if that). Again, this is meant to be a comedy, or a parable maybe, so stock characters may be called for. But by not having any actual depth or texture in the characters, character does not provide a reason to care about the novel. The characters come off as so subservient to the Message and are so devoid of reality, that their idiosyncrasies feel arbitrary and manipulative rather than interesting.    I'm guessing Cat's Cradle defenders would argue this point with me, but I found that the novel's setting was practically non-existent. At least, I didn't come away from the book feeling like I Was There. The eventual San Lorenzo is sparsely described and, as with the characters, seems entirely subservient to the Message. I don't feel like I get the sense of another actual place -- it felt like it was all happening on a sound stage. To a certain extent, the same could probably be said for Slaughterhouse Five -- except that with Slaughterhouse Five, well, first off there was, in fact, more attention to setting details, but also SH5 builds a landscape out of the minds of its author and protagonist. In Cat's Cradle, we get so little from the narrator in terms of his way of thinking, this doesn't happen. Maybe it should have.    Finally the writing and style of the novel -- well, it's the trademark Kurt Vonnegut style, except that he did it better elsewhere. There are no coy self-references like occurred in SH5, no cunning self-deprecation, no fierceness of joy in the absurdity of language and the novel format. It's just sort of jaunty and tossed-off and having read SH5 previously, the writing in CC felt like a weak and unremarkable shadow of what Vonnegut eventually accomplished.    As a result, I come away from Cat's Cradle feeling like I'd just read a thinly masked agenda story. And unless you already cling (heh) *religiously* to its message, there's not much fun to be had. In terms of communicative efficiency, it would've been more profound for Vonnegut to have simply written the sentence \\"People believe in and do stupid things, which is especially problematic when they have access to nuclear arsenals.\\" I didn't find anything in the novel that conveyed any other idea of any significance. And frankly, that message itself seems pretty dull in the modern world, especially without a fresher lens through which to view it.    All that said, while I didn't enjoy the book overall, I appreciated its brevity (that's not meant entirely back-handedly -- short novels rarely overstay their welcomes). Also, it's a very easy read, and there's a lot to be said for a writing style that allows for that. Unfortunately, I didn't find enough else in this one to make me care.    (PS, I've read some of the negative reviews of the book that knock it for being cynical and pessimistic. Er -- it's *Kurt Vonnegut*, it's *supposed* to be cynical and pessimistic. Cynicism in a novel can be done very well and its presence doesn't degrade the work any more than optimism necessarily would.)

Rose (Barbra Streisand) and Gregory (Jeff Martin) had a platonic marriage, yet I saw at least three framed pictures of their wedding in the house.  I could see indications that Gregory was developing deep feelings for Rose before he ever proposed. There was some indication that Rose's mother saw this, too, although she opposed the marriage arrangement. Rose's feelings were more apparent after the wedding.  There were some sad scenes:  the wedding ceremony that did not end in a kiss, the wedding night when Rose tucked her husband in, after he fell asleep watching the movie.  Rose just stood there watching him for awhile.  Rose's request for sex was quite humorous (nothing subtle about it.)  Henry (Greg's best friend) was a humorous voice of reason for Greg. When Gregory pulled away from Rose on the night they tried sex, and he declared, \\"I took every precaution to make sure there was no physical attraction,\\" that was one of the saddest scenes in the film.  However, there was a very happy ending.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Loved this movie, total Blockbuster. It has everything, action, comedy, drama and when you hear about the story behind this film being made, you have even more drama.  Not like any other Sci-Fi movie I have seen, its actually believable and you get totally immersed in the Serenity verse.  I recommend this to anyone who loves action, comedy and of course Sci-Fi, you won't be disappointed. Also check out the series which is a prequel to the movie called 'Firefly' and search online for the fan websites, the story behind it is heartwarming, although tearjerking.
0345494768|5.0|Good book. Great condition. Getting this book in paperback is just fine, but if you want this book in hardcover, amazon is the best bang for your buck.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Nice story.  Great for all ages.  Animation is appealing to young children, but appealing to adults as well.  We watched it during a family Christmas gathering, and the audience ranged from age 6 to age 88.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|\\"Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barbour of Fleet Street\\" will surprise a LOT of movie-goers.  It's a musical about a London barbour who is wronged and returns home looking for revenge.<br /><br />I'm usually skeptical of film remakes of musicals.  Being a fan of Tim Burton was enough to get me through the door.  I am really glad I saw it.  This is a very good movie that will satisfy a very wide audience, including those unfamiliar with the original musical as well as it's loyal fans.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Not for younger kids or squeemish adults.  This is one R rating that is well deserved.<br /><br />First and foremost, this movie is worth seeing in the theatres.  I expected this version to be even less \\"musical\\" than it was.  Surprisingly, it is VERY true to the original musical, with almost all the original Steven Sondheim score re-sung by the modern cast.  Musically, the songs and score are all well done and add to the theatre experience.<br /><br />Visually, Sweeney Todd is STUNNING.  This version is MUCH BETTER than any other previous version.  Tim Burton has created a dark and dingy London that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar for almost every technical category.  The black and white backdrop make the bright colors stand out when they are used.  Color is used artistically and powerfully, as you'll see.  :)<br /><br />The actors will also attract some die hard fan groups.  Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter have some very different fan bases, but I think both will be satisfied and surprised by the performances.  In fact the whole cast does wonderfully, and the director no doubt had something to do with that.<br /><br />This is also another movie where I will be looking forward to the HD DVD.  Hoping for a wealth of deleted / extended scenes and \\"making of\\" featurettes. As for the soundtrack, I plan on buying it today.<br /><br />Go see this movie.  You will buy the DVD.  And the soundtrack may be on your shopping list soon too.  There's a full version, and a \\"Highlights\\" version without the background tracks.<br />[[ASIN:B000X4OVLM Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street Deluxe - Complete Edition]]<br />[[ASIN:B000WEDAEM Sweeney Todd Soundtrack Highlights]]<br /><br />Enjoy!!SIN:B000X4OVLM Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street Deluxe - Complete Edition]]  [[ASIN:B000WEDAEM Sweeney Todd Soundtrack Highlights]]    Enjoy!!
B000MGUZMU|2.0|Funeral was an infectious album fueled by youthful angst and unbridled enthusiasm where nearly every track proved anthemic. The choruses were rousing and the percussion monsterous. Though the lyrics left something to be desired, it was difficult not to get caught up in the group's enthusiasm, especially with their killer live show. Critics unanimously hailed the album as one of the best of the year -- quite a feat for a debut album.    So of course Neon Bible has a lot to live up to.     I wasn't expecting them to top Funeral, and really, Arcade Fire don't attempt to with Neon Bible. This album goes in a pretty different direction. Sort of a goth-rock indie hybrid, Arcade Fire go for a darker sound with Neon Bible and come off melodramatic. They sacrifice the personal for the political in the songwriting, which would be fine if they had the lyrical chops for it, but sadly they fall far short. Instead of the youthful intensity  of their debut, most of the tracks on this album intend to be moody and introspective, but just lack content. There are exceptions: namely, \\"Keep the Car Running\\", which is just as good as anything off Funeral, \\"Intervention\\", with its driving organ part making up for the silly lyrics, and \\"No Cars Go\\", despite that it sounded better on their debut EP.   Arcade Fire had good intentions with Neon Bible, but I think they bit off more than they could chew with this album, and the product comes off as pretentious. I can see it pleasing a lot of younger fans, but those with more mature musical taste will probably detect the poor songwriting. And even with those who like it, I doubt it will have the staying power as Funeral. \\"My Body is a Cage\\" is a strong contender for worst track of the year...   I hope with their next album Arcade Fire tone down the melodrama and theatrics and focus on writing solid rock songs.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is a great movie that has gotten a lot of hype, and deserves it ALL!!!  Yes, it's about a high school girl who gets pregnant.  But don't get confused, this movie is not so easily classified.  It's not an after school special.  It's not \\"pro\\" or \\"anti\\" anything.  It's just a really well written and well executed film about a unique girl dealing with an all too common situation.<br /><br />There's a lot of plot elements to explore.  How will her friends and family react?  What will she do?  How will the experience change her?  No spoilers here: watch the movie and see it unfold.  :)<br /><br />First things first.  Everybody can't love every movie.  Some will under-rate this movie just because it has been SOOOOO hyped.  Believe me, I understand.  All I can say is this: see the movie twice, THEN make up your own mind.<br /><br />The way that mainstream movies get made, it's hard to have a script survive the teams of experts who want to appeal to this and that audience.  I could only detect a handful of planted lines.  The writing is SUPERB and very well presented with front to back execution - directing, acting, editing.  The dialogue is funny and original, like a much more literate Pulp Fiction.  That's what makes this movie special.  It has SOOO much going for it.

Is it Oscar worthy?  YES!  Without a doubt.  If Julia Roberts can win for Erin Brokovich, they should give Ellen Page her Oscar RIGHT NOW.  Once again, some will say it's overhyped.  Some only think that top notch acting occurs when characters are dying or demented.  I say real acting is good acting.  I walked into a screening before I saw a single review.  I watched the movie twice to confirm it - this performance needs to be seen and studied.<br /><br />The cast is chock full of big names who do very well in some good roles.  Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, and Michael Cera all have good performances.  But Ellen Page IS this movie.  She steals every scene, hits every mark and nails every line.<br /><br />And of course, the music ROCKS!  Those who are into indie rock, alternative and punk rock will recognize most of the music here.  Those who aren't will want to buy the soundtrack, because this is a great introduction.  There is a great mix of new and old, from Velvet Underground and the Kinks to Cat Power and Kimya Dawson.

B000VLOKQI|5.0|When I read some of the reviews for this DVD set before actually receiving it and watching it, I was nervous since this has been a long awaited DVD for about two plus years.  I will admit that \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" is probably better, but this is still one of the best Who DVDs in my opinion.  Just like many of you, I would have loved it if the movie included full songs and I would have loved it even more if the DVD set included the London Colesium and Kilburn gigs in their entirety.  However, another reviewer stated that these two gigs will be released separately in 2008 (hopefully that's true).  In my opinion, the movie itself is extremely well put together.  Yes, many Who fans are already familiar with the story of the band, but in this case, the way the story is presented is fantastic.  If the movie just had straight interviews from Townshend, Daltrey, Entwistle, Moon, Jones, Edge, Sting, Stamp, Vedder, etc. then it would not be as good, but the interview footage mixed with the archival footage make it very interesting after each viewing regardless of whether or not you get to see and hear the whole song.  I will say that the movie itself could have been at least an hour longer if they had elaborated on each segment, but what we do get is excellent in my opinion.  And the archival footage included is brilliant.  Who cares about the packaging?  I read so many reviewers complaints about packaging and I don't get it.  We don't play the packaging on the DVD player.  It's the contents of the DVDs themselves that matter.  The second disc, Six Quick Ones, is also fantastic.  All four films about each band member are great and very well put together.  The segment dedicated to Mods and pop-art is also fantastic, and the segment of Pete, Roger, Zak, Simon, Rabbit, and Lake in the studio recording \\"Real Good Looking Boy\\" is also great.  I really like the inclusion of the band performing at Railway Hotel (the camera people should've shown less of the people dancing though and more of the band).  The scrapbook is really good too particularly Bill talking about Cincinatti, Pete talking about \\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\" and Shel, Stamp, and Johns talking about the Who's early record contract.  For me, the icing on the cake for the DVD set is the bonus Live in Chicago disc.  Okay, it would have been nice to have a bonus live disc with Moon on drums, but to be fair, Jones does hold his own during the performance.  Plus, there is a better chance of a Who individual disc selling if Moon is on the drums rather than Jones.  Also, even though we don't get the whole concert on this disc, it still is fantastic.  In my opinion, the best performances are Substitute, I Can't Explain, Baba O'Riley, The Punk and the Godfather, My Wife, Sister Disco, Behind Blue Eyes, Music Must Change, 5:15, Pinball Wizard, Long Live Rock, Sparks, How Can You Do It.  Sorry but Drowned doesn't do it for me (Roger should have sung it so Pete could do more on guitar) and I don't care for The Real Me in its edited version.  Both those songs are much better on Live At the Royal Albert Hall.  The rest of it is great though and it's pretty well filmed for its time.  Plus, Townshend, Entwistle, and Daltrey all play and sing incredibly well and you can hear Entwistle's bass.  Great DVD set but buy it with the bonus disc.
B00005JPS9|4.0|Beowulf is a new version of a classic tale.  The animation style really comes to life when seen in Imax 3D.  This is one movie worth seeing in the theatre and owning in HD.<br /><br />There are three groups who will want to see Beowulf no matter what reviewers think: those who loved the Polar Express (same creators, same animation style), those who love mythology and war movies, and those who love Angelina Jolie.  And yet the real reason to see this movie should attract a much wider audience: this is a visually stunning \\"video game\\" on the movie screen.  While any new take on a classic tale will upset purists, this movie is worth suspending disbelief for the entertainment value.<br /><br />Visual Effects<br /><br />The animation of the film is very \\"cartoon\\" and \\"video game like.\\"  While that may not satisfy those who are looking for entirely realistic CGI effects, it is an artistic form that is very compelling when seen in Imax 3D.  Clearly, the technology will improve in future movies.  Regardless, the creativity and artistry of this movie should be appreciated for what it is.<br /><br />There are many 3D elements that leap out at viewers.  If they added smells and water spray it would be very similar to some Disney World 3D movies.  My only curiousity is how (if at all) they plan on making the 3D experience available to home viewers<br /><br />The Music<br /><br />The score is very well put together and complements the movie experience.  There is a lot of driving heart pounding composition, almost operatic in nature.  And there are also soft pensive songs.  In any case, the music is also well appreciated in a theatre, and sets this version apart from previous ones all on its own.<br />[[ASIN:B000WVUNXG Beowulf Soundtrack]]<br /><br />Acting and Direction<br /><br />The acting is really well tailored for the film, in as much as CGI can be.  Really, this is an accomplishment in direction and film editing.  You will find yourself asking, \\"who is that actor who plays Beowulf?\\"  And when you see Ray Winstone in real life, you will be even more amazed.  Robing Wright Penn as the queen and Anthony Hopkins as the king give the most classic expressive performances of the group.  And unfortunately for the Jolie fans out there, her role is somewhat minor in the scope of this movie.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />Those who read Beowulf will leave with a certain feeling of \\"Huh?\\" after seeing this movie.  The story has been changed, but in a purposeful way.  It is true that Beowulf comes across as more vulnerable than in the original accounts.  In the end, I defer to the creators.  They have created a different version of this story that should be appreciated on it's own.  Purists aside, it's an interesting take on the tale.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great entertainment movie.  See it in the theatre, get the DVD in HD, and marvel at how far we've come in the worlds of animation, computing and entertainment.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!even more amazed.

0553260111|5.0|No doubt many will read this (and the other Bourne books) because they've enjoyed the movie(s).  As with the films, this book is incredibly intense, complicated and action packed.  But it's far more than a potential screenplay.  The stories bear almost no comparison at all, the films being only loosely based on the general (brilliant) concept and main character ... and of course the dramatic opening scene of this book.<br /><br />The writer creates atmosphere perfectly.  Where his passages are descriptive (of environment, emotion or event), he keeps it taut and relevant - enhancing without weighing down the progress of the narrative.<br /><br />The action scenes are visceral, super-fast and, at times, brutal.  Often coldly efficient and compact, as I imagine would be the case in the incredible urgency of a desperate, adrenalin fired battle to the death.  Our hero acts on instinct, using his intrinsic skills, and is often confused by and even fearful of his extraordinary abilities.<br /><br />The dialogue is precise and constructed in a way that feels real - although quite stiff and dated at times.  This doesn't obstruct enjoyment of the book however and was probably right for the time it was written.  There's an awful lot of \\"My darling\\" and \\"My true love\\" between Bourne and Marie (pretty much replaced by \\"babe\\" and \\"hun\\" now!)<br /><br />One point that I was curious about: on three occasions the same unusual phrase popped up from sources of completely different background.  `Spoors in the forest' is used by a high class Paris fashion house owner, then a thirty year American CIA veteran, then Bourne himself.  Surely such different people would have different phrases to express ... well, whatever spoors in the forest means!<br /><br />We're often in Bourne's head.  Listening to his thoughts and internal desperate battles keeps us most definitely on his side and is a good contrast to the external action of the unfolding story.<br /><br />Perhaps Marie is just a little TOO cool in this crisis.  As she goes from economics genius, very much grounded in the sedate academic world of economics and politics to courageously dealing with brutal international assassins, covert government teams (it seems everyone on the planet is after Bourne), gun fights, rapists and kidnappers, as well as cleaning out bullet wounds.  And all in a beautiful red silk dress and high heels.<br /><br />It's a story of many layers and depths and hidden corners.  It races ahead ... and around, and back, and across, and ahead ... at dizzying speeds.  Is he good? Is he bad?  Which side is he on? How many sides are there?  Who is he?<br /><br />It's very exciting.  I've no idea how much of it is feasible but who cares!  Read and take note of every word because if you don't you might miss a vital clue!from economics genius, very much grounded in the sedate academic world of economics and politics to courageously dealing with brutal international assassins, covert government teams (it seems everyone on the planet is after Bourne), gun fights, rapists and kidnappers, as well as cleaning out bullet wounds.

B00005JPTI|4.0|Will Smith survives a mutant virus that has him running for his life from most of the other \\"survivors.\\"  So begins \\"I Am Legend.\\"<br /><br />The \\"I Am Legend\\" film is different from all previous versions of this story.  Many of the new plot and story elements will appeal more to today's audience.  Some of the esoteric and philosophical messages of the original story are lost, but this film stands on it's own.<br /><br />First of all, the burning questions: Is this film worth seeing in the theatre, or should I wait for the DVD to release?<br /><br />Answer:  GO SEE THIS IN THE THEATRE!!!  Also, films like this will make their HD DVD counterparts more attractive as well.  But I digress.<br /><br />The visual elements of this movie are worth the price of admission alone.  Everything is done well together - special effects, lighting, sound, aspect.  The in-movie songs used could have been more diverse, but the score more than makes up for it.  Bottom line, I would pay to see this in the theatre again, and I can't wait to see what it looks like in HD with 7.1 surround sound at home.<br /><br />Now, how about the acting?  Will Smith is really great in this movie.  Women will no doubt drool at the work-out scene that was put in every trailer.  He gives a very real portrayal that's more than just eye candy.<br /><br />Now, some of the story elements go backwards in the second half of the movie.  But I think that was done intentionally, agree or disagree.  They really wanted to show him fighting to keep it together, and breaking down at times, and the plot suffers as a result.<br /><br />As for the plot, there's no need to re-hash that or give spoiler details.  We all know the basics from the trailer.  See the movie and be surprised.<br /><br />One thing I am very interested in the future DVD is potential alternate endings.  Since this story deviated from the original, I wonder if there was any waffling on that.  We'll all have to wait and see.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good movie for SCI-FI fans and special effects lovers.  The story stands on it's own and is a very good production despite some minor technical blips.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!stands on it's own and is a very good production despite some minor technical blips.

B000WQW988|5.0|I'm glad this great show has finally come to DVD!  (I can't believe it never even came to VHS.)  This is a great, classic concert with some nice rehearsal footage thrown in for good measure.  This package is nice because you have the choice of watching the tight and clean MTV edit of the show, or you can watch the uncut version of the performance that shows all the stuff that goes on inbetween songs.  For Nirvana lovers, these little tidbits are gems that we relish.  Plus, whether you're a Nirvana fan or not, this show is one of a kind!
1594489505|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? Simply, this is one of the most heart wrenching books that I have ever read. The author explores the lives of two different, but similarly fated Afghan girls, and the trials and tribulations that they face every day. This book gives a glimpse into a world that at best many of us don't understand, and at worst what some of us condemn. The book praises many aspects of the Afghan culture, while criticizing some of its more despicable parts. I've noticed that some people have labeled this book as propaganda, but this really couldn't be further from the truth. The author shines a very positive light on much of the Afghan culture such as the positive religious influences, the strong family bonds, the appreciation for education, literature and the arts and the loyalty to both family and country. The book condemns the oppression and mistreatment of women, but makes it utterly clear that not everyone in Afghanistan finds the mistreatment of women acceptable. The author draws you into the lives of the characters, and I found myself at times laughing out loud and at other times holding back tears. I did feel that at a few points in the book the narration seemed to break down or there seemed to be a change in style, but other than that the book was very well crafted. This book is a must read, for everyone.      P.S. - The title to this review is a quote from a poem expressed in the book. I thought this quote, along with the title of the actual book, embodied the author's view on Afghanistan perfectly. How anyone could walk away from this book and think the author somehow disparaged Afghanistan is an absolute fool. The author clearly has a deep love and passion for his home country.

B0010X8NF0|4.0|Director Wes Anderson's film about three rather quirky brothers trying to reconnect (both literally and metaphorically) on a train ride through India after a year of estrangement does have a few bumps along the track. Sometimes the quirkiness is a bit too much to take, but those moments are few and far between. The climax of the film is masterfully done and explains the aforementioned estrangement quite beautifully.    Darjeeling Limited's themes center on discovery through journey, family and coping with loss. And like Anderson's two previous films (Life Aquatic & Royal Tenenbaums) Darjeeling Limited manages to explore these themes in a way that's comical, heart wrenching, yet ultimately uplifiting all at the same time.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|When the movie began, I was worried that it would be too explicitly brutal for my wife and me to watch.   After all, this movie revolves around the Stasi, East Germany's secret police.  But this film becomes a fascinating character study of a lost soul, an inauthentic man, discovering his humanity (as well as a history lesson on East Germany culture before the Wall fell).       The film is almost 2 1/2 hours long but we could not stop watching it as midnight approached, and had no idea where it was going. The story is engaging; the performances are excellent; the ending is perfect.    It certainly deserved the oscar it won.  When watching the oscars, I was rooting for Pan's Labyrinth to win for best foreign movie, but now I understand why they gave it to this movie.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Comparisons between the film Princess Bride are quite accurate and the director even says on the wonderful documentary included on the DVD that he intenionally set out to make his own Princess Bride. And he succeded wonderfully because just like Princess Bride STARDUST manages to be a feel-good-fantasy-epic-comedy all rolled into one film. Not too many of those around.    You wouldn't expect an all ages friendly film from the director of the film L4yer Cake, but that's exactly what Stardust is. Stardust is adapted from the comic book by Neil Gaiman & Charles Vess and maintains the magical spirit of the comic quite beautifully. This is helped out by the fantastic film score by composer Ilan Eshkeri.    This film is only available in a 1-disc edition currently, but the extra features are still quite good. The aforementioned documentary has interviews with the director, writer, and two leads. However, consipicuously absent are interviews w/ the film's two big name supporting stars (Robert DeNiro as a \\"whoopsy\\" pirate & Michelle Pfiefer as an aged witch). The deleted scenes include an alternate ending a little more in line w/ the comic as well as a blooper reel. No commentaries, but the wonderful documentary pretty much makes any commentary redundant any way.    I believe that much like the film STARDUST set out to emmulate, history will show this film to be not a box office flop, but rather a timeless classic.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|Honestly, I don't think it is even fair for me to review this album. I went and saw Daft Punk play this set live in Berkeley, CA and well... it was the absolute best show of my life. Revisiting it again on CD sends massive chills down my spine and almost brings tears to my eyes. I can't say enough to people about how good the live experience was. If you missed it, then I sure hope Daft Punk does another tour, because it is something that really can't be explained. The energy, the emotion, and the dancing... absolutely perfect. 500,000,000 stars from me.
B000I2J0VK|4.0|i evaluate movies by imagination's amount and connection to reality.  both of these factors are here.it doesnt matter if reality is fictional  as long as i consider it important.  what missing however is freedom of speech---most movies practice  self-censoring and this one is no exception.
B00005JPGO|5.0|I haven't seen a movie this good in a long time.  Leonardo was great - especially with the accent - it was very believable and the new actor that played the lead was absolutely fantastic.  I had no idea this was going on in Sierra Leone - it really brought it to my attention.  I would recommend this movie - as a matter of fact, I bought it for my daughter for Christmas.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This video is both very informative/educational and inspirational.  We need to be better informed about the seriousness of the subject of the story.  It was a dark time in our history.
0307346617|5.0|I am generally not a fan of fiction, but I found this book to be brilliant and enthralling.  The book has something for everyone: great storytelling, personal drama, action, political satire, social commentary, but none of it is really thrown into your face, so it is almost as if you can take whatever you want from it.  Despite the plethora of varying stories in the book, it is easy to keep track of them and nearly every account can be readily recalled by the reader.  I found myself really identifying with the characters and actually wanting to hear more from them (I was very pleased that most of the characters resurface in the book's final pages, concluding their interviews and even speaking about some of those characters not mentioned after their initial introductions). I simply couldn't put this book down.  Brooks makes you feel as if you are really someone reading about the book's events years after they take place, almost like a person of my generation would read about The Greatest Generation of World War II today.  Granted, there are some faults (i.e. a few extremely unrealistic stories, even given the circumstances, and what can be seen as an overreliance of blame on Iraq and the Bush Administration for failing to stop what was a global outbreak), however these are extremely few and far between and rarely detract from the overall flow of the story.      Don't let the fact that this book is about zombies or the fact that it is a work of fiction stop you from enjoying it.  It was hands down one of the best books I've ever read.
B000EXZI1Y|5.0|STILLWATERS is by far and away the BEST Bee Gees album. They just got better and better with each new release, and have proven they are capable of conquering any sound, and setting the standards for a few of their own.  Do to the unfortunate passing of Maurice, we will only be able to enjoy what has been, instead of looking forward to what is to come.  Having said that, I WILL continue to enjoy listening to the Bee Gees over and over again.
B000YA82F6|3.0|Although the script for \\"Juno,\\" the tale of an unwed pregnant teen, crackles with wit, sardonic humor, and irony, it is ultimately unsatisfying because of certain imbalances in its characterizations. Most notably, every male character in the movie--from her bumbling, but well meaning father, to her nerdy and dispassionate \\"boyfriend,\\" to the male half of a yuppie couple (who is an overgrown adolescent) to whom she commits her unborn child for adoption--is a study in male fecklessness and disappointment. \\"Juno\\" is too self-aware to be a \\"message film,\\" but it telegraphs the point that sisters can do it for themselves by handing off the responsibilities of childrearing from fecund teen girls to barren women with a career. And of course, just because the teenage protagonist, commendably played by Ellen Page, chooses to have a baby does not mean that this film is necessarily \\"pro-life\\" (to put the movie in strictly political terms).
B000VBJEEG|4.0|It was a good movie, nothing to bad for a child, It could've been about 15 minutes shorter though, and I would've liked to see more of Paris rather than mostly in a kitchen or sewer. I would give it a B rating
B000K15VSA|5.0|Special edition. Rare are the times when a DVD set actually earns that distinction. This limited Ultimate Collector's Edition does and Blade Runner deserves no less. Everything about the set, from the bonus items such as the Spinner toy replica to the actual DVD set itself, seems to have been created with great care. In the past I have seen other sets claiming to have special bonus items included and usually they were cheaply made and carelessly thrown in. Bait to lure in unsuspecting collectors. The bonus items in this set went beyond my expectations and are great conversation pieces I would be proud to have on display. The discs themselves are beautiful to behold and provide a fascinating insight into the making of the film as well as all five versions each with it's own introduction by Ridley Scott. If you're a movie collector, film buff, or you just plain love Blade Runner, don't miss out on this limited set. It will not disappoint.
0375846735|3.0|It is a tough act to follow the Subtle Knife, and being the last book in the trilogy , the Amber Spyglass almost fails to deliver , but if a book can be redeemed in a few pages, this book is a fine example of the genre. The Subtle Knife was about explanations a convergence of the threads that were frayed in the first part and the Amber Spyglass almost gives it away by starting parallel tracks which drone on and on without any logical explanation of where the story is headed. Lyra and Will enter the land of the dead, Mary Fulton follows an open window into a land with diamond structured beasts riding wheels which are actually seeds of a tree (life is a delicate web of inter dependencies). The cataclysmic war between the Almighty and Lord Asriel takes place which is rather short and somehow doesn't capture the imagination, though it does shatter the concept of a supreme being who/which is all powerful/moral.In an instant as God's regent falls, the clouds part and the message shine through and what a message it is. So while the author, in a rush goes around closing threads towards the end of the book, just as Will closed windows that he has left open across worlds the message holds you in a rapture. The body is a celebratration, cherish the moment, for there is no heaven to look forward to apart from the one we build for ourselves on Earth.

I went to the movies on open night and i left the threatre a happy happy customer. The movie is wonderful....story line is great and the charecters stay true to the original ones. Ive been waiting for the price of the HD DVD to drop down and i finally was able to get it for only $12.50 BRAND NEW. After watching it in HD, i totally would be willing to pay more for this movie. The detail is insane, just seeing the little dots on the turtles skin and how chrisp the picture looks, this has got to be one of the best HD DVDs out on the market. Its a must have for anyone who collects HD DVDs or for anyone who has little kids

1594489505|5.0|This is a great book and should be read by all teen and older children. It tells of the terrible abuse of power which exists in the world today. It will make all readers very thankful for the rule of law in our country which is in contrast to the rule of might which exists in Afganistan and other countries in the world. It also suggests that the abuse of women which is advocated in the name of religion is ever present in many countries in the Middle East. The notion that women are inferior or even to be considered as \\"property\\" must be changed or these countries will remain tribal and subject to political instability.

0670034711|1.0|not that my opinion matters because if you want to buy this book you will do so no matter what reviews you read. with that said i suggest checking this book out at your local library before you purchase it. if you can read the first 30 pages and actually find one redeeming quality then maybe this book is for you, however i will not share in that opinion. the author whines about how terrible her life is for the first half of the book and then the second half of the book, well i didn't get that far. that's how disturbed i was with her complaining (side note: all of her problems she was experiencing were self induced). maybe if the author wasn't so self absorbed the book would be palpable. all i have to say is \\"boo hoo. cry me a river so i can swim in your tears.\\"
0553213105|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I admit without pleasure that I am partial to romance novels from the same time period. I also admit that it was very refreshing to read a less formulaic and shallow, meaning more creative, intelligent and worthy book set in this time.<br />My favorite character must be Mrs. Bennet. Can anybody be more delusional, obnoxious and wacko? I laughed and cringed each time I heard her voice which I really did hear as I listened to the book on my mp3 player. And then there is Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine. Right at the beginning of the book she meets Mr. Darcy and it's dislike at first sight on both sides.<br />Since her sister and Darcy's best friend fall in love, Elizabeth has to encounter Mr. Darcy repeatedly. Other events force the two to meet again and again and Elizabeth almost laughs out loud when finally ... but I don't want to spoil your question of `what will happen if anything between Elizabeth and Darcy?'.<br />I really liked Elizabeth' character development. I admire her steadfastness and honesty.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The \\"Bourne Ultimatum\\" nicely completed the trilogy.  It was an action packed non-stop thrill.  Do appreciate when sequels keep the theme moving forward.  It could stand alone, but why should it.  See all three films.
0765318741|3.0|Not bad. Good story, good story telling, a consistent character, i.e. no let's make the end nice to please readers, and good tempo. If you like horror/vampire stories you may enjoy this book. There's very little interaction between the protagonist and the vampires beyond hiding from them at night and killing them when he finds them during the day. Mostly it's a portrait of this last living human and his struggles to live in a kind of self-imposed solitary confinement. I would be interested in a book about what happens next.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|This is absolutely the best cd of 2007. Phil's vocals are amazing. The lyrics are intense. The band is tight and right on. Every song on this CD is incredible. Can't wait to see it performed live.
B00005JPAD|2.0|I am not a fan of DiCaprio, but I have to admit he was good in this movie; Matt Damon was great as well, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg not so much.    I agree with the comment that there are some disturbing anti-black nuances at the start of the movie.    The script has so many holes that I do not know where to start.    The ending of the movie is pointless and begs a question; did Scorsese see this movie before he unleashed against the world?     Can someone please tell me why Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) kill Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) in the end? It can't be vengeance since he is apparently a mole. What happened to the yellow envelope given by Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) to the psychologist? How did the third mole know that Billy Costigan was the mole inside the mob and why didn't he tell Costello?     I agree that Scorsese made a couple of good movies, but it's been downhill since then.    I gave it two stars because I think that someone else may give it a single star and we can added it up.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|\\"Planet Earth\\" is one of the most amazing videos I have ever seen.  The cinamatography is absolutely beautiful. Each section shows animals   and nature in it's ever changing cycle.

Even the \\"Cave\\" section when you realize that the mountain of brown you're   looking at is bat dung!! It's all fantastic. From the oceans to the plains.  Bravo to all of those that put this incredible thing together.
1400032717|3.0|I thought this book was good, but found it very frustrating to read.  The author wrote it as if it were written by an autistic boy.  Therefore, the topics jumped around so much and didn't keep on track.  I kept getting irritating, thinking, \\"Just stick to the subject!\\"  However, I guess that is exactly what he was intending.
B000YENUI6|4.0|This is a vicious, foreboding, but eminently watchable movie not recommended for the faint of heart. I came away from it with the impression that London had been moved lock, stock, and barrel to Moscow, so Russian is the overall cast to the movie. It opens with a particularly violent murder in a barbershop (I was frankly amazed that the \\"victim\\" couldn't see it coming) and segues to a waifish young girl in obvious distress who wanders into a drugstore and subsequently collapses, losing her life immediately thereafter giving birth at a local hospital. (I put \\"victim\\" in quotes because it doesn't seem that anyone involved here is totally free of criminal intent, other than the young woman protagonist and her family.)<br /><br />Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife at the local hospital, is working when the young girl comes in, and she finds an instant affinity with the baby girl left motherless when the mother dies on the table. Anna takes the one object that can identify the dead girl - a diary - home to her curmudgeonly Russian uncle to translate. The uncle, offended that Anna should take something from the dead, drags his feet about translating, and to speed things up (the baby will soon be put in foster care if relatives can't be located) Anna takes the diary - by way of copy - to a nearby Russian restaurant to be translated by the owner, a seemingly charming and cultured older Russian gentleman. Unbeknownst to Anna, the restaurant is a front for the Russian mob, and the diary is a particularly condemning bit of evidence concerning sexual slavery of young Russian girls that Semyon - the proprietor and Mob boss - would very much like to get his hands on. Consequently, Anna, with the best of intentions, draws the attention of the Mob and is put in high peril.<br /><br />To give her credit, Anna senses from the start that these are not nice people. The restauranteur's driver is played with chilling authenticity by Viggo Mortensen, who did extensive research (including an independent trip to Russia) to get the part right. He is cold, calculating, economical in speech...and the only person who can hold Semyon's loose-cannon son Kirill in check. Kirill is the nominal superior to Nicolai, Viggo's character; but really it is Viggo who is in charge, at least of Kirill (played with manic perfection by Vincent Cassel).<br /><br />This was a dark, gripping movie about the ruthlessness of the Russian mob, with very graphic violence and rather startling full-frontal nudity in a public bath as Nicolai fights for his life with two thugs bent on killing him. There is a fascinating scene also where several Mob bosses convene in a wine cellar to view Nicolai's prison tattoos - a visual history of his criminal accomplishments - to decide on elevating him in rank.<br /><br />There is the suggestion in released trailers that there is, perhaps, a romantic connection between Nicolai and Anna; but while they do form a partnership of sorts, there is little of romance here. I thought Naomi Watts played a good role as a strong woman trying to do right and knowing she is up against very tough characters; Viggo Mortensen played his usual spot-on characterization of a man on the edge dependent on his own wits to survive.o Russia) to get the part right.

B000WZAE1I|3.0|I don't mind eccentric comic fantasy films like \\"Baron Munchausen\\".  I felt Stardust was trying to be the same way, but despite the star power, I just didn't feel the charm of this film.  The central story is centered aorund Yvaine and Tristan.  There are three other subplots:  Michelle Pfeiffer as the witch greedy for her youth,  the seventh son of the royal line trying to claim the throne,  and then there's Robert De Niro's fruity Capt Shakespeare.  Each has its own comical merit, but Michelle Pfeiffer clearly steals the show.  If your villainess outshines every one in the movie, including the Star, played by the dewey Claire Danes, then  it's harder to root for the good guy.    I can't say much for Charlie Cox.  He just did not look like or feel like hero material.  And that sad little battle he had with Michelle didn't really earn him his wings, in my opinion.  The star had to come to the rescue.  Blechh.     I will give the movie points for originality.  For the most part entertaining, but not a movie I would strongly identify with.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|The greatest challenge in putting together an animation film is capturing emotional states effectively.  This film does that extraordinarily well.  In scene after scene, the rich and vivid emotions of the characters is bigger than life.  This is a work done by absolute masters of the craft.  In my view, this film is a must-have.  I have to say that initially I was not particularly impressed with the concept of a rat as a cook, but this film has shown that any concept can become extraordinary in the right hands.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|I understand some people just don't \\"get\\" the Arcade Fire, and that's OK (maybe they will one day).  There is something very powerful & emotive about the lead vocalist akin to say, Jack White's type of howling. However, unlike the White Stripes, Arcade Fire have an amazing about of music going on besides the bluesy,  heartfelt lyrics and often it's done in a surprising way.   Almost what 3 or 4 years after this debut album was released and I still go back to several key songs over and over. I'm always interested in what this band is doing and I hope they keep progressing into new territory.

B0007TKNII|3.0|This is truly a classic, The photography was incredible the movie was written well. The mistakes made in the film very obvious!!! Yet you really don't mind seeing a string down Butlers neck and one eye one color one moment then another color later. You sort of overlook the imperfections and fall in love with the character Erik. Gerard Butler did an amazing job, yet I do think at times he needed work on developing his character better, He was all over the place at times. You can still hear the scottish accent the actor has. Yet his singing was unique and went well with the character. All in all well worth it and enjoyed every minute of it. Rossum was almost perfect but a bit too young. Minnie Driver I thought was terrible. The fainting scene in the carriage was not funny, it was truly a bad performance. The rest of the film was great.
B00004S3AN|5.0|Although I'm not what I consider to be a great fan of jazz, I have enjoyed Dave Brubeck's music for quite some time. For the last two and a half years or so, I have bought almost only high resolution music (DVD-A or SACD), and was determined to buy this disc soon. For a short while, several years ago, I owned the standard CD version of this album - until I donated it to my father-in-law. For anyone reading this reveiw, I can confirm that there is little comparison possible between the CD version of this album, and this SACD version. Please note; this is an SACD, and not an SACD hybrid. This means that a dedicated SACD player is required for playback, unlike the hybrid SACDs where at least the CD layer can be accessed with a standard CD player. If you have an SACD player, and a half-decent set of speakers, I can't imagine how anyone would fail to be impressed. The clarity of the recording, and it's 3-dimensionalism is amazing. It is really like having someone play in your living room. For those interested, this disc offers a stereo and a 5.1 audio option, and comes packaged in a \\"standard CD\\" jewel case - unlike many SACDs which come in so-called \\"Super Jewel Boxes\\". My universal disc player is set to default to multi-channel playback wherever possible on SACDs or DVD-A, and I have therefore not listened to this disc in stereo. The multi-channel mix though is very subtle, and most of the sound comes from the front speakers, leaving the rear speakers to help create a surround effect. This works perfectly well on this disc, and I coudn't imagine how it would work any other way.     If you like Dave Brubeck and have an HD audio player, go out an buy this album. If you don't yet own an HD audio player, go out and buy one! It's high time that the standard CD hurried up and died, and made way for music only on the hi-res formats such as SACD or DVD-A!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|If you want a story of a timeless romance that captures your heart just watch this. The breath taking photography will leave you stunned and your mouth agape staring at this movie. The acting is not bad, I much preferred the original with Colin Firth. Yet when you watch this version of P&P you become glued to your set. Definately worth your time.
1878424114|4.0|I was introduced to this book at age 16, and only read half of it before I had to give it back a year later (it was borrowed). I knew I was reading something very powerful, but the reason I didn't finish reading it is because I found it to be a hard read at the time. I thought I would pick it up again when I had a little more life and educational experience behind me.  So I decided to order it after I noticed it on a shelf in a book store a couple of months ago. I realize now that the way the author words his sentences is what makes this book a hard read in certain passages. However, now that I have read the book, my only regret is that I didn't finish reading it earlier. It isn't the only book one should read on success, but the principles in this book will generate residuals for a lifetime.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|Very interesting to watch and it does show you a side of arnold you wanted to know about.
0060594888|5.0|In this book, Jack Canfield introduced me to many new ideas and concepts, and reintroduced me to ones I thought I knew. The read was very easy, entertaining, and educational. I do not expect to master all these principles within a read or two, or even a year or two. But I know that my level of success is in direct proportion to my ability to integrate these principles to my life and make them an everyday habit. Great book! (I'm glad I bought the hard cover.)
B000BBOUU4|1.0|Don't do it. You still have that image of Gene Wilder as a kid playing Willy Wonka? Well dont spoil it. Johnny Depp played the role....a bit weird. I mean it is scary. Dont waste your time and spoil those wonderful memories. This may leave you having nightmares.
B000VR824S|5.0|The two disks of the DVD contain a wealth of extraordinary  guitar playing.  Many guitarists from the 2004 DVD are included,  like Robert Cray, Doyle Bromhall, B.B. King, John McLaughlin,   Robert Randolph, John Mayer, Hubert Sumlin, Buddy Guy, Los Lobos,   Jimmy Vaughan, and Vince Gill (and of course, Eric Clapton).    Several guitarists appear on the 2007 DVD that weren't on the   2004 DVD, like Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Jeff Beck, Steve   Winwood, Sonny Landreth, Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson, all   welcome additions.  A few guitarists, like Joe Walsh, James   Taylor, Steve Vai, ZZ Top, J.J. Cale and Carlos Santana from   the 2004 DVD don't appear on the 2007 DVD, but this is probably   due the way the two events were scheduled.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|The amazing aspect of this story is that the dialogue centers upon two characters Vincent and Max inside a taxi cab. What begins as a simple car fare for the taxi driver turns into a high-tension dialogue as the cabbie witnesses a murder committed by his passenger. Max played by Jamie Foxx is then coerced into participating in the murders. Collateral as a story works because of the ensuing dialogue, which takes place after this point.     The cab in this story is a far cry from the couch in a psychologist's office, but some of the dynamics are present. At this point the character of Vincent knows that he can disclose his thoughts and takes on life in complete confidentiality and safety as a client in receiving psychological therapy; as he is assured that the conversation will go no further than the cab as he can kill Max when he has outlived his usefulness, Vincent discloses his nihilistic philosophy without reservation, which belittles the value of human life, and also shows his rationalization for his own existence and his profession. Questions are posed to Vincent by Max, who is subjugated to not only to listen to this bizarre worldview, but witnesses it being carried out as Vincent fulfills his contractual obligations. Max's questions are answered in a cold, logical fashion, which are hard for Max to refute upon first hearing them. Vincent's answers are so well-thought out that one has to wonder if Vincent's has already presented such reasons in conversations with others in the past or that he had to convince himself first that this is how his world works.     A shift in this story takes place in Max's personality as he is coerced into certain potentially dangerous situations. Max is forced to adopt Vincent's mindset if he is to survive these situations and it is eye-opening to see that character change in the cab driver. Throughout the façade of their relationship Vincent is complete control of Max, until Max applies such nihilism directly upon Vincent.     Michael Mann does an excellent job with this character-driven movie. His commentary provides further insight into the character's background, but also focuses on Tom Cruise's training and development of Vincent's character. Jamie Foxx performs amazingly as Max. Smaller but no less potent was Mark Ruffalo's impressive character of Detective Fanning.  Very cool, dedicated and sharp, my wish is that Fanning's character would have played more of a dominant role in the story. However, Michael Mann uses Fanning as the catalyst for Max's own catharsis. Altogether the movie is filled with interesting characters, insights, and entertainment.
0810993139|1.0|After a fabulous experience with the graphic novel American Born Chinese, our book club of 6th grade girls and their moms was sorely disappointed in Diary of a Wimpy Kid. The author misses several opportunities to weave together disparate events into a meaningful plot. The writing is boring, the characters are barely even one-dimensional, and the humor is obviously written by someone who is not current in middle school dynamics.     This one is one to let remain on the library shelf.

B00005JL0I|3.0|With the success of the 21st Bond movie - Casino Royale, starring Daniel Craig, a new, younger audience will come across this 1967 version, a parody of the James Bond movies.    On paper this Casino Royale should have been the best comedy ever made. With a line up with the likes of Peter Sellers, David Niven, Woody Allen, and Orson Welles, it is almost a crime that Casino Royale was such a critical disappointment.     Five directors and as many writers has done untold damage to the structure of the movie, with some parts so obviously dire and tired, whilst some parts funny and stylish. For example, the beginning, where David Niven is held up in a Scottish castle of beauties, is mainly slapstick stuff, whilst the Peter Seller's parts are quite witty and more script orientated. The stuff with Sellers and Woody Allen are great but it is lost in reels and reels of bloated directionless action.     You can tell that this movie is composed of three stories spliced together in a sort of desperate attempt of actually finishing something that most of the crew and cast probably regretted starting in the first place.    Some of the dream sequences seem to be `proper' scenes that have been edited out and placed back in. The film reminds me of the last Peter Seller's Pink Panther movie, where unfinished scenes and old scenes are spliced together to form sort of story. But it fails, and the actual story structure of Flemming's Casino Royale is lost in the broth of too many cooks.    Orson Welles, who plays the initial baddie, Le Chiffre, is always a enjoy to watch but it is sad to see him take these type of roles, especially in a mess like this, which is a shame as he would have made a proper Bond Villain, tormenting Sean Connery with wit and quips before enduring him to an elaborate death, which of course doesn't succeed.     David Niven plays David Niven of course, which is weird as he was originally one of the famous actors reportedly put forward to play the real Bond before unknown Sean Connery got the role. In this context, it seems Niven got the booby prize.     Peter Sellers is on fine form, but his role is lost here and there in between bloated long scenes that do not involve him, nor really pull the plot along. Woody Allen shows us his original slapstick and his more surreal humour, long before his more intellectual efforts in years to come. His Jimmy Bond is typical Allen, self-deprecating and self-loathing; not being able to fulfill the respect of his more famous uncle, Niven's James Bond.    The saving grace for the film actually belongs to Burt Bacharach; his score is typical sixties, fun and colourful.    All in all this film is not great, but serves as an odd nostalgia of many talents from both sides of the pond playing on screen together. Others include William Holden, Deborah Kerr and Daliah Lavi.    The film could have benefitted enormously from having just one director to keep the comedy in check and to create a better continuity balance. The film would have been great with a director like Mel Brookes, a great comedy film director and king of parody.    I would recommend this film to fans of Austin Powers rather than James Bond. The music, camp colours and sets, and the bevy of sixties girls, the giant UFO and the `evil' plot all precede the similar Mike Myer's creation 30 years later.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|This is a beautiful addition to any music collection, & even more to your Christmas music collection. Diana Krall is Christmas, in December & in July! If you like her music, this is just another \\"Klassic Krall\\" in my opinion, you'll be very happy with this purchase! I love it, I love it!!
B000002KDS|5.0|This is a must have item for anyone that takes rock seriously. I am between the people that had the opportunity of listening to this album since it was released in 1971 and called my attention since the very first time.  And this is one the best things that can be said about this album. After all, it survived the test of time. Now, 37 years after, the majority of productions from that time looks outdated, but not this one.  It is a sequence of hits, unforgettable riffs, too much creativity, it never turns annoying.  Listening to it after all this years and thousands of times, I guess that, perhaps, some sequences should be shortened of softened, but, again, it's a 37 years old record showing that good things last forever.  I strongly recommend this album for anyone looking for the best of the 70's, an album that showed the path to several groups still to come at that time.  Good work, Alice! You'll live forever through this.
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|Im not going to lie, I wasn't really into all the other Die Hards except for the first one. But this one is really good. Alot of action and things blowing up. Lots of shooting and has a good mix of comedy in there. Ha really nice move, a must own on Blu-Ray
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive at just how much better the picture could be with this series on HD-DVD, over the standard Cable HD broadcast, WOW.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|Okay, so there are a million reviews for London Calling and I admit that my opinion is not in any way vital in relation to its popularity, but I pen this in the hope that some young kid--with no cultural memory of The Clash--will come across these words and be persuaded to download some of these songs or buy it in its entirety. London Calling is a work of art whose tracks are unique, transcendent, joyous, and alive. I'm not over-praising it or descending into hyperbole. I'm just being honest.<br /><br />I came to the album late in life. When I was a boy the only thing I knew by The Clash was Rock the Casbah (sad but true). After college I heard about the CD by word of mouth and picked up a copy in 1996. I still listen to it today. The sound remains fresh. Out of the 19 tracks, \\"London Calling, Train in Vain, Rudie Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Lost in the Supermarket,\\" and \\"Death or Glory\\" are my personal favorites. However, I must point out that there is not a bad song anywhere on the CD. How many releases can you say that about nowadays?
B000F3A7LE|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Maybe the only proper studio album by Robert Fripp, the music is'nt just explorative and different even from his King Crimson first period (at this time they were splitted), it blends into such a beautiful, brutal and sincere forms of his music that it definitively expose his soul, that the album works out more as a compilation of his greatest works than a simple studio recording.<br /><br />Having a flawless production, and a number of delightful collaborators (Daryl Hall, Peter Hammill, Brian Eno, among others), the music here expands into any form of enjoyable aspects, not only for rock standards, but for a delicate quantity of genres and sub-genres that appeal perfectly to any public, including commercial, more pop-oriented pieces (\\"You Burn Me Up I'm A Cigarette\\", which sounds as Elton John, \\"North Star\\", which is a concrete mix of \\"Matte Kudasai\\" with \\"Two Hands\\", \\"Chicago\\", \\"Mary\\" and Peter Gabriel's rendition to \\"Here Comes The Flood\\" in a less overproduced way), heavy, dark, complex but freewilling material (\\"Breathless\\", \\"Disengage\\", \\"Exposure\\" \\"I May Not Have Had Enough Of Me But I've Had Enough Of You\\"), tune-deaf, bordering from insane but delightful and interesting works (\\"NY3\\", \\"H&auml;aden Two\\", \\"Water Music I\\") and his more personal and difficult side which goes into his ambient/experimental style with his always promoting frippertronics (\\"Urban Landscape\\", \\"First Inaugural Adress To The I.A.C.E. Sherborne House\\", \\"Water Music II\\"). But the best part of it is that the music gets as wide and imaginative as public-oriented and compelling, the result of his trip to Hell's Kitchen, NY which got into himself to produce music that kisses streets and urbanism of the hughe NY, and also because he notices it on the linner notes, claiming that he was really dissapointed with record companies commercialism.<br /><br />The material comes in form of a mini LP with its booklet, lyrics, linner notes and the album making diary, it comes with two cds, the first one is the first edition of the album and the second one is the third edition of the album with bonus tracks featuring the unreleased vocals by Daryl Hall, so, the perfect album, the perfect material, two editions so you don't complain about sound quality, what else you could ask for?cds, the first one is the first edition of the album and the second one is the third edition of the album with bonus tracks featuring the unreleased vocals by Daryl Hall, so, the perfect album, the perfect material, two editions so you don't complain about sound quality, what else you could ask for?
B0000028MA|5.0|Although Singles was great as a film. It possesses one of the few soundtracks that you immediately notice independent of the action onscreen. I bought the CD way back in 1992 and still listen to it today. The songs \\"Would\\" brought Alice in Chains to my attention, and, even though I was always a Replacements fan, it was not until I heard \\"Dyslexic Heart\\" and \\"Waiting for Somebody\\" that I realized just how strong Paul Westerberg is on his own. The Hendrix track, \\"May This Be Love,\\" is a standout as is Pearl Jam's \\"State of Love and Trust.\\" \\"Nearly Lost You\\" is a song that introduced me to the Screaming Trees who I had never listened to before buying this compilation. These are the types of powerful tunes that can be enjoyed at the gym or on the road.
B00005RHGL|5.0|My husband & I love good westerns, & this is one of our favorites. I highly recommend this DVD. There are even a few added scenes in this director's cut that make the movie more complete than the original, which left you guessing as to what happened to a few of the characters. The whole cast is excellent, & Val Kilmer as Doc is superb and unforgettable.
B000YENUI6|1.0|Save your money & wait for this on a movie channel. The ending is a real non-ending. There is some good action in a public bacth.
B000001FY9|4.0|It's kind of sad that Bob Marley, one of the greatest artists ever, is best known for a compilation, but hey, it's a well-made one. With a couple exceptions, that is. A few of Bob's classic songs were left off - there's no \\"Concrete Jungle\\", no \\"Lively Up Yourself\\", no \\"Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)\\", no \\"Roots, Rock, Reggae\\", no \\"Sun is Shining\\", no \\"Coming in from the Cold\\". It's a shame that the recent two-disc \\"expanded edition\\" missed a chance to rectify most of those omissions (though it does include \\"Lovely Up Yourself\\"), instead offering a pile of remixes.<br />By the same token, most the rest offers you the REST of his best-known material, though it does sadly deemphasize Bob's influential early years - one track comes from Catch a Fire (\\"Stir It Up\\"), two from Burnin' (\\"I Shot the Sheriff\\"; \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\"), zero from Natty Dread. Other albums that get totally shafted are Rastaman Vibration and Survival.<br />However, those looking for all of Bob's best-known hits, from \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" to \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" to \\"Jammin'\\" to \\"Exodus\\" to \\"Redemption Song\\". And there isn't a single bad track out of these fourteen. Nothing I'd like to toss out. So if you're new to Marley, start with it, but don't stop there!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|LOST is definitely the best, more original series on television. This 3rd Season DVD collection really helps tie up some loose ends. Watching the episodes back to back helps you pick up on things you might have missed watching the series weekly on tv. Can't wait for Season 4 to start!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This was another hit in my collection, this was to me \\"The Feel Good Movie of 2003\\" Tim Burton directed a Masterpiece.  Everything in this movie had a positive constant flow.  Strong Story, Music to match the mood, everything was perfect.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|OMG...probably the best CD I have ever heard..it is something old and something new..I am not a lover of Jazz but she has sold me on her soulful and bluesey voice.  I find this CD downright sexy.  Call me crazy but I do relate it to a female Barry White.  Her music evokes passion. After hearing what an amazing artist she is I am dying to see her in concert. I hope she comes back to amaze us with her talent and does not just leave us with a tragic legacy.
B000T1D9KS|4.0|I saw the BBC production of her Live in London on RAVE networks and it was terrific,  Not only is she cute, she is a very accomplished songstress with a dynamic and sultry voice.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|I picked up this movie after having seen several reviews praising this the \\"best sci-fi movie in years\\"-- see the glowing reviews on Amazon, for example.      Now I'm not one to be overly offended if a movie takes some liberties with science and logic in order to tell a compelling story.  There's plenty of sci-fi movies that do so that nevertheless still rock (Terminator movies, for example).  However, this movie just hurt the brain to watch.    Why? Well, basically, it seems like everything on this all-important earth saving mission was apparently designed for absolute failure.  Let's look at what we have here:    1. No redundant systems to produce vitally needed oxygen?  Check  2. A liquid nitrogen cooled, giant centralized mainframe computer that can only be fixed by having a person dive into the frigid certain-death to save the day?  Check  3. Only enough space suits for one of us?  Check  4. Emergency buttons have cases that must be tediously unscrewed in the middle of an emergency?  Check  5. Allow for completely unfiltered sunlight to come through a \\"viewing\\" room, instantly scorching the occupants?  Check  6. Let's just send one person who actually can deploy the life-saving nukes, and if he dies, we're all screwed! Check  7. Oh, and let's just forget about the fact that you could have just sent a robotic mission to complete the mission with far less possibility of complications!  Check  8. And for even more fun, let's send a Christian fundamentalist who turns into a bloodthirsty space zombie in the process! Check!     Folks, the movie is just plain dumb.  It's pretty, but it's too silly, rife with cheap and overly predictable \\"twists\\" while being shrouded in a pretentious veil of what passes to most to be \\"science.\\"  IMHO
B000VWYNNW|1.0|Unlike the others here, I am not a Led Zeppelin fanatic. They did much great music, from the beggining through \\"Houses of the Holy,\\" but this live album is cacaphonous and lacks energy. But \\"How the West Was Won\\" is excellent and much better than this.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|This film has captivated me since I first watched it on VHS years ago. Since then I went to the theaters and saw it on the big screen when the director's cut was released. Ridley Scott is truly an amazing director in every sense. This film plays with your emotions, the imagery spellbinding, and the soundtrack transcends and compliments perfectly the cinematography. I think you either can appreciate this for an incredible work of art in many respects or it's lost on you. So be it.<br /><br />I can understand how many people find the film confusing and the pacing rather stifling. It's a slow moving, rather heady movie. But I think what makes people think this way is that they're used to sci-fi being action-packed and not too much to think about. Both of these established trends in sci-fi movies run counter to Blade Runner.<br /><br />On to the HD version. Well, I can tell you that this DVD set is what pushed me over into buying into the HD format wars. I think the HD format wars are incredibly stupid and I can't believe this sort of thing is allowed to go on in the world still. Decided and standard media and content formats makes total sense. And having two HD formats to confuse and split the HD market doesn't really help make HD mainstream. I really wish some consumer group would step in and say we only get one. Can you imagine if we had two CD formats to deal with? I know competition is good but when it comes to standard media and content formats, it often becomes a setback to me.  With all that being said, I now own a HD TV and really want to take advantage of it.<br /><br />So I opted for the HD-DVD format since players still tend to be cheaper and the 10 DVD was too much for me to pass up. Plus I just went through a horrible year with Sony and their incredibly awful customer support that I've sworn off Sony products in our house. It's funny since from what I read HD-DVD usually offers more features than their Blue-Ray versions. Reminds me how Betamax was truly superior but that didn't matter in the long run, did it? Sure, one of these HD formats will become the Betamax of this decade but I didn't want to hold out any longer. I don't plan on buying too many DVDs but rather rent them from Netflix when I want to see a movie in HD.<br /><br />Now on to the DVD set itself. The Final Cut is well done and the HD transfer is incredible. When the opening scene shows up on your HD set, it's really one of those \\"Wow\\" moments. The Final Cut definitely feels the tightest of the versions, clocking in just shy of 2 hours. But I think I miss some of the scenes I'm used to seeing in the Director's Cut. But that's okay since this collection has every version for your viewing pleasure. As another reviewer mentions, the Dangerous Days feature is enough to make this collection worthwhile. It's an amazing documentary for anyone the least bit interested in what went into making this landmark film.<br /><br />So for any Blade Runner fan, this is an obvious must-have. If you've appreciated the film in the past, you'll fall in love with it all over again watching it in this collection. If you like Blade Runner but not a huge fan, I would suggest getting just the 2 disc version since it has The Final Cut and Dangerous Days. The two best parts of this collection that I can say so far. I haven't had a chance to dig into the fourth disc with all the extras and deleted scenes, but I'm guessing this is hard-core fan material anyways.perior but that didn't matter in the long run, did it?

B000069KE0|5.0|One should listen to this beginning to end without interruption. Very finely done musically, high energy, one of my favorites; certainly better than the good first album Chicago Transit Authority.
B0010X8NF0|2.0|Generally being a fan of Wes Anderson's prior films, I certainly entered this film not wanting to dislike it.  But in contrast to his other films such as the Royal Tenenbaums or even Rushmore, The Darjeeling Limited simply possesses too many overt flaws for me to be its champion.  The film tracks the \\"journey\\" of three brothers across India, aboard a train.  That's probably as far as this film takes you in the way of a story arc.  We know virtually nothing about their past whatsoever, other than the fact that they have been estranged and each have relationship problems of some undefined nature.  As a testament to this conspicuous lack of character development, we are privy to an excruciatingly uninformative 10 minute flashback that reveals absolutely nothing about the characters, except that they missed their father's funeral while in-fighting about the prospect of salvaging a damaged car from a repair shop.  Like many of the chosen scenes in this film, you get the sense that cinematic opportunities and provacative story elements were squandered for no objective reason.  For example, their mother, played by Anjelica Huston, is portrayed as absent and estranged from her children in some rustic convent, and we are given virtually no explanation for her alienating behavior (either past or present).  Furthermore, the brothers find themselves the sudden guests of a rural family after Adrian Brody attempts to save a young boy from drowning in a river.  Nothing becomes of this, other than the brothers attending a rural funeral, and we're left with a sense that this sequence is being inserted -- rather obviously and uninterestingly, to boot -- into the story in order to imbue the characters with some \\"powerful\\" spiritual epiphany.  In the end, unfortunately, these characters are inescapably one dimensional, as compared to many of the Wes Anderson heroes that we have met in the past (i.e., Royal Tenenbaum and Max Fisher).  This film feels more like a last minute artistic light bulb that flashed in the minds of Roman Coppola, Wes Anderson, and Jason Schwartzman as they were flying back from the Far East.  They probably had a wonderful trip to India and felt that they could fashion something amazingly evocative and artistic from their exploits.  Unfortunately, it feels more self-indulgent, than meaningful, and honestly feels that they wrote the script in about 2 hours and didn't really care about developing it further.  Perhaps Wes Anderson has reached a point in his career where he can assemble sprawling scenes with manufactured bits of ambiguity, and rest upon his former laurels to deem his current work \\"brilliant.\\"  But in the grand scheme of Anderson's cinematic canon, this film falls towards the lower ranks.
1594489505|5.0|Better than the first one \\"The Kite Runner\\".  Once you start you can't put it down. Very informative about a country of which we know little. The malice of the Taliban is just incredible.
0143038419|1.0|...Well, I was advised to read Eat, Pray and Love over the Holidays. I was thrilled to hear it was a national best seller...that is, until I reached a third of the book.  I couldn't understand what the \\"all consuming crying\\" was all about. While living a life most people dream of, traveling to exotic lands, eating foods unknown to 99% of the world's population, and about as care free as you can imagine, what's the problem? No responsibilities beyond which musuem she's going to and how many hours she can pray, her incessant self-absorbtion was unbearable!       My way of learning is to gain great knowledge and wisdom from the greatest teachers, of which she is not. I place her on the very bottom of the list of people I'd like to learn from. Not recommended at all!!
B000WTZ784|4.0|In my opinion this is the best Genesis album in some time.  It is not too pop, what with Phil not writing any of the songs, and is just more consistent than they have been since Trick of the Tail and their self-titled album.  Rutherford & Banks' songwriting skills are not to be dismissed, they were obviously the talent behind Genesis's non-pop songs of the post-Gabriel (& Hackett) era.  Ray Wilson's slightly gravely voice goes well with the lush sounds behind most of these songs; I really can't imagine Phil singing these songs (nor Ray singing most of the songs from before this album).  If you like Genesis mostly for their more interesting and intricate songs rather than their pop hits (most of which I do like), give this a try.  This is based on the original 1997 release of this album.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I would question anyone who didn't appreciate Sarah. That being said, I showed up at a friend's place for a Christmas party, and when she pulled out the Wintersong CD, I found myself cringing, thinking that it might be a tacky sell-out album (there are so damned many of those!). Truth be told, we played it over and over and over. It is absolutely gorgeous and captures the winter season without getting redundant and ridiculously \\"Christmasy.\\"<br />This is a great album. Toss the Burl Ives!
0385341067|4.0|This book is an extraordinary study in the power of language and narrative. It's about the way Stories (practical, imaginative or brutally true) become the fabric of our lives. Very simply told, it contains subtle layers of meaning -- and I don't think Great Expectations is absolutely necessary to read beforehand, though of course it will add much to one's enjoyment of this book. I read Mister Pip, thinking it would be more simple-minded -- but instead it really shocked me with its depth and beauty.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I bought this for my 9 year old, but the whole family enjoys playing it!  The rules are simple (it is for 5+ years)so learning how to play is quick.  The games are relatively short (usually less than 30 minutes) which is ideal for busy parents - it is so easy to fit it into a busy schedule.  I see the educational value in it - but my children just think it is fun.  I look forward to playing the other versions!
B000FIMG68|4.0|I haven't missed an episode and found Season 2 as engaging as Season 1.  The only reason for a 4 star rating as opposed to a 5 is because I don't particularly care for some of the plots surrounding the \\"others\\".  While the writers have a number of great ideas, the inclusion of this bit of oddity brings a bit of unrealism to an otherwise believable adventure.  Despite my less than enthusiastic feelings about this story line, I really enjoy the majority of the series and look forward to unwrapping Season 3!!
0143038419|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is delightful reading being both insightful and fun. (YES, FUN! Made me LOL many times!) Ms. Gilbert is a breath of fresh air, down-to-earth, honest, and does not claim to be a substitute for your doctor or guru. Great read! Highly recommended!
0061122416|5.0|I've read this book twice already, sensing after the first time that I may have missed some things.  And indeed I had missed some of the points.  I plan to read it again, just in case I didn't get it all the second time.      It is a precious book to me, and I'm beginning to see connections in my daily life that I learned to recognize and understand as I made my way through \\"The Alchemist (Plus)\\"    I vow to read it at least one more time.....and probably more!!!
0805079831|5.0|Theres no doubt that the basic premise of this book is true.  However we  in the U.S. also get bamboozled so to speak by our own dire consequences.  Consider that because of our subprime crisis, and the woes at Citigroup, that the sovereign investment authorities in the Middle East (Abu Dhabi) are now taking huge stakes in our banking and brokerage companies.  Moral:  That those who promulgate economic systems that are not fundamentally sound, will get infiltrated or bought out by entities they would rather not do business with otherwise.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I just received V as a gift. Reading some of the reviews here - didn't have a chance to read them all - it amazes me how any viewer can take a movie based on a comic book so personally. I just wanted to chime in with a thumbs up based purely on the level of entertainment. It's an interesting and really well done film and Natalie Portman delivers a great performance. If you want to talk conspiracy theories, check out these links and tell me it is just a coincidence. Put this cover [[ASIN:6305182493 The Mask of Zorro]] under this cover [[ASIN:B000254XO2 In the Zone]] and what do you get? Evey is Britney and V is Z. The filmmakers want us all to shave our heads. That's the conspiracy.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Fabulous!! Find a restroom before you start, have your snacks and drinks near your chair, push play and hang on! The action sequences are flawless, amazing and believable. There's a slightly less engaging story line to this one, but the movie pulls you along so quickly you don't notice until the end of the movie when you finally lean back in your chair and reflect upon what you'd just witnessed. There were a few plot points I wished they'd developed more, but if this means there's another one coming, I just hope this episode made enough money that they're putting it in the next movie.<br />I watched it 3 times in a row in the first two days we had it! Now I think I'll start with the first one and watch all three.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I thought I could save a few bucks by buying some non-Canon brand \\"similar\\" batteries.  Although they hold charged very well, they don't last as long as the original Canon BP-511A.  Spend a little extra and get what Canon designed for their cameras....not what other knock-offs attempted to.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|I've been a Springsteen fan ever since I first saw him perform at the Capitol Theater in Passaic, New Jersey in early 1974.  I have most of his recorded material.  This cd could be vastly improved with some simple editing.  There are, in my opinion, three or four weak tracks on this record that should have been removed altogether and the title song should appear as the last cut on the record.  Maybe I'll burn my own version of this cd.  But Bruce used to be so discriminating about his work, so perfectionistic, I truly wonder what is happening here.  I have similar issues with The Rising and I wonder how much of this has to do with his new Producer.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Avoid the theatrical version at all costs.  This Director's Cut is a superior film in every way.  I'm a fan of Scott's epic storytelling, but this movie is the best so far.  I believe it compares quite well with the epic films of the past--including Ben Hur, Spartacus, and even Lawrence Of Arabia.  If you have problems with battle gore, you WILL have some issues, but otherwise this is a wonderful movie.
0316236535|5.0|My five-year-old loves this book.  He is at the stage where he is starting to read on his own and this book is perfect for that.  It is also visually stimulating and helps with his nighttime fears.  He will read it over and over and then ask me to read it to him!  Great book!
B000Y179KO|3.0|Great CD. Probably one of the slowest sellers when it comes to shipping and the timing of receiving the product. I received it on time, but it was very close, especially with x-mas close by. The item was in excellent condition when I received it.
B00007KWHG|5.0|What a fun-filled CD to listen to!  It brings back such great memories and the CD is so well done.  The tunes are fabulous!  Truly a joy!
B000UNYJV8|4.0|The violence at first evoked memories of A Clockwork Orange.  I am tempted to label it as nihilism, but these losers believe in some kind of neo-British purity, trying to recapture the global prominence which Britain once enjoyed.  To do so, they must terrorize various immigrants who they do not feel are worthy.      You almost get a sense of how Nazism may have taken hold of Germany in the 1920's and 1930's.      Worth seeing, but it's one of those films I could not exactly call an \\"enjoyable\\" movie experience.      If this IS England, I'll pass ....
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This DVD is absolutely amazing.  I don't think I will ever tire from watching the magnificent life and cinematography.  Absolutely incredible.  Reminds you that the world we live in is beautiful-we just need to learn to revere it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This DVD Series is so well done that my husband and I can't wait to see the rest.  (We have part 10 to go.)  We are actually sad that it is soon over as we have experienced many different emotions as we have watched it.  Some adjectives that describe it are: Exciting, Suspenseful, Thrilling, Scary, Meaningful, Sad, Compelling...and we love it!  Band of Brothers helps you understand the sacrifices that our service men made and currently make for our freedom and the freedom of others.
1594489505|5.0|It is tough to follow up the kite runner, but this book did a great job...although i enjoyed Kite Runner much more, this book as a stand alone is a great work.  i would recommend you read this book before Kite Runner if you can...you'll enjoy both books a lot more by doing so..
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|This was a college graduation gift for my daughter's boyfriend.  He absolutely loved the watch and thought it looked very classy.  You can't go wrong with a Skagen watch.  They are affordable and look like they cost more than they actually do.  I like them so much that everyone in the family has a Skagen.  Many nice comments from people too.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Would you believe there are only 12 episodes? This means you can buy the complete series in a convenient little packet of 3 DVDs, 6 hours, and just enjoy them again and again. And you will. It's positively brilliant. Every actor but one is imminently skillful and every script but one will make you laugh out loud, hard. Hit \\"pause\\" until it passes. I hope you can cope with the workplace stress, which it will remind you of. I left the workplace long ago and it gives me flashbacks. And damn, I wish I could be as thin as John Cleese. Instead, I have hair like Prunella Scales, and I happen to be proud of it. And that's a cool name for an actress, isn't it? Prunella Scales.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I upgraded to these from a pair of AKG K66's which had come with a very strong recommendation from a friend.  Frankly, I was dissatisfied with the 66's for what I considered an overall lack of fidelity, although the bass was decent.  These on the other hand are everything the 66's were not.  They are clear, crisp, incredible.  The 66's were extremely comfortable and I was concerned about these, but those concerns were laid to rest as the K240's feature a similar head-strap with auto-fitting action (never going back to having to adjust headphones to go on my head) and I'd actually consider these more comfortable, as the strap is made from a softer material.  They have a different dynamic than the 66's, less Bass heavy, which actually provides what I'd consider a more natural sound.  I wear them all day every day at work, and I could not be happier.
0385333846|5.0|Lemme guess. You read it, you loved it, you say good things about it, and it's been so long since you actually read it that you can't remember it. Guess what? It's still a classic. Thoughtful, humorous, clear-eyed, moving, powerful, unique, brilliantly conceived and executed. He was a master of character, plot, pacing, and language. It's amazing to think that he wrote this about 40 years ago. I bought mine, but you can probably go to the library. You will thank me.
B000J103PC|1.0|Although potentially well acted and with the potential to have a good message there are major problems with this movie. Firstly, was it necessary for the main character to compromise not only her integrity but her base moral ideals to become successful? She did it. She turned her back on all that she once believed and became all that she was expected to by the fashion world. She gloats about her losing weight to fit into smaller sizes when she was beautiful the way she was. This sends a horrible message to the young girls of the world. Anne Hathaway in this movie turns from a well educated well grounded woman to a fashion obsessed, weight obsessed, success obsessed woman. She sleeps with a man in a terrible \\"one night stand\\" and turns her back on her boyfriend and close friends. And for all of this she is taken back in the end. He should have told her to get away and enjoy the new life she has created for herself. She gave up who she was to become some one else and only succeeded in making herself ugly.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|if you like the beatles, i can't see you not liking this CD. it's just a remix of your old favorites. instead of separate songs, they blend into each other. it's the same wonderful music, the same psychedelic sounds, and it's blended by the same wizard engineer george martin that mixed the original albums. it's not exactly a \\"greatest hits\\" because the music's been fiddled with; sometimes 2 or 3 songs will be layered on top of one another for a few seconds before one prevails. and that trio is introduced by a group of exotic sounds from a different song. it's fun, it's creative, and remixing usually adds rather than detracts from the original music.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Great service from Amazon, this product arrived in great shape after about a week of shipping via USPS to my FPO address.  What a shame this series was cancelled.  The characters, dialogue, and story arcs were even better than I remembered.  I also liked the college setting better than high school, especially using the characters from the criminology class.  I was disappointed that \\"Weevil's\\" character has been emasculated so badly this season.  Overall, very pleased with the product.  Be careful though when watching.  It took me about 6 episodes to realize that when I skipped ahead through the opening credits that I was skipping about 10 minutes of the episode as well!  Better to use fast forward than skip the whole scene as I was doing initially.
B000AARKOO|4.0|The Crusades was no place for sissies.  Early scenes of this film contain some of the most brutal battle action I have seen. Kingdom of Heaven follows Balian, a mostly unlikeable antihero (Orlando Bloom) who goes to Jerusalem at the behest of his dying father, (Liam Neeson) whom Balian never knew.  His father was a powerful man, and he asks his son to protect the innocent Muslims who will die if a certain Knight Templar takes power in the holy city.  Bloom seems miscast physically as the sword hefting and swinging required to survive seems to need much more physical bulk.  Nor does Bloom's warm, sexy, engaging personality shine through this particular character, either.<br /><br />But overall, the film brilliantly explores the root of Muslim-Christian antagonism, the result of which we are seeing today in the same Holy Land, now called the Middle East.  Recommended.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I bought this series as a Christmas present for my daughter.  It was an excellent buy.  I saved a lot of money and it was shipped quickly and in excellent condition.  I will recommend Amazon to everyone.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|Stardust is a wonderful, rich, fantasy film for adults.  Michelle Pfeiffer is stunning as the wicked Dark Witch who seeks to find a fallen star (Claire Danes) and cut her glowing heart out of her chest, which will restore her beauty and bestow long life.<br /><br />The star has fallen to Earth as a result of accidentally being knocked out of the sky by a ruby necklace.  The necklace is sought by evil, backstabbing (literally) brothers.  Whoever finds the necklace will inherit the magical kingdom of Stormhold.<br /><br />A young man, smitten by the local beauty, sees the falling star and pledges to bring it back to prove his love.  Unaware of the nature of the star, as well as his own heritage, he is soon on a quest to save the star from the forces who would kill her in a particularly despicable way.<br /><br />The movie has sex, murder, violence, so is not for kids.  Must-see.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Music is great!  Can't wait for Amazon to send me the movie when it comes out!
1400095204|5.0|real insight into the whole ghastly mess that was Biafra-powerfully written-makes one ashamed of our indifference and ignorance of human suffering and heroism.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Without a doubt, this is a series that everyone should see. The photography is beautiful and amazing. The \\"behind the scenes\\" bits really lets you know how difficult it is to get some of this amazing footage. A series you will watch again and again. Probably one of the best ways to encourage conservation without preaching for anyone. Makes a wonderful gift.
B000IOM0X8|5.0|Excellent movie.  I intend to purchase any Blu-Ray DVDs on Blu-Ray.com simply because they are extremely less expensive than anyof the reatail stores.  I have bought 8 DVDs so far with absolutely no problems.
B000E5KOJS|5.0|[[ASIN:B000E5KOJS Mozart - Cosi fan Tutte]]When I decide to get a DVD I always read the reviews and I am glad that I select this version for this opera.  Sometimes,when you see an opera very far from the stage you don't see much of the acting, but with the DVD production this is very important as also the singing ,for this particular  performance It is very convincing.  This is a very beautiful video.
B000002UAR|5.0|Say what you will about Sgt. Pepper and all that, I still say this is their best...without this album, there is no Sgt. Pepper to speak of, so here we go with this one. In comparison to Sgt. Pepper (and even the album preceding it, Rubber Soul) this is a lot harder-edged....the songs seem to rock more (except for Paul's stuff, of course) with all sorts of guitar stuff going on here - some of George Harrison's finest moments as a Beatle come on this album. This must have been one jarring listen back in 1966 - as a whole, it's way beyond anything else that had been done at that time.    If there was any doubt as to whether the Beatles were done with their all love song formula by this point, it's all erased with George's scathing opener \\"Taxman,\\" the Beatles' earliest direct socially-motivated number (Who'd have thunk? Quiet, content George, not angry, scathing John Lennon, would be the first Beatle to make a social statement in a Beatles song!) Paul gives us \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" which you probably now, so I'm not gonna dwell much on it, but the string arrangement and lyrics are killer. John's drugged-up \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" - an anthem for the lazy everywhere (Go John!) - is up next, with George's psychedelic guitar solo and Lennon's voice drowned out a bit by the intruments...quite the sonic experience. George's Indian fascinations manifest themselves fully for the first time on \\"Love You To\\" (sure, his sitar playing on Norweigan Wood predates this, but it was nowhere near as Indian-influenced as this.) Paul's \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" proves the Beatles CAN still do love songs (well, Paulie can, at least) and do them very well - it's one of the best in the Beatles' canon, with a bit of Beach-Boy-like harmony thrown in (think \\"God Only Knows\\" had anything to do with this one? I do!). Ringo gets his normal vocal performance with the world-famous \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" a song perfectly suited for good old Ringo, another of the Beatles' most famous numbers. More drugs fromJohn, as \\"She Said She Said\\" allegedly recalls a bad acid trip with Peter Fonda, who apparently DID know what it was like to be dead. Lots of swirling guitars, the melody changes at the end, all stuff unheard of in popular music at this time. \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" is more Paul pop, one I've heard a few too many times, but it's a nice little sunny day song. I have no idea what \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" is about, other than the fact that it's a really cool song, featuring dueling guitar riffs from George and Paul....more classic stuff. Another dose of Paul with \\"For No One,\\" complete with a horn solo and more strings. \\"Doctor Robert\\" is more John, and another one I honestly have no idea what it's about, but I always did enjoy this song, although by this album's standards, it really is quite pedestrian. \\"I Want To Tell You\\" is George's third entry here (rare for him, he usually only got 2) and probably the worst of the three, but it still would have been a massive hit single for just about any other band at the time (these guys were REAL good...). \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" is another Paul song with more horns, which was quite stunning at the time, but to be honest I'm downright sick of hearing this song and I don't know why. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is undoubtedly the weirdest thing here, with John singing phrases straight out of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, with all sorts of psychedelic swirling reverse guitars and tape loops and Lennon's processed vocal. Easily the most groundbreaking here, as it's probably the first psychedelic song by an act of that stature, bursting open the genre that would define 1967. It's easily the most revolutionary thing here, as great as the rest of this album is, and even if you aren't a fan of the track, you can't deny its importance.    So there we have it. Revolver is just plain fabulous. I don't know what else to say, except....yeah. Totally worth the price of admission.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Minutes to Midnight by Linkin Park expands the rap-metal genre into new and creatively original areas with complete artistic integrity.    Were Mozart alive today this is what he would be doing . . . .
B0000DIJO2|3.0|The DTS on my disc is defective,only sound comes from the left channel.I switched over to the 2.1 mode and the sound became louder and the sound was normal for the recording.The decoder light had activated but the decoding was low and only one channel. I e-mailed the dvd company about this and am waiting for feedback. The performance is good,but the 5.1 isn't there.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I was waiting for this movie to come out on DVD, with the associated captioning that I need as a deaf person. This was a very hilarious movie that used the beautiful greenery of England, and very quaint villages as a backdrop. So much of the humor is tongue-in-cheek and dry as I've found typical British humor to be...children will most definitely miss this humor, but it makes for a fun movie for adults. Lots of well-known actors in supporting roles, that they take and run with. One of these is Michelle Pfeifer, who plays a witch whose incredibly vain beauty depends on her retrieving the heart of a fallen star. She's still a gorgeous force to be reckon with, and apparently she doesn't mind playing ugly...complete with drooping boobs. Robert DeNiro is a pirate who is privately light in the feet, but uses his 'made' reputation (based on a lot of faked bravado) to terrorize, even if his crew knows the truth.     This isn't a serious fantasy on the line of Lord of the Rings, but the lighter fantasies of the Grimm Brothers (Not their really violent ones). The whole story is based on a young man's journey for love, in which he needs to grow up first and set his priorities straight before he can see what's in front of his face.     A really enjoyable movie, but a warning to parents (not just about the violence). Unlike Lord of the Rings or The Princess Bride, the two main characters who fall in love, also fall into bed. For those of us who like to keep our children innocent as long as possible and believe in the sanctity of marriage, this was an unnecessary part of the film (and maybe the graphic novel it came from).

0374530718|2.0|Sophie's World is an introduction to philosophy through the story of a fifteen year old girl. I think this is a great idea to teach philosophy through a story, but it looks like author couldn't decide between a novel and a textbook. Sophie's World is poorly pieced together mishmash of the two. Although it was a good intro to philosophy, it seemed that parts of a textbook were copy and pasted in between a somewhat weak story line about a fifteen year old girl. Possibly, the original swedish version flowed better and much was lost in translation. I would have rather read a textbook or a story about philosophy, not the two combined. I think that if you need to learn basic philosophy, a beginner textbook could get you through it without all the extra fluff that \\"Sophie's World\\" has. I can't say that it was entirely bad, because It was definately informative about the basics of philosophy. However, I could have just read a textbook and gotten the same information in almost the same format.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|This movie is just one great film. I like it better today then when it first came out. And DON'T listen to the doofus reviewer that precedes mine. She is simply wrong, wrong, wrong. I think that when the film first came out, each had their own expectations of how the trilogy should end. If these expectations weren't met, they criticized the film. I did to some extent back then too but today I have flip flopped like John Kerry. Rewatch the film with no expectations and you'll love it!
1933784032|5.0|If you are a Star Wars fan, you will enjoy this book about how they made the space ships and doids and more.  Fascinating for behind the scenes insights.  Great for any Star Wars fan you know.  Excellent pictures.
B00019074O|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS STILL FUNNY AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS. I COULD WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. MAHONEY (STEVE GUTTENBERG) WAS ALWAYS FUNNY AND GETTING INTO TROUBLE AND MAKING THE BEST OF THE MOVIE. HE CONTINUED ON THROUGH THE MOVIES UNTIL THE 5TH ONE. IT JUST WASN'T THE SAME WITHOUT HIM. ALL OF THE HUMOR WAS GONE. BUBBA SMITH(HIGHTOWER) WAS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST SCARIEST ONE BECAUSE OF HIS HEIGHT AND HE COULD SCARE OTHERS AS WELL. TACKLEBERRY WAS HILARIOUS BECAUSE OF HIS GUNS AND SO WERE SO MANY MORE. I GIVE THIS MOVIE 5 STARS.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|to watch all episodes!  The case the DVD's come in is great - great photos, paragraphs on each episode, and quotes from each episode. I'm hoping for a good case of the flu to keep me home all day and watch this exclusively.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Prior to this CD I was never a Kanye West fan. I'm not big on rap music. I usually like the popular songs, but never enough to purchase an entire CD. However, this CD has made my list of favorites. I listened to the CD to pick my favorite tracks and had to list all of them. That's so rare! I highly recommend this CD. It's simply good music from beginning to end!!! It's rare to pop in a CD and actually enjoy the entire album. Kudos to Kanye!!! I love this newest creation...it's good stuff!     I especially like: Flashing Lights, Good Life, Champion, Good Morning, & Can't Tell Me Nothing.
0307237699|4.0|One speech at the Democrat's 2004 national convention stood out.  Barack Obama tapped into a source of political power that few politicians manage to do: the desire of Americans to be reaffirmed as to who they are and what they stand for, to be reminded that despite our differences we are one people, worth valuing.  It was a speech powerful enough to introduce Mr. Obama to the country, and give him a shot at becoming President.    Mr. Obama had written a book before the convention speech called Dreams from my Father: a Story of Race and Inheritance, covering his early life.  After the convention speech he published The Audacity of Hope, describing his views on America, on politics, and on the leadership he would like to bring to the country.    This is a review of The Audacity of Hope.  I have sought to describe what I learned from the book concisely and completely.  I do not intend to rehash what is commonly known about Mr. Obama or argue for or against his presidential candidacy.    Obama's Ambition    Abraham Lincoln once stated, \\"every man is said to have his peculiar ambition.  I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem.\\"  I suppose most politicians who are introspective on their own motives would find solace in a similar ambition.  And a politician like Barack Obama, who is clearly an admirer of Lincoln, must be aware of that statement.    In trying to make sense of his own political persuasion and personal beliefs, Mr. Obama observes that his own satisfaction, \\"seems to come more often now from knowing that in some demonstrable way I've been able to help people live their lives with some measure of dignity.\\"  His perception of the importance of human dignity is illustrated by his tendency to embrace rather than dismiss people who have differing beliefs than his own, as illustrated in his famous speech at the Democratic national convention that launched him into national prominence, andhis speech on respecting a doctor who believes abortion should be illegal.  However, while a belief in human dignity is critical to having a polite discourse, it is not a particularly good guide to what political beliefs a person has, since the dignity conferred by a particular political policy is often in the eye of the beholder.    Government's Role in Society    A better handle on his political policies can be obtained by examining Mr. Obama's opinion on the role of government.  He looks first to \\"Lincoln's simple maxim: that we will do collectively, through our government, only those things that we cannot do as well or at all individually and privately.\\"  Mr. Obama paraphrases this statement by saying, \\"We should be guided by what works.\\"    Many Republicans and most Libertarians would conclude that Mr. Obama's statement should lead to a very limited role for government.  Many people's experience with the Department of Motor Vehicles or public schools are not very favorable.  Critics of government argue that government is like a privately held company without competition and without a need to actually serve its customers; it tends to become complacent and inefficient.  Critics also argue that in a democracy representatives chosen by the majority of voters end up passing laws on all citizens and allocating the funds of all taxpayers, regardless of whether the voters in the minority disfavor a particular decision or expenditure, and therefore even a democratically elected government is prone to violating the liberty of its members.    Mr. Obama doesn't perceive government as usually incompetent.  He sees in history strong leaders who took positive government action.  He cites Abraham Lincoln, who pushed for a transcontinental railroad, incorporated the National Academy of Sciences, passed the Homestead Act of 1862 (turning over vast amounts of public land to settlers), and created a system of land grant colleges to instruct farmers how to do agriculture more efficiently.  Mr. Obama feels government is good at making needed investments that private enterprise can't or won't make on its own, and in dealing with market failures, whether by Teddy Roosevelt (trust busting), Woodrow Wilson (federal reserve to manage money supply and cure periodic panics), consumer laws (Pure Food and Drug Act, Meat Inspection Act), Franklin D. Roosevelt (SEC, FDIC, counter cyclical fiscal and monetary policies), the Social Security Act of 1935 (a safety net that lifts almost half of all senior citizens out of poverty, provides unemployment insurance to those who've lost their jobs, and modest welfare payments to the disabled and poor).    However, Mr. Obama is also not one of those Democrats or Greens who feels a strong disdain for capitalism.  Mr. Obama perceives in both Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln a governmental role that encourages and facilitates, rather than supplants, a vibrant free market.  Mr. Obama states in his book that upward mobility is part of America's promise since its founding, and ownership of private property is at the heart of our system of liberty.  According to Mr. Obama, \\"Even our poor take for granted goods and services .. that are still unattainable for most of the world.\\"  Mr. Obama credits Alexander Hamilton in particular for a number of fundamental insights that set America on the right course: \\"Alexander Hamilton ... recognized the vast potential of a national economy - one based not on America's agrarian past but on a commercial and industrial future.\\" and he understood that \\"only through the liberation of capital from local landed interests could America tap into its most powerful resource - namely the energy and enterprise of the American people.\\"  Mr. Obama understands that some inequality will be necessary in a system of social mobility. \\"This idea of social mobility constituted one of the great early bargains of American capitalism; industrial and commercial capitalism might lead to greater instability, but it would be a dynamic system in which anyone with enough energy and talent could rise to the top.\\"  Mr. Obama also finds a faith in capitalism in the words of Lincoln.  \\"For Lincoln, the essence of America was opportunity, the ability of \\"free labor\\" to advance in life.  Lincoln considered capitalism the best means of creating such opportunity, but he also saw how the transition from an agricultural to an industrial society was disrupting lives and destroying communities.\\"    Mr. Obama also does not feel a knee jerk disdain for the rich.  \\"I admire many Americans of great wealth and don't begrudge them their success in the least.\\" ... \\"I simply believe that those of us who have benefited most from this new economy can best afford to shoulder the obligation of ensuring every American child has a chance for that same success.\\"    Mr. Obama is a big fan of Warren Buffett, quoting from him heavily.  Mr. Obama points out that Warren Buffett has said, \\"The free market's the best mechanism ever devised to put resources to their most efficient and productive use.  The government isn't particularly good at that.  But the market isn't so good at making sure that the wealth that's produced is being distributed fairly or wisely.\\"  Mr. Obama feels that some wealth has to be plowed back into education, infrastructure, and a safety net.    Mr. Obama also approves of Warren Buffett's statement, \\"When you get rid of the estate tax you're basically handing over command of the country's resources to people who didn't earn it.  It's like choosing the 2012 olympic team by picking the children of all the winners at the 2000 Games,\\" and points out the importance of environment in anyone's success, by citing Warren Buffett for stating, \\"I happen to have a talent for allocating capital. But my ability to use that talent is completely dependent on the society I was born into.\\"    Mr. Obama does feel that some important social issues may require strong cultural leadership, coupled witha governmental role that may vary by the issue.  He states, \\"To say that a value is important is not to say that it should be subject to regulation or that it merits a new agency.  Conversely, just because a value should not or cannot be legislated doesn't mean it isn't a proper topic for public discussion.\\"    However, Mr. Obama is not against influencing culture by using the power of governmental action.  He states, \\"Like many conservatives, I believe in the power of culture to determine both individual success and social cohesion, and I believe we ignore cultural factors at our peril.  But I also believe that our government can play a role in shaping that culture in shaping that culture for the better-or worse. ... Sometimes we need both cultural transformation and government action - a change in values and a change in policy - to promote the kind of society we want.\\"    Values    So what kind of society does Mr. Obama want?  Perhaps we should look first to his values.    Mr. Obama says he sees the Golden Rule (\\"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\\") as not just a call to sympathy or charity, but \\"as something more demanding, a call to stand in somebody else's shoes and see through their eyes.\\"  Mr. Obama credits his mother for asking a powerful question whenever he behaved wrongly: \\"How do you think that would make you feel?\\"  Mr. Obama learned at a young age what some never learn, that sometimes abiding by another's rules costs us little, but means alot to them, and he explains how he stopped being difficult on things that didn't matter to him when he came to such a realization.    Mr. Obama's mother was an atheist who he describes as the \\"most spiritually awakened person i've ever known: kind, charitable, and loving.\\"  He feels his mother instilled in him powerful values: honesty, empathy, discipline, delayed gratification, hard work, rage at poverty/injustice, scorn those who are indifferent to both, and a sense of wonder.    Mr. Obama is therefore well aware that having good values does not require religious belief.  Nonetheless, he states he made a strong religious conversion, albeit one where he still retains some doubt.  As he states, \\"Faith doesn't mean that you don't have doubts.\\"    His reasons for why he feels others adopt religious beliefs are interesting.  He finds the root cause in people deciding their work, possessions, diversions, and busyness are not enough.  He feels people desire a sense of purpose, narrative arc, a relief to chronic loneliness, a feeling that somebody out there cares about them, a feeling that somebody out there is listening, and a desire not just to travel toward nothingness.    As for himself, he states, \\"I came to realize that without a vessel for my own beliefs, without an unequivocal commitment to a particular community of faith, I would be consigned at some level to always remain apart, free in the way that my mother was free, but also alone in the same ways she was ultimately alone.\\"  Mr. Obama appears by his upbringing to have always felt an outsider, but by his choice of religious faith to have found a community.  Yet he found more in his faith than community, but also a step towards bringing dignity to people.  As he states, \\"...I was able to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death; rather, it was an active, palpable agent in the world. ... maintain hope and dignity in the direst circumstances.\\"    Mr. Obama feels expressions of faith are very useful in the cultural dialogue, but if left as mere expressions of faith make for bad politics.  As he states, \\"scrub language of all religious content and we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of Americans understand both their personal morality and social justice.\\"  He points out Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Madison were Deists (believers in a supernatural deity but not in the standard Christian god) who argued for separating church and state.  Mr.Obama also notes that Baptists and other envangelicals provided the popular support needed to get the Constitution of the United States ratified because they believed \\"religious vitality inevitably withers when compelled or supported by the state.\\"    To Mr. Obama, \\"What our deliberative, pluralistic demoracy does demand is that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal,r ather than religion-specific, values.  It requires that their proposals msut be subject to argument and amenable to reason.\\"  He is therefore more willing to set public policy based on science than on a religious belief alone, since to Mr. Obama, \\"faith and reason operate in different domains and involve different domains and involve different paths to discerning truth. Reason - and science - invovles the accumulation of knowledge based on realities that we can all apprehend.  Religion, by contrast, is based on truths that are not provable through ordinary human understanding - `the belief in things not seen.' \\"    The Political Parties    Mr. Obama points out the single biggest gap in party affiliation among white Americans is between those who attend church regularly and those who don't.    He first observes the Democrats as a party are more splintered regionally, ethnically, and economically than Republicans.  As a result, he feels radical Republicans have an easier time obtaining power than radical Democrats.  He feels the Democrats have become a party of reaction, and given their non-polarized electorate, Dems must avoid either/or thinking, or they will lose.    He points out the Democrats need to raise money from economic elites.  Mr. Obama describes these backers as smart, rich (top 1% of the income scale), interesting, knowledgeable, liberal, who just want their opinions heard for their checks.  He states that most of the financial backers of the Democratic party believe in the free market and an educational meritocracy, have difficulty imagining a social ill that can't be cured by a high SAT score, have no patience for protectionism, find unions troublesome, are not particularly sympathetic to those whose lives are upended by global capital movements, are adamantly prochoice and antigun, and vaguely suspicious of deep religious sentiment.    According to Mr. Obama, Republicans in contrast have a grassroots base of white evangelical Christians and conservative Catholics.  Mr. Obama talks about how the Republican party today is still living out Ronald Reagan's legacy.  To Mr. Obama, Ronald Reagan's policies were too harsh, but he does admire the political skill with which Reagan framed the debate.  He states that Reagan spoke to America's longing for order, our need to believe we are not simply subject to blind, impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies, so long as we rediscover the traditional virtues of hard work, patriotism, personal responisibility, optimism and faith.  He states that Reagan created a narrative which has been very durable, that we should side with those who work hard, obey the law, care for their families, and love their country, and against those who are out of touch, tax and spend, blame America first, politically correct elites.    Mr. Obama feels that the younger generation of conservative operatives who rose to power in the Republican party were true believers in Reagan's narrative (even to an extent Reagan wasn't), with rigid doctrines, a slash and burn style, and an exaggerated sense of having been aggrieved.  The younger generation of conservatives consolidated and institutionalized the conservative movement, leveraged the resources of corporate sponsors and wealthy donors to create a network of think tanks and media outlets, centralized power in the House of Representatives in order to enhance party discipline, and polarized the electorate.    Mr. Obama cites Bill Clinton approvingly for seeing the danger of Reagan's labels, both politically and to address problems.  Mr. Obama finds in Bill Clinton someone who used government spending and regulation as ingredients of rather than inhibitors to growth, someone who found  markets and fiscal discipline could promote social justice, and who felt both a societal and personal responsibility to combat poverty.  Mr. Obama feels that Bill Clinton  tapped into a pragmatic, nonideological attitude held by the majority of Americans.    In Mr. Obama's opinion, Republicans are fighting the last war, the war they waged and won in the 1980's, while Democrats today are still fighting a rearguard action, defending the New Deal programs of the 1930's.    Personally, I have always found it of some interest how politicians, and party followers, find it so easy to subordinate their own particular political views to the orthodoxy of their political party.  It was therefore with some particular interest I read Mr. Obama's words on the matter, since he is turned off by facile analysis and usually remarkably open about how he feels about what he's discussing.  Mr. Obama is clearly troubled by the demands of party life, but also accepting of it.    Mr. Obama finds solace in \\"...Lincoln, who like no man before or since understood both the deliberative function of our democracy and the limits of such deliberation.   ... his presidency was guided by a practicality that would distress us today, a practicality that led him to test various bargains with the South in order to maintain the Union.\\"    From Mr. Obama's perspective, Lincoln never abandoned conviction for the sake of expediency. Rather, he balanced two ideas: that all of us are imperfect and can never act with the certainty that God is on our side, and yet at times we must act nonetheless as if we are certain, protected from error only by providence.  Mr. Obama states, \\"we should pursue our own absolute truths only if we acknowledge that there may be a terrible price to pay.\\"    Mr. Obama restates the conflict between the need to understand uncertainty, and the need for action in another way.  As he states, \\"Politics, like science, depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common reality.  Unlike science, politics involves compromise. At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise. It insists on the impossible.\\"  Yet Mr. Obama also admits, sometimes just being reasonable isn't the right answer, since \\"it has not always been the pragmatist, the voice of reason, or the force of compromise, that has created the conditions for liberty.\\"  As he quotes another, \\"...power would concede nothing without a fight.\\"    Partisanship    So why does it seem like the political parties are now so much at war with each other?    Mr. Obama notes that the reason politics used to be less partisan were that (a) the world war two generation politicans had the war in common, (b) there was broad agreement on external threats, (c) America had unthreatened economic dominance, and (d) the parties were separated more by pocketbook issues (with the Democrats favoring the new deal, and Republicans favoring free markets and fiscal restraint) rather than moral issues.  Mr. Obama observes the 1960's upended the parties, to the point they are less defined now by class than by attitude.    Yet to Mr. Obama, all is not lost.  As Mr. Obama states, \\"... our history has vindicated one of the Founders' central insights: that republican self-government could actually work better in a large and diverse society, where, in Hamilton's words, the \\"jarring of parties\\" and differences of opinion could \\"promote deliberation and circumspection.\\" \\"  As he explains, \\"What the framework of our Constitution can do is organize the way by which we argue about our future...\\" and \\"...offers us the possibility of a genuine marketplace of ideas...\\", leading to deliberation and circumspection which expands our perspective, and possibly changes our minds.    Mr. Obama restates the cause of partisanship as follows.  \\"Soif we all believe in individual liberty and we all believe in these rules of democracy, what is the modern argument between conservatives and liberals really about?  If we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that much of the time we are arguing about results- the actual decisions that the courts and the legislature make about the profound and difficult issues that help shape our lives.\\"  ... \\"We want to get our way, but most of us also recognize the need for consistency, predictability and coherence.\\"    As Mr. Obama notes, \\"...my students often felt they knew the Constitution without having really read it.  They were accustomed to plucking out phrases that they'd heard and using them to bolster their immediate arguments, or ignoring passages that seemed to contradict their views.\\"  He cites the wisdom of the founders and Washington in particular, in this regard.  As Mr. Obama states, - \\"...one impulse shared by all the Founders, it was a rejection of all forms of absolute authority...\\" and \\"...one of the surprising things about Washington is the amount of time spent arguing not about what the law should be, but rather what the law is.\\"    Mr. Obama puts forward some ways to improve the political process.  Nonpartisan districting (which is very difficult to actually implement, as Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is well aware), same day registration, weekend elections, public financing or free television and radio time, and changing the rules of Congress to empower the minority party, increase transparency, and encourage more probing reporting.  My own take is that people do not understand how much Barack Obama would like to change the transparency with which government works.  He would likely bring the internet and video recording to bear on many governmental decisions.    Politicians    Mr. Obama makes a number of very interesting observations about the practical matter of being a politician.    He describes the advantages of politicians who already hold a political office as being: (a) name recognition, (b) a fund raising advantage, (c) gerrymandering (where the already elected representatives redraw their districts to in effect choose their voters), (d) most politicians are pretty likable, and (e) the already established support of grass roots organization (which is as important as cash).  Mr. Obama interestingly states that these advantages of incumbent politicians push rival candidates to look for the support of the opposing political party.  What do the political parties bring to a candidate?  Organization.  They own the list of donors, of voters, of volunteers.  They can help with raising funds, finding the right voters to hear a message, or even crafting the right message to tell.  For Democrats organization means unions, environmental groups, and prochoice groups.  For the Republican party organization means the religious right, local chambers of commerce, nra, antitax organizations.    He describes the power of media by stating that even a very active senatorial candidate can have at most direct contact with maybe 100,000 constituents by election day.  Yet a 3 minute story on the lowest rated local news broadcast reaches 200,000 people.  He concludes all politicians are entirely dependent on media to reach constituents.  He notes that repeated narratives become a reality, lodging themselves into the brain without examination, and that such spin is palatable to reporters and casual news consumers who are just looking for an interesting story to tell and listen to.  Mr. Obama points out there is no longer an authoritative central figure we trust to sort out claims, and there is no great reward in store for those who speak the truth, particularly when it's complicated.  Yet Mr. Obama feels that \\"... because those of us in public life have become so scripted, and the gestures that candidates use to signify their values have become so standardized ... it becomes harder and harder for the public to distinguish between honest sentiment and political stagecraft.\\"  He therefore concludes \\"... we long for that most elusive quality in our leaders - the quality of authenticity.\\"    Some of his most interesting observations are about the nature of Senators.  Mr. Obama states they are (a) people with a fanatical single-mindedness about the goal of becoming a Senator, (b) who are motivated most strongly by the fear of complete humiliation, since a lost election brings the feeling one has been personally repudiated by the entire community, (c) who have the need not just to win, but the need not to lose, and (d) who court money not to get rich but to maintain status, power, scare challengers, and fight off the fear of losing.  Mr. Obama states that although money can't guarantee victory, without it you lose, due to an inability to get your own message directly to voters through the media.  Mr. Obama states that absent great personal wealth, you must ask rich people for the money.  He states that he personally has learned to skip the banter and small talk that accompanied soliciting a call.  He notes that the longer you are a senator, the narrower the scope of your interactions; your schedule dictates you move in a different orbit from most of the people you represent.    On the business of actually being a Senator, Mr. Obama often sounds disenchanted.  He notes that to a Senator a single bad remark is more dangerous than many bad policies.  He finds the legislative process thoroughly unsatisfactory, due to the mixed content of bills that leave one with remorse regardless of how one votes.  He indicates there are several thousand votes a term, but just about twenty-four important bills, each easier to attack then explain.  He also states that most Senators enter the Senate with their mistakes trumpeted, words distorted and motives questioned, which haunts them during each vote.    Pleasant Surprises    Mr. Obama made a number of statements in his book that surprised me both for their perceptiveness and candor.    First, Mr. Obama holds a nuanced point of view on the 1960's.  As he describes it, \\"My rejection of authority spilled into self-indulgence and self-destructiveness ... I'd begun to see how any challenge to convention harbored within it the possibility of its own excesses and orthodoxy.\\"  I have long noted that once you care about a cause, religion or person, you are very willing to stop thinking negatively about them.  Mr. Obama notes a similar phenomenon, stating that he, \\"stopped thinking and slipped into cant\\", that \\"denunicaitions of capitalism or American imperialism came too easily\\", that \\"freedom from the constraints of monogomay or religion was proclaimed without fully understanding the value of such constraints\\", and that the \\"role of victim was too readily embraced\\".  Interestingly, Mr. Obama finds the young conservatives of Ronald Reagan's time, whose policies and means he strongly dislike, hold a rigid self belief eerily reminiscent to Mr. Obama of the new left's leaders during the 1960's.  In general, Mr. Obama disdains unthinking orthodoxy, even if it is from his own political party, which I find to be a very admirable trait.    Mr. Obama also makes interesting observations about President George W. Bush, stating, \\"I had found the President to be a likable man, shrewd and disciplined but with the same straightforward manner that had helped him win two elections.\\"  He clearly does not hold with the political belief popular in his party that Bush is a simpleton puppet of the Vice President, even to make a joke.  In fact, Mr. Obama generally avoids making negative jokes about political opponents in his book.    Mr. Obama is even more willing than I thought to look for common ground.  He states,  \\"I am obligated to try to see the world through George Bush's eyes, no matter how much I may disagree with him. ... No one is exempt from the call to find common ground.\\" and points out lawyers and political operatives are \\"professions that tend to place a premium on winning arguments rather than solving problems.\\"  As he intelligently remarks, \\"I can see how, after a certain amount of time in the capital, it becomes tempting to assume that those who disagree with you have fundamentally different values-indeed, that they are motivated by bad faith, and perhaps are bad people.\\"  Thinking the other side is influenced by evil or bad thoughts is, I think, one of the stupider things humans do.  Most people think they are doing things for noble and necessary reasons, and Mr. Obama to his credit appears to understand this.    Mr. Obama has a reputation for having great judgment when as an Illinois state senator he voiced his concern that waging war against Iraq would be a great folly.  Yet in the book he has remarkable candor about his inability to predict the future, stating that he was surprised by both how swiftly Afghanistan and Iraq fell and also thought he might have made the wrong call on Iraq when Bush proclaimed \\"Mission Accomplished\\" after the Iraq invasion.    Mr. Obama credits Reagan for seeing what Democrats didn't see.  \\"Reagan's central insight - that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic, with Democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than growing the pie-contained a good deal of truth.  Just as too many corporate managers, shielded from competition, had stopped delivering value, too many government bureaucracies had stopped asking whether their shareholders (the American taxpayer) and their consumers (the users of government services) were getting their money's worth.\\"    Mr. Obama also does not appear to fear globalization in the way that some parts of the Democratic and Republican party fear it.  As he states, \\"a strategy of doing nothing and letting globilization run its course won't result in the imminent collapse of the US economy.\\"  He has a more nuanced perspective, seeing as the pros of globalization that it has (a) lowered prices on goods once considered luxuries, (b) increased purchasing power of low income (and all other) Americans, (c) kept inflation in check, (d) boosted returns for investors, (e) allowed China and India to dramatically reduce poverty, and (f) for those with unique skills and talents and those who facilitate their work the potential rewards have never been greater.  He also sees the cons as (a) increased economic instability, and (b) those with skills that can be automated, digitized, shifted are in dire trouble.    Unpleasant Surprises    However, there is a second category of surprises, where in my opinion Mr. Obama despite his strong powers of self perception failed to take notice of his own inconsistencies.    The first is that Mr. Obama has a simplistic way of categorizing interest groups.  He distinguishes between (1) those who use their economic power to magnify political influence far beyond their numbers (\\"subvert democracy\\"), and (2) those who pool their votes to sway their representatives (\\"essence of democracy\\").  Yet as he himself notes, interest groups aren't searching for the most thoughtful, well qualified or broad minded candidates, they have an ax to grind and want you to help them grind it, if you get a few answers wrong, the endorsement, workers and mailing list go to the other guy in the primary, and there is great pressure to end up voting the same way you checked the interest group's questionnaire.  That doesn't sound like the essence of democracy to me, regardless of whether an interest group is representing large numbers of people accurately or not.    As intelligent as Mr. Obama was in his analysis of globalization's effects, he is rather hypocritical in his response to it.  Mr. Obama states that although he has been told by his constituents that, \\"Retraining is a joke.  What are you going to retrain for when there aren't any jobs out there?\\", he favors more effort on retraining.  Jobs are created by entrepreneurs or people seeing a need andorganizing people to meet it.  It's hard if not impossible for a government run training program to predict what skills those entrepreneurs will want the work force to have.  Mr. Obama notes that the Central American Free Trade Agreement, a law allowing more open trade and investment with poor countries like Honduras and the Dominican Republic, was \\"overall ... probably a net plus for the US economy,\\" but that any effect it did have would be minimal since the countries effected by the trade agreement in combination don't have an economy the size of Connecticut.  Yet he voted against it because labor unions hate it.  As Mr. Obama wisely notes, unions argue for (a) stronger labor protections in countries that trade with the US, (b) rights for foreign workers t
B000V6MQV4|5.0|I got this for Christmas '04. The 1st listen simply blew me away - vocals, guitar, lyrics - it's all awesome! You know, usually there are one or two - if you're *really* lucky, three or four - great songs on a CD. There's just not a bad song on this entire CD! It played in my car non-stop for almost a year before I gave it a rest. There have only been about 3 CDs I've heard this decade that have had this effect on me. I have to say, I haven't bought their latest, but listening to the clips and some radio play, none of them strike me as strongly as this entire CD did. Overall, Songs About Jane is one fantastic body of music!
0060763280|4.0|This is a very simple and easy book to read.  It has definitely changed the way that I think.  I would recommend it to anyone.     Eric
B000FFJYB6|5.0|This is my son's favorite movie of all time. He is 13. I bought it for him for Christmas this year and it was pretty hard to tell wether he liked this better or the laptop he got, lol. It really is a good movie that is suitable for all ages.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|If you are a musician, songwriter, or music lover, this film will touch you deeply.  If you just love a good story stripped of the extra background junk so common in modern films, this one will touch you.  For me, its the best film I've ever seen.   The scene in the music store when they start playing together is powerful, the tension of their ambivalence about whether to get romantic is moving, and the time in the studio is simply magical.  Can't wait to see John Carney's next film.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|I rarely write reviews but I DO read them. Like many others, I heard Love Song and was blown away, bought the cd based on that song and the positive reviews I read here. After listening to Little Voice non-stop for the past week, I'm surprised that there are tons of comparisons to Norah Jones. Woman + piano = Norah Jones??? That's the only similarity I detect. I hear a variety of potential influences, not just one or two.  I like every track on the album but for me, in addition to Love Song, the showstoppers are Come Round Soon, Morningside and Love on the Rocks. It may take a few listens to truly appreciate but this is a fantastic cd.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Pixar does it again with a magical story of a rat with gastronomic aspirations. The computer graphics are so well done with such attention to detail. The story line is really fun with great rapport between Remy the rat and Linguini, his human puppet in the kitchen. A dvd that will appeal to adults and children alike.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I really don't know why I picked this film up at the store.   I seemed to recall that it was on the top ten list.  I watched the movie with a smile and tug at my heart.  I couldn't always understand what was being said, but I really didn't mind.  The music is haunting and stays with you long after the movie is gone.  I found myself enchanted by the beauty of the Girl.  I thought I had never seen such a lovely woman in films for a very long time.  The first duet at the music store is so natural and beautiful.  There is a scene at the recording studio when the Girl goes off and finds a grand piano.  The Guy comes in and asks her to play.  When you watch this scene pay attention to the Guy in the back ground as he listens to the Girl sing.  It is what is called acting. Acting at its most natural and is moving at the same time. I screamed at the ending.  I knew that there could be only one ending but... it hurt when the Girl looked out the window and the the screen went black.  You really wanted a happier ending but this is a honest movie so it  had to end this way.  I gave this film only four stars because I had trouble hearing what was being said, the accents were thick.  However DON\\"T let that stop you from getting this film an loving it like I did.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Nightwish continues their Century Child sound in this album, but take it to the next level and beyond. Once is my favourite album in existence, and I'll be doing nothing but singing its praises in this review.    It starts off with \\"Dark Chest of Wonders,\\" which is one of the best songs on the album. It gives the listener a fairly good representation of how the rest of the album will be.    Next is \\"Wish I Had an Angel.\\" Another great song, and probably the best representation of Nightwish overall, if you've never heard any of their stuff before.    \\"Nemo\\" is the first semi-slow song on the album, but it's still amazing.    Then is \\"Planet Hell,\\" a fast-paced, dark, intense song.    \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" is a tribal sounding song, kinda like \\"Stone People.\\"    \\"The Siren\\" is another great piece, but I think the others outshine it.    \\"Dead Gardens\\" and \\"Romanticide\\" tend to build off of each other, and \\"Romanticide\\" is probably the fastest song on the album.    And then comes \\"Ghost Love Score.\\" This is by far my favourite song ever made. Even at ten minutes long, I don't think it's long enough. I really could listen to this forever.    \\"Kuolema Tekee Taileilijan\\" and \\"Higher than Hope\\" are the slowest songs on the album and are very beautiful pieces to listen to.    \\"White Night Fantasy\\" is, again, a good song, but outshined by the others.    \\"Live to Tell the Tale\\" is a rather majestic sounding song, and I always think majestic songs are the best way to end a song, although I think it should have ended with \\"Ghost Love Score,\\" just because it's so epic.      So in review, Once is the best album ever made, and you want to buy it and listen to it all the time.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|Spider man 3, the final installment of spider man was, as expected, overdone. it followed the footstep of X-men and Pirates and other trilogies that wanted to end with a gigantic finish...except that the gigantic part was gigantic in all the wrong parts.    to start off, 2 villians do keep us entertained...if they actually make sense that is. But both don't. the writers kept it a little too big, basically made both villains nearly invinsible, then at the end gave us a laughable end-of-villian finish. For example the sandman, after he's been bombed at, flushed at, shot at, beat at, thrown at.... and still live on to create more destruction, he just SUDDENTLY realized that what he was doing was wrong and then went like: \\"I was wrong, okay now I'm gonna go gone with the wind now\\" WHAT?!  the venom was about the same thing, an invinsible being who is scared of bell sounds???? it's as ridiculous as saying a dragon is scared of the color red. Not convincing at the least.     the theme tried to stick to the whole \\"superhero can't have girlfriends and normal life thing\\" but it still failed. Because the reasons were pretty damn weak: Peter got bad because he was infected by the venom; Mary-Jane breaks up with Peter for saving his life. none of these things actually SHOWS convincingly that superhero CAN'T have a normal life, just that when new villains came, relationship gets screwed up (the venom just HAPPENS to fall where Peter and Mary Jane is, RIIIIGHT)...which doesn't even make much sense.     overall this was a huge disappointing follow-up of the last one, which was the best super-hero movie I have ever seen. the only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because of its special effects, and Toby dancing of course.

B000K15VSA|5.0|The final cut is so great, I can't see where they made the earlier editing decisions.  If you think you've already seen Bladerunner and wasn't blown away, watch this.    We've waited years to learn about the art direction. This gave us everything we wanted to know.  Plus a little origami unicorn.

0316926345|5.0|I don't think I'm a typical Waugh reader, if there is one. A friend, devouring his ouvre voraciously, gave me this book in high school or college, and at the time I thought it very good. I recently reread it, however, spurred on by Thomas Howard's lively essay on it in The Night is Far Spent, a collection of Howardiana, mainly essays on literature.<br /><br />The second time around I was more aware of the construction, which seems to me somewhat different than the sort of savage satire Waugh was known for or the occasional dark comedy like The Loved One. I say that having read only a few novels and knowing little of the author's background. Waugh was early on the great champion of P.G. Wodehouse, whose light comedies of manners seem so different from his own novels, that I perhaps search for something of PGW in EW in my reading.<br /><br />This novel illustrates some of the pitfalls and challenges of writing in the first person, in that Captain Ryder talks somewhat differently than he thinks, with his part of a dialogue sometimes amounting to a mere sentence or even a word. Driving (reading)along that smooth road, as it were, one encounters a speed bump in the shift to the second sort of writing, which consists of descriptive passages, and to a third sort consisting of longer ruminations and reflection by Ryder on the present and past. As one reviewer put it, the story is told by indirection.<br /><br />This is Waugh's best known novel, largely due to the popular British mini-series made from it a few years back. It's also often said to be his only Catholic novel, but that means the main characters are Catholics (not Ryder) not that Waugh has some didactic purpose or hidden agenda in the writing. Those well read in Waugh may want to check out Howard's essay. For those new to him, Brideshead may well be the place to start.
0307277887|4.0|I bought the book after watching the 1st season of Showtime's Dexter. I loved the book, even though the series is very different. Even if you are a big fan the show, you should get the book and see where it all came from. The book is a very detailed and dark easy read.
0553381342|4.0|In all 31 flavors of \\"Law and Order on TV, the NYPD and DA's office disposes of a case from the incident to the trial in an hour--sometimes two if it's a two-part episode.  In \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" Tom Wolfe does the same thing in about 700 pages.  That's because Wolfe brings to bear all the complexities of trying a case in the real world.<br /><br />In the mid-1980s, Sherman McCoy is a bond salesman at Pierce & Pierce, a self-described \\"Master of the Universe\\" with a three million-dollar apartment on Park Avenue, a wife who spends thousands on decorating it, a six-year-old daughter who attends a pricey private school, and a mistress named Maria Ruskin, who herself is wealthy from marrying a much-older man.  One night Sherman goes to pick Maria up at the airport and their Mercedes Benz becomes lost on the seedy streets of the Bronx.  They're approached by two black kids, and from there the \\"Master of the Universe\\" becomes an unwitting pawn of a black \\"reverend\\" hungry for publicity, a drunken British reporter hungry for a story, and a Bronx DA hungry for re-election.  Because in the real world, cases aren't solved in an hour and \\"justice\\" is a game won or lost based on who can cheat the most and get away with it.<br /><br />Like an ancient Greek tragedy, McCoy has to pay for his hubris.  So do some of the other characters, although others are seemingly rewarded for their bad behavior.  This is certainly not a novel of white hats and black hats where the good guys triumph and the bad guys get their just reward.  If you want that, you'd better stick to the TV.<br /><br />What Wolfe does so well with this book is to paint the \\"big picture\\" of New York City in the 1980s with its melting pot of Irish, Italians, Jews, blacks, Puerto Ricans, and Wasps.  All of these rival factions collide with the McCoy case to depict not just the justice system, but society as a whole.  It's an unflattering image to say the least, even viewed through the prism of satire.  More importantly, the image of black against white and rich against poor is still applicable today in America's major cities.  That makes Wolfe's book as relevant today as it was back in the `80s.<br /><br />Wolfe's writing itself can get a little tedious and long-winded at times.  There are so many nuances and complexities and tangents going on throughout the book.  While these provide richness and depth, at some point it becomes overkill.  The stuff about the mayor and the Episcopal Church was interesting, but not really necessary.  As well there are...so many ellipses...and exclamation points!  It can be a little irritating after 700 pages.<br /><br />Still, it's a relatively minor flaw in what is a great book that even at 700 pages shouldn't take too long to read because it's so funny and clever that it's hard to put down.  I had previously read Wolfe's \\"Man in Full\\" that came out ten years after \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" and has many of the similar themes of race, class, and a rich man in legal peril, though it takes place in Atlanta instead of New York.  I'd recommend that book as well.<br /><br />As for the 1990 movie of \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" it pretty much makes every critic's worst list, so I wouldn't recommend that.  The movie does stick to at least most of the book's main points.  In its defense, it would be impossible to depict all the subtleties and nuances of Wolfe's novel on the big screen.  Trying to adapt it really was an impossible mission.<br /><br />That is all...ntly, the image of black against white and rich against poor is still applicable today in America's major cities.

B000ETQR3Q|4.0|My Mom got this for my 6 1/2yo son and his 7 1/2yo old cousin on Christmas. My brother-in-law and I both said we were getting our own Longshots! They're awsome!!! They bare a strong resemblance to the pulse rifles from Aliens when the front \\"pistol\\" is taken of (f.y.i. the elongated version makes your shot shorter due to the extra friction put on the \\"bullet\\").    Only downsiode so far is reminding my spastic 6 yo to get his bullets after he shoots 'em.     This is one of Nerf's best \\"guns\\" so far!    My son got one of the N-Strikes last year that is the big, red RPG-like gun, that thing's pretty cool too. He shot one of our cars from about 20 - 30 ft away this past year and I would have sworn from the sound of it that he had dented the car!    Thank's to Nerf for prepp'n my son to move up to some thing that might shoot his eye out later on!!!
B000K15VSA|4.0|My wife gave me this for Christmas and I was really looking forward to watching them while I was off work for the holidays.  But surprise surprise - because when I opened the box everything was there except the DVDs! Now we will find out how good Amazon customer service is.  Anyone else get an empty case?<br />Update - Contacted Amazon and they had me return the old case and sent me a new one. This time it had DVDs in it!  I upped my rating from 1 start to 4 because now I have something to review and it is a very nice collectors set - a bit over priced but wonderful as a gift :)
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Great series and it was nice to get the final season at such a reasonable price.  Thanks Amazon!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Well done DVD, with the bonus interviews and extras. If you like The Wall, you'll be pleased with this edition.
B000UR9TQE|4.0|The movie was great!  I have the previous dvd version, and the sound on this is much improved!  The sound is amazing, and the picture is clearer and the colors brighter also.  The extras on disc 2 are excellent and well worth purchasing this even if you already have another version.  The interviews are good, but the extra songs and performances are fantastic!  The film editing on the songs jumps around alot though and sometimes makes me wonder if I am actually watching the performance of that song or film of other performance edited to look like it is that song they are playing, it's hard to tell.  But overall it is excellent!!     My reason for only giving 4 stars is due to the disapointment of opening the dvd and seeing no booklet.  No slip or table of contents or picture or anything.  Just the 2 dvds in the case.  No booklet??  That was surprising and disapointing.  Guess they're really trying to make people shell out more for the collector's box.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|A great DVD, excellent production and the band is perfect. For more detail, read the Amazon review, and then buy the DVD.

B000WGZGNS|5.0|Im a huge Beyonce fan I have been one since day 1. I got a chance to see beyonce more then once live, The first time was with the other ladies of dc3 and the second was the dc3 concert (tears). I knew that she would bring it this time around and she did. Beyonce's talent can't be denied. She sang every song that I wanted her to sing including speechless. Her dancers and crew was on point as well and once she did ring the alarm I was praying that she didn't take a fall and she didn't Beyonce put on a good show and Im so proud of her...........if you love concerts like me you will love this one
1932907009|5.0|Wonderful, wondeful!  I have nothing but praise for this book!  For years I've needed someone to explain in plain english about the cataclyst, midpoint, etc., and Blake Snyder finally has.  Thank goodness!  Obviously not everyone agrees with Snyder, but the key to this book is that it explains why the blockbusters were big.  It you go against mainstream movies, then fine, but understanding the basic components of a screenplay is essential to knowing how to write those indie films.  So either way you can't go wrong.  Do yourself a favor and buy this book.  I didn't think the second book, Save The Cat! Goes To The Movies, would be necessary once I got this book, but, turns out that the second one is also invaluable, so go get that one too.  As a note, this book does not discuss format, just how to write that beautiful story of yours and -- BOOM! -- knock the socks off those studio execs.  No other book has come close to this one.  Happy reading (and writing)!
B000Y1ZXU2|4.0|Tool is my favorite band and I'll support them to the end which is why I've bought their dvd's. This is pretty much what you'd expect. A better menu than usual, but once again, a comical and unhelpful commentary. It is funny (from David Cross) but you can't help but wonder sometimes why they won't talk about the video itself. Oh well. Cool packaging. It has the stereoscopic lenses like the 10,000 Days cd with 5 double sided cards with images you stick into a slot built into the cd.     Good song, awesome video, typical presentation
B000W1V44I|5.0|Backstreet Boys are back and vocally better than ever. Unfortunately for them, the music industry has vastly shifted from the Boys glory days of  embracing their expertise (power ballads and teen-pop) into the current Top 10's club beats,  which require very little singing, a lot of synthesized phrases, and at least one rap cameo by Timbaland to be considered a hit.     So while Unbreakable got a fair amount of publicity and debuted at a decent #7 slot on the Billboard 100, it will by no means sell 10 million copies like their efforts a decade ago.     However, with that said, the BSB are truly better than ever before, and the fans who have stuck by them since the mid 90's will be thrilled.     Lead single \\"Inconsolable\\" is solid and enjoyable, but perhaps too reminiscent of 2005's \\"Incomplete.\\"     Second single \\"Helpless When She Smiles\\" is comparable to 2000's \\"Shape of My Heart\\", although, perhaps better.    One track where the Boys attempted something different was \\"Treat Me Right\\", which is catchy and would make for a good single.    Other stand-outs include \\"Something that I Already Know\\", \\"One In a Million\\", and \\"Unmistakable\\".     In 1997, Nick Carter sang \\"I'm gonna tell the world, make it understand...as long as there will be music, we will be coming back again.\\" And although the world may not currently understand their sound, which lacks techno, Timbaland, or kids from High School Musical (thank God), they lived up to their promise of good music.
B000R8YC18|5.0|Cool packaging with side plastic cover that detaches. Fold out case. Two discs. One with good looking version of the film and the second with a ton of special features. Everything you could ask for - no complaints. Great movie
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I bought New and Old versions of the Hairspray movie and recieved them as advertised in a timely manner.  I would recommed this seller.
B000VR824S|4.0|It is still one of the best DVD sets that I own. The only thing that I really didn't like was that there is too much country music present. But hey its all part of it. Also having Bill Murray in there is different and I could do without.
0452287022|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. The beautifully written novel tells the tale of the real artist Vermeer and a fictional muse, sixteen-year-old Griet, who becomes a maid because of her father's misfortune. Seventeenth-century Holland comes to life with fascinating details, believable characters, and Tracy Chevalier's undeniable talent.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This DVD set is the best music DVD set I own. It has a great mix of blues artists and Eric Clapton being one of the greatest of all-time. You will love this set. It is a must for any blues lover.
B000K15VSA|3.0|What I mean is that it was a true extended as filmed cut of that particular movie. By the supplemental materials own confessions there was a four hour version of Blade Runner. I know special effects cost alot to redo, but alot of the extra footage is usually fun, informative dialogue rich material. Also like spielberg (Close Encounter's 30th edit's) they give all supposed versions but the original \\"assembly cut\\" with all the stuff that's going to be in a deleted scenes portiuon of the disc. NOTE to film companys the next step in the 21st century, beyond the 5 minutes of extra scenes, deleted scenes sections,or multiple versions is the \\"assembly\\" or True as filmed extended versions (test audiences have a way of skewing hollywood to cut and recut there films). It's there films and vision, I don't say no. At some point of a classics umteenth re-release  how about a untainted cut free of all opinions and radical alteration's. Best examples of definitive versions, Alien quadriliogy, Lord of the Rings ext. cuts.
B0000640VM|3.0|Oliver & Company was the last film of Disney's so-called \\"dark age\\" during the '80s, an era that started back in 1979, when the great financial failure of \\"The Black Hole\\" led the company into great monetary problems which somewhat affected the quality of the projects that followed.  This 1988 film produced by Walt Disney Pictures wore the tag-line of \\"The first Disney movie with attitude\\", something that may have made it popular back in the late '80s but that somehow fell as the years passed.  Frankly, the\\"attitude\\" may just be the reason the film doesn't pass being mediocre and why it'll probably take a very long time for it to become any sort of a real classic.  The film lacks in many aspects, especially artistically.    Very loosely adapted from Charles Dickens' timeless novel, \\"Oliver Twist\\", \\"Oliver & Company\\" follows the adventures of a small kitten named Oliver in his search for a home and a family to which he can belong.  Oliver first meets Dodger, a street-wise, \\"cool\\" dog (voiced by Billy Joel) who introduces him to Fagin's band of canine thieves.  Fagin is a homeless man who is in debt with the evil ganster, Sykes.  His group of dogs, the attractive Rita, the elderly Einstein, the art-loving Francis and the wanna-be-cool (or insufferable) chihuahua, Tito, try to help him out by stealing throughout the dangerous streets of New York City.  In one of their adventures, Oliver is accidentally taken away by a rich girl named Jenny (who bares a more than obvious resemblance to Penny from the previous 1977 hit film, \\"[[ASIN:B000096IAI The Rescuers]]\\"), and the little kitten can't help but to finally feel at home in his new 5th Avenue mansion; even if he must deal with the six-time national champion dog, Georgette.  When Oliver is \\"rescued\\" and brought back once again to his previous home with Fagin and his gang, all of them become part of Sykes's wicked scheme to recover his lost money; at the same time, all of their lives might be in great danger.    Definitelyone of Walt Disney Pictures's weakest efforts since Walt Disney's Nine Old Men left the company in the late '70s.  Though the animation is mostly good, Disney did try for a realistic New York City, adding touches such as dirt, trash, advertising, vandalized walls... all together creating a very unappealing setting indeed.  Perhaps, and I'm not sure if many would agree, a more idealistic view of New York City, even if less accurate, would have worked better and given the film a better outlook.  The scenes taking place in 5th Avenue or Central Park are definitely among the best in terms of visual appeal.  The next, and perhaps even worst, flaw is the insufferable voice acting.  Though often praised as grand, I personally think that the choices were very poor.  Yes, Billy Joel, Bette Midler and others are wonderful singers and actors, but that doesn't necessarily guarantee good voice acting.  The wanna-sound-cool Cheech Marin takes the cake as the most insufferable, unbearable, annoying, repulsive Disney voice actor ever and his role here as Tito is definitely the very worst (He went by rather unnoticed in \\"[[ASIN:B00003CXB4 The Lion King]]\\" as Banzai, one of the hyenas); I couldn't help but cringe whenever Tito opened his mouth.  The songs are mostly good but a bit on the overrated side; only \\"Once Upon a Time in New York City\\" and \\"Good Company\\" come off to me as great, the rest are only so-so.  So in the end and overall, the film is enjoyable to watch from time to time, even with its lack in the artistic and sound department, it does have a number of endearing characters, good animation and an interesting and rather unusual plot.  Very different from what the term \\"Disney classic\\" has meant in the company's good years, but still tolerable.  Recommended.
B000VUDSH6|2.0|For those Jackie Chan fans who have always wanted to see a movie featuring a baby mistakingly trying to breast feed off of his nipple or watch him get hit in the face with poopie diapers... well, your prayers have finally been answered!  Robin B Hood is the newest and third weak release in a row by Dragon Dynasty... WHY?!  Something tells me that Quentin Tarrantino isn't in charge of quality control like it was once mentioned on their web site when films like this continue to get greenlit for domestic distribution.  I mean, c'mon... we already have the \\"hilarious\\" and \\"action packed\\" Chan movies The Medallion, The Tuxedo, and the entire Rush Hour trilogy(hope you can sense the sarcasm radiating off of your computer screen), so was it really necessary to bring this over from Hong Kong too?  Robin B Hood is a melodramatic comedy/action film that misses it's mark on both thrills and laughs for the majority of it's painfully long 2 plus hour runtime.  There are a few occasions where a chuckle may slip out(I mean poopie diapers hitting people in the face is kinda funny I guess...)or your palms may start to sweat(Jackie descending a multi story building by jumping from window air conditioner to window air conditioner is pretty intense) but these type of moments are too far and between to make up for everything else lacking here.  The plot centers on Jackie Chan and Louis Koo as a pair of degenerate burglars(Chan a gambler while Koo is addicted to women) who end up taking a job that has them kidnapping a baby that they ultimately fall in love with and want to protect... hijinx ensue!  I'm not knocking anyone who enjoys this kind of light action fare(my Grandma probably digs it... and she's pretty cool?) but I will say that between the brief plot description I just gave above and the title Robin B Hood(which, by the way, makes no sense whatsoever), you should know instantly if this is the type of movie you really want to sit through(and I knew I wouldn't, so please learn from my mistake).  The DVD from Dragon Dynasty is actually a 2 disc special edition and features tons of bonus material that I myself didn't watch but I'm sure will be interesting enough for fans of the film.  Those that watch this and feel the same way about it as I do will be left wondering just how and why these sub-par releases continue to take precedence over the Fist Of Legend special edition and Drednaught DVD's that were mentioned for availability so long ago?om my mistake).

Get out the kleenex because it's not all friendly bunnies and hedghogs, and not really a kids flick.  I purchased it because it is so moving.  And Ewan McGregor just keeps getting hotter and hotter.

Not one bad song.Burning a cd from a real mainstream band doesn't feel so bad.But this band isn't a big mainstream band that is played on MTV all the time,etc..So paying for the music is worth it.I don't have a fave song.They are all good.The book is the best book I ever read! The whole band is hot,which is very cool.The production was insanely phenomenal! Very tight arrangements.Theatrical,creative,very unique sound,passinate,dreamy.Lyrics from the heart.Still wish Nikki would allow private messages on his MySpace page since I don't want to share my most personal review to the world on his comment page.But this cd touched my heart!

Like I said in my Sixx A.M cd review,I would love to tell you how much your book and cd touched my heart and why,but you don't except private comments on your website or MySpace.I bought this book 3 times,gave a few away for Xmas.<br /><br />I too died once,so I understand.I couldn't put this book down.I was late to work,didn't get anything donw the week I bought this! It's very interesting,I felt like I was there with him while he was shooting up because the details he gives were so descriptive.I want part 2 or a movie,fast! After reading it,I wondered why I wasted my preteenhood in the 80's on dreaming about Vince.I should have had more Nikki posters up!<br /><br />Buy the book! ANd,you will be supporting his charity.I do wanna say that I am shocked at how he treated women back in the day.And I cannot believe that they would put up with that.If I could ask Nikki any questions it would be..How do you feel about the way you treated Vanity and the other women while on heroin? I would never wait in line for a guy,literally.And what is your relationship with Vanity now? Are you close? And did Jack Wagner find out about what you did to him before the book was published? And how did he feel about it? And lastly,why continue to date Baywatch/Playboy playmates when you had 2 bad runins? Why not try a regular girl who isn't famous..Ya know,like me? ;)

B000YPUF9W|3.0|This review refers only to the content of the film itself, not the DVD. The  Resident Evil series draws to a well-deserved close. This is much better than the second film, but not as good or scary as the original. Although the ending is kind of clever, and Milla is her usual hard-fightin' high-kickin' quick-drawin' self, this is for series completists only. Casual fans need not bother.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|Like many other movie goers in America this past summer, I was caught up in the numerous blockbusters that came out. I remember seeing the reviews were decent, and thought that it might appeal to me, but I passed, and watching it now I can say I'm sorry I did. I received this DVD for Christmas and was a little skeptical, but now I've gotta say it's definitely one of my favorite fantasy movies of all time.    It's been a while since a more fresh fantastical movie like this came out, people are so caught up in the huge titles like HP OOTP, Narnia etc, that this one slipped through the cracks. You don't need huge battles all the time to have an entertaining fantasy movie, something I think we as movie goers seem to forget.    This movie is a clever, fun, and heartwarming (sometimes cheesy) movie that makes me want to watch it again. People have likened it to the Princess Bridge, don't go into the movie thinking that! Just watch it to enjoy, not draw comparisons is all I can say. Noone's going to win any major acting awards for this films, but I thought everyone in it was believable, if not thoroughly enjoyable to watch.    All I can say is that it's a SHAME more people haven't watched it, it's easily better than half of the huge movies that came out this year that did better at the Box Office, so watch it, it's definitely a movie people of all ages can enjoy.
0385522401|5.0|On Chesil Beach is a hard novel to describe in simple terms... or rather simplification of this kind of story misses the point: there is much going on in this short novel to admire. You can admire how McEwan contrasts the emotional strength and sexual awkwardness of two newlyweds, and their living both beyond and under the coming culture of easy gratification. You can admire the soft ending that is wrenching and re-readable and possibly the truest point on the compass here. Or you can find all the truths here for yourself: how sex and marriage interrelate, how external pressures drive private conformity, how little we understand or how intolerant we are of definitions of love that seem narrowing, unconventional, or simply a challenge greater than we can meet. On Chesil Beach is a sad but wonderful novel of quiet, reverberating honesty that - unlike so many stories that feign this level of far-reaching sincerity - everyone should read.

B000J10EQU|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, and, admittedly, there are some good moments.  But seeing as the studio gave Bryan Singer all the money in the world, plenty of time, and quite a bit of creative control and artistic license (I cannot imagine that DC comics was eager to have Superman portrayed as a deadbeat dad!), there should be more than just a few good moments.  Here are the main problems, in no particular order:<br /><br />1) Brandon Routh is not a good Superman.  When he is Clark Kent, he mostly closely resembles Max Fisher from `Rushmore.'  But Max Fisher would have been a better actor.  The worst thing is, and I don't know this was Routh's idea or Singer's, but he does a note-for-note impersonation of Christopher Reeves.  IMO this is just plain ghoulish, considering that the beloved Reeves died just 2 years before this movie.  The various James Bond actors have all played the character with at least slight differences.  Each actor playing Superman has, up to this point, played the character very differently: Kirk Allyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, and Dean Caine each brought a different interpretation of the character.  Why in heaven's name Singer had Routh simply ape Reeves is beyond all comprehension, unless Routh is simply so horrible an actor that he could not be allowed to make the role his own.  On the plus side, Brandon Routh has caused me to give greater respect to Kirk Allyn, and to put George Reeves and Christopher Reeve upon even higher pedestals.<br />2) Kate Bosworth is simply the weakest, blandest, most boring Lois Lane ever.  Not only is there no chemistry with Routh, she has no chemistry with anyone.  She appears simply to have been cast for physical attractiveness and demographic appeal.  But on the upside, she enhances my already great appreciation of Noel Niell, Phyllis Coates, and Margot Kidder.<br />3) Kevin Spacey is usually a good actor, and I guess you could say he gives a good performance here, but ultimately I think he is not quite what Lex Luthor should be.  But maybe if he'd had a decent script.  I don't object to Luthor being played as a closeted gay, Lyle Talbot played Luthor that way in the 1950 movie serial.  But ultimately Spacey is a little camp in the role, even more camp than Gene Hackman in 1978.<br />4) Ultimately, the script is bad.  [SPOILER ALERT:] As much as it must have simply reeked with dramatic temptations, the idea that shortly after bedding Lois, Superman would just fly off into space for 5 years is absurd and offensive.  The real Superman, being raised on Kansas farm, would have too much Midwestern sexual guilt to permit him to just desert Lois for 5 years while she incubates his baby and marries someone else.  This is creepy.  Also, there is a scene in which Superman uses his X-ray vision to spy at Lois, her husband and baby in their home.  I'm sorry, but Superman should not be a Superstalker.<br />5) Speaking of the script, there is a lack of internal logic regarding kryptonite.  [SPOILER ALERT:] Supposedly the kryptonite in Luthor's artificial island makes Superman as weak as drugged kitten.  Yet 15 minutes later, Superman is supposedly able to lift the whole daggum island up and carry it into outer space.<br />6) There is the reuse of Marlon Brando's voice and John Williams' musical score from the 1978 Superman movie.  While these things were good in the original context, in this film they, along with his star's attempt to channel Christopher Reeve serve to create the impression that Bryan Singer really has nothing new to add to the Superman mythos, that he is flailing blindly here, creating sound and fury, but signifying nothing.<br /><br />And that is the thing.  Nothing that is new in this film is any good, and all the good things were already done in various, earlier celluloid incarnations.  And so, the upside is that this DVD has sent me happily back the `Adventures of Superman' TV show.  You are far better off viewing those concise and charming episodesthan in owning this pretentious piece of grave robbery.entious piece of grave robbery.
0316067598|5.0|I am a Marine wife who was never really into these kind of books, but as soon as I read a review on it in a magazine- I was hooked. I went to buy it that day and at first it took me a while to get into. I couldn't bear to stop in the middle of a chapter though and towards the end, I couldn't bear to stop at all. I read some of the other reviews here and got mixed messages with the main complaint being poor editing. If you are smart enough to look past whatever mistakes may be in there, this book will move you. I hope. It should. This book broke my heart but it is the best book I have ever read. I am also reading \\"The Warrior Elite\\" which was recommended in the back of this book and so far, so good.
B000UR9T8C|1.0|I love comic books and there are many comic book movies I have liked, including the first 2 Spidey films.  But `Spider-Man 3' is pretty terrible.  I think the major problems with this film come from 3 big mistakes:<br /><br />1) Trying to outdo the first 2 Spidey films.  I.e., Spidey #1 had 1 super-villain, #2 had 2 super-villains, therefore #3 should have 3 villains.  This doesn't work because these villains are clearly too much for Spidey, thus necessitating some extremely unbelievable and stupid plot twists.  And it doesn't work because there isn't enough time to develop any emotional interest in the hero-villain conflict.<br /><br />2) It's obvious that this movie was created to produce maximum video/computer game spinoffs.  The menu screen of the DVD features video game versions of Spidey and other characters moving about in video game style and a couple of the `special features' are video game promos.  The creative decision to go this way has led to fight scenes that are way too long, break too many laws of physics too often, shatter all sense of believability, and feel downfight oppressive and exhausting.  My guess is that for those of us over 35, at least those of us who don't play computer games daily, our eyes are simply not geared fast enough to really follow this kind of action.<br /><br />3) Over-reliance on Computer Generated Images (CGI).  The fight scenes all look like either cartoons or video games, and so you just don't have the kind of dramatic involvement required to suspend disbelief.  In the old days, directors had to rely on tricks of editing, camera position, stuntmen, harnesses, etc. to create exciting and believable fight scenes.  Now that those gimmicks aren't necessary, directors seem to think we'll just buy into anything.  Not so: the old school fight scenes, where you had stunt men doing what was vaguely possible intercut with close ups of the actors' faces, looking angry, exasperated, sweaty, etc., had much more dramatic impact.  Sean Connery, Errol Flynn, Johnny Weismuller, Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood never needed CGI.  Hollywood seems to think that CGI solves all problems of special effects and fight scenes.  Not so: CGI looks fake, just in a new way.<br /><br />Overall, Spider-Man 3 is bad because it follows the conventions and formulae of most modern action films: more, harder, bigger, badder, etc. and full-speed ahead with the games and merchandising.  This movie is all about the paycheck, there is neither heart nor soul.nn, Johnny Weismuller, Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood never needed CGI.

B000YA82F6|5.0|This deliciously scabrous screenplay written by Diablo Cody features the gimlet-eyed sarcastic Juno MacGuff, played masterfully by Ellen Page. At 16, Juno is pregnant and must navigate the rocky landscape with her family, a yuppie couple (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) who want to adopt the baby, and Juno's deadpan yet warm-hearted boyfriend Paulie Bleaker (Michael Cera). As the plot twists and turns toward its conclusion, we see one of the most convincing quirky and sarcastic characters to go on screen in a very long time. With everyone trying to be hip and ironic in our mediated culture, Juno is hip and ironic but not self-conciously so. The authenticity, precocity, and heart behind Ellen Page's performance makes me wonder if the script was written especially for her. Lovers of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Ghost World, and Little Miss Sunshine, will most likely enjoy this anti-hype film about a 16-year-old girl's loss of innocence. Highly recommended.
075640407X|5.0|Every once in a while, you pick up a book that you can't put down. Not in a \\"nothing better to do, just work my way through it\\" kind of way, but an, \\"I know there is earth shatteringly important things I should do, but I just can't stop\\" kind of way. This was one of those books for me.    I have read, and own a lot of fantasy and sci fi. (I could probably open a second hand bookshop in my lounge room and have plenty of stock) - Unfortunately the genre holds a LOT of OK material, and plenty of outright rubbish. Due to the amount of the latter, it has been a long time since I have enjoyed reading so much.    The language is exquisite. Rothfuss is a professional with a great vocabulary who does not over play his hand. Descriptions are succinct and meaningful, characters are real and the book has been very carefully composed and edited. It also doesn't digress and switch between characters as seems to be the style of the times. YAY.    The main character is a hero of course but the book demonstrates this as a product of his circumstance and a conscious decision regarding course of action - not a series of unbelievable coincidence that everyone except the main character understands the meaning of, blah blah blah.    It's got the whole orphan come good bit, but not in the staid predictable dickensian fashion we are continually served with modern fantasy.    I loved this book and have faith the rest will be like it.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ok - I'm a sucker for Pixar.  Nemo is one of my all-time favorite films.  With Ratatouille they do it again.  They manage to take digital animation state of the art one step further while making the animation just beautiful background for a powerful story.  The genius of Pixar is that they understand that the human emotion is king.  Ratatouille is king of this prioritization.  The animation is utterly amazing - and artistically gorgeous - but never does it take front seat or distract from the narrative.  Freeze frames on your second viewing and marvel at how lighting evokes mood - each scene composed like the great masters of painting.<br /><br />The narrative is gentle and human - a story of underdogs succeeding by finding each other and mutually supporting each other.  Ego gets in the way, but in the end human bonds overcome temporal adversity and the characters succeed in achieving what's important (doing what they love and having each other - not the \\"success\\" they thought they wanted at the start).<br /><br />The plot is a little deep for little kids, and there is less raw action than is typical for this kind of movie - so small ones might wander.  Bigger kids and adults will be entranced (or should be - if they have a heart).  Highly recommended.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|The Gilmore Girls series had five spectacular seasons and then began to fizzle off in odd, ill-fitting tangents. This, reportedly, was due to issues between writer/creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and the network. Some late-coming fans didn't like the series finale. Spoiler ahead - no wedding bells, no sunshiny ending. The final episode does seem a bit contrived and slapped-on, but it is more true to the spirit of the show than most any other episode of the final two seasons. While the finale could have used more polish it ends in way that is appropriate to the Gilmore world of Stars Hollow.     The bulk of the series is sharp, witty and has some of the best writing television has ever seen. I've heard it said that there must be a meth lab leaking its fumes throughout Stars Hollow resulting in the rapid-fire dialog. I view the pace more as an old classic film or stage play. There's a genuine heart to this little show that many viewers missed out on due to its girly-sounding title. If you can keep up, there's bound to be something in the program that relates to just about everyone.     The series set is beautifully contained in this compact little box. The graphic design is clean and stunning. There are no photos on the discs; however each is numbered and color-coated to coincide with the season. Full-body character photos accent the disc flaps. The complete Gilmorisms are compiled into one neat book. There's also an accompanying season guide that includes many great glossy pictures.     This treatment of the show receives a top score. The series itself loses half a star due to the unfortunate floundering of seasons six and seven. Seasons 1-5 will definitely get the most use out of the set.
1582701709|5.0|I would like to stress the point that this book is introducing you to a tool- a tool of mind- not introducing to a strategy you shall take. The basic definition of a tool: something to use as an aid for you in what you are doing to help you reach your desired destination. Actually, tools are made to aid us not to conquer us, so don't read this book expecting to find a magic formula in it that will make you the happier person on earth. Of course, people occupied by this conception can be disappointed as many colleague reviewers felt. I will repeat it again NO MAGIC FORMULA in this life to reach your ultimate success or happiness or wishes. NO! we shall work and work hard. This book is just giving you a mind tool which you can use while you are working. Actually, the book is giving you the things that are basically necessary for you to work..Nobody can work efficiently without feeling good...nobody can innovate something without imagination...nobody when invented something knew how will invent it. The book is not telling you to stay day dreaming while you are in bed..No! The book is telling you to get up from bed, go to work WHILE you dream of your wishes. The law of attraction is true, but only when you are sitting your environment to receive from it...and setting the environment is ONLY done by putting efforts. Therefore, know what you should be WORKING on, ACTIVATE the law of attraction..YES you will get what you want. Consider this book the complement of your real work...When you hard work, you are putting something physical, when you use \\"The Secret\\" you are putting something inside you = Achieving what you want.

There also is a great deal of information on each page.

B000W04S6U|5.0|As one who has appreciated the music far more than the game itself--and has purchased the previous three soundtracks (Halo 2 had two separate volumes)--it should come as no surprise that I had my eye out for the final OST of the series.  I was a tad worried that they might pull another Halo 2: Vol. 1 scenario where they do two volumes and load the first with a bunch of licensed junk; sorry, Bungie, but I DIDN'T buy Halo 2: Vol. 1 for the tracks by Incubus and other rock musicians.    So for those who want music strictly from the composer (Martin O'Donnell), you will love this soundtrack.  This OST is comparable to what they did when releasing Halo 2: Vol. 2.  A series of suites (this time spliced into more individualized tracks) built specifically for pure listening joy.  As for that listening joy, it seems Marty has out-done himself this time.  This soundtrack exudes everything you'd expect from the final chapter of a trilogy, and then some.  This OST is also filled with tracks that are remixes of music from previous games, and are remixed so well as to either feel completely new or offer up what seems to be a deliberate retrospective nostalgia built to make you think back on the whole journey the series has taken.    So, you may ask, are there any low-points to this OST?  Well, there's one hidden (i.e. unlisted) song on the 2nd CD that's terrible and isn't even by Martin O'Donnell, but other than that all I'll say is I'm generally not a fan of any of the Flood themes (heavily present in the track Dread Intrusion).  Granted, I appreciate them for what they are meant to be: the creation of a creepy mood.    Overall, the soundtrack is wonderfully diverse.  A few soft themes here, some epic upbeat pieces there, some short creepy melodies, and some simply stunning retrospective pieces.  It's varied, but each track flows so nicely that you'd think it were one big masterpiece, which is certainly a fine way of describing this soundtrack.  After all, Martin O'Donnell has managed the unthinkable: music so good that I buy every soundtrack without buying a single game.*    Kudos, Marty.    *(As of this review I have yet to own any Xbox systems, and have merely played Halo 1 and 2 on a friend's Xbox, finishing the single-player modes of both games.  I have yet to play the 3rd game, and even if I owned any Xbox systems I wouldn't buy any of the three games.  Interesting, no?).

B000065BPB|5.0|This review is mainly to address the two most common things noted in other reviews. The first is the small maximum size, the second is their allegedly vice-like grip on the head. The first is completely true. They fit me, but only on the farthest extended setting. Is this helpful? Not yet, no. A size 7 1/4 hat would fit loosely on my head, and from that you could probably figure out if your head would fit these headphones.    The grip isn't really that tight in my opinion. It IS snug, but i wouldn't call it anything more.    Those two things aside, the sound is great, and they effectively isolate me from the world without using any batteries.

While Jamie and Claire fascinate me, and I cannot get enough of them, there were other characters who did not interest me at all. Overall, this is an excellent author.

There are a couple of slow songs that I didn't like at all such as Insoluble and Miracles. I would recommend getting the album, but I think it could have been better. Paper Monsters was a better album as a whole, although I like some songs on Hourglass better than any song on Paper Monsters.

It's by far the greatest movie of the year (2007) and I enjoyed every second of it. It's quite long which in this case is a good thing. You get lost in the mystery and the era. The costumes are fantastic and the script is top notch. The actors are also fantastic. It's a smart and creepy mystery with fantastic cinematography and will leave you feeling uneasy. It's by far the best suspense movie in a decade. Great movie!

But Allie's parents don't approve, ultimately taking her away and splitting up their love.<br /><br />Time passes, World War II comes and goes, and by a chance meeting, Noah finds himself back in Allie's life. Allie must then choose between her fianc&eacute; Lon and her teenage love Noah. Lon offers her responsibility and stability, while Noah offers her adventure, magic, and life. This story wouldn't be much more than your run-of-the-mill romance if it weren't for the overarching frame of the whole tale.<br /><br />Interspersed throughout the teenage drama is the modern-day scene of Noah at Allie's hospital reading her the story of their love. In spite of the doctor's lack of hope, he visits her every day and reads her their love story in hopes of waking her from her dementia and spending a few moments with the love of his life. While their teenage love is based almost solely on physical passion and lust, this glimpse of faithful, old-age love is deeply moving and poignant. Sure, there's something about Noah that brings Allie's character to life, bringing back her love for painting and art and adventure, but it's the story of them as an elderly couple that really makes this story sing.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens

B000VLE3IS|5.0|A great product for those new to Led Zeppelin, and old timers alike. Containing most of Zeppelin's early and latter day hits, this collection is sure to bring back memories of relentless riffs, and spine shattering solos.     If you are new to Led Zeppelin, this is the first truly definitive collection offered for a reasonable price, the Early Days/Latter Days being a bit too expensive for my tastes.    The DVD has some good content as well,  and  is worth the buy. All in all, a good refresher, but if you have all the songs, hold of on buying.    For those new to Zep, go right ahead, and but this great set. You won't be disappointed.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|Daft Punk integrates more sensitivity into their music than the average electro band. The duo's robotic avatars seem to explore the very boundaries dividing humanity and technology in their music. The welcoming cheers of the crowd are penetrated by digitized voices. HUMAN... ROBOT... HUMAN... ROBOT... the words slowly merge and overlap, a literal and figurative fusion, which becomes a crushing chorus of the legendary Robot Rock, while the audience screams its approval. The mood shifts slowly but constantly throughout, and when the end nears some sixty minutes later, the listener can really feel the euphoric state of fatigue that grips the crowd.     Overall, the listening experience is exciting and supremely entertaining. This is a concert, and as such it's a gift to the deepest fans. Daft Punk takes some time to mix and remix and improvise some tunes. Any follower will appreciate some of these unfamiliar, catchy sounds. On a technical level, the sound is vast and altogether excellent, although not as consistent as a studio recording, being a live show in open air. In two or three spots, it sounded as if the pickup mics had taken as much sound as they could handle and were at the mercy of God-knows-how-many thousands of watts. But these minute, insignificant distractions actually made me enjoy the sound more, as I imagined the impossibly huge PA system blasting forth its cacophony of pressure waves into the crowd.   So the bottom line is, you follow Daft Punk. Maybe you've got all 3 studio albums. Maybe you've got Interstella. Maybe you've heard of Electroma. Well, there's no reason you can't take an hour or two, fire up your shelf system or your surround sound and enjoy the sensation of a colossal Daft Punk concert playing at your house, at your house.   You've got to set them up.

B00005JMEW|2.0|Having seen both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction(and loving both!) I purchased used(thank God) both volumes of Kill Bill.  Having just finished watching Volume 1, I felt compelled to express my utter dislike for this movie. So here I am.<br /><br />This movie had a good first half. It did. Entertaining. Not as entertaining as Dogs or Pulp(can anything surpass Pulp?) but nevertheless held some interest.  But the last half took me down quickly.  It was so over the top, so saturated with silly, bloody fight scenes which were too drawn out, too cheesy, and no real surprises that not only did I lose interest, I could not wait for the unrealistic  blood bath to end.  I won't be watching this one again.  Why would I?  The dialogue was more than lacking.  The action was too unreal. Way over the top!  Over the top can be a good thing. But TOO MUCH of a good thing can become a bad thing.  This was an utterly bad thing in my book.<br /><br />Unfortunately I still have Volume 2 to watch. Maybe it will be better?<br /><br />I think I would rather put Pulp Fiction in the DVD player.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|At a certain point, a marvelous band will get a reputation so overwhelming, it's simply not possible for them to keep topping themselves.<br /><br />And from the sound of \\"In Rainbows,\\" Radiohead has decided not to let their reputation loom over them -- and I'm not just talking about the online digital release. In their latest album, they reinvent their bittersweet pop sound -- they lose some of the trappings of their past work, in favour of warmer, more intimate melodies and traditional instrumentation.<br /><br />It opens on an angular note with \\"15 Steps,\\" which is built around a jagged riff.The first couple minutes are full of fuzzy synth stabs and sharp drums, sounding like a jazz number that's being eaten by a computer. \\"How come I end up where I started?/How come I end up where I went wrong?\\" Thom Yorke sings mournfully. \\"You reel me out then you cut the string...\\"<br /><br />But then the guitars slide in and twine through the song, softening it into something very different. The scratchy synth beats and subtle guitar start building to a slow crescendo, staying energetic and almost reggae-esque right to the end.<br /><br />See it as kind of a transition song for Radiohead; they're easing listeners into their new acoustic sound, rather than just dropping us in. But after that, they pretty much leave the \\"Kid A\\" territory behind them -- \\"Bodysnatchers\\" is an intense rocker brimming with chunky riffs and softly ringing guitars. It's a gorgeous piece.<br /><br />After that, the songs gently slip down into more introspective territory -- smooth, dark pop songs wrapped in a heavy blanket of fluid strings and subtle slide guitar. Some of these are dressed up in thick guitars and clattery drums. \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place drops the strings for a vibrant guitar-rocker edged with synth, and it all finished up with the quivering, melodic finale \\"Videotape.\\"<br /><br />You know, I didn't think that Radiohead could surprise me. So many bands get mired in their best-known sound, and they keep turning out the same ol' because that is what the fans expect. But Radiohead has not only made an exquisitely bittersweet pop album, but they've also injected vitality back into their sound. They sound brand new.<br /><br />Particularly, they've almost abandoned the cool, alien synth of their last few albums. It's still there in patches, but it's quietly overwhelmed by the layers of slide guitar, streams of piano, and smooth sweeps of elegant strings. These are seamlessly woven with  clattering drums and cymbals, thick crunchy riffs. And yes, occasionally a little speck of synth.<br /><br />But their songwriting is much the same -- simple, yet oblique (\\"I am a moth who just wants to share your light... I only stick with you because there are no others/You are all I need\\"). While Yorke's trademark wail is still in place, he sounds more melancholy and contemplative than outright woe-is-me angsty. He even sounds a bit cheerful in \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi.\\"<br /><br />Most long-standing bands can't summon up a new sound, and new freshness, this far into their careers.

B00008PX8P|5.0|Ever since 'Whole Lotta Love' played on our local radio station I have been a fan, but never got the chance to see them in concert.

This DVD cuts through all that and provides the best view I have ever seen of this classic band on stage.

I never bothered to purchase either of these because I never really heard anything good about them. Well for Christmas my sister got me a gift card to Borders Books. I went to Borders the other day and I was looking around and picked this one up . I looked around some more , put it back down and looked around some more. Later I went a picked it back up . I said to myself , well I might as well get it. I got in my car , put it in the cd player and listened . I should have never picked it back up ! I truly love Muddy , but this cd is HORRIBLE ! Terrible remakes of a few Muddy classics and and unbearable cover of The Rolling Stones \\"Lets spend the night together\\" .  To me this was a true waste of money . If you are new to Muddy , stay away from this cd because it will turn you off from the rest of his classics. If you love Muddy , stay away from this cd because you will feel like you just flushed your hard earned money down the toilet. HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!<br />If you wanna get some great Muddy , get any cd contained in my blues listmania.

B00007K02F|2.0|I bought this movie expecting it to be a more modern and updated version of the Timothy Dalton version of Jane Eyre.  This may be just my personal preference but if I am going to sit down to a movie I expect it to include most of the stuff in the book (the movie excluded the scene where Mr. Rochester calls for Jane and she hears and answers him even though they are hundreds of miles apart from each other, which is one of the best parts of the book)and their was absolutely no romance.  I couldn't see Jane fall in love at all she just all of a sudden expresses her emotions to Mr. Rochester and he 's like \\"Wow, that is totally awesome.  I was hoping you would say that. Let's get married in two weeks.\\"  Go watch the Timothy Dalton version.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This adaptation of Jeff Lindsay's first book [[ASIN:0307277887 Darkly Dreaming Dexter]] is amazingly rich and mostly true to the original story.  Any adaptation for screen will have changes and characters that are consolidated or abbreviated - but that is minimal in this case.  The additions to the stories (to fit the series format) are crafted well and keep with the style and wit of Lindsay's creations.<br />Michael C. Hall [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set]] previously in Six Feet Under - is a versatile actor, providing the character Dexter with a likeable facade and a dark underside in equal measure.  Julie Benz [[ASIN:B000TLTCU4 Angel - Complete Series Collector's Set]] who played the seductive Darla on the Angel series, is equally facile at the vulnerable Rita, \\"as damaged as Dexter\\" in her own way. The supporting characters/actors are strong and multi-dimensional, giving this a depth that enables you to peel back the layers and discover new angles to them all as the series progresses.<br />Beware - you will find yourself feeling very guilty about identifying with Dexter - and if not, well... perhaps you need some training in the \\"Code of Harry\\".
B000T05R8Q|5.0|Assuming that the reader already considers this LP to be one of the greatest albums ever recorded, I can curtail my sales pitch by mentioning that it is a timeless landmark in the psychedelic period of pop culture and a fascinating insight into the mind of an unfurling schizophrenic. This was the LP that made me want to write songs. I wasn't aware of the myriad possibilities that Syd Barrett pioneered. It should not be forgotten that the rest of the band (and producer Norman Smith) did an excellent job in translating Syd's tragic genius. The presence of the mono mix is quite revealing as certain instruments are more to the fore than in the stereo mix, and are often heard with less effect. \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" and \\"Flaming\\" come to mind as examples. Also, the inclusion of the Syd-era singles make the collection more worthwhile, as they are amazing as well. However, with Syd now having passed, I have to wonder why the principles are holding back on such craved rarities as \\"Scream Thy Last Scream\\", \\"Vegetable Man\\", \\"Lucy Leave\\", \\"king Bee\\", \\"I Get Stoned\\", \\"In The Beechwoods\\" and the backing track to \\"She Was A Millionaire\\". The first two have been widely distributed on bootlegs and are quite objectively two of the greatest songs Syd ever composed, even if they are acutely unnerving. Moreover, \\"Millionaire\\" is a song that will be lost forever unless some record of its existence is produced. I'm afraid that no one has the lyrics anymore or could remember the melody. I do know that it was considered as a single. If Rick Wright could remember any of the missing parts, I and several other musicians would LOVE to finish that song. It was a waltz! (food for your imagination...)<br /><br />To sum up, YES - BUY IT. But on behalf of Syd fans everywhere: when will we be able to hear the outtakes that we've been dying to hear?
B00005JPTK|4.0|Will Smith is the last man on the Earth. Or is he? You will know the answer in the third (English-speaking feature-length) adaptation of Richard Matheson's famous and influential novella, where Smith's protagonist Robert Neville lives alone in New York City with his faithful dog Sam.    When I say alone, he is really alone in Manhattan. The film's first 40 minutes is the greatest part of it where Robert Neville can be seen driving a car wildly in the desert streets of New York City, hunting a herd of wild deer by day, and hiding in a bathroom with his dog by night, hearing weird noises from outside. Obviously he is trying to keep his sanity among the remnants of the civilization that is going to end. Director Francis Lawrence has a clear vision as to how the world would end, not with a bang but with a whimper.    Unfortunately, \\"I Am Legend,\\" some might say, really ends with a whimper. I am saying that it does not have actions - it has - but it is exactly the actions that might be a bit disappointing. They involve shootings, explosions and CGIs, but the film could have taken another approach. (And the new film changed the meaning of the title's \\"Legend.\\") Not that I didn't enjoy watching them, though.    The film's location is, as I said, New York City while Matheson's original was set in LA. The change is a good idea as NYC has more recognizable landmarks which the film uses quite effectively during the flashback scenes. Also effective is Will Smith's acting as military scientist Robert Neville (formerly played by Vincent Price and Charlton Heston). His excellent acting makes up for the loss of the apocalyptic story's social undertone represented by \\"Dark Seekers.\\"    Uncredited Emma Thompson appears briefly in the film's opening sequence, so don't be late for the show.
B00005JPTI|5.0|Will Smith does a remarkable and memorable job of acting in this, I Am Legend. If you have the empathy and fortitude to stay with him it is a gut-wrenching ride through sorrows, sanity, and insanity. Smith plays a strong character who sticks with it against all odds and keeps going even when he sees no hope. His hero is Bob Marley with his fortitude fighting against all odds and this links a sci-fi dilemma to the dispair that seems to characterize our times.   BE WARNED: This is not entertainment as such. It is slowly paced and in this will probably appeal only to mature adults who have the capacity to get empathetically into lonely characters. So it cannot be called an action film. The sci-fi is not escapist or impressively high tech.The sci-fi is a thin vehicle for exposition of a human being. The dialogue does not seem for the most part important, though the situations themselves certainly are important to the acting. The ending is not sensational.   I found it to be more an ordeal to watch than entertaining because there was constant tension and emotional suffering. I had to decide whether to stick with it or walk out. But it was well worth sticking with it to see a great artist given a rare chance to carry a substantial film.  I liked Crusoe for this reason, but Smith beat that and there is much more substance to Legend. I would say the same comparing it to Castaway. I appreciated the directing and editing here to be sure.  Unfortunately Legend is probably not a popcorn seller, but I hope that enough of the film-making and acting art in it will show through at the box office to encourage other talented American actors and directors nevertheless to get a chance to show their stuff.
006117758X|5.0|Charles Bukowski's Ham on Rye details the early childhood of his fictional alter-ego Henry Chinaski through his teen years up until the attack on Pearl Harbor.  A majority of the novel finds Chinaski growing up in the depression-laded lower-middle class part of Los Angeles, and details his discoveries of alcohol, women, authors, and writing.  What is most likely an autobiographical fueled novel, Ham on Rye ends up becoming a startlingly poignant piece of literature, much like many of Bukowski's novels.  The reader becomes impassioned with Chinaski's hard, young life as he discovers and withstands the futility of his own existence, gets into fights with his privilaged schoolmates, and develops an extremely painful case of acne that leaves him physically scarred.  Though we don't always feel sorry for Chinaski as his actions make him labeled a \\"truly ugly person\\", there's no denying that Ham on Rye is a stunningly powerful and bleak portrait of the life Bukowski himself lived.  Not as quintessential as Post Office of Factotum, but an essential piece of Bukowski's work nonetheless.

I finally decided to purchase this DVD and own it for myself since I thought the first one was quite interesting. The action isn't quite the same as the first one but the theme is still the same. Of course, the biggest downer was the lack of extras on this DVD.    As a semi-collector I sort of thought this was worth getting as I bought this and the first one together. I don't think there's any other version released and I wasn't sure how long I would have to wait for another to be released so I eventually caved and got this.

0143034901|5.0|SHADOW OF THE WIND was my final book of 2007, and I chose a good one to end the year with.  This is a highly enjoyable novel, a pure entertainment.<br /><br />The plot of SHADOW OF THE WIND deals with a mysterious book of the same title, a book that some strange force is intent on destroying.  The hero of this novel gets his hands on he only surviving copy, and quickly becomes obsessed with the mysterious life of the author.  The rest of the novel deals with the hero solving this mystery, as well as dealing with the difficulties in his own personal life.<br /><br />Some have described this novel as a \\"guilty pleasure\\", because the characters are overly colorful and the plot melodramatic.  I didn't mind this at all.  SHADOW OF THE WIND isn't afraid to tell a good story, and I found myself entranced by the sheer fun of it.  Some people have compared this novel to the work of Dickens, and I think that's a fair comparison.<br /><br />If you prefer your novels literary and subtle, this book probably won't satisfy you.  But if you like emotionally-charged storytelling, SHADOW OF THE WIND is hard to beat.  I really enjoyed this one, and am glad I closed the year with it.

B000BSY142|5.0|It is a DVD study guide, easy to use, with summaries, in-depth analyses and pop quizzes on the chapters.  It is NOT the whole story so you should read 1984 BEFORE using this study guide.  You may miss a lot of the details and also not understand the summaries without reading the novel.  I don't think it is better than other books or reviews on 1984 but for a person who is just started to read 1984 or Orwell's books, this may be easier.
B000002UR7|4.0|I have always overlooked Radiohead I always thought they were a soft rock band like Kyruss, U2 or Coldplay and so I never gave them a chance until recently.  This album rocks hard and is the only Radiohead album I've gotten into I have yet to discover The Bends or OK Computer I'm still to busy listening to this amazing debut so I can't say right now that this is there best album.  Once I am done with this album I am going to move on to there later work.  There is not one bad song on this album but there does seem to be a few filler tracks which is the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  If your a fan of 90's alternative rock like me pick this album up you won't be disappointed.

1401300529|4.0|The Korean War lasted 4 years. Halberstam covers the first year. The political implications and the relation of MacArthur to his government is an apalling story. Well written and placing this part of western history in a good context. However, the story continues after Wongju, but not in this book.   The whole decision making and the efforts, military and political, needs a thorough description for the whole lenght of the war. We, in our days, can learn from this when we have to make decisions whether or not our soldiers should die in Afghanistan.   Jan de Jong, Netherlands
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Sicko should be required viewing for all Americans.  I thought I knew what was in Sicko when I first heard about it so I resisted watching it.  When I finally got around to watching it, I was blown away.  Any objective person who watches this remarkable documentary will realize, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the U.S. ranks at the bottom of the free world when it comes to health care.  They say a nation can be judged by how it treats its poorest citizens. The U.S. would get a failing grade in any impartial test.<br />If enough people see Sicko I think there may be some hope that grass-roots citizens will be able to influence our government to improve our health care system to something that approaches the rest of the free world.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is without a doubt the best war story I have ever seen! You feel as if you know the characters as the series progresses. Watch the documentary portion first and this will put a real face to the characters as they show up in the drama. It was also a nice touch to put the elderly men who were just boys throughout the series commenting on scenes and recalling battles. My wife, who does not like war movies at all, began watching and was immediately drawn in and looked forward to each new episode.
1400079179|1.0|After reading this book, I seriously had to go have a drink and sit on the toilet. Never have I read such an over-hyped book. I heard people really liked it, so I went and read it myself. Not only is the ending painfully obvious from about 700 miles away, but the character development is very poorly done, the dialogue is dreadful, the writing is insulting to one's intelligence, and Robert Langdon is the most irritating, pretentious, and poorly made character I have ever read about.<br />I read this book in four days, not because it was interesting, but because I assumed it would get interesting at some point in the near future, not to mention it was an incredibly easy read. I could not have been further from the truth. After finishing the final page, I was sad, not only because it was a terrible read, but I was positive that I had gotten dumber after reading it.<br />I then said to myself, \\"Why does everyone think this book is so great?\\" So I decided to search for some reviews about it. The truth is, everyone thinks this is so great because it's mindless; it does not take an ounce of thought to be entertained by this book. Maybe it's just me, but I like reading something and being rewarded with more insight because I took the time to sit and think about symbolism, theme, what a character does as opposed to what he/she says, etc. This just didn't do it for me. Almost all of the five-star reviews say \\"I read it in (insert low number of days)!!!!!\\" Yeah, so did I. GET A NEW REASON, THAT ISN'T A GOOD ONE FOR LIKING A BOOK.<br /><br />I read this book and I went to my computer to write (I'm studying creative writing in college) and I noticed that my writing was actually simpler than it had been before I picked up this book. I was using simple words, I couldn't think of what to say next, I was routinely running into writer's block. I then had to take a few days off to read F. Scott Fitzgerald and I was better.<br /><br />Don't read Dan Brown if you appreciate literature and what it can bring to the table.<br /><br />If you don't read often or if you just want to take a break and read something slightly entertaining (I'm being generous), go for it.the table.

B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|Ok, so, i've had this DVD since dec. 18th., i have watched it multiple times and i have to say, this is the most ambitious piece of film i've ever seen from ANY band in ANY genre. To me the 'Vicarious' video itself has alot to do with DMT (for those of you not familiar with DMT check out: erowid.org) and a sort of second awakening. I also own the 'Parabola' DVD and this one blows it away. I love every video that adam does but this one is special. For the first time they've gravitated toward an all CG video, adam usually utitlizes stop motion and a more human element to his videos but, not this time. You can tell it's an experiment of sorts, kind of just sticking your toe in the water before jumping in. Oddly enough they got a stop motion feel with CGI which is hard to accomplish being that CGI is smooth by nature which brings me to the documentary.<br /><br />Overall 'The vicarious' docu. is a some what revealing look into adam's work past and present as well as all the people who helped create the video. Nothing to write home about since adam does not comment himself, it's more of an ode to him through artists and friends he's worked with.<br /><br />The commentary is great. David cross is a funny, funny man. He had me laughing out loud on numerous occasions.<br /><br />The CoSM section is also wonderful and inspiring. Alex grey is def. one of the greatest artists EVER! his vision is executed perfectly and his works are beyond this world. I suggest everyone visit : [...] and support a great man.<br /><br />This DVD is most certaintly worth $10.00. Buy it and support real artists.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This film is fairly accurate and mostly without political spin ( by nature, all historical works have some spin ). It allows the historical facts re-tell the story.     Indeed, I would love to see more WWII ( and yes, maybe some WWI or older ) battles told in this fashion. The movie Midway started down this path, but drifted very far in its attempt.    Tora, Tora, Tora is worthy of of watching both from a film standpoint and from a historical standpoint. Buy it, watch it, and show it to your kids ( age appropriate, of course ).
B0000A0DRY|5.0|One of the great masterpieces of the psychedelic era, Surrealistic Pillow is a dreamy, playful, and often gorgeous mixture of starry-eyed rock `n' roll and lush, acidic folk, tinges of both pop and hard rock swirling in the shadows. It's an irresistible confection, an alchemy that is both thrillingly subversive (listen to the nightmarish L.S.D. anthem \\"White Rabbit\\") and instantly accessible (as in the icy, gorgeous acoustic rumination of \\"Comin' Back To Me\\"). Between these two poles lie acidic rallying cries (\\"Somebody To Love,\\" 3/5 Of A Mile In 10 Seconds\\"), ethereal drones (\\"Today,\\" \\"How Do You Feel\\") and playfully endearing romps (\\"My Best Friend,\\" \\"She Has Funny Cars\\"). It's consistently brilliant and utterly irresistible, a delicious swirl of California bohemianism and pop sensibility. Get it now.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|Had not heard much about this movie, so i wasn't expecting anything. What a excellent surprise we had. It is a mix between \\"Armaggedon and Event Horizon\\".    What makes a excellent movie is that you can not anticipate what's coming next, you think it's gonna be one way and the story turns out to be far from what you expected...really, really far.    Next thing that makes a excellent movie is the music. No good background music, no good movie. This one is just awesome.    A must see piece of art.

I expected a lot from reading the book jacket to looking at the very catchy cover, however, by the time she got to India, I completely lost interest in her journey.

B000YABYLA|5.0|\\"All I notice is those `pork swords'\\"<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) walks around taking swigs from the largest bottle of Sunny Delite you will ever see. She hurries into a convenience store and purchases a pregnancy test from the clerk (Rainn Wilson, TV's \\"The Office\\"). Her fears are realized. She is pregnant after having sex for the first time with Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera, \\"Superbad\\", TV's \\"Arrested Development\\"). She tells her father Mac McGuff (J.K. Simmons) and step-mom Bree (Allison Janney) and decides she wants to have the baby, but give it up for adoption. Enter the perfect couple, who are unable to conceive, Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner, Justin Bateman). As the pregnancy progresses, Juno has trouble with her feelings for Paulie and the perfect couple have problems of their own.<br /><br />I know. From the description I just relayed, \\"Juno\\" sounds like an afternoon special, a precautionary tale, a drama. It couldn't be any more different than that. Director Jason Reitman (\\"Thank You for Smoking\\") takes a screenplay by first time writer Diablo Cody, a former exotic dancer, and creates one of the funniest films I have seen this year. Much like the equally funny \\"Lars and the Real Girl\\", both films take characters who are off center, but believable, and allow us to watch as they use humor to deal with difficult situations.<br /><br />\\"Juno\\" works so well because Juno is so believable. She seems like your average rebellious teenager. Ready and willing to act out, albeit mildly, she is just a teen girl trying to figure things out. So when she is in a band with Paulie, and there seems to be an attraction, he might be the right guy to try sex with for the first time. He is also attracted to her, so he agrees. They are testing out sex together. As Juno relates these events, she provides us with amusing insights, noticing Paulie's addiction to Orange TicTacs for instance. Also, Paulie is on the Junior High running team, so she seems to notice eight or nine of his team mates running by her, wearing their short gold running shorts, their \\"pork swords\\" moving underneath, at all times. This is a constant running joke, no pun intended, because Paulie's teammates always seem to be running by Juno whenever she is outside, emphasizing the fact she is noticing boys for the first time in her life.<br /><br />JK Simmons and Allison Janney are also very good as her parents. As each is introduced to us by Juno, she also provides amusing antidotes for them as well. For instance, we learn her step-mom Bree (Janney) runs a manicure salon, so Bree, like all people who are preoccupied with the one thing they are good at, talks about nails, and manicures, and everything related to it, sneaking in these references as much as possible. When she takes Juno to see a doctor, and the doctor prescribes a particular vitamin, Bree quickly notes how this helps to make nails stronger. Their reaction to Juno's news about the pregnancy is also very funny.<br /><br />Michael Cera is very good as Paulie, a smart kid, member of the track team and a kid who seems genuinely interested in Juno as a girlfriend, but also as a friend. They really seem to get along together and Paulie is attracted to her. Because he is so sweet, and good-natured, he is also extremely likable. His mother, who clearly doesn't like Juno, puts up with her because she knows her son is attracted to her. He usually makes good decisions, so she gives him the benefit of the doubt. But she isn't beyond giving Juno a dead stare any time she comes to the house. But Juno knows this will happen and simply ignores her until she retreats to Paulie's sanctuary, his bedroom. There, she feels safe.<br /><br />When the two get together, they look at each other, regarding each other with interest, yet unsure how to express this. There is hunger in their eyes, but they haven't had enough experience to know this is a natural thing. Yet.<br /><br />Michael Cera makes Paulie interesting becausehe is clearly going through the same problems all teenage males go through, yet he doesn't quite seem to have the angst we are used to seeing in film characters.<br /><br />Mac accompanies his daughter to their first meeting with Vanessa and Mark, to make sure they don't take advantage of his daughter. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman play the perfect couple. Vanessa feels she was born to be a mother and is kind of desperate to have a baby. Mark seems less gung-ho, but is willing to go along because it is what his wife wants.<br /><br />Vanessa is also a bit weary because they have tried to adopt before only to have the birth mother back out at the last minute. The desperation is very clear, something she is unable to hide with her wide smile. Mark tries to help her deal, but he also seems a bit ambivalent about the whole thing. Or maybe he is just tired.<br /><br />As the pregnancy progresses, Juno decides to drop by and keep the adoptive couple up to date. As she sees more of them, she learns more about them and realizes there are some cracks in the perfect façade. On one of these visits, Juno finds Mark at home alone and learns about some of his hobbies; they have an argument about horror films and Mark shows her one of his favorites. But he is quick to try to rush her out of the house when Vanessa returns home from work.<br /><br />What makes Mark and Vanessa so interesting is a level of unease hinted at throughout their relationship. Mark is concerned about Vanessa finding Juno in their house. Vanessa is desperate to have a child, because they can't seem to conceive. There are other moments which subtly reveal things about Mark and Vanessa, showing that perhaps they aren't as perfect as they seem.<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman, son of Ivan, director of \\"Ghostbusters\\", \\"Dave\\" and many other memorable comedy blockbusters, seems to have a career in his own right. His debut feature \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" was a dark comedy based on the book by Christopher Buckley. A very funny look at the lobbying industry, starring Aaron Eckhart and Catherine Keener, among others, \\"Smoking\\" was easily one of the best of that year. Now, Reitman follows with \\"Juno\\". Both films share an oddball sense of humor, a skewed way of looking at the universe which helps to make the films and stories more interesting. Reitman isn't afraid to let his characters say what they should, nee what they need to, whether it is PC or not. Because of this, his characters seem more real, even though they are incredibly well-spoken and well-versed.<br /><br />In \\"Juno\\", Reitman seems to have found his muse in Ellen Page. As Juno, Page narrates the film providing many insights, acting as the voice for the director and writer. Because she is a teenage girl, her voice is deadpan and frequently conveys she could care less about what she is experiencing. This fits perfectly for her character; a teenager would share these same feelings. Frequently, as she makes an observation, trying to act disdainful of the feeling, she secretly betrays herself and reveals she is excited or afraid or unsure, even if just a little.<br /><br />Reitman and his cast deserve a lot of the credit for making this film work. But the first time screenwriter, Diablo Cody, has also done a remarkable job. From what I understand, Cody, a former exotic dancer of some sort, decided she wanted to become a screenwriter and came up with \\"Juno\\", her first screenplay, which was produced virtually unchanged. She provides these characters with unusual, interesting voices, making the film very funny.<br /><br />Her observations of characters, especially Bree and the Lorings, help to make the film come alive. With these casual asides, we actually learn a lot about the people and what makes them tick. None of them are completely bad; none of them are completely good either.<br /><br />Also, just when it seems like Cody could take the obvious route, making fun of Vanessa and Mark, or Juno's parents, the screenwriter leads us to suspect this is about to happen only to change course and make us laugh at something unexpected. That takes talent.<br /><br />\\"Juno\\" is a very good film, one of the year's best comedies.

B00005JPTI|4.0|\\"I am Legend\\", the third film based on the book by writer Richard Matheson, stars Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville. \\"Legend\\" is a surprisingly good film despite a spectacularly weak ending and easily the best of the three film adaptations.<br /><br />Dr. Robert Neville, an army scientist, is the leading researcher looking for a cure to a virus. The virus once promised to cure cancer, but has ended up killing a large percentage of the population, leaving Robert alone in a virtually deserted New York City. He spends his days exercising with his dog, doing research to try to find a cure and trying to stay alive. I say virtually deserted New York City because at night, he has to barricade himself in his home, ready to fight off the zombie like creatures who come out at night. Portions of the people not killed by the virus have become creatures who hunt at night, feeding on the remaining humans. This situation has also helped to wipe out part of the survivors and made the creatures smarter and more resourceful- as their food supply dwindles, they figure out how to find food, becoming more ruthless, more determined, scarier. Robert knows about these creatures and is determined to protect is anonymity. One day, his dog chases an antelope into a dark building and he runs across a coven of these creatures. Determined to continue his research, he captures one and takes her back to his lab. But nothing seems to work. He continues to send out messages on a radio band and to do his research. But things will change soon, and drastically.<br /><br />Entertainment Weekly recently listed Smith as one of \\"The 50 Smartest People in Hollywood\\". I'm not trying to validate this magazine filler, but they have a point. With remarkably rare exception, Smith has made remarkably well-received films serving to cement his place in the top echelon of actors who command top dollar for their films. Even when the films aren't great, they are fun. So we can possibly forgive him \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" and \\"Wild Wild West\\" because he has given us such hits as the phenomenally successful \\"Independence Day\\", \\"Men in Black\\" and \\"Bad Boys\\". \\"I am Legend,\\" continues this trend, providing Smith with a star vehicle in which is he is virtually the only person on screen for a majority of the film. Because the film has made a lot of money, Smith will receive most of the credit for the film's success.<br /><br />After the virus eradicates much of the world's human population, Robert, somehow immune, continues his research, working very hard to make sure his home remains a safe haven. He checks to almanac to make sure he and Sam, his daughter's dog, return home every day before sunset. He lowers shutters and barricades the door and sleeps in the bathtub, with the dog and a rifle at his side. To maintain his sanity, he watches videotapes of old television and pretends mannequins in a shop are real people, having conversations with them.<br /><br />Because there are no people in New York City, the animals run wild and Robert and Sam are always on the hunt for new game, to supplement their diet. They chase a deer and Sam runs after the deer into a dark building. Robert is reluctant to follow her, but he can't leave his pet, his only daily contact, and his only tie to the past, to fall into the hands of the creatures that take over the night. Sure enough, they run into a group of them and Robert has to try to make it out. Somehow.<br /><br />But Robert is also a scientist, so he returns to set a trap and capture one of them, to run some more experiments. Much like Sam running into the darkened building, the leader of the creatures tries to prevent one of his less intelligent followers from falling into the trap, but is unable to stop her in time.<br /><br />\\"I Am Legend\\" is very good. And it is so good because it convincingly sets up Robert's environment. I still can't figure out how they recreated the vacant, overgrown, slightly battered New York City. Robert races his carthrough empty streets, overgrown with weeds and littered with rusting cars. The filmmakers spent a lot of time and money on the special effects to recreate this. A shot of the bridges leading into Manhattan, both of which were hit by missiles many years ago, is particularly stunning.<br /><br />Smith is virtually the only person on screen for 80% of the film. Can there be any further definition of a star `carrying a film'? Also, because of the leading man's inherent charisma and charm, he commands our attention on the screen and makes us believe he is a scientist capable of finding a cure to a virus that has wiped out 90% of the world's population. How refreshing and different from other actors who pop up and try to portray nuclear scientists or heart surgeons and barely look like they can apply their lipstick or shave.<br /><br />As Smith's Robert Neville moves through his world, a world we are just learning about, he is almost a tour guide for us, introducing us to the various modifications he has made in order to survive. This is a testament to Smith's skill because we never feel as though he is trying to teach us, as though he is on a pulpit explaining things to us. We learn through his actions, his observances, by watching him as he deals with the routine he has set up.<br /><br />Director Francis Lawrence (\\"Constantine\\") paces the film well, catching our attention with an action packed sequence. He fills in the details later. After a brief prologue, we are immediately plunged into Robert's world and watch as he and Sam hunt wild animals. As the film progresses, Robert remembers key events leading to the evacuation of New York, which he refers to as \\"Ground Zero\\" for the virus on more than one occasion. These scenes also give us a look at what happened to his wife and child, giving us more details about how Robert is willing and able to cope with this strange situation.<br /><br />Because we are immediately thrust into this man's current situation, we get a real sense of what he has been living through. This is the majority of his life now, everything else, as important as it was, is now secondary. The filmmakers have placed the emphasis in the right place and make the story all the more engrossing and exciting.<br /><br />There are a couple of enigmatic moments my friends and I have been talking about, because they could mean a couple of different things. Not because they are confusing or uninteresting. These discussions have led all people to have further consideration for each side of the argument. How often do you come out of an action / sci-fi film talking about things, trying to figure them out, having discussions?<br /><br />For all of the work spent on creating a post-apocalyptic New York, some of the CGI character work is less than perfect. The creatures are interesting and \\"Alpha Male\\", as he is listed in IMDB, the leader of these vampire - zombie creatures does seem to have some intelligence, some capability to lead the rest of his coven. But some of these creatures are less convincing than others. Late in the film, the Alpha Male unleashes some of his infected dogs and they are particularly fake looking. So, the CGI is not consistent throughout.<br /><br />And the film begins to fall apart in the last act, leading us to a particularly weak ending.

0440238609|1.0|I looked up \\"His Dark Materials\\" on wikipedia because looking up \\"Philip Pullman\\" didn't give me much information. To my surprise I found a valid claim by Pullman himself that he does speak of a parallel to atheism and the killing of God. Also, that in his books, \\"the devil\\" is portrait as the hero. A copy of the controversy:<br /><br />\\"His Dark Materials has been a subject of some controversy, especially with Christian groups.[13][14] \\"I've been surprised by how little criticism I've got. Harry Potter's been taking all the flak...Meanwhile, I've been flying under the radar, saying things that are far more subversive than anything poor old Harry has said. My books are about killing God.\\"[15]<br /><br />Institutional religion is criticized by some of the characters. For example, Ruta Skadi, a witch and friend of Lyra's calling for war against the Magisterium in Lyra's world, says that \\"For all of [the Church's] history...it's tried to suppress and control every natural impulse. And when it can't control them, it cuts them out.\\" (see intercision). Skadi later extends her criticism to all organized religion: \\"That's what the Church does, and every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling.\\" (By this part of the book, the witches have made reference to how they are treated criminally by the church in their worlds.) Mary Malone, one of Pullman's main characters, states that \\"the Christian religion...is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\" She was formerly a Catholic nun, but gave up her vows when the experience of being in love caused her to doubt her faith.<br /><br />Pullman portrays the Christian heaven to be a lie. In the third book, the real afterlife is depicted as a bleak place where people are tormented by harpies until Lyra and Will descend into the land of the dead. Through their intercession, the harpies agree to stop tormenting the dead souls, and instead receive the true stories of the dead in exchange for leading them again to the upper world. When the dead souls emerge, they dissolve as they become one with the universe.<br /><br />Pullman's \\"Authority\\" is worshipped on Lyra's earth as God, but he turns out to be the first creature to evolve, instead. It is explicitly stated that the Authority was in fact not the creator of worlds. Pullman's trilogy does not speculate on who or what might have created worlds. Members of the Church are typically displayed as zealots. Two characters who once belonged to the Church, Mary Malone and Marisa Coulter, are both displayed in a positive light only insofar as they have rebelled against the Church.[16][17]<br /><br />Cynthia Grenier, in the Catholic Culture, has said: \\"In the world of Pullman, God Himself (the Authority) is a merciless tyrant, His Church is an instrument of oppression, and true heroism consists of overthrowing both.\\"[18] William Donahue of the Catholic League has described Pullman's trilogy as \\"atheism for kids.\\" Pullman has said of Donohue's call for a boycott, \\"Why don't we trust readers? ... Oh, it causes me to shake my head with sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world.\\"[19]<br /><br />Pullman has, however, found support from other Christians, most notably Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who argues that Pullman's attacks are focused on the constraints and dangers of dogmatism and the use of religion to oppress, not on Christianity itself.[20] Pullman himself has said in interviews and appearances[21][22] that his argument can be extended to all religions.

B000002KHB|5.0|You like rock music ? You don't have this cd, well, there is an important part of history missing in your collection. A true classic, a must have.  \\"Highway star, Smoke on the Water, Lazy, Never Before and Space Trucking\\"  Amazing, all these classic are on the same album.  You must own this cd.  Maybe one of the top ten cd on the history of rock music !  PS I also have the DVD audio, the sound is just unbelievable, do yourself a favor, find a good sound system (a surround one of course) and listen to Machine Head in DVD audio, you won't believe it. It is loud, clear and you'll have the impression that it is a recent recording, you then must remember that it a 25 years old recording. Unbelievable.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I am sure I have all these songs 3 or 4 times over, but the collection is fantastic and the sound amazing.   PLEASE go on tour before my knees and joints give out.  Us babyboomers need to look forward to something amazing and our kids are on board too.
1569242739|5.0|I almost never take the time to write reviews, but I have been so impressed with how these recipes turn out that I had to add my praise for the book.    I have only the most basic cooking/baking skills, and these cupcakes came out looking and tasting gourmet. The most common response I got from friends I baked these for was \\"You MADE these!?!?!\\" We started simple with the chocolate, vanilla, and maple flavors, and all 3 turned out perfectly.    As others have said, the icing/frosting recipes alone are worth the price of the book. I bought one of those frosting bags with different shaped metal tips for squeezing out decadent piles of swirling frosting. I recommend you have that tool to make the most of the presentation suggestions this book provides.    If you like cupcakes buy this book! We can't stop baking, and given our previous track record of not-so-great vegan baking experiments, that says a lot!
B00005JOHC|5.0|I have a camp with no tv reception so thought this would help pass the time.<br />I love the show and will watch these episodes many times.<br />Can't wait to get the 2nd season.
B000002KEV|5.0|Another \\"must have\\" album.  Deep Purple Made in Japan.  The choice of songs is perfect, you get amazing live version of classics songs from the band at their peak.  Smoke on the water, Lazy, Highway Star, Child in Time, Strange Kind of Woman...who can ask for more ?  The only negative point is the extra lengh version of Space Trucking, I would have prefer the original version plus one or two more songs of this amazing series of concert in Japan.
B00000F14B|5.0|This DVD was a gift for my husband and he loves it.   The quality was perfect.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|My Son is in love with this movie.<br /><br />It came FAST and in PERFECT condition!
0060776757|4.0|The book is great as far as the content and such.  I was disappointed in the shipping because of the book cover being torn on the one corner.  I wanted to have a new book with no flaws.  I value such things and want my things to be in mint condition when I receive them, especially when I pay top dollar for them.  I expect such things if I am being used, but not new.
B000002KBA|4.0|Superb rock album, one of the first, nearly heavy metal !  Every song is good, Child in Time worth the price of this cd.  Flight the rat is pretty good rock song also, Living Wreck rocks !  Bloodsucker has a good mood also.  My only complaint is the sound, a bit poor but the music is really great.  I think we can say that this cd is the base on which many heavy metal band founds their inspiration.
1594489505|5.0|I loved this book.  All westerners need to read about other nations and try to understand and appreciate what they have
B000P6YNSE|5.0|THIS IS AMAZING. I bought this then i finished it without sleeping a day. HANG ON CLIFFS.
0790729407|5.0|I was unsure about this dvd because I am always unsure about \\"documentary\\" type films. The entire cast was commendable as was the direction by Jordan. My wife and I have read much Irish history in general and this film is worth viewing. Someone complained that you must turn the dvd over to see the final minutes. This is certainly not a detraction as such.
B000A6T262|5.0|This is the probably the best product for die-hard ST and ST:TNG fans.  All the movies with some nice extras.  Decent packaging and good price.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I am mystified by the Pearl Harbor reviews, specifically the good ones.  In short, Pearl Harbor is a hell-stew of ear-shattering volume, wooden acting, laughable dialogue, unfunny humor attempts, and bad history.  Believe all of the negative press and reviews of this movie, it is all true.  In typical Michael Bay fashion, the horror of Pearl Harbor is reduced to a putrid love story and an excuse to make big explosions.  History deserved better than this.
1594489505|5.0|Like most of the reviewers of this book, I am also mesmerized with the story-telling of Khaled Hosseini. No wonder this book has been in the lists of bestsellers. I have also read The Kite Runner and it was because of the Kite Runner book that I was very motivated to read his second book. To be honest, after reading the book, I pray for Lailas and Mariams in Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world who have endured such pain. It brought consciousness to me to be thankful not to experience such humiliation and pain for being born a woman.
0671799320|5.0|It delivers across the board: turgid vignettes of the main players, like Old Mossy; insights into events I lived thru but didn't understand till now, like Nasser and the Suez Canal.  I don't have any complaints really, just two minor ones: the discussion of detailed negotiations tends to be long-winded, but otherwise that's not a problem.  I know this is not a science book, perhaps because Americans tend to be scared by science and chemistry, but I would have loved to have had some chemistry and geology tossed in to replace the overly detailed negotiation accounts.  This is a wonderful book, among the top ten non-fiction books I have ever read.  Yergin has a wonderfully readable style, loads of information that is easily digested.  I heard he was writing a new book about oil, and I am sure it will be great.
0439882826|5.0|I got this for my husband for christmas, I was not sure what to expect.  I think this was his best christmas gift.  Now all of his friends want one.
1589269063|5.0|My cousin's wife gave me this book and after I completely devoured it, I bought more copies for Christmas gifts. Gary Chapman takes a concept as complicated as communication (you wouldn't think it was complicated, but when you're married, or even just in a relationship, everything is more complicated :-) and boils it down to five communication styles. Learn to speak in the language that your partner is most receptive to, and bingo, you're on your way to a happy life. I highly recommend this book!
B000VWYJ8Q|1.0|I have yet to see the end of the movie.<br /><br />Two HD DVD discs have both been defective.<br /><br />Disc freezes and will not continue playing.<br /><br />Amazon have been very good - am waiting for third disc!!!!
B00011F5DK|5.0|As a teacher of special education students, I'm always on the look out for something FUN and that causes students to slow down and think before they make a decision.  This game has been a great tool to teach that concept.  My own 2 elementary age children and my husband and I have played this multiple times together over our vacation time.  It's a game for many ages in a family (my first grader loves it and plays well!) I would recommend this game to any educator or parent.
B000067J1H|5.0|It kind of scary in a \\"this is too familiar\\" way but it also has humor.  Brad Pitt isn't a pretty boy in this one.  His character is kind of cool but a little retarded and whacked out psychologically. Which I liked.<br />I love the story line except the ending but that did not mess up the rest of the movie, at all.  It made sense though.  The whole movie. As strange as it was-it reaches you on a deeper level without being deep or wishywashy/sappy.  I'd say it's a dvd you'd want in your collection. I've seen it 3 times but now I'd like to have it on hand to watch again and again.  Yeah, it's that kind of a movie.<br />ENJOY!!!!!
B000TLTUL0|4.0|Nobody does Dickensian Darkly like Tim Burton. And nobody does tortured dementia quite like Johnny Depp. Put them together in Stephen Sondheim's blood opera and you get the viscous splatter that is \\"Sweeney Todd.\\" While - as many have pointed out - the film deviates from the play on several points, the main thrust of the story remains intact. Depp/Sweeney is out for revenge against the coniving Judge Turpin (a leeringly great Alan Rickman), when he falls in with Mrs Lovett (Helena Bohnam Carter) and the plan to make mincemeat outta the unsavory populous is born.<br /><br />Depp proves his mettle as a musical actor, while his voice has a light tenor to it, he infuses the songs with a dark growl of malevolence. Looking like [[ASIN:B00004U8P8 Edward Scissorhands]] with better hair (or kind of like his character in [[ASIN:0792164903 Sleepy Hollow]]), he also perfectly embodies the Gothic heart that Burton excells in. Only once does this movie even come close to a bright disposition, and that is the satirical \\"By The Sea,\\" sung by Carter.<br /><br />This is also far from what one would call a \\"holiday musical.\\" Unless you would call it a Halloween film. If you're looking for [[ASIN:B000AP04NI Oklahoma!]] or [[ASIN:076781326X Oliver!]], you're in the wrong place. Ditto for everyone carping that Angela Lansbury was so much better...blah blah blah. Reality Check: that was 25 years ago. You really want that version, buy it here: [[ASIN:B00005JL6V Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street]]. This is a different version with a vision not far from that of its creator. Depp and Burton prove to be a daunting team, and their \\"Sweeney Todd\\" adds yet another movie musical (in addition to [[ASIN:B000ZLFALI Across the Universe]] and [[ASIN:B000W4KT6E Hairspray]]) to 2007's list.
B000002HK4|4.0|Was purchased as a gift and the receiver was thrilled, this was the last cd he needed for the Dream Theater Collection.  As always, couldn't have asked for more from Dream Theater.
0891419195|4.0|If you read only half the book you have read the book.  It is a day-to-day, battle-to-battle account of part of WWII in the Pacific.  The raw and valorous emotions and acts in the face of fear are graphically shocking, deeply depressing and, except for some behavioral mishaps, proudly honorable.<br /><br />This is almost a diary--yes, the author forbiddenly took notes--that carries you into battle, causes you to flinch, and fills you with empathy for the survivors of these hellish battles and grief for the honorable dead.<br /><br />The pattern of the book tends to unfold repetitiously and predictably.  Nevertheless, the writing style draws the reader along at a fast pace.  The print is tiny, so bump that 300 pages to 600 for some other books.  The only real negative I have of the book is that most of the pictures could have been left out since they are either so poorly reproduced or very war-time generic.
0316066524|3.0|i'm amazed by the diverse range of topics and situations that David Foster Wallace can go into realistic descriptive detail on, it's like he has a hidden camera and microphone on every person in the world and he can just pull a random file from his database every time he needs a new character or situation for a story, but I wonder how much of it comes from instinctive insight and how much from research, and whether any average writer couldn't essentially achieve the same result if they were willing to invest enough time and effort.   i went back and forth between loving Infinite Jest and hating it, probably eventually spending more time, if not hating it, at least annoyed by it.   after the first 200 pages i thought this was going to be a book i could generalize about but it isn't. like every novel I've ever found any value in this one can be evenly divided into worthwhile parts and throwaways. pages 435-503 (and at least a third of the chapters thereafter) are nothing more than generic functional writing and a drag to get through, warranting skimming. there are also a few depraved horror-scenarios, as well as plenty of racism/sexism/homophobia that i'm surprised gets no mention as an issue against the book while the endnotes constantly do. the author enjoys racial slurs so much he even invents one for canadians.   the further you get through the book the less new ideas there are, the plottier it gets, and the more typically novelish it gets, baiting you with constant cliffhangers and just generally being vague and cryptic. regressing to the kind of writing that implies everything and specifies nothing, to the point that you inevitably start drawing the wrong implications from things, and when you realise that's what you've done you just stop trying to focus, accept that 25% of the text will be lost on you, being unable to work out how one sentence (or part thereof) correpsonds to another regardless of how many times you re-read it in a row, and race to the end to get it over with trusting that whatever's significant will stick.   If you have an impulse to put the book down at the halfway mark because it feels like it's winding down i say go with it, you won't miss much. When DFW is on he's untouchable, but the other half of this book seems thoughtlessly tossed off.
B000VR824S|5.0|Crossroads Guitar Festival 2007 is a great celebration and production of guitar music.  Eric Clapton had assembled the best guitarists of our time The concert is put together very well and very entertaining. The DVD gets off to a great start with Sonny Landreth and 4hrs later winds up with Clapton,Cray,Vaughan and Winter doing \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\".  This is a dvd that you will want to watch over and over again ....I know I have.
0553565915|5.0|The book inspired me to be a better person and to consider my actions more thoroughly.  It was hard to put down, and is reassuring about death and what lies beyond.  I'm not sure what motivation the author would have had to make it up, so I hope she didn't; it is a wonderful read.
0307237699|4.0|This was a very interesting read.  Obama really explained life the behind politics making him seem like a really likable man.  He answered questions broad enough to where you could see the difficulties in making some tough decisions while narrow enough you could see his stance.  I know that I would vote for him to be the next president.

0743298039|2.0|I don't know how long it has been since I started a book I abandoned before the end. I struggled to reach even page 246 in The Thirteenth Tale, at which time I took another look at the book on the table and realized there was no good reason to pick it up again, save to place it back on the shelf. I can't tell you the relief I felt once I did, finally having the thing out of my life.    I can't understand all the positive reviews for this boring book.  I simply could not get myself to care about any of these characters.  This book is so bland and the characters have no sizzle to them. These are boring people, even if they are heavy with idiosyncracies.  Being odd, doesn't make one interesting. One small life after another does not involve me in a book. And the plot... what plot?      Let's see, a boring woman who has spent her entire life lost in the make believe world of books instead of creating any sort of real life for herself is asked to write the biography of a prolific writer who was once a rotten little kid from a mentally ill family. End of story, if only it would end. Instead it goes on and on revealing this. It actually took 246 pages to reveal no more plot than this, which was pretty much all summed up in Amazon's editorial review. Oh and there's a ghost. I guess that adds the interesting twist, only NOT.    If you like boring books that show great technical writing skill but no substance, this is the one for you.
1574535811|5.0|This book is one I wish I could put into everyone's hand.  It is the most comprehensive book of it's kind, supported by a mountain of research.  No quacks here, just facts that can change the quality of your life!  I recommend the cd to accompany it. I will not part with this one and refer to it frequently.

B000AGTPUK|5.0|We love the movie and plan to establish watching it as an annual holiday tradition.  Tom Hanks is great as a number of characters in this movie.  While the computerized images are not 100% lifelike, they're certainly very close, and good enough (though the Santa Claus seemed a little less so).
0312360266|4.0|It took a while to get into this book, but if you can get by the hoaxy spirits and such, its pretty good. It captured my attention and I ended up reading it in one sitting. You probably feel stupid after reading it, but you will have to read whatever comes next.

B000VLE3GA|5.0|I've bought every Zep release since 1969 and have heard these songs many times, but have to admit that after much skepticism, I purchased this CD today and was blown away. These are the finest sounding cuts on Zepplin I've ever heard. Of course, there will be missing favorites. But this selection of tunes are those that have stood the test of time and is a super introduction to new fans or for those who don't want to buy all their albums and an excellent representation of their innovative talents for older fans as well. If you could have only 1 Led Zeppelin CD, this has got to be the one! There is more seperation, clarity and crispness along with overall volume on all of these. Jimmy Page may be the greatest rock guitarist of them all and Robert Plant is the greatest banshee wailer of all time. He's amazing, really! Just listen!

1878424777|5.0|My therapist recommended this and after listening to the audiobook only one time, I have already noticed a difference. It's especially helpful for people (like me) who take everything personally (the second agreement). I have dreaded the holidays for years because of an ongoing fight that my inlaws have with each other. It doesn't involve me but I always felt their pain, maybe even more than they did. This year, I just felt sorry for them (and kind of tired of hearing about it). The four agreements are a lot to take in at once but I believe they are all important and I plan to incorporate them into my life.
B000UR9QHQ|1.0|This review is for the high definition disc only. This is a really good movie that is one of the standards of excellence for very low budget motion pictures, but this high definition transfer is unwatchable. The colors are ugly and wrong. In addition, the excessive use of digital grain reduction technology has both softened the picture and robbed it of much of the detail in the image. Looks like something that was done by amateurs on a home system. Extremely poor and should be avoided -- The worst transfer to high def disc that I have seen.<br /><br />Update: Note that in 2013 a new transfer of the original \\"Halloween\\" was released on Blu-ray. I understand that it is much better than the old one that I reviewed.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I am one of the obsessed.  From the first time I saw this film, it became the frame of reference for my world view. It was really the first film that I deeply identified with it's themes, what is it to be a human? Is it the genetic heritage or is it the human virtue? The film's production values stunned me like no other film that I've ever watched. I was seduced by Vangelis' hypnotic and moody soundtrack.  It can be argued as one of the best film scores of all time.  Deckard and I, we are simpatico. Thank you Phil, Hampton, David, Michael and the rest--anyone who helped bring this vision into our consciousness--especially Ridley-you guys are my heros.  Thank you for this final cut, it is a gorgeous version. The extras in this collector's edition are full of great information on how the film came about and what it was like for those involved. This film has always left me with a thirst for more.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|should've excluded that horrible 'ain't it fun' and 'since i don't have you' and substituted 'estranged' instead, then the list would basically be perfect. 'breakdown' or 'rocket queen' could be on here also, but 'sympathy for the devil' is a good cover so i don't mind.    the only other problem is the volume on 'patience' is too low, especially sandwiched between 'sweet child' and 'paradise city' which are both very loud. hard to listen straight through the beginning without having to adjust the volume in order to be able to hear patience.
B000YA9R3C|5.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is probably the absolute best film of the year, and this is due to more than the extraordinary talent of Daniel Day-Lewis. At its core, it tells a story of insatiable greed, of how the lust for absolute power can drive anyone into a state of pure evil. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel \\"Oil!\\" the descent of oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (Lewis) is long and slow, but it's definitely constant--he starts off in 1902 with drive, passion, and charisma, only to lose himself to hate, arrogance, and a complete lack of decency by 1927. By the end of the film, absolutely nothing about this man is likeable, and one gets the sense that he wanted it that way all along: \\"I hate most people,\\" he says at one point. \\"I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.\\" Here's a character that can't be pitied, simply because he created exactly what he wanted for himself.    The first ten minutes of \\"There Will Be Blood\\" contains no dialogue, but it still manages to establish a cohesive story. It begins in 1898, during which a lone prospector digs for oil in the mountainous deserts of Texas. By 1902, an entire team led by Plainview has made camp in the area and has successfully struck oil. One day, a well accident kills one of the workers, leaving an infant boy without his father. For as yet unknown reasons--be they selfless or selfish--Plainview decides to care for the boy and raise him as his own. The story then flashes forward to 1911, which opens with Plainview trying to negotiate a deal with the locals of a small town. When the deal falls through, Plainview is introduced to Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), a young man from a small community called Little Boston; he offers Plainview his family's property in exchange for a handsome sum of money. Apparently, that property is rich with oil.    Without missing a beat, Plainview and his son, H.W. (Dillon Freasier), enter Little Boston posing as quail hunters. After discovering that the Sunday property does, indeed, contain oil,and after setting up camp with his team, Plainview gets acquainted with the devoutly religious Sunday family. The son, Eli (also played by Paul Dano), is thought to be a spiritual healer, and he shows this side of himself during some passionate church meetings. He and Plainview share an interesting relationship, to say the least; Plainview initially states that he likes all churches and thus doesn't belong to any specific sect of Christianity, but as the film progresses, it's obvious that church--or more specifically, God--has not and never will be a part of his life. Eli, who believes he has the power to heal his fellow parishioners, falls into disfavor when H.W. has an oil-related accident that can't be healed.    Things take an unexpected turn when a man claiming to be Plainview's long lost half brother enters the picture. His name is Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor), and he's come from a job in New Mexico to be a part of Plainview's life, to work for him and help him find more oil. Something about him clearly isn't right from H.W.'s point of view, and he makes this clear through a drastic act I won't reveal. I will say that, as time goes on, Plainview also begins to suspect Henry, which actually isn't saying a whole lot since his very nature is to be distrustful. One understands this all throughout the film--with even the subtlest of expressions, Plainview can easily express the anger, hostility, and fear that are slowly taking control. It seems all he has left is to let himself be manipulated, especially by Eli: if he wants permission to run an oil pipe through a piece of property he doesn't own, he must agree to be baptized in Eli's church. And as you might expect, Eli will actually be leading the ceremony. Watching Plainview being forced to say things he doesn't believe is a mesmerizing experience, not only because it foreshadows what lies ahead, but also because the scene is incredibly intense.    Pretty much the same thing can be said about the entire film, whichthrives on tension despite appearing to be low-key. One of Lewis' expressions is an almost frightening counterpoint to Johnny Greenwood's score, a Bernard Hermann-inspired opus of screeching, tremulous strings. Such music is heard even during the \\"calmer,\\" \\"insignificant\\" moments, such as shots of Plainview walking from one room to another. This would be inappropriate were this any other film. But this isn't any other film; \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is all about expressing Plainview's emotional turmoil, and as such, it's easy to believe that he's never had a quiet moment in his head. It's also easy to believe that entering his mind would be one of the most terrifying experiences imaginable, not just because of his contempt for humanity, but also because of the depths to which his contempt will sink him.    The final twenty minutes of this film takes place in 1927, at which point Plainview is more morally than physically aged. He's rich beyond his wildest dreams, yet he's emotionally bankrupt, and this is shown through two brief but significant meetings. I won't describe what happens or reveal whom he speaks to, but I will say he does everything he can to make everyone hate him, including us. In essence, we hate him just as much as he hates himself, which isn't pathetic so much as it's detestable. I realize that such an ending is not a typical crowd pleaser, but considering the story that's being told, typical doesn't apply, here. This goes double for Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, one of the best I've seen in a long time. To sum everything up with a brief phrase, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is an absolutely brilliant film.

B000002UA2|4.0|I just recently decided to pick up two of Pink Floyd's lesser known releases, \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" and \\"Meddle.\\"  This one, the soundtrack for the film \\"La Vallee\\", is a soild effort from Floyd.  Four of the ten tracks are instrumentals.  In fact, the album starts with two of them, the title track and \\"When You're In.\\"  The first track with lyrics is the gentle \\"Burning Bridges\\" with David Gilmour and Richard Wright sharing lead vocals.  The next cut is the hardest rocking song on the album \\"The Gold It's In The...\\" with Gilmour strutting his stuff on guitar.  \\"Wots...Uh The Deal\\" and \\"Stay\\", the latter featuring a rare solo lead vocal performance by Wright, are also nice ballads.  \\"Free Four\\", where Roger Waters looks into life and death, has an almost jolly beat behind some rather morbid lyrics.  Waters mentions his father's death in World War II in this song when he sings \\"You are the angel of death/And I am the dead man's son/He was buried like a mole in a foxhole/And everyone's still on the run.\\"    Overall, while not a masterpiece like \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", this is still a very good album and a worthy addition to your Pink Floyd collection.
B000W0NO5Q|5.0|I wish there were 100 books in this series...pure charm and delight.  Mma Ramotzwe's world is peopled overwhelmingly with folks who mean well. I love her point of view.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Magic is one of Bruces' better efforts since the epic CD Born In the USA. Quite possibly his hardest rockin' album to date. Includes one of my favorite songs of 2007...Radio Nowhere. Suggested for those who liked Tunnel of Love, The River or The Seeger Sessions. Other stellar tracks: Girls In Their Summer Clothes, You'll Be Comin' Down & the title track. This CD includes all the Springsteen staples: great riffs, an amazing voice, wonderful melody & last but not least the E Street Band!
B000TLTUL0|5.0|When I first heard that Tim Burton was making the film version of the broadway musical classic \\"Sweeney Todd,\\" I laughed out loud. And, that he was casting his longtime leading man Johnny Depp in the lead, and his wife Helena Bonham Carter as the demented pie maker? There's no way this would work. Boy, am I glad when I'm proven soooo wrong.     The film is a musical-horror classic--overflowing with atmosphere, extremely gory, and brimming with superlative performances all around. The set decoration and cinematography should win Oscars. Depp and Bonham Carter should receive nominations.     Wonderful production all the way around, I can't wait to see it again.     Bravo!

B000K7VHQ4|3.0|While watching THE ILLUSIONIST, I couldn't help but compare it to another movie that came out in the fall of 2006, THE PRESTIGE. Both films featured magicians at the turn of the century. Both are amazing to watch, the cinematography takes you to another world. The acting is top notch in THE PRESTIGE, but in the ILLUSIONIST, Edward Norton as the great Eisenhiem, seems very wooden and his accent is also annoying.<br /><br />THE PRESTIGE featured plot twists after plot twists, the movie constantly shifted and left you feeling confused at the end. THE ILLUSIONIST moves slowly, taking its time to tell its story of love. Eisenhiem and Sophie (Jessica Beil) knew each other as children, but because they were from different social classes, they could never be together. Eisenheim returns after a 15 year absence and finds Sophie is soon to be engaged to the future emperor of Austria, the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell.)<br /><br />Leopold doesn't want the two to be together and a confrontation ensues. Paul Giamatti plays the police inspector who has a lot to gain by shutting Eisenhiem down, but knows what an evil person Sewell's character can be. While THE PRESTIGE is a complex movie that focuses on magic and the extent magic and deception can be used to manipulate lives, THE ILLUSIONIST is really a love story with magic only coming into play occasionally.<br /><br />The Illusionist tells a simple story with a twist at the end. The twist didn't shock me, I saw it coming. It was believable and made the monotonous hour and a half before it that much more enjoyable. This is a good movie to rent, but one you won't really want to watch more than once, so I don't recommend buying it.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is a watershed album, one of Wilco's best.  It's also one of the most adventurous albums in the last 10 years or so, incredibly eclectic and meticulously produced and performed.  As many Wilco fans already know, it almost didn't get released because Wilco's original label, Reprise (a label who is supposedly \\"artist friendly\\") decided that the album was too out there.  Well, luckily, Nonesuch (a real artist friendly label that has released many Philip Glass works) picked this album up, and all those who rejected this album at Reprise should be ashamed.<br /><br />Jeff Tweedy (who really is the heart and soul of Wilco) is one of the greatest American songwriters today.  Here he doesn't disappoint.  This album reminds me of Sgt. Pepper in a way, in that the album has an experimental concept/vibe and beauty to it, much like the more famous Beatles album.  Tweedy and Wilco have always had wonderful harmony in their songs (especially their most recent album, Sky Blue Sky), and here they do as well.  But they have that aggressive, avant garde style too, which really comes to the fore with the beginning track, I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.  After a powerful first half of the song, it breaks into a beautiful tapestry of distortion, one that I wish went on longer (there's a distortion track called Less than You Think on the follow up to this, but I Am Trying to Break Your Heart is better).  The next song, Kamera, is a much more melodic song, but still excellent.  Radio Cure gets a little dark and noisy again, and I love Jesus, Etc., one of Wilco's best tunes and kind of a signature song/hit for them.  I love the closer Reservations too.  I've never been disappointed by any Wilco album.  From A.M. to Sky Blue Sky (and beyond), I think they'll always do something worthwhile.  This is one of their best albums, and I'm glad to see Wilco continuing in their experimental ways.
B00006CXSS|5.0|What an excellent series.  Would highly recommend this to anyone that likes war movies and a lot of history on the wars.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I have four children who are messy eaters and messy crafters.  We rent and this house has carpet in every room, including the dining room and kitchen.  Until I got my Swivel Sweeper, I had to lug my vacuum out every day, sometimes multiple times each day.  Otherwise, food and craft items would get ground into the carpet and I'd have to shampoo it frequently.  It was a real pain.    My mom gave me the Swivel Sweeper nearly two months ago after she got the buy-one-get-one deal from the infomercial.  I have to tell you that I am in love with this thing.  When she first gave it to me I thanked her but truly expected it to be a piece of junk that wouldn't pick anything up.  Boy, was I ever wrong!  Cereal, raisins, bits of construction paper, wiggly eyes; it picks it all up beautifully and no longer do I have to lug out my vacuum every day.      It's for quick clean-ups and I have not had any problem with the battery running out quickly.  I usually get multiple trips through the dining room and kitchen before having to charge the battery.  The catch tray pops out for easy dumping and easy checking for things you don't want to throw away (like the wiggle eyes and my daughter's tiny Pony World pieces).  I like that it comes with a tool to rip hair and string off the rollbars with.  Every vacuum should come with such a tool.  It's really just a seam ripper; you can get one at any sewing store, but it is convenient that it actually comes with one and, quite frankly, I hadn't thought about using one for this purpose previously.    I find the Swivel Sweeper to be sturdy and reliable.  My kids love to use it when they clean their rooms, as well, and they aren't exactly kind to it.  They bump it into beds and walls and it's still working fine and still unbroken.  I would certainly recommend this to any parent.
B00027JYLC|4.0|This movie was recommended by a friend and at first, I did not know if I wanted to see it.  It is incredible.  For a movie made in the 1930's, it is incredible.  It pushes the envelope for today's standards so I can only imagine the stir it created when it was made.  It is a great movie.  You have got to see it to believe it.
B0001BKAEE|4.0|Husband loved this gift.  Great action movie and love story....
B000VWYJ86|4.0|I like it. This is simply a good movie. It fills with exciting scenes. The movie takes place on many countries including New York, New York in the US. For the acting, Matt Damon always rocks as Jason Bourne and this time is no exception. For the direction, it is all make sense. For the visuals, it rocks all the way. Overall, a great movie.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|The Wachowski Brothers deliver another great movie.  Not just action, but as always a great plot.  Guys and girls alike will enjoy this movie.
B000W1V5VU|4.0|This movie is such a good movie. It is the best of all three other Ocean's series. I like this movie because the story plotline, the visuals and the directions are good. Also, some scenes are funny as well. Ocean 12 and 13 are a bit boring. However, this movie can do its job. Overall, good movie.
0375505091|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my Grandaughter. She absolutely loves it and her Father loves it also.  She is on the year book staff and is really in to photography for the Year Book.  It is a great book
B000MNP2KI|5.0|After a long 4 years of waiting, the new James Bond movie is finally released. Well, this is simply a very good movie for my point of view. Daniel Craig is simply a best bond character since Sean Connery.
0307387151|3.0|I wanted to love this book, instead I just \\"kind of\\" liked it. Yes, the writing is elegant and descriptive, but the story doesn't realize it's potential. There is much left unsaid, and your curiosity is never satisfied. I found myself wanting to learn about these characters, and instead, I got a lot of information about scenery. Very long drawn out descriptions of scenery.....      Often, I would put this book down for days at a time, then pick it up again. When I realized I was almost at the end of the book and still really hadn't found out much about the main story line, I was a little disappointed. A good portion of the book was dedicated to the battle scenes, which were not very clear. I found myself spacing off while reading it, thinking about housework I had to do and what-not.       I think you can have \\"good writing\\" and still tell a compelling story. I don't think this book hit on both of those aspects. One for sure, but not the other.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This movie is simply a masterpiece. As everybody know, this movie is simply a Hollywood version of \\"Infernal Affairs\\". It is a good translating as I can see. All people act good. I loved it!
B00005JPLW|4.0|Overall, an excellent video experience.  My only complaint is historical accuracy of the clothing worn by the Spartans.  The director made an arbitrary decision to do away with the traditional Spartan armor, and portray the Spartans minimum clothing.      Very well done.  Would love to see it in wide screen, 3D.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|After more than 10 years, Bruce Willis's Die Hard finally returns this year. I am so looking foward to see this new movie. After I watch it, it doesn't disappoint me. It is a good movie and I like it. The main reason is it is exciting and intense from start to finish. It never gets bored. Compare to other Die Hard series, I can say this is the best because the storyline is fully developed and there are no boring scenes. For the acting, Bruce Willis rocks for his role of John McClane. He never gets old of playing this role for more than 15 years. For the direction, it is good. For the visuals, they are simply fantastic. The explosive scenes are so great. Overall, it is a great movie.<br /><br />DVD: This 2-disc special edition is simply good because the 2nd disc of the special features are very good.  I like the trailers.
B000VUDSH6|3.0|I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan, and this movie does deliver on its promise that it has some of his best stunt work in recent years. The fight scenes bring back memories of the old Police Story films, with fast and furious fighting all around. There's definitely better fight scenes here than in the recent Rush Hour 3 movie.<br /><br />So what's the problem? For one thing, this movie is uneven on every level. It's not funny enough to be called a comedy, though there are some funny moments. It's too melodramatic to be taken seriously as a drama. The action scenes are amazing, but take forever to occur. The feeble attempts at romance are laughable. The plot is weird, and the ending is way too over the top (try hooking yourself up to a car battery to see if it's really possible).<br /><br />While I did enjoy parts of this film a lot, there were a few too many stumbling blocks to call it a perfect film. Still, if you're tired of the \\"safe\\" action Jackie's had in many of his recent films, this will feed your need for adrenaline...you just may have to fast forward quite a bit to hit the good stuff.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|If you're looking for a heart-warming story of a family on the road to exciting adventures where they each learn something new about themselves along the way, you've come to the right place.  Sort of.    The way this defective family learns to band together during an exhaustingly odd road trip will leave you with smiles, tears and a better view of your own family.    The casting is A+ with Greg Kinnear as an overbearing failure at perfection, Toni Collette as a loving mother trying to hold it all together, Alan Arkin, the pot smoking, tell-it-like-it is grandfather, Steve Carell, the suicidal gay uncle, Paul Dano as the silent, moody teen, and the ever wonderful Abigail Breslin as Olive, the spunky, happy-go-lucky girl with big dreams.     This was a movie I wasn't big on seeing at first, but was glad I did.  It turned out to become one of my favorites!

B00005JNBQ|1.0|You can only have one of two reactions to this film: love or loathing.    Some people love this film on the basis of its \\"dead-pan\\" humor.  Those of us with sense realize that this film lacks any humor at all.  What the former type of viewer has mistaken for humor is a condescending hatred of its own characters.  People who like this film just enjoy laughing at nerds.  It's actually that simple.    There's no plot.  The characters, pathetic as they begin, never develop.  The so-called jokes are so dry that one feels the sensation of dying in the desert as the writers senselessly destroy the spirits of their own characters.  Even the dancing climax that audiences seem to adore really just comes across as another opportunity to watch the nerd suck at life.    \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" should be wiped from the face of the Earth in the name of good film.
1594489505|5.0|Great to be able to see these toons again after all these years.  So glad I bought it from this supplier, as it seemed that no sooner had I ordered it, it was here.  Thanks.

1400064287|5.0|The Heath brothers present us with an amazing title that automatically becomes an essential part of the toolkit of any marketer or anyone seeking to influence others. Complementing very nicely the concepts introduced a while back by Gladwell in \\"The Tipping Point\\", this title offers the reader a very easy-to-follow framework to help in the creation of sticky ideas.<br /><br />Each chapter focuses on one of the six dimensions of the framework (SIMPLE, UNEXPECTED, CONCRETE, CREDIBLE, EMOTIONAL and STORIES) which you can easily remember through the acronym SUCCESs. They spice up each element with examples to illustrate the points they make, building up on the concepts covered earlier on and periodically inserting what they call clinics, which are great stopping points to see the new material put in practice.<br /><br />The end-result is a sticky book that you will devour in no time (as powerful of a methodology they present, they don't take too long to do it -thus applying their own method, making the content CONCRETE). It will also be a book that you will find yourself applying instantly to whatever idea you want to influence others about, whether you are presenting in person to an audience of investors or to over the TV in the form of a commercial.

6305882592|5.0|Harold and Maude is our family's favorite, from the 15yo son to 61yo dad.  It's a wonderful story, good acting and terrific soundtrack.  I like how it breaks the norm of social perceptions.  This movie was a groundbreaker when it was made and even now, in an age of anything goes, especially on the big screen, brooches a subject seldom if ever addressed.  If you're sick of the pandering of contemporary movie making, treat yourself to Harold and Maude.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|We had to have the final episode in the Bourne trilogy. This is the best suspense/spy thriller of all and we never tire of watching it. Non-stop action, tricks and turns around each corner. Ludlow can't be beat.
