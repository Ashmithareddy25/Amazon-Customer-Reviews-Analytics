B005K0HDGE|5.0|I will have to admit (although people will probably think that I'm crazy), but this was the first ever SK book I have ever read. I, for one, am not a big book reader to say the least. Usually when I start to read a book, I lose interest. That, however, was not the case with this book. I was truly captivated throughout the magnificent journey that is this book. It took me about four weeks to read it, as I have a very busy schedule with not a lot of downtime. I must say that my next Kindle purchase will probably be a King book. His character building is phenomenal. I do not know how this particular book stacks up against his other works, but I cannot emphasize enough how much I truly enjoyed this book. I will say that I made time to read the last 100 pages in one night. I just couldn't put it down. I am pretty sure that this would be a box office smash if it were ever made into a movie. Of course, a lot would rely on the cast of characters and director.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great selection of different mini games. would like to see a sequel. fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.
B00004VVN9|5.0|Thank you for the movie Brainstorm.  It came on time and in perfect condition.  Great service and product.  Thank you very much.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really loved this game. get it for sure.  I usually get the free ap a day, and so far this one is my favorite.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I admit it. When I started reading this book it was mainly curiosity since I had seen the trailer for the movie and heard some of the hype associated with it. But I was quickly drawn into Katniss' and Peeta's world and I didn't want to leave.<br />The author did an amazing job in finding the right voice to tell this story. I didn't feel like a single word was wasted, although I admit to skimming some parts of the trilogy because I was so anxious to find out what happened next :)<br />While this series is given a \\"Grade 7 & up\\" reading level, I wouldn't necessarily give it to a middle schooler. The author handles certain distasteful elements rather well, but this is a book (series) that you almost have to absorb. It's very captivating, which is good, but as an adult I felt a little overwhelmed. In lieu of that, I think letting older teens read this would be best.<br />Kudos to Suzanne Collins for this extraordinary book/series. Fiction as good as this is hard to come by.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the variety of games. I know the app is free but I do not like having to play the few games that I don't care for to get to the other 100 games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Personally. I think this game is amazingly awesome. I play it all the time. if you really like playing a lot of games I would download this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101-in-1 Games is a fun, not too difficult game. You have to get points by beating the games that are available,  in order to use the points to purchase new games. It is fun when you have some time to kill.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've just finished the third book of the trilogy and I will say I loveeee it! The first book was my favorite though. The games itself was so detailed I could clearly picture it in my mind. Saying that, when I saw the trailer for the movie I was like WHATT that is so not how I picture the characters. But anyways, definately an amazing read and you will be buying the second and third as soon as you finish this one. It's addicting and I'm sad it's over for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so funn! there is so many different games to chose from and they are fun. you will love it like I do peace out love this is why I'm hot!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the entire series, but especially how the author wrapped up this wonderful tale. Because I was so attached to Peeta and Katniss, I didn't want to let go and finish their story. But all good things come to an end including this book and series.  The author did a great job including different twists in the story. I felt completely drawn into everything that happened to Katniss. At one point I wanted to cry and I don't typically cry when I read. But Katniss stayed strong when most people would have curled up and died.   Many kudos to Ms. Collins for the ending. It's hard to know how to conclude a work. And I'm sure that a story like this one was even harder to wrap up. I felt though that she gave everyone the appropriate ending. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that it was a realistic ending. Maybe not as neat as everyone would hope for, but definitely an ending worthy of our heroes, Peeta and Katniss. And may I also say that I was hoping Katniss would end up with whom she did. Somewhere around the second book, maybe the third, I knew that he was the one for her. And their words to each other, while brief, are absolutely characteristic of them and pack a huge punch of meaning. Seriously, if you weren't satisfied by the ending I suggest rereading it but look between the lines at what isn't said. I'm very sad to say goodbye to Peeta and Katniss and the others. But I'm very glad that I was able to read their story because it was a story worth reading.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun and are good time killers.  The instructions could be more detailed however they are easy to catch on too.  They could be more challenging.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|I love dark movies on occasion, but The Dark Knight was just too dark. In a world that's as bleak and hopeless as ours, it's important that good defeats evil in a significant way. Sadly, the movie's antagonist is just a little too efficient; a little  too prescient for a ranting mad man, while Batman, for all his gadgets and intelligence, is just too incompetent and clueless. (Part of the way through, I kept hoping that Spider-man would swing in and save the day!) Ordinarily, someone who appears in a costume in a movie is the hero. But in this case it's an embarrassment. The body count of those Wayne should have been protecting rises too precipitously for a movie of this type. Who wants to put their faith in a superhero when those who are counting on that hero are dropping like flies? I'd rather put my faith in Adam West and Burt Ward!! In fact, those who have never seen The Dark Knight should consider the quote from the old Batman series, where the sagacious Adam West tells Robin: \\"Don't dip your oar in this sordid sea, Dick. You might be besmirched!\\"
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very fun to play, smooth gameplay. interface is easy to use and the levels progress at a fair rate. Overall great app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so much to choose from! I think that there are games for everyone- boys and girls and various ages. I definitely reccomend this game!
B005OOL1IC|1.0|This was the most disappointing Movie Ever. The story line was exactly the same as the original they woke up having lost one of the group and could not remember anything. I only managed to watch 1/4 and turned it off it was that bad. What a waste of my hard earned money.  Adrian
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I put this on a dead gpu, which i baked to bring it back to life, and it has been working for about a month.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is one of the best thing that I've ever watched on Pacific fighting during WWII. The series features many well known characters of the war such as Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie, and John Basilone. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I hope that anyone who reads this will take deep consideration in the product. If you wish to learn more you can read books written by some of the characters portrayed in the series. It really goes deep in how the war was in the eyes of the average GI. It is a very moving series, but I highly suggest that you don't watch this with children as there are a few \\"controversial\\" scenes that might take a while to explain to the younger children or the occasional immature adult.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|At first I wondered why all the negative reviews.  But, then, this is a movie about regrets-- after all, that's what \\"stains\\" are, isn't it, things we regret . . . AND THEIR BEING \\"HUMAN\\" ONLY MAKES THEM OURS AND HENCE EVEN MORE SO . . . REGRETTABLE, THAT IS.    I guess it comes down to where one is in his/her life, as well as where one's life is in the range of human existence, to determine what type and amount of tragedy one's narrative sense can tolerate.  Hence, for some people, I'm sure, \\"The Human Stain\\" just has too much, and too many kinds, of drama packed in to bear.  We have an advanced classics professorial career brought down by a casual remark taken for racism . . . irony of ironies, he's Black passing for white Jewish, but he won't give up his masquerade (and his rage at what he seeks to escape through passing is articulated through his early years as a winning boxer).  He seeks comfort in the embrace of a half-his-age woman who seeks herself escape from an abusive marriage and feel responsible for the death of her children . . . as well as being pursued by her ex-- in fact, it all starts with the professor and his mate dying in an accident intended to avoid an oncoming truck (which, it turns out, was driven by the ex).  And the story is told by an Viet-vet writer who has grown too callused from all the killing to feel any more.  People today are quick to use the phrase, \\"That's more information than I wanted,\\" so I can understand some viewers declaring: \\"That too much drama for one lifetime, much less one movie!\\"    So here you are. How old are you? How much life have you been through? How much and how often have you seen tragedy happen ALL AT ONCE . . . or interconnected? Etc, etc, etc.  Most people lose it if a narrative has more than one story line.  They can't keep track of the events-- NOT \\"cognitive\\" track, but \\"emotional\\" track.  That is to say, they can't bring themselves to care about so many evolving lives spinning out of control in one film.  One is reminded here of the movie \\"Traffic,\\" which brings you several story lines, but unravels them only one at a time before bringing them all together at the end.  Not here; so your heart strings are kept in a constant state of pulled, first to the right, then to the left, and simultaneously all around as well.  Outstanding war movies do that as battlefield events spare no one with the randomness of anonymously flying bullets.  Well, things sort of evolve that way here, with no end in sight in how many victims are rolled up along the way.    To me, I've been through such a wide range of experience, and I'm of an age where I have had an awful lot of it-- and, to top it off, I'm a psychotherapist, so I've had to take in and process a heck of a lot of other people's tragedy-- that I felt some relief seeing things portrayed on the screen a bit like they are etched on my soul.  You don't have to be depressed to connect with the tragic, BUT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WELL TRAVELED!!!    This movie will certainly test and separate boys and girls from men and women in the amount and extent of gravity it has managed to pack in one continuous narrative-- sort of like sitting on Jupiter as opposed to Earth. For example, it calls upon one to have a multidimensional sense of the Black-American experience, as well as its not-always-mutually-satisfying intersections with that of American Jewry-- the author of the original book is Phillip Roth, and the film was made by Robert Benton (of \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\" or \\"Places in the Heart\\" acclaim)-- so one is certain to have his/her unilinear/'good-guys-victims\\" vs. \\"bad-guys-perpetrators\\" conception of social issues and movements shot to Hell.  Then there's the matter of older guy with younger woman: that gets played to a high tension in this flick (with an relatively unspoken racial sexuality touch).  And we end with a killing that can't be pinned on the killer because \\"I didn't kill them . . . they killed themselves!\\" (and he ACTUALLY manages to make it stick, to the utter consternation of all movie goers used to The Code's expectation that Justice will always be portrayed to win out in the end).  Nobody wins here, and American movie goers so love to see a winner!!    I don't want to come off pompous, but this movie is definitely one for MATURE tastes.  You have to have been around the block a few times and find yourself with a lot less to show for it than you would have thought you would when you began your journey.  And then there's the matter of age . . . that is, reaching the stage of one's life where the horizon no longer keeps backing up and disappearing behind the vanishing point as you proceed forwards-- i.e., the end first starts becoming visible, and then starts to stay that way no matter what.  In youth it keeps retreating behind the a sense of future still to coe as we rebound and move on to \\"the next thing,\\" but later on, as there seem to be less and less do-overs granted one, this sort of \\"running smack into a no longer retreating horizon\\" movie starts to make a lot of painful sense (some movie-goers, of course, never allow themselves that realization, for they often go to the movies precisely to avoid it).  In interviews where actors and directors come to hawk their latest releases, I've often heard the person being interviewed suddenly do a back-up and declare, \\"I don't wanna give you the impression that this movie is a downer . . . .\\"  Well, this movie definitely is . . . a downer!  But in being so, it touches the heart with a reminder that we all come and go, and in passing we leave a \\"human stain\\" reflective of the sweep of human history-- and the writing hand moves forward, and having moved forth, it never comes back to rewrite anything again.  BE BRAVE.  LET THE STORY TOUCH YOU, IN ALL ITS MULTIPLICITY AND TIME-GONE-BY-NESS!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some if the games are fun, but there are many I don't have a clue how to do... and they don't have instructions!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This dvd is a great product worth the money specially because of its Blue Ray quality... you can never go past Harry Potter...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a very fun grouping of games that have appeal to everyonne. my friends and I all take turns playing and trying to unlock new games.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game plays and looks great!  I love being able to upgrade, but wish I could start new games from higher levels.  It can get a little tedious building back up to more challenging attacks.<br /><br />Fantastic game and shouldn't be overlooked whether free or not.
B006BQI1V2|5.0|Even though this book made me cry a few times, I LOVED it! Showed up on my computer AND my Windows phone immediately after purchase!
B000J2FD7O|5.0|I think the best way to sum this movie up would be to quote Leon Russel and Marc Benno in \\"Asylum Choir\\"....\\"we're sad little children playing grown up games...\\"
0691152640|3.0|I hate to be nit-picky, but other than a few data points, this is really mainly a 20th and 21st century book, not a sweeping economic history, which is what I was expecting. The book itself is well-researched and argued, although it has a thrown-together feel that makes it seem rushed to put together. The value of it is that it does take a more popular approach to complex economic issues, and that's badly needed in such a time of economic illiteracy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|just got it and I love it so much... kind of mad that I cant get passed some of the games....
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's a good game, but kind of repetitive. You tap to shoot at the incoming missiles and nukes, fix your buildings, upgrade your missiles, and not much else. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, it's just not really my thing. Pretty good FAotD.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|the first missle command clone that got it right and added to the concept by adding upgrades and the ability to rebuild/fix damaged buildings... awesome on my kindle fire..not so great on my droid...  good job epic pixel.
B00104W8T6|4.0|I got the CD and being as I bought it used I thought it would have some scratches on it but it was in perfect condition and I love Juno the movie and the songs in the movie!! The case was a little broken but still usable. I'm happy I purchased this for such a  good price too.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I tried several calendars for my kindle and none of them would work with my google calendar. This app works perfect on my kindle fire. I have no complains about anything.<br /><br />one issue I had was one of my reoccuring events was showing on the wrong Sunday(every other week).<br />I changed the default start of the week day from default to Monday and it fixed it.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|My first \\"hard to find\\" lego build and I have to say I am mighty impressed. The end result is a marvel to the Lego designers.<br /><br />The only negative I have is with the packaging and the difficulty of finding parts from time to time. What I mean about this is that opening the box I was<br />presented with a series of plastic bags of varying parts which fell apart with time. The only way to make sense of it all was to place all the items into separate plastic/glass containers. I remember when I got lego sets in the past and the kit came in nice and tidy compartmentalised box. Maybe with this many pieces it becomes difficult...<br /><br />That aside I had great fun building the set and am looking forward to my Tower Bridge arriving (which I purchased direct from Lego.com as it was cheaper).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this set of mini games is very entertaining. Its good for all ages. the variety of games is great. very fun.
0385344325|5.0|THIS IS A EARLIER REACHER BOOK WHEN HE IS STILL IN THE ARMY.HE'S HOOKED UP WITH A SMALL TOWN SHERIFF(WHO'S A EX-MARINE)SO HAPPENS BOTH WERE MP'S. AND THE STORY IS THE NORMAL WHO DONE IT WITH A GREAT TWIST!!! I WOULD TELL ANYONE TO READ IT!!!!
B0068FYZIO|5.0|This is a movie up and above any others of entertainment alone.  Really, how 'entertaining' is this to know at all?  Only the inspiration of one man's turning from evil to good that did and will inspire the world.  This is an outpouring of the human soul and the ultimate will to live, that everyone should see.  I think that every school child of appropriate age should see this, as it hits with a more personal accounting than with a generalized time in our history.  In the former lies it's genius.<br /><br />The story of Oskar Schindler, who saved over 1000 human lives from extinction due to the nazi party.  A study of unrelenting kindness and a study of heinous evil that transcends time, age and our history itself.  Not just for the Jewish nation, but for all nations to be able to see what befalls when tyrannical madness monopolizes.<br /><br />The most beautiful and the most ugly of movies ever made, it really cannot warrant rating.  It quite simply stands alone in movie making, and the scope of history.  One should put themselves up to annual watching at least, to always know that humans can be the most vile creation here.  And also, humanity can be it's most bespeaking for change.<br /><br />Get out your copy or purchase one, and gather your family to watch this Masterpiece again.  You mustn't miss \\"Schindler's List\\".
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Starts off easy but gets very tough. Made it to night 32 on my first go. Maybe needs a way to save or a checkpoint system as im not sure if I'll play that long again
B0054JZC6E|4.0|definitely good brain work! !!! would be nice if it had hints to help master the games. The help just describes the game and really does not help conquer Still very addicting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a cool minigame collection for free that is a good way to get in a quick play to pass the time
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun game. First free app I have actually downloaded and played in a while. Normally they are just one time downloads and then uninstall
B005XQLBU4|3.0|gets repetitive quickly, the background does not ever change. it would be a better game if each night you had a different screen. also no way to exit without using home button on kindle fire. runs very smooth on the tire, no lags or anything. very responsive controls. ok faotd
B005URRCUY|2.0|There something about the sound of this band that just wears on me.  It's like I can't listen to them for more than 10 minutes because the sound is just annoying.  It's got a great groove,  cool lyrics,  I SHOULD like it.  And I do.  There's just something about the tinny over-distorted sound that grates on me.  I even bought the Live DVD, ..at The Crystal Ballroom and...same thing.  10 minutes in and I'm like,  that's it,  enough.  Are they hiding behind the distortion?  The tin can effect on the vocals?  I don't know.  There are some good songs here,  I'd like to hear them without all the fog clouding the sound. Check out Lonely Boy,  the fuzz covering the song ruins it.  If it didn't have the fuzz,  it would take some balls to sing that song without hiding behind all the....noise.
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|I love this role-reversed tower defense genre. Having never seen it before, I am going to take the liberty of giving it a name. I shall call this type of game &quot;tower offense,&quot; as in: &quot;Anomaly Warzone Earth is a fantastic tower offense game.&quot;
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its free. Solitaire is classic fun. I use it during breaks at work or while being a passenger in a long car ride. It is just a good game to keep on hand.
0061928356|5.0|This was such a good book  that I read I wanted to give a copy to my best friend. She enjoyed it too.  Best always, Sandra
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is the best Bible App I've ever used. It's easy to navigate and quickly find passages during Sunday School and sermons.
B002ZG97LK|1.0|a repeat of the same movie you saw in the 80's, only the original had better actors, better soundtrack and had more heart. this is just trying to make money off the name, almost scene by scene like the original, same dialogue with some added new things here and there to make it more modern. this movie has no soul. avoid it and watch the original.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the controls are cumbersome and a few games a simplistic compared to standalone equivalents. However overall it's a good diversion and quick to play.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good for something that is free like most games but some games are just plain weird to like that fly game
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I've gone on the Nyko site and tried every single solution but depending on the game and time of day, the Nyko makes the Kinect more buggy than the 1 ft recovered in my play space is worth. Pretty disappointing...
B0034G4OR2|5.0|My favorite Twilight Zone TV episode is \\"Night of the Meek\\" starring Art Carney, airing back around 1960.  All these 50 some odd years later I have never forgotten the down and out loser who wanted nothing for himself except the ability to give Christmas presents to others.  This is the premise of Arthur Christmas.  It is a wonderfully gentle and moving family Christmas movie.  Hollywood is seldom capable of producing such fine family entertainment.  I'm not at all surprised that the film was produced, directed and written by Europeans.  This is a film that is truly for all ages and all countries.  It should become a classic.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is a great game challenging. ! !  !! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!
0152023984|4.0|Little Prince is a classic well worth reading! A mature book that can be enjoyed by any age. Understanding and caring of others.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I never considered myself a reader, especially a 500 PAGE \\"thriller mystery\\". Since I was given my kindle reading has become my new sport. \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest\\" was the third book I read and I couldn't put my kindle down!!! I read it in record time!  It is a remarkable book! Exciting! Thrilling!! Intense!! All the things in a book I thought I wouldn't like, but was GLUED to! Oh, and there was pleanty of romance! It was impossible for me to predict what was going to happen around the corner, event though I thought I had! In the end of course, thank God, good I(kind of) prevails.... and I was exhausted but loved reading this final book of 3. I have to read the other 2 before I see the movies and can't wait for this movie to be released! Two thumbs up!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is hands down one of the best games on my kindle fire. Download and you will not be disappointed!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awesome app on the kindle fire. hated the old ball thing. I will keep this one installed which is a good thing.
B004H1YH66|5.0|This is, without a doubt, film music to make the original masters proud. Basil Poledouris--then a relative unknown-- pays tribute to them all in this operatic, pounding, complex, haunting epic masterwork. The bouncy string-and-brass intro to \\"Infidels\\" recalls Franz Waxman's \\"Taras Bulba\\"; the elegant processional in \\"The Mountain of Power\\" recalls Dimitri Tiomkin's \\"Fall of the Roman Empire\\" as well as many of Miklos Rozsa's Roman scores; and \\"Riders of Doom,\\" most frequently compared to \\"O Fortuna,\\" is almost like Jerry Goldsmith's \\"The Omen\\" had a very dramatic baby with John Barry's \\"The Lion in Winter.\\" And for the first time, the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra gives an altogether stunning performance. The sound is slightly different than in the original film for a number of reasons, primarily because the original film recordings had a smaller orchestra with fewer unique instruments. The real anvil Poledouris originally intended to use in \\"The Anvil of Crom\\" (in my opinion, the greatest piece of opening-credit music in film history) is finally used here, and the orchestra displays a precision and togetherness that is almost completely absent from their recordings of, for example, \\"El Cid\\" and \\"Spartacus.\\" It often sounds better, clearer, and less pitchy than the still-superb soundtrack recordings. This astounding set also includes several bonus cues (there's a recording of \\"Theology/Civilization\\" played in a slower tempo, although it sounds better fast) and all the source music. The sequence takes one brief, minor liberty with the order of the cues (combining the two tavern pieces to make them flow better with subsequent cues). And yes, folks, I am usually a purist in my belief that the original soundtrack is better than any re-recording. But I'm happy to confirm there are exceptions to every rule. Look, also, for a complete recording of \\"Conan the Destroyer.\\"
B0068RGVMK|5.0|\\"Imaginaerum\\" by Nightwish  is a very captivating cd with emotionally and spiritually charged lyrics of the Goth metal music genre.  One of the underlying themes weaved in this cd appears to be that of carving more meaning out of life.  For me, two of my favorite songs that embody that are \\"Rest and Calm\\" and \\"Turn LooseThe Mermaids.\\"  \\"Rest and Calm\\" seems to have a dramatic and positive message of rebirth and starting over new in life.  \\"Turn Loose The Mermaids\\" contains lyrics of forging journeys in life.  \\"Imaginaerum\\"  by Nightwish is best for the many who enjoy soul nourishing music.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|it it a very good repro of a classic game s it is fairly true to the spirit of it too
0800141806|5.0|I never know if they arrived on time. They arrive, I watch them. Shrug? This item was as advertised and in the correct aspect ratio. OAR is the most important thing for me when ordering old movies. If you want good service - goHastings!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is an awesome game, very challenging, and looks incredible on the kindle fire. Download and you will love it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this game.  Totally addicting! Easy to play.  But why would anyone want a random deal instead of a winning deal?
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This DVD arrived quickly and was as described. I ordered two copies. One for myself and one for a Christmas gift to a friend.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|The dvd of Beyonce: Live At Roseland Elements of 4 shows a concert full of engaging performances.  In addition both dvds have bonus performances.  Beyonce projects forth intense energy for the selected musical tracks.  She starts the event out with cleverly weaving the origins of her musical career into the various songs. My two favorite parts of this concert were tied into the renditions of \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"Love On Top\\".  The scene that also pulled at my heartstrings was where she was shown hugging a young fan during \\"Irreplaceable\\".  He is one of her biggest fans and appeared to be younger than 13.  Things became even more sentimental and touching when Beyonce gently suggested that he sing \\"Irreplaceable\\".  I have to say that this scene made me like her even more because it was obvious that he (the young fan) felt uplifted by her encouragement. What also makes the purchase worth it is that the second dvd contains six great music videos.  It is a tie between the music videos that I enjoyed the most: \\"Love On Top\\" and \\"Dance For You.\\"  Beyonce: Live At Roseland: Elements of 4 is best for anyone that enjoyed any of her music videos and/or songs from the \\"4\\" collection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to pass some extra time. I hope that my review helps.
B002VKE0U8|5.0|I never know if they arrived on time. They arrive, I watch them. Shrug? This item was as advertised and in the correct aspect ratio. OAR is the most important thing for me when ordering old movies. If you want good service - goHastings!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is challenging as hell, and as good as hell. The graphics are good. You wont be unhappy with this game.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|As the title said, this album is just fantastic.  Every single song is a clear five-star.  My only dissapointance is that Billie Jean is not included.  I'm a straight guy, and the more I listen to this album, the more I'm falling in love with Chris ... it's that good! haha.  More seriously, I really hope Cornell is planning to quickly do another unplugged album with some of his songs and more covers.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|You gotta love angry birds! Seasons is pretty fun and has this years and last years version. It was the first thing i downloaded on my kindle
B005TQAI6G|5.0|\\"Britney Spears Live: The Femme Fatale Tour\\" is a strong concert dvd that showcases the musical hits from the \\"Circus\\" and \\"The Femme Fatale\\" cd collections. I attended one of her fun concerts over five months ago, and was curious to see how this concert dvd would compare.  She gave a great live performance, and watching this version exceeded my expectations of what I had set.  The following are some of the various interesting moments of this dvd:<br /><br />If U Seek Amy: The dancers were cleverly simulating the paparrazi.  Britney Spears was wearing a Marilyn Monroesque skirt during the performance.<br /><br />Gimme More: There was a unique Egyptian theme and she was wearing gold to keep with the theme (a golden two-piece).<br /><br />Drop Dead Gorgeous: The dancers are seen positioning themselves in gold frames, and singer Sabi makes a guest appearance.  Sabi is also known for appearing with Cobra Starship in their music video of \\"You Make Me Feel\\" (including lending her vocals to \\"You Make Me Feel\\")<br /><br />I Wanna Go: There is a good group sequence of the dancers carefully timing their moves with Britney Spears.<br /><br />Nicki Minaj appears towards the end of the concert.<br /><br />There is also a remixed cd with this edition, but I admit to liking the concert dvd portion more.  However, I only wish that at least one to two bonuses were included.  \\"Britney Spears Live: The Femme Fatale Tour\\" is recommended for anyone who enjoys her songs from the\\" Femme Fatale collection\\" and/or liked any live concerts from the \\"Femme Fatale\\" tour.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Best Bible app that I have found. It's crashed a couple of times on my Fire but works perfectly on my Aneroid.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This app is very detailed every little thing like colors to even stickers are very well design &amp; put together.i highly recommend it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|long haul play, but it entertains you. can get quite addictive the first time but that wears off eventually. not bad,at the end of the day
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game play works extremely well. I'm using it on my sony tablet and all featuress are extremely clean and crisp. The only downfall is the ads that take place before each game but what can you expect for free. I just skip out of the ads and enjoy the game.
B005HSL626|5.0|Kept me entertained on my kindle all say. I love it and its fun and just a mindless game. I like it on the kindle better because its bigger
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is very similar to the old original Atari game. The upgrade system makes the game less frustrating and more fun...at least at first. Around night 15, you'll start having trouble keeping up with the upgrades since the pace gets extremely frantic. Even though the game gets rough, it's a whole lot of fun. It's definitely worth buying even if you don't get it free.
B004EPZ0BQ|5.0|I watched this the other night and found it fun! Really cute movie and it had a lot of laughs.  Probably one I can watch over and over.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Most of the little games are fun, but a few are dumb. The difficulty level varies greatly between games. Other than that I really enjoy this game!
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I absolutely loved her first CD and this is even better. Florence+the Machine captures some of the largest emotional highs and lows and so much in between.
B001B6PBBK|2.0|The movie was pretty dull and predictable.  It seemed to take a long time to set up the plot and then rushed through it.  There were some cute parts, it wasn't awful for free, but I don't think it is worth the 90 minutes of your time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This has to be one of the best missile defense games on android. I really like the upgrade and repair concept. Well done.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Graphics are lame and the sounds are rediculously bad, however the game is great. With each level you gain points to buy upgrades, useful upgrades. And the game gets increasingly tense at the right rate. One of the best missle defenders i have ever played.
B0036T32LQ|2.0|Not impressed, slow moving and not a plot I was happy to watch. Expected something more exciting, but fell far short in my opinion.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Great present for anyone that loves Doctor Who and/or David Tennant. While the quality of the toy is somewhat low, it's still a good value for the price and a lot of fun. The UV pen makes for lots of fun \\"secret\\" messages and mayhem. The light is quite cool, a bit more indigo than blue, and deceptively bright. It won't replace your flashlight/torch, but it certainly isn't something you'd feel comfortable staring into for long.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with it. It isn't incredibly well made, but it does do justice to the prop it is meant to represent. The demo batteries that come with it are not likely to last too long, but that's to be expected. Lots of fun!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This Kindle Fire Cover by Marware is a nice addition to protect the product and very lightweight.  It allows my wife to carry the Kindle Fire in her purse all the time.  I would reccomment this cover and Amazon for all your needs.

B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a perfect spider solitaire game. It has everything a spider solitarist could ever want from a game. I recommend this app highly.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Great cast, poor movie.  Extremely slow paced.  I have not read the books but might after reading other reviews.  I can imagine that this dud of a movie might have begun its life as a good book...But seriously, this movie has nothing to recommend it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Plays pretty smoothly on my Nexus Prime.  Not a ton of variability but the upgrade system helps spice things up.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I purchased 'Warrior' recently, I enjoyed the movie immensely.  Its a fight movie with drama about a broken family, the main cast are outstanding, I can't recommend this movie enough.  If you haven't watched it, please do so.
0545265355|4.0|I dont want to repeat what everyone else is saying... But i will say that the books were great... I borrowed them originally from a friend and after finishing them, i just had to buy them for myself... This trilogy set looks great on my shelf, so much so that im about to read them all over again just because hah
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game, smooth gameplay, nice looking graphics. The upgrades and difficulty progession are perfect. It could use a little variety, bombers, aliens, maybe a boss of some sort, but that's just an idea, still a good game as it is.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|The game delivers mindless fun.  Recommended for anyone who liked the old missile command.  Like me!  The power ups actually make it somewhat better than the original.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games r wack but i like a few of the. air hockey is a fav of mine
B006JPS1OM|5.0|loved this game.  I love hogs and match 3 games.  i really loved this one! great stress relieved. the story was great.

B005K17RU0|3.0|this app may not be the end all - be all of weather apps but it does what it is supposed to do for me. it has some room for improvement, so I'm sure the developers are hard at work tweeking and coding to make this app even better!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|only way to make hake better would be make upgrades cheapern becauw after a while need it all but have no way to buy cause all money spent rebuilding ciy
B005XQLBU4|5.0|First game I got an increased heart rate from... Wow! Very good game. You should get this one today. very much a good spin on a classic game.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I really like this keyboard, but I uninstalled for several reasons: (a) space bar is tiny and I would constantly get words likebthis that would not be corrected, (b) auto saves every typo I make, including the example above, (c) no swype-type input option, (d) you have to long press for the voice key, which frequently pops up the swiftkey settings menu anyway. Drives me nuts! Fix these issues and I'll reinstall.<br /><br />Update 9/13/2012<br /><br />All of the changes made to Swiftkey 3 are fantastic, so I am moving my rating up to 4 stars. No more issues likebthis and the voice key is far more accessible. Still waiting for Swype!
B000JQU4TW|5.0|I read quite a lot and I have not been so entranced by a book in a very long time. I finished it in one day, because I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book, and all other Oscar Wilde works for that matter.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I downloaded based on other comments. would have paid for this app. plays very smoothly on my motorola xoom. my citizens have about two weeks before they should desert my city :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best games in the world and there all good and there 101 i love it so so so so much
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I was just looking for an app to store notes, but Evernotes is exceeding my expectations. Being able to save notes and retrieve them on any system has been useful.
B006TLFIAQ|2.0|Sometimes a movie will have all the right ingredients but somehow the finished product doesn't add up.  For me. this is what happened with this movie.  I love a good mindless action flick and this one had many good actors. I feel the director played a part in what was lacking.  For one, the character development was poor.  We WANT to like these guys but there wasn't alot to latch onto; Statham was Statham, DeNiro's character was one dimensional (kept waiting for more and it never came), Owen's character had no likability at all, etc, etc..  The one on one fight scenes were SO annoying, worse than the wiggly camera trend.  You could barely see what was going on. It was also hard to keep up with what was going on with the plot, there didn't seem to be alot of emphasis on making sure the viewer understood what was happening.   At the end of this film, all I could think of was what was wrong with it. I won't be giving this director a 2nd chance.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This 57year-old dudette should be working on her thesis but can't stop playing this great rendition of my favorite game from the 70's - or was it the 80's? Use a stylus for humongous scores! Excellent, thanks!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i love angry birds its fun to play and im literally always playing it. i would recommend this game to any and everyone.from all ages!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games make you want to keep playing and earn more and more. There are some games that I rember from my childhood. SO MUCH FUN!!!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is a great game. it has fluid graphics and gameplay.<br />well done.  rush out and get this game.<br /> you wont be disappointed.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|First game I flew around blowing everything up and everyone hated me.  Second time through I decided to figure out what I was doing and had a blast.  The unlock achievements are fun as well. Best game I have on my Fire and has been updated regularly. Spending the couple dollars on Elite is well worth it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Just like the old days although easier than the arcade version it seems to work very well requires accurate tapping which on nexus one is hard
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app and all its features very helpful to a growing Christian I especially like the reading plans and that the versions can be adjusted
B005LAIGH8|5.0|Review of the film(not DVD) - EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE  THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS - I literally knew nothing about the movie except that the fictional storyline concerned a boy dealing with his father's death during the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers. A friend of mine received passes to an early showing in NYC, and she invited me to attend a few hours before the screening. Since I particularly enjoy the acting of Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks, I immediately accepted.  The timing  was fortunate because I had no preconceptions and had no time to research any  details; thus, the story unfolded as a complete surprise - rather than with the foreknowledge which many reviews and plot descriptions on most of the movie sites provide. (E.g. the NEW YORKER article/review which I subsequently read basically reveals te whole story so that te author can criticize it.)  I would highly recommend that you see the movie without immersing yourself beforehand in the plot details. Thus, I have intentionally chosen not to discuss them in this review. (One of my pet peeves is reviews of both books and films which provide spoilers.)   N.B. I am not a fan of the writing of Jonathan Safran Foer and so cannot compare this movie's script with his book on which it is based.  The star of both the story and the film is Oskar Schell, an 11 year old boy who is played by Thomas Horn. We meet Oskar and his father (who is also his mentor and best friend) Thomas (Tom Hanks) enjoying some time together in Central Park, Soon after that, the lives of Oskar and his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) life are tragically altered and their relationship incredibly stressed by the 9/11 tragedy. The remainder of the story then revolves about Oskar's journey , emotional and physical throughout NYC, as he attempts to cope with the aftermath of his father's death and his actions during and reaction to the events of that day (which are very tensely revealed in several flashbacks). We meet many individuals who play a role in Oskar's attempt to unravel the mysteries left behind by his father. Among these are his grandmother (Thomas's mother) , played by Zoe Caldwell, who lives across thee street and who Oskar can observe and signal from his bedroom window. In addition, his grandmother's taciturn and mysterious boarder (wonderfuly acted by  Max von Sydow), plays a crucial role in Oskar's travels and the eventual personal transformation that occurs.  My perspective on and reactions to the film are deeply influenced  by the fact that I work and live part time in NYC. (My office in fact had a wonderful view of the Twin Towers and their sudden absence and the alteration of the horizon for years was a constant reminder of the tragedy.)  I attended meetings in the WTC numerous time, and  had several good friends who were murdered by the terrorists that day. Thus, recollections of those attacks and their aftermath still evoke strong emotions for me, although my own  emotional journey was obviously much less intense and directly personal than Oskar's.  This movie will understandably and inevitably evoke varied responses given the power emotional impact of that day and the lens which each individual will view the film. For me, however, while far from perfect for a variety of mostly minor reasons, it was immensely engaging, very well acted and directed, and in its totality and conclusion tremendously life affirming (rather than sad, tragic, or disturbing).  As I stated, I found a few brief segments very tense and psychologically powerful; however, the tension was frequently lightened by intermittent humorous segments, many involving the diverse individuals who Oskar encountered during his journey.  I want to both emphasize and assure (or warn or disappoint as the case may be) potential  moviegoers  that it is in no way either a political statement or factual examination of the event! Rather it is a fictional account of its impact on an 11 year old boy and those with whom he comes in contact during his attempts to cope with his father's death, whose impact was totally unexpected and devastating.  So, if you want to see an EXTREMELY INTENSE BUT INCREDIBLY ENJOYABLE film about the resiliency of the human spirit when faced with overwhelming tragedy, I strongly recommend EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE. It is approximately two hours long, and I felt that it was time well spent. It is a serious story about youth, sorrow and joy, the attempt to extract meaning from adversity, personal relationships, and the role of humor is helping us cope and adapt. And I emphasize again, I found its conclusion as life affirming as did Oskar and his family and the friends who he made. Just remember that it is fiction in the service of a search for truths concerning our existence, and neither an historical examination  of the events of 9/11 or simply light entertainment.  HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED - with a slight deduction from a full five star rating for a few loose ends that could have easily been tied up and for one relatively unbelievable revelation very late in the film.  Tucker Andersen 1/15/2012
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The title says it all.  This app has plenty of games with different objectives and controls.  I am very glad I downloaded this app.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|This one was straight to DVD, despite the big name cast, and I can sort of see why. Moments of the acting are a bit amateurish, even including most of the otherwise great John Goodman's take on a New Orleans mobster. Tommy Lee Jones, as the alcoholic sheriff, has played that role at least a dozen times, and he gets it pretty right. The weird dream scenes with Levon Helm as the Confederate general should have been left on the cutting room floor. Not that Helm is bad. He looks the part. It's just that we don't need that interrupting the flow. We also don't need the voiceovers by the sheriff. I guess this was based on a novel series I haven't read. It does smack a bit of an Elmore Leonard movie, most of which don't work very well either. This is not bad, but it's far from great.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|Hanna is a beautifully haunting and powerful film. If you've not seen it, then do, because it is different than what you may have decided from the previews. This movie is about loss and love and shows us that no matter what happens to us, we can retain our innocence and that the family we create through the friends we make are really the ones that matter. See this film.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i love this app! it is very well put together. if you click the radar button you can pause at the frame that you are wanting to study. this really helps with tracking a storm.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|a fun game with lots of challenging levels and stages. makes you think a lot and gives unlimited times to.beat each level
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|simply put...<br />Jessica Lange in her first ever television series<br />= Award Winning Brilliance!<br />it's Must see- and Unique- as only FX network can do.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Wow!  \\"Paul\\" was a sleeper film, which sadly I missed in the Theatres, but I have to say that I haven't laughed this hard since Hot Fuzz! The British comic team of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have done it again, perhaps better than ever before. While this movie is a loving homage to Science Fiction and it's Fandom the story and humor can easily be enjoyed by all mature audiences (I own and have only seen the unrated version - the Brits do not have hangups about swearing like many Americans do) much in the same way as \\"Galaxy Quest\\" can be.  The brilliant blending of the homey down to earth Travel Beagle replete with coffee stains and mud on the carpet and 70's era apolostery juxtaposed next to \\"Paul\\" himself who appears as a  real alien, rather than a CG drop in, is heartwarming and funny - It's a buddy travel adventure, perhaps one of the best ever made! I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a good story and a laugh and for we Sci-Fi fans it's like coming home.  Don't miss it!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so much fun. I definitely reccomend.it I love it so much. its something fun.to play when you're bored
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Game is fun to play. Lots of variety. It does have lots of adds, but I guess I could buy it. Passes the day very nicely.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|recently watched this filmed again- it has likely been at least 25 years since the last viewing (I was young then, not so young now).<br /><br />What I really like was the \\"tone\\" of the film.  What I mean is the emotional depth that the audience has in connecting with the characters.  For that, credit goes to director Richard Donner.  The film is mostly a drama, with light comedic touches.  It has a real nostalgic feel to it.<br /><br />brief plot:  Superman loses his parents in a far distant apocolyptic world, more advanced than Earth.  Thanks to a recording device imbedded in his satellite, Superman learns about his origin and his future purpose.  Once on Earth as he grows physically, he faces alienation as he tries to cope with \\"fitting in\\" with his peers- all the while harboring the secrets of his super powers.<br /><br />By becoming his super alter-ego, he can use his powers for good, and feel validated in ways that his Clark Kent persona cannot.  Thus, psychologically, Superman provides Clark Kent with ego balance, making him a whole and complete person.<br /><br />One of the best aspects of the film is the casting.  We've got Marlon Brando (Oscar winner), Gene Hackman (Oscar winner), then new-comer Christopher Reeve, and Margot Kidder as the main players.  The casting was just perfect.  I can't imagine Superman being anyone else than Chris Reeve.  I can't imagine Lex Luthor being anyone else than Gene Hackman, and I can't imagine Lois Lane being anyone else than Margot Kidder.<br /><br />The other great piece of the film is the script.  Intelligent, inspiring, touching, adventurous, and most of all, believable.  Everyone has some \\"good lines\\" in this film, memorable lines, which to me is a sign of a good script.<br /><br />*highly recommended*

B006GG1KOC|2.0|I like it and I done I thought it would be more fun to play on my kindle fire . that is it bibi
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical about this book before I knew what it was about. I started reading it, slowly, not really into it. But then I understood the storyline and I was hooked. It's such an original story and well written too! The characters, Katniss, Gale, Peeta, Prim, and others are well formed and have orginality. While this book is sad, and a little depressing, such as getting to know little Rue but knowing her fate, it is still truly amazing. With twists, adventure, action, suspense, and romance, you really got to pat Suzanne Collins on the back. She's an AMAZING author and I can't wait to read her future stories outside of The Hunger Games trilogy. If you have no intent on reading this book, rethink and give it a try! I guarantee you WON'T regret it!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun to play. good graphic and sound. well with the download. I like extra a you can buy between each round

B002YE452Y|5.0|Wow, This is a must own set for Shakira fans, Even though I already had most of the songs.  It was great to get this collection along with the truly amazing video dvd super quality entertaining and rare interesting interviews as well.  Every time I see something new with Shakira it leaves me wanting more, the true sign of a genuine entertainer.  This cd dvd set is my favorite item from her works so far, and I highly recommend it for all fans!!!   William Brooks - Toronto, Canada

0812550706|5.0|This is arguably one of the best sci-fi books ever written, what lord of the rings did for fantasy, enders game emulates it for the science fiction genre. This book is masterfully written and should be required reading for anyone that is a fan of the genre.
0393976041|5.0|Tried to read this a few years ago and just could not get into it.  I should have tried harder.  My daughter had me watch the movie.<br />I loved it!  So I saw the ebook free version and decided to make another attempt.  Yes, it is written for a more elegant time, yes it is not a easy read, if one is not accustomed to reading old classics.  But so worth the effort.  I had to be in a room with no distractions.<br />I love it. I rarely give 5 stars to anything.  This one hits the mark.

0439023521|4.0|This review is for the entire series. Great characters, hero's in the truest sense.  Dark twists and deception.  Leaves you a little uneasy. Great ending to the last book (I like happy endings, yes I'm a warm and fuzzy kind of girl even in science fiction/fantasy books)( This one is conflicted 2 great guys, only one could get the girl).  Sit on the end of your seat.  Compelling- can't put it down kind of book.

1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs's intuition led him to clearly see solutions to problems that were beyond his control.  At Apple he could restructure and fire if necessary in order to solve critical problem and thus create fantastic products.  On bigger problems like the terrible economy he could only be brutally honest to his biographer and try to help indirectly.  For example, he was disappointed in his friend Obama.  In Jobs's opinion the President lacked leadership.  Jobs tried to instruct Obama on how \\"...to be a lot more business-friendly\\" and thus get the economy moving and create jobs.  Obama in a typically \\"clever\\" way in effect ignored that advice.  And since Jobs could not fire him that was the end of it. A potential life-line thrown to the economy by an intuitive genius went to waste. Also Jobs's brutal honesty caused him to leave behind valuable advice even to a competitor of Apple.  Jobs clearly saw that the lack of creativity at Microsoft was due to Ballmer being at the helm for so long (as I write Ballmer is still there and Microsoft stock continues to languish as it has for years).

0060245867|4.0|My daughter isn't reading, but she loves being read to and pictures are important in the books we read. She really likes the pictures in this book, they're engaging and colorful and there's so many things to point out white we are reading. I had the opportunity to meet Ms. Numeroff in my line of work, and was able to hear her read her books out loud. She really adds something to it when she reads them, and I try to incorporate that in my reading.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this game!  it is different because it has strategy to it because you have to decide when to upgrade your Missles  and whether or not to rebuild your towers.  I love it!
B003DZX44I|5.0|Do not mistake this film for a movie just for children. Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's best animated films and the first animated films ever to be nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture.Everything in Beauty and the Beast is extraordinary, such as the music. The music is not only entertaining, but it informs people about the characters in the story. The time it would take to explain a character's persona, such as Belle or Gaston, is condensed into a three or four minute song. Also, this re-release is great. The colors are more vivid either on blu-ray or DVD.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|The movie itself is very entertaining and the animation and 3D are breath taking. Highly recommend. Good price for the combo pack.

B006OV7S1I|5.0|Martha Marcy May Marlene marks the debut of two talents, the director, Sean Durkin, and the actress, Elizabeth Olsen. Both actor and director show a kind of assured performance that seems relegated to those who are either new to a scene, when talent has been building up for some time and only now has had a chance to unveil itself, or to older creative types, who have enough success behind them that they no longer fear failure (the in-between is usually the tricky part). Elizabeth Olsen (and here I'm required to tell you that she is the younger sister to the famed Full House Olsen twins) plays Martha, a girl who has spent an indeterminate amount of time in a cult hidden away in upstate New York. She eventually flees the confines of the commune and is taken in by her sister and brother-in-law who own a spacious lake house in Connecticut.  From here the film is divided into two narratives, one chronicling Martha's ordeal in the Manson-like collective and the other detailing her return to polite society at her sister's place. We learn from the former narrative that the cult takes in runaways and is overseen by a charismatic leader, Patrick, played by John Hawkes. While the cult members bandy about pseudo-New Wave jargon, we hear talk of energies, the specific philosophy of the cult remains vague. As one might expect, Patrick has intimate access to most of the women, as do the other men on the compound, to varying degrees. The cult members share duties taking care of children and tending to a garden, and they hope one day to go fully off the grid.  The second narrative follows Martha as she attempts to reconnect with her sister Lucy and return to normalcy. For Martha, the lake house is an even more foreign world than the cult. She still plays by the rules set up for her by Patrick. She goes skinny dipping in the middle of the day. And when she feels lonely in her bedroom, she has no qualms about lying down on the foot of Lucy's bed, even if her sister is in mid-coitus. As Martha's actions become increasingly bizarre, her brother-in-law puts more pressure on Lucy to hand her sister over to an institution. As we learn what Martha has gone through, it becomes more and more difficult to sympathize with Lucy and her husband's frustrations. But while Lucy's husband, Ted, often comes off as a prick (tellingly, he has a well enunciated British accent), it is hard to blame Lucy's reticence to take on the responsibility of handling Martha on her own.  Even though the two narratives are chronologically back to back--the story of Martha's time in the cult followed by her time with her sister--neither is prized over the other. In fact, it is difficult for me to describe events that occur at the compound as flashbacks because for Martha these events do not exist in the past. She carries the trauma with her. Durkin, the director, excises most establishing shots from the movie, making it difficult to tell whether the next scene begins at the lake house or the compound. The title of the film is a series of names the main character goes by. Her birth name is obviously Martha. She is given the name Marcy May by Patrick when she joins the cult. And Marlene is a communal name used by all the women in the cult to answer the phone. Martha is a woman who has been stripped of her ego and exists in the liminal space between \\"is\\" and \\"was.\\"  Elizabeth Olsen does a fantastic job of portraying a woman who has undergone immense pain. While this trauma does not always manifest itself, it always lingers underneath the surface of her performance. Likewise, Durkin imbues even the most mundane scenes with a sense of tension. It is far, far too early to tell where either Olsen or Durkin's career will go at this point, but I would be interested in seeing the two work together again. Regardless, I have a feeling plenty more will come from both of these talents.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|I'm playing on the kindle fire and I thought it looked pretty cool but then it got repetitive. Its very frustrating and the graphics look pretty cool and it runs smoothly.

0446556750|4.0|In the Reversal, Defense Attorney Mickey Haller is convinced to take on a role as an independent special prosecutor in a retrial. The case revolves around convicted child killer, Jason Jessup, who was recently released based upon DNA evidence. Haller is joined in this case by his half-brother LAPD Detective Harry Bosch and Haller's ex-wife, Deputy DA Maggie McPherson. In the second trial, Harry will be the investigator and Maggie will be Mickey's second chair at the trial.  Jessup has spent 24 years incarcerated for the abduction and murder of 12 year old Melissa Landy. The physical evidence in the old trial is not enough to re-convict Jessup. However, Melissa Landy's older sister, Sarah, was in the yard with Melissa when she was abducted and is the prosecution's chief witness. The problem is that Sarah, while suffering from PTSD, became involved with drugs and prostitution. The defense lawyer, \\"Clever Clive\\" Royce is hoping to discredit Sarah on the stand, thereby having the original verdict of guilty thrown out and leaving Jessup a free man.   Jessup grandstands for the press by day, but by night his actions leave Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller fearing that Melissa was not Jessup's first victim. An FBI profiler confirms their fears.  This is a tightly written legal procedural. It is obvious that Connelly researched trail law and the rules of evidence extensively. The ending came on a bit fast, however, and some issues were never resolved. Well worth a read, but not Connelly's best.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not my favorite app. but it is fun enough to pass the time. leveling takes longer as you progress, which is mildly irritating.

B005EWDA9M|4.0|1Q84 is a long story, but I never felt the storyline was coming to a halt or becoming boring. The plot flows naturally, and every little part of the story carries meaning. Some people have said that too many questions are left unanswered, but I wouldn't agree with that. Rather, leaving some open ends might be a conscious strategy to leave a certain impression on the reader. The world of 1Q84 cannot be fully understood - but maybe that's a quality inherent to the fantastical world that 1Q84 is.  Murakami creates a rich world with detailed characters. Sometimes I felt the characters were a little too smart or too good at what they were doing, but that doesn't impact the work negatively. This story is not intended to be realistic, even though many elements of it certainly are real. At times I wondered if it was really necessary to describe the darker parts of the story so completely, almost ruthlessly. A decent amount of research must have been made in order to make this work come alive. Parts of this research, I guess, might not have been pleasant to carry out.  1Q84 is abundant with references to classical literature and music - maybe too much so. If you like learning about that kind of thing, however, it's a good thing. It may sound exaggerated, but I do think I learnt a lot from reading this work. It explores a variety of themes, and although the answers are rarely clear it helps one to gain a better perspective on many issues. As surrealistic as 1Q84 is, it treats real issues at length. Be it loneliness, revenge or belief.  As a reader, I haven't read much fiction lately, and that probably affects how I relate this work to other works.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I am not a big game player and decided to give this app a try while it was being offered for free. As already mentioned this takes the old arcade game and brings it to a new level.

140131046X|5.0|This is a heartwarming story of two different men leading lives of faith.  The author interviews a Jewish Rabbi who has asked him to write his eulogy. The other man is a cokehead-turned-evangelical founder of a Christian homeless shelter/food pantry. While interacting with these men the author finds his own faith and learns that most religions parallel each other. It is an easy, fast read until about the last 30 pages.  It is hard to read through tears.

B0053TMP24|5.0|I already loved Rick Riordan, but after reading this latest book in the Heroes of Olympus series, it is clear to me that Riordan has outdone himself again.  This is a spoiler free review, so I won't go into details of the books.  Let me say this though: this new cast of characters, and some old ones too, is absolutely brilliant!  My new favorite character in these books is now Hazel Levesque.  She is smart, seriously brave, a great friend (makes me wish she were mine!), and a terrible enemy to have.  Gaea, beware, because with Hazel on Percy's side, there is no way she can win.  Riordan introduces some other great characters.  Frank is really sweet.  Ok, so I will have ONE spoiler, and after it, no more, I promise:  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  ******SPOILER******  It took me reading the book two times to figure out that Leo is Sammy's great-grandson, or something.  It will be interesting to see who Hazel chooses.  Me, personally, I would choose Leo, because there is nothing better than a guy who can make you laugh.  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  ******END SPOILER******  Son of Neptune is a great book.  If you haven't read it, do.  Now that I have read it and Throne of Fire, I don't know what to do with myself until the next books in the series come out!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|We truly like our movie. It arrived on time, and was in excellent condition. We would definetly deal with this again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had read many negative reviews of this book before I started reading it. I was so very pleasantly pleased with this final installment. I hate that the series is over, but feel that the author did a great job finishing out the story line. I agree with some of the other reviewers who think maybe some of the readers were looking for a story book ending. I enjoyed reading a book that didn't give away the plot in the first chapter or two and kept me hanging on to see what would happen next to Katniss! A wonderful series that I am sure I will read again!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|You should totally buy this app. it is so fun but you'll never really finish it.  there is so many fun games.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|******SPOILER ZONE*******<br /><br />First off, to all those who said that Collins just created expendable characters: I disagree.  Every character in this book made it what it is: a masterpiece.  I could list all the characters, and tell you why I think they were important to the book, but the list would go on and on.  I'll just name a few of my favorties.<br /><br />Finnick- Ok, so when I first read about Finnick, in Catching Fire, I thought \\"Oh, great, last thing this book needs is some conceited sex symbol, but Finnick O'dair is much more than that.  He actually turned out to be one of my favorite characters.  Who else could have helped Katniss through those early days in 13?  Who else could have understood the terror she faced and, instead of just telling her she was safe, could have given her something much more important: her sanity back.  I agree, Finnick's end was terrible, but when I read the line about his and Annie's child, I cried.  I bawled my eyes out.  I can't tell you whether they were tears of grief or happiness.  Probably a mixture of both.  Without Finnick, I think that Katniss would not have been able to get through those hours during Peeta's rescue.<br /><br />Boggs- I loved Boggs.  He was one of Katniss first allies and friends from 13.  Without Boggs, Katniss would be dead ten times over.  When he got blown up, I stopped reading and couldn't continue for a few days.  Boggs made it possible for Katniss to go on her mission to Kill Snow.<br /><br />Prim- She was the one who, in my opinion, kept Katniss on the righteous path.  Their exchange when everyone is sleeping, when Katniss decides to become the Mockingjay, makes me think that Prim is Kantiss tie to the world where morals guide people.<br /><br />Everyone is complaining about how too many people die.  To them, I say this: It is war.  What do you expect?  In the last few Harry Potter books, a lot of people die, but I didn't see everyone say that the book was too sad or too unrealistic.  Some people wrote in their reviews that Collins didn't resolve anything by the end, but she DID.  Someone said that we never find out what happens to Madge, or Effie Trinket.  That's NOT TRUE. The only reason I can think of that they wrote that was they weren't paying attention.  Or, maybe, they didn't even read the end.  Although it doesn't go into detail of what happens to Effie, she does make an appearance in the end.  Madge, unfortunately, is one of the many who dies in the fire-bombing of 12.  I like the ending.  Not all the people dying, but when Peeta and Katniss finally sleep together, then he says \\"You love me.  Real or not real?\\" and she says \\"Real.\\"  I also like the book they write together.  Writing is one of the only things that help me with MY PTSD.  I cried so much during the book, the smiles at the end meant all the more.  Their children.  When Katniss tells us about their children, I was grinning ear to ear.  All in all, it was a great book.  Only one word of advice: read it in the privacy of your own home.  Because there is nothing more embarrassing than weeping at the public library.'t resolve anything by the end, but she DID.

0446585025|3.0|I really like Ellen:  her show, stand-up comedy and her other books.  So it bothers me to have to say that this was really not her best work.  I was very excited to read this book and looked forward to her unique humor.  However, it was really lacking in this book.  I felt like she didn't have a clear vision of what she wanted the book to be so it ended up being a cumbersome mix of biography, preachy life advice and comedy.  I was also disapointed that the comedy didn't feel fresh.  I own all of her stand-up specials, and noticed many of the bits crop up throughout the book.  This felt like a rushed book that never found it's stride.  If you are an Ellen fan, I would skip this book and look forward to her next.

B005MW8CUG|4.0|I imagine I'm only preaching to the converted, but I'll still state the obvious.  This is an amazing record, quite possibly the pumpkins best.  It also holds up much better than many of its early nineties peers.  But you already know that, so I'm going to focus on what's new.  The remaster sounds great.  Although it is louder than the original, it doesn't suffer from the hyper compressed \\"loudness war\\" mastering that so many modern cds do.  Everything sounds full and detailed, but still has plenty of dynamic range.    The included dvd is a lot of fun.  The sound quality is lacking a bit compared to the studio material, but its acceptable.  The pumpkins were a band that was frequently accused of \\"sucking\\" live.  This was primarily due to two things. Firstly, and I say this with love, Billy Corgan is, err, not the greatest vocalist.  This is only more apparent in a live setting.  Secondly, the pumpkins jammed a lot live, they didn't play songs just like the studio recording, and they played a lot of non-album tracks.  Personally, I loved them for this second point, but a lot of people just wanted to hear nothing but the hits, just like the record. Anyway, to people who truly loved the pumpkins, they were at their best live, which is why the inclusion of the dvd is such a treasure.  I was amazed by how excited they all seemed and how much fun they seemed to be having.  By the time I saw them (just a few months after this was filmed) they were already in road weary rock star mode, and the mood was entirely different.  Not that they didn't put on a great show, they just didn't radiate nearly so much joy and excitement.   The packaging is also great.  You get a larger than usual booklet, comments from Billy on every song, and cool cards with artwork and lyrics.   The only real disappointment is the bonus disk.  On the plus side, these are all (as far as I can tell) previously unreleased versions of all these songs.  Which is saying something, because with the release of the huge rarities and bsides collection , nearly everything the pumpkins ever recorded is already out there. The negative is, these demos don't sound as good as their better known versions.  Like any demo it gives you some insight to the creative process, but isn't going to replace the proper version for everyday listening.  I would rather have remastered versions of drown and pisces iscariot stuff, even if it is previously released.

B0059XTUVI|3.0|I saw this movie yesterday.  I hadn't read any reviews first because I didn't want to taint the experience and well, it does star Meryl Streep and she is playing Margaret Thatcher so enough said!   What I can say without reservation is that Meryl Streep gave an outstanding performance. She played Margaret Thatcher in her prime and also in her declining years. In both cases, she had Thatcher's voice and mannerisms down pat. I believed she was Thatcher.  What I regretted about this movie was the script which centered around Thatcher in declining health, at times hallucinating and reflecting on her life and career at which point we relive them as well. We saw the influence her early family life had on her future in conservative politics. Also shown were her early forays into politics and then on toward being Prime Minister. What was annoying to me was that the film had us all too frequently go back to Thatcher in old age, rather than spend more time on Thatcher as Prime Minister.  Granted the film did depict some of the strife with the IRA, the effects in England of not negotiating with the labour unions and the Falklands War but they seemed all too fleeting.   During Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister, countries were economically and politically repositioning themselves re globalization and the end of the Cold War. Thatcher was also continuing England's special relationship with the United States via Ronald Reagan with whom she was politically in synch. In the film, if old-age Thatcher were to reflect, we should have gone back and relived those times and stayed there until she reached the old age Thatcher as she was reading the headlines of today or something along those lines.  This movie must be seen for Meryl Streep's performance for which there are not enough superlatives. She was great and well worth the price of admission.  Maybe there is another movie yet to be made about Margaret Thatcher and her political influence in England and the world. She was adynamic person to be sure.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|For a forty year old man, I found this game to be quite entertaining!!! Kind of reminded me of the patriot missiles used during Desert Storm...

B004UXUX4Q|4.0|\\"The Descendants\\" covers family relations in the wake of an impending death against a backdrop of squabbles over a massive land inheritance.  When money is involved, family squabbles are always at their most tawdry.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer based on Oahu with an attractive wife as well as two daughters aged 10 and 17.  His wife is involved in a tragic accident and becomes, essentially, a vegetable.  She is diagnosed never to regain consciousness.<br /><br />It is during this trauma that King learns that his much-adored wife had been cheating on him.  This comes a terrific shock.  He must manage this trauma while at the same time coming to a conclusion on a family inheritance that dates back to the time of Hawaiian annexation.  The decision involves hundred of millions of dollars and he has to balance the competing objectives of his various cousins who are all potential beneficiaries.<br /><br />Clooney plays the part magnificently.  He is a struggling parent who is trying to understand his daughters whilst simultaneously managing his own savaged emotions.  He is ably supported by a strong cast playing his daughters, the broader family and friends.  Clooney may well have played himself into an Oscar.  It is hard to conceive that he will not receive a nomination.<br /><br />I recommend this film strongly.  Yes, it's a tear jerker but it's also a wonderful performance that deserves high accolades.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very enjoyable, nice big cards and playing area make it fun and easy. random deal is great,  but other deals are also fun.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Sure, I'll support this boycott. George Lucas is the only weirdo in movie history who gets away with blocking release of his own film's original version. That's even nerdier than posting this review. Just release both versions, dumb-dumb!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its really fun and when I got it I was excited it has so many fun games I really require this game love it.
B000000OUW|1.0|Bought this one to because I saw them live and they played some songs I never heard so like a fan I wanted to crank out to more manowar tunes but did not care for this release and I based it on the amazon reviews pros vs cons I guess from now on I'll download music before i buy instead of basing my choice on others.just have to listen some more maybe I ll like one song from album
B004GFN11A|5.0|works great on my kindle fire, exactly what I was looking for to do a quick post or check on stats for all my blots, very convinient.
B0055SWM08|1.0|I feel bad giving this game such a low rating, when it's clearly a decent game (based on other reviews).  However, this game is absolutely unplayable on my tablet. It gives me the intro screen, the developer screen, a flash of the menu, then... a black screen and the intro screen again. Left on its own, this game would just continually reload itself endlessly until the cows came home. I can easily go \\"Back\\" to my home screen, but the game continues running (loading and reloading itself, I imagine) in the background until I go into my application management screen and force close it manually.  Hopefully, the developer will fix this problem in a future update. Otherwise, I'm out a dollar AND I can't play what seems to be a fun puzzle game. Bummer on both fronts :(
B005ZUR724|5.0|I have played WoW for nearly two years until I quit. When I found this game, I expected it to be less than that of WoW. So far, this game seems to be much better than WoW! There is not much lag during gameplay, and there is so much to do. I hope Gameloft adds more races and classes eventually.
B000005RSW|1.0|Another album that I did not know existed and bought.Had high hopes for this album but just found the music to be undesirable and i was a manowar fan growing up and just recently saw them live in new jersey and they played some music I never heard so I bought this title and some others (Like thunder in sky ,Into glory ride,Hail to England and Louder than hell)and in high hopes to blast manowar in my house but only found to lower the music because i was embarrased that my wife heard me listening to this release. maybe I ll have to listen a few more times to like it but in no rush for now
B0054JZC6E|4.0|:D super duper cool game! kinda frustrating at times but its fun and challenging. must get now!  i LoveBrian :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was soo worth it. it tops all my other games. it also helps that it is a free app.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This seems like it will be a great game once I become more adjusted to the gameplay. I am not too familiar with the controls.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It is clearly like the missile defense of old, but with nice new features. I like the mulit-touch targeting -- far superior than the old joystick. I like the idea of the upgrades too and the graphics are well done. A nice time waster that so far, doesn't take too much time (although with practice, maybe I'll live longer).
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on all my devices (Windows, Android, iOS).  It's great for constant access to all the information I have saved
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun to play when your bored but if you don't get enough coins you cant get other games and it gets boring
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun and points for unlocking more games are easy to come by. some of the in game controls are a little crude so it more than a light touch at times.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have used this.on the iphone and on the kindle fire and love it on both, however 4 stars for my account not being able to download versions I already have on my iphone. I thought that was the point of the account?
1400049628|5.0|[[ASIN:1400049628 The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead]]I bought this book as a gift for my coworker, who is a BIG zombie movie fan.  He and his teenage son, make the yearly Horrorfests, so you can tell he has a high level of interest Zombies and such.  He was pretty excited about the book, however, his son has borrowed the book and he has yet to really have a good look at the book.  Must be good!  Any way... his son told him that it was an excellent book!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|mini games controls can be difficult to manage, but it is overall very fun and a good way to waste time.
0743454537|4.0|I was torn the entire time I was reading this book. I could relate with the viewpoint of each of the characters.  The ending was a shocker! I enjoyed every page.
0525478817|3.0|As a 40 year old male, I'm not ashamed to admit I like John Green's books.  In each he seems to capture the essence of adolescence that remains with us into adulthood.  In my favorite book, An Abundance of Katherines, Green expertly captures the struggles of a gifted teen in ways that speak to what it is like to be a gifted adult.<br /><br />It The Fault in Our Stars, Green takes on teenagers facing terminal cancer.  Hazel Grace Lancaster is a teen living on borrowed time, with lung cancer and only a short time to live.  She meets Augustin \\"Gus\\" Waters, a cancer survivor, at a support group and soon they fall in love.  They bond over Hazel's favorite book,  \\"An Imperial Affliction\\", by the fictional Peter Van Houten.  The book tells the story of a girl with cancer and ends suddenly when the girl dies, and both Hazel and Gus long to learn what happens next.  As their romance blossoms, they conspire to meet Peter Van Houten, who lives in the Netherlands.<br /><br />While I cannot speak with experience, Green seems to expertly capture the feelings of children with cancer, who are strong not because of some great inner power, but because they have no other choice.  Gus and Hazel, and Gus's friend Issac all have authentic voices and relationships with their parents that feel true.  There are many times when Green, with a few lines of dialogue, brings tears to your eyes by simply detailing the words kids and parents exchange when faced with such terrible fates.<br /><br />Where the book falls short to me Peter Van Houten.  On the page, he never seems more than a plot device to hinge the book on.  While they help set up some wonderful sequences is Holland, the interaction with the character himself seems false, and only a way to setup the twist in the middle of the book and an ending that, without spoiling it, seems overwritten and false.<br /><br />Still, Green has a wonderful way of capturing the mindset of certain types of teenagers that feels timeless.  The Fault In Our Stars is worth the read.  Just bring a tissue.ring a tissue.
B0025KVLTM|1.0|This band has long since been lauded as the greatest band of their time, but with a closer look at the 60's era of music, it becomes apparent that the Beatles were surrounded by bands that were artistically superior to them. Bands such as The Rolling Stones, The Doors and The Who all displayed greater technical proficiency than The Beatles. The Beatles had some pleasant instrumental passages, but they seem pale in comparison to the transcendental instrumental passage of `Light My Fire' by The Doors. Out of all of their psychedelic music, none of it was as surreal and mind-bending as Pink Floyd's instrumental `Interstellar Overdrive' or Jefferson Airplane's hallucinogenic march-like anthem `White Rabbit'. While other bands used psychedelia as a medium to create powerful and original statements in music, The Beatles merely recycled circus music clichés and molded it into silly pop music such as they did with `Benefit of Mr. Kite'. In terms of lyrics, they seem shallow and dim-witted when contrasted to Dylan's poetry. Their messages were often trite and meaningless and reflected nothing of the revolution that was taken place during that time. Captain Beafheart, with his savage and seemingly demented - bordering on atonal - music of his masterpiece `Trout Mask Replica', painted a vivid picture of the heat of the turbulent revolution during late 60's and is a much more striking statement of that time than anything The Beatles had done. I'm not alone here. The following passage is taken from a review of `Lick My Decals Off' by Lester Bangs - who is undisputedly the greatest American rock critic:  \\"I'm gonna go not so very far at all out on a limb and say that Captain Beefheart is the most important musician to rise in the Sixties, far more significant and far-reaching than the Beatles, who only made pretty collages with material from the public domain, when you get right down to it\\"  Out of all the arguments defending The Beatles, I found none of them convincing. Most ofthese arguments do nothing other than illustrate very minor and insignificant technical innovations - most of which could have been easily done by just about any other descent rock band of the time. Whatever you think of these minor innovations, it doesn't change the fact that The Beatles almost always conformed to the simple verse-chorus-verse format of pop music. They placed their entire emphasis on melodic vocalization - nothing wrong with that in itself, but, with the Beatles music, it all sounds really banal. Their melodic pop songs are, for the most part, only a small step away from `Mary Had a Little Lamb'. Their voices are nice-sounding and agreeable but, to me, their vocal ranges seem very limited and their technical craftsmanship is weak. The music of the Beatles just seems dumbed-down, overly simplistic and - like a like plate of macaroni - it can be consumed without any intellectual strain whatsoever. And I think that's precisely why Beatles have risen to fame. People are taken in too easily by the Beatles `charm' but, with a closer look, it is evident that there is not much depth to their music. Serious art involves a tremendous amount of contemplation. But I wonder what there is to contemplate about with a ridiculous song like `Yellow Submarine'.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works perfect on Nextbook9. love it. i do not have any problem logging on. the program has never forzen on me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a great way to keep the kids occupied. Lots of choices. Good for all ages.  It's a great waiting room companion!
1609419693|5.0|I have always liked Tina Fey and think she is a wonderfully talented, clever, and witty person. But, now, after reading her book, I think she is actually brilliant! In this book she takes you through the very human trials and tribulations she experienced in her rise to becoming a household name. She is so very down-to-earth, and you can relate to all of the emotions she describes - and best of all (of course!) she does tells it all with that inimitable sense of humor she was gifted with, to make you laugh out loud.  I highly recommend this book.
B004A8ZWWY|5.0|This movie was very, very funny. I loved this movie in the theaters and I hope to buy it when it comes on sale as a Blu-Ray+Dvd+iTunes Digital Copy+UltraViolet Digital Copy. Since this is a Universal movie combo pack, you'll be able to have a choice between the digital copies just like when they released Cowboys & Aliens. So this is actually an \\"Watch it anywhere, Watch it anytime\\" movie.  5 stars out of 5. Grade A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a classic missile defense game. It is better than most other games of this type because it has the ability to upgrade the missile defense system and you can rebuild your buildings. If you like missile defense games, you will like this one above most others. I also had no lagging problems or any force closes. That is always a plus. Runs smoothly and plays well. Enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|These games are enjoyable and fun. I definitely see myself wasting lots of time playing them on my Kindle. I haven't gotten to the &quot;unlock&quot; stage yet but it's only a matter of time.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This was an ok book. Had a lot of potential but then sort of just petered out. Ending was very disappointing and hardly made any sense. Constant little political jabs got pretty old. A lot of Stephen King books end like this. Big build-up, hundreds of pages of detail, then poof...over. I would not bother with this book unless you just love Stephen King.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a good casual game. The graphics are nicely updated to a simple modern look and the game lends itself well to touchscreen devices. It gets hard quickly but is a good challenge and not too frustrating. Overall excellent.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Loved the first two books, the characters and development were amazing, which is the reason I was so disappointed with book three's ending.  I feel like Ms. Collins muse ran out on her, after such a wonderful build up going into book three, I expected better than the summarized ending and chapter that led to it, that was a let down.<br /><br />Overall I still enjoyed the series.
B000M341QE|5.0|http://www.amazon.com/Departed-Single-Disc-Widescreen-Leonardo-DiCaprio/dp/B000M341QE/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1326659847&sr=1-1  While the seller feedback option isn't available yet, I've already received the item from goHastings. They are prompt, deliver quality goods in a very short amount of time and I'm always happy with the product, whether it's a book, a cd or a dvd - this can be said of the numerous sellers I've dealt with, although I have ordered from goHastings quite a few times in the past year. The movie \\"The Departed\\" is a thriller/suspense/drama/action feature film with a superior cast and directed by Martin Scorcese, no less - talk about a seriously intense and engaging movie! Non-stop thrills, tension, constant action and interactions with the various characters, intriguing plots and sub-plots; just an all-around wonderful movie worth watching many times over. Everyone in the movie did a superb job and the movie was very enjoyable. Highly recommended!
B002VPE1X4|4.0|I got this for the Kodak Easy Share Sport.  I take it out on outrigger canoes in the ocean using this case on my belt of my camelback waist pack. The belt loop is velcro attached at one end but seems very secure. The extra pockets inside between the camera pocket and the belt loop, and another pocket under the flap will be handy for the spare battery and memory chip, but I don't carry them out on the water. The only things I can see that could be improved are that the velcro on the case side for the flap isn't large enough to keep it snugged down.  Also the top edge of the case is slightly constricted, which holds the camera in well but makes it a little hard to slip the camera in and out, especially one handed with gloves on.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Different games and all of them challenging.  It does have a lot of ads but its a free app.  Again, lots of fun!
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|DAUGHTRY - BREAK THE SPELL - DELUXE EDITION<br /><br />Daughtry graces us once again with a mix of some of the best of the best songs I've heard in a long time.  This long-awaited CD has something for everybody on it.  My favorites are CRAWLING BACK TO YOU, GONE TOO SOON, RESCUE ME, and LULLABY.  Chris Daughtry's voice sings no song wrong.<br /><br />The music is sharp and focused.  Vocals are rich and strong.  Lyrics are meaningful and ring true.  This CD does not disappoint -- not one little bit.<br /><br />I will never ever forget the look on Daughtry's face when he was voted off IDOL.  Chris -- look at you now!<br /><br />BRAVO!  BRAVO!  Highly recommended for all --<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pam
B004MC8CA2|4.0|A very good Bible resource that every Christian should have.  I especially enjoy the versions that have an audio Bible.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|once it hit level 24 it got crazy hard.  its a fun game for sure...it makes me want to keep playing to beat my high score.  get this game...totally worth it.
B000099T2L|4.0|I have no idea how I came to own this album but I am glad I have it.  I think this might be my favorite Beyonce album, until I get her \\"4\\" album anyway.  Even though I have all her stuff, I am still no Beyonce worshiper, she just knows how get hit albums and this solo debut is no exception.  I find there are only 2 throwaways on this album and one is the awkward \\"Hip-Hop Star\\" which is a little explicit (though I don't mind explicit at all, I don't like that kind material on this particular album) and the song was just too quirky for my taste.  The other is \\"That's How You Like It\\" I never warmed up to this song, I didn't like the production and even though I love sugary and sweet the fact that her boyfriend was on an already sugary song was just a sugar overdose for me, it was fluffy filler that was just annoying.  My favorites on the album are the dreamy \\"Be With You\\" in which she exhibits one of the better vocal performances on the album,and the song is mesmerizing, \\"Signs\\" is an awesome collaboration with Missy, it has good production and its just a fun song and has Missy's handiwork all over it, \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" features the collab with the legend, Luther Vandross and those two voices together in the sentimental ballad is heaven to the ears and my last favorite is the emotional title track, \\"Dangerously In Love\\".  I mainly like it for her vocals and it matches the dreamy confection of most of the album.  If you need more of an indicator of what you are in for when you get this album, just look at the album cover.  It has a dreamy look to it and that's how I would describe the album, its sugary and sweet and dreamy, a total girl album and I guess that's what I love about it, she's innocent and at times vulnerable but can toughen up when needed.  Its total Pop and that's what some down it for, but to me its good Pop and some of her best work.
B004KS96GW|5.0|Hace un par de meses lo compre para un portatil toshiba de 17.3\\" y me ha parecido excelente en todo aspecto: comdidad, diseno, precio, calidad, etc. Adicional el servicio postventa de Wenger es magnifico.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game itself is very good.  The idea of being able to get &quot;winning&quot; deals is a little disconcerning, but I never used it so I cannot comment on that, but the rest of the game is excellent quality.  The real deal breaker on this is the ads.  They pop up out of nowhere and if you click on it, it brings you to this movie clip.  Then, it pops up all the time like a virus.  I uninstalled the app and it still popped up.  I reset my browser to factory settings with all history and data deleted and it still popped up.  I finally got it to stop after deleting the app from my cloud.  I think that is why it stopped anyway.  Regardless, the ads were obviously out of control and overpowered the quality of the app.  If they offered this as a paid app ad-free, then I would buy it, but not with the ads.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game is just fine and it has a instruction button if you don't know what your doing it is right beside the play button...
B005K17RU0|5.0|I loved this app it had very accurate weather updates and I loved how its.always a notification. I have a kindle fire and use this app daily
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are some great games and some that are just ok. you have to built up coins to get new games. not all 101 games available at one time.
B005HSL626|4.0|its a very addicting game and you could play it all day long.. thanks for making it free:) its always the first app I go to..
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Very good at playing games but a little hard to get points to open all games. Easy to understand, but sometimes hard to beat.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's very easy to navigate, and it you even get your highlight the verses you want. It doesn't taller long to load either. I love it.!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have very specific files that have to use windows for work but I always thought how nice it would be to touch the screen where I want to click like on my tablet.  And now I can.  This app is so amazing
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have MobilityWare's solitaire app on 3 different devices and it works great on all three. I recommend this app to any solitaire player.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is very fun and addicting . i could play this for hours. i would definately refer this to any body.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I got this game for my new kindle fire. I really like it but it crashes every few minutes. it also doesn't give great instructions. the games are fun, well most of them. in the sushi game, the stick is hard to handle with your fingers on the kindle. Overall, hours of fun.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love it...takes me back. missile command remix. I would def say it's worth purchasing. though I got it as a free app of the day! :-)
B00008WT5M|5.0|This was the first record I owned as a kid, so my opinion is bias. If the first song on the album doesn't suck you in, just stop listening, because you're not going to get it. Like the folds says, \\"AC/DC is about power\\", and this album delivers.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I didn't enjoy Missile Command, but this game is fun. The touchscreen on the Fire really works well. The upgrades offer a goal in the game that the original never had. I easily was able to figure out how to stop the missiles and was challenged by new levels. It is a better game than the original!
B004I744AS|5.0|the best dictionary I have used so far! very fast!  most informative! good links to relative info!  just plain SUPERIOR!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the rope is an amazing game and a great time killer. Lots of levels and is a great app for anyone really. To all the people who rated the app low because of the lack of update, I doubt it's the dev's fault, so don't give the app a lower star rating then it deserves because amazon is bad. Keep the updates coming!
B00602MRAI|5.0|My wife loves Chris Cornell. I'm sure he could sing about how dirt is brown and she would swoon over it. This album is quite a bit better than dirt. If your playback system is of good quality, you'll be able to hear and feel that small room sensation. His voice is as always, clear and on key. The crowd in the background is well mixed, and adds nicely to the ambiance of the record. The songs are well worn, and always good to listen to.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A simple fun game. Well designed and easy to play. I liked it as did my children. Is worth checking out.
B000P0J09M|5.0|This is a great movie that is suppose to be a true story. Movies like Good Fellas and A Bronx Tale put me in a fantasie of being married to an Italian mobster. I know it's not the greatist life to choose from. I know there are a lot of dangers being married to the mob. But I think it is exciting. And would love the life of popularity and respect.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|my kiddoe sat on the couch with me and did all 125 levels in less than 10 minutes she thought it was great
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Downloaded for free today and have played it once. Not overly challenging but cute graphics. the &quot;noise&quot; isn't too hard to ignore, in fact, it help you identify the NUKES. Decent for a free game. The only reason I wouldn't have paid is because, for me, replayability is a bit low.  Great respond on the Kindle Fire.
0062082353|3.0|As one reviewer said, if you are interested in the life of Chris Kyle, this is the book for you.  It does have some good information on military tactics and his 4 tours in Iraq, and the details of battles...however it is lacking in details of specific \\"kill\\" or events engaging enemy combatants.  The writing is poorly done.  I found the constant inserting of comments from Chris' wife to be distracting to say the least.  Yes I am very glad Mr. Kyle saved the lives of so many American troops, yes I am glad there are 255 or so less people who wanted to kill Americans.    However, I found it somewhat odd that on one page Mr. Kyle would say that the SEALs were quiet professionals who didn't want publicity, and the next he would be talking about how he got into bar fights and arrested.    Fist fights and arrests pages 310 to 319.  His fight with \\"Scruff Face\\" (Jesse Ventura of UDT and BUD/S) page 310, his confrontation with Dick Couch (a VN era SEAL) page 319. I don't care for Jesse V. either, at least his political views...but come on.  What appear to be errors: page 336 \\"The army had decided...their rockets would reach the green zone..\\"  (think he meant would not reach the green zone. and page 109 typo: WSAIT for the next guy...  The book has some nice black and white photographs in a section in the middle.  Nicely published book, well bound and made.  I wish Mr. Kyle the best of luck in his civilian life, and thank him for his service and hope he gets plenty of money from book sales and his private company he runs.  For a book I consider a much better read on the subject of modern warfare, I suggest Lions of Kandahar by Rusty Bradley.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|Gia is a great movie. It's a true story so that makes it even better. It is very sad, what she went threw. It is sad that she choice her drugs over her girl. It is sad that she died with aids. Specially back when they didn't know what it was.

B005XQLBU4|1.0|On the Kindle Fire it just seemed kinda lame and boring.  Graphics were very simple, gameplay repetitive. Maybe OK on a smaller screen or after a nite out with friends. But IMHO not really even worth 'free.'
0446547654|5.0|Being an avid Nicholas Sparks fan, I know that his books will be a joy to read!  This book had the well developed characters that make his books so interesting, but the end was so unexpected.  I had to reread the ending to even believe it! Loved this book
B000002I27|4.0|This CD is great Doors album to get. It has a lot of the classics on it such as: Strange Days, Love Me Too Times, Moonlight Drive, and When The Music's Over. It also has some of the great lesser heard songs such as: My Eyes Have Seen You, Horse Latitudes, and Unhappy Girl. It's not thier best album but it will make you happy!
0380789019|4.0|Richard something, our protaganist is a sad wimp, who collects trolls (including his verging on abusive girlfriend.)One day he decides to good samaritan a bleeding (apparently homeless) young lass named Door. From there fantasy hits the fan. Richard is thrown into a world and a battle he barely can comprehend let along win.<br /><br />Neverwhere reads like a Gaiman comic in novel form. Splashes of wit, bizarre scenery and biblical plot are thrown together in a quick 300 page read, that won't take up too much of your afternoon.<br /><br />I guess my ownly criticism is I would prefer to see this in comic form, the novel didn't leave too much impact, and kinda felt like a sea of crazy fantasy with a few stepping stones of plot.<br /><br />Nonetheless Richard is a laugh, and Door is adorable (ha ha I'm terrible aren't I) - recommended for fantasy fans, and anyone needing a light read.
B005R4255C|5.0|This is one of the best collection of Michael Jackson's songs remixed the Cirque Du Soleil way!  Please note that this deluxe edition lists 11 tracks on Disk 1 and 11 tracks on disk 2 however the CD inside the protective sleeve does contain all 27 tracks; 15 tracks on Disk 1 and 12 tracks on Disk 2.  The outer sleeve pictured for this item is the not the same as what I received.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app. have it on my iphone/ipad. now on my kindle fire.  I just wish the kindle fire app could record like the Apple app.
B000002I2G|4.0|If you are thinking about getting this CD than DO IT. It's overall a great record. The songs that i found the best were: Touch Me, Shermans Blues, Wild Child, and Soft Parade. This album is one of The Doors weakest albums, However, It does have a lot of good songs on it. It does not go up to the power of the La Woman and Morrison Hotel albums.   If you are looking to buy a good Doors album than this is the one for you!
B00005LK94|1.0|My granddaughter said when she and her mother went to play the DVD it was cracked.  I don't know how or when this happened but I will have to get her another one.  Thanks anyway  Maxine Waggener (moseys_mom@yahoo.com).
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is okay for wasting time, but it's a little tedious at times. You have to unlock most the games instead being able to choose right away from all of them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am an avid Solitare player. It is easy and fun to play on my Kindle - better than on the computer. First game I downloaded!
B000MCIBE8|5.0|This is The Doors first album and i think it's thier best. All of the hits such as: Break On Through, Light My Fire, Soul Kitchen, and The End makes this album thier best. Every song on it is good. If you are purchasing a Doors album for the first time than this is definatly where to start.
B003PIUBZS|2.0|I love the series, I don't love the DVDs. For me it's a bit tricky to return them and have them replaced, so now I'm stuck with DVD's that get stuck here and there, jump parts and an Episode 8 I can't see at all. Not a happy camper here!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I am completely thrilled with my kindle firebook cover.  It protects against dropping, spilling and anything else that may cause damage, and it cleans up easily with a wipe of a damp cloth. The inside has a slot/pocket for a cleaning cloth or other small items.  Plus the design of the cover makes you feel like a world traveler.  Carrying handles would be a nice improvement.
B0012BV9FG|5.0|Awesome dino.  Huge and heavy.  Perfect for a rough and tumble three year old who's very into dinosaurs.  Would recommend to anybody.  Seems indestructible.  Love the little man that comes with the dino to show scale!

1936719118|5.0|I picked up this book a while ago based on a Seth Godin recommendation and I had forgotten about it in my queue until I stumbled upon and decided to give it a go.  Glad I did as it came to me just at the moment I decided to leave my job to pursue my passions.  Derek's book is one of concepts and principles which can be broadly applied across the spectrum.  I gained valuable insight and inspiration from this short book which I'm sure I'll reference again and again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a fun and interesting game that has a ton of games different in every way and it is amzing
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very nice mix of classic and new! This game is worth the download. Fun for the young and older crowd. Congrats to the developer and Amazon for a really good FAOTD!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good for killing time. challenging enough to be interesting, but does not require extreame skill. I reccomend downloading this app.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|A modern lord of the flies where the whole of society joins in. This book says a lot about human nature and is both thrilling and sad that it's all true. A must read that will end up being used in college reading lists.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its good. some seem impossible to complete, but good bonus' even if you don't complete it. fun anyway. try it
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A new twist on the old classic, a lot of fun. Runs well on Moto Triumph. and it's free. Good Job!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's pretty fun. Not the ultimate best app of all time(that would be Angry Birds), but it's working great for me. It says right in the description &quot;you start with 10 games&quot;. Why are you complaining? Also I didn't upgrade but I won't because of what the other reviews said. Like I said, pretty fun. My favorite game so far is Tornado Hockey.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|is a well done missile defender game. way better than the atari version, but after a Cretan point the game downs really progress l. if you liked the atari version you will love this one. good controls too
1451627289|4.0|I finished this book last night, and being the type that usually avoids reviews prior to reading to avoid spoilers, I hopped on Amazon this morning to check out what the other readers out there thought.  I was honestly surprised to see so many negative reviews, but happy to see so many positive ones!  I'll add mine to the list, trying to avoid spoilers along the way.    I really feel this is one of SK's better story-telling adventures in awhile.  It is a massive book, but nothing out of the ordinary for those that read \\"Under the Dome\\" or \\"The Stand.\\"  It reminded me a little of both those books, in a way, as I read it.  This is certainly a sci-fi premise, but it's the stories of the people that really touch you as you read.  Just like \\"The Stand,\\" this tale takes the ordinary people among us - and sometimes the not-so-ordinary - and explores their minds and hearts.  It isn't action-packed on every page as some of SK's works have been.  Rather, it does emphasize the daily, mundane tasks that make up everyone's lives.  The characters are great.  I had no trouble \\"getting into\\" Jake/George's psyche, as some others claimed.  The hardest character for me to grasp for most of the book was actually Sadie, but boy did she redeem herself!  Being small town myself, I liked the small town settings and the feeling of not only support but also judgment that dwells in all small towns, 1960s or 2012.  I enjoyed the interplay of the \\"harmonic\\" people and also found a lot of SK's coincidences to be apt, given the sci-fi tale.  It is a long read, like many have mentioned, without a bunch of in-your-face action throughout.  But the action scenes are ACTION and you know when they're coming.  Not macabre, but definitely detailed, a reader can skim if he/she has a queasy tummy for that type of thing.  Same goes for the love scenes, which didn't strike me as bad, but some reviewers found painful to read.    Finally - those that have fondly read other SK works - will LOVE the paths (orstrings, if you will) that pop up here.  Bev, Richie and a few others in Derry, a 'Takuro Spirit' in the \\"new\\" 2011 and a few others will bring a surprised smile to your face, if you remember those stories warmly.  I loved this book, it made me laugh out loud and it also brought me to tears.  It's not so much the story of the JFK assassination, but the story of LIFE before, during and after that national tragedy.  It only missed that 5th star from me because it did take me more than a week to read, meaning that I wasn't as fully invested as I have been in the past in books of similar length.    To all that undertake it, enjoy!!

0307477479|5.0|What is this book and what is `the goon squad'? If I can answer those two questions, I'm going to feel good about myself--myself being 62 years old and a writer of fiction and non-fiction, among other things. Okay - this book is fiction but not exactly a novel, although it has characters that recur from the beginning to the end. But it doesn't have a `plot' ... like life. Like life, this `novel' is also a collection of stories, but not only because they are related stories all intertwined with mystery, but because we don't know everything, we  have only clues, intimations - that maybe somehow there is meaning and purpose, but it's hazy. And that life is real and interesting and fascinating the way things  \\"happen.\\" Who can really say, what led to what? And what happens next? But some things are certain and unchanging, like: men are attracted to young, sexy women, and that those girls/women are attracted to men with power and charisma, and that \\"the goon squad\\" doesn't care about any of that. The goon squad is relentless.<br /><br />The stories occur, approximately, from 1980 to 2020 (I'm guessing.) They are not in chronological order. Some reviewers say it is about the Rock and Roll Industry ... well, sort of. That is sort of the glue that attaches all the characters together through time - the music industry from the 80s on into the future, beginning with a character, Lou Kline, born in approximately 1935, and the record company he was the `big man' of. So the stories flow from that. But also from one of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s, Bennie Salazar's assistant, Sasha, who is a kleptomaniac, which is where the `novel' begins. Somewhere in time around now, 2008. Sasha, is 35 and seeing a therapist for reasons that are not ever really understood. She does steal things. Which is where this strange book began, with the author, Jennifer Egan, in a public bathroom and a purse and wallet begging to be lifted ... and then one thing led to another and voil&agrave;, we have a Pulitzer Prize winning `novel.'<br /><br />The goon squad is, I think, what is commonly referred to as \\"father time.\\"(What happens between `A' & `B'.) It is referenced by characters in the book as that thing, that enemy, which cannot be defeated and eventually takes us all down. [My word, can I relate to that. Hunter Thompson called it the only real and true enemy - the face on the clock.] Jennifer Egan tells that story - How some us fight, and some don't, against getting old, but all of us eventually succumb. And I absolutely love the ending where the future is showed to belong to a young, beautiful, self-confident, young woman, Lulu, who is \\"`... going to run the world.\\"' (pg. 335)<br /><br />I think, Jennifer Egan is a peer of David Foster Wallace, and I see his influence. (Conscious or not.) In Infinite Jest (1996) Wallace `saw' the future of Phones, and Egan `sees' it, too. But further and farther along than Wallace. Egan calls the coming generation, those born into Now, where the world is at a person's fingertips - \\"pointers.\\" And imagines the world being dictated by the desires' of human babies being able to point and guilt their parents into meeting those desires. True? I don't know, but brilliant writing, imagination, and skill. Worthy of a Pulitzer.Pulitzer Prize winning `novel.'<br /><br />The goon squad is, I think, what is commonly referred to as \\"father time.\\"(What happens between `A' & `B'.)

B0064NTZJO|5.0|Don't wanna make a long review about every single thing that makes this movie genius (many here already have, many here will). I just wanted to ship in with a 5 star rating, 'cause it pains me to watch how those hardcore tranformers/fastandfurious/whatever-pop-corn-flick fans rate it with one star just because they didn't get it. I'm not calling anybody dumb, but the fact is that this movie isn't by any means a 1 star film, and giving it that just shows a lack of sensibility to the experience this movie gives. It's a polarizing film, not everyone will like it... but it's one thing to not like it and another to say it's bad. For example, i might not like melancholia, but i certainly understand why people like it and i know it doesn't by any means deserve a low rating. So.. back to Drive... No, it doesn't suck... No, it's not boring... No, there isn't any dialogue missing. The film is perfect as it is, its rare combination of elements create a 90 minutes breath-taking experience. The style is unique, and it perfectly belongs with the story and its characters. It's a beauty. This is a film that will be talked about decades from now, a true gem.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This Bible app is great. You can search it easily. The only problem is that it requires Internet connection. Otherwise it is great!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|To soon guys, way to soon.  Seeing that bomb aiming for that building just brought back way to many sad memories.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think it is the best bible app. I can see all of the language bible!!! and I can also write my recording.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|i like how you are like buying the games and then getting money after you play them. these games are woo unique and cool
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Some of the games are so frustrating but I can't seem to stop playing. Good times.  Even the younger kids can play.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great time waster! Has much more fleshed out graphics then the old Qatari Missile Command! Basically a must buy even when its not free!
B006JPS1OM|5.0|very interesting. game. finding object games are always fun. I would definitely recommended. this one for sure. would love to see more like it..
0385534639|2.0|This book had a long build up with a disappointing climax. The whole time reading, I was expecting something exciting to occur and it never did. I didn't feel any connection to the main characters at all. I found them uninteresting and not that likable. My favorite characters were the twins who were only supporting characters.  I had no problems putting this book down to do other things. I found myself relieved to be done with it.
B000FBFN1U|1.0|I read A Game of Thrones and was enthralled. It was fun, fresh, and alive. I loved most of the characters and the setting. After reading A Clash of Kings I was even more caught up into the epic. It was refreshing to see a story where the good guy doesn't always win, and yet you could still hope for a dawn after the long night. The sense of foreboding that developed as I became aware of the danger that the coming Winter represented while the kingdom of Westeros ripped itself apart with political intrigue was delicious. And then I started reading this book. I am halfway through and deleting it from my kindle. I sincerly regret having already perchased the next book in advance of finishing this one. The story has stalled out with plot development becoming a endangered species. All the characters i enjoyed are dead and the rest arn't interesting enough to get me through another chapter hoping to find another one that I can stand. In short, the series seems to have devolved into one a repition of teasing hopefulness and tragic dissapointment as each and every hero is betrayed to their death with no sign of justice in sight. I love a good dark series, but you need a strong light in order to cast a deep shadow. The series is no longer fun and every chapter feels like a job, to the extent that I get the same sense of relief upon completing one that I feel when I leave work at the end of the week and have a whole weekend free of obligation.
B0034G4P94|4.0|It seems I always have some kind of sports-related film on my best-of-the-year lists ([[ASIN:B001TOD92C The Wrestler]], [[ASIN:B004LOJPLQ The Fighter]]), and this year was no different. Most critics fell in love with Brad Pitt's [[ASIN:B006MQRLSA Moneyball]], but it was this mixed martial artist fighter film about family that I thought shined the most this past year. \\"Warrior\\" -- as the previous fighting films mentioned before -- is about more than just fighting; it's about two estranged brothers, both of whom have childhoods that they are simply trying to move on from. Big brother Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) has a wife and two daughters that he is trying his hardest to support on his meager high school physics teacher salary while little brother Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a Marine who has come home to his former alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) in hopes to win prize money for the wife and son of a fallen comrade. The two enter the same tournament where they soon will have to face and fight each other. The film is more than a fight movie; this is a film about confronting one's issues and facing unfinished business. Director Gavin O'Connor ([[ASIN:B0001US66E Miracle (Widescreen Edition)]]) brings great pacing and story to the film, with an ending that leaves \\"Moneyball\\" in the dust.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|This game is okay. I wish it allowed me to play all the games without having to unlock all of them except those first few games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Incredible app. Use it everyday. I try to tell everyone I see with a smart phone, or tablet about this app. I would rate it six stars(if that were possible), if there were links to bible dictionary and/or commentaries.
0151002002|5.0|I received my first copy of this edition of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" many, many years ago from my parents.  We developed a tradition of reading it aloud each year in the days before Christmas and using Roberto Innocenti's gorgeously illustrated version of Dickens' classic tale of redemption, or rather, \\"reclamation,\\" as one Ghost puts it, made this tradition even more delightful.  Dickens' wordsmithing sets a standard few authors reach and reveals a desire not only to make humanity better but make more faithful the practice of the religion (Christianity) which constantly underscores the words and actions of the characters.  Innocenti's illustrations reveal many hours of research into the clothing and look of 1830s London, as well as many hours spent illustrating the author's words down to some of the briefest references.  Each time one looks at an illustration one notices some new charming detail: the drops of blood from a goose's neck on the snow, the Marley-haunted tiles around Scrooge's fireplace, piles of bones in old Joe's shop.  The copy I received--my second copy--was in even better condition than I anticipated; while not brand new, it obviously had never been opened.  I recommend this edition of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" to everyone who loves the story.  You will not be disappointed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app runs in the background of the Kindle Fire.and allows for quick access to the app.  Highly recommend it.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I was beginning to think that America could only give the world great TV series in the last few years, so disappointing has been the \\"best movies\\"of recent times. Yet here comes a film that in its wonderful,quirky way harks back to the days when family dramas actually made box office and were high quality (\\"Ordinary People\\", \\"Terms of Endearment\\"etc).So it is so refreshing in this age of high tech ,fantasy and action movies, that a film as real ,truthful,clever and emotional as this can succeed and not be released as a telemovie. \\"The Descendants' together with \\"The Help\\"gives one some hope for the American film industry.
1935670913|5.0|Thanks to John Locke for this book. The book describes how to harness new technology to increase readership. It is easy to understand as it doesn't get too technical - which for a Luddite like myself is important.   I have 11 books in print which have sold well. Like the author I appreciate the relationship between reader and author. For ten years I have been doing book signings and talks and have encouraged people to email and/or write to me - I even have postcards with all my contact details which I give out as book-markers. John Locke describes the importance of the GBL - Guaranteed Buyer List. I found myself nodding repeatedly while reading this section. I liked the humility he showed and lack of ego - it is ONLY through the loyalty of our readers that our work is read and appreciated. That is something which must never be taken for granted.   I had been struggling with the new technology and this book has helped enormously. I found it be both inspirational as well as practical. I read \\"How I sold a Million ebooks in 5 months\\" in Nov 2011 and took action! I now have a blog on my website, have started using twitter and improved my facebook page.  Thanks to this author's generosity in sharing his tips for success I now have steadily growing Kindle sales with all my books. This is led by A Million Tears (The Tears Series) and Mayhem (The Nick Hunter Series).  Thanks again.
1603420398|4.0|I really liked this book. The motifs were beautiful and the patterns were easy to follow.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it would have been nice if she had any sort of suggestions on how to use the completed motifs.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great version of a classic game! it runs smooth and holds your interest.the sound could be better but it doesnt take away from the simple yet fun gameplay.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|20 nights later a finally put it down. Well done. Could use different scenes but awesome reminder of the arcade classic.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Got this at a wonderful price and in a timely fashion.  I am very pleased with the service.  I so enjoy ordering from you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is awesome. Some of them are really hard to pass but its all a part of the entertainment.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|a great game and everybody I know that has this game (which is most) loves this game :)! ! ! !
B000K09OL6|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson who is 4 1/2.  I live far away, so I haven't seen him play with the blocks, but his mother reports that the whole family (parents and 18-month-old brother) spend lots of time together playing with the blocks, so I'd say it's been a great success!
078689136X|5.0|Purchased this book for a Christmas present.  Instead of having it shipped to me I had it sent to my niece.  It arrived quickly and in new condition.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|concept is very cool. a lil bit of ads but not terribly intrusive so its bearable. cant wait to unlock the. games
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Good remote app. Haven't used this a ton yet but has been great so far! Easy setup with gmail login. (Windows)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are very entertaing. I have enjoyed playing some of the games. some games are very challenging and others are easy going.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this seems like an alright game I haven't really played they much of it. I think its worth the try every person is different
B0036EH3WK|5.0|My purchase was shipped and received very fast, it was all packaged very nicely and so far I'm enjoying one of the best Drama's in TV history.  I checked all DVD's when they came, they were all accounted for and no scratches.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It took me a while to figure out exactly how to play, but in the meantime, it was fun to play without knowing how to get the 3 stars.  My 4 year old granddaughter loves playing too.  You must use logic, speed, and timing to get 3 stars and have the candy fall into the frog's mouth at the end.  When you first see some of the \\"obstacle courses\\" you wonder how it is possible, then as you replay the game you begin to see how it can be done. You can replay or go back and start over if you like. There are many levels and several different \\"boxes\\" with different tools to play the game.  A fun little entertainment.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very similar to Atari's Missile Command with better graphics and easy touch game play.  I like how you can upgrade you defense, but it's pretty tough to recover if you fall behind on a level.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like most of the games some are kinds stupid but overall I likebit. my 3 year old can even play somebody them
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Pretty easy to set up and use. Nice way to bring just your Kindle to meetings at work and still be able to access your desktop.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|you don't need a lot of high definition graphics for it to be a good game. this game is about strategy and skill. this is a game I will play over and over again.
0525478817|5.0|I haven't read it yet, but I received my signed copy in the mail yesterday. Can I just take a moment to say the John Green is the most asdfghklt! author ever. 150,000 signed copies. DFTBA.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|awesome game. it reminds me of the oldschool game missile command. the graphics are good and my wife and i loved it. it is the only game my wife and i played together. i think we will buy the full version.
034552554X|4.0|I have read with great interest the reviews of other readers, and I agree with most of them, which is why I give The Language of Flowers only four stars rather than five. I, too, could not put down this book, yet I did not want it to end, so I was torn between these two emotions. I find the primary character, Victoria, to be well drawn, especially in terms of her lack of trust. The book weaves the stories of the ten year old Victoria alongside the eighteen year old Victoria, allowing readers to see why Victoria reacts in the way that she does. If we did not have this juxtaposition, I think the older Victoria would truly frustrate us. I agree that the last part of the book is almost too good to be true, but if we look at this book in terms of redemption, not only of Victoria but of Elizabeth--and in some ways Grant--then we can more easily buy into the seemingly predictable ending.  I love the way the author, Vanessa Diffenbaugh, allows us into Victoria, the young and the older, walking us through, helping us feel Victoria's emotions. I also feel that when we discover what is restricting Elizabeth, we understand that Victoria, whilst loved by Elizabeth, cannot truly be given the love that Victoria needs until something in Elizabeth's own life is resolved. I wondered how Elizabeth could not understand more fully what she has done to Victoria when she misses an important day/date in Victoria's. This is a little strange, for clearly she understands Victoria but also cannot see that that what is restricting herself means she cannot resolve some of the realities of Victoria's life.  Grant is almost too good to be true, but he is privy to not only the eighteen year old Victoria, but also the ten year old, so he understands what she lacks in life. The character of Marlena is also just a little too good to be true, especially given that she, too, has been brought up in the foster system.  Whilst some readers feel that several of the main characters should have known to ask Victoria whether she had enough food, they do offer help, which Victoria cannot accept. Again, this is because of what holds Victoria back, what she feels that she should be able to do--be  what she feels to be a perfect mother but cannot.  The strongest part of this book is the exploration of the title, the language of flowers. This unfodls beautifully throughout much of the book. In addition, if a reader has forgotten the particular meaning of a flower, the author has supplied an easy reference index at the back of the book. I also loved the way Victoria intuited what people needed or what she needed in terms of flowers. Whilst several readers have felt this too be a little unlikely, I do believe (or want to believe) that people have a connection to things that others do not, can see in them possibilities that others cannot. For example, I love how she lines her baby's Moses's basket.   Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this first time effort by Vanessa Diffenbaugh. She writes clearly and effectively, bringing to life elements of her book as though they they were illustrated, for example the garden that Victoria creates. I was sad, however, that though I have done many things with my life, including being a wife and mother, I do not feel that I have ever felt such a close connection to something in my world as Victoria does to her world of flowers, for she enters this world, letting it wrap completely around her, becoming part of it. Clearly, I need to still look. When I find it, I hope that I can let it surround those I love as well.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave as well as many other bands sets the bar high after a heavy, beautifully melodic opening album. Tom Morello shows his best work on the guitar using the whammy, wah, tremolo, and delay with a less experimental sound. It's appropriately refined for this mash-up of Rage Against the Machine's powerhouse instrumentalists and the warm vocals of Chris Cornell. There are no \\"B-sides\\" on this album. I've listened to these songs over and over since 2003, shortly after the album came out. I play and teach guitar and use some of these songs for teaching students about effects and other advanced techniques. The musical marriage of heavy guitar riffs, sweeping bass lines from the mastermind Tim Commerford, and simple and elegant percussion by Brad Wilk glued together by Cornell's rock vocals creates Audioslave.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've used YouVersion to read the Bible on the Internet, on my iphone, and now on my Kindle. The app is fast and it has never lost my place in my readinng (a problem common to other sites and apps I've tried).  For the casual reader, you will enjoy the ease of use. The app is easy to operate, with intuitive functionality. For the person like me who needs to study the Bible, you will like the 100s of translations available from a quick click or touch on the reading pane. Since the app resides on the web, I'm able to access it via multiple devices without losing my place.  I haven't found anything to complain about!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is a highly amusing Christmas story that the whole family will enjoy. The Muppets are funny by themselves, but when coupled with this classic Christmas tale they are even more enthralling. Many great songs to sing along with and keeps moving so you get pulled right in and stay that way.
B0055SWM08|4.0|It's an amusing game, but not as entertaining as other puzzle games on Amazon such as 'cut the rope' or 'where's my water'. Its not the end all be all game some of the reviewers have acted like it is but its worth downloading.
1609611543|5.0|This book was my aha moment!  When I used to eat certain wheat snacks, like Wheat Thins, I always noticed I would get hives, headaches but I never made the connection I may be allergic to wheat.  This book helped me understand exactly how my wheat allergy has negatively affected my health.  Giving up wheat, I have cleared up allergies, congestion, indigestion, bloating and cramping.<br /><br />I would have liked a clearer understanding on wheat vs. gluten since you hear so much in the media about gluten these days.  So, I had to do my own research to better understand the differences.  But what the book does very well is get to the heart of how to avoid all wheat, including breakfast cereals, breads, pasta, pretzels and other wheat products.  He encourages us to eat fruits, veggies, lean proteins, raw nuts and seeds, healthy oils.  I concur and follow allow of his suggestions and my health continues to improve everyday.  I feel like I'm twenty years younger!<br /><br />As a result of this book, I further went on to learn about other food allergies that causes weight gain, puffiness, bloating, and indigestion. My health has dramatically improved but not just because of wheat, but I also eliminate any foods that are unhealthy, fattening, or addictive, including white refined sugar, processed foods, boxed/instant foods.  I focus my eating on clean, healthy, organic, natural are raw foods... that keeps me healthy, balanced, and happy.
B0064BCNA4|3.0|I like this app but the multi-touch isn't particularly outstanding on my EVO 3D. As the responsiveness is said, by the developer, to vary from device to device, I can't possibly blame the app. its nice to have and works well enough. Try it and get a first hand experience of the app's performance on your specific device.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. Helps pass the time. Before you know it, your late because you cant put it down.
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|I bought it as fast I could, when special edition wasn't avaliable.  Blue Ray Disc 1 includes all 6 episodes + extra content. The seoncd one is also a blu ray and has bonus content.  Only the episodes has spanish subtitles, extras doesn't. That's why I gave it 4 stars.  Right now, for the price, you can buy the special edition wich includes a 3rd bluray disc. Even so, this is a great version.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is very easy to use. I use it every day to make my plans according to weather. very accurate forecasts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a cool game fun to play at times but then it gets boring if you don't have enough money
B0040UAYI4|5.0|After loading the disk and following the instructions, I used this device on games that I had for the PS3. I am a long time PC 1st person shooter player and never became good with the joy stick or gamepad that is used on consoles. This device allowed me to use the keyboard and mouse and now I am enjoying playing my games on the PS3 and my 55 inch HD TV monitor. Glad I bought this.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Simple yet fun game I'll be keeping it on my phone for a while, prefect game to be able to waist done time
B006JPS1OM|3.0|hard to tap items, need to zoom in and out too much. good graphics tho. needs to be faster, less storytime
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Saw this as the free app of the day and grabbed it. Glad I did. Nice Middle Command type of game with the ability to upgrade weapons. Runs smooth and with no problems. Touch controls work with precision and speed. Definitely worth getting if you like this style of game.
B003KUZSWW|4.0|Yes, i understand that for licensing reasons the last few EPs are not available for free.  however they are for sale (go figure). it may take another 18 months after the original EP air date before they can be free online. is that BBC air date or BBCamerica air date? who knows but here's hoping for sooner then later.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|I played this on the Kindle Fire, and no lag but starting off with a limit of 30 missiles and being unable to buy.more is really cheap. Also, you cant shoot in the direction of the missile, you have to shoot flawlessly at the missiles trajectory. I find it ridiculous that you need to have all your buildings to buy something.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some are hard to unlock but the games can really hook you! Overall it was interesting and challenging at times.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I read the reveiws and decided to get it. super great app I'm so glad came across this app. you won't be dissapointed
0525478817|5.0|I could not put this book down!! Such a beautifully written story made even better by the signature on the first page. This book goes beyond fiction and merges with real life. I loved it! DFTBA
B005EZJ3MW|1.0|What a waste of my time and money; a sorely disappointing purchase. It actually COST me more<br />Shopping Amazon than if I'd bought retail. The Demi Lovato CD didn't<br />Work properly, so I ended up buying the music off iTunes, because returning the CD would have<br />Been more expensive than an iTunes purchase.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Down loaded for free, very simple to use, some nice features, like autocomplete. I enjoy playing it more than most other solitaire that ive downloaded._
B0037N7XEI|3.0|I much prefer reading the books instead. After I saw this, it seemed a litte cheesey and a little sluttyish (new word).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|play this game.all the time.on my kindle fire. haven't had a single problem besides failure with some games. but it's really worth the.download. besides.it's free!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great resource for syncing data btw devices. I use it for shopping lists, general notes and even to take picture memos. I can send any note or list via text or email, etc to share and I love that feature too.
B005DC68NI|5.0|This is the book I'd recommend for those considering self publishing. There are so many blog posts out there, and articles, but the information is often hyped up.<br /><br />David analyzes the information and points out trends, and the implication they have on the industry. I consider myself to know a lot and even I learned something.<br /><br />I didn't think the 'guest' articles at the end were necessary, as some didn't always add to the discussion. I'd have preferred the book to be without them. I'd recommend that most people skip them unless there is a specific case study you're after.<br /><br />Overall, this will save you a bucket-load of time and help you make smarter decisions.
8862937148|4.0|Item arrived promptly and as-described. I've been using this particular diary for years. I wish it came in other colours! It's the most versatile of the Moleskin diaries, but it only comes in black.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some games are fun but some are boring kind of annoying that you have to get all those points though in my opinion
B0042X9L6A|4.0|The Flash functions are amazing,  A little bit oversized (is almoust the same size as the D5000 camera body).  The batteries are the real problem of this flash, at first it recover for the next shoot immediately, it can even follow the continuos shooting of the camera). After 2 days It takes 1 of 5 auto shoot. And after 4 days I need to wait for 1 minute.  Consider that I took about 200 photos on the 5 days.  So if you are willing to find a space on your camera bag for it, and a spare set of batteries this is a great flash.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I loved this game when I was a kid. Glad to see it show up here. game pay is simple and straight forward. Just simple fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game its the game they keeps on giving I would sugrst this tocsll all of. lmg friend
1573300403|2.0|I actually like the material on this DVD -- BUT it does not work on a computer.  It has some kind of copy protection.  Then it would not eject from my mac mini.

B005HSL626|5.0|I got this for my Kindle Fire and I love it! Its super fun and VERY addicting! Even my 2 year old likes it!
0545265355|5.0|I seen this product in Barnes and Noble and I knew my son was looking for it.  I waited until I got home and found it cheaper and stil could get it by Christmas.  I am very happy with my order

0060873086|4.0|I just finished reading (actually, listening, I chose to hear the Unabridged Audiobook first instead, since I drive so much all the time lately) MICRO. I have to disagree with a lot of reviews and say that I really enjoyed this novel, and thought for a work that was completed by someone else that it really DID seem to evoke a lot of his spirit, style, and interest. I thought it was a great fast-paced adventure that had just enough buildup before it skyrocketed into action. I can see the Jurassic Park III comparison in the story's style and pace, but perhaps Crichton wanted it that way. He wanted to change things up after his more outlandish works like State of Fear and Next. He wanted to have more fun with this one.  Perhaps the only thing I didn't like about this novel was a certain VERY annoying and idiotic character. Crichton has always had eccentric and strange characters scattered throughout his books (like Ian Malcolm), but this particular one gets so annoying and makes so many cringe-worthy mistakes that you are screaming, \\"DIE DIE DIE\\", as hard as your lungs will allow them. You also never truly find out exactly why Vin Drake is so evil, although you can perhaps assume he just got caught up in the power of the work he was involved in. This novel also, funny enough, has what I call the classic Crichton \\"sudden ending\\", where there is barely enough resolution after the climax. I was actually hoping for a more satisfying resolution after the stirring climax.  Some things that happen in this novel are hard to believe, but at least even Preston is able to still make it all be understandable. The knowledge on the insects is actually the highlight of the novel, as are their various attacks. Seriously, this book goes into overdrive near the middle in the consistency and intensity of insect (and other creature) attacks. The death rates also spike up during this impressive and thrilling section that would make a fantastic film. There are splendidly gross and creative\\"Crichton deaths\\" to be found as well. Some parts were so disturbing in their telling that I almost wanted to stop! And you'll be surprised by which characters make it and which don't throughout this story. There was definitely one that I really didn't see coming and was actually really shocked when it happened.  I hope more people read this novel, because I can see a lot of people enjoying this if they give it a chance. It isn't perfect by any means, but it is now my favorite book with his name on it since Prey! It's sort of a cross between Prey, Jurassic Park, and Timeline in it's story structure, style, and subject.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the best very cool awesome yeah wahoo cool da best like it oh yeah that's what I am talking about
B004MC8CA2|3.0|So far I have downloaded several versions of the Bible to my Kindle Fire.  I was under the impression I would be able to use them in Church without WiFi. I still get error messages saying it can't connect with the server.  When I can read the Bible without WiFi I can not use the Search Feature nor the highlighting feature.  Can someone tell me which version of YouVersion is most suited for the new Kindle Fire?  Perhaps I am using the wrong version?  So far have not gotten any response from the techs.  If you have answers please email me at loosinit2@bellsouth.net.  I really need to be able to use this app when in Church without WiFi.  Thanks
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game could have better graphics and gameplay, and doesn't give you 100 full games, but it is a great way to get a variety of games for free.  There is a fast-paced quality to the games, and this would be great for someone with a short attention span.  So, although th games aren't the most impressive, and none of them have accelerometer controls, this game is worth having just because of the value.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great game!!!!!!!!!! just got Irving my kindle fire and am currently addicted!!!!!! I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good game on the kindle fire!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun and so addicting! I love how its so easy to unlock more levels!! download it too you'll love it.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Hello, Halestorm This is the hottest group around I love this band and can't wait for their next album comming out this year. Lizzy is awsome singer and performer I just love her, I saw them at the Mohegan Sun they were GREAT !!!! KICK ASS band. Keep Rocking !!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great way to pass the time mindlessly! I enjoy the variety and simplicity of the games that make them.somewhat complex. I reccommend this!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|This is not classic prose, nor meant to be. But this is a fun read from which I learned. I learned the life of a modern American warrior to whom our nation owes so much. War is hell for the warrior and their worried spouses. The evil they face every day is real and dangerous.  The liberals who pan this book do so in nasty and snarky ways so prevalent in the left these days. Liberals display the same disgust for the author that they feel for America. A younger me would do to liberals what the author did to Jessie Ventura.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the multiple gaming is so much fun I cant stop its so addicting to reach the goal and finish it finally
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I use this as initial reconnaissance for wifi coverage when traveling overseas. Why pay to talk if I can Skype?  Maybe color code to show which are locked and which are not.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun game to play with lots of variety. I would recommend this game if ur a couch potato! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this ap. Clear smooth graphics. Each level gets much faster, upgrades are a must. Very addictive. You should try it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|If your good at these games. this would be your game but if your like one of people who think there good at games and u suck at it trust me don't get it. its hard fore the truth I made it to Lvov 5 that's sad lolololol
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app. quality. enjoyable and fun. well worth the download.especially since its free. probably wouldn't be worth money, but for a free app its great
B0054JZC6E|2.0|it is adicting and really fun at the beginning but after a while it gets boring. I would not regimens this game to people over 13 like me
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Multi touch device is necessary. Its a fun game to play through very quickly though. The dialogue is corny but fun.
B002BWP49C|4.0|I have read books one, two, and four, and I am working on three. I own all the movies (except for this one because it is not available yet). I read this book before I saw the movie so I was looking very forward to it. It was a good movie, however it left out a lot of details that I thought were very important. The honeymoon scene should have been more like the book, and the birth scene should have been less like the book, it was disturbing and gross. They probably left out some of the honeymoon to make it pg-13 instead of R, but that birth scene should have made it R rated! For the first part of the last book, it just was not detailed enough. For me personally, I could have sat through a 3 and 1/2 hour movie at least to have the detail. I hope the last part is much longer and more detailed!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great for saving files to mobile devices (especially colleges kids). keeps them organized well and doesn't have a lot of problems. must have app for organization
B001UV4XIS|2.0|My purpose in purchasing this dvd was to complete my series.  I've enjoyed all the movies.  My primary concern then would be quality of the dvd.  This one disappointed me as the video was so dark, it was difficult to see the characters in many of the scenes.  I'd seen the movie on TV and though some scenes were dark, nothing like this dvd.  So, I was disappointed in the quality of the dvd itself, but the movie was great.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|kinda fun...... don't  like the (certain)mini games.to hard go unlock and for completeing games they don't give you enough points.
B000W746GK|4.0|My first thought would be ease of viewing, quality of the dvd itself.  This one was decent. I'd seen the movie before so mostly I would want a quality tape.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the games like the soccer game and the dart game I also like the tank game and the dirty gold
B000W74EQC|4.0|I love the Harry Potter series so owning them all was important.  Also important would be the quality of the dvd itself so that I could watch it more than once and it would survive the test of time.  This dvd was very good and easy to watch.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice hj j j j.j j k s s f e be d e. sd. s. s s s x. ff
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun and lots of variety in this game ....I really like it a lot...one of my favorite games for kindle
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its Ok I Guess, I Like It So Far But I Just Downloaded The Game Soooo I Will Have Too Wait. Some Of The Games Are Hard.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great...one of fave apps! Use it all the time, even in church. SO glad its free and avail to all!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|of being able to transfer my sticky notes to this app. The calendar is great, but I would like something with times and repeats, but I already have one for that. If you're looking for a digital way to make numerous reminders and lists and be able to categorize them, this is a great app.
0525478817|5.0|I am a huge John Green fan, but must say I was a bit worried when the topic of The Fault in Our Stars was revealed.  After all, how was a book about two teens dying from cancer not going to be terrifically sad?  How was it not going to contain countless platitudes about living life to the fullest that would ultimately ring hollow?  And if it didn't contain such useless encouragements, wouldn't it seem crass and harsh?  I needn't have worried.  While the book did include many traditionally trite phrases, Hazel and Augustus give said statements their just irreverence, yet seem to understand the need for some of their friends and family to have the words said.  Hazel and Augustus appreciate the cliche of their short, unfortunate love story.  I  think the highest compliment I can pay this novel is that I didn't weep uncontrollably at its sadness. Knowing the gist of the plot in advance gave me a chance to read beyond the the storyline and appreciate the crisp, poetic language.  There are so many beautiful phrases, but I'll end my review with my favorite: \\"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you.  I like my choices.  I hope she likes hers.\\"
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons, but those pigs are just so annoying!  This game is a good update to the original featuring new birds and no pigs!  In the first level, you are rescuing birds and the other level there are birds and monkeys, which are just adorable.<br /><br />I am not sure if it was me or not, but the first levels were so easy, but very fun to play!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun game to play!  It works well on my Kindle, and I have had no problems with it.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This is a wonderful series. Acting is great.  Storyline is great. I wish Showtime would have a second part on this series. I would not recommend for children and young teens because of the violent sex scenes.
0307593312|5.0|Great transaction.  It arrived on time, was just what I expected, and was in good shape.  I'd order from this dealer again.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I was pleased to play this game again after many years. The ability to level up different attributes was welcome. The graphics were appropriate and the gameplay solid. Wish I could have upgraded past level 5.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a fun take on Missile Command and one of the best I've played, if not the best. I love the upgrading feature and ability to repair buildings. I'd gladly pay for this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love tow app it passes time if u really like it I have played it on my dads phone I started at five and I ended at seven.
014241493X|5.0|The theme of this book absolutely blew my mind. At this juncture of my life, I had been grasping at little pieces of this idea, but was unable to unify them into something that was articulate. This book not only articulated what I had been trying to piece together for so many months, but did so in a funny, beautiful way, full of somewhat pretentious literary references that makes a future English like me want to reread Paper Towns over and over again in the hopes of stumbling upon new meanings and interpretations of the same chapters- which I did. Like how reading Little Women made Mom read Pilgrim's Progress, Paper Towns caused me to attempt to read Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass- something I could not manage to do at the time, although I still believe it is a worthwhile pursuit. Paper Towns is my favorite book, and I think everyone in the world should read it, as to gain insights to imagining others complexly.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a lot of fun. I recommend. this app. I got it for free but it is still worth the money. __
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a great take on the classic Missile Command game. I actually may even like it better than the original. The touch controls are spot on and the weapon upgrade system is very cool. Things certainly get hectic after a while!
0312641893|5.0|This book...sigh. It ROCKS! Seriously. It's one of the most creative concepts out there. A cyborg Cinderella story? With Aliens? Yeah. Sounds wild, but it's done SO well. If you want a fun, explosive read, pick it up!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|intuitive to play, graphics well done.  what other people are saying about backgrounds, cmon it's the free app of the day.  what else is there to say?  worked flawlessly on galaxy nexus.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|If you like missile command, you will  like this game.  Just has way better graphics than the original.  I got sucked into it.  Its a good way to pass the time when you need to.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love it, this is a great game. good graphics, good touch controls. great wast of time game. highly recommend
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good way to burn a few  minutes. I recommend it. Not a bad price either. Very simple game though so don't expect an intricate story line.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I've been playing casual games for several years but they were all created for PC/laptop use.  This was my first android game which I played on my wonderful Kindle Fire and I had a lot of fun with it.  There's no guidance or hints, you just kind of stumble through it but the graphics were so clear and well done that there was no pixel hunting involved.  As many others have already said, the only negative comment I could make is that the game is very short.  However, that makes sense since large file games wouldn't work so well on a phone, right?  Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys this type of game, it's very well done.
B0060ZJ74O|1.0|That's it really.  I love this movie, but I've seen it once in a theater -- and I'd rather NEVER see it again, rather than pay for an UltraViolet anything.  Period.  Any movie.  Any time.  Never buying UltraViolet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this app is pretty great. while I agree with others that after a while it gets harder and harder to get enough points for games, by that point you have a lot of other games to play. no one ever asked you to commit your life to opening every game. this app is perfect for anytime you are bored in a waiting room or airport, and you just need something entertaining to pass the time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|love it... keeps my interest for hours and great graphics on the galaxy nexus as well... my new favorite game!
0545403359|5.0|Wow--what a good story.  I know it was written for the younger crowd, but this is a book you can get lost in at any age.  The copy I got was in great condition and arrived before I expected it to.  Thanks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hi how is this game you ask I say good . I am writing this to take up space.I say good bye now.:
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun, addicting, time passing fun. nice game for the kindle fire.  would recommend for anyone looking to pass the time.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|If you want to watch a contagious disease happen in front of your eyes, this is it. Door knobs,  notebooks,  telephones, and all of the other things we use every day are contaminated as we watch.<br /><br />First I just wanted to go wash my hands. Then I felt like I had been exposed to some disease, then...the autopsy event that I wasn't expecting, designed to shock. Is this more than we ever wanted to know about how disease works, or is it educational for some future epidemic? I can't really label it entertainment, maybe a warning. I'm going to go wash my hands again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|There hasn't been any glitches while using this app on my kindle fire. great overall app, I would recommend it!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|pretty fun. It's easy at first,  but gets frustrating as the levels increase. It's still fun to play though. A good way to kill some time.
B004BSFC46|5.0|We ordered these writs rattles for Christmas and I love them. Their colors are prefect for young babies and the wings on the bee make a crinkling sound then they are touched. They can also be thrown in the with the laundry which is a huge plus. Our son loves to nibble on them.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great app! It is fast as the Pc versions. Get it! Bad news is you'll play it for hours.
0525478817|5.0|Let me begin by saying I had very high expectations for this book. John Green is one of my favorite authors and his book Looking for Alaska is one of the best I've ever read. I've waited for TFioS for what seems like forever and I tried not to let myself get my hopes up. But the book completely surpassed every hope and expectation that I had. Bravo, John Green. This is a must read for everyone, regardless of your age or genre preference.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have truely been captivated with the enjoyment of this game. Been playing for hours although the game reminds me of how long I've been playing. each level is more exciting than the last. I enjoy going on facebook to talk with other players and watching some moves on You Tube.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very entertaining. can't put it down. easy to play. time flies by. I would recommend it to anyone. buy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like how you can play each genre and unlock the new games also fun for me and my friends when we have nothing to do

B003O86FMW|5.0|Just had to get on to Book 2 as soon as I finished with Book 1.  Loved Book 2, again, but, just can't help feeling let down in the end....  Bought Book 3 just now and couldn't wait to find out what would happen to Katniss and Peeta!  This trilogy is really something... compelling.  I just have to finish reading the whole set!<br /><br />Loved Katniss and Peeta!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. I play it when I'm in a relax mood. I'm very relaxed when playing. It really comes me down when I'm in the need of some quiet me time.
B004SBX112|5.0|I cant really understand why this only has 3 stars. It is just as fun as the other 2 and no adds is worth a buck.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i enjoy the fact that i can bring and read this anywhere. i really love  it. very eas to download and install.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book, like all of Nicholas Sparks novels touches the heart. I could not put this one down. He continues to be my favorite author.
0525478817|5.0|The fault in Our Stars was one of the most beautiful books I have ever read.  John is such an amazing author, he makes you feel connected to the characters like no other author can.  This was by far his best book.  I recommend this to...everyone.
0545405777|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Like so many other readers, I was not able to put this book down once I picked it up. In fact, I have read the entire trilogy three times in three days now. This is by far my new favorite, Game of Thrones is #2 on my shelf now as much as I love it! I can not WAIT to see how the movie is!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game and so have my children. It's great for those just starting out and more advanced players.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|If a game lasted more than 10 min., this game would crash my phone. And weird stuff happened like my wallpaper choice would change to something else. Sometimes it even turned off my Droid X. I uninstalled.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Outstanding through the entire CD. Beautiful voice! The songs here flow so smoothly and are so well presented that I find it difficult to quit listening. I could listen to this music for hours. Every one of the songs on this CD are keepers. Every last one. No real foot stompers here. Simply soulful angelic and heartfelt delivery of songs that would put you in the mood for sailing or simply sitting around the hearth in a mountain cabin contemplating.   If you want to feel good, smile, and even tear up. This is one CD I can recommend.  Simply outstanding all around.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game! I love it. It's challenging, fun and addictive. Can't say enough good things about it.  Thank you, thank you, and thank you!!
1463514581|4.0|I think I've said this before, but I love mysteries. I cut my reading teeth on the cozies of Agatha Christie -- I have read every single one more times than I or anyone else can count -- and it didn't stop there. After mastering the entire Christie collection, I moved on to the works of P. D. James and her Adam Dalgliesh series, got hooked by Elizabeth Peters and the capers of Amelia Peabody, Vicky Bliss, and Jacqueline Kirby, love the animal antics of Rita Mae Brown's books written with Sneaky Pie Brown, and have shivered through many a Mary Higgins Clark, and in recent years have added Linda Welch's paranormal mysteries to my \\"must have\\" list.<br /><br />While my list is a little less than comprehensive, you get the picture. And now, I must add another to the must have list, and that is the southern mystery of Denise Grover Swank's Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes and her main character, Rose Gardner. As you might be able to tell from my listed reading selections above, I enjoy the characters as much if not more than the mystery aspect. And I'll admit to loving the fluffy grandmotherly Miss Marple more than the efficient, symmetrically-driven Poirot -- although I enjoy both. And with Rose Gardner, Swank gives us a character to root for. Through the book, we get to watch Rose blossom into the woman she wants to become. After being kept firmly under her mother's thumb for twenty-four years, Rose has had enough. She's had enough of the small town of Henryetta pointing their fingers at her until she shrinks into the background, she's had enough of having to hide the person she is inside, and as with all \\"breaking out\\" situations, sometimes it takes a bit of forcefulness to make it happen. And with Rose there is no exception.<br /><br />Only not everyone chooses to break out and start living their life on their own terms at the same time their mother is murdered. And then there's Joe, the cute next-door neighbor, who wants to help her through the situation of being accused of murdering her own mother, but can she trust him? And of course, there is the whole having-seen-your-own-death-in-a-vision thing -- and Rose is never wrong in what she sees. The list is delightful, and yet sometimes bittersweet, and provides the backbone to the story.<br /><br />I don't want to give any spoilers, but will say that Swank gives us a character to identify with and takes us on a ride with more curves and twists than a backwoods mountain trail. I read this on Kindle and it is a rare occurrence, but I purchased it again in print so I can have the author sign it when I see her in person.own mother, but can she trust him?

0312430000|5.0|No matter \\"how expert\\" you are, a checklist can help you improve the outcome. A simple argument, but as the author points out, all to often dismissed by the very \\"experts\\" who usually stand to benefit most from this practice - ego, superstar mentality, and a dozen other factors come into play. Atul Gawande documents his exploration of this subject in the operating rooms around the world, which ultimately led to design and rollout of series of official WHO checklists, which have consequently saved thousands of lives.<br /><br />A well-written book with many examples from various fields: aviation, healthcare, construction, etc. However, let's be careful with misattribution... In a number of examples provided by the author, often the checklist was a catalyst, which surfaced an entirely different and more fundamental observation on how to improve performance. For example, the realization that making a surgical team introduce everyone by name at the beginning of the operation yields a significant boost in performance - that, by itself, is arguably an even more interesting insight.

B006BDHAX0|2.0|fun game but right on the middle of a game it shuts down for no rhyme or reason. Otherwise its a good game to play to waste time.
B004UXUUJE|3.0|Most of this film is in French and it has fixed subtitles that are very good. A small amount of German is also subtitled. Unfortunately the English is not and this is a great irritant. Scott Thomas speaks both French and American English and hops about between the two. As French is dominant one tends to rely on the subtitles and every now and then they are not there and one realises she has just said some words in English. The dialogue is not always 100% clear and one has to fiddle with the volume control and of course if one is hard of hearing part of the dialogue is then missed. This is a stupid and very annoying fault. The UK disc is the same. This disc is not cheap and I suggest a rent as I found this dialogue defect too troublesome to want to watch it again. This is a pity as if they had only thought about this carefully it could have been a much better view.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This takes me back to when I was younger and getting in trouble for spending way too much time at the arcade.  Worth every penny.

0307586901|4.0|The great thing about it is the awesome projects for so many holidays. I loved so many of them, and definitely feel inspired by lots of things in here.  I really liked the pictures and how many holidays are covered. I did not like that the directions and a separate supply list for each project was not provided.  Several people said that many of the supplies that are recommended are expensive, and I agree. However, I think that crafty people in general look for alternatives that are more in their price range, so that wasn't really an issue for me.<br /><br />If you've got a choice between an ebook and the real thing, I definitely say go for the real thing--you are going to want to have this out all year long.
0553386794|5.0|In middle age, I am probably not the intended  audience for this series.  However, I saw the  great  reviews, and decided to try it. What really helps in cases like this, is to  listen to the book on CD.  A skilled reader can make the book come alive.<br />This is the case here.  I was swept into the narrative  by the reader and his many voices.  Concurrently,  I would read the book, to review a part I may have missed, or to get the spelling of a name. (An aside: when I first read  Elizabeth Peters' Egypt series,  my impression that they were arch, precious, or, as the British say, \\"twee\\". Listening to the CDs however, completely changed my mind.) This book has great narrative drive, action  and wonderful  characters.  (My favorites are Jon, Tyrion  and Hodar.) I am now towards the end of Book 2, and plan to finish the entire series.
1594744769|5.0|While attending University, I took an old-school, black-and-white photography class. I learned how to roll and develop my own film, work in the darkroom (one of my favorite parts!) and actually use my camera properly. I enjoyed nearly every single one of our assignments, but there was one that always fascinated me. We were asked to find three old photographs, ones we had no prior knowledge about, and create a story around them. I remember thinking this assignment, if done properly, would make a wonderful idea for a novel. I cannot explain how excited I was when I saw that was exactly what Ransom Riggs did with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. The fact that he executed this idea of found-photographs-turned-fictional-story so well is nothing short of spectacular. I'm not exactly sure I can adequately express how much I love this quirky, wonderful debut novel, but I shall try my best.<br /><br />Jacob grew up listening to Grandpa Portman's magical childhood tales. Abraham Portman had wondrous stories of children who could float, create fire in their hands, had super strength and were invisible. He even had photographs to back them up! But, as Jacob grew older, he realized how silly those stories were. Children can't have special abilities like that. Monsters don't really exist. The photographs were obviously doctored. Grandpa Portman just stretched the truth a bit because - having been a Jewish refugee from Poland during World War II, sent to live at a Children's Home - fantasy was much more appealing than reality. None of this stuff could possibly be real... or could it? When a tragic event happens, Jacob has to sort out whether to believe logic or his Grandfather.<br /><br />Jacob was a witty, strong, well-fleshed out character. He had a great personality, was very likable and absolutely believable. Honestly, I don't know how anyone could resist liking him. Though he was made to believe he had lost his mind after the family tragedy (his family put him in therapy to cope with the trauma), Jacob still searched out answers. When he finds a letter at his Grandpa's home from Miss Peregrine, Jacob decides he is going to figure out, once and for all, what is truth and what is fiction. He talks his father into taking him to the remote island in Wales where his Grandfather grew up. I liked that he was so determined to figure out what was real that he wasn't afraid to go looking for it, even in the creepy old Children's Home. He took action instead of waiting for something to happen and boy was he rewarded. The kid has guts, let me tell you.<br /><br />*Warning: this paragraph contains some spoilers*<br />I was so happy when Jacob discovered that his beloved Grandpa's stories were true, and the children and Miss Peregrine were still alive! And not only were they all alive, they hadn't aged a day since Abe left due to living in a time loop. What an ingenious idea! I fell in love with all of the peculiar children and Miss Peregrine the second I met them. Their abilities and personalities made the story even more wonderful and intriguing. The setting(s) was perfect and very effective to the mood of the novel. In Jacob's time, the Children's Home was creepy and falling into disrepair after a bomb landed on it during the war. In the loop, the Home was a magical place full of laughter and learning; I know I would love to go there! Even the island itself added to the story with it's craggy cliffs and rolling fog. As for the antagonist... well, let's just say that Ransom certainly knows how to write some seriously scary villains!<br /><br />I loved how the author utilized the vintage photographs to create such an amazing tale and fantastic characters. I was a little worried, after looking at the photos on the cover, that I might get too scared to enjoy and finish the book (I don't do well with scary). Although most of the photos really creeped me out and I did get spooked in some parts of the novel, the story and characters captivated my imagination and planted itself deep in my heart. I absolutely adore Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and I recommend it to anyone looking to get swept away in a charming, thrilling and unique read.<br /><br />A favorite quote: \\"I used to dream about escaping my ordinary life, but my life was never ordinary. I had simply failed to notice how extraordinary it was.\\"my heart.

Great book all around. I bought this back in March of '11 for only $7.44 so I'd watch for sales. But it's deffinetly worth even the full price.

B005K0HDGE|1.0|After having boycotted anything by Mr. King for decades, I gave in and decided to buy this one, mainly since I am a fan of the time travel genre.  I read it and as I did, I kept saying now I know why I stopped buying his tripe.  From historical inaccuracies (There was no NFC in 1963 and the Cowboys were never the Texans), to corny lines to end each chapter, this is King being King.  All I want to know is why is he so popular?  His books are overlong, with similar scenes being replayed four, five even six times, it is as if he gets paid by the word.  In addition, and I know it's being hyper critical, but being taken tends me make me petty, why does every character speak in the same voice. Man, woman, child, old, young, doesn't matter, their speech patterns, use of attempted humor, is all the same. Plus, stop being lazy and tell us that so and so looked like Cuban band leader Xavier Cugat, use your writing skills, limited as they are, to describe his face rather rely on the reader to fill in the blanks you won't or can't fill.  The best thing is I bought this for my Kindle, so I won't have to see it on my bookshelf mocking me for being taken for a sucker, again!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It has helped me collect ideas and its convenient to use. I use it instead of notebooks because they get ruined too easily and with Evernote I don't have to worry about erasing.
B0000C0F8W|4.0|All music should be available on vinyl. It's a shame that convenience supersedes quality. But then again there is a lot of \\"music\\" that deserves a swift exit and doesn't deserve to be preserved.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|not worth the buck. just not enough to it. its still fun but gets hard and boring to fast. 20
B0054JZC6E|3.0|what fun of a game this is till you upgrade. sounds so peachy fun Hugh ya NO don't upgrade unless you want to start all over again. :(
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app. keeps me entertained for hours... or atlease unroll my kindle fire dies. Hehe.. deff worth.trying out  l

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very fun. i especially like the hidden rewards. get this game. GET IT GET IT GET IT as a young adult, i love it.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|Yet another app that implements network access without providing something that will benefit the user in exchange. Remind me why I should allow a Missile Command inspired game with no multiplayer access to the Internet.
B003CNQPNS|5.0|I really enjoyed this series, wish there had been more episodes.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that is a Rex Smith fan. He is really cute and funny. Wish he had continued acting a lot more. I have enjoyed him in any role he  has done and he has a fantastic voice. They said he didn't do any singing in this series but I'm sure he sang a song toward the end of episode 7. Chinatown Memories. Can anyone else verify this for me? He has one of those voices that is so unusual.

0198326769|2.0|This book is meant to be a fable, but I'm not sure it's entirely successful. It is written in the voice of Bruno, the 9 year old son of a high-ranking Nazi officer, and that's the part that didn't work for me. Considering the audience and intentions of the author, I can forgive the historical inaccuracies (which I won't detail here, because many others have said it better), but I can't forgive the cute. Boyne gives Bruno a voice, vocabulary, and level of naivety  that is more appropriate for a 6 or 7 year old, and it just doesn't ring true. And maybe I've just read too many Holocaust novels and memoirs, but \\"cute\\" nicknames for Hitler and Auschwitz don't feel right to me. And the ending was so disappointingly expected,  it had no emotional impact on me at all.<br /><br />It just all seemed really forced to me. I feel like the author had a message he wanted to get out -- basically, \\"if you treat others badly, it will come back on you\\" -- and he decided the best way to get attention would be to wrap it in the horrors of the Holocaust. It's a marketing ploy, nothing more. And it worked! Can't fault him for that.<br /><br />I don't think the book is entirely without merit. I think it could be useful in a classroom setting as an introduction to the Holocaust for young children. But only as an introduction, since the book is far from the reality of the situation.<br /><br />There is much better Holocaust literature out there.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, works great with the kindle fire. Really good game, upgrades and lots of strategic choices to make. Great game one of the top app's of the day I've seen.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Back when the cold war was still on, i worked at NASA lab X.  Boss came over one day all hot and bothered. Sweat dripping down his sideburns, smelling like a wet raccoon. He confided: the Soviet has 50 ICBM aimed at us.  I was on the phone with my pregnant wife so I brushed him off. No worry boss, I will create a missile defense game, then everyone who plays it shall know how silly it is to play the nuke game. Well, after 30 years,I can't believe the game is still so popular. My invention was a great success but my intention was an epic failure.
B005HSL626|3.0|I wanted a fun game for my kindle fire, so I got fruit ninjas free! I downloaded fruit ninja, and I thought it would be fun, but it was boring! boring! boring!

B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is super fun. I just downloaded it today and already it is one of the best games I have downloaded.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This book is fabulous!  It took me a bit to get into it, but once I did I couldn't put it down!  Christian Grey is mesmerizing as a hero.  And Ana Steele as a heroine is very relatable (although sometimes I wanted to smack her!).  But the story is every girls dream with a twist:  rich, handsome single man is interested in a girl who is not from his world.  But this man has a dark side, and what a dark side it is.  Truthfully though, I wouldn't mind indulging Mr. Grey.  *grins*  After reading this book, I recommended it to all of my friends who in turn devoured it just as wholeheartedly as I did.  If you are looking for a steamy read with humor, sadness and romance laced in, this is it for you.  Fantastic!
B006JPS1OM|3.0|wellll.....it takes FOREVER to download,but its a super.fun game(: I love mystery games so this game is great for me
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This brings back memories, for sure.  The game its very well put together and the graphics, while perhaps not the most advanced, are still very clean, even on my 10&quot; tablet. I highly recommend it, especially for anyone who remembers the good old original.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved it.,.....best game or games yet so good...I play it everyday now so I recommend. this to people. yep sure do I loved it
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is an excellent movie that we have watched again and again.  It will be a favorite in my collection for years to come.

B005TBN3EU|1.0|turned it off after the 1st hour having not laughed or even chuckled once. what a waste - terrible sequel, and too bad since the first one was so funny!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of games to chose from. Keeps my daughter busy no matter where we are. She enjoys playing them all.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not a whole lot to say here. its cool there are so many games on one app. keeps me busy when I get bored but the games also get boring. this is something to do at the doctors office instead of reading three year old magazines.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Overall this game is okay. I could see it becoming repetitive after awhile, I played the first twelve levels and the screens are all the same, it would be nice if you were defending different cities. The graphics could be improved. The controls work well and it's easy to get a hang of since all you do is tap the spot you want the missile blow up at to launch them. I probably wouldn't buy this game but it's worth trying out as the free app of the day.
B004ZG5F3M|4.0|I shan't attempt an elaboration beyond what is already written. There are few movies in my collection that I would not hesitate to shed. This is not one of them. I love this movie and have owned various releases of it. Now, finally, we have the Blu-Ray version I have waited for. The transfer could have been a little cleaner, but that is probably in the master film. I give it 3.5 stars for that reason. Still, this is the best version we have seen. DTS audio. Subtitles. and good extras. Bravo.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is a pretty fun game very reminiscent of Missile Command for the Atari. It also pulls elements common in tower defense games because you can upgrade your weapons and defenses each round with money earned. I highly recommended this for anyone who loved the arcade classic or tower defense games. if you can grab it while it's free today, I definitely recommended everyone download it and at least give it a try!<br /><br />For the complete Missile Defender review and other game reviews and news, check me out at exm.nr/anthonyortale. I usually do a full review on the free app of the day as well!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its very fun. Because you don't just try to smash pigs and get your eggs back. You have to free birds, and smash monkeys,you even get to smash Nigel up! And not to mention you don't have to play like 90 levels per world, you only have to play 30 levels per world! its worth the 99&cent;
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. Its so much better than carrying a big Bible. I recommend this to everybody. I love the fact u can even take notes.

Critics wrote a lot about how the minimalism was in fact a radical commentary on modern life, and the insinuations were actually fractured political statements, whose very inarticulateness reflected the difficulty of self-expression in the modern world. Godspeed were supposed to be radical. They never sang any lyrics, and they gave few interviews, but this drew yet more attention to oblique slogan-like statements like this one in the liner notes of Lift Your Skinny Fists: \\"We dedicate this stanza to quiet refusals, loud refusals, and sad refusals. We dedicate it to every prisoner in the world.\\" Don't take my word for it: one contemporary review called this album \\"a blistering (albeit politically imprecise) homily on the new world order.\\"  The \\"politically imprecise\\" part of that phrase contradicts the rest of it. Reflecting on this album now, it seems that Godspeed's style is actually safe and cautious, in that it carefully avoids any specific message that might ever ruffle any feathers or inspire any kind of action. If your album is dedicated to every prisoner in the world, it is, in fact, dedicated to no one. Prisoners are in prison for a wide variety of reasons. Furthermore, if someone were thrown in prison unjustly, it would be more helpful to them if their plight were given a clear name, thus giving them a real voice and hope of release.  But let's talk about the music. Nine musicians played on Lift Your Skinny Fists, which suggests numerous contributions and points of view coming together. Yet, the album is surprisingly sparse musically. There are four movements, spread over ninety minutes, and each has one or two simple, repetitive peaks, stretched out to 5-7 minutes each, with long valleys of ambience in between. Take the second half of \\"Static,\\" a long build-up to crescendo, undoubtedly meant to be an emotional focus of the album. It starts out all right, a slow eight-note acoustic rhythm, just complex enough to hold attention. It is strummed with a measured pace, deliberately slowly, suggesting some impending release. The release comes, but it is quite anti-climactic. The same rhythm is picked up by an electric guitar and played louder, then faster, with some drums. The tempo is higher, but there hasn't been any actual development -- the dramatic effect comes from the very simple device of increasing volume and speed. I don't expect virtuosity from modern music, but it is more interesting when multiple musicians play different rhythms and melodies, which then somehow combine and interact. But if the whole orchestra is laboriously grinding out the same thing, that feels like a wasted opportunity.  Despite Godspeed's reputation, this album does not do crescendos well. The production is surprisingly weak and reedy, even compared to the band's own [[ASIN:B000007T2Z first album]]. In the monumental peak of \\"East Hastings,\\" the guitar sounds strong, recalling the dark ferocity of [[ASIN:B000042O1H Joy Division]] on \\"Shadowplay\\" or \\"New Dawn Fades.\\" In \\"Static,\\" though, it sounds thin and high-pitched, and it doesn't help that the guitar line itself is simpler and plainer. With more texture, that feedback at the end of \\"Static\\" might have been more impressive -- [[ASIN:B000GIW9H8 Agalloch's]] \\"The Grain\\" takes a very similar approach, but with layers of crackling, smouldering crust and fuzz atop the dark drone, thus painting a much more compelling apocalyptic soundscape.  The build-up is often better than the climax. \\"Storm\\" begins with a theme for a procession, gentle and almost playful. Between this piece and the next one, there's an opportunity to relax a little and dwell on a meandering, trance-like melody on violin and other instruments. But it's not called \\"Storm\\" for nothing, it has toget louder with more distortion. The only release for this building tension is a long, loud, flat, monotonous drone for almost five minutes. Even here, you can see some effort to ramp up the drama. They add in galloping drums which awkwardly slow down and fall apart in the protracted ending. But the musical lead at the core is inescapably boring. The album doesn't have the chops to sustain the pretension.  There's genuinely good music here, too. If the album could be pared down to 40 minutes, it would be very different. The ending of \\"Storm\\" is arresting: lonely clean keys flicker up from a droning, feedback-laden morass. The last part of \\"Sleep\\" recaptures the light touch from the beginning, with a welcome optimistic tone. The final movement is more fragmented, but has a few inspired moments such as the glockenspiel duet.  In fact, if you were to listen to this album from a randomly chosen starting point, it might sound pretty good, or at least promising. But unfortunately, it's ninety minutes long. The parts that are supposed to bring everything into sharp focus are instead tedious, and a lot of the stuff in between is forgettable. Yes, at different times, you can hear a violin, a French horn, tape loops and musique concrete. But it's hard to remember what exactly they all do, and why they were necessary, and when I try to recall details from the individual movements, the good parts get lost in the tedium.  Maybe I just don't get it, but I tried, and I'm pre-disposed to like dark and foreboding music (e.g. [[ASIN:B00006FSST Agalloch]], [[ASIN:B000088EGP Aphex Twin]], [[ASIN:B000VZSEWA Nine Inch Nails]], or Godspeed's debut). To me, Lift Your Skinny Fists defines and predicts the mistakes of the 2000s. We saw some great albums during that decade, but the general trend was toward extreme minimalism, as if the actual music were but a prelude, a token to be checked off before one got to the really good part, which was the interviews and the lengthy critical interpretations in music blogs.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I liked it. i think its fun having to unlock games because it gives you a goal to accomplish. the games could be better but there still great for passing time when your bored.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Enjoyed it.  Reminiscent of the original.  Thumbs up.  Graphics are what they are but doesn't detract from the fun.  Free makes it better.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy playing the games on this app.  They help me get through my 12 hr shifts. I rdccomend this to anyone that likes strategic games that keep your interest.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evernote is the most useful tool a person can have.  If you are at work, you can use it to create reminders or other types of notes using your desktop or laptop.  Then later on you can access them on your phone or other mobile device.  Evernote is a lifesaver for those who live a busy lifestyle because it allows you to search through all of your notes just by looking up a keyword.  It can also scan your pdfs and find keywords there as well.  The picture taking option is also another great feature that helps if you are trying to compare two different products at two different locations.  The web clipping is also a pretty handy function as well. With these features alone Evernote is a 5star winner in my book.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very surprised at how fun this was once I got the hang of it. And I am sure my family is going to love it too.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, a cool twist on the old classic missile command. Being able to upgrade defense weapons, and make repairs to damaged properties adds a new component to the game. Graphics could be better, but all in all a fun addition to my games catalogue.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|game works great on kindle fire touch controls are responsive. don't underestimate the speed upgrade the later levels are impossible without them.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|any game in tells me I'm perfect after each round is a 5 star app<br /><br /> works perfectly on galaxy s 2<br /><br /> thank you amazon app store for the free app of the day
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Perfect moon tracker. I cannot seem to find the sunset feature mentioned in another review. A+ on moon graphics, and defendently an A on the moon phase controller, as it needs to be able to have the ability to enter in the light % and degrees from Earth. Trust me, ignore the bad reviews.
0439023513|1.0|Most of the books in this genre seem to end up the same way, or so I've noticed in the past few years. The first book starts off decently, there is conflict, relatable characters or at least characters with a certain amount of likability to them. Then the author reaches their final book and it's almost as if they had an entirely different storyline mapped out but then chose the road they thought the fans would like the most.   That being said, Mockingjay felt completely heartless to me. Every character was assassinated in some way - for example, Peeta and the hijacking. Was that really necessary? And if so, couldn't it have been used to demonstrate that Katniss is *not* completely ruthless? That no matter what had been done to Peeta's brain, she would still have loved him instead of plotting to kill him for the last third of the book as some sort of \\"kill or be killed\\" concept that felt really forced?  Now let's look at Gale: In my opinion, he would've been the more mature choice for Katniss before his character was made into something similar to Jacob Black of the Twilight series. Gale was a steady character in Katniss' life, they had a history together and knew each other well. While the story of Peeta was touching, I had rather hoped that Katniss would choose someone who wasn't afraid of change, which is how I thought Peeta was portrayed through the books. Gale was willing to stand and fight against the Capitol even if it meant death. Peeta was only willing to do whatever Katniss wanted to do and even then he seemed scared. The contrived death plot involving Prim was really off for his character, Gale was like Katniss previously - he was willing to sacrifice himself for his family and his sort of extended family (Katniss, Prim, and their mother).  It almost felt as if Katniss was completely missing from this book. As if she had been hijacked instead of Peeta. Where was the Katniss Everdeen that was willing to sacrifice herself to save Prim and Peeta in the last two books? It was like following around a robot. Honestly, it felt as if she had more genuine emotion for the cat than anyone else in this book.   The book itself was hard to follow, with too much war and politics and not nearly enough humanity. Every loss in the book felt numb, like it didn't matter. So Finnick and Prim died, who cares? And considering Katniss sacrificed herself so that Prim would live in the first book, the death scene just made it seem all the more as though Katniss' efforts were all for nothing. All in all, I wish I had skipped this book and perused the fan fiction of it instead.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|I saw this movie last night and I was looking forward to seeing it.  I don't count myself as a fan of Thatcher's politics, but I do admire her as a person.  She had an important role in the fall of the Soviet states and in transforming the American political role in the world.  Therefore, I hoped to enjoy a biographical movie that of course would include much of the usual literary license that is part of the Hollywood operation.  What I got, though, left me empty.  The role of Thatcher was certainly well performed by Streep and there is nothing for me to add from what others have stated and will state.  I'm sure she will obtain another Oscar nomination.  If that is all that interests you in movie going, then enjoy!  But for those of you with more of an intellectual side, I would suggest waiting for the DVD to rent.      The central problem I believe is that the makers wanted to portray the strong, independent woman, but I have to believe that they dislike her politics and they could not allow a movie viewer the opportunity to agree with the conservatism of Thatcher-especially in a presidential election year.  They missed no chance to attach a failure (implied or factual) for any Thatcher success and if that wasn't enough, they portrayed her as a lonely, dementia suffering, old woman for whom time has left behind and for whom the political world has completely forgotten.  Here is what troubled me the most; this is a movie about an important political ally for whom one would be ashamed to show the movie to that person.  Well, one Should be ashamed anyways.    What also troubles me is that Streep has too much say so in her movies at this stage of her career.  She should have stepped in and said, \\"Enough with these hallucinations, let's show more of this woman's actual career!\\"  Too bad she did not.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Seriously the sounds are so grating and abrasive, even at low volumes, that I just had to uninstall. I love Missile Command and all, but there is no way I can play this version, the sounds give me a headache. How can the dev not know that the sound effects are beyond terrible??
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Works perfectly ..... looks simple but it sucks you in..... graphics are simple but clear. They work nice with this type of Arcade retro game.  OUTSTANDING JOB.
0784011710|1.0|You might think that some of the commenters are complaining about letterbox generally, but it isn't so with this dvd.  This movie isn't on the dvd in letterbox, it is in a tiny window in the center of the screen surrounded on all sides by inches of black.  No setting on your player can fix it.  It is virtually unwatchable.  I would have been extremely angry if not for the fact that I got it so cheap it may as well have been free.  As it is I am extremely angry anyway because this film and Meryl Streep's legendary performance in it deserve so much better.  Anxiously awaiting Blu-ray release....
0756656230|4.0|I loved this book about Lego history.  However, I do think that they focused too much on the past 20 years , there seemed to be a lot of attention on Lego's that came out recently and didn't highlight the  sets from the 70's and 80's enough.  I felt like they should have had some more focus on Fabuland, one page just didn't cut it for me.<br />The binding on one of my books is falling apart.  I read the other reviews and no one else complained about this so I guess it must have just been a fluke.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Here are the good things about this book:  1. It has a good pace  2. The descriptions are good  3. The ending takes you by surprise  4. Katniss has a heartwarming devotion to her sister  5. Katniss is a strong independent person who isn't annoying  Here are the bad things about this book:  1. The love triangle. A nice chunk of the book is Katniss saying Peeta or Gale? Gale or Peeta? To the point where it just gets annoying.  2. Alot of the book is just Katniss thinking to herself. A little is enough, too much is too much.  3. The story is pretty much just Survivor add in gruesome violent scenes plus a dash of an annoying love triangle a sprinkle of awkward naked scenes and a pinch of hoplessness through out the book.
0545123291|4.0|I loved the green colored text of this book and the blue colored text of Shiver.  The blue text in Shiver had set the mood for the book, it was absolutely perfect for Shiver, and it just made me feel cold.  The green text was a warmer color and definitely didn't have the cool feeling that the blue did, but I guess that this book takes place in the spring and we were supposed to feel warmer.<br />To get a feeling of what the text looks like, just imagine the darker green shades on the cover and that is the color the text is printed in.<br />If the blue and the green text colors bothered you, you will definitely dislike the next book, Forever.  It is done in red and (I think) was offensive to look at.<br /><br />I treasured some of the lines in this book.  When Grace said \\"It was the feeling of having risked everything to be here with a boy and then realizing that he was exactly what I wanted.  Being a picture and then finding I was really a puzzle piece, once I found the piece that was supposed to fit beside me.\\" It was such a lovely metaphor that made me stop reading for a second and just think about it.<br />Okay, now to the problems with the book.  I felt like the end was unbelievable and characters just stood still and didn't try accomplish anything even though they knew of the looming problems ahead.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|fun and well made for about 15 min.  Doesn't have any game play variety, so isn't really a game that I see myself playing again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Not the best games out there, but entertaining none the less. Download and enjoy, it's free so what is there to lose.
B0031OCY2E|5.0|My co-worked lived this movie and I gave it to him as a birthday present.  He loves it.  Definitely worth the purchase
0525478817|5.0|I've read all of John Green's novels, I've watched almost all of his videos. He is an inspiration.<br />The Fault in Our Stars is a book that should be read, digested and passed on to someone else.<br />I read the book in a 24 hr period, and in a time of my life that I really needed a book like this.<br />My Mother in Law is dying of Hodgkins Lymphoma. I pre-ordered this book before I knew what it was about, and before she was diagnosed. When I realized what the book was about I didn't know if I was going to be able to read the book because I didn't want to reminded of what cancer was doing to her. I read it anyways because I knew that John wouldn't let me down, and he didn't.<br />I then passed it on to my 15 year old nephew because I knew that it would inspire her as it has inspired me to be strong for my mother in law, my husband, and my father in law.<br />READ THIS BOOK. and then pass it along to someone else.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game, works amazing on my kindle fire. It lets you choose between a deal that you're guarantied to win (unless you're horrible at solitaire), and a random deal which is a little more difficult.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|While the complaints on this site about encryption are entirely founded, this is not such a big deal for me.  I mostly use this at home or on private networks that are dually secured (keeping in mind that no security is foolproof).<br /><br />If you are doing any amount of productivity work or anything similar on your computer or laptop, buy this app. I am a full time student online and when I am in the middle of an assignment or discussion, but need to be doing something else too, this app is a life saver. It works with very little lag (though obviously no lag isn't really possible with these kind of things) and the lag is very small compared to comparable apps. This has also been used to complete such tasks as helping other users on my network to troubleshoot problems or assist in tasks without ever leaving my seat. It is very versatile and I look forward to putting it through it's paces and then updating my review.<br /><br />Read the other reviews, they are mostly accurate as to what I've seen personally.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so fun i can play so many fun games. they are so fun i just love it.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I love this game (mahjong) the artifacts makes it interesting also ... the bad part is the strip is corny unless I'm just to early in the game????
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun game. I think every body should have it. it is great for tablets and phones. get this app.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|pretty fun but not sure it will be in a month or so.  we will see.  a lot like the arcade game without the rollerball.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|When I originally purchased my Kindle Fire I didn't think to buy a case for it, thinking that it wasn't necessary. After a week's use though I finally broke down and decided that I did in fact need one, not just for protection, but also for comfort as well. I hemmed and hawed over which cover to purchase; reading reviews and studying design, as well as price I finally decided to spend my money on the Verso Prologue Cover in Tan.<br /><br />I just received the product today, and am over joyed by how well the purchase turned out - as pictures can only give you so much detail. The design is beautiful to say the least, a nice tannish leather articulated by golden etchings. It really makes the product stand out, and gives it the appearance of an old and well crafted binding - despite being made in some factory some where.<br /><br />As I had mentioned, my key reason for looking for a cover was on the purpose of comfort. Holding the Kindle Fire in your hand when moving around can feel awkward, and leave you in a constant worry of accidentally dropping it. I wanted something which could feel like a book, grasping the binding in the palm of my hand, and feeling like I had a good, comfortable grip. This cover accomplished just that, it lays perfectly in your hand as any normal book would, and the faux leather covering provides a decent grip, even with sweaty hands.<br /><br />When it came to putting the Kindle Fire inside of the cover, I had absolutely no problems. I woke up to find the package had been delivered to my house, and even in a half-asleep rushed to get it in there state there were no issues getting it in. Yes, the straps did seem a bit tight, but that's a good thing! It means your Kindle Fire is secure and tight while inside of the cover, with little to no room for it to slip about and get loose.<br /><br />As others have mentioned there is the problem with the cover \\"closing\\" all of the way. I'm under the impression that after time it will become broken into and close flat. In the case that it remains the way it currently is, I plan on taking a leather strap and hot gluing it to the border so that I can have something which will wrap around it.<br /><br />A final note for those who are interested in this product, please be warned that upon opening it you will be over whelmed by an extremely powerful chemical smell. The smell quickly dissipates though, and after a few short hours I can only smell it if I get up close. It did not transfer to my clothes or my fingers, so that's good!<br /><br />For a quick break down:<br /><br />Comfort - 5/5<br />Design (looks) - 5/5<br />Security - 5/5<br />Design (manufacturing) - 4/5<br /><br />*****EDIT*****<br /><br />A quick update - the title says that it doesn't fit the Kindle Fire HD, but this is incorrect. I got a Kindle Fire HD a while back ago, and while the edges of it do protrude out a bit on the side, it does fit very well with the HD and I've had absolutely no problems with it.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|Product came very quickly and in excellent condition. It was a gift so it was very important the movie came just how they said it would.
0545403359|5.0|Finished reading \\"War Horse\\" tonight. OH!!,my gosh,it is FANTASTIC!!!!!! Couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Talk about making you boo-hoo! Had to quit reading one time b/c so many tears, I couldn't read the words. It does have a happy ending (thank goodness!).  hehe  One part of it made me SO Happy, I was clapping the pages of the book together but had to stop that so I could continue to read!  IMHO~~anyone at any age will Love this book.  Geeezzzz~~i want this out on dvd~~like right NOW!!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What a great tool for studying God's word. Want to find a verse fast? Just search a few keywords and you'll be right there. Know the truth and the truth will set you free. Thanks Youversion!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The basis as always is the Missle Command template, but this game goes further with the upgrades and rebuilding capabilities of the buildings and regrowth of trees. The megabombs are a nice twist.  Overall, excellent game.
B001UGIIMA|5.0|This is one of my favorate movies of all time, and I just recently got the blu-ray version, which is solid. The picture quality is very good, although not as good as some of the more recent movies such as Star Trek or Mission Impossible 3. I noticed some inconsistency in the scenes where some are very clear and some were slightly blurry. I would rate it solid 4 out of 5. On the other hand, sound quality is absolutely great with clear dialog and booming bass for action sequences. 5 out of 5 on the sound. All in all, a great film on a great format!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a fun game, especially if your just trying to pass time. I would recommend it to anyone at anytime.
0446573019|1.0|I just didn't like this book that much. The characters were dry, grim and humorless. They just didn't have any entertaining personality quirks or something. So, not that great.
B004ECDNJU|2.0|Found the touch response a little buggy. Or, maybe my fingers just move too slow.  Either way, I found the game more frustrating than fun.
B005Q1W10A|1.0|Once again, I am going to criticize something by Julian Fellowes.  I do wish he would stick to writing scripts like \\"Gosford Park\\"; that fascinating but cynical look at pre World War Two English society.  When someone is that good, it is correct to expect more of them in subsequent efforts.<br /><br />Tennessee Williams said \\"Talent is the ability to get away with something.\\"  Considering the cudos heaped on Season 1 and the 5 stars reviews this season is garnering, Mr. Fellowes or rather Lord Wellington-Soames thanks to Tony Blair, is getting away with \\"creative\\" murder!<br /><br />Rather than cite every inaccuracy, I would point the reader to the books of Juliet Nicolson, a genuine aristocrat, who has written two insightful non-fiction books about the real world that Downton Abbey attempts to portray.  Then there is \\"The Guns of August\\" by Barbara Tuchman.  In the area of fiction there is \\"The Regeneration Trilogy\\" which I highly recommend.  A film \\"Behind The Lines\\" was made from the first in the trilogy and it too is better that D.A.  Then there are other efforts by the BBC and other British companies most of which have been premiered on Masterpiece Theatre. Even the historical mysteries of Rennie Airth and Charles Todd hit the mark more accurately.<br /><br />But the younger generations seem to be content to accept Mr. Fellowes' version of life in England at the start of the last century.  That is a disappointment.  My greatest wish however is that some who see this unsatisfactory effort will be curious enough to read the books I've listed; after all I've only mentioned 6, and explore in even more detail in films and literature what this pivotal period in history was really like.<br /><br />I think we owe it to those who died, who lived with injuries and suffered, who lived with the loss of loved ones to understand what this world was really like.<br /><br />And as for sequels, I'd sooner have seen Mr. Fellowes write a sequel to \\"Gosford Park\\".  One can always hope.<br /><br />POST SCRIPT OF JANUARY 31, 2012:<br /><br />REGARDLESS OF THE VIEWERS WHO CONTINUE TO DISAGREE WITH ME THIS SERIES DOES NOT MEASURE UP AT ALL TO THE BRILLIANCE OF GOSFORD PARK NOR COME CLOSE TO THE BRILLIANCE OF OTHER BBC WRITERS/DIRECTORS/PRODUCERS.<br /><br />POST SCRIPT OF FEBRUARY 2, 2012:<br /><br />GOOD GRIEF!  MY REMARKS CONTINUE TO GARNER CRITICISM.  I REPEAT THE SERIES IS LACKING IN THE BRILLIANCE OF \\"GOSFORD PARK\\".  NOR DOES IT RISE TO THE ABILITIES OF OTHER BBC WRITERS, PRODUCERS, AND DIRECTORS.  IF PEOPLE WISH TO BELIEVE THIS PORTRAYAL IN \\"DOWNTON ABBEY\\" IS HOW LIFE WAS DURING THIS PERIOD, I CANNOT MAKE THEM THINK OTHERWISE NOR MAKE THEM CURIOUS TO EXAMINE OTHER WRITERS' INSIGHTS INTO A VERY IMPORTANT TIME.  A WILLINGNESS TO EMBRACE THIS WEAK PERSPECTIVE, FULL OF FLAWS AND SOAP OPERA, IS TROUBLING.  THE LACK OF INTEREST IN EXPLORING BETTER FILMS AND BOOKS ABOUT THE TIME IS ALSO TROUBLING.<br /><br />Post Script of February 15, 2012<br /><br />For the love of Pete!  For those who continue to feel they must let me know how wrong I am, let me point out that \\"Downton Abbey\\" was a topic of an NPR broadcast on 2/13/12 in the person of Ben Zimmer who delighted in pointing a few glaring misuses of language.  In other words, modern slang which would never have been used in 1916 by servants or their employers.  Once again, I restate this series misses the mark by a mile.  If people wish to believe this is the best thing ever made then standards have certainly slipped in the last decade and a half.  It is interesting to note that in \\"Gosford Park\\" before Julian Fellowes was made a Peer, he pilloried English aristocratic society without any mercy.  In \\"Downton Abbey\\" those same aristocrats, now that he has joined their ranks, are being portrayed as all warm and fuzzy and cozy; right out of a MGM \\"Lassie\\" movie.  The \\"user friendly\\" Earl point of view.  Give me a break!<br /><br />POST SCRIPT of February 20, 2012<br /><br />So now the \\"great epic\\" isover.  Finally.  For those who wrote in support of my views with added views of their own, I do thank you.  For the rest of you, I try to think we all still live in a civilized society where differences should be tolerated and discussed without personal attacks.  The inability to think and talk critically is something missing in today's world and we suffer for it.  As I suffered through the next to last episode or the miracle cure of one character and the convenient death of another.  I now understand the attraction.  Downton Abbey is pure, shameless SOAP OPERA no different from \\"All MY Children\\" and others of it's ilk. But great drama this series is not.  Whether it is the improbable stories throughout or the many errors in dialogue, I am very sorry given Masterpiece Theatre's long tradition of great quality drama and comedy that this series will now join that august body.  Please go watch \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\".  For those who split hairs that the Bellamys were not aristocrats and therefore no comparison is possible, I beg to differ.  Bellamy's wife was the daughter of a Duke and Bellamy himself, not unlike the author of Downton, was made a Lord towards the end of the long series.  Kings visited their home and all the best aristocratic families.  Their ward married a Duke.  The story line is set from the death of Edward VII to the end of the 1920's and included several realistic episodes about World War One and the effects of it's aftermath.  It ran for many years and was accurate in every way possible.  The Downstairs characters were as endearing as those Upstairs.  I urge you all who think D.A. is how it was to watch \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" even if for a second or third time before you once again take exception to my criticisms.  Masterpiece is now supported by a trust of several families.  After this I will wonder what is next for this once incredible and wonderful program and if the trustees are themselves influencing what we are offered.  And given how chummy and user friendly the aristocrats of Downton Abbey were portrayed, I wonder if this series was not also a piece of slick propaganda.  Those of you who follow the ups and downs of English citizens and their government and economy in the last few years will know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />FEBRUARY 26, 2012.  Oh my word.  54 responses and counting. For those who write to support I thank you.  For the others, I stopped reading your reasons, etc. quite some time ago.  Only because you, my naysayers, are so repetitive.  Let me say once more, this series in NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL.  I am beginning to suspect that some of those who disagree with me must be pals of Julian Fellowes.  There are so many others series out there that are so much better.  You really are cheating yourselves of satisfying and rewarding experiences that make you feel good at the same time that the writers and producers, though making fiction, stay true to facts.  Masterpiece Theatre has played some of these.  Two recent Sherlock Holmes efforts.  The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Case of the Silk Stockings.  Perfect in every way and good stories also.  The Lost Prince which is amazingly wonderful.  Cranford and Larkrise To Candleford.  It is possible as these other fiction treatments of England in the Victorian, Edwardian, and Georgian eras prove to stay in character, so to speak, and still capture a modern audience.  Are you listening Julian?  If viewers must embrace this soap opera, Downton Abbey, as the greatest thing, do so. Deprive yourselves of better programs such as I've just suggested.  You are only selling yourselves short.  One additional minor detail only because it keeps coming up in many scenes in both seasons.  What the dickens is an Earl doing sitting at a ladies Edwardian desk?  Accuracy.  Not much.  The actor in both seasons is many times seen sitting at just such a desk.  This would not happen.  Just one of many details that Mr. Fellowes did not research when he decided to write this screenplay.<br /><br />FEBRUARY 27, 2012.  A short update.  I've just been reading two interesting articles.  Anyone intereseted can access them by going to the bbc.com website and entering the name of this series.  I've always been fascinated by how we are viewed by others and what others think of something some of us adore.  Well, Downton Abbey does not sit well with U.K. viewers or critics; not as well as one would think.  Naturally Julian Fellowes says that those who criticize his program are essentially ignorant and jealous.  But in the U.K. the popularity of this program in our country is seen as a cult following.  Not a flattering portrayal.  A cult!  And one of England's most respected historians tears this series to pieces for the very things I've been criticizing since series one premiered.  The complete inaccuracy and the lack of respect or even interest in accuracy when writing historical fiction.  I would not have bothered with this additional post script were it not for finding out that in the U.K. this series holds a very different position.  For those who love this awful series, a third is in the works with Shirley Maclaine playing the mother of the Countess.  Oh god, some of us can, CAN, hardly wait.....and user friendly the aristocrats of Downton Abbey were portrayed, I wonder if this series was not also a piece of slick propaganda.  Those of you who follow the ups and downs of English citizens and their government and economy in the last few years will know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />FEBRUARY 26, 2012.  Oh my word.  54 responses and counting. For those who write to support I thank you.  For the others, I stopped reading your reasons, etc. quite some time ago.  Only because you, my naysayers, are so repetitive.  Let me say once more, this series in NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is super. Very light and yet powerful enough to protect the FIRE. And it fits very well. Almost too well. Its like the FIRE grew its own skin and BAM. It makes holding the FIRE even better. And it was pretty gosh darn nice to hold before with the soft plastic backing. But now...oh yeah...kick it up a notch. Even better with this case. Sometimes I think even if I didn't have the FIRE (which is scary to even imagine), but I think I would still keep the case.

B003TNM2K6|4.0|Wow....If only viewed as a Sci-Fi Horror Movie and it might be considered by a medi-core Monster flick.The special effects are supbar, but this is a character piece and a comment on humanity.Movies like this validate an episodic format;by that I mean,given the constraints of a 90 minute movie it does feel somewhat hamfisted in its character arches.It is a morality play at it's core; not a horror or science fiction movie(I agree with comparisons to a Twilight Epsiode from the 50's).I have not read the book, but having read reviews that comment in regards to the ending not being bound to the written material, I am almost compelled to avoid the book.This movie has one of the most Bat poop crazy turn of events.Do not read reviews beforehand and watch the epilogue and it is one of the few movies that makes you actually question your judgement of the characters decisions as you reflect on the final scenes.The Things in the Mist aren't nearly as scary as people at they're worst.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I thought it was pretty good. game play was smooth. easy controls but sometimes it was not as responsive as I would prefer.
B005FITIGO|5.0|I consider \\"Margin Call\\" a riveting and credible drama about a fateful 24 hours at an investment firm on the eve of the 2008 financial meltdown.<br /><br />What really grabbed me is the quality of both the acting and the script.<br /><br />The cast is composed of nothing but heavy-hitters, and they're all at the top of their game here.  Kevin Spacey, Stanley Tucci, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Paul Bettany, Zachary Quinto, and Simon Baker all turn in brilliant, natural performances.<br /><br />The script was written by the first-time director, whose own father was a long-time Merrill Lynch employee let go during the downturn.<br /><br />The DVD has special features including a director's commentary and a few deleted scenes and a brief making-of featurette.<br /><br />I was struck by the director's comment in the making-of featurette that he tried not to make judgments about the characters in this piece, but I have to assume that the audience will make plenty of judgments about these overpaid and under-principled traders.<br /><br />Take the Spacey character, who isn't the slightest bit nonplussed when he has to lay off half of his staff, but who is reduced to tears when his dog is dying.  As the firm's glamorous but unscrupulous CEO, Jeremy Irons also makes a chilling and effective pitch to keep the Spacey character at the firm after they succeed in selling off their most toxic assets to unsuspecting customers.<br /><br />I also admired a remarkable scene in an elevator when two of the senior partners are talking in code about the events of the day while a cleaning woman stands between them with her cleaning cart, trying to block out their drama with a smile of inoffensive submission on her face.<br /><br />In its quiet and effective way, \\"Margin Call\\" shows what's wrong with our society -- and what's right when an art form shines a light on our greed and corruption.  Highly recommended.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The cover art makes it look like this movie is superficial, however the drama is surprisingly deep and moving, a good reminder of where we have come from and how far we still need to go in caring for one another.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|There are so much written on it so there is no need to give my review on the movie. It is a great film? no, it is a bad film not really. One has to take into consideration what type of film it is its a movie based on a comic book character. So, if you enjoy the movie & lavish fx then its serve its purpose as long it entertain you for 90 minutes.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is one of the best games that I played on the Kindle Fire. Very responsive and challenging. Graphics are very good.
006056251X|4.0|I really liked Evie (what we saw of her) in the previous installments of the Wallflower series, so I was looking forward to her book. Having read it now, I can say it was...nice. A nice addition to the series. Nothing truly spectacular. But enjoyable, and nothing terribly objectionable, either.  Again, I liked the heroine. There's more insight into her character and why she's a wallflower. That her life at home is even more miserable than one had been led to suspect, reading the previous books, and that she's got this deep-seated feeling of being unloved makes her a really sympathetic character. My favorite part of this particular installment is that her progression to being a more confident, strong woman is handled quite well. There is a progression and true character growth, which makes this story engaging.  I had been looking forward to the hero after seeing him first introduced in the previous book - I had been curious to see how he would be redeemed into becoming a romantic hero. However, his character is possibly where the novel fell a little flat to me. I LIKED him, but I never came to LOVE him. In part, I felt his character development was a little rushed and unsatisfying. Particularly after reading the previous installment of this series, I expected for this hero to get an in-depth arc that would show how he progresses from his rakeshell ways to becoming a romantic hero. I didn't really feel like I'd gotten that, when the book was over. I suppose the best way for me to put it without spoiling things would be to say that I could see how being with him caused the heroine to change. I didn't really see how being with HER caused him to grow and change. If anything, I felt that 1) his desire to have sex with her and 2) his new occupation caused a change in him. It was a little unsatisfactory to me in that extent.  For the most part, it's a quick read. There was a section in the middle that I found myself skimming, rather than reading. However, the novel picked up again and pulled me back into the story. It dragged again towards the end, but not so much that it's impossible to get through. I was also a little confused about one scene involving Daisy, the last wallflower. The author seemed to be setting up a different love interest for Daisy in the final book than she used. I had to wonder if she'd intended for Daisy/Cam to be the romantic pairing in the final book but changed her mind after finishing this book. But it's an interesting scene, and I'm looking forward to reading both Cam's and Daisy's stories.  All in all, it was an nice book. I didn't end up loving it as much as I hoped I would, but it was an enjoyable read, for the most part.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun hard easy at the same time and its free 101games in 1 works great on my kindle fire so get it

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is good if you just want to sit back and relax with the family. good for any age
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought these for my brother for Christmas. I never would have paid so much for this type of item, but I was banking on all the positive hype being true. The hype was right. These things are amazing. So amazing that I use them too and will be purchasing a pair for myself soon. Now we look like dorks wearing these headphones inside the house, but for good reason. The new, crisp sounds that you hear and that immerse you from games like Battlefield, Endless Ocean, and Skyrim, or any other favorite game, Dolby Digital supported or not, will breathe new life into your games.<br /><br />Television and movies too are amplified and give you Amazing surround sound and clarity. For a truly awesome experience for all the manly men out there, tune into ESPN or a sports event and wear them in the bathroom  after the morning coffee hits. HEAVEN!! I can be a tech geek when i need to be, but this is not one of those reviews. This review isn't made to note any features or criticizing them. This is just straight to the point, I am a consumer who likes quality and a product that I can honestly say \\"it was worth every penny\\" review.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|This would be a great game except that it shuts down for no  apparent reason in the middle of a game.  Very frustrating!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is just like I remember from the Atari days. very fun and addictive. If you liked it before you will like ut now with the better graphics. enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|You never know what game is coming next. The games are really fun and some are really challenging but not overbearing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|makes reading the Bible fun and handy for cross referencing and parallel reading between different versions. wish there was a commentary option though.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Brings back old memories! Works great on Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket! I've been hooked for hours. Even better than old school game!
0385339585|5.0|Characters that are interesting as is the norm for Grisham but it's really a story about redemption. My favorite Grisham book.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, but the graphics are pretty bad, especially the fonts look ugly. Fortunately, this makes the game no less fun, but it's the reason why I only rated it four stars.
0525478817|5.0|This book is by far my favorite John Green book. It is so wonderfully written! It is funny and touching and has so many great thoughts and quotes. Set aside an full day to read this in one sitting, you will not want to put it down!
B000B5XOY8|5.0|With those words batman leaps off of the roof of a building a vanishes into the night. Batman  arrived in theatres in 1989. Directed by Tim Burton, it was a hit at the time, especially among the fans that wanted a darker telling of  the legend. Previous interpretations tended to be a bit too campy ( the 60's tv show ).  There was some doubt of Michael Keaton, whom as primarily known as a comedic actor.. playing Batman. However, the idea of Jack Nicholson as the Joker seemed to be a selling point for the film, and Warner Brothers just couldn't resist showing the actor in full Joker make up to the world ahead of time. This of course ruined the build up to the Joker's introduction.<br /><br />Batman may not be too impressive as far as effects, but for me this was a fun movie. This felt more like a super hero movie than the Dark Knight. For years this film needed a special edition and never got one. Finally, here it is with bonus features covering everything from filming, costumes, make up, music, it even includes a segment on the comic book origins. Disk one includes full length commentary from Tim Burton. I highly recommend listening to the commentary as well. Some interesting insight on the filming of the movie. With the second disk jam packed with so many extras, at last we have an answer to the Jokers famous question: \\" Where does he get those wonderful toys?\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it is a good app for kids if they like to have fun on apps and I would recommend plants vs zombies or stupid zombies.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|One of the best indicators of the quality of any album is how the songs translate live. My wife and I saw Evanescence just last night in Atlanta, second show of the tour, and out of 19  songs, the bulk of the set list was dominated by the new material, which sounded even better, fuller, richer live. These songs hold up really well, are heavy, and do a fine job of blending Amy's haunting, passionate voice with a very heavy rock sound. Awesome album, and the songs sound magnificent live. I highly recommend this set even for the casual fan and certainly the die-hards.
B006SV2LWA|1.0|This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen.  The cast seemed to be well thought of, but the story line had no connections in it.
B004ULNJIU|1.0|All I can say is this movie stinks.  Statham must need money to star in this gross movie.  I will  research any movie Statham is in from now on.  Please don't buy this movie unless you are a 1 star movie fan
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very addicting, although it has the potential to get kinda boring after about the 30th level. Overall it is a great game.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The is exactly what this game should be. It has multiple levels of difficulty with the options to help you balance your defence to keep playing. In case you didn't notice this is not just an arcade game, you need strategy to beat each level. Great job.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Received my purchase quickly. The price was excellent. Quality of discs were great. Haven't had a problem yet when buying from Amazon.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|[[ASIN:B004MC8CA2 Bible]]<br />  This review is for YouVersion Bible App.<br />.<br />I like to read & compare different versions of the Bible.  This app gives you access to many versions.  It also provides access to the Bible in different languages, such as Spanish, Deutsch, Slavonic, Chinese,etc.  So far what I have checked is all free.  A few of these are available in a talking version.  Some of the versions are already available with the App.  Others, you need to download.  Accessing these different versions are very easy.  Then, you select the book that you want to read, such as Isaiah.  Then you select the chapter & then the verse.  Scroll to read (or listen if available) to end of chapter.  Forward/backward arrows navigate to next chapter.  So far, I have compared KJV & NIV.  They follow my hardcopies correctly.  I am so glad to have something that I can carry with me on my K. Fire in my purse to take out and read when wanted.  No big bulky book to carry.<br /><br />I highly recommend this.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a solid game. Its easy to figure out the controls and get into the game. 99 cents well spent if you can't get it while it is free. Once you get into a game its hard to put down.

0062101897|5.0|Great book. The detail surrounding the movies is excellent. Goes into great depth regarding sets, characters, wardrobe, the actors, you name it! You won't be disappointed as this is an awesome read for both the casual Harry Potter fan and the most dedicated reader of all the books.

B005MW8CUG|5.0|So many newer albums and reissues of old albums unfortunately have suffered as a result of the so-called loudness wars. This is especially true for bands that use loud/quiet dynamics to such great effect, like the Pumpkins. On the recent Nevermind remaster, for example, the beginning, quiet parts of the songs are loud, then when the loud parts kick in, there's no difference in volume at all, taking much of the bite out of certain songs.<br /><br />Thankfully, the new Bob Ludwig-produced Siamese Dream remaster sounds absolutely amazing, especially on a decent stereo. Jimmy Chamberlin's drums have a little more \\"oomph\\" to them, and when Billy's (and James,' if he even played on the album) multi-layered guitars kick into overdrive, it's as devastatingly intense as if the Pumpkins were playing live right in front of you, if not more so. Soma, in particular, has never sounded better, and when Billy's epic solo takes over, it's almost too much to handle.<br /><br />There's plenty of reviews here that talk about how timeless this album is, but I just wanted to alleviate any fears people may be having about the new remaster. Siamese Dream (and Gish) sounds better than ever, and the bonus disc of mostly unreleased material, along with the live DVD, makes the deluxe version well worth spending the extra cash. Tracks like STP, Moleasskiss, and Hello Kitty Kat (different arrangement from the Pisces version) would have been grade-A material for most bands, but for SP, they're just three in a mountain of very good songs deemed \\"not quite a fit\\" for their albums, hence relegated to B-Sides and outtakes collections such as this, Pisces, the Aeroplane box set, and Judas O. The DVD captures a 1993 show at Chicago's Metro Cabaret, and its definitely cool to have a high-quality document showcasing the original band at or near its absolute peak, with some old-school moshing and crowd-surfing thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Overall, whether you're a hardcore SP fan or a casual fan wanting to go deeper than their Greatest Hits, you can't go wrong with either version of this reissue. Now, if Corgan and Ludwig do as good of a job with Mellon Collie as they did with Siamese Dream and Gish, I will be a very happy man indeed. All I know is that, between these reissues and the upcoming new album, it's a good time to be Pumpkins fan.wanting to go deeper than their Greatest Hits, you can't go wrong with either version of this reissue.

0802473156|5.0|I was happily married for 30 years.  Unfortunately, I lost my husband to cancer over a year ago.  As I consider getting back into the dating world, a male friend who went through a really ugly divorce suggested this book.  It explains so much about why marriages fail.  I could never understand why some of my female friends dumped their good husbands.  This book helped me understand it.  The husbands and wives needed different things.  You have to know what makes your partner happy before you can make them happy.  It's that simple.  But we're not always good at explaining what makes us happy, so how can our partner know?  This book explains the 5 different languages of love.  We each have one of these languages that provides us with what we need.  Our partner can be an awesome person, but if he or she isn't providing what we need, it's not going to work.  This book will help you understand your language so you can help your partner and vice versa.  As good as my marriage was, I wish I'd had this book 30+ years ago.  Things could have been even better.
B005DL9O5S|5.0|I haven't listened to much of this set, but what I have has been outstanding considering the price. The music is well played, and the editing is very good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great.  Engaging and kept you hanging on and not wanting to put it down!  You get sucked in to care for some characters unexpectedly.

In its under 4 minute time-span, you will know what you are in for with this 2-CD set, which I think is an essential recording of an essential operatic masterpiece -- Vivaldi in his Italianate style matching the finest of Gluck's Germanic style, both composers being at the pinnacle of their era.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|At this price, the case is a wonderful bargain.  Well made of soft material (no hard sides). Inside has 3 pockets, the middle pocket would be for the camera.  The pictures shown are correct, but the sizes given are NOT correct.  My case measurements are (approximately, in inches):  External:  5.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 (L x W x D)  Middle pocket (for camera):  4.25 x 2.5 x .75  Front pocket :  3 x 2 x .25  The depth will vary depending on what is in the middle pocket.  Front pocket is good for a spare battery and extra memory card.  Back pocket:  4 x 2 x .25 (again the depth will vary).  Great to store a carrying strap or thin item.  I have the Sony TX55, so this case is a little over size for this small camera, but it works and will help to protect the glass touch screen.  Not disappointed that I bought this case.  Keep in mind that it is a soft case and can stretch a little to hold your camera.  Hope these measurements help you.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|I sound like my grandfather yelling at me about how when I had my first Sony Portable Cassette Player. Back in my childhood we didn't have xbox, or playstation. We had the Arcade. It was fun, social, &amp; it was 25&cent; a pop.We just wanted to play a game that was fun. A game that's exciting. I remember one of my favorite games at the Arcade, Missile Command.<br /><br />This game is a beautiful replica of what once was. A game has but one purpose and that is to keep us entertained. To give us a sense of a good time. If it cannot meet that one requirement before all others then then it has failed as a game. Missile Defender, although not.full of &quot;next gen&quot; graphics, or &quot;Live Multi-player&quot; action that todays children enjoy so much, it is still full of hours &amp; hours of fun. Todays generation can learn that we didn't need blood &amp; gore, cursing, or killing with a hundred types of different weapons to get our frustrations out, all we needed was some Missile Command, &amp; speaking of which I'm getting frustrated with this review &amp; &quot;virtual keyboard&quot; so before I hurt my phone, I'm going to play some Missile Defender!
B006GG1KOC|3.0|Some mismatches made no sense whatsoever but still something to do when you're bored. Will keep it for my kids to play.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Yes it's repetitive but very addicting. Good graphics and very smooth. The upgrades give you a reason to keep coming back.
B001D08SK0|1.0|Had to return my box set cause three discs are in the same manner slipped half way into cardboard that leaves a scratch across which makes it impossible to play. Too bad dvd isn't included in the Kind of blue Legacy Edition : i would've skipped the book etc to have the dvd documentary and The sound of Miles Davis film. Disappointed.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|In essence this is an upgraded version of the old arcade game, Missle Command.  It works nicely on a tablet and plays well.  Apart from some upgraded graphics, the ability to rebuild, and 'upgrade' features it is reasonably true to MC.  Unfortunately, it couldn't hold my attention like the original did years ago and I found myself bored after a few levels.

Some of the most harsh reviews are by people who admit they have not read the book but hated the title and hated the very idea of any positive reasons behind the remarkable success of the West. Other negative reviewers claim erroneously that author ignores the ugly aspects of colonialism.  Ironically, this phenomenon of intensely anti-Western Westerners (obliged to abhor Ferguson's book) who deny key virtues in Western civilization is precisely what Ferguson contends is its \\"biggest threat.\\"  I believe, however, that the average reader will find the book thoroughly interesting, pulling together an extraordinary range of history into a coherent whole while making a thoughtful and stimulating series of arguments.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty neat games just hard to get money to buy them without downloading other stuff ... addictive and fun to play
1468161660|5.0|I read the description, and I am a slam poet so I was intrigued.<br /><br />I happened to see it on my Kindle yesterday, got it when it was free and thought would give it a try.<br /><br />The book totally blew me away.<br /><br />Amazing characters, real emotion, excellent writing, real hardship.<br /><br />It's rare that I believe the characters so much in their struggles.<br /><br />Really excellent book, shocked it's a debut novel, I wonder what's next.<br /><br />Excellent for fans of YA, Romance or just a good story.
B005GVA2L0|4.0|I've been a big fan of Evanescence since their debut album and this one's just as good as any I've listened to.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. best in world. I hope they will get more games. but I don't like that u have to unlock all games with points.
0141192410|5.0|I ordered these books for a Christmas gift. I received them promptly--just as described and I AND the recipient of my gift was very well pleased. I thank you!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|my daughter is a huge harry potter fan... when we came across this on amazon for a great price..we had to get it for her..they got it to us in time for christmas...
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|First, remember that this is a movie based on a novel. That means it will not be 100% accurate for the time period of the story. Like all movie fiction, you have to suspend reality for some things in the movie. Once you do this and accept this as entertainment, you should be able to enjoy this flick.  Many people who review this kind of movie spend way too much time analyzing it for historic accuracy. The original author lived through it so at least to her eyes this is historically accurate. However, your eyes may have seen things differently.  The story, while not having a great deal of action, provides sufficient tension to keep your interest. While some of the characters are a bit thin, deep characters are not needed to get the story across. Further there is one scene with a pie that, while not realistic, should bring a good laugh. You will cheer with the good characters by the end of the movie and hiss/boo at the evil characters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is just hella fun to play keeps the boredom outta the way n keeps u wanting to play n keep moven on that's for sure
0393327345|2.0|I have taken a number of fiction writing college courses and read numerous books on how to write saleable fiction, and the Fight Club breaks a number of golden rules I was taught.  First, your protagonist needs to be likeable.  This protagonist is anything but:  He's a disfigured thug, a creator of mayhem, and a restaurant worker who despoils food that is being served to patrons.  As a result, there is not one character in this book to care about.  Secondly, if you repeat something two or three times for comedic effect, that's fine.  Four times is a definite turn-off.  Many statements, most notably the rules of the fight club are repeated over and over again to the point of boredom.  Finally, the reader has to know what is going on.  If the protagonist doesn't even know - he's not sure if he's himself or someone else, whether he's awake or dreaming or maybe even dead - then how are we supposed to know?  I give the book two stars because it kept me reading, hoping that the author would eventually explain all.  No such luck.  At least the book was less than 200 pages.  I have no idea how anyone made a movie, let alone this book, out of this mess.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game and that's all I can say except for it is kinda hard. Getting points is hard but pays off... like what I'm doin right now.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is awesome I used this for earbuds because my sound doesn't work.  This works great I love this app 5 stars works good on the fire
B0054JZC6E|5.0|super cool. lots of fun games and activities. I think its really challenging though. I recommend this game. so glad I got it
B003OFHMKO|5.0|LOVE IT!  I find it to be a wonderful total package of an album, a rarity these days... It is seamless and I can't listen to a song and be content. It just flows together like a river. I'm in awe and can't wait for more from this Artist. ;)
B005XQLBU4|4.0|game fast enough. good for quick games. easy to play for all levels. graphic OK. speed OK good as it is free
0525478817|5.0|This book has been out for less than a week and there are already over 160 5-star reviews for it.  I think that says a lot, don't you?  This book affected me like few others have - I laughed through my tears at parts, and fell in love right along with the characters.  I bought it in the morning, finished it by night, and then spent the rest of the evening emailing everyone I know who loves to read, to buy this book.  Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This app works great on my vizio tablet. I've had it installed for a month now. It shows the moon phase for today or other days that you can pick on the calendar. It also has statistics and sunrise and sunset times.
B0063GORYU|5.0|even though its not the fanciest of games, it is a great app and is very easy to use and play!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I  really enjoyed reading this book. The story encorporates many elements of fantasy, real world events, and meaningful relationships. It provides nice twists and turns to the plot albeit somewhat predictable ones. I still found it a lot of fun and am looking forward to the next book!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|it was good but some kinks so it was good so ya yays ya ya so ok that's it ok
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Bringing a classic game to the touchscreen is great. Highly recommended especially when offered for free. I would pay for this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun mini games. makes the time go by fast. its exciting when.you get enough points to unlock new games
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is amazing it isn't just one game its a bunch it has dart board air hockey soccer bounce every thing
0061537969|3.0|The canine narrator was charming and the extended car racing metaphor held up better than expected, but really, the widower fighting the in-laws for custody plotline was pure Lifetime Movies material.<br /><br />  For what it's worth, I came across a book titled \\"Angus: A Novel\\", which is a memoir narrated by a Jack Russell terrier. The canine narrator had an even better developed \\"dog voice\\" than did Enzo, and the events described by him, and the memories of his puppyhood and the like, were more interesting, dramatic and touching than was the case in \\"The Art of Racing...\\".<br /><br />  So, while this book is certainly an entertaining and sometimes touching effort, if you really liked it you might want to look for \\"Angus\\".
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is not what I expected but it is definitely fun and entertaining.  It is quite interesting trying to open and play all the different games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|There is no reason this game should receive less than 5 stars. First, it's free. It plays very smooth and has several options. You are not bombarded with advertising either. It's a fun game with unlimited replayability.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Fantastic deal at this price for complete Bundy collection! Fast delivery ahead of time, dvds came well packaged in new condition, what more could you want  you are a true Bundy fan, great seller.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I absolutley love this movie. I could watch this movie over, and over, and over again and not get tired of it. I did not think there was any \\"boring\\" parts in this movie, and I love how they make video game refrences.     Now, the movie is about a young man (Scott) in a band called sex bob-omb, who falls in love with a girl(Romona), but soons gets a surprise with the girl. To date her he must defeat her six evil ex's (NOT EX BOYFRIENDS!). This movie will provide you with a great journey of love, an awesome soundtrack with songs that will be stuck in your head for a while, and a feel-good ending. This is one of my favorite movies and I recommend it (espically with the price amazon has for it!)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is really fun.  I used to play the original Missile Command on Atari and I like this game much better.  Definitely with the price!  :-)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great remake of the classic missile command. touchscreen is a great improvement over the trackball. the options to buy in to upgrades of your missile defense systems as well as to rebuild your cities make the game a lot less tedious. enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are easy almost too easy then others are very difficult. my fave is sudoku it id not like other sudoku games try it
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the game happy that can play it on my kindle fire .love that there. Are many version you can play
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good plan. I have tried doing on my own by starting at beginning and reading straight through to the end. Never could make it to the end!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Has a good concept but I am still trying it out. good so far. it cost a lot to unlock new games.-
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and entertaining. I like playing all the games and never had do.much fun on a game like this before.
B0055S348W|2.0|Be aware that this app may not work with Kindle Fire, do not understand why Amazon is selling this for the Kindle Fire.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It is what it is, a touchscreen take on the classic atari era game, and it's fun. But lacks a few things.   The lack of ability to chain explosions detracts a lot for me, but the upgrades add depth that almost makes up for it.   All in all not bad, especially for free. Works just fine on my galaxy s2.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game i love it awesome thing many games too many too count so good awesome cool amazing graphics cool
B001UW58WW|5.0|David Garrett makes beautiful music, using classical and more popular songs.  He does them perfectly, and I am enjoying my CD
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game is the one &quot;defense&quot; game for aneroid I have found that is this fun. its addicting and extremely fun.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|i haven't seen the movie yet but i plan to when i get the chance. what i want to know is, is this movie based on the book by Robin Cook of the same title?
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|This is a situation where I read the book first. I know they can't put everything in a movie but there were some key scenes and secondary characters (and a few plot points) that were altered which probably worked to make the movie shorter, but those were the scenes that got me tearful in the book so I was a bit bummed they left them out. At any rate it's still a good love story, but if you had to choose one, I say read the book. If I hadn't read it I may have liked the movie more but I doubt it. There was so much depth to the novel and that was simply missing here. As far as acting goes, Miley did a great job, but I though Liam was the better actor of the two.
0525478817|5.0|This book is a beautiful, thought-provoking, read. It feels so organic, so pure and spontaneous, and yet, so well placed. This novel puts things into perspective for me, as a reader, as well as takes me on a journey of \\"star-crossed lovers\\" and their turns of fate. The first read-through made me laugh, cry, and then continue to cry, even afterwards, because the connection to the characters is so real. John Green has truly outdone himself. Once again.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|this could be better does not hold the Kindle very well when used as a stand the groove on the doesn't hold the flap 9out of 10 times, it does protect well when closed. The strap that holds the cover closed is starting to fray after only 3 weeks of use.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the 1st level is super hard. the aiplane part is just very complicated. but all the other ones are great.
B005DOL0R0|2.0|I was disappointed to find that the zipper only goes around two sides.  I find that very odd.  I should have looked more carefully but it never occurred to me that it would be made like that.  Other than that, it's fine.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not the greatest of games but, it is a good way to pass some time. Also works well on my Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some are more challenging than other but keeps me entertained and playing, good way to pass time sitting at the airport
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of game options.  easy to pick up on.  kids like it as much as mom.  a few games provide a good challenge.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|well done update of one of my childhood favorite arcade games. missile defense lends itself very well to touch control. I lost almost an hour on the first game. I'll have to be careful or I won't get anyhting else done today.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love this game! it lets you play the game and then get more...an excellent way to show that u need to earn games love it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that you have so many bibles at your fingertips. I installed it on my blackberry, Samsung tablet, and iPod.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love how you have to work for points but once you get them there are so many games to choose from. its exciting and all my friends love playing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the graphics. Controls are decent. colors are bright. Otherwise pretty much what you would expect. nothing to complain about really.
B004ZQRFGM|4.0|This was an \\"amazon suggests\\" item, I had never heard of Anna. I read a few reviews, and gave it a try.  I am very pleased.  Would give it 4 and a half stars if possible.  This is mostly up tempo rocking blues with great quitar playing and a voice with enough edge to grab you but not grate.  She can crank out the licks, which got my attention, but on a relisten- it was the slow work that almost impresses more.  She cn get a great range of feeling out of the strings.  \\"Slide Show\\" with Sony Landreth will get any crowd rocking.   Strong recommendation - buy it!
B0002XV30Q|4.0|The performances of all the concertos were outstanding, and the price was excellent.  However, the sound  could have been better.  The recording was not up to the best standards of EMI.  Not having heard the original full price releases, which sold for about four times the price, I do not know if they sounded the same or if remastering of the later releases was poorly done. Nevertheless, a great way to obtain all of these pieces at a low price.
B0055SWM08|5.0|nicely built game looking forward to more games like this for the kindle fire. fun to play and relaxing. nice visuals and audio.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|mindless entertainment that sucks you in but doesn't keep you up all night trying to beat it. I really enjoyed it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Addicting. Just when I think I have it mastered, I get stuck for awhile on a more challenging puzzle! No glitches.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I couldn't put it down the first time I played it. It keeps you interested. Anybody that likes mystery/crime will like this.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|the best ap I have played in a very long time.. fun x 300.... fun new way to look at missle command ftom the 80's
0545259088|3.0|I really enjoyed reading the Wolves of Mercy Falls series. But for me Forever was a disappointment, I only found certain parts to be interesting. The last 100 pages or so of the book were hard to put down because you want to know what's going to happen. I found that In the end you're left disappointed.Not because you want more, which obviously you do because its a great series, but because you're left with questions.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|so much better with touch pad screen. more challenging AND engaging. kept playing for 30+ min z z z x x z z z z z z z
B000QXDEDG|5.0|I passed this over many times because Of all the blood and gore that I was informed by others that was in it...But once I watched it,this has become one of FAVORITE movies. I have watched it over several times...The theme of one's honor in fighting for what you believe in and believe to be rite to your death instead of bowing down and giving in resonates with me..I LOVE THIS MOVIE...I also LOVE \\"King Author\\" with Clive Owen...Epic adventures about one's honor and fighting to uphold it and do what's rite....
1936719010|4.0|This Steven Pressfield is a little gem that helps us understand about the obstacles that prevent us from doing our life's work and how to overcome them. I love the quote:      A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman.    It is only you and I, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate.     After familiarizing the reader with the enemies and allies of creativity, the book delves into three simple sections:    1. Beginning  The major takeaway here is to start and don't be seduced by \\"research\\". Break your work into three parts: beginning, middle and end. Just like the book itself.    2. Middle  Here the horrifying effects of Resistance is revealed giving the reader a blow-by-blow account of what Resistance is, what it can do to maim our creative work and how to defeat Resistance. Pressfield takes the reader through the process of starting a creative project, coasting along and then hitting the \\"wall\\" which leads the creator to the bellies of hell. However, a guide map on how to get out of hell to the other side and finish the creative work is also provided.    3. End  This is where Resistance hits one last time. The way to slay the dragon is to \\"ship\\" your work to the world.    I have a more detailed summary in mindmap format at [...] which I'm sure you'll enjoy.
B000001EEN|5.0|I probably saw concerts of most great bands in the sixties and seventies including Cream, Blind Faith & Traffic.This is how live music should sound.  With a little distortion and a missed note here and there but live.I do not go to a concert to hear the music exactly like the album.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I will be brief in my review. I have seen other Christian movies and this is by far the best I have seen.  The acting, action scenes, etc were so much better than past movies.  As a dad, I also felt moved and believe this movie will also touch others.  My transformation group and I are now going through the Resolution for Men book based on this movie.  I cannot say enough about the quality behind this movie, both as a Hollywood production but also a movie that actually has a great meaning behind it.  I hope you will find the time to watch it, you will not be disappointed.
B005LNCMIE|5.0|Well, Lou is not, and never has been, everybody's cup of tea; and the majority of the reviews here bear that out. But that's ok, that's a fact of life we Lou fans know and, in fact, love. Like Johnny Thunders: private world.<br />I have only listened to the album once so far, because I listen to LOTS of stuff. But I was quite impressed. Lou's got himself one hell of a backing band here. I bought the first few Metallica albums when they came out, but have since not been a huge fan. They do a great job here though, giving Lou that loud, droning, guitar-driven sound that I'm sure he's dreamed about.<br />I did think the last track was a bit tedious, and I wasn't sure how it fit in with the general theme. I guess I missed that. But aside from that, I was loving the whole thing. I consider it another Lou Reed masterpiece, on a par with Metal Machine Music, Ecstasy, Berlin, Coney Island Baby, Rock 'n' Roll Heart, Sally Can't Dance, the Velvet Underground stuff and a few others which I'm sure I'm leaving out.<br />Again, not for everybody. And that's just fine.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded to the Kindle Fire and it works great. Easy to use and understand the functions. I recommend the download.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app. its hard to get bored with all of the different games to choose from. I wish there were better instructions on some
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome. a must get app. I don't like the part where you have to by games with points. but get it
1451627289|5.0|I love time travel novels, but this one is a page-turner for sure! At a friend's request, Jake goes back to 1958 to be around to save JFK in 1963. Along the way, he saves others, falls in loves, gets beat up and talks with some famous people. I loved it because every time I guessed how it would end, the plot suddenly turns in a different direction. My only regret is that I bought the hardcover - get the Kindle version to save you from carrying around this heavy book!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|what a great port over to touchscreen! some of the old games are. better with a track ball or buttons but not this one! Lot's of fun!
B005MIEJWK|3.0|This is like Arial in that is grows on you. It is somewhat maudlin in parts, causing my mother to mutter \\"oh God, can we listen to something else\\". But having said that, Mum is not nor has she ever been a Kate fan. I have listened to the CD about 5 times now and I think it will become one of my favs.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|I bought  these two movies for my 8 year old granddaughter and watched them with her.  We have both read all the books in the series  and loved them.  I always think the books are better but I thoroughly enjoyed the movies.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|It took me a couple of listens to realize why I love this CD and Florence. Having never had one of her CD's before I was not sure what to expect. If you are in your mid 40's you may remember Siouxsie and the Banshees's? From memory, Florence sounds like Siouxsie Sioux! I am really really happy with this CD
0823016714|5.0|I got Facial Expressions by Mark Simon as a gift for Christmas and let me just say the moment I opened it I was ecstatic! I've checked out this book numerous times from the library so it was about time I had it in my personal collection. The faces in it are evenly lit and wide in variety of angles. There's a range of ethnicity, ages, weights, hairstyles, and of course male and female. It's amazing how one expression can change based on who's doing it. Another great thing is that there's examples of what previous artists have done with the models faces in their own art, so there's paintings, cartoons, and gestural practices laced throughout the book.<br /><br />For animators: you get a nice section on how the mouth looks with different phonemes! always useful!<br /><br />and there's a bonus helpful section on hats/headgear from various angles.<br /><br />Anyways, this is a invaluable tool for illustrators, animators, and artists alike. I would say if your serious about your medium this is a must have. I cant express how much this book is used everyday for my art.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the more and more I play, the mord and mord time goes by! game is s blast and cant wait to keep playing. recommend game to everybody with some time kn their hands.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I can't put it down.  It's even better on the kindle fire!  So much more fun than plain solitaire.  Only problem I ever have is when grabbing cards to move them it's sometimes hard to get the one you want because the cards are so close together.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I love this set! All of the movies are together in one box, which is very handy. The quality is excellent: the color, sound, and picture are all great. The package arrived even before the estimated time of delivery.  It was shipped immediately after I placed my order. Again, love this set!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this type of game but just couldn't find one that kept me playing more than 5 minutes top. Search officially over!! it has it all. depth, controls, longevity but most of all a bunch of fun!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|when I got this game I found it addicting and super fun. I'm stuck on the car game but I still find it really fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app!!! This is the best game I have on my kindle fire!! I don't use anything but this app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game! I play it all the time on my kindle. and my son has it for his nintendo ds and even he loves it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|definitely kills boredom. husband and i are competing to see who can advance fastest. only prob is that bat cave game. i can't master that one at all!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|hellloooo :) this is really cool I really like this thing. it is fun to do. I am just doing this so I can get more points. I'm leaving good bye. :)
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I bought this movie because I saw a clip on youtube called Ms. Minnie's Chocolate Pie. It was hilarious yet thought provoking. I highly recommend this DVD.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I would put sssooo many more stars if I could oh and all of you who gave it less than five stars are losers and have no life this is an amazing game!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|if you like arcade / casual games you will like this app  a lot of games resemble games that the atari 2600 had just with updated graphics
030726999X|4.0|THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO was remarkable. THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE was good enough that I gave it five stars. THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST is both the last book in the trilogy and the least impressive. But it was an okay read, and it ties up dangling threads. Most of the novel is dedicated to that task. Except for one thing. Lisbeth Salander (The Girl) had a twin sister, Camilla, whose story was never elaborated on. It is one that Stieg Larsson took to his grave. (Unless it is told somewhere outside of the trilogy.)<br /><br />The narration continues from where THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE ends. The master investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist finds Lisbeth with a bullet in her head, but he's in time to get her to a helicopter and to a hospital. We meet the surgeon who saves her. Eventually good guys and bad guys from the preceding novels are woven into a labyrinth of intrigue that branches up to the Swedish prime minister. Besides the surgeon, we get other new characters, particularly an athletic babe that Blomkvist falls for.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson's greatest strength is Lisbeth. Another strength is his ability to weave characters and plot elements together logically. But some of this third volume's pages were done carelessly. Specifically I refer to a cavalry-like sequence involving police who race to a restaurant for a rescue. The timing here is way off.<br /><br />I have another reason for knocking off a star in my rating. Too much attention is given to Blomkvist and the athletic babe, Figuerola, and too little attention is given to The Girl. And even when Lisbeth gets a chance to show off her hacking skill, she uses only a Palm handheld. Pathetic!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thanks for bringing the Bible to life.  It's so enjoyable to follow a story through.  The ease of reading prolongs the time spent here.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|a collection of mini games. not a lot of replay value and it takes a while to unlock all games as you move forward.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun game that I recommend to many people across the world. try it opt today and see if you love it
0525478817|5.0|Amazing. Not a book that you can put down easily. John writes it so that you want to read it cover to cover all at once. Best work yet. Even beats LFA and that is saying something.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good variety of games.  My kids really love it.  Great for if you're just sitting in an airport waiting on a flight!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Simple, fast, and easy, this solitaire game is exactly what it should be. I honestly think that this versions couldn't get much better, its the game in the form it should be in.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very reliable and accurate. I like all of the features, especially the 15-day extended forecast. You really get a lot out of a free app!
0486268659|5.0|As a teacher in a school district with limited funds, it is not unusual to find myself forced to use my own money for supplies, etc. Thanks to a great price, the buy three get one free deal, and free, two day shipping, my students were able to read an unabridged version of a timeless classic, and I now have 50 copies to use again for years to come!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun little game, nice use of upgrades and repairs to make things more interesting. Overall, def. worth playing for free.
0525478817|5.0|John Green never disappoints me and this is no exception. I finished this book the day I got it..couldn't put it down for the life of me! Hazel Grace and Augustus are fantastic characters and they have an incredible journey together...you just fall in love with them the second you start reading the book.  It's a great story...although I think I cried the last eight chapters...  To be honest, I would read anything by John Green...even his grocery lists ;)  I also got a nice green signature in my preorder copy!

B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This version's ads is very intruding.  It hooks into the browser so whenever you turn on the kindle and go to the web the ads popup even when you are not using the angry bird game. It takes over your kindle. Don't download it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are very difficult ult ant I think that there should be other ways to get points other than having to put in personal information
014241722X|2.0|I really enjoy John Grisham's adult fiction, and so when I saw he had written some young adult fiction I suggested it to my 12 yo daughter.  We both read this book this weekend, and were quite disappointed.  I should also add that we read the book separately and didn't discuss it until afterwards to find that we both had the same impression - the ending was awful.  The book itself is pretty good.  The characters are engaging and there is an interesting story line and up until the very end, we both really enjoyed it.  But in the last couple of pages, it seemed like Grisham just lost interest and the book fell completely flat.  There were tons of loose threads that really needed to be tied up better.  Their was no real conflict, or twist.  Honestly, he took what could have been a really good story and just made it boring.  It feels like Grisham just got lazy with this book.  That he can send out any slop, and people will buy it because it has his name on it.  But YA fiction is not just milder adult fiction.  If he is not interested in his story, he certainly can't make it interesting to his readers either.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game if you like to unlock new games. the cost to do so gets a little high so it takes a while but still not bad
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Thanks Amazon! I loved Missile Command when I was a kid, but when I recently tried Atari's app, I found Missile Command to be a little less than fun. Missile Defender is a perfect MC ripoff for my Kindle Fire.

B005D0TETA|3.0|I purchased this performance from 1997 (now on blu-ray) because: 1) I love Yes, 2) it was recommended by Sound+Vision magazine as one of the best available concert blu-rays, 3) the on-line reviews were mostly positive, and 4) the price was right.  Although these were all good reasons, I can't say this was a great purchase.  I'll paraphrase the comments of another reviewer: this is another way to enjoy the music of Yes, but it will not produce any new Yes fans.    I buy concert videos mostly to hear well-loved bands 'live', stripped down to their musicianship and performance skills.  So I was pleased to see that Anderson, Bruford, Howe, and White could still deliver the goods with sufficient skill and energy.  There are no examples of poor musicianship or lack of enthusiasm to mar the concert.  I was impressed by the keyboardist Tom Brislin, a fine Rick Wakeman substitute who supported vocals also (is that a real Hammond B3 under his stack of keyboards?).    The audio quality of the recording is also good.  No significant distortion or mixing gaffs to complain about.  I will quibble about a few things though.  Not all instruments were properly mic'd and/or mixed.  For example, White's snare and kick were easily heard, but his highhat and cymbals were not.  Most of the cymbals you hear are from the percussion section of the orchestra.  More quibbles about the mix later.  Video production is mostly in-focus, well-framed, and not overdone.  The occasional animation can detract briefly from enjoying the musical performance, and should not have been included.  It is almost all low resolution; from previous performances maybe?  Fortunately there is very little fast-cut-frenzy found in other performance videos.  Some of the camera cuts to individual musicians in the orchestra during 'solos' are wasted since the instrument is not properly highlighted in the audio mix.    In fact the orchestra is usually mixed too low.  This is supposed to be symphonic Yes, right?  Unfortunately what you do hear of the orchestra does not greatly enhance or embellish these Yes-songs.  As do other reviewers, I feel that the arrangements are more the problem than the mix or orchestra itself.  The arrangements seems uninspired to me.    The European Festival Orchestra consists of all very young artists, almost all of them attractive girls.  The few men (boys) are confined to the brass section.  Not a single musician appears to be older than 21.  I guess this bothers me because there is no explanation for this unusual makeup, and because I tend to be sensitive to reverse discrimination.  I could not find any descriptive info on the EFO, although it does appear to have released other albums (1990).  [I'm sure other readers will correct my poor attitude toward the EFO!]  One major performance disappointment has nothing to do with the band or orchestra.  The final song of any concert should always be a real standout, and Roundabout was selected for that honor.  But please somebody tell me WHY it had to be an \\"orchestra-bogey\\" where the (mostly female) orchestra members come on-stage to shake their booty?  The band members seem truly distracted, and their performance suffered accordingly. (if you want to hear what this last song SHOULD have sounded like, check out the first cut on the CD cited below.)  The disc extras?  The Dreamtime Documentary . . . sorry, I've already forgotten it.  And I'm trying to forget the \\"Don't Go\\" video from their most recent release \\"Magnification\\" (simple, repetitive melody and arrangement).  There is no booklet insert.  One should have been included to provide more background on the orchestra and tour planning.  For Yes fans interested in a truly symphonic treatment of Yes songs, try the 1993 CD \\"Symphonic Music of Yes\\".  It includes that year's incarnation of Yes; Anderson, Howe, Bruford, and Tim Harries, although Anderson sings only on Roundabout.  The English Chamber Orchestra on this CD is arranged and conducted by David Palmer, with recording produced and engineered by Alan Parsons.  The London Community Gospel Choir adds an excellent flavor to several cuts.  Doing without Anderson's vocal removes the familiar feel of the songs, but most  of them stand alone very well on their own merits of melody and arrangement.

B006JPS1OM|5.0|This is a very fun game! Great graphics ans screen play is amazing, some leavels are a little too hard without some indacation how to play
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game plays like a touch-enabled version of a familiar classic early 80s video game, where you take command of a missile outpost and defend your cities from enemy attack.  The visuals are sharp and attractive. Missiles are easy to spot in the sky. Distinctive sound effects aid in play by letting you know what's happening. While the difficulty starts off too slow for my liking, it's a good pace for novice gamers. Don't get too relaxed, the speed and intensity gradually ramps up. After about 20 rounds, even experienced players will find their skills tested. Between rounds, you are given the opportunity to upgrade your weapons with enhancements like increased missile speed or explosion duration.  When all is said and done, it's a fitting tribute to an arcade classic, and a fine action game to have in your pocket.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome game for any age to play. i have aloft of fun playing the different kinds and types of games on here.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I was very unsure if I was going to buy this after it was announced that it had a lot more edits. I still don't understand why Lucas keeps on editing them when he knows the fans are against it. I own the trilogy from 2006 that includes the original theatrical versions of the films, and that set is actually really great, but there are no extra features and the picture quality isn't even as good as a DVD. I held off from getting this until January because I couldn't bear to watch more edits he made to the movie. After viewing the 2004 version of \\"Jedi\\" and seeing Hayden at the end...I never watched that version of the trilogy ever again. After months of thinking I came to the conclusion that Lucas is probably never going to re-release an HD version of the original trilogy again. He just does NOT care what people think. I understand that he wants all 6 films to fit together and look alike, but the fans want the films they grew up with. I have the originals on DVD and I guess I'm alright with that. So I bought in and bought the box. Though there are changes that I absolutely cringe at and CANNOT STAND, the original trilogy looks AMAZING. The picture and sound just is phenomenal. It is the ultimate way to experience Star Wars. The new Yoda in PM is actually way better than the puppet they had that didn't even resemble Yoda. The Ewoks blinking I could care less about that. I actually can't even believe he thought of doing that. The new door at Jabba's palace is another useless change. It just made me go, \\"Wow...it's bigger?\\". Who really cares? The \\"NOOO\\" sequence isn't as bad as people are saying. I don't like it, but I don't hate it. I wish it wasn't there, but whatever. I understand why he wanted it. But for those who think it's the same clip from ep III where Vader says \\"NOOO\\", it is NOT the same. Not as long and not as cheesy. Besides the new edits to the original trilogy, the box has everything that I would want. Remastered prequel trilogy (the films are NOT that great, but if I'm going to watch them at all, it may as well be in HD). The special features are actually great, especially the documentaries on the third disc. The deleted scenes are my favorite part after the docs.. There are some great scenes that I can't believe have never been seen before!   I know people will hate that I gave in and bought this and will say I'm not a real fan and that I have \\"the Lucas Syndrome\\", but I don't really care. I know I'm a fan and I also dislike the changes, but I'm not going to let it ruin this amazing set for me.. Even if you won't watch the original trilogy from this set, for 80 dollars you will still get the 3 prequels in HD, and 3 bonus discs with tons of features. I was almost going to just get the prequel trilogy on blu ray, but that itself is 40 dollars with NO FEATURES. Though this set should have included both versions of the original trilogy, it doesn't and I've come to terms with it. I will still watch the DVD's of the original trilogy more, but this box has so much to offer. All 6 films in 1080 with INCREDIBLE SOUND. Sorry if this gets people mad, but the set is great.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|very bad.... all. of the games were extremely simple and boring it felt like an old atari game even if u liked the games they were hard to use controls and you have to do all this work to get the games unlocked. I would give this a 0 stars if I could

B005NF2UE6|5.0|I was waiting for this new album long time ago. When I heard it for the first time I was very satisfied with the purchase.  It has good songs, specially Lullaby, is my favorite. I am a huge fan of Nickelback and I really recommend this album.
B000002G89|5.0|Almost four years after the tumult of the blues jamming of \\"Layla\\" and a subsequent heroin ordeal, Clapton moves forward to a new world. He gathers a wide range of styles (blues, country, reggae and gospel) and centers his music into a more song-oriented approach. The few originals are of sure-shot quality. There's a profound tension in his spiritual \\"Give Me Strength\\" and playfulness on \\"Get Ready\\", where he's got the love right, and on backup guitarist George Terry's uptempo \\"Mainline Florida\\". The looseness and relaxed feel of this record far outweigh the lack of Guitar God soloing. And man, does he ever have a flawless ear for covers. His voice and dobro are transcendent on the contemplative \\"Please Be With Me\\". His sensual approach to the blues peaks on Robert Johnson's \\"Steady Rolling Man\\". And, if you were wondering, the opening number is a firm indication that the Guitar God still exists. But it's on this album of sustained hope and pleasure that he begins to separate himself from his iconic image.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I love this album. Excellent choice! I like it more than previous album. If you are a big fan of Chris Daughtry you should have this new album.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Although an extreme cinephile, I made a pact with myself when I first bough a Blu Ray player that I would not spend any money trying to replace my old DVDs with new Blu Ray releases of the same films. Over the last year and a half, I have acquired many Blu Rays but stayed faithful to my oath... until now.   I've been an Alien fan for a long time. I bought the Alien Quadrilogy (the old DVD box set of these movies) the day it came out on DVD. But when I saw this set on sale for only $50, I had to jump on board. And though I broke my promise, it was well worth it.  This is quite simply the finest Blu Ray I own. The casing is exquisite, the films look light years better than their DVD counterparts (which already had an outstanding transfer), and the supplements are some of the most comprehensive work ever done on Blu Ray. All of the old supplements from the DVD release are here plus hours of new footage.  If you miss out on this anthology, then you deserve to not be heard when you scream...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some of the games aren't that fun but overrall still a great app and you have to unlock the games.

0736420959|4.0|This is my daughter's favorite book, only because she's in a lion king obsession right now. The illustrations are nice, but there is way too much wording, and the narrative is a bit awkward. I make up the words and she loves the book in that way. But it's a great quality book with beautiful illustrations, so I defnitely recommend it.

B000000OR9|5.0|this was an awesome all star band john sykes on vocals & guitar ex thin lizzy, tony franklin formerly bass player from the firm,carmine appice king kobra  ,the greatest drummer alive today. i bought this on cassete the day it come out it has a real polished led zeppelin metallic sound,which had to be really great to stand up to the grunge movement in seattle, sykes really delivers decent vocals and a does a great job on guitars,franklin brings some of his psychedelic tuba like bass sounds like he did with page & rodgers from the firm & of course carmine appice with his john bonham like skills which was a heck of a drummer too by far bonham and appice are at the top of my list on drummers of my era late sixtys to current bill ward of sabbath next & carmines little brother vinny with that hard agressive old school style this album also has a decent power ballad on it called jelly roll the rest jams hard all i can say is if you liked zeppelin, the firm or king kobra or even sabbath or the harder side of whitesnake and havent heard this you better get this if there was a ten rating on the scale it would be a 13 !!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. At first it was pretty easy, but eventually it got so hard that I couldn't even repair my buildings after a round. I realize that I always give free games 4 or 5 stars, but this game actually deserves it.Good job.

B00664AM5C|3.0|Contagion, directed by Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich, The Limey) and written by Scott Z. Burns (The Informant!), is something of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's a highly interesting film about the outbreak of a global pandemic and how various organizations and individuals respond to it. It has an all-star cast of highly talented actors, it's well researched and intelligently written, and the director manages to follow all of the interweaving sub-stories fairly smoothly. But all of that said, I found that in the end, except for the odd bit here and there, I was never emotionally engaged by it. Which, when you remember that you're witnessing the deaths of about half of the characters you see on the screen, is a strong indication that something important is missing.<br /><br />The best part of the film is in the two opening sequences. In the first sequence, with no real dialogue to speak of, we see a stream of images, of people touching things, of other people then touching those things, then touching themselves, then touching other people, the camera following contact to contact as the viewer is wordlessly shown just how fast and how wide a virus or bacterium could potentially spread. Then, in the second sequence, the story actually begins on Day Two of the outbreak, and we are shown three individuals - a woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) on a plane coming back to Minnesota from a trip, a young Chinese man (Tien You Chui) in Hong Kong going home from work, and a Japanese businessman (Yoshiaki Kobayashi) on a commuter train in Tokyo - all of whom are all coming down with something. And from these three people, the pandemic proceeds to spread. The real thing that makes the viewer stay to the end is the final revelation of the mystery: just where did the virus come from and how were these disparate individuals linked together. Soderbergh accomplishes this in a clever way which, looking back, should have been obvious from the beginning. He starts the story at Day Two, but only at the end does he take us back to Day One where all of the clues we are shown along the way are finally tied together.<br /><br />On a technical level, Contagion is praiseworthy for grounding its medical and biological aspects firmly in actual science and in portraying the various government and international health organizations realistically in terms of how they actually respond to infectious outbreaks. And Contagion is also commendable for showing that not everything goes smoothly, that even in the face of a lethal epidemic, overlapping agencies can be fractious over matters of administrative turf and budget, that commercial considerations can delay critically-needed actions, and that some individuals will take advantage of privilege and power to protect themselves at the expense of others.<br /><br />But for all of its technical accuracy and the clarity of its presentation, Contagion never seems to really connect emotionally. Part of the reason for this failure to connect on an emotional level is that there really are no surprises. Almost every clich&eacute; that tends to pop up in this genre shows up here. The doctor who uses herself as a guinea pig to test the vaccine. The health official who violates ethics by calling to warn his wife to get out of the city before a quarantine is ordered, who in turn ends up telling other people. The scientist who goes against orders and comes up with a vitally needed discovery. The riots that ensue when a pharmacy runs out of a medication. Social order breaking down. About every other character dying at some point. And finally, a cure is found and the world is saved. The end.<br /><br />The other part of why Contagion fails to connect is that, in attempting for a global scope, it spreads itself too thin where its characters are concerned. The ensemble cast is impressive. Gwyneth Paltrow as Beth Emhoff, the first victim we see succumb to the virus. Matt Damon as Mitch, her husband, does a creditable job as a manwho struggles to cope with the fact that his wife was only coughing the day before and then suddenly goes from seizures to death in a hospital the next, and who then goes home and to find that his young son has died as well. Other myriad roles are filled by high caliber actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet, Bryan Cranston, Jennifer Ehle, Chin Han and others. There's also a cameo with TV's ubiquitous health authority Dr. Sanjay Gupta as himself. But all of that acting power ends up largely being wasted because the individual characters are limited in their screen time and character development often ends up being sacrificed to the needs of the plot. Damon, with Anna Jacoby-Heron as his teen-aged daughter, Jory, gets more screen time than most as the film tries to show what ordinary people would be experiencing in this situation, but again the lack of surprises and the been-there-seen-that feel of their scenes works against him.<br /><br />Two particular performances however are worth pointing out. Elliot Gould does a low key but perfect turn as Dr. Ian Sussman, a research scientist who decides to follow his instincts and goes against orders to destroy his samples, resulting in a key breakthrough. In a brief but touching scene, Gould conveys Sussman's weighing the difficulty of his decision just through his facial expression and body language, a masterful performance by a highly underrated actor. And Jude Law's less than scrupulous freelance blog-journalist Alan Krumwiede (a perfect name for his low-life character) fills the role of the film's only real human villain. A brief scene between the two gives the film its best single line: \\"Blogging isn't writing,\\" an exasperated Gould vents at Law, who's been pestering him for information. \\"It's graffiti with punctuation!\\" And in another scene with a pharmaceutical rep, Law gets in the film's other memorable line: \\"It's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey.\\"<br /><br />All in all, Contagion isn't a bad film. It is interesting if you want a believable and fairly accurate portrayal of just how this scenario would likely unfold. But the human element is largely lost in the mix, which robs the film of the emotional impact you instinctively feel a film of this sort should have. Recommended, but adjust your expectations accordingly.wife was only coughing the day before and then suddenly goes from seizures to death in a hospital the next, and who then goes home and to find that his young son has died as well.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|It was pretty good app. The games are kinds corny and have bad quality but are really addictive. Overall, it ass good.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It is what it is, classic middle defender. Starts easy and increases difficulty quickly. Word, word, words, words, and more words.

0062082353|2.0|I have enjoyed reading about the experiences in this book from the training to the missions.  However, the way the book was written is distracting.  I am no English major, but the writing style was total garbage.  I mean, written on a grade school level. Still an interesting read, but whoever actually wrote this needs some help.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun with many different variety of games.  fun for young and old, even my grandma loves it. grandpa not so much
B005XQLBU4|5.0|One of the top  two or three games ever offered FAOTD.  Better than the original - the touch screen turns out to be ideal for targeting missiles, and the upgrades, along with the fact that you can repair your buildings between rounds, adds an extra level of challenge to the game.  Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the basic solitare game, and this one is fun and easy to play and a great time killer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Beware this game is super addictive and will keep you entertained for hours. Doesn't matter if you're. not hand-eye coordinated.
1439170916|5.0|Mukherjee has done a very good job of writing a book about the history and the science of cancer. Although it entertains, it is not just entertainment. It's a very engaging look at how cancer operates and what has made it so difficult to fight. He interjects a few of his own experiences as an oncologist, but for the most part it is a well written book that will help you learn about what drives cancer and the history of the fight against it. Although it touches on many topics as it goes through the history of cancer science, Mukherjee does a good job of organizing the chapters and keeping on focus so you don't lose the point of each chapter. There are some unnecessary, overly florid moments, but it's fairly well written for a doctor.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a great game for screwing around with.... you always have that next game you want to unlock. yet again so much fun
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|whateva dont work on my cruz a a a a a at the a do it rite fish to for to
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great fun brings back memories of the old arcade missile command. Taping on a screen is different than rolling the ball but still Fun.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|this game is taking forever to lad seriuosly hopefully the game is better than this.........,....... its full of stuff like mystery
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|My son received this Lego camera as a gift for Christmas. Before it broke, he really enjoyed playing with it. Its low picture quality was comparable to a cheap old 110 camera. After 2 days, the picture capacity dropped from 80 to 20 pictures. After another day, it could only hold 7 pictures before it reported that its memory was full. And on the fourth day, it wouldn't hold any pictures, though it still turns on. (Yes, I do know how to read the instructions to delete pictures.) Attempts to contact the manufacturer for a replacement by e-mail and telephone have been fruitless. Digital Blue hasn't responded, and a week has passed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game, it is very addicting and very simple concept.. also a bit frustrating when you are attempting to unlock other games.
0062101897|5.0|With not only fantastic stories from the set, but also amazing pictures, this amazingly detailed book is a must have for any Harry Potter fan.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to use. Numerous versions and reading plans are included. Versions can be accessed from the cloud or downloaded to your device.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great app  brings you back to the old days with the updated twist. Enjoy and have fun worth 99 cents. If you like the old missile command you will love this great on phone and tablet.
0525478817|5.0|This is one of those books that I couldn't put down. It is full of laughter and tears and love and pain. A wonderful story from a wonderful author. Read it, you will love it. DFTBA!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Much like the game fed quarters to as a kid but better! This is the kind of game I like, mindless fun to relax my head. I don't like to have to think too hard when I play a game. Only thing I could think of to add would be a super bright, endgame explosion like the original had. Thanks for making this and thanks to Amazon for making it free today.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|its free. not great. you get what you pay for. min min min min min min min mon mon word
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the best app ever .I have tons of games to play.  I never get bord. the best part is that it is free.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|middle defense on a tablet is the way it was intended to be played. this is a fantastic update from what missle defends used to be. simple graphics just like it use to be. simple controls and an increasing difficulty each new level. I love it:) you will too.
B0043GAZYS|1.0|I don't remeber what movie it was, but I saw a trailer for Scott Pilgram before a movie and I thought \\"wow that looks dumb.\\" I didn't see it in theaters because of that. Well after it stoped playing in theaters I was hearing so much about how \\"this is a gamer movie\\" and \\"there's so many video game jokes\\" that I was kicking my self for not seeing it in theaters. So I decided to rent it. As an overview, the trailer was right, it was stupid. For a my more comprehensive review, just google \\"Pokematic Scott Pilgram\\" and it should be the first result. Self promotion aside, let me get to this amazon review.  Let me start out with the story. It was origional, like everyone says. But just because something is origional doesn't mean it's good. Scott is some loser adult who is in a band who's only fan is scott's 10 years younger than him girlfriend, who he dumps for some girl who has 7 evil ex's that he has to fight off. Done properly that might have done well, but it wasn't. It was quite uninteresting.  Now for the video game jokes. I heard about them and got the impression that the movie was full of them. Turns out that the \\"7 best videogame jokes\\" were the \\"only video game jokes\\" in this insult of a movie. I probably wouldn't mention this aspect if it wasn't made such a big deal, but it was. Nintendo Powers did a one page article on the \\"7 best video game jokes\\" in scott pilgram. For a non-videogame adaptation movie to make it into nintendo powers is almost unheard of. It was quite a disapointment that that wasn't explored more with the only videogame stuff to really be in the fight scenes.  And now for the worst aspect of all, Scott Pilgram himself. I think Scott is suposed to have a story of loser becoming awesome, kind of like the premis of spider man. At the begining we're lead to believe that he's a loser geek guy, and maybe root for him to become awesome. Don't get me wrong, he's a loser, but not the kind that we root for. I actually can't help but root against him because he's such a d***.  What could have saved this? If the fight scenes were done in an 8-bit animation style. That would have worked so much better for the crazy fight scenes where the characters score points for every landed blow. But not the story part where all the aunomanapeas from comic books were. All the story aspects should have been done in a motion comic style. It would have worked so well, especially since Scott Pilgram was origionally a manga series.  Bottom line. This movie sucked. Leave it be.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|The first screen I saw let's you know that you can buy more coins/tokens...whatever it uses.  Not what I expected & am disappointed that it wanted money!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is extremely entertaining the app is free and its s great way to pass time in one convinient app.
B004EBZX6W|2.0|I read the online help & everything.  Honestly, this app did nothing for me.  I saw some pretty graphs but that was it.  I saw that my signal is the strongest.  If that is what this app is form fine but other reviews made this out to be a way to boost your signal & I never saw anything like that.  Like I said, I saw some graphs & my signal is strongest.  Not worth my time to download this, even with it taking less than 10 seconds.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game is just like the old missile command. it is fun to play and brings back lots of old memories
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Kindle Fire - I like my apps simple so anything that requires me to create an account is not something I am going to use.  In my opinion, it is too much work for a free app.  I'll find a different Bible app more suited to my needs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|LOL this is fun and some games are easy but some games are hare. but it is still easy to easy to play
B006P4HFH6|2.0|Achkk..You know how when you see enough movies/shows you crave better and better and then average just isn't good enough anymore? It kind of follows the whole \\"ignorance is bliss\\" deal. Like when I was a kid and I could watch The Beastmaster a 100 times and think it was the bomb! Well, those days are dead my friend, and unfortunately, I need good shows and movies to get my fix. Kind of how I can dig on Season 1 Walking Dead but Season 2 is crap. So sorry. American Horror Story just isn't that good..It's not really scary and it's kind of run-of-the-mill-warped; like \\"What you're watching is very disturbing so be disturbed!\\" Mostly pretty predictable really. Scheming characters doesn't equal clever script. It's like a mild horror version of Desperate Housewives (please don't ask me how I know that...). I need Funny Games (German version), I need Sparticus Blood and Sand, I need Bill Murray being Bill Murray, Bring on the Deadwoods and the Band of Brothers. Don't hold back..if you're going to make a show go all out. I need I need gimmie gimmie. Okay I'm done.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. It's so much fun. I rate it five stars. Its one of my favorite games on my kindle.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its ok passes the time by . soccer game can make you angry. I wish the had paperboy on this. frog fame is fun.
B006C45MRE|2.0|First I want to start out saying that the only saving grace for this film were Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig.  Having said that,  the movie is really not worth the price of a movie house admission.  SCI FI at its worst.  The first part of the movie, about an hour or so, it is very slow even though greatly acted out by Ford and Craig.  Nothing is new or refreshing about this movie.  Let's see, the cattle baron rules over an entire western town.......Old stuff from old westerns.  The Aliens themselves,  seem to be taken out of the movie  ALIEN.  So, not much creativity there.  I said it in one of my previous posts,  whatever happened to good movie writers lately in Hollywood?  The plot and the dialogue were really silly at times.  And I also have seen better CG in other SCI FI movies.  Great, if you want to watch it on Netflix or cable, but not worth it the admission fee at the movies.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like this game. it is really fun and mind challenging. however spider can get a little boring at times but normally is very fun and a good brain challenger.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I enjoyed this game. It gradually gets harder, to where you have to make upgrades in order to pass the level. The controls are very simple, just tap to fire!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|had the app for a day or two and so far its kool. some of the games are a little cheesy but for free ot passes the time well.
B0063GORYU|3.0|the ads are very annoying.  I'd rather pay for the app and do without the ads.  Latest version is improved.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this to sync notes and ideas between my kindle fire,iphone and computer. it works nicely. no complaints. I recommend this for anyone who is always creating ideas.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great job on this free app. the ads are not too annoying and I like the competitive aspect of the game
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is a fun game that looks and runs well on the kindle fire. if you like angry birds then you will like this.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Works well with k-fire. Knocked off a star for so-so graphics. Game play is a little tough for big fingers.
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|first off I would like to say that I really like the concept of this app since I have a kindle fire. easily streaming video from a Pc is what all kindle fire owners need. with that being said the video quality for streaming video from a Pc is horrible.when the kindle and Pc are on the same network the video shutters all the time (regardless of the streaming quality setting).   now for the audio... again the kindle and Pc are on the same network. this feature works but navigation is slow especially when compared to Amazons cloud player. also it would be nice to have a shuffle setting at set it appart from Amazons cloud player app.  now the online streaming..... out of the three features this works the best. don't get me wrong it's not perfect either. the ability to watch crackle via the app is nice (since the app is currently not in the amazon market). but again the navigation is slow.  overall I can not recommend this app. its just has to many performance issues to justify the price or any price for that matter. its to bad because this could be a killer app for the kindle fire.
B005RYF5JA|3.0|Like most others here, I saw the show on PBS.  What is their director thinking?  The choice of songs was really off. I am tired of hearing Ave Maria,  not to mention Bridge Over Troubled Waters which I thoroughly hate. I don't want to hear songs that have been over-done by others. They need to be a little more creative about what they sing.  They are Celtic Woman so I prefer they do a predominance of that type of music. Their singing was fine but I was suspicious it was not a live performance.  Their new singer is great and I enjoyed watching her even if a little over-exhuberant. Chloe needs to stop holding her arms out at her sides. She looks unnatural and I was hoping she had stopped doing that pose. Her singing has improved and is lovely. I personally like the addition of the children singing with them and I am assuming it was to add to this particular show since it was lacking in the number of singers. Perhaps they couldn't find women with the availability to do the tour. Unlike others here I liked the step dancing addition.  It was very refreshing to see something added to the show that enhanced the performance. There is no reason they can't have dancers and other things (special guests) for their numbers. As for reviewing the disc itself, I don't intend on buying it because of all these issues.  I hope this next show will have more than two singers with Lisa going on maternity leave. As for the blueray, there are numbers of people still using the older television sets and having blueray will make no difference even if they can play them. I haven't noticed this big significant difference and I have a new tv and possibly blueray is slightly better than DVD but I could care less. I want DVDs and not blueray. Hopefully they will offer that but I don't see the need personally. I've always considered it nothing more than a money making scheme.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I bought the Star Wars blu ray after much hesitation due to the changes Lucas made with the original trilogy. I am not a hardcore Star Wars fan, but rather a casual viewer to the series but I have played all the video games, read a few novels, and of course seen all the movies so I understand the Star Wars universe quite well. Initially when Lucas changed the original trilogy in 2004's DVD release, I was able to live with most of the changes while being irked at them at the same time. I was lucky enough to have purchased the edition with the laserdisc originals. I was watching the series on my brand new LED TV, and decided that I needed to upgrade from DVD to Blu Ray.  First of all, the films to me are easily 5-Stars, but this review is about the overall product that is The Complete Saga on Blu Ray. So right off the bat 1 star is subtracted for the obvious reason that many other reviewers have expressed here, the simple fact that the originals where not included in any form makes the set called \\"The Complete Saga\\" incomplete. Those are the films that I grew up watching and hope to share with my children one day. All the cheesy ness special effects and all, Yes Han shot first and will have always shot first in my eyes. Ewoks can blink- fine, Darth Vaders NOOO in Jedi lessens the emotion rather than just being silent and badass. These have all been discussed in other reviews, but the fact that Lucas has done everything in his power to destroy the old prints is simply wrong and future generations will never see the films as they were originally intended to be shown.  Another star is taken off because of the poor transfer of Episode 1. I happen to have enjoyed Episode 1 despite many fans hating it. I remember the hysteria in 1999 when it was released and it was the first Star Wars film that I saw in theatres and it was an experience I haven't had since with going to the movies in the past decade. So it holds a soft spot for me - Jar Jar and all. The transfer looks terrible with so much DNR and clayface added in, they could have done much better. Episode 1 was the last film of the series to be shot on film (II and III were shot digitally) The originals (IV-VI) were shot on film over 30 years ago and look amazing on Blu Ray so there really isn't any excuse from Lucasfilm they just didn't put the effort in.   Also, I didn't take a star off because with the way crazy Lucas has been acting towards his fans, there might not be another release of the complete series with the originals. I held out pre-ordering because with all the hate of the special editions, I thought like the LOTR series, the originals would eventually be released in high definition. Now the rumor is the 3D box set will be released next of the same blu ray transfers in this set. While all of this is rumor and speculation, I cannot drop another star.  The positive for this box set is that this is the best the series has ever looked and sounded period. With exception of Episode 1 as stated before, the films look and sound fantastic and Lucasfilm overall did do a great job of bringing the films to Blu Ray format. I was glad I bought the Blu Rays instead of just settling for the DVD's because the difference is huge. When the price for this set gets to be manageable, I do recommend purchasing this set. It includes a lot of special features that are well worth it. I respect the fans who are boycotting this set and I feel their pain every time I hear that NOOOO, and hope one day we all can purchase the originals as they were seen in theaters and what I grew up watching on VHS. May The Force Be With You.
B0015DROBO|3.0|For the entire of the book, the author was trying to figure out who the murderer was, and the murderer just showed up himself ... making the end a lot less interesting.<br /><br />But have to say, for the first 50% of the book, it was attractive, appealing that you want to know desperately how the story goes.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|good on kindle and droid charge. works better on larger screens. game eventually becomes imposible.  level 5 upgrade cap reached after second game played.  deveopers should add more depth to game with more upgrades to city strutures rather than just rebuilding.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is awesome-- on my Pc. The app is more limited on the kindle fire, it only copies the url not the entire page, you can attach a photo but only if you have previously downloaded it. Evernote notes you have made on your Pc are of course immediately synced to your app and the evernote universe and are easy to access. Using skitch with it is fine but not exciting in its ability. I would have not discovered all the wonderful note taking, web clipping, url grabbing features of evernote without first discovering it as an app, but it is a bit limited best for viewing your notes not creating them. For grabbing an entire web page, tagging, and making an orderly list to read the page later on your Kindle use ReadItLater. ReadItLater even auto deleted or remembers parts of the page you have already read.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is amazing! I was hesitant about the price, but I'm glad I decided to \\"splurge\\" !!! You definitely get what you pay for with this item. The cover as stated didn't sit flat in the beginning, but within literally a few days it lays perfectly fine. Very very good quality and looks and feels just like leather.
B0014H32MG|4.0|For a prolific writer like Stephen King, he sure knows how to utterly destroy a book before the first page of the story was read! Like an ignorant fool, I read through the intro part of the book and already knew how this book would end! Yes, it is an excellent read, but no matter how engrossed I was in the book, I already knew the ending... sort of takes away from the story! So if you get this, just go straight to the actual story, you will not be disappointed!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This is has got to be the best, most realistic Moon phase app on the market especially the amount of detail and info displayed.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|This used to be one of my favorites, until the majority of the stations are now no longer available.  This is due to the broadcasters not allowing the streams.  While this is not the developers fault, if I can't listen to the stations what is the point?
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I downloaded this when it was free but even at a couple bucks it would be worth it. This is a very polished Missile Command-type game with a few nice upgrades.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|cool to see these old games come back to life. fun just the way it was when I first played it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A great app for taking and synching notes. I use it on my PC, phone and kindle.  Everything is always there waiting for me.  Used it for years and it hes never leg me down.

B0000646UN|5.0|Talvisota [The Winter War], and this movie about it, seem fine examples of the national Finn ideal of SISU. It's hard to define SISU in English -- but maybe \\"Cool Spirit versus any ongoing grim odds\\" -- will at least do for Talvisota. This fine movie presents a quite grimly realistic story of a group of Finns -- who hold-out against the Russians for about 100 days in their Army unit -- \\"They held back the Russian Juggernaut in a frozen Hell!\\" -- as per movie DVD case [front cover bottom]. This movie is the most realistic WW II era war presentation I've seen so far. I was amazed by the accurate production material and settings -- cottage interiors, horse drawn sleighs, old trains, tanks, aircraft, weapons, shots, bombs, tension, grim looks, trench warefare and, most especially, grimly bloody combat -- including hand-to-hand via rifle butts, bayonets, knives, boots, fists and throws. Some may find all of this grimness too much -- I appreciate the realism -- even the injury and nudity in exact context. The Russ have not had an easy history either. Northeast Europe is just not an easy setting and seems to nurture stoic folks. The acting and dialog are spot-on -- not under or over done. There is just a bit of humanity and humor to round-out this singular movie about a singular time. By the way, the Russ tried again a second time during WW II -- making it 42 times [so far] over the long years by some counts. The Finns may say that SISU keeps them going +++
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|Read the book before the movie was released (good grief, I was 10 then! Weird kid), enjoyed the book more but the movie was worthwhile.
B0063IH60K|5.0|No complaints.  Graphics are really good for my Kindle Fire, and I like the interface.  Like the fact that I can change the background and card backs.

B00009RAJI|5.0|Best of the Best!!  It just cannot and does not get any better then this.  No comparison with the junk that is passed for music today. No cookie cutters or auto-tune here. Just real and original MUSIC. These songs still stand up after all these years. Makes you wonder if there would have been Fleetwood Mac if not for Nicks...
0439023513|1.0|I am really at so lost for words.  Spoiler alert?  Your heros let you down.   MORE SPOILER ALERTL!!  Nothing is concluded except that you never ever should have invested in any of the characters, should not have believed they gained any knew knowledge, everyone is as week and as monstrous as they believe they are in the book.   I am spiteful but I cannot believe I have followed this series for up to this point, to find everyone succumb to their weakness- the mom, Gale, Peetah, Haymitch... everyone, especially Katniss.   The series ends heartlessly, with no one standing for anything, no one have saving anyone, just becoming a monster or becoming insane.  At some point in the book, it stopped being a story, just a list of all of the awful things that happen in cold words. It was like the author was lashing out at the audience; it felt like the book was a ploy for hope and just ripped all faith apart. I kept reading thinking Katniss was having a horrible nightmare, that she had been kidnapped and drugged...  You cannot like any of the characters in the end.  I understand that not all stories are meant to end in happiness, but the whole series was building up... character moral.... and just tore it to shreds. Everything the preceding books had earned, was lost.   I don't know how helpful this review is to anyone, but I just really needed to convey how sorely betrayed I felt after finishing this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|An awesome app, many versions and reading plans available.  Get several versions to use offline, highlight verses, make notes, etc.  Great search features, find favorites quickly.  Always have God's Word at your fingertips!

B006GG1KOC|1.0|I thought it was STUPID! on the other hand it was hard and silly. I hated the game. it was horrible
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great interactive game that really keeps your fingers moving.  Had fun with all the upgrades you can buy. Wished the player had more missiles to choose from.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Lady Antebelum is surprising in the range of vocals and variety of lyrics.  It is hard to believe that there are only 3 members in the group.  You can tell they are moved by the music and sing from the heart.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is entertaining and challenging! I Love it! It seems like a Great app so far!  I will be wasting a lot of time playing this!
B003UMW68Y|4.0|Great movie for children and adults. A classic that belongs in any movie collection. Looks 10x's better on bluray then regular dvd. Amazing clarity.
B0043X1FOK|5.0|My sons (8 & 11) had seen the first film a few years back and wanted to see it again. So for Christmas, we got both Short Circuit and Short Circuit 2. They LOVED both films. Funny and heartfelt, it works for the whole family. Number Five is definitely ALIVE!
B0055SWM08|5.0|excellent game, very addicting!  I sat up until 4AM 3 nights in a row playing..I would def recommend  to all!
B003Y5H53S|1.0|WOW, what a terriable movie, I'm glad I rented it first and am now saving the money of buying it.   I am a Johnny Depp fan, but was so disappointed with this movie...   The animation was very good in this movie, but what good is that if you can't stand to watch the thing!  Just when you think it is going to get better it don't and never does.  It's kind of sad, because if it was written better it might have been a real hit...  If you listen to nothing else of my review, rent it first!   Then you will know exactly what you are buying...
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Missile Defender fans will enjoy this modern take on the classic arcade game. The addition of the power-ups really add an element of strategy. My only complaint would be that it gets HARD after level 30. Perfect for Android tablets!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a number of standard issue flash games but there's a twist.... you have to play them to earn more games.  I love it!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I enjoy reading God's Word when I want to in this handy way.  My biggest concern with this app is that it needs Internet.  If I need Internet anyway, I can just read online.  I am trying to figure out if there's a way to use this app offline.

0385508476|5.0|I bought this book because I didn't want the Anne Frank I had come to know in a previous, far shorter book - to stop talking to me. I hoped that she had more to say.<br /><br />It really is strange how someone can capture your imagination, so many years after they are gone. In these pages, Anne Frank still lives. And despite having THREE different versions - right next to each other - it becomes obvious that the same person is clearly the author of all three.<br /><br />I have become aware of those who think that the entire Anne Frank story is a forgery. While there is absolutely no way of being 100 percent sure of ANYTHING nowadays - with neither the Press or, mainstream media having any moral compunction about manufacturing stories for propaganda and profit - it is hard to imagine why anyone would want to do so for this document.<br /><br />If anything, it is a stark reminder of how badly, propaganda can be used to lie to the populace, and of how twisted the truth can become. And it takes a 13 year-old girl to see through the lies with which grown-ups become accustomed to. And as she grows older, with each page written - you see her slowly shying away from what would otherwise have been fair game for commentary. No piece of fiction, no matter how well written has ever been able to capture this transition. Anne Frank, seems incapable of hiding her growing maturity. And that frustration shows in her later writing.<br /><br />I have never stopped wondering about the person she would have grown into - had she lived. But then, if she had any say - she may well have decided against publishing, what became - clearly - a private document - into which she poured her soul.
0446569895|5.0|I read the first 200 pages in just one night. Its hilarious and looks at Ozzy's experiances on the road with Sabbath and his solo career. He said himself though that not all of it can be true. Some parts he doesn't remember but he is relying on other people's stories of what happend. Even that, it is still a great read.   Deffinatly reccomend this to any Ozzy/Sabbath fan.  Ps. There is a typo in the back (Instead of \\"Iommi\\" they put \\"Ionni\\" in the back after the book)
0802130208|5.0|\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" will never be loved by the masses. Satire is a close cousin to sarcasm, and as any practicer of sarcasm will tell you - not everyone gets it. Dennis Miller is either a genius or an idiot depending on the listeners in the audience. That is the best way to describe, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" - you will either love it or hate.... probably not too much in between.<br /><br />Ignatius Reilly may be the most colorful character written in the 20th century. He is rude, oddly intelligent on obscure ways, racist, narcissistic, and completely insane. He combines every bad mannered characteristic that you have encountered. You are supposed to both hate and pity his pathetic existence. This is the genius of John Kennedy Toole - he has created a character that is larger than life and has illuminated the insanity of his narcissistic ramblings.<br /><br />I am not sure ow to explain the writing style - it can be difficult to follow. At times Toole changes perspective from paragraph to paragraph and intermingles the characters thoughts almost randomly. The prose is vey strong, but \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" was a slow read for me. it is difficult to explain it, but the style is similar to Faulkner - and it certainly is not everyone.<br /><br />Many people compare \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" to [[ASIN:1613821484 Don Quixote]] but to me it reminds me more of [[ASIN:1936041774 A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]. All three combine ridiculous scenes, and some not-so-subtle social commentary. However, Toole is able to match the wit of Twain but is able to elevate the style of writing. One of the criticisms of Twain was that he wrote children's books (an unfair criticism in my view). Make no mistake - Toole has written a book for adults (and parts are rather vulgar).<br /><br />Final Verdict - It really is a shame that Toole only left us this one work - perhaps he would have never been able to match \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" but it would have been interesting to have seen how he progressed as a writer.<br /><br />5 Starsa writer.   5 Stars
B002RL7W9W|5.0|Hey guys this is Deal Hunter with my 3rd review and for this review im going review the lego star wars snow trooper army pack. They made this set for the 30th anniversary, which is awsome because this set is just perfect if you are building a imperial army.This comes with some new printed mini figures, classic snow trooper,imperial officer,snow speeder, and a turrent.For the ratings for kids i give this a 10.For teens i give this a 8.And for adults I give this a 10 because this might bring back old times.I highly recommend getting this set if you are getting a set.It is a must have for all collectors so this set that will increase in value.Let me know if this helped you -Deal Hunter
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Fun little ghost story.  Great sound track.  A little pedestrian for the 21st century, but I remember it new in '86.  Can you really not like a movie with a Steve Vai cameo?  Ordered a used copy and got it in great shape, and in four days, two weeks before Christmas.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|Received my blu ray in good packaging and on time.I love the movie and Amazon. No complaints. Good deal. Prime rocks!

B001EIOOV8|5.0|Casino is not only an amazing movie, but gives a great look into the Las Vegas mob scene. The Blue-ray is a great investment for this film because of length as well as the cinematography.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very good game, highly recommended.  Fun to play and figure out.  Just like old missle command from Atari with much better graphics.
B002UOMGVU|5.0|You can't go wrong with GoodFellas, great movie and the blue ray makes it even better. The extras are nice to have when you want a little more history about what inspired the movie and it will be enjoyed thoroughly.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I'm not much into games but this was very easy to get the hang of. Fast play but I felt I was doing pretty good right away.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|This game doesn't require reading, but kids really have to think to see why one is different.  My kids are entertained.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|yay this game is very fun and I am oh so very glad and happy that I decided. to by it u should to
B001E45XT4|4.0|Comfortable, even with my glasses on! Well, not quite. It's really not made for people with glasses, but luckily the cushioning is so soft and the quality so high that the VERY SLIGHT discomfort was ignorable.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|My daughter and I are huge fans. The dvd is fantastic. It is lovely to see movies that do justice to a wonderful book.  Cheers,  Michelle
B004EPYZT4|2.0|If you are a fan of the books like I am then you might want to see it just to see it. Otherwise it's not worth watching. The special effects are good but Momoa is a terrible Conan. How much does he weigh? 180 lbs.? Hardly fit to be a Cimmerian. And he's not a good actor either.   The plot needed more depth and overall it was a complete departure from the books, and that's unfortunate because the books would make a good movie if they stuck to one of the stories. Marique the Sorceress (Rose McGowan) is the only reason I didn't give this movie one star. She played the best role. Other than that this movie was a waste of 112 mins, and an even bigger waste to those who produced it, as it flopped.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|me and my son love to play these fun family games.. he can even playthem on his own in car.
B004Q7E0TA|3.0|This book floored me, left me charged, heartbroken, renewed and devastated. In a nutshell, this book is a memoir of Portia De Rossi's struggle with anorexia, fame and her own sexuality, and the overwhelming need not only to fit in, but to be seen as a \\"normal\\" person in Hollywood.<br /><br />I loved this one. I couldn't put it down. It was completely heartbreaking and inspiring and so many things. I've been a fan of Portia de Rossi since I saw her on Arrested Development (I was in middle school when she was in the midst of Ally McBeal). So when I found out that she was writing about her life I was very excited. However, I was not expecting a novel of this caliber.<br /><br />I've never had an eating disorder but I'm sure we've all read a YA title of two that deals with one. (Just Listen by Sarah Dessen and Wintergirls by Laurie Halse Anderson come to mind. Great reads, btw). But to read a YA title is vastly different from reading about it someone's memoir.<br /><br />There are several parts of the novel that just break my heart. At one point she was consuming just 300 calories a day because she was terrified of being a size 8. Some women DREAM of being a size eight. My heart broke for her when she described the cycles of binges and not eating and too much exercise. Near the middle of the novel she begins to think that maybe she really is TOO THIN and people start commenting on how great she looks.<br /><br />I really hate that as a society we put more importance on looks rather than who a person really is. (In a lot of cases). I think one thing that this novel taught me is that it's better to try to be healthy and be who you're naturally supposed to be (rounder thighs and all) than to make yourself miserable and sick because someone thinks that being skeletal is hotter.<br /><br />This memoir will stick with me for a very long time. I'll definitely be counting my blessings. I'm happy, I'm healthy, my boyfriend loves me very much, in spite of my imperfections, and I love myself. I really am blessed. This memoir has changed my life for the better.changed my life for the better.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It gives me the fun I want. I enjoy this game because it is simple, enjoyable, and it makes you waste time. I would have paid for this because of the fun it gives me. I suggest this for anyone looking for something to waste time with. I also suggest it for anyone who enjoys these kinds of games.
014241543X|5.0|I started this book yesterday and by the time I was halfway through, not only was I tearing up, I mentioned to Jaime of The Perpetual Pageturner and The Broke and Bookish that I was certain that I was going to be haunted by this book for a very long time, no matter how the book ended. This morning I put the book down because I was crying on the kitchen floor, ten pages from the end. TEN PAGES. I even emailed my boyfriend to tell him about it. Finally, this evening I read the last ten pages. My first comment? \\"I have no words.\\" I have cried over quite a few books in my time, but I was sobbing over this one. It was so intense.<br /><br />I loved the family in this book. I think that's one of the things that will haunt me. The parents were unconventional, but loved their children dearly and were raising them to be true to not only themselves, but to pursue the things that made them happy. The grandparents are more traditional, but just as wonderful. It was a moment with the grandfather that started the tears for me as well.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away any of the plot, because I want you all to go into it kind of blankly (if you can) because I did and it was so worth it. I will say that if you're even remotely thinking about this book, DO IT! DO IT NOW!!!<br /><br />I really truly don't think that I've read a book like this before. I was so deeply moved. The pacing of the novel was a little jumbled, which usually turns me off, but with If I Stay, it really seemed to work. The novel is divided by segments of time. Part of the novel is what's happening in the moment, and the other part is flashbacks interspersed throughout the novel that show events leading up to what's happening in real time. You learn so much about the characters in each format so it was a wonderfully used technique.<br /><br />The sequel Where She Went comes out in a few days. I'm going to buy it the day of it's release, but I may need a few additional days to recover before diving into the sequel. I'm not sure my emotions could take it. But I NEED to know what happens!!ke it. But I NEED to know what happens!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am in middle school and love these books. I'm usually not a big reader but I found my self up at 2 in the morning trying to find out what's going to happen next. These books made me laugh and cry. I am now hooked on these books and cant wait for the movie to come. I would recommend this to anyone who loves action, suspense, and love story's. In other words GREAT BOOKS.
0142419400|5.0|The basic synopsis is that Anna's family decides that she should spend her senior year in an American boarding school in Paris. (She's from Atlanta). She doesn't really want to go, she'd be leaving her little brother, her best friend and a boy that she has kind of a pseudo relationship with. Once she arrives in Paris she makes some friends, one of whom is Etienne St. Clair who has a girlfriend. (Don't they always?) They become really great friends and then things naturally get complicated. And all this I learned from the book flaps!<br />There are mini reviews on the back cover, one of which says that \\"you'll want to date this book.\\" It's true. I do.<br />I LOVED this book. And not just because it's set in Paris. I could completely relate to Anna. She was funny and witty and smart, yet she had no idea what the guys she liked were thinking or why they do the things that they do. What girl can't relate to that? I was happy for her in all the good parts, I was heartbroken with her in the sad parts, I even slightly pined for Etienne myself. This book is so charming. I wanted to crawl inside it and live in the pages. I even read a couple parts to Matt who played the part of attentive boyfriend and listened patiently with an almost non-judgmental look on his face. He and I both want to go to Paris someday so I read him the parts of the characters out and about.<br />One of my favorite parts of the book was that it was so real. The relationships were realistic, the minor characters, particularly in Paris are so unique. I've read a lot of lighter novels were it's just so unrealistic that it's irritating. This book makes me want to update my passport, pack my bags and head to the star in front of the Notre Dame and then head to the nearest wine bar. I'm not going to lie, the fact that there are wine bars is a HUGE contributing factor. Let's face it, even crappy French wine (if such a thing exists) is going to be infinitely better than anything I have in my fridge.<br />The format of the book is great as well. I could put the book down at the end of any chapter and feel excited about what was coming up rather than feel like I was in a bad stopping place.k is great as well.

0439023521|4.0|I was very hesitant to read this book originally, due to all the hype. I didn't know anything about the book, but hype tends to scare me off. I waited until just before the last book was released to read the Harry Potter series, so it's nothing new.  However, after having the series recommended to me from several lovely bookish people that I adore and respect, I decided to give it a go. I had to reserve the book at the library; it's that popular. While I was waiting for the book to come in, I kept trying not to talk myself out of reading it.<br /><br />I'm very glad I didn't. I started it Saturday night and only put it down because I was falling asleep. I spent all day Sunday finishing it. This book is amazing. I'm a fan of dystopian novels, and having read several I can proudly say that this one is very near the top of the list.<br /><br />I can't even begin to state what I love the most about the book. The characters are amazing, the plot is intense. You laugh, you cry, you cringe; it has everything. I'm a hopeless romantic, so the whole storyline about the are-they-or-aren't-they love story between Katniss and Peeta, pulled at my heartstrings for a good 200 pages. But then there's always that monkey wrench thrown in at the end of a book in a trilogy isn't there?<br /><br />I really liked that even though a common themes in novels like The Hunger Games is that life is terrible unless you're part of the elite, it was told in a new way. There is no Big Brother storyline better than in the Hunger Games Arena. Normally, I'm a little depressed when I finish one of these novels, but I was elated and almost satisfied, (in an \\"I Knew It\\" kind of way). I can't wait to keep reading the series and find out what happens to the characters now. Once I stop kicking myself for waiting so long to read the book. Perhaps the next time I book is hyped, I should just give in.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this is a good time waster.  There are many good games, but I just think that it should be a bit easier to buy the games. Overall this is a good game for the price.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminded me of being a kid playing this console game at the arcade.  good graphics, but typically you play until you fail, which is my least favorite sort of game...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. I play it every day when I'm on my kindle after I got it lt. I love this game
B003XCVQ3C|2.0|Awesome at first. But after the honeymoon period, it just starts cutting out intermittently.

B0064NTZJO|1.0|Im sorry this movie was garbage,  the getaway in the begining was ok after that the film went downhill. it just got boring, there was to many beaks in the storyline, there where just two many scenes where the actors where just stairing at eachother for no reason.  i saw this in the movie theatre when it came out, by the time the movie ending half of the movie theatre had left so im kinda comfused why all the reviews for this movie where good,  this was a waste of time and money.  dont waste your life watching this,  TRUST ME

B0054JZC6E|3.0|after a while the games in the game are too pricey. some of the games are hard to beat also.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I'll be honest; I had my doubts about this game, but as soon as tapped that launch button I was immediatley hooked! Didn't even know I was playing for hours!  I got the game for free, but I would have definitely paid for it.

B0059XTTW8|5.0|Gary Oldman crowns himself king of the pregnant pause in the film version of John le Carre's \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.\\" Mass democracy, better grasped as government by talk, obscures the truth taught by Rabbi Avigdor Miller of blessed memory - \\"It is the quiet man that is respected.\\" There is a Soviet mole in the British intelligence service (\\"The Circus\\") but somehow we just know it's not George Smiley (played by Oldman). Too much gravitas. Smiley earns his gravitas by saying little and doing much (Shammai. Pirkei Avos 1:15). Thank you, Mr. Oldman, for proving the rebbe correct.   \\"Tinker, Tailor\\" is full of the ambiguity and dead-pan humor that le Carre has been gifting to readers for nearly three generations (2013 will mark the 50th anniversary of \\"The Spy That Came in From the Cold\\"). The author being one of the film's executive producers guarantees full injection of the book's best touches. Bureaucracy and camaraderie prove useful devices. The humor even registers in the names - Control (played strongly by John Hurt) is losing control of The Circus and Smiley doesn't smile. Le Carre uses an Anton Chekov-type pen in showing that Control and Smiley have hurt themselves as much as been hurt by others (Control with his inner circle, Smiley with his wife). Fittingly, they're run out of The Circus at the same time.   Having had his one illusion shattered through Ann's infidelity, Smiley is the best equipped to find the mole. Swimming in the brackish water without removing his glasses is wonderful metaphor for Smiley's abilities and realism.   Smiley's recollection of Karla is another compelling dive into realism. With the help of some drink, he concedes the brilliance of his adversary in noting that Karla carries a non-memorable face, a great asset in the spy game. Smiley admits Karla has a piece of him through possession of a cigarette lighter (\\"For George. Love, Ann\\"), hinting that Smiley's work nudged Ann toward infidelity. As viewers inhale deep thinking Smiley might be the mole, our hero quickly exhales for us in proclaiming Karla can be beaten because he's a fanatic. By extension, le Carre is saying an ideology state cannot last. He's predicting the fall of the Iron Curtain. That was quite a thing to write in 1973, the era of détente. But le Carre has long been able to see further than most.   Smiley and Karla rings a faint bell of bisexualism, another thing hardly considered in 1973. But take the notion of bisexualism and look at it through le Carre's long lens and you'll see the mole.   Le Carre sports with the other giant of British spy fiction, Ian Fleming. Like Fleming's James Bond, Smiley also has a Walther pistol. But Smiley carries his around in a plastic bag like it's a dead rat.   The UK's diminishment to proxy surfaces when it becomes clear what Karla is up to. Moscow is using London to get at Washington. Smiley bursts the bubble of the UK minister, who has the good grace to realize Her Majesty's Government has been a tool. If there's a flag-waving neocon faction in British politics, le Carre clearly doesn't belong to it.   Silence becomes less prevalent as Smiley gets closer to discovering the mole. Cornered, the mole shows us the banality of evil. My mind chirped - \\"You got all those people killed and hurt only for that?\\" Such is this world.   Smiley doesn't lecture or lash out much less gloat. He simply turns away and returns to his post, better girded for another round with Karla. The cinematic impact is awesome. Silence is golden.

B005WM6RUS|5.0|A friend let me borrow this book because I was looking for a good, solid read. \\"Sarah's Key\\" is well written and covers a great deal in its relatively few pages. From the story of a journalist assigned to write about an article about the involvement of the French police force and government in the ultimate deaths of thousands of French Jews during the Holocaust, to the way the journalist doggedly pursues the story and discovers how it interacts with her own life, to meeting Sarah's (after whom the book is titled) son to tell him the story in a compassionate manner. Interlaced with this is the journalist's own life experience: She writes about the coming apart of her own marriage, the depth of her relationships with her husband's family and her daughter, and about how she comes into her own towards the end of the book. I highly recommend this book.
B005DMNS4A|5.0|I love this Deluxe edition myself...no complaints here...two CD's, two booklets..plenty to like. I suggest massive doses of B-12 to the whiners out there..relax and just enjoy the music folks! Boils down to yet another great Who output with a lot of music to have and listen to time after time and still being able to get into it...
B005XQLBU4|4.0|good way to kill 20 min. easy to play. good game overall. good free app. would recommend to a friend.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|To my ears this Steven Wilson re mixed version just sounds amazing! It definately sounds way cleaner, all instruments can be heard as they are supposed to be heard and are remarkably THERE. Nice little Booklet with Ian Anderson thinking back on when this was recorded and  Steven Wilson's take on his Re Mixing efforts... I also have a few other versions of this Tull and this one was well worth buying...go for it...Finally have reached the point with Aqualung where I am satisfied with the listening experience from start to finish able to truly enjoy it FULLY! The second CD is gravy....get it...'nuff said!<br />February 25th 2012  update...I listened to this in my car for the first time yesterday and was floored at how good it sounded! Way better ability to pick out any of the instruments at any time ..or at the same time...than previous versions and previously unheard goodies abound! I can certainly go up a couple notches more on the old volume knob compared to my other versions!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|works on transformer.  classic missile defense, but touch...  gets frusrating at higher levels if you havent upgraded weapons.  all in all great game.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|I have had this Discovery version Remaster for a couple of weeks and have listened to it a few times and right off the bat it was obvious this version was better sounding than all other releases I ever picked up on THAT'S for sure! Amazing to be able to  hear ALL the instruments while they are where the band intended them to be more clearly makes for an even greater appreciation and even more respect for this band than ever. That last whack at the TV slams you hard! There are far too many details to go into detail about here but being able to listen to this after so  many listens and still be able to be amazed is...amazing! Gilmour is one of the greatest players IMHO and his electric and acoustic guitar as well as his vocals are worthy of great respect! Gotta go Hey You solo on!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|The changes that have been made are great!  We enjoy playing frequently as a family and also online.  I like the teaching option and the saves.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing it is like one big game that never ends!  I love it. it is really great.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I got this for my mom for christmas and ever since I got it for her shes lisening to it all the time.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I've played this for hours.  This one offers a new mode that is 12 challenges to get to the finale.  It's a great addition!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Downloaded this book to read on a recent trip.  Read the entire thing non-stop.  I thought the characters were engaging, the story flowed great and the ending left me wanting more.  Look forward to seeing the movie and reading the other books in the series.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|lots of fun. as much fun as the old arcade game. nice to be able to rebuild the city. trees grow back on their own
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The read along feature is amazing. I wish it did automatic bookmarking (or maybe it does but I don't know how).
B000VZUWZW|5.0|My review assumes you already like the Big Bang Theory and are wondering if you should watch early episodes you may have missed. Go ahead and start with season one. You'll see how Sheldon, Howard, Leonard and Rajesh meet Penny. Later regular characters (such as Amy) are absent from the first season, but the show is still very funny, its humor centering on esoteric science references and awkward social situations. I think the show does get better in later seasons--including introducing a live audience, whereas season one's laughter sounds canned and overstated. But the writing is still tight and clever. Very much worth watching.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is a good spin on an old game.  the upgrades are fun and encourage building defense.  HTC incredible.
B002RVCD0U|2.0|Nothing new happens in this movie. It has plenty of action, mostly in the form of explosions, but nothing in the movie actually moves the Terminator story line forward. The viewer goes out where he came in.<br /><br />Equally frustrating is that the movie insults the viewer's intelligence with lazy plot devices. For example, there are scenes involving the movement of massive, clanking machines, yet characters aren't even aware of the machines until the machines are on top of them. Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline, or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so characters can shoot them when needed to make an explosion or melt some machine.<br /><br />The movie is riddled with such devices. They play out, one after another, for about two hours. Nothing else happens. We learn nothing new.<br /><br />My recommendation is to skip this awful addition to the T series.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|There are few movies in the horror/comedy genre that pair up an easy-to-believe duo of pals. The writing is great and pacing is dead-on. I really enjoyed it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Simple yet fun playing this old school game. Got challenging the longer I played. Works great on my Kindle Fire.
1400052181|4.0|I had no desire to read this book.  I would not have other than the fact it was the monthly selection of my book club.  Within the first few chapters I was hooked - excited and enthralled by Henrietta.  Full disclosure requires that I state my own mother also was diagnosed with cervical cancer not many years after Henrietta and six months after I was born.  I was fascinated to learn that hers and Henrietta's treatments had been identical, ie being packed with radium.  My mother was told it was \\"to ease the pain\\", but miraculously for the doctors and me, she survived.  This was the first I had ever learned of the treatments for cancer in that era.  The story is fascinating and interesting for anyone touched by cancer or even just those interested in medical research.  The book was too long, and I fear, some readers might quit in the middle as I sometimes felt like doing.  It became repetitive at times and too bogged down with the commercial aspects of HeLa, Henrietta's cancer cells, and also Henrietta's descendant's stories.  Some of her relatives were inspiring and truly good people.  Others were somewhat loathsome at times, and the author seemed to spend too much time on the latter.  I would urge readers to either skim or plow through these sections for the overall good qualities of the story.  In the end, I was glad I had.  I was treated for stage four mantle cell lymphoma for three years and was expected to be dead right now.  Instead I am clean, and I now feel Henrietta's cells had a lot to do with saving my life as they have had with other cancer patients.  I just wish the author had omitted much of what she had gleaned doing her research.  There was a lot that was extraneous and did not contribute to Henrietta's story in the least.  Just because you learn details conducting research does not mean they belong in the book.  It's too bad Sklott felt they did.  Otherwise it would have been a five star accomplishment.  Regardless, my thanks to God and Henrietta.
B0063IH60K|5.0|title says it all. just hold it in land scape and your good i highly recommend it for Kids and adults as long as you know how to play
B005HSL626|3.0|This game is fun but the ads for kindle fire are intense. Its VERY annoying, yet the game is adicting and fun.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|If you were a fan of the original Middle Command,you will love this app.  I was pleasantly surprised at how challenging it got as you advanced through the game.  It is a short, fun game that helps you kill a few minutes with a touch of nostalgia.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|What a great remake of the classic game, Missle Command.  I enjoyed the original, but this version is superior!  great graphics and game design!
B005974CDU|4.0|A fine album of beautiful vocals and melodic prog. Iona weaves an atmosphere of ethereal, spiritual emotion with expert musicianship.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far I realy like this game. The games are fun, there are some games that seem difficult, but non the less addicting.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I bought the Kindle Fire for my son, so I didn't get much chance to try it out myself.  He had just gotten a new iphone so the Fire had stiff competition.  He loved reading his emails on a bigger screen and was immediately streaming Netflix.  So the setup was a snap.  What I loved is that Amazon had a rush delivery possibility (at no extra charge) for Christmas so both it and the cover arrived before the holiday!  I felt cared for as a customer.
0439023521|5.0|I purchased The Hunger Games Trilogy and read all three books in four days. This was by far my favorite series to date. Order these books. You won't be sorry.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Something to mess around with to pass time. Some of the games are pretty hokey. But, it's free. If you don't like it delete it.
B004UXUUJE|3.0|I will not go into the description of the movie since there are plenty of reviews here that do, and there's always the Amazon description. WARNING: there may be some spoilers here.<br /><br />I loved Sarah's Key the book, and was eager to see the movie. While the screen version was powerful and mostly well cast, it does not compare favorably to the book. I watched it with a few friends who have not read book, and they were confused by the movie to say the least. I was constantly filling in the story for them and explaining who everybody was. I think that midway through the movie they finally become more invested in the events, but it took a lot of work on my part to get them there.<br /><br />The movie moved too fast without much background information on the characters or the surrounding events. From my friends' point of view - they did not readily understand the Tezac family connections (I had to say \\"that's the grandmother in law, that's her husband, etc.), did not see how Sarah's story tied in, etc. The scenes switched so quickly that it was easy to miss the French involvement in Vel d'Hiv or fully comprehend where Jewish people were being taken. It was even hard to know that at one point Julia was in a clinic planning to get an abortion - the movie just showed her in a room taking a call. These are just some of the things that were poorly explained, but there were many more.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me was how minimal a role Julia's husband, Betrand, played in the movie. In the book, he was described as being dashing, charming and at times very mean in his relationship with Julia. In the movie, he was disheveled at best and only appeared a handful at times. It was impossible to truly understand their relationship from those few scenes.<br /><br />Overall, I think that those that have read the book might enjoy seeing it on screen and will be able to fill in missed details. Others will need to pay very careful attention to keep up.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|everytime i try to download an app of the day, i get a error message asking me to click on a link to verify payment method. help please??? i really want this game!
