0385535139|3.0|This isn't the best book Grisham has ever written, but even so a good John Grisham is still better than a lot of authors very best efforts.  Some of the story line was a wee bit unbelievable to me, but it's just a story - no harm done.
1612130283|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It made me laugh and cry and scream. There is just so much emotion going on here between Christian and Ana that it is hard to see where one begins and the other ends.<br /><br />Christian is this gorgeous Billionaire that has a dark side to him He keeps it hidden well from the prying eyes of everyone around him. To outsiders he is a young man who may or may not be gay because he is rarely seen with a woman. Then steps Ana into his life and things start to change hard and fast for him.<br /><br />Ana is graduating college and all she wants to do is study for her finals and move to Seattle and get a job at a small publishing company. Then her best friend and roommate gets sick and asks Ana to interview the aloof billionaire Mr Grey. Ana agrees because Kate is her best friend so she goes to meet this young billionaire who has donated money to the college and will be a key speaker at her graduation. Once she is there to meet Mr Grey and interview him she is captured by his looks and charm.<br /><br />Mr Grey is intrigued by Ana just as Ana is intrigued by him. They start to see each other on a regular basis and Ana soon finds out that Mr Grey has a dark side to him. He says and does things that are really cryptic but in the end Ana sees something she will have to learn to live with or lose Mr Grey in the end.<br /><br />What is Ana to do? Should she suck it up and accept what the terms are to being with Mr Grey or should she walk away? When you come to the ending chapters of this book you will go on one hell of a roller coaster ride. I laughed and then I cried because fantasy and reality are a hard pill to swallow. What you want is not always what you get and what you need is always a battle to maintain.<br /><br />I am off to read the second book because I need to now what happens between them. This couple has it's ups and downs and I can't wait to see how it all plays out. Decisions are made and lines are drawn in the sand and what can happen will happen but at whose expense?<br /><br />Favorite Quote Page 368 Ana and Grey: \\"I've come alive since I met you.\\" His thumb traces the contours of my lower lip. \\"Me, too,\\" I whisper. \\"I've fallen in love with you, Christian.\\" His eyes widen again, but this time, with pure, undiluted fear. \\"No,\\" he breathes as if I've knocked the wind out of him. Oh No. \\"You can't love me, Ana. No... that's wrong.\\" He's horrified.Quote Page 368 Ana and Grey: \\"I've come alive since I met you.\\" His thumb traces the contours of my lower lip. \\"Me, too,\\" I whisper. \\"I've fallen in love with you, Christian.\\" His eyes widen again, but this time, with pure, undiluted fear. \\"No,\\" he breathes as if I've knocked the wind out of him.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|No other movie has ever warmed my heart like this one. This is the best of the best muppet performances. Even  though Kermit's voice is no longer Jim Henson's, it has his spirit all throughout the movie. I've never been so touched by the little muppet characters and Michael Cain's.   It makes my Christmas each year, my children's and now, my grandchildren's.   I'm hanging on to my old VHS tape. I've noticed my favorite Christmas CD, John Denver and the Muppets had two songs eliminated on the later copies. I hope those who still have the originals to their old favorites can eventually find them intact in later versions.   I'm glad to read that others have voiced their objections loud and clear for the unjust editing of such wonderful entertainments and I am grateful for their help.
1400069181|5.0|Blake Mycoskie knows that many of us are juggling these three questions:<br />* Should I just focus on earning a living?<br />* Should I pursue my passion and find work that I love?<br />* Should I devote myself to a worthy cause that inspires me?<br /><br />Fortunately for us, in his new book Start Something that Matters, Blake tells us we don't have to choose.  As he<br />shares the story of how he started TOMS, one of the fastest-growing shoe companies in the world, he says we don't have to choose.  And furthermore, we'll have more success if we don't settle for less than combining all three elements.<br /><br />I love his chapter titles - the six steps for creating your own life.<br />1. Find your story<br />2. Face your fears<br />3. Be resourceful without resources<br />4. Keep it simple<br />5. Build trust<br />6. Giving is good business<br /><br />His business model is: \\"With every pair you purchase, TOMS will give a pair of shoes to a child in need.\\"  And he shows how doing something worthy, humanitarian and Godly can often be done better with a for-profit business.  His principles confirm everything we teach at 48Days.com and provide a very real example of someone who wouldn't settle for less than meaningful, purposeful, and profitable work.<br /><br />If your goal is to also to pursue your passion, devote yourself to a worthy cause, and make a great living, I recommend you add this book to your library now.  And the pay-it-forward process continues.  For every book purchased, Random House is donating a book to a child in need through First Book.
B005YDLJ76|4.0|I have been a great fan of Beyonce... this DVD is simply outstanding... Can't wait to have it in Blu-ray...
B001UV4XI8|4.0|Well, I guess I waited too long to pick this title up.  None of the local big box stores had the Blu-ray release with a slip cover either.  Took a chance on amazon.com still having stock, but it seems they do not.  The release I received does have the 3 discs, just no slip cover.  However, at only 10 bucks, I can live with it until the super-ultra-cool-complete 8 movie set is released sometime in 2012...
B005SAP45I|4.0|I like the duality of the message the movie tried to convey, not the environmental one, but the one where McQueen realizes he shouldn't try to change his friend but also where Mater realizes that his antics are hurtful. Who hasn't known someone who they wish would act differently while in public? As far as the violence it is really not any more prominent than in any other Pixar film, in Nemo the mother and his hundreds of siblings are all murdered in the first ten minutes. No this movie is not UP but it does tell a fun story and it tells it well. Who hasn't imagined cars as people? This movie is Pixar's interpretation of what this world would look like and I personally enjoyed it. To me Pixar is about making a story the creators want to watch and hoping others also want to watch, unfortunately this was not to everyone's taste but I applaud Pixar for continuing the franchise and cannot wait to see Planes when it is released.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|If you have seen John Carpenters The Thing, then you pretty much know the story. Alien replicates humans in antarctica, no one knows who's who or who to trust. I found this remake/prequel more enjoyable than the 1982 version, this had good pacing, story was well written that was better to follow, much more smoother and richer, better special effects in creature design and you feel that these charectors are at threat. suspenseful, entertaining, all the things that I felt that were lacking in john carpenters version, his was clearly low budget, boring and just used devices for shock value. this version was better in my opinion.
B002VX0A40|5.0|I got three of these and they arrived today. My friend and I took them out of the plastic, and fell in love with all of them straight off. These are all three gifts for my granddaughter and for a child who is like a great nephew to me. I am certain the children will love these.  The baby boy is only going to be about 4 months old come Xmas and our granddaughter will be about 9 months. I just cannot imagine that these would not hold their attention so I'm doing the review now. The crinkle sound and the different textures plus the mirrors are just wonderful ideas. I do recommend this product and all of the others that they have in this line. As I find out more, like how the babies interact, I will update but, it holds the attention of one 47-year-old woman and a 62 year old as well, lol. Thanks!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Few apps are as necessary, regardless of platform. If they made Evernote for the Wii, I'd likely install it. I use this to save important chunks of data, projects I'm working on, just about anything.
0439023521|5.0|So I'm probably one of the last ones on the Hunger Games train, but I finally made it, and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed this book, and can't wait to get to the rest of the trilogy. I am also excited about the upcoming movie. One benefit of waiting so long to start is now I don't need to wait on anything in order to get to enjoy the rest of the series.  I found the love triangle very interesting. Normally I am not a fan of love triangles, but in this one, one of the guys was absent for the entire story. It lead an interesting angle to the plot.  Throughout the story I found myself feeling very bad for Peeta. He was such a nice guy, and totally unequiped for the survivoral aspect of the games. He also seemed to suffer with Katniss. For someone so knowledgable about survival, she was quite naive when it came to emotions and relationships.  Overall, this book deserves the hype it has gotten. I'm glad I read it, and am looking forward to the rest of the trilogy.
B000000WA4|5.0|Thank you Amazon for having one of the greatest albums ever on here! This was a great gift to a friend of mine and they really appreciate it!! Amazon makes everything so easy to order and I am so glad and was surprised in the amount of time that I ordered it and received it!! Thanks for being one of the greatest outlets to buy all things amazing on the Internet!
030726999X|4.0|After racing through the first two installments, I was distracted by other reading and am only now finishing my race through THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST.  In fact, it has been a year, and picking the story up right where Stieg Larsson left off proved difficult.  A bit hard to recall all the delicious detail.  So I don't recommend stopping between Books 2&3 of this trilogy.  They are the same story, whereas Book I, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a different tale with the same lead characters, and a good introduction.<br /><br />One enjoyable facet of Larsson's detective stories is the weave of more than a few plot lines. Whereas many such whodunnits will jump from main plot line 1 to secondary plot line 2 and directly back to 1, THE GIRL WHO... series involves countless parallel, intersecting, weaving storylines that pop up almost unpredictably.  They can make understanding the whole tale confusing, a thick forest of tangled stories and characters. The reader pushes ahead, confident that somehow the spaghetti mess of a mystery will be tidied up by heroes Blomqvist or Salander or dumb luck. We trust Larsson to deliver us.<br /><br />Other reviews here allude to the sad fact of Larsson's early death, and the hurried or non-editing of this book. I concur. There are whole pages that could be chopped, and unless you wish to follow the street-by-street chase on a Stockholm GIS map, we could do without the entire street directories of greater Stockholm. (At least, here outside Sweden.)<br /><br />Nonetheless, a very interesting oater that will make any plane trip shorter.  743 pages fly by.  Highly recommend.

0446573019|2.0|Since I doubt Lee Child asked Mr. Baldacci to write the next Jack Reacher book for him, I can only assume Mr. B has had a little hiccup in the artistic integrity arena.<br /><br />Baldacci is so much better than this when he uses his own ideas.  I hope this Puller series ends with only this one zero of a book.
B004XQO8VO|5.0|The movie was excellent and the delivery was on time, actually a day early! Condition was good. We had seen this movie before but the clarity of blue ray was a major plus.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|has worked fine for me on kindle fire. my wife and I each have tootle calendars and the app lets me choose which calendar to add the events to. the look and finish is pretty polished. I like it.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|While the packaging for this affordable collection on blu-ray of Harry Potter films is sound enough, the discs themselves are somewhat strange. First, the sound is very low. I have to turn my television's volume to 100 to get it loud enough. Watching regular TV I have it set to 28. This is the case with all the discs. I don't have a 5.1 sound system, but it's still strange that the sound was mixed so low. Secondly, the movies start immediately upon inserting the disk. It gives no title menu to decide when you want to play it and no easy way to find chapters. At least there are no irritating previews and ads that are so standard now. Lastly, I am only through the first few movies but the extra features are intriguing but not in letterbox format. I assume they were filmed in standard size originally and they haven't adapted them; it's bothersome to have to switch the screen size on the TV depending on the feature. All these things are livable and the price is certainly right when on sale (though recently it seems like everyone had blu-ray Harry Potter for $10 a movie). It's been interesting to go back and watch all the movies in rapid succession and to see the improvement with every film and to watch the characters and the actors grow up right before our eyes. I recommend the collection for the price if on sale ($80), but I wonder if they're going to come out with a set in the future that'll have remastered sound, etc.
0307277887|5.0|I love the show Dexter and i think the book is just as good. It really grabs your attention and makes you want to keep reading
0937381888|5.0|I am still reading this book. Believe it or not beer is not as simple as one might think. I know this might sound strange but I don't really drink beer at all, but for some reason I feel compelled to brew. I thougt that beer was hops barley water some boiling time and then yeast. Well it really just is not that simple.  If you don't know a thing about brewing beer this is the book for you. It can be complicated at times. Though nothing to rocket science like. I can say that I did not know that there are so many types of yeast and how much each one really can effect the entire outcome of the beer. That goes double for hops.  When I finish this book I will complete my review, but you'll have to wait for sometime because I work at UPS and it is honestly to busy for me to do anything else (I started work today at 4pm, and got off at 2am)  Please have a happy holiday

B003ZSJ212|1.0|The changes are terrible.  I honestly to not understand why they made such stupid changes.  The fact that they changed Vader's lightsaber pink alone makes this a one star.  So does the part when Vader yells out noooooooo in Return of the Jedi.  Just don't buy it.
098357670X|5.0|By far, the best caricature how-to book I have ever bought.<br /><br />Written by the great caricature artist Tom Richmond, this book covers all the aspects involved in drawing a great caricature. From the concept to the key aspects to create great likenesses and expressions and how to achieve it.<br /><br />If you are into any kind of art, already draw some caricatures or even are curious on the subject, this is a must have.<br /><br />Bonus: a lot of spectacular work from Tom inside the book.
1451648537|5.0|This is a very interesting book and many people can benefit from what they learn by reading it. I can recommend it especially to students and people starting their carrier after graduation.
1451648537|5.0|I can't put this book down. I'm not done with it yet but it is fascinating. I am finding out things that I never knew about Jobs. It is read with a combination of fascination and sadness.
B003VWU2WA|1.0|this button is one of our biggest mistake purchases for our photo booth business. it works 20% of the time. I HATE that little thing. And yes, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drives countless times. It will work for a few times and then quit responding. It's awful. DO NOT BUY!
B00006CXSS|5.0|i am 73 years old. I have seen movies from King Kong up through 7 brides for 7 Brothers thru Ben Hur and The Blind Side.  Band Of brothers is the most well photographed, best directed and best acted that I have ever seen. Add to that the interviews with the real men of Easy Company and you get the Best of all time.
B001F6TXME|5.0|My only complaint is the length of the trigger wire. Other than that it is just what I wanted. No batteries required and stows away much easier.
B0063IH60K|4.0|i received this app for free in my kindle fire and i really enjoy playing it. its challenging yet fun at the same time. the game gets pretty addicting. i would definitely recommend this game to anyone especially if you get it for free like i did!

B001GJOL22|5.0|Long-time Rush fan here just to tell you if you like(or love) Rush get this Blu-Ray.If you don't have a Blu-Ray buy one just to watch this disc. My sole complaint is that some of the humour on the bonus features is a little 'high school'(guess I'm getting old). It's still pretty cool to see the boys hamming it up though. Over 3 hours of Rush bliss. Yeah,Oh,Yeah!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I devoured this book.  If it only pandered to my 80s nostalgia and general videogame interest I would have loved it, but it is also a compelling, nail biting, well written story.  A must buy, Grandizer go!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second in the series and I could not put it down!! I read it in 2 or 3 days!
0812416503|1.0|Very dissappointed!  I wanted a nice edition as a gift and this arrived with cheap newsprint-type paper, narrow page margins and blurry ink.  The binding was just as bad, feeling like thin cardboard.  A story of this calibre belongs on a bookshelf with a good binding to withstand many readings.  Returned to Amazon with no hassle whatsoever.
0439023521|5.0|i got Interested in this book in the First few pages and literally could not put it down!!This book will be on my Shelf forever!!
098357670X|5.0|I only wish this Guide was available 65 years ago.  That's when I first got serious about cartooning.  I went through all the classics at the time like Bridgman for anatomy, Loomis for figure drawing, Mullin for sports and Alex Raymond for the artistry that could be found in the comic strip.  But Tom Richmond's guide captures the best in one volume.  Thanks, Tom from all us budding artists in the field.  (Yes, I'm still actively drawing at age 79).
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Just as fun as the pc or console versions. Wish it had a garden though. Best app for the money.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|A Prisoner of Birth is the best story I've read in decades.  I'm not a young man and I, like most people, have my list of favorite authors who have always delivered a predictably great product.  Now I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't know the works of Jeffrey Archer.  I don't know why; I'm not a stay at home American.  I've lived abroad for half of my 65 years, so why does the best author of my time \\"burst\\" onto my scene so late in life?  I read a new book every three days, so volume is also not the answer.  If there are any more people out there like me who have lead sheltered existences, Jeffrey Archer is a buried treasure waiting to be discovered.  I'm currently reading \\"Kane and Able\\" and it is just as well done.  I realize that this is a review of the talents of an author more than the review of one of his works, but you MUST discover this man and his creative excellence.  Buy and read any one of his titles; you cannot possibly be dissapointed.
B005NA3B8U|3.0|this game is true to the original one I remember from the arcade days.  Unfortunately I have a had time controlling the ship, mostly because it has no virtual controls.  A virtual joystick would be nice instead of forcing me to put my finger all over the screen.  This also causes me to get shot from the back since my finger or thumb is usually blocking enemies behind me.  fix those things and maybe it can get the five that it deserves.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I tried a free app first but found it was not a good match for a beginner. This app is much better. It shows possible moves, you can adjust the levels, change to timer, and the graphics are lovely.
B005H2IAM6|1.0|This movie is just plain horrible. I grew up with this series and I have seen it all. I first began with the televised series and then eventually the full movies. I do appreciate the nods to the series, which are many, but the story is so distorted and ineffective. I understand that compressing the entire canon into 2 hours is next to impossible. I can't understand how someone who is not familiar with the series would be able to follow what is going on. There are too many plot holes. To put it bluntly, I wished I had never seen this. This is coming from a huge fan of the series. I don't want to go into detail because I hate spoilers. Watch at your own risk. Be warned.
B000068QVN|3.0|I was very excited for this release... but disappointed in the sound quality.  Performance: A  Recording and sound: D  Too bad this is the best they could come up with.  Caught in the Act live sounds better.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|I've been using Badoo for 6 months - to meet friends from worldwide. Now it's even better because they've got Android version! It's very convenient - I can check who's nearby using my phone now!  No need to worry about whether you can see people clearly on the phone because you can check other people's profiles in full screen mode. Great app to kill time and meet new friends when you are waiting for a bus/train, or in a queue. Hopefully there would be more and more features on Badoo soon.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I got the FiiO E5 to pair with my Etymoyic HF5 and soon to have UE TF10's (thank you Amazon for the Black Friday sale ware the TF10's were $95).  With my HF5's it really opened up the bass at the low and mid ranges with or without the bass boost on and that makes them really fun to listen to now.  Paired with my Cowon i10 this little amp works great for what I need and after seeing or should I say hearing how good it is I think I'm going to get the E11 next to power my new Panasonic RP-HTF600-S (which is a really good set of cans for cheap).  If you have a good set of IEM's and want to make them sound brighter especially the bass the FiiO E5 is a nice little amp to get.
0679805273|5.0|I recently bought this book for my daughter and re-reading it, realized how deeply philosophical it is and how appropriate the message remains even as an adult! What a beautiful book. I think I'll buy it for anyone I know who is in a rut and and needs a bit of inspiration.

0920236162|5.0|My parents gave me this book as a child. I think they were strongly trying to encourage me to be brave and self-sufficient person vs. a man-solves-everything princess like most female role models for young girls. The message went through loud and clear that you can be both a fantastical princess and a resourceful, independent woman. Too bad She-Ra is no longer around, but Paper Bag Princess is still a great book for putting a positive spin on the princess complex!
0553801473|1.0|I won't wax philosophical and in great detail as to why this was a disappointment; too many others have done it much more eloquently than I could. Not only did I buy the ADwD book, I downloaded the Kindle version so I'd never be without it until I finished it.  Never again.  If GRRM ever does release another installment, I'll come here and get the Cliff Notes and read the reviews before depositing another penny on this series. I thought perhaps AFfC was an abberation and surely this one would make up for it.<br /><br />Let me also add that I'm a very forgiving person for authors regarding timelines for releasing books and the occasional story dragging a bit. When I decide to buy a particular author or series, I buy and collect them all. So for me to give this highly-anticipated book 2 stars and to feel strongly enough to voice my disappointment is a rarity. I'd have given it one star, but I really like the cover and it looks good in my library. Just so.
0307165485|5.0|My parents used to read this book to me almost every night. I ordered a copy for my daughter now that I have a family myself, and was shocked at the wave of memories that came flooding back to me when I read it. Every page is so densely detailed with things that are interesting for small children. It could take days just to get through a few pages, but I remember them all!<br /><br />There are lots of pictures of transportation vehicles - our favorite pages in the whole book show the evolution of trains - from the first steam locomotives to today's bullet trains. There are also boats and airplanes to look at. There are lots and lots of cute animals, stories about the alphabet, numbers, words, and colors. There are nursery rhymes and fables, silly stories and detailed pictures to pour over.<br /><br />This book is timeless and magical for kids. It's not the trendiest of flashiest, but it will instill a love of books and keep your child busy for years.
1439192812|4.0|This Dawkins endeavor reminds me of a good 10th grade science textbook that has not yet been spoiled by anonymous censors in Texas.  A bit basic for anyone with a valid education, it is nevertheless informative and entertaining for all in its descriptive detail. I see it as a great gift for youngsters who may not be getting their fair share of real information in their school science classes.  It's also attractive enough in its design and readability to do coffee table time.  Those who like what they read should immediately go to \\"The Greatest Show on Earth,\\" Dawkins last book for grown-ups and one that debunks the notion of \\"missing links\\" as somehow being an argument against the concept of evolution.
0920668372|5.0|I love this book. So sweet and reassuring for little ones. It's a similar message to Guess How Much I Love You in terms of ensuring children feel that they are unconditionally loved, but in my opinion it's much better executed and focuses more on generosity than competitiveness.
1401324029|5.0|The book arrived on time and great condition. The story is as good as the first story. The mystery holds the suspense of the novel.
0064440346|5.0|Owl is a funny little bird. He probably encourages kids to become hoarder/clutterers by attaching human characteristics to objects, but I think he also teaches lots of important lessons in empathy that stick with you throughout your entire life. I am in my 30s, and my family still talks about tear water tea and spoons that fall behind ovens never to be seen again. I can't wait to read this book to my daughter.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|good version of mahjong but it doesn't save any of your scores. very frustrating. seems like a pretty basic function that should be working before you release a game. I would not recommend this game until that is fixed.
067144901X|4.0|Rhythmic, funny, short and sweet -- I can see why babies like this book. It's also fun for parents, which some of these children's books just aren't (let's be real). Even the title is fun to say.

B005CYLSW8|5.0|If Riccardo Chailly has recorded the Beethoven symphonies before in his long career, I'm not aware of it. This set features terrific sound quality and orchestral playing. The tempi are generally quick and the articulation precise and light. In the booklet maestro Chailly relates that Toscanini, Karajan and others have influenced his view of Beethoven. I'd say Toscanini influenced him much more than Karajan did, from the sound of these recordings. Definitely near the top for modern instrument/full orchestra Beethoven symphonies. I think almost anyone would enjoy these recordings, from novice to 'serious' listener.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I watched it on TV. But that was on the cable box. Couldn't keep it. So this is special & I can watch it whenever I want. Think it's a good program. And season 2 is getting to be exceptional as well.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The reason Owen Wilson is perfect as Allen's new leading man is that he is about as different a guy from Allen as it is possible to be. Allen's biggest missteps in his later years have involved either casting himself as the romantic lead or casting a needed younger man but then have that man impersonate him. He needed someone who would find it virtually impossible to play Woody Allen.  He found that lead with Owen Wilson. Another huge advantage to Wilson is that gives us a mainstream American and gets Allen out of his own experiences in New York of decades ago when it was daring for him to flout convention and pick non Jewish women, most notably in his movies this was Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow.  In 2011, of course, that is a very dated riff and made him out of touch.<br /><br />The movie itself is a bit derivative of Allen Rudolph's MODERNS of a few decades ago which had Keith Carradine and Wally Shawn interacting with all of these same Bohemian artists and writers of 1920s Paris.  But Allen gives it his own fresh twist with the time travel aspect.<br /><br />Wilson being bogged down with the elitist girlfriend and her parents, all American Republicans and proud and vocal about that fact, are the only predictable element to the movie. These kinds of characters are always in his movies as anathema to the soul of the artist.<br /><br />Michael Sheen is unrecognizable as the pedantic Paul, an American professorial acquaintance, and does his usual marvelous acting job. Kathy Bates is wholly believable as Gertrude Stein.  Hemingway is his usual bull in the china shop self. Zelda Fitzgerald is seriously crazy.<br /><br />It is definitely a feel good movie and is remarkably upbeat for an Allen film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B002ZG994U|5.0|I watched the Original series way back when.  I simply could not believe it when I saw it on the preivew at the movies.  The Audience I think Enjoyed it better then the movie.  And my 12 year old son loves it.  It totally lived up to the original series.  The cast really and truly was a modern updated version of the show.  Which Truly surprised me.  I just wish I could find it on extened version, but I will taked what I can get.  I don't get why the critic's panned the movie.  It's awsome.  I really hope they make another with the same cast that's really and truly the only way it would work.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite books, it does have a great plot and a lot of surprises that'll keep you wanting more... The characters are very well described and you get really attached to them. It does have a lot of romantic parts between Peeta and Katniss which I actually did enjoy. It is also nice because it talks about an authoritarian society with a dictator (President Snow, I believe is what his name is). There was a revolution awhile back and the government WON (how's that for a change), so now every year the government randomly selects 2 citizens (male/female) from each of the 12 districts. They each have to compete TO THE DEATH in the Hunger Games. It is televised all of the country and the government advertises it as an exciting event where people get to serve their government, when in reality it is just the government's way of showing that they are the ones who have the power and control over the people. If nothing good is happening in the games, the government take it upon itself to light some things on fire and kill of some of the competitors itself to get things going.   Alright, enough rambling about the story now, go read it yourself-You wont regret it!

B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this book a few years ago and because I loved it so much, I figured I would share my thoughts with the people on Amazon considering this great read.   This book describes a Utopian \\"perfect\\" society,\\" where there is no pain-no love-no fear-no hunger-and no segregation. Everyone is 'the same' as described in the book. At around age 12, everyone is required to begin taking a medication that suppresses the urge to *ahem* reproduce, so that the government can control the population very easily. SPOILER: when a twin is born or when someone commits a crime one time too many, they are released--executed. This is where Jonas decides that his \\"perfect\\" society may be a lot less perfect than he thought. A perfect society comes at a great cost, no one can decide for themselves, the government decides everything. SPOILER: for the entire book, everything is in black and white, so no one can see in color! Some of the most important people in this book are the geneticists who control what a person will look like before they are born, they make it so no one can see in color. Also, HUGE SPOILER: no one can hear music, so that no one can be overly-happy (this is huge because it is the core of the ending of this book).   I 100% love this book, it creates a complete society in your mind where everything seems so perfect, and only one-two people (the Giver and the Receiver) know the truth and this history of the world.   I definitely recommend reading this book to almost anyone, it is very interesting and a page-turner that you wont be able to put down until your done, and you'll be glad you read it!

1612680003|1.0|Question - If a person genuinely knows how to make big money - why would they want to tell the whole world how to do it?  Answer: Because they make money from YOU, the book buyer.   This book is slow, the content is often meaningless and sometimes bordering on being a spoof. There is nothing RK knows about the real world of work or entrepreneurship.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book just a few days ago and happily stayed up late every night until I finished the book. I literally could not put it down. It is truly one of the best books I've read in a very long time. The author weaves a very interesting and original story with colorful characters and a unexpected ending. I look forward to reading the second and third books of this author's brilliant trilogy.

B004SUDQ4U|5.0|I just saw the movie (3,5 hrs) I just can't remember seeing such a long movie without noticing. Please don't get me wrong the movie is far from being fast paced  but nevertheless it's always charged with suspense.  As others remarked the captain role is performed flawless and in general the all cast is quite well in theirs parts.  The sound is superb!! really. I have a home theater and ....what can I say? deep charges almost blown out my apartment to pieces!! lol.  Few movies can achieve that level of sound performance. Really really great   For those interest in U-Boat I recommend [[ASIN:1848326440 MEMOIRS OF KARL DOENITZ, THE: Ten Year and Twenty Days]] excellent book! Just be aware that doenitz didn't know at the time that the Allies had the enigma machine (the codex-decoder for messaging) that was a mayor factor for finishing the U-Boat threat.

098357670X|5.0|I've always found art instruction books to be lacking. I've always wished they were laid out a bit more logically and would show you both what you should do, as well as what you Shouldn't do.      This book has all that and a ton more.    Richmond breaks it all down into the head shape, eyes, nose, mouth, lower face (jaw, chin, cheekbones, ears), upper head (eyebrows, forehead, hair), and even goes into the neck, shoulders, and hands.  With whole sections on drawing live caricatures, caricature in illustration, and a Mad Magazine illustration job from start to finish, I doubt there has ever been (or probably will be) a more comprehensive guide to drawing caricatures.  It takes concepts that eluded me for some time and breaks them down so simply and logically that it has saved me hundreds of hours of practice.    I've followed Richmond's blog at [...] for quite some time now because of the invaluable drawing tips, but this book takes all those and goes so much further.  I simply cannot recommend it highly enough.
B002VECM6S|1.0|Never before has such utter mediocrity grouped with just plain old fashion bad storytelling and ham-fisted acting received so much praise and attention. That this was actually \\"honored\\" with a Best Picture nomination from AMPAS is beyond laughable. Indeed, I subsequently disregarded anything to do with the Oscars and specifically because of the populist influence in their awards process which led to this pablum being part of the ceremonies.
B0060V1WJ6|3.0|The cast all had good chemistry and this movie definitely had funny moments - but also some cliche moments, but what do you expect when you have a movie about love?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although I had heard much about The Hunger Games and was intrigued to read it, I must admit I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, largely because I knew it was YA, which I don't normally read.   I thoroughly enjoyed it, though, and can see it becoming a classic dystopian novel. In fact, at times, the odd sentence here and there would remind me of A Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Overall, the entire concept of the book reminded me of The Running Man by Stephen King, but not in a derivative way.   The premise is simple; in the future, following some kind of war and rebellion, the United States cease to exist, and are replaced by twelve districts, each with its own responsibility to the Capitol, which is high in the Rockies. District 12 is the poorest of them all, and supplies the Capitol with coal.   That's where Katniss and Peeta come from. They are selected to represent their district in the annual Hunger Games, a fight-to-the-death in which a boy and a girl from each district, aged between 12 and 18, compete.   The characters are simply brilliant, though explicit description is rather sparse. They are all believable characters, who progress naturally in a very unforced way throughout the book, i.e. they don't suddenly become savage killers when the games begin, they progress naturally and become more ruthless as they become more desperate to survive.   Katniss is a wonderful character, truly three-dimensional, tough without being ruthless, naive in some things but very clever overall. She's one of the few likeable main characters I've come across in a long time, who isn't entirely flawless. She's very natural, and real, as are all the characters in the book.   Every single page is packed with suspense and tension.   Adult readers; please, do not let the fact that this novel is marketed for a young adult audience put you off. I made that mistake, and delayed reading it for quite some time (until I saw the trailer for the movie, in fact). It's a genuinely brilliant book, and I say that as an adult who didn't even read much YA fiction while I was in that age group.
B001EO2UJK|1.0|About dynamic range analysis: dynamic range is the difference in volume between the softest and loudest parts of a song. In the past, records used to have a dynamic range of 12 to 14, typically. Today, possibly because of devices like IPod, the remastering engineers typically compress (or narrow) the dynamic range to values of 6 to 8 (except in classical music). The advantages and disadvantages of the practice are:<br /><br />1. Advantage - narrowing the dynamic range is helpful when listening to an IPod. Otherwise, soft passages will not be heard over street and train noises while louder passages will damage your hearing.<br /><br />2. Perceived (but usually not real) advantage - \\"narrowing the dynamic range allows one to hear details not heard otherwise.\\" This results in the illusion that compressed recordings have more clarity. It is not so. All you need to do to hear the details you never heard before is to increase the volume. That's not a problem on a home system, and cases where the loud passages will become too loud just because you want the soft passages to be audible are rare.<br /><br />3. Disadvantage - compressing the dynamic range often results in a substantial reduction in the quality of sound. This happens because part of the process of compression is to make the recording louder. If the volume is increased to such levels that are above the maximum allowed by a CD, some of the music is lost and a distortion occurs, just like \\"recording in the red\\" in cassette tape days. A sign that almost always means distortion is when the peak levels in dynamic range analysis are 0.00 for each song - the maximum allowed by CD.<br /><br />4. Disadvantage - Listening to compressed music is also very tiring for the brain and results in exhaustion and the inability to listen for long periods. For further details you could check out \\"loudness wars\\" on you tube or Wikipedia.<br /><br />5. Disadvantage - narrowing the dynamic range does not allow for a musical idea to bedeveloped and led into a (loud) emotional climax and therefore takes away from the effectiveness of music.<br /><br />6. Disadvantage - increasing the loudness and compressing the dynamic range of every single track such that all tracks have a maximum volume of 0.00 (the most a CD allows) distorts the balance between song volumes. There are no loud and quiet songs anymore. Everything is about the same...Can you imagine, say, \\"comfortably numb\\" and \\"outside the wall\\" from pink floyd's \\"the wall\\" played at the same volume? its a travesty.<br /><br />Low dynamic range values (6-8 or so) are more suitable for IPods, while if you are listening at home on a decent system, you should aim for a DR value of 11 at least. I think its shameful that record companies do not report dynamic range details. There are two types of recordings on the market today - compressed and not compressed, and each serves a different purpose (IPod vs. home listening). The record companies are currently getting away with selling you a product without telling you which of these goals it will serve well. Demand the information as customers!<br /><br />I will not be reviewing the music, simply providing the dynamic range analysis for your benefit so you can see if this album fits your listening patterns. This is widely acknowledged as a masterpiece, an opinion I agree with.<br /><br />Verdict - This set is heavily compressed and not of acceptable quality for home listening. To show my point, I will present dynamic range analysis of the lamb lies down on broadway. The other cds show similar results.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Analyzed: Genesis / The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (2008 Remaster)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />DR  Peak  RMS  Duration Track<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />DR8  0.00 dB  -10.22 dB  4:52 01-The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway<br />DR7  -0.01 dB  -10.51 dB  2:45 02-Fly On A Windshield<br />DR9  -0.01 dB  -12.08 dB  2:11 03-Broadway Melody Of 1974<br />DR9  -0.03 dB  -12.21 dB  2:13 04-Cuckoo Cocoon<br />DR7  0.00 dB  -9.63 dB  8:12 05-In The Cage<br />DR8  0.00 dB  -11.46 dB  2:46 06-The Grand Parade Of Lifeless Packaging<br />DR7  0.00 dB  -9.25 dB  5:45 07-Back In N.Y.C.<br />DR8  -0.02 dB  -12.55 dB  2:10 08-Hairless Heart<br />DR8  0.00 dB  -9.69 dB  3:41 09-Counting Out Time<br />DR7  0.00 dB  -10.60 dB  5:15 10-Carpet Crawlers<br />DR8  0.00 dB  -11.57 dB  5:45 11-The Chamber Of 32 Doors<br />DR8  0.00 dB  -10.26 dB  2:49 01-Lilywhite Lilith<br />DR8  0.00 dB  -11.89 dB  5:17 02-The Waiting Room<br />DR7  0.00 dB  -10.28 dB  3:17 03-Anyway<br />DR8  0.00 dB  -10.92 dB  2:49 04-Here Come The Supernatural Anaesthetist<br />DR7  0.00 dB  -11.03 dB  6:58 05-The Lamia<br />DR11  -0.06 dB  -16.87 dB  3:01 06-Silent Sorrow In Empty Boats<br />DR8  0.00 dB  -10.53 dB  8:12 07-The Colony Of Slippermen<br />DR10  -1.80 dB  -16.23 dB  2:06 08-Ravine<br />DR7  0.00 dB  -9.34 dB  3:32 09-The Light Dies Down On Broadway<br />DR7  0.00 dB  -9.99 dB  4:07 10-Riding The Scree<br />DR7  -0.01 dB  -11.74 dB  2:22 11-In The Rapids<br />DR7  0.00 dB  -8.62 dB  4:19 12-It<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Number of tracks:  23<br />Official DR value: DR8<br /><br />and now for an analysis of the classic records lp version:<br /><br />Analyzed: Genesis / The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway [Classic Records 200g DoLP]<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />DR Peak RMS Duration Track<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />DR13 -1.95 dB -17.89 dB 4:50 01-The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway<br />DR9 -4.70 dB -17.31 dB 2:42 02-Fly On A Windshield<br />DR13 -3.24 dB -20.94 dB 2:10 03-Broadway Melody Of 1974<br />DR10 -9.11 dB -22.92 dB 2:13 04-Cuckoo Cocoon<br />DR11 -2.86 dB -18.45 dB 8:09 05-In The Cage<br />DR12 -3.39 dB -19.54 dB 2:46 06-The Grand Parade Of Lifeless Packaging<br />DR12 -2.47 dB -18.25 dB 5:47 07-Back In N.Y.C.<br />DR10 -4.75 dB -19.04 dB 2:05 08-Hairless Heart<br />DR13 -3.58 dB -19.26 dB 3:40 09-Counting Out Time<br />DR11 -2.98 dB -18.43 dB 5:13 10-The Carpet Crawlers<br />DR12 -3.40 dB -20.82 dB 5:41 11-The Chamber Of 32 Doors<br />DR11 -4.57 dB -18.52 dB 2:44 12-Lilywhite Lilith<br />DR11 -3.67 dB -19.30 dB 5:19 13-The Waiting Room<br />DR12 -1.95 dB -18.71 dB 3:16 14-Anyway<br />DR10 -3.93 dB -18.40 dB 2:48 15-The Supernatural Anaesthetist<br />DR11 -2.87 dB -20.36 dB 6:56 16-The Lamia<br />DR11 -8.14 dB -25.70 dB 3:06 17-Silent Sorrow In Empty Boats<br />DR13 -2.36 dB -18.86 dB 8:11 18-The Colony Of Slipper Men (The Arrival - A Visit To The Doktor - The Raven)<br />DR11 -14.44 dB -29.95 dB 2:03 19-Ravine<br />DR11 -3.89 dB -18.39 dB 3:31 20-The Light Dies Down On Broadway<br />DR10 -5.45 dB -18.87 dB 3:55 21-Riding The Scree<br />DR10 -4.71 dB -20.20 dB 2:20 22-In The Rapids<br />DR11 -5.18 dB -18.17 dB 4:20 23-it<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Number of tracks: 23<br />Maximum peak difference (-1.95 dB - -14.44 dB): 12.49 dB<br /><br />Official DR value (Song Mode): DR11<br /><br />Not only is the dynamic range compressed, but since most songs peak at maximum allowable volume, distortion is present too. In addition, the compression is strong enough to distort the balance between song volumes (note how \\"ravine\\" is about 2 decibals quieter on this cd that other songs but about 10 decibals quieter on the lp?). Finally, the dynamics and emotional peaks and lows the dramatic music of Genesis is known for are gone. A travesty, no less. This is analogous to, say, buying a cheap print in low resolution of a Van Gogh.
0470474874|5.0|I am very pleased with my recent purchase. I ordered it for a friend.. It is exactly what he wanted and he is also very happy.
B005XG8V2A|5.0|I had never heard of Lana Del Ray until I read a short interview with her in Filter magazine, accompanied by a few sultry pictures of a beautiful girl looking like a model with big (probably) collagen exploded lips, something I'm no big fan on generally... but for some reason on her, it works, like an accessory. Maybe she's just putting on a pout and the rest is done with lipstick, but something tells me she did this as a quick way to grab attention, get people talking and interested in looking, so they would listen, and it's working.   I wasn't expecting much when I searched for her on YouTube, just curious to see what she sounded like and boy was I surprised, what an amazing voice! But more than that, her tone, her inflections, her demeanor... she wants to be Lauren Bacall, she's a throwback to the female crooners of the world war era while exuding an aura of next gen, like a brand new iphone!  OK, I'll say it, she's everything Amy Winehouse couldn't be, because Amy wasn't really pretty, and you could feel Amy was trapped, always struggling against it, that's what gave her depth, but also led to her end. Lana reaches there in a different way, with much more playfulness and less pain, like she's in control of her destiny. She's no victim.  Lana Del Ray could be to swoon what Taylor Swift has become for country, a breath of fresh air. I hope she's her own girl, that she doesn't have a battery of handlers designing her entire persona, I don't know her at all yet, she comes out of nowhere, but what I heard on this CD, or rather the videos she's produced, Video Games has already gotten over 8 million views on YouTube, has made me a fan for life. If Megan Fox could sing, she'd be Lana Del Ray, that's one movie I'd pay to see. They certainly share the same instinctive intelligence for throwing curves.  Immediately, ask Lana to sing the next Bond theme. We found our new Shirley Bassey.
B004EPYZT4|2.0|I've never seen the Ah-nuld version of Conan so this was my first and last foray with the barbarian.  Just a dreadful film, the continuity is just terrible and the dialogue inane. When Ron Perlman is in a production I know it's either first rate or a paycheck role for him. This one is clearly a paycheck with some residual deal I'd wager. I think Jason Momoa was cast for his ability to scowl. Rachel Nichols, lacking her natural blonde hair, is sorely misused. She's either a tough, kick-azz heroine or a screaming damsel in distress. She's way too smart for this role. Stephen Lang is unrecognizable and that is probably to his benefit. He can leave this off his resume and deny all involvement.
B000002AQQ|5.0|My husband and I watched Forrest Gump a week ago.  We have seen it before, but we were both surprised that we have never noticed all the great songs in the soundtrack.  I immediately went online and ordered it from Amazon.com.  If you like great oldies, you will love this soundtrack!

0596009208|4.0|Head first Java is great book for beginners to Java programming. The approach they fallow to explain the concepts with pictures and short stories allow readers to have more fun and easy to understand than the serious learning.  If you are an object oriented Programmer already, this may not be the good book for you to learn Java, but if you are a not familiar to Object oriented concepts, this is the right book for you.  As an experienced Java programmer and teacher, I was always in search of a good book to refresh my fundamentals and to fill the gaps period. I found this book more helpful for me and also for the students for the same purposes.  To summarize, good book to learn Java basics. Buy one and keep reading.:)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great for on the go.  Easy to use and plenty of devotionals.  However, it lacks some of the study tools of others.
0321704452|4.0|Why Naked?  The idea of presenting naked came from Japanese Bath together \\"naked\\". Garr Reynolds adopts the concept as removing un-necessary to expose what is necessary. Naked presentation is about being yourself being transparent and not hiding behind the technology, tools, and techniques to present a memorable speech. This book is not a step by step manual or tutorial about how to deliver presentations. This book is about how to do it in a better way.  What did I learn and what should you learn?  The book describes to connect with the audience emotionally with the five proven ways that comes from acronym PUNCH. Personnel, Unexpected, Novel, Challenging and Humorous. Also the three things that evaluate the presenter's own ability to project to audience apart from the content are: the way he looks, the way he moves and the way he sounds.  The other thing that I learnt from this book is it is not important how can presenter more interesting to the audience, but it is important how the presenter can demonstrate why the particular topic is more important to the audience. Also involve the audience in the presentation by playing a video clip or having discussion activity. It is also important to change the plans to suite audients need. Not speak too fast and paying attention how the audience is responding considering the short human attention span.  When you present you trying to create a change in people's mind. Delivering a powerful finish requires that you need to understand your audience. He says end on a positive note that gives people hope and encouragement to keep learning on their own.  Summary  As said earlier this book is not a step-by-step manual about presenting and communicating, but focuses more into delivery. It focuses on how to vary the pace, focus on the here and now, emotionally connecting with audience and sustaining that connection till you answer the last question. I have learned lot of above mentioned things and I strongly recommend reading and saving this book.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|This is an excellent little case if you're just looking for something to protect your Kindle when you're carrying it around. I've read the other reviews and most complaints seem a bit trival. There is a \\"new product smell\\" but it dissipates. The case fits snugly, there isn't any extra room for accessories, but what I like is that it doesn't add any bulk to the Kindle itself. The padding is definitely sufficient to protect the unit just fine. The case has a classy look to it, with good workmanship, but is a tad overpriced - I'd say $20 is a bit more reasonable. All in all a good purchase.

B000VNMMQG|4.0|For whatever reason, the 18th century has always seemed such an important time in history to me.  So much happened and so much was changed.  _Amazing Grace_ looks at one of those changes in the abolition of slave trade in the British Empire.  I love how the film captured the times in the attitudes of people and the little things that they did and said.  It is not perfectly historically accurate (it does not claim to be a documentary or anything) but I do believe it a generally accurate representation of events and people.    Overall, it is an enjoyable film that can be viewed as a thoughtful entertainment but also would be an excellent starting point for considering the historical events that lead to the abolition of slave trade and eventually slavery throughout the British Empire.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I keep checking for updates so i can play more games over and over again . It is SO worth 99 cents!
B004LROUW2|3.0|The story was a trifle banal and the observations about society and culture facile.  But at its heart it was a competent effort but lacking zeal.  I'm not certain but the translation is a bit flat as well.<br /><br />What ruined the book for me is that it was drowning in minutiae and gave too much back story to minor characters that had a limited impact on the narrative and the protagonists Tengo and Aomame.  This over-writing caused the book to drag horribly in parts and buried the central plot under seemingly endless reams of detail which were not helpful, insightful, or entertaining.<br /><br />There were cliches everywhere in this book that are often trying to be cute and intellectually subversive but just read as tired.  One example would be: \\"I move, therefore I am.\\"  There are many others.<br /><br />The entire connection to Orwell and 1984 is handled very superficially and with no verve...the reading of the text too was very tired.<br /><br />Then there's Aomame's discussion of 1Q84 versus 1984.  Lots of double speak and tedious intellecualizations which remain dreary, repetitive, and uninspired (see chapter 'Without Love'...don't even get me started on the sad chapter titles).<br /><br />Several characters are just over done: like Tengo's father and his life as an NHK collector and then the detective/researcher Ushikawa.<br /><br />I could add a great deal more but I do not want to ruin the end of the story (not climax...there is no climax) for anyone.  Let me just stay that it was handled unimaginatively...which is in keeping with the rest of this book.<br /><br />Definitely not my a favourite Murakami to date.  Hence the rating.<br /><br />Not even Murakami can hit it outta the park every time.  And though the book is not up to his usual standards it's still an okay read...but not more than okay.
1401230423|5.0|One of my favorite authors, Neil Gaiman has created a masterpiece in the Sandman series.  Volume 4 in his trade paperback series of 11 is a amazing standout.  Serial killers, Cats, and tales of the Endless abound in this bundle of yarns frought with peril, suspense and originality.  You can't go wrong with anything Gaiman.

B0034G4P80|5.0|This movie was exhilerating to all my senses (my spider senses especially). When Thor got his majic hammer back towards the end, I actually cried. I do hope he ends up reuniting with his love interest. Got to do it and have it !!!
B005DI65L2|2.0|It sounds like it would be a great book, but it tends towards really boring and somewhat sleep inducing. It seems like more of a long article than an entire book. I was very intrigued by the subject but the book didn't live up to the title. Many of the 'experiments' seemed nonsensical and not really effective at supporting her points. If you want to read it - check it out from the library, it's not a keeper.
B001BPQT8A|3.0|If we're going on the basis of a movie review, the movie gets a 5. Seeing Brad Pitt play a character that isn't meant to be the \\"pretty boy\\" that he is portrayed as shows his versatility in acting. Morgan Freeman is all I need to say about his partner in crime, and that should be enough to tell anybody reading this review that he played a flawless character and was a great foil to Pitt's Detective Mills.  The atmosphere created in the movie, the plot, everything was brilliant. I need not go in-depth, as so many others have touched on everything I could hope to say.  I will instead talk about the \\"Blu-ray Book\\" that I purchased. It was a great idea, and offers interesting insight about the movie's background, the actors, and talks about the infamous ending that shook the world. While it was a great idea, what the heck?? The binding of the \\"book\\" is the cheapest material I have ever seen. The only way you could possibly make the book actually stay where it belongs, IN THE DVD CASE, is if you half open the pages to the point where it isn't even worth trying to read what's on their pages. By the time I got to the part about the ending (last two pages), the binding had completely fallen off, leaving me with a detachable book that I really didn't want to BE detachable. I give the book 1 star.  5 stars + 1 star/2 = 3 stars. Sorry, but I can't review this fantastic movie without saying that I am a little disappointed in their packaging.
B005CMSDKA|4.0|We liked this movie quite a bit.  It's somewhat interesting and VERY stylishly done, with a great techno soundtrack.  However, it's a bit light on plot so don't expect a lot of intellectual substance here; it's more like a typical action thriller that's quite a bit more colorful and unusual than the average.  Many unique characters, with an interesting premise but very little back story really, so it's more just an amusement park ride to electronica.  I can understand all the varied reviews with almost an even number giving each star rating 1-5; because it's different, I can see that many people will love it or hate it or rightfully be ambivalent about it.  We ended up buying the soundtrack also because we like that kind of music as well.
0307389839|5.0|It is sometimes amusing to realize that authors, through the ideas they share, have the power to change behavior.  This is such a change that Haruki Murakami initiated in my behavior through his book \\"Autoportrait de l'auteur en coureur de fond\\".  He describes in synthetic terms the three ingredients that makes a great writer, i.e.: talent, concentration and perseverance.  Throughout the book, Murakami  explains how he became a long distance runner and how his running discipline helped shape his writing style.   Apart from elevating my own goal setting, I was impressed enough with his tight and simple writing style that I bought two of his earlier works: \\"La ballade de l'impossible\\", et \\"Le passage de la nuit\\".  I will keep in mind the very humane quotation from a Japanese Olympic champion when asked by Murakami if he found it difficult sometimes to wake up and go training.  \\"All the time\\", the champion responded!  Pain is always there, but suffering is optional.

1451648537|5.0|I ran through the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. What a life it was, and what a personality Jobs had!  Yes, he surely had \\"Narcissic Personality Disorder\\", he was not easy to deal with, and he was not always likable in his interaction with others, but what great products and concepts he brought to this world:    -McIntosh    -Pixar Movies    -iMac    -the Apple Stores    -iPod    -iTunes    -iPad  He also kew about leadership, and he knew that to succeed you shall not try to please everybody....  A must read book!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you notice all the reviews that are 3 stars or less came out before this was released so they are just nerds complaining about the theatricl versions not being included. Everything else they say is a lie. I have personally watched all 6 films and most of the bonus features, here are the facts.  Q I heard Puppet Yoda was dubbed over with CG Yoda in Episode 5 and 6 is that true?  A No he is still the classic puppet Yoda  Q Dose Greedo Shoot first?  A No, in this version Han shoots a milla second earlier  Q How is the picture quality?  A Episodes 1-3 looks phenominal, Episodes 4-6 look greatly improved but could be better.  Q Dose Darth Maul speak now?  A Yes he has about 5 lines of dialog added in Episode 1  Q Any significant changes?  A Very minor tweaks only uber fans would notice. Over the course of all 6 movies, about 5 minutes of new footage added, and 2 seconds of alterd scenes. Most notable When Darth Vader chucks the emporer in that pit he shouts No.  Q What is the deal with the 90 minute spoof feature  A It's a collection of many Starwars moments from Tv Shows, Movies, music videos, Stand up, and online vidoes. They are hilarous.  Q How is the box?  A It's the thickness of 3 DVD's and the same length and Hight. It's also extremley durable, so don't worry about it wearing out.

1451648537|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. As someone who is in the field of marketing / business, I enjoyed the book a lot. I can understand some people criticizing the author, but most do it to feel better about themselves. It is what it is and you can learn a lot from this man's life. It reminds you that sometimes sugarcoating things, especially in business brings the worst out of people and thus does not allow your business to be great.   He is not a politician and does not need to have an image of a saint to the public. Those that are offended by his actions should take a look at themselves and try to judge what they see in the mirror first.  As you read this book, you don't need to buy into his lifestyle. You should take what you need and move on. I can't imagine you not gaining any knowledge after reading this book.   Start reading. It's great.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is amazing. It makes me sweat like crazy everytime.  The best part about this dvd is that all the levels are 20 minutes so it is great if you are short on time.  It does not compromise intensity or workout effect at all.  Love it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|great game to be in your own world/zone. a blast from the past that is still true to the original.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|The first half of this movie was simply excellent. Character development was spot on, story development kept me on the edge of my seat, and of course...Kurt Russel played his role perfectly (\\"Stagger Lee\\" in the juke box was a nice touch). The look and feel of the film definitely has an authentic retro vibe to it. But then something changed.  (Spoilers)   After the horrific head on collision, the movie takes a different turn into a world of character over development. Too much time is spent listening in on conversation between 4 girls who seem to exist in a 1 dimensional world of pointless gossip and foul talk. The store front, restaurant, and farm scenes are all stretched out way too long for any practical purpose of story telling. I really can't imagine anyone being captivated by this (does Tarantino think this is good stuff?). Very little is seen of Kurt Russels villainous character that was so wonderfully built up in the first half of the movie. As a matter of fact, everything that was so great in the first half of the movie, was completely thrown to the wayside in the second half. Stunt man Mike is no longer the mysterious psycho we knew earlier, but a whimpering after thought who appears in the very end of the movie to get the snot kicked out of himself comic book style.  Total shame. This movie could've been great...really great.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|This is a wonderful app for handling quick notes. I think many of the negative reviewers must not know that you can use Swype with this app. Just open the menu and choose the keyboard.  I love this app.  I use skype most of the time, and then my finger for quick diagrams.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would like to have a quicker way to access the keyboard. A little software button would be perfect
0892818875|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but have had difficulty in making my own. Learned so much more about the art of healing the spirit. Thank you for such great service. Now at least I know which oils to purchase in order to find balance and the essence of healing.
0385535139|5.0|The only problem with Grisham, Sandford (Camp), and Crais novels is that I have to wait so long until their next books are published. \\"Hilarious\\" does not do enough to describe Grisham's latest book. Highly recommend that \\"The Litigators\\" be awarded the Best Line in a Novel Award for page 297: \\"Judge Seawright shook his head as if he'd been slapped ...\\" (You have to read the book to find out why it's funny.)

B002BWP49M|3.0|This comment is mostly for some \\"real\\" men out there.  Here, in Montreal (Québec, Canada), you can't say that you like \\"Breaking Dawn\\" if you're a \\"real\\" man. It's not cool. It's not manly. People will think of you as weak or \\"girlie\\". In general, if you're a \\"real\\" man, it's a good thing to say that you went because your girlfriend or your wife forced you. Is it the same where you are? Anyhow, I liked it immensely. And I don't consider myself a \\"weak\\" man nor do I think that I'm more in touch with my feminine side than any other regular Joe. My point is: I doubt seriously anyone who destroys this movie on the simple basis that it's a \\"chick flick\\".   If you didn't like it because of its narrative structure or whatever technicality, it's one thing. I can respect that. This film, like the others, isn't an intellectual movie made to re-invent cinema. \\"Breaking Dawn\\" employs clichés after clichés and I would even describe it as \\"cheesy\\"... but in a good way. It is honest with what it is trying to achieve. The characters are consistent and true to themselves. The movie starts and we're right there in the action. We don't waste any time with any sort of intro. The scenes flow very well and the rhythm is always good.  The actors (especially Kirsten Stewart) are better and better. I didn't think the fourth book would make a great movie, let alone a two-part movie but I stand corrected. This first part was awesome. All to the honor of the director. I was sad that it was over. The book is well respected. And the ending is just as great as the one in \\"Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part One\\". You have to remain seated through the end credits though cause there is one more scene later on that will set up the next installment. During the projection, you will even spot Stephanie Meyer, the author of the novels, in one of the scenes. She's smiling directly at us (we're seeing her through Bella's point of view) and it's touching cause this whole thing is \\"her baby\\".   Noreally, this film as a lot going for it. If you dismiss it on the simple fact that you're a \\"real\\" man and that the characters talk too much about their feelings, well maybe you should re-evaluate your own relationship with your tender-half. Maybe you're jealous of the love Bella and Edward have for each other? Maybe you feel like you're not showing enough affection the way Edward or Bella do?   Go see it. Let your manly armor down for two hours. After that, if you have constructive criticism, then God bless you. I'm all ears.
1451627289|4.0|This is a great story and King took the usual premise of time travel and spun it a bit.  What would happen if you were able to go back in time to change a major event or kill a tyrant? Would all of the changes be good or might some turn out wrong? If you are very interested in the minutiae of Lee Harvey Oswald's life, this book probably won't bore you as often as it did me.  I found myself skimming a lot of the time, trying to find the sections where something of interest happens.  I think King could have removed at least 150-200 pages and made a leaner, more interesting book.
B003HTPHSQ|2.0|Not my idea of a blues cd, probably enjoyed by others but not to my liking, the artist is ok but the songs leave me cold.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I had planned on writing a review right after reading this book, but it was so compelling that I had to go straight to the sequel after finishing this one to see what would happen.  I just wanted to add my reaffirmation to the positive reviews on this book.  I was pulled in almost immediately, and could NOT tear myself away from trying to find out what would happen next.  The primary characters (Christian and Ana) and the secondary characters (their family and friends) were all ones that I felt drawn to, so while I was mainly interested in what was going on with Christian and Ana, I really enjoyed the broader cast of characters in this story.  I particularly enjoyed the mystery surrounding Christian and the slow uncovering of what he's experienced, and I really enjoyed Ana's voice in this.  I didn't know what to expect going into this and frankly, my expectations were probably on the low side.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised about so many things in this book including the witty e-mail exchanges (hilarious!) and scorching sex scenes.  I would normally dock a half star for a couple nitty things like some of the edits and repetition/frequency on the \\"internal goddess\\" and \\"oh my\\" comments, but this book was so intensely wonderful to read that I couldn't.  It is definitely an unusual \\"romance\\" if I could even try to categorize this story that simply, but so well worth the read.  I am still thinking about this story and plan on re-reading this soon.
B005PR2FD8|1.0|After all the bad stuff the creator of Tekken said about the live action movie (I liked) as a fan I expected this to be amazing and it looks amazing but that's all you will get from it. The story is weak the choice for the character is questionable and once again the story what were they thinking by the end you will be like what and what. The main problem is they tried to give it a unique story and it turns into a cheap anime movie.  The Good  Looks amazing   Alice vs Ling Xiaoyu fight amazing   Jin Kazama vs Heihachi Mishima vs Kazuya Mishima fight truly amazing   The Bad  The Story so Bad Broken I won't go in to details but you will see.  The lack of characters   The questionable main characters.  It turns in to Naruto at the end with Devil Jin vs Devil Kazama and after the more ridiculous Devil Jin vs Heihachi Mishima empowered by the legendary spirits of the Mokujins as a Giant Monster no joke.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|I read this immediately after finishing Fifty Shades of Grey, because I had become so addicted to getting more of Christian and Ana's story.  And, I was not disappointed with the sequel.  It continues with the same intensity as the first book, but with more twists and turns and revelations, but with the same witty e-mail exchanges and scorching sex scenes.  I know this review will not do the book justice, because I can't describe the way that EL James takes you into this story that makes it so incredibly compelling.  I almost feel a bit obsessed now with the characters, and I haven't felt this way about a book since the Twilight series when it first came out.  The only nitty comment is that there is one scene towards the latter half of the book that strikes me as a bit unrealistic, but it's really a small nit and I suspect this will be flushed out in the final book.  I am very much anticipating the release of the final book in the trilogy!
0385534639|2.0|I really fail to see why this book has generated such raves. To be fair, the concept is brilliant, the prose exquisite, the descriptions spectacular. But where's the story? It's a collection of lovely scenes that fail to forward the plot or develop the characters. Add to that the incredible bouncing around in time, and it becomes very difficult to follow. Where was the editor in all of this mess? I listened to the audiobook with the incomparable Jim Dale wasting his considerable talent on this--and am so sorry I blew my own valuable time listening to the very end. I should have followed my instincts and dropped this pretentious garbage a few hours in.

And is anyone sick of his terrible plot.  Watching his movies are like reading Stephen King.  Lots of fluff and amazing pyrotechnics by no story, no plot.  He just be banned from movie making.  What was this movie about?  A monster is trapped on earth, and waits to the movie to be made to build a spaceship?  What?  Stupid.  Just plain stupid.  And by the way, the little vignette of a Super 8 movie of the title made by the kid main characters and shown at the end with the credits was far better than the stupid movie which preceded it.

B005LJK3AC|5.0|I saw this at a 2nd run movie theater and had no real interest in seeing the movie in the first place but at time there was little other options since I seen most of what was available at the movie theater. I sat down and was expecting to waste 2 hours of my time and 4 bucks. From the momement started to the ending credit I laughed, It is not in the same category as \\"Something About Mary\\" but pretty close. I laughed through out the movie, though my stomach never hurt but left the movie theater in a good mood and reommended it to all my friend. All of which also said it was a good funny movie. I recommend it, and give it two thumbs up and five stars.

B0011UBDTK|3.0|This review rates the following (in order):  Entourage  Rome  Californication  Spartacus  Weeds  Sex and the City  The Tudors  True Blood  Big Love  My wife and I have found that we enjoy these series better than watching individual movies.  I believe that we also would rank them in the same order, so this is a male/female friendly review.  As with all MoonDonkey reviews, it goes without saying that this is gospel.  I've tried to do this without including spoilers.  #1 Entourage (5 stars)  How could anything else be #1?  Entourage follows the career of movie star Vincent Chase and his group of friends.  This is the gold standard by which all other series are measured.  Plus, Entourage has the best one-liners of any series.  Unfortunately, I cannot include them in this review due to their graphic nature.    #2 Rome (5 stars)  Rome follows the exploits of two Roman soldiers - Verenus (the smarts) and Pullo (the brute).  Very well done.  For a historical drama, the sets are very well designed and believable.  In Rome, the idea is that you see the Roman Empire through the eyes of two soldiers as they experience the ups and downs of life.  My wife and I enjoyed this one a lot.  #3 Californication (5 stars)  Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this at first.  I pegged David Duchovny as an X-Files guy and wasn't sure what to make of him in this role.  Also, I wasn't sure what Californication was about anyway.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  In Californication, we follow the life and career of author Frank Moody - a chaotic and perhaps self-destructive individual who has a way with women.  Unfortunately for him, he is trying to balance the chaos of his life on one side with his teenage daughter and her mother (his love interest) on the other side.  The dude is a train-wreck and it makes for a great series.  #4 Spartacus (4 stars)  Spartacus is about a man who is captured and made a gladiator slave in the Roman Empire.  There is just of a bit of a drop off from the5 star series to 4 star Spartacus.  Why?  Well, there just isn't as much of Spartacus.  Basically one season followed by a \\"prequel\\" season.  I believe that is because the original Spartacus actor died of cancer.  I'm not sure if there are future plans for the series or not.  Also, the effects take some getting used to.  There is definitely a CGI feel to some of the scenery.  The blood effects are similar to 300.    Regardless of those issues, Spartacus was highly enjoyable.  Even my wife, who was like \\"what the heck\\" after the first episode, came around and really enjoyed the series.  Maybe because they show sausage.  Some of the gladiator \\"locker room\\" scenes are like staring at a pack of Johnsonville brats.  There is a lot of blood and nudity in this one - as there should be given that this is a brutal depiction of life as a slave gladiator.    #5 Weeds (3 stars)  Weeds gets a golf-clap 3 star ranking.  Why?  Because the plot just doesn't make sense sometimes.  There are points in this series where you feel like it is going one way and then - boom - the plot takes a 90 degree turn towards something else.  It's not like it makes sense thought.  Rather, it feels more like a different writer came in to write a different episode or something.  It is very strange and it happens a number of times.    Weeds follows the life of a suburban mom who sells pot to make money after her husband dies.  The decision to become a dealer impacts her two sons and her husband's brother - who comes to live with her.  The series starts out with sort of a realistic \\"how would this play in the suburbs\\" feel, but then progresses down some more eccentric paths.    We have enjoyed the series, but this is not one that we were waiting at the mailbox for the next video to arrive.  It qualifies as a \\"we will watch it when we get around to it\\" series.    #6 Sex and the City (3 stars)  Sex and the City explores the lives of 4 single women and their quest for happiness and men in New York.  Why 3 stars?  This is the only series that my wife and I would disagree on the ranking.  I suspect she would give it 4 stars and I would give it two.  Frankly, it is too much of a \\"chic flick\\" for me... and I would guess most men feel the same way.    Wait you say - what about Entourage?  Isn't that basically the same thing with a group of guys?  In a word... no.  It isn't.  For some reason, Entourage just plays better that Sex and the City.  Also, the last couple seasons of Sex and the City really fell off a cliff.  It had the distinct feeling that they were just looking to wrap it up.    Also, speaking as a guy, this series became too \\"cultish\\" for me.  Do you know how many women started drinking cosmos because of this series?  For that matter, do you know how many \\"Rabbits\\" sold because of this series?  Sex and the City became sort of a female cultural event.  Guys - that really tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it?  #7 The Tudors (3 stars)  This is a tough one.  The Tudors is a story about the life of Henry V of England and his many wives.  It is good, but I think many people just won't get into this series.  It doesn't have the craziness of Entourage or Californication, nor the blood and guts of Rome and Spartacus.  The Tudors is more of a historical drama.  Consider The Tudors a 3 star teetering on the edge of a 2 star.  I prefer Weeds to The Tudors.  However, I think my wife would maybe rank this a bit higher.  If you choose to watch this series, I strongly recommend committing to watching the first 3-4 episodes at least.  If you just watch one or two, you probably won't stick with it.    I tell you what though - one of the most interesting things about The Tudors is all of the torture.  Watching The Tudors makes any modern \\"torture\\" techniques look laughable.  Water-boarding?  Bah, that's for sissies!  Give me the rack!  #8 True Blood (2 stars)  True Blood is about life in a small town after vampires have come out of the closet and try to live normal lives with humans... or at least that is what it starts out to be.    Look - I'd love to rate True Blood higher, but the series just gets weirder and weirder as it goes on.  It is like the writers got bored with the standard vampire-human conflict thing so they had to take it in several other directions... and I do mean several.  Suddenly we have werewolves, witches, shape-shifters, fairies, etc, etc.  It gets to the point where you are asking yourself, really?  Really?    I'd give the first season alone 4 stars, but it drops of to 3 stars and then to 2 stars after that.    #9 Big Love (1 star)  Big Love is about a mormon family practicing polygamy.  The story follows the life of one man and his many wives.  My wife liked this a bit more than I did, but it just didn't do it for me.  There really wasn't anything about the show that I found interesting.  I think my wife enjoyed some of the relationship drama, but she stopped watching the series and hasn't expressed an interest in continuing it.  This one was a burn-out.  I think it is because Big Love is maybe too serious - if it had a Californication element to it, I bet it would have been pretty entertaining.  So there you have it my friends.  I may continue to update this list as we watch more series.  The nutshell is that HBO appears to be focusing on more high-end \\"production\\" type series and Showtime is focusing on lower cost dramas.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|This review rates the following (in order):  Entourage  Rome  Californication  Spartacus  Weeds  Sex and the City  The Tudors  True Blood  Big Love  My wife and I have found that we enjoy these series better than watching individual movies.  I believe that we also would rank them in the same order, so this is a male/female friendly review.  As with all MoonDonkey reviews, it goes without saying that this is gospel.  I've tried to do this without including spoilers.  #1 Entourage (5 stars)  How could anything else be #1?  Entourage follows the career of movie star Vincent Chase and his group of friends.  This is the gold standard by which all other series are measured.  Plus, Entourage has the best one-liners of any series.  Unfortunately, I cannot include them in this review due to their graphic nature.    #2 Rome (5 stars)  Rome follows the exploits of two Roman soldiers - Verenus (the smarts) and Pullo (the brute).  Very well done.  For a historical drama, the sets are very well designed and believable.  In Rome, the idea is that you see the Roman Empire through the eyes of two soldiers as they experience the ups and downs of life.  My wife and I enjoyed this one a lot.  #3 Californication (5 stars)  Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this at first.  I pegged David Duchovny as an X-Files guy and wasn't sure what to make of him in this role.  Also, I wasn't sure what Californication was about anyway.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  In Californication, we follow the life and career of author Frank Moody - a chaotic and perhaps self-destructive individual who has a way with women.  Unfortunately for him, he is trying to balance the chaos of his life on one side with his teenage daughter and her mother (his love interest) on the other side.  The dude is a train-wreck and it makes for a great series.  #4 Spartacus (4 stars)  Spartacus is about a man who is captured and made a gladiator slave in the Roman Empire.  There is just of a bit of a drop off from the5 star series to 4 star Spartacus.  Why?  Well, there just isn't as much of Spartacus.  Basically one season followed by a \\"prequel\\" season.

B004ZZS4CC|2.0|I hated, hated ,hated, this book. It's not that its written in the voice of a stunted young girl, and it's not the style of writing. It's more so that she really doesn't give any insight into the mind of the man who stole her and stole her life as a child. Everyone knows that Phillip Garrido is a sick man..that's a given. But Ms. Dugard's account almost makes it sound like she really didn't know this person for a span of 18 years.(Not a lot of info on Nancy either) She hints at some awful actions that he forced on her; she Hints and that is all.<br />I am so glad this young precious girl was found and is free from this life that was forced on her; I think all who know of her story feel that way. However, the point in writing and telling one's story is to share and teach others. Especially this type of story.<br />Kuddo's to her for making a new life for herself and protecting her two daughters. More power to her on that! The world will try and find out more about her children with this man and that will be hard for them all, I think. But as for the book, it does not reveal and expose this sick man and especially does not teach more of us out there what to look for and avoid...

Unfortunately, I cannot include them in this review due to their graphic nature.    #2 Rome (5 stars)  Rome follows the exploits of two Roman soldiers - Verenus (the smarts) and Pullo (the brute).  Very well done.  For a historical drama, the sets are very well designed and believable.  In Rome, the idea is that you see the Roman Empire through the eyes of two soldiers as they experience the ups and downs of life.  My wife and I enjoyed this one a lot.  #3 Californication (5 stars)  Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this at first.  I pegged David Duchovny as an X-Files guy and wasn't sure what to make of him in this role.  Also, I wasn't sure what Californication was about anyway.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  In Californication, we follow the life and career of author Frank Moody - a chaotic and perhaps self-destructive individual who has a way with women.  Unfortunately for him, he is trying to balance the chaos of his life on one side with his teenage daughter and her mother (his love interest) on the other side.  The dude is a train-wreck and it makes for a great series.  #4 Spartacus (4 stars)  Spartacus is about a man who is captured and made a gladiator slave in the Roman Empire.  There is just of a bit of a drop off from the5 star series to 4 star Spartacus.  Why?  Well, there just isn't as much of Spartacus.  Basically one season followed by a \\"prequel\\" season.  I believe that is because the original Spartacus actor died of cancer.  I'm not sure if there are future plans for the series or not.  Also, the effects take some getting used to.  There is definitely a CGI feel to some of the scenery.  The blood effects are similar to 300.    Regardless of those issues, Spartacus was highly enjoyable.  Even my wife, who was like \\"what the heck\\" after the first episode, came around and really enjoyed the series.  Maybe because they show sausage.  Some of the gladiator \\"locker room\\" scenes are like staring at a pack of Johnsonville brats.  There is a lot of blood and nudity in this one - as there should be given that this is a brutal depiction of life as a slave gladiator.    #5 Weeds (3 stars)  Weeds gets a golf-clap 3 star ranking.  Why?  Because the plot just doesn't make sense sometimes.  There are points in this series where you feel like it is going one way and then - boom - the plot takes a 90 degree turn towards something else.  It's not like it makes sense thought.  Rather, it feels more like a different writer came in to write a different episode or something.  It is very strange and it happens a number of times.    Weeds follows the life of a suburban mom who sells pot to make money after her husband dies.  The decision to become a dealer impacts her two sons and her husband's brother - who comes to live with her.  The series starts out with sort of a realistic \\"how would this play in the suburbs\\" feel, but then progresses down some more eccentric paths.    We have enjoyed the series, but this is not one that we were waiting at the mailbox for the next video to arrive.  It qualifies as a \\"we will watch it when we get around to it\\" series.    #6 Sex and the City (3 stars)  Sex and the City explores the lives of 4 single women and their quest for happiness and men in New York.  Why 3 stars?  This is the only series that my wife and I would disagree on the ranking.  I suspect she would give it 4 stars and I would give it two.  Frankly, it is too much of a \\"chic flick\\" for me... and I would guess most men feel the same way.    Wait you say - what about Entourage?  Isn't that basically the same thing with a group of guys?  In a word... no.  It isn't.  For some reason, Entourage just plays better that Sex and the City.  Also, the last couple seasons of Sex and the City really fell off a cliff.  It had the distinct feeling that they were just looking to wrap it up.    Also, speaking as a guy, this series became too \\"cultish\\" for me.  Do you know how many women started drinking cosmos because of this series?  For that matter, do you know how many \\"Rabbits\\" sold because of this series?  Sex and the City became sort of a female cultural event.  Guys - that really tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it?  #7 The Tudors (3 stars)  This is a tough one.  The Tudors is a story about the life of Henry V of England and his many wives.  It is good, but I think many people just won't get into this series.  It doesn't have the craziness of Entourage or Californication, nor the blood and guts of Rome and Spartacus.  The Tudors is more of a historical drama.  Consider The Tudors a 3 star teetering on the edge of a 2 star.  I prefer Weeds to The Tudors.  However, I think my wife would maybe rank this a bit higher.  If you choose to watch this series, I strongly recommend committing to watching the first 3-4 episodes at least.  If you just watch one or two, you probably won't stick with it.    I tell you what though - one of the most interesting things about The Tudors is all of the torture.  Watching The Tudors makes any modern \\"torture\\" techniques look laughable.  Water-boarding?  Bah, that's for sissies!  Give me the rack!  #8 True Blood (2 stars)  True Blood is about life in a small town after vampires have come out of the closet and try to live normal lives with humans... or at least that is what it starts out to be.    Look - I'd love to rate True Blood higher, but the series just gets weirder and weirder as it goes on.  It is like the writers got bored with the standard vampire-human conflict thing so they had to take it in several other directions... and I do mean several.  Suddenly we have werewolves, witches, shape-shifters, fairies, etc, etc.  It gets to the point where you are asking yourself, really?  Really?    I'd give the first season alone 4 stars, but it drops of to 3 stars and then to 2 stars after that.    #9 Big Love (1 star)  Big Love is about a mormon family practicing polygamy.  The story follows the life of one man and his many wives.  My wife liked this a bit more than I did, but it just didn't do it for me.  There really wasn't anything about the show that I found interesting.  I think my wife enjoyed some of the relationship drama, but she stopped watching the series and hasn't expressed an interest in continuing it.  This one was a burn-out.  I think it is because Big Love is maybe too serious - if it had a Californication element to it, I bet it would have been pretty entertaining.  So there you have it my friends.  I may continue to update this list as we watch more series.  The nutshell is that HBO appears to be focusing on more high-end \\"production\\" type series and Showtime is focusing on lower cost dramas.
B005AUWY90|5.0|Outstanding movie.  Great for the kids and adults.  Arrived exactly on date of release.  Fantastic service from Amazon!  I would recommend this movie to kids of all ages.
B002KAJ0AO|3.0|I really enjoyed this album.  The sound of the Backstreet Boys has matured.  Maybe not as many chart-topping hits as pervious albums, but still a solid sound.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I was looking for a new series and this is it.  Just download the next two ebooks and preordered the fourth.  I liked how Thea Harrison mixed the fantasy world with the real world.  Pia was a strong and smart character/herione.  And, you have to love Dragos and the Gryhons.
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|This was an enjoyable film.  The first movie was much better, but this was pretty good.  Good charachter development as well as wonderful costumes and good storyline.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Don't read if you haven't seen the movie or know the premise of the movie!<br />X-Men First class is a great comic book movie that I put above Iron Man but below The Dark Knight, which by far is the best comic book movie ever. I follow the comics of multiple characters and series, not religously but enough, and overall First class is a really good adaptation by Matthew Vaughn and Company of Stan Lee's and Jack Kirby's work. First Class is a good character study of the protagonist and antagonist relationship between Magneto and Professor Xavier showing their beginnings, their friendship and ultimately their differences of opinions on how to deal with Human and Mutant relations. It also fits in pretty well with Brian Singers first movie taking cues and scenes of Magnetos past but in the end it creates its own timeline for the Xmen MOVIE Franchise as a whole. The movie really worked well but I do have a major issue with the story which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I felt like the dissolving relationship between Magneto and Xavier could have been done better as I felt it was too quick and didn't show the strain on both of the men for what they and us the audience knew was inevitable. The climatic battle scene although heavily advertised was great to see but again too quick of a finale.<br />Now onto the picture and audio. I am watching the movie on a 1080p toshiba TV, Sony S550 BDP, yamaha receiver and 5.1 audio. The picture and Audio were great but the movie score didn't cause the same emotion as the Dark Knight did but it was crystal clear and the special effects came through perfectly like it was meant for HD which it was. I also watched it on a 720p TV, Sony PS3 and only stereo sound which was still great but I missed the 5.1 audio as I didn't hear everything like I could in 5.1.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|Fair Warning is great, but I think the first three are all better than Fair Warning.  And the commercial 1984 is better than Fair Warning.  But Fair Warning competes with DD.<br /><br />VH, VH2, Women and Children First, 1984 are the top 4 in order, and then Fair Warning and DD bringing up the rear.  All great, though.<br /><br />Original early Van Halen fans would never view Fair Warning as the band's \\"masterpiece\\" or a fan favorite.  If anything, the debut Van Halen is the \\"masterpiece\\" and fan favorite.  Moreover, in addition, the second album Van Halen II sold more than Fair Warning.<br /><br />As someone who grew up in the time, Fair Warning was purchased immediately upon or soon after released and a definite requirement, as with all Van Halen albums, but could not touch Van Halen I or II.  With that said, Fair Warning (and Diver Down) are great albums.<br /><br />While Fair Warning is a masterpiece (as is all of the Van Halen albums), received critical acclaim, and has the awesome hit Unchained (and also Mean Streat a great song), the vast majority of Van Halen fans would not view Fair Warning at \\"the\\" masterpiece or their favorite Van Halen album.
0345529057|5.0|Important to note that these are written for adults, content can be quite graphic and I wouldn't recommend for anyone under the age of 16 (as a 21 year old myself). With that being said, these are absolutely worth the read if you enjoy medieval/fantasy novels or are looking to try them out. The author does an excellent job with character development, though a bit overwhelming at the start of the first book. You should note that the title of each chapter is the character whose perspective that chapter is written through.
B00006JSS8|4.0|I am not a purist at all, but \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" from Songs in the Key of Life should be in the compilation.
098357670X|5.0|Without a doubt, this book belongs in the reference library of anybody interested in drawing caricatures and cartooning or just in capturing a likeness through exaggeration.  It is packed with easy to follow tutorials, clear explanations of the artist's methods, and written in the friendly and amusing tone that Tom Richmond regularly uses in \\"The Mad Blog\\". Highly recommended without reservations!
B005FVFWOI|5.0|This is another in a series of brilliant Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, No-Man, Bass Communion, IEM, solo artist, and music engineer extraordinaire) remasters/reissues. Let's see - the whole King Crimson back catalog (they're up to \\"Discipline\\" so far, with \\"Lark's Tongues in Aspic\\" delayed for some reason), Caravan's \\"In the Land of Grey and Pink,\\" and now \\"Aqualung.\\" Steven's also issued most of Porcupine Tree's catalog in 5.1 surround and is world renowned for his incredible talent creating subtle yet brilliant surround mixes. Recently, giants of the progressive rock world like Robert Fripp and Ian Anderson have noticed his talent and enlisted his services for these various anniversary editions.  It's important to understand these are not just reissues, or even simple remasters (just reworking the mix of existing media files, in whatever format/condition). No, Wilson remixes the albums, transferring the original studio tapes and then creating a new hi-resolution stereo mix using the latest technology, under the supervision of the creators of the music. He then uses this new stereo mix as the basis for the surround mix - so both sound immeasurably better than the originals. In essence, he brings the original tracks into the 21st century, using modern technology to overcome the limitations the musicians had to deal with decades ago, making the music sound the way they always intended it to sound. The result is nothing less than stunning.  Others have reviewed the tracks in detail so I won't bother, although I agree with the one reviewer who wrote that the previously unreleased long version of Wond'ring Aloud on the bonus disc is now his favorite Tull song. I always loved that song but wished it weren't so painfully short. This new version retains the poignant beauty of the original while giving the listener the satisfying listening experience I always longed for. That one song alone justifies this purchase - but the whole package is absolutely brilliant.  Also, I want to emphasize the high price tag should not deter anyone considering the deluxe boxed edition. It is worth the money - no hesitation. The vinyl contains the 2011 remaster and sounds phenomenal, both the mix and the dead silent, audiophile quality vinyl. The packaging is clever without being cumbersome (how many of you have expensive box sets you don't play because it's too much of a hassle to get the discs out of the multiple layers of packaging?). Finally, the book is amazing, from the band interviews, lyrics, studio notes from the original recording, etc. to the description of the process Steven Wilson used to transfer and then remix the album using modern technology.   Five stars isn't enough to give this brilliant album, so lovingly brought up to date and presented in multiple formats. Top remaster/anniversary edition of the year, or just top...period (although the KC remixes/5.1 anniversary editions are amazing, too).  Final comment - if you like this album, check out Porcupine Tree. If you aren't already a fan, you don't know what you're missing. They're my favorite prog rock band, ever, and I grew up on prog (I saw Tull live on the \\"Bursting Out\\" tour). Give Porcupine Tree a try - start with \\"In Absentia\\" if you like your prog dark and heavy, \\"Deadwing\\" if you want a more slightly more gentle introduction, or \\"The Incident\\" if you love long concept albums. Then buy everything by PT you can get your hands on. Enjoy!
B0055MBQOM|3.0|This thing is basically the \\"i1 Display Pro Lite\\" and much too \\"lite\\" for the money you save. Not a good value. If you're going to spend this much money then you might as well just spend another $70-80 and get the actual [[ASIN:B0055MBQOW Xrite EODIS3 i1Display Pro]]. Search for \\"Dry Creek Photo Display Calibration Hardware Capabilities\\" for more info.<br /><br />If you don't have a colorimeter (display calibration sensor) or spectrophotometer (for profiling printers and displays) at all yet, and you expect to do any printing yourself on your own printer, you may just want to get the [[ASIN:B00169N0BK ColorMunki Photo - Monitor, Printer & Projector Profiler]] and use that to profile both your monitor and printer, then get the full i1 Display pro later if you need something more accurate. Yes the ColorMunki Photo is significantly more expensive, but the thing is that you may end up buying it anyway when you get frustrated with the color inaccuracy of your printer and want to fix it, and then you'll want to sell your colorimeter if it's a low-end one. I managed to get my ColorMunki Photo for $375 after a $75 rebate, which is a pretty good price, so grab it up on sale if you can.<br /><br />The problem is, basically, that if you spend $200 on a colorimeter now instead of $450 on a spectrophotometer now, you won't be able to just spend another $250 for something to profile your printer. You'll have to spend $450 later and then you'll have spent $650 when you could have just spent $450 in the first place.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first read ths book year ago, it was only the second book in my 25 years of reading tha I could not put down. Truly -- I started reading it at 9pm and didn't finish until almost 2am -- and, I had class at 8! I admit that felt that Collins moved too fast during some scenes which would have benefitted from further insight into the characters. However, I am on my fourth reading of it, so maeof that what you will.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Una excelente serie, en una presentaci&oacute;n sencilla pero que presenta toda la primera temporada.<br />Un excelente audio y video, motivo suficiente para tenerla en la colecci&oacute;n.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I have loved Coldplay for a number of years and love and adore everything they have done and the direction that they are going in musically now. I am very much a loyal Coldplay fan, so let that be known before you continue reading. =)  I highly recommend that you listen to this CD all the way through, every track in order. When you listen to it, you'll see what I mean when I say that each track bleeds effortlessly into the next, particularly \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" into the quirkly upbeat \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" (the first and second tracks of the CD). If you aren't watching the little thing scroll across the screen as the song goes on, I swear that you would not even realize that a track change took place. This is also true for \\"M.M.I.X.\\" and \\"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\\". Going from \\"A Hopeful Transmission\\" to \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\" is a bit more obvious, but very much the same.   Although this CD is VERY different from even just the band's last two CD's, Viva la Vida and Prospekt's March, I still thoroughly loved and enjoyed this CD. Stand out tracks include: \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\", \\"Major Minus\\", \\"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\\", \\"Paradise\\",\\"Up in Flames\\", which is reminiscent of the song \\"Teardrop\\" by Massive Attack (the opening theme for the Fox TV show House).  \\"U.F.O.\\", \\"Charlie Brown\\", and \\"Us Against the World\\" are very much like Coldplay on their earliest studio albums, particularly Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head, than the other songs on the CD are. Still, they do embrace the new direction that the band is heading in.   \\"Princess of China\\", the track that features Rhianna,is delightfully interesting while being quite the leap from everything else that Coldplay has done thus far, in my opinion.  If you do not like the out-there, somewhat techno-y, electronic sort of direction that many artists are going in these days, you might not like this CD. If you are absolutely in love with Coldplay, you'll probably love this new direction that the band is goingin. =D
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I have to say I love Coop and an as many know this is one of his most beloved films. What I did not know is there was an extra about the real Alvin C. York, and how this movie got to be made. I find it stunning that I was not aware this was a true story; it makes the film even that much more enjoyable!! There is also a biography hosted by Clint Eastwood which was entertaining but it left me wanting more information, but it was fine!<br /><br />Anyone who loves Gary Cooper movies or War films this is a great deal!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|It simply gives you an IP address to enter as a URL on your computer and you can explore everything on a much larger interface with boxes to check for large cleaning of old docs. Very well done. (Note: At first I was frustrated because I didn't realize the last number string followed a colon rather than a period.)
B000EGF0NW|4.0|I thought the directness of the writing made the events less confronting to read about, without downplaying the horror of what happened, and also serving to underline the emotional aspect of Sebold's rape and her isolation. I think her story clearly speaks of how the rape altered her life and her attitude to those around her, as well as the attitude of others to her. Although she did not realize it at the time, it was ten years before she actually began any sort of healing and that struck me as the saddest part of her story.   Rape is awful, it shouldn't happen to anyone, and to me it is obvious that it will affect the core of who you are (Sebold talks of this as before and after, there is a clear line for her and nothing is the same after the attack - \\"My life was over, my life had just begun.\\"), as well your relationships with others, especially men, but I had never before fully examined what this would mean in terms of life choices and behaviour in the very long term.  Sebold's story made me do that.  The reactions of others also saddened me, it highlighted how insensitive people can be, how unthinking and also how insular we all are - only concerned with how things impact on us and the clear emotional boundaries that exist between those who have been victims of violence and those that haven't.  The line in the book that most struck me was \\"I share my life with my rapist. He is the husband to my fate\\" - it sums up the enormity of the impact of such an act and made me stop and think.   The line that resonated with me the most was \\"You save yourself or you remain unsaved.\\"

0451208706|4.0|This is one of my favorite Follett novels. I love the British pre-World-War-I setting, and I like the plot, which involves a Russian anarchist (Feliks) who wants to assassinate a Russian Prince who is visiting London. The plot is more complex than I've indicated, involving Lydia, who is married to Lord Walden, and their eighteen-year-old daughter, Charlotte. The complexity of the plot adds to the interest. The pacing of the plot is excellent, though there is a bit too much interruption of the main plot with backstory events.<br /><br />Several other reviewers of this book have complained that one must suspend disbelief over some major things in order to enjoy the story. For example, the reader must accept that aristocratic eighteen-year-old Victorian women knew absolutely nothing about sex, pregnancy, or birth. I don't find it difficult to accept this because I see around me, every day, eighteen-year-olds who may know everything about sex, pregnancy, and birth, but don't know other things that seem very common-knowledge to me, such as that Canada is a nation in North America. So I can accept the world that Follett has created and go along with the fast-paced story. I did feel, though, that the ending rushed along with more of an eye to drama than to probability, and this weakened my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />On another note, if you want to read Follett's first plot outline of The Man from St. Petersburg and compare it to his second plot outline, to see how he increased the stakes and tension in the novel, read Albert Zuckerman's book, Writing the Blockbuster Novel.
B003X5UDEW|5.0|I don't know much about martial arts or about China's history for that matter, but this movie was very enjoyable and well made. Educate and entertain-a combination few directors achieve or even aim for. The martial arts demonstration is something I have never seen before. It really shows the ART behind the sport. Amazing.
098357670X|5.0|Tom Richmond's \\"The Mad Art of Caricature!\\" takes the best aspects of the instructional \\"how-to\\" book - visual examples, explanation and theory - and goes above and beyond!! Like Preston Blair's \\"[[ASIN:1560100842 Cartoon Animation]]\\" book being the quintessential guide for, well, cartoon animation, surely Tom's is the caricature equivalent! I've been drawing caricatures professionally for nearly 7 years, and have been familiar with Tom's approach to his art throughout that time (thanks partially to his 'The MAD Blog' online, one of the BEST blogs around), but it's an absolute treat to finally see his take on caricature compiled into a solid 170-page book! Consider it the ultimate \\"behind-the-scenes\\" guide to drawing caricatures. It's divided into 9 chapters chock-full of FULL-COLOR drawings, paragraphs of USEFUL theory telling you IN GREAT DETAIL how to observe the human face (and body) in order to render it funny. Sure, there's other caricature books out there, but honestly (and this is coming from someone who relies on drawing funny faces to make a living), if you ever wanted to learn how to draw caricatures (or already do and want to improve on your craft), I really don't see how you could buy any other book besides this one. As I flip through these pages I realize I can start fresh and re-apply everything I've ever known, and instill Tom's vast knowledge into my own work which will definitely help me advance to a greater level over time!  Aside from being a perfect guide to caricature, it's flat-out HILARIOUS! Before I started reading it, I had to scan through it cover to cover a few times just to enjoy all of the great artwork Tom has drawn over the years. He's one of the best in the biz! So not only will it be there for inspiration, but for entertainment purposes as well! GET. THIS. BOOK!
B0000025DV|5.0|\\"Out Of The Blue\\"  #4  (1977).  Electric Light Orchestra was coming off their most successful album of date, 1976's \\"A New World Record\\", the album sold over 5 million copies.  Jeff Lynne went to the Swiss Alps and wrote this double album in 3 weeks and than traveled to Munich, Germany and recorded this in 3 months, amazing by today's standards.  This is their 7th studio album and most popular among the fans.  This would be the last album with cellist's Hugh McDowell and Melvyn Gale and violinist Mik Kaminski, who would appear on their \\"Secret Messages\\" album in 1983.  This album produced 4 top 100 hits.  As a junior in high school, I listened to this a ton, I loved about everything on it, but it does have a few stiffs.  After this album came out , I got the whole back catalog, (the rest is history 12 studio albums, 2 live albums and a  soundtrack later).  ELO toured in '77 and '78,  with their spaceship rig that looked more like a giant cheeseburger!  What a tour, it was a sellout shows everywhere, saw them in Kansas City, one of the best shows at he time, I remember hearing about the spaceship, one night it wouldn't open on one of there stops (very Spinal Tap).  This album is full of killer tracks in, \\"Turn To Stone\\", #13 a great track, the ballad \\"It's Over\\", #75, a most beautiful song in \\"Sweet Talkin' Woman\\", #17, Kelly Groucutt and Jeff Lynne do tremendous vocals on this track.  \\"Across The Border\\", reminds me of Mexico, with Mexican horns and guitar serenade.  Then you get the frenzied \\"Night In The City\\", the fun little song in \\"Jungle\\", the pretty little ballad in \\"Believe Me Now/ Steppin' Out\\",loved this song back in the day.  On the concerto for a rainy day, you get the upbeat \\"Standin' In The Rain\\", the acoustic orchestral sounds of \\"Big Wheels\\", great tune, the striking \\"Summer And Lightning\\" and the famous \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\", #35.  One of my personal favorites is \\"Sweet Is The Night\\", which should of been a huge hit, Groucutt and Lynne in top form, just can't beat this one.  \\"Birmingham Blues\\", about their hometown, great slide guitar rocker.  And the fun \\"Wild West Hero\\".  The only songs I didn't care for were \\"Starlight\\" and the instrumental \\"The Whale\\".  Again great album, Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan,  the late Kelly Groucutt, Richard Tandy, Melvyn Gale, Hugh McDowell and Mik Kaminski did wonders!

B006FE17Q6|5.0|With the character and plot development from the past few episodes, I was hoping for at least a decent payoff soon.  This episode delivered.  Well.  The themes of molding new definitions between life, death, loyalty, and humanity in this new world were all brought in from the previous episodes (okay, they were a little 'slow', but meaty in theme)and delivered a quick one-two punch at the end of this one.  Great to watch!!!

0321127420|2.0|Given the date this book was written, I understand the many positive reviews.<br />Offcourse we now are almost 2012 and 10 years of evolution in IT makes a vast difference which makes this book dated.<br />With today's ORM tools like JPA, (N)Hibernate, Torque, .. more than 50% of the book is irrelevant.<br />It might come in handy when we would like to create our own 'sort of' implementation of such tools, but why should we...<br /><br />The best way to look at this book is as if you were buying a Windows Millennium book for your windows seven OS.<br />Some things might seem helpful and maybe even are, but there is no good reason to spend 50$ or 40 on this.

0061784788|5.0|I usually am too lazy to write reviews, but I felt compelled to do this one.<br />I read some of the negative ones and saw that James Rollins was compared with Dan Brown.<br />This is insult to James Rollins!<br />Dan Brown should read his books to find out how to write one. Not to mention the time Rollins takes for a single novel, though this one took rather long, too, on the contrary to Brown whose books are getting worse and worse, Rollins delivers in the end.<br />I also read the negative reviews in regards to the advertised content. Who takes advertisements literally? There are countless examples for books and movies where the advertisement has hardly anything to do with the final product. As unfortunate as this is, it's obvious that most advertising has nothing to do with being honest to the reader or viewer, but only serves dramatization to boost sales.<br />I cannot say that this is the best Rollins novel that I read, but all of them are so good that I give this one five stars.
1451627289|4.0|This book is exciting and well worth reading.  It's like a trilogy.  An addendum is to view the life of what is now expected of America in these exciting times, seeking out the good things for a change.  I found the supporting literature about the American dream very encouraging as well.  I encourage the reading all good books.  [[ASIN:1466312645 Barack Hussein George W & The American Dream]]
B000O8OTNC|2.0|I tried this on my new Schrade skinning knife and it seemed to take the edge off more than anything. I tried it for probably 25-30 pulls on the carbide side and the knife was duller than before I started. I did 25 more pulls and not much sharper. I put it through the ceramic side hoping it was an odd burr making it feel dull, but it didn't really do much. I would go with an Accu-Sharp product next time. They seem to work much quicker and more reliably.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Really good movie . Didn't know Gwyneth could sing so well and the rest of the cast are just great. Story line is pretty common unfortunately in the music world with fame being ephemeral ... and I can see why they changed the ending. All round really enjoyed the film and have watched it several times
0471603864|5.0|I bought this book as an undergrad to help me survive with a first class in elementary particle physics. Today I am a Graduate student and I am still using this book for such classes as Elementary Particle Theory, Quantum Field Theory I and II, Nuclear Theory, even Relativity. Professor Griffiths wrote this book with an eye on the less skillful student who nevertheless has the desire to learn Particle Physics. So he does not let you wondering how things are derived, why a certain process takes place this way etc. It is a rich book in terms of worked examples. Also the collection of problems is excellent and some are really easy to work(and learn). So it won't disappoint the newbie in the field of Particle Physics!!
B005PR2FD8|4.0|This movie pretty is more for the fans of the game then anything else as if you've never played the game series you'll probably feel confused at what's going on and the reasons for the relationships between the characters.  The movie itself while giving us some cameos of other characters of the game will focus mainly on about six of them.  We have Anna and Nina Williams highly skilled mercenaries both while sisters definitely have a dysfunctional love/hate relationship which is minute compared to the Mishima family primarily Heihachi Mishima the father of Kazuya Mishima and grandfather to Jin Kazama the later two who possess the devil gene a power that increases their abilities almost infinitely though it also increases their feelings for destruction and while Heihachi doesn't have the devil gene he greatly covets the power.  We also have Jin's longtime friend who secretly(She thinks) loves him Ling Xiaoyu and the female android Alisa Bosconovitch who makes her appearance here though the only game she's on at this time is Tekken 6.  The movie is pretty much like another CGI movie based on another game Final Fantasy Advent Children, and like that one the story feels like it's just meant to give us more airtime for our characters from the game and shows what's been happening with them.  The CGI animation and soundtrack are superb and I greatly appreciate that the kept the Japanese audio track as while the English dub cast weren't bad some of the voices just didn't play out for the roles they were given.  So for $14.00 dollars I say this is a must have for any fans of the series,  and for those who've never played the game I still say for the action and overall entertainment of the movie I still say it's worth a look...

B000O8OTNC|5.0|For less than $10 you wont find anything better. This sharpener is great, portable and has multiple sharpening options. I have a 70 Spyderco sharpening system that I doubt will get much use, this thing really does the trick, only complaint is that because its so small and light, it makes gripping it firmly a bit more difficult, take in mind though I have large hands, so if yo don't its probably perfect.
B001FB55H6|1.0|I truly hate this movie. If you think the glorification of mediocrity is somehow an insightful portrayal of reality, you might like it. Boring & pointless.

B005POK858|5.0|just to clarify to those who are curious (like i was) about whether its an action or turn based rpg. it's turn based. kind of Chrono Trigger mixed with Final Fantasy 1 or 2 on the gba. i like it. wished some of the potions stuffs were cheaper. fun for nostalgic level grinders. after playing action rpgs its nice to return to my gaming roots. even if it means i only playing while waiting for my pc games to install.
B0036MDN80|5.0|I love this toy! You can rip out the baby but still put it back in the mouth of the mother. I like to pretend that there's a chase scene and the tigress is trying to save her baby. So if you get this toy for a child, or anyone, I'm sure they'll love it!
B005H5H3LW|3.0|There is no greater Starblazers fan than me. By \\"Starblazers\\" I mean the Quest for Iscandar and Comet Empire series that played back to back to back in America from the late 70s to the early 80s. This excludes the Bolar Wars and any later releases that were produced with different voice actors. Like many fans I got up early before school to watch Starblazers in the morning, and then sprinted home from the bus stop to watch it in the afternoon. And I dressed up as Wildstar for Halloween one year. Later I bought the entire VHS collection for both series that came out in the early 90s. I then upgraded to the DVD versions when they came out, handing down my VHS collection so my little brother could benefit from it. I even own a shrink-wrapped back-up copy of the 2 series on DVD \\"just in case\\". Maybe I'll hand it down to my grandchildren one day. Speaking of children, I named my first son \\"Avatar\\" and my second son \\"Venture\\", and started them on the series when they were 2 years old, and now they are huge fans, too. One year Avatar had a Starblazers-themed birthday party. If I had had 2 daughters I would have named them Tralaina and Nova. I have models of several spaceships, including a large Argo with moving parts and sound effects, and action figures.  Given my almost sacred devotion to the series, it did not surprise me that this first live-action production was overall a disappointment.  As a superfan I felt I had to give it a chance, and I figured it wouldn't be total crap so it was worth owning. I think my kids will enjoy watching it multiple times, but really it's a `B' movie by American standards.     The special effects aren't much better than you'd see in some of the bigger-budget, original movies on the Sci-Fi channel. They're also, in large part, too fast to fully appreciate. By \\"fast\\" I don't mean the action sequences were too \\"short\\". I mean the planes flew too fast, the missiles and lasers were too fast and messy. They were more like flashes on the screenthan engaging, suspenseful action sequences. The ground fighting scenes were better in this regard, though, and overall I'd give the special effects 3 out of 5 stars.  The writing and the acting, however, really brought the movie down. Frankly I think the cartoon is more emotionally engaging and less cheesy/corny. Of course, just like when fans as kids fell in love with the cartoon in spite of its cheesiness and corniness, kids today will likely not think much of the added cheese and corn in this live action production. However, the adult fan who was hoping the live action movie would improve on that aspect of the series will be disappointed. Maybe the writers did this purposely to try to make it more like the cartoon, or maybe this is considered `A' movie scripting in the Japanese industry. Not sure. As for the acting, Captain Avatar was probably the worst with Nova the best. Wildstar seemed to start out poorly but got better as the movie went on. The writing and acting I would give 2 out of 5 stars.  As for the screenplay/story, the writers did more than compress the 26 episodes of the Quest for Iscandar series into a 138-minute movie. They made significant changes to the plot, like changing the nature of the Gamilons, and merged elements of the Comet Empire series into the story, especially the end. The sex changes for Eager and Dr. Sane aren't too big of a deal, as well as the change to Wildstar's and Vetnure's back stories. But Homer was eliminated completely and the Space Marines brought aboard (that reminds me; I take back what I said about Captain Avatar being the worst actor, that distinction should probably go to Sergeant Knox). Major conflicts with the Gamilons such as at Pluto and Balan aren't even given screen time in montage form (which would have lessened the feeling of being \\"rushed\\" that other reviewers have complained about). Merging the battle at the Rainbow Galaxy in with the assault on the Gamilon homeland, however, was more forgiveable as a time-saver. As for IQ-9, I don't like what they did with his character for most of the movie, but that scene at Gamilon where he transforms into the form of IQ-9 we know and love, and then starts mowing down dozens of Gamilons with guns in both hands, that was AWESOME! Another thing I didn't like was the relative lack of emphasis on the ship. In the cartoon the ship is almost a character. Not so in this movie. Still the movie does pay homage to several story elements from the cartoon, even using nearly identical camera angles as the cartoon for some scenes.  One good thing I can say about the movie is the soundtrack. Much of the soundtrack is new, which was initially disappointing because the original music from the cartoon is largely what made the cartoon great and where it broke new ground. Never before had a movie-worthy score been written for a cartoon. They could have just re-mastered the old score and used it for the live action movie. However a lot of the new music is really good and has that Starblazers feel, even though some of it seems ill-timed. The cartoon was better about playing music appropriate for the scene. Still, I'd give the soundtrack 4 out of 5 stars, even though the DVD menu is ruined with that horrible pop song they put on there. The animated Starblazers DVDs have way better menus and bonus features, all backed by the original score.  So overall I think this movie is worth seeing once, especially if you are a superfan. But for those fans who have been waiting for Starblazers to be given the heavy, live-action treatment it deserves, you'll have to keep waiting. It's too bad Peter Jackson or someone like that isn't a fan. That's what this series needs: one 3-hour movie for the Quest for Iscandar series and one 3-hour movie for the Comet Empire series; both with top, Hollywood-caliber writing, casting, acting, direction, special effects, and score composition, and a more faithful retelling of the story. I've already got the screenplays in my head.But alas I don't have 100 million dollars to produce them.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I super like this game...drives me crazy just by playing with it ...whooooo.Y'all needs to experience this game, its very fun and entertaining...
B005RAO0GS|4.0|I should begin by stating that I am not a F&tM fan, I have not listened to any of their prior music.  I decided to give this album a listen just to see what all the hype was about.  What have I learned?  The vocals are outstanding, and I think few in the modern music scene can rival them.  The vocals alone are reason enough to listen to this album, I would highly recommend them.  Lover to Lover might be the highlight (in my opinion).  So why only four stars?  The album as a whole has a terribly overproduced sound.  Granted, this makes every instrument clear, and the mix is quite well balanced - I just think having a more raw feel would more fully complement the vocals.  Paul Epworth produced this album, and his sound is stamped all over it.  If you listen to Adele, Kate Nash, Cee Lo Greene, or Bloc Party you will find this album to have a familiar vibe to it.  Don't get me wrong, I think everything sounds great, but there is nothing novel or groundbreaking to the instrumental portions of the album.

B00004U8P9|4.0|I will start by saying that there is not a person who dislikes musicals more than I. That being said, I am in love with this movie. It came out well before I was born, and is a cult classic. My uncle is the one who got me hooked on this movie, and now I watch it quite a bit. I hope to attend a midnight showing of this movie soon, as they sound like a lot of fun. Even though I hate musicals, I believe that this is one of the greatest movies ever. Such a rollicking good old time, you will be entrenched in this movie and its characters. Once you watch it once, I guarantee that you will want to see it again and again.
0446547603|4.0|You'd think after reading many Nicholas Sparks books you could figure out when the story will completely flip on you, but you can never see it coming!  This book had exactly the right amount of suspense to keep me on my toes for hours.  Katie is a mysterious woman who moves to a small town to start over,  while no one knows her story she tries to keep a low profile but when relationships start to develop Katie has to ask herself if she is keeping a safe distance?  I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B005J7K964|5.0|I first saw Metropolis in a college class at the University of South Florida entitled, History of Horror Films. It was a great class. It was great seeing the original black and white on a big screen. Years later I came across the Moroder version on a VHS recording. Even though I absolutely loved the original - I fell in love with this version. I actually signed an online protest to get it on DVD. Maybe it did some good? I realize the soundtrack is outdated but music has a way of re-inventing itself. And to be honest with you....I don't remember listening to any of this music in the 80's. I was still stuck in the 70's and barely remember ANY 80's group - so this was all new to me. I think the sound selection is great. I got this DVD for my birthday and couldn't wait to watch it. It really isn't color but more like sepia. A few drizzles of red but mostly a muted tone. What I really like is the subtitles instead of the placards that were originally encompassing the whole screen. Big improvement. It you have a big screen, turn off the lights and crank up the volume you will enjoy it. Although the music will go from soft to blasting you out so have the remote ready-at-hand. I also thought the film reminded me of the protest on Wallstreet. In fact organizers would be wise to have this projected outside on a building on a cool winter night to see the relevance. But, of course, by projecting it onto a wall would require having an expensive projector which may put them into the 1%.

B00425S1H8|1.0|I am not sure how this product works on other operating systems, but as soon as I installed the driver (exactly how the instructions indicated) it slowed my PC running Vista down to a crawl.

B00012L786|3.0|I have previously in this space seemingly beaten to death the idea that not all crime noirs are created equal. Here I am again giving a thumbs down to this one based on that elusive standard. And here`s why. While most of crime noirs , those that have good or bad femme fatales to muddy up the waters or not, have crime, the solving of crime, and the message that crime does not pay built into their plot lines. The film under review here, Pick Up On South Street, however tries to combine crime with a political message, a 1950s Cold War \\"red scare\\" political message-don't mess with the reds or you'll be dead. Courtesy of one J. Edgar Hoover, and about a million other unnamed, unmourned anti-communists. Moreover, given the year of the film, 1953, it seems to have been specially created to kick dirt on the names of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg who were being executed for their efforts on behalf of the Soviet Union. But argument over that possible link is for another time.   Here's the plot line to give you an idea of how the two themes mesh (or don't mesh) in this film. A woman, Candy (played by Jean Peters), while riding a New York subway has her wallet pick-pocketed by one low-life grafter, Skip (played by Richard Widmark). Not big deal in New York City, except that the wallet contained, unknown to Ms. Candy, secret microfilmed documents headed overseas (to Uncle Joe, okay ) through (nefarious, of course) agents working here. Skip is not privy to what he has unleashed until Candy is ordered by one of the agents, someone who has \\"befriended\\" her, Joey (played by Richard Kiley), to get the damn thing back. Hence she finally winds up on South Street where in a run-down fishing shack Widmark hangs his hat. Through guile, sexual advance, and anything else she can think of she tries to get the microfilm taking more than her fair share of beatings in the process. No dice, for a while. Of course to tie the red scare theme together agents, and you know what agents, are on the caselooking out for the national interest. So the \\"win\\" is in the bag.Overall pretty thin gruel, right?   Right, except for Richard Widmark's self-dramatizing flare as Skip, and his duplicity. See once Skip does become privy to what he has he is ready to sell to the highest bidder, and it takes hell and high water, including some cooing by Ms.Peters to get him on the right side of the angels. And this is where the whole thing falls down a little. No self-respecting criminal (or certified lumpenproletarian to use Marx's term) is really going to go through hoops out of some patriotic fervor when he has gold right in front of him. Widmark and the cooing been-around-the-block Ms.Peters going off the deep-end for some patriotic reasons just stretches the imagination a little too far. But then you have to reach back to the old stand-by rationale of crime noir-crime, crime crime, or political crime, doesn't pay to learn the lesson put forth here. Got it.
B00466HN86|5.0|This movie moved me like none other before. What a great example for fatherhood! I think that's all that needs to be said.

Watch it and you'll know what I'm talking about.
0545123275|4.0|Like any good reader I made an assumption on the novel right after reading the first chapter, I assumed that the entire novel Shiver would basically be about Grace and Sam being unaware of each others existance (yes even at school) until the full moon or something silly like that. Sadly *plays worlds smallest violin* my assumption on the novel was one word: WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG!!! (Okay so maybe not one word as a sentance but it's still that one word). As it turns out, after reading the epilogue that will literally make your heart pound from the action that it starts with, I began to wonder why exactly she has no idea that the wolf who saved her watches her every summer.    Suddenly my head was swimming with questions: Why was it that he was only out and about every summer? Why hadn't Grace been turned into a werewolf after being bitten? These questions had me tearing my hair out at the sides! At certain points of the novel I will admit that I got bored, I would be reading and reading but for some reason I just couldn't get into it as much as I was hoping too (of course only at certain points). I did enjoy the fact that once I got into the novel it didn't take long for something to be tossed in the way of the story, jutting it out in a different direction.    One minute I would be thinking that everything would be alright for Sam and Grace, that is except for the impending seperation of the winter, then suddenly Steifvater would throw something else at me. Then just when I would believe that my questions would never be answered... she would throw a shocking twist into the mix that would end up being the answers to all of my questions!    I would reccommend this to anybody who wants to read a werewolf story with new changes on their usual folklore. Especially if they want a love story that I have to say was pretty freaking awesome! Now I'm going to use my bookworm magic and say that you are thinking that this sounds like something you want to read...!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I bought this CD with reward points from completing surveys, this is the best free belonging ever! This album is their best so far. I like the upbeat songs and the slow songs. My favorite song in the whole world is the romantic \\"Just a Kiss.\\"- I listen to that song so much on CMT and in the car, my three year old son sings along w/ it!  I love how they sound together too. Wanted you more is especially good and I like Friday night too.
B005I6EVUG|1.0|This lovely cover does not fit the Kindle Fire. Once it's on the KFire, the spine is too narrow to close, leaving the KFire screen itself unprotected unless you lay something on top of it, which is not recommended.  When the first cover we ordered did this, we ordered a replacement. The spine of that replacement was only slightly wider, and still would not close enough to protect the KFire screen.  It's a shame, because it's a beautiful and fun cover.
0761166173|5.0|My boys (3 and 4) and I love this book in the nice big size!  We have been fans of Sandra Boynton books since their birth and this one doesn't disappoint.  As always, the rhymes and characters are addicting.
B003L77GG0|2.0|As a long-time Smallville fan, the last season wrap-up of this decade long series is somewhat disappointing. A few stand-out episodes pepper the season early on and Erica Durance's Lois Lane charms us through and through.  However, fans who loyally waited for Clark to get the suit and finally fly under the colors of his heroic destiny will be sorely disappointed.  The obvious \\"blue-screen\\" effects and the fact that Clark was in costume for what was probably less than 8 minutes at the end of the final episode suggest that the creators of the series begrudgingly gave fans what they were clamoring for -- and only at the last moment.  Other plot and character inconsistencies abound. The last season has a few golden moments, but they're planted like Easter egg gifts among an otherwise limited vision of one of our most enduring American heroes.
B006470HZ6|4.0|It is slow.  It is talky.  The ground covered in the first seven episodes could, and should, have been covered in three.  \\"Walking Dead\\" isn't just the title of the series, it's an accurate description of its pacing.  I think they are deliberately adding lots of dialogue as a filler  --the actors get paid the same no matter how many lines they speak-- which saves AMC money (Frank Darabont, the director of season 1, was fired, apparently after arguments about budget cuts, and I can see why he'd argue now).  The cuts are pretty obvious, with almost no special effects and relatively scant makeup work, which is, I imagine, why we see so few zombies in a zombie movie.  And filming everything on the same location saves loads of money as well, thus we are stuck on Hershel's farm.  The show is still worth watching because of the acting and solid writing, but if it drops another notch in quality, if they penny pinch any more, it won't be.  They're walking a fine line, as it were.

B0001I55SS|5.0|If you have never seen this, please ignore the savagery of some of the other reviews here.  Yikes!  Seems like a lot of folks reviewed this after seeing it for the first time somewhere in the 2000s, or watched it for the first time since they saw it as tots when it came out in 1979.  Well, there's certainly no harm in that.  However, it's really not fair -- or useful in a review -- to expect this film to do any of the following:  1. Live up to modern special effects standards (1979...)  2. Feature bloody horrorshow moments with spleens flying off in every direction (it was a Disney film!)  3. Zip along at the (often pointlessly) rapid-fire pace of modern action movies (1979!)  4. Look fantastic on DVD when there was clearly no real effort to make that happen (sigh)  It would be nice to see a completely top-notch DVD release of this movie, complete with archival material, PDFs or galleries of the various movie cards, storybook stuff, and so on produced at the time (Disney marketing being what it was/is), extra surviving footage where relevant, and most of all, a cleaned up, digitally scrubbed picture that compensated for the unforgiving clarity of DVD/Blu-ray releases by painting out any revealed wires or so on.  Don't hold your breath -- the movie didn't fare well when released and has never been treated kindly by its owners.  So if the 2004 DVD version is too clear for its own good, remember that this wasn't something the makers could have anticipated.  I saw this film several times in the theatre and have seen it about 60 times on BETA, VHS, and DVD collectively -- and I've never really noticed wires or the like.  If this really bothers you, buy a copy of the older DVD release, which is even lower resolution...  As for the slamming of the dialogue, I really don't see the point.  The film is at least 50% gothic castle horror, complete with a castle in the form of the main control tower of the Cygnus.  This is consciously rendered in the film in a fitting noir style.  What's another film convention that rides along with such a style?  Melodrama, and that idea informs the dialogue.  While some of the lines might feel flat, there's some witty material here, and there are no real standout flop lines.  Compare this to, for a peripheral example, the dwarf-tossing gag in Lord of the Rings (Fellowship), which is a line that momentarily pulls you right out of the movie with its cheesiness.  LOTR is great, must watch/must own stuff and isn't ruined by even that sort of inane writing, so why all the depth charges lobbed at *this* old film, which has nothing half as silly in it?  It's melodrama, and usually rather intelligent melodrama, and if it isn't up to Shakespearean snuff, just remember that wasn't the point.  The question is this: does it distract?  If not, no worries.  If so, perhaps you are looking for a different sort of movie.  If so, fine, but don't fault The Black Hole for having a script that actually fits its own style.  The other thing I've found perplexing about some of the reviews here, including the heartless, humorless review welded to the product description, is the razzing the end of the film receives.  It's all visual, no dialogue, and therefore is slammed as a ripoff of 2001.  If this film weren't SF, would an all-visual end have been pegged as a 2001 ripoff?  If the whole film really *was* set in a terrestrial gothic castle, what then?  Considering the pressures faced by moviemakers to deliver easily-digested, nod-along fare (especially when working under the thumb of a company like Disney), the end of this film is fascinating, daring, and inventive.  It's about the duality of the human spirit -- the \\"villain\\" is surely deserving of a hellish fate, and yet it's his creative, curious spirit of genius that guides the crew to safety.  And yet it isn't a neat little snapshut ending -- *where* are they, anyway?  Will they get lucky and find out they can actually live on the planet you see at the end?  Nice stuff.  Sure, I've always found some moments to be rather goofy -- when are they outside the ship?  When are they not?  That gets wacky at the end, to say the least.  How does the not-so-good doctor figure out nifty mind control tech?  Why is the Cygnus so huge?  Why, exactly, are these characters so good at shoot-'em-up fighting?  The let's-rescue-the-damsel moment is perhaps a little *too* gothic-horror (and it's the one time the music tries too hard in an elsewise well-matched soundtrack).  If I'd written the screenplay, I'd have insisted on sorting this stuff out, too, just like some of the one-star reviewers here.  However, the whole concept of diving into a black hole to go see what's on the other side is a fanciful leap, and should be treated as such.  By extension, similar consideration should be given to the movie.  There's enough passable shipboard science at work on the Palomino to satisfy the nitpicker, but once that craft gets to the \\"castle\\", as it were, gothic fantasy takes over.  People have compared this movie unfavorably to the original Star Wars movie, saying it was an attempt to cash in, etc.  Okay, clearly the success of Star Wars made other movie houses interested in the genre.  Fine.  Go back and look at most of the dreck that came out in the wake of Star Wars -- unless you're into watching so-bad-it's-good movies for heckle value (I'm looking at you, Roger Corman), you know this stuff is awful.  Actually, I love the so-bad-it's-good paradigm (so thanks for some good laughs, Roger Corman), but I also realize those crummy movies made it harder for the good stuff to be properly recognized and appreciated.  There's no way you can put this film in the same category as rubbish like Star Crash or Space Raiders or so on.  Maybe you'd get more entertainment, heckle-style, out of those movies and their ilk, but you can't equate The Black Hole with them any more than you can equate Star Wars itself with them.  Are the laser blasts dated?  Go watch SW.  Are the robots cute/hammy/etc?  Go watch SW.  Does physics take it on the chin sometimes?  Um, seriously, go watch SW, where all the action is *consciously* based on WWII footage and so on.  (Yay!  Diving and banking in space!  \\"Laser swords\\" [that's what Lucas calls them, folks] that, erm, just *end* at blade length.  Et al...)  Do these things make Star Wars a stinking pile like, say, Battle Beyond the Stars?  No!!!  Star Wars completely rocked because it *was fantasy* and allowances were made for its stylized depictions.  It still rocks because when you watch it, you forgive it for having to be made sometime, and that sometime was the 70s.  So if high-flying Battle for Britain/Midway/etc. dogfighting, cheeky droids, and inconsistent mystical shenanigans stylistically fit the concept of heroic fantasy for Star Wars, then a sense of mad-scientist noir plus some Star Wars-esque 70s trappings shouldn't detract from The Black Hole.  Blasting this movie for it's time or style is like blasting, say, The Dark Crystal because the characters' mouths aren't always that mobile, or because the Gelfling race is scientifically doomed to deformations and so on if only the two characters are left to repopulate the species.  I'd put that film up against 99% of the dross populating any of the genres in which you care to place it, then or now; I think the same of The Black Hole.  So if you've never watched this movie before, just imagine a time when there was only one Star Wars movie, its knock-off clones were laugh-aloud awful, there weren't eighty zillion dollar special effects zap-fests coming out by the diaperload every summer, there was no instant movie watching/spoiling/reviewing/fan-editing/etc. on your computer or phone or combination phone/reader/toaster or whatever, there were 13 channels on TV and maybe half of them broadcast something (and if you missed it, tough), (and, well, there was no Amazon or any other place like it for people to write long counterargumentative reviews likethis one!)  Imagine being hungry for some decent space opera/science fiction.  Now imagine hearing about a sci-fi film that *didn't* try to just knock off Star Wars or talk down to you every three seconds about the plot.  Imagine you can bring (within reason) your family to it because it isn't Alien-style dark (i.e. loaded with grubby characters that curse like sailors right up until their sticky, graphic end), but it's still dark enough to be interesting.  Imagine just sitting down and enjoying a good cast in a well-visualized movie full of style, atmosphere, and action -- all with a visually mesmerizing, thought-provoking ending.  Doesn't that sound, in context, like a good time?  I'm glad my family thought so in 1979, and I'm perfectly happy watching it now.  If you can use your imagination this way, or in general, maybe you might as well.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|Run out of ideas for your next album? Give Brian Eno a call and then you can have a wonderfully bland album.  This album was so disappointing on so many different levels.
B002CSC5EC|4.0|Good behind the scene footage and some great performances.Some great interviews with local citizens and business owners. Cool to see folks like Janis Joplin & The Who perform.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good game. A lot of fun. Is this the required minimum number of words yet? No? This should do it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Picked up this headset from Amazon.  First few hours were kind of bad since they had crackling during sound output.  Somehow this was fixed on its own though, as the problem disappeared.  Now it has amazing sound, no wires, and I couldn't ask for more.<br /><br />Got this for Vent gaming on TOR.  We'll see how it holds up to that.
B004FOA84A|4.0|this is a great game ,a little short but lots of fun. I really enjoyed it after I was done my children took a crack at it ,kept them quiet for a couple of hours
B005V20JKI|3.0|Buttons way too small.  Great idea but mechanics need a lot of work.  Why do I have to switch characters after every muffin?
B0050CJNJ2|2.0|I like their music but some of the songs were not what I thought.. but the hit songs are worth buying it.. I liked some of the songs but I think it would have been better if they put some hits on it...
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I loved this movie. It keeps you on edge the whole movie and it just seems too much like real. It was worth my whole $8.50 that i payed to see it. I cant wait till it comes out on DVD so that i can be maybe the first, but surely not the last one to buy it. Great Family Movie, some parts might scare the little kids, but they'll toughen up. LOL
B004LZFWJO|3.0|I got this on a whim when it was the free app of the day. The sound effects are very annoying, but it's almost impossible to play without them because they are sound cues to what's happening on the screen. Even on my 10\\" tablet, the screen is just a bit too small for my fat 'elderly' fingers to effeciently navigate diagonally, which  slows me down just enough to frustrate me. Maybe using a stylus would help. Otherwise, it is addictive in a 'I know this is really bad for me but it gives me just enough positive feedback to keep me hooked' kind of way. I just can't play it when anyone else is around because the noise drives everyone nuts.
B0052VI2YS|5.0|I love this album and love Deep Purple!  More than that I love it in 5.1 SACD!  I used to listen to it in Quadrophonic back in the day.  It uses the power of 5.1 very well.  Sounds almost as good as Deep Purple playing live at the California Jam in the 70's and the sound moving between those 4 towers.  It is a little loud & high pitched in the center speaker (had to turn the center channel down)
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version is almost exactly like the pc version. I havent found anything wrong with it yet. Definitely worth a try.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This CD/DVD is AMAZING! If you are an Adele fan, this is a must have for your collection, it plays like her greatest hits. My only complaint would be I didn't like the packaging, the inside wouldn't slide out and I had to rip the outer shell of the packaging, but even that was kinda worth it for the prize inside!!
B005GYY0GA|3.0|I really wanted to like this album, have been a fan of winters for a long time. The guests are first rate and the production is solid, but there's no soul in the recordings. This is Blues Lite.
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|No surprises in this impressive Disney offering. Exceptional animation, very professional musical numbers and a by the numbers story. Girls meets boy, girl and boy clash, girl and boy work together for common goal, girl and boy fall in love, girl and boy live happily ever after. Like I noted, no surprises.<br />Reasonably strong female characterization but still a significant amount of silly but sweet traditional femininity.<br />Most notable characters are Mother Gothel(not actually evil queen/wicked stepmother but for all intents) and Maximus the horse who behaves as much like a faithful pooch as a faithful steed.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Absolutely amazing concert without using special effects, but the wonderful voice and personality of Adele, I assure you will not regret buying this DVD. Adele is an extraordinary artist will give a lot of talk in the coming years. Only one word to describe this concert ... \\"awesome\\".
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Came on time! In good shape, and not to mention I love this movie! Thank you very much! I would recommend this product to others who enjoy a good movie.
B000002C4J|1.0|The reason for which I am giving this album one star is because Celine does not, in any way, challenge herself (even if that means losing a predictable fanbase).  Her first four English albums were pleasant with an even balance of dance up-tempo numbers and ballads that stir the emotions pleasantly (unforgettable WELL-PRODUCED BALLADS)!  This album is too bland and too boring.  To say this is elevator music is unfair.  Elevator music is far more enjoyable than this.  I do think Celine can sing.  I think those of you who say otherwise are lying.  She does have talent but what she does with that talent doesn't translate well with the music buying public.  I'm thankful I did not buy this; instead buy Celine's French albums (because for some reason or another, she SHINES on her french recordings...maybe because french is her maternal language, she expresses herself better in French...this is possible).  She also should not translate her French songs into English, re-record them and put them on her English albums.  She should simply write different songs entirely for her french and english recordings.  The translated versions of popular French songs, turned into English sound forced and contrived!  Please support her French works: Incognito, Dion Chante Plamondon, D'eux, D'elles, S'il Suffisait D'aimer, etc.  You won't be disappointed and her voice seems far more melodic and pleasant.    On this album, it seems like her high notes are forced; there is no emotion.  I think female singers that have emotion are usually the ones that have led harsh lives and they don't necessarily hit all the right and/or high notes.  Aside from \\"To Love You More\\", and the ever popular Titanic song (which I personally strongly dislike)...I really don't like this album.  ONLY FOR THOSE THAT ARE DIE-HARD FANS!!!  I still admire and respect Celine as a person and for having the courage to follow through on her dreams despite what others have said, done and/or put her through.  That much respect- she does deserve!  Thankx
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really like this game and the fact that it gives you an option to auto complete . It would be great if I could afford the ad free version.
0385535139|5.0|One of my favorite authors, John Grisham, has done it again as we meet Oscar Finley and Wally Figg, two middle-aged lawyers in a seedy section of Chicago. The guys call themselves a \\"boutique law firm\\", implying they're exclusive and stylish, but actually they're ambulance chasers, who get most of their money from DUI's and quickie divorces, with an occasional car accident thrown in. They barely scratch out a living and are constantly at each other's throats, when suddenly everything changes. David Zinc, a young, burned-out lawyer from a prestigious law firm, quits his job, gets roaring drunk, and literally ends up on Finley and Figg's doorstep.<br /><br />Not having much choice David joins the firm, just as they get a crack at a really big case. A huge pharmaceutical company has been pushing a drug that supposedly helps people lose weight but many people taking it have died, and Finley and Figg suddenly get a chance to join a gigantic torts law suit. Happily the suit doesn't require much work and might bring them millions, and here the fun begins. Grisham treats us to a lot of courtroom shenanigans and nail-biting suspense in his usual fashion, and provides a surprising but satisfying ending.
1451627289|5.0|I've read a lot of Stephen King's stuff and have a sort of love-hate relationship with his books.  He's done some absolutely brilliant work such as \\"The Stand\\" and \\"Christine,\\" but after working my way through the Dark Tower series, I was put off of his writing for awhile.  I know many people liked the Dark Tower books, but I found the later volumes to be meandering, interminable and flat, with characters I was starting to get annoyed with.  I stayed around to the end because I had invested so much time in the series already that I needed to find closure.    But in this newest book, \\"11/22/63,\\" King has hit his stride again.  It's a first-rate time travel story and I'm a sucker for those, if they are done well.  It's also a love story, a mystery, and a thriller.  It's a time travel book, but it's about so much more than time travel.  It has many of King's signature touches, including allusions to alternate realities, odd secondary characters from those realities, and connections to some of his other stories.  I especially thought the central characters had depth, were people I developed deep sympathy for, and that they really carried the story.  I should also add that, as fantasy-laden as the idea of time travel is, King makes it plausible, and does a great job of evoking memories of the 1950s and 1960s, an era which I still remember well.  One of my concerns as the book progressed was that I would be able to predict the end - a sure sign to me that the author hasn't shown much inventiveness or creativity.  But King beat me badly on that score.  With the exception of one or two elements of the ending, I was pretty well outfoxed.  But (without giving anything away) one of those elements was probably unavoidable and the other was necessary to close the circle.    This is King at his best I recommend it to anyone who enjoys time travel stories, or who has been put off by other King stories and is looking for redemption.  This one was 849 pages and I was hooked from page 1 - could hardly put it down and had to get to the end as quickly as I could.  I was not disappointed.
0446547654|1.0|BLAH! UGH! BLECHHHHH!  Ghosts, contrived plots, superfluous violence and absurd coincidences.  DUMB dumb dumb.  Nick: go back and reread The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, Dear John, Nights in Rodanthe. Study them, Nick. You used to know how to write.  Try again.  You are losing it, buddy. Give up the ghost theme of your last few books. It's not working. We read your books for a good love story, not to be duped by the paranormal.
B006ANJ4BW|5.0|Seriously, Jason Momoa, most recently of Game of Thrones fame (actually, that is all i ever have seen in him, lol), makes a great Conan. The pacing is spot on and true to the original movies, although i suspect the story is more in line with the comics and less in line with the books. Cant say for sure, as i haven't read either in 20+ years now (although now that i have typed that, i am reminded that i need to go back and do so again).<br />What i liked about the story itself is that they developed young Conan, showing how his father raised him (played bt Ron Perlman btw), and how Conan ended up as the last Cimmerian.<br />The rest of the story was okay, and the primary nemesis was pretty awesome, but what really shines is of course...the action. The swordfights and mysticism, the scenery, and just the overall depiction of the world was really cool. They clearly plan on making several more movies, which is great IMO, especially since the original two movies left me wanting more for more than twwenty years. Hopefully, we wont see a repeat of a franchise being dropped and forgotten about by movie makers.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B002VWNID6|5.0|I like this movie and went to Amazon and found it and bought it. The movie came in a coupal of days. I do alot of Amazon buying because of the price and I know the quality is there and with fast delivery, who could ask for any thing more.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|EDIT:  This review was edited after seeing and reviewing the extremely overcharged [[ASIN:B007FSEAHY Harry Potter Wizard's Collection (Blu-ray / DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)]]<br /><br />First of all, let me say I am a huge Harry Potter fan and was looking forward to a complete box set of the extended edition blurays. This is not that collection.<br /><br />To be fair, the movies themselves all warrant 5-stars. This package is nice for fans who just want the regular movies and don't care about all the extras.  But most diehard fans want more than that... the additional scenes, the deleted material. Give us Hogwarts the way it was meant to be!!<br /><br />I am altering my rating to three-stars because I see the need for this collection, but would still like an extended version.  To me, this product is still incomplete and I cannot recommend it for true fans.<br /><br />Please put the magic back into Harry Potter... =(
630562285X|5.0|I looked at many sights and found the right price at Amazon and I bought it. It came in just a few days and I have enjoyed it very much. I'm looking forward to other movies to buy in the future.

B005L38QHA|3.0|I bought this mouse and tried to use it however my hands could not get a proper handle on it.  This mouse has great features such as being made to work with World of Warcraft, setup macros, change button configurations, and even adjust an LED light if you want.  I was able to setup the mouse with no problems; I was able to have all the buttons I use on the keyboard transfered to the mouse, which in theory means I could play the game with only one hand.  As I said I had to return the mouse because it is rather small in size which I am sure some people will not mind.  This is a good mouse with many features for World of Warcraft which is the reason most will even look at this mouse.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I'd read Kaui Hart Hemmings' excellent novel once I heard that it was Alexander Payne's newest project.  It seemed the perfect Payne vehicle: small enough to tell in whole without stripping out key parts (it's notable that Hart Hemmings' work started its life as a short story), featuring a flawed (though not deeply) protagonist at the heart of the story.  Piling this success on top of 'Election,' 'About Schmidt' and 'Sideways,' I can only say: this guy needs to work more.  I can't believe that he waited seven years after the brilliance of 'Sideways' to deliver another gem like 'The Descendants.'<br /><br />George Clooney has never been better than he is here as Matt King (though I thought his work in the title role as [[ASIN:B0014B8KSI Michael Clayton]] was superb).  He is (as widely quoted in the trailer) 'the backup parent.'  Now, with his family suddenly reeling from a tragic event, King is thrust to the forefront - primary caretaker of two daughters who grew up quickly under his nose - right at a critical professional juncture in which he needs to make a critical decision about his family's stake in large swathes of Hawaiian lands held under their trust and jurisdiction.  How King (and Clooney) handles those two rapidly evolving matters is the crux of the story.<br /><br />Whenever you read a book and then see the movie, you can't help but compare...<br /><br />What I liked...<br /><br />Shailene Woodley - She is stunningly good as older daughter Alexandra.  It's an awesome portrayal.  She's supposed to be model beautiful (check), a bit of a screw-up in her past (the movie gives a nod to that) and - to her father's surprise - a lot tougher and mature than he thought at event's outset.  In every scene with Clooney (and there are many of them), she's every bit his equal as a presence<br /><br />Hawaii - Hart Hemmings' is Hawaiian, so she doesn't spend a lot of time discussing what makes Hawaii Hawaiian.  Payne needs to do that for his wider audience.  He does so deftly - at the opening in King's voice over in which he tells you that living in Hawaii is not like living in paradise (they have their own concerns like everyone else), in a scene in which they go to look at their property \\"for one last time,\\" in the houses and neighborhoods he shows (most modestly middle class).  This is the Hawaii of its residents, not its tourists.<br /><br />Other casting nuggets - Laird Hamilton as Troy (sounding reedy and borderline pathetic as you would expect someone in that situation)...brilliant choice; author Hart Hemmings tucked into a little Easter Egg as Matt's secretary...loved that; Matthew Lillard (Shaggy!) as Brian Speer...an unexpected choice, but pulled off very well indeed (his frozen face when confronted with King is perfect); Judy Greer as Julie Speer (was Payne casting due to the name rhyming?)...always a scene-stealer in supporting roles, she's great here again<br /><br />Pushing the the wife's story into the background - Here was the major script choice made by Payne: in the book, we come to know a lot more about Matt's wife (she's 'Joanie' in the book, 'Elizabeth' on screen).  We learn that she and Matt were vastly different.  The boating accident that put Joanie in the hospital is very representative of the way she lived her life: loud and and way up on the risk-o-meter.  One passage the stuck with me in the book.  A restauranteur tells him that he \\"liked when Joanie came because her presence encouraged everyone to drink more.\\"  We learn about Joanie's personality in Matt's remembrances (the book is first-person from his perspective).  Payne could have done the same by going back in time and showing them together as a couple.  He chose not to do that.  I think the movie is better for it.  First, he's got two hours to tell a story that unfolded in print over almost 300 pages.  Second, the movie works better with Matt needing to go it alone...he can't be helped by his wife. Her near-lifeless presence brings that home.<br /><br />What I didn't like...<br /><br />Matt and Joanie/Elizabeth's relationship - They're depicted here as having been mutually unhappy (the words \\"ask you for a divorce\\" are mentioned at least three times).  In the book, it's more nuanced.  They were, right from the start, very different.  But Joanie \\"always came home with me.\\"  It was a marriage of opposites that - despite what outsiders might have seen and felt - worked.  Or, rather, always had.  That's why the revelation about his wife and Speer stung so deeply.<br /><br />Sid - In the book, Alex's friend Sid is a steady stream of surprise to Matt.  He writes him off at the outset as shallow.  Turns out, he's anything but.  In movie, there's a hint of that.  In the book, it's better: it's Sid that calls Julie Speer to the hospital.  In the movie, Julie says she could \\"smell it on [Brian]\\" (after Matt and Alex's visit). In the book, she relates that \\"Sid told me.  He called the house yesterday.\\"  Matt's response: \\"Sid,\\" I say.  Well.\\"  You can feel Matt's respect go up immensely with that one small scene.  I liked that Sid was instrumental in letting that key moment come to pass.<br /><br />All in all, those are small quibbles.

B000L212HC|2.0|and uglier brother of the illusionist.  Not worth a dying man's hour to watch, and certainly not worth the purchase price.
B005P89F1C|3.0|Interesting album, but I wish there would have been a few more known/traditional songs on the album.  Excellent additional artists on the album!
B002DQLGHU|5.0|I watched this movie a decade ago when it first came out, and just watched it again with the family, after having already seen all of the other movies in the series.  I would say that this first movie is easily still the best.  Unlike the increasing darkness of the sequels, this movie mixes the scary parts with a certain cheeriness.  There's a genuine sense of wonder and excitement, drawing on so many elements of British culture and history, and we get to experience it vicariously through Harry.  And of course the special effects are also excellent, even after all these years.  Highly recommended, and suitable for everyone above about 10 years old.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|Great app, very easy to use and definitely a fun way to meet people wherever you go :) I travel a lot and I use it to meet new people locally. This app has truly helped me to make new friends and give my travel experiences a local flavour! Love it! Thank you Badoo!!

Also, someone hires a professional killer to go after and kill Rock. Both Rock and the professional killer are passionate about killing. How could Rock who is black be the brother of a white man? Is Rock going after the real killers? Who informed the killers where Rock and the gang were hiding? Why were they set up? Who hired the professional killer and why?
0060873027|3.0|As usual with a Crichton novel the story starts out with an intriguing scientific possibility extrapolated into an adventure. In this case it is shrinking people to near microscopic size. Lots of potential here, especially with 7 initial characters involved. But despite all the interesting science and the human tensions involved all the characters ultimately prove one dimensional at best.   I stayed pretty engrossed with the action hoping for the best but at the end I just felt cheated by the absence of any satisfaction or any sort of investment with the main characters. In fact, it felt like the next page would read, \\"Look for the next installment coming soon to a book seller near you!\\"   With Crichton you didn't always get a lot of warm fuzzy feelings for the main characters but at least you could identify with them enough to feel some sense of closure at the end of the story. In this case my reaction was \\"Huh, that's it?\\"

1451648537|3.0|If you are a fan of Apple and Steve Jobs, you probably have read much of what is contained in this book already. Most of the original sources that Walter Isaacson references in the back of the book are more accurate than his summaries of their content in this book. There are also some technical details that are wrong, but if you're not a software developer or hardware engineer, these probably won't bother you.  This is a decent read for those who want an overview of Steve Jobs and his companies, but not a book for those who are looking for details that someone who was given exclusive access to Steve Jobs could provide. Personally, I was hoping for much more from Isaacson.
B000001G1E|5.0|There isn't much I can add to the 54 (and counting) reviews so far, except to say that, the 4 awarding less than 5 stars must have some out-of-this-world standards! Not only do you get 72 songs in great AAD sound reproduction (the description says \\"All tracks on Star Time were prepared from the original session tapes or the original single and album masters, under the supervision of Harry Weinger), but many are both Parts 1 & 2 of some of his 119 nationally-charting singles registered between 1958 and 1998 for 10 different labels, while a few others were flipsides of some of his earliest charting sides (which themselves are also included).<br /><br />Obviously, all 119 are not here, nor do all 72 represent only charted sides, but in that regard it's important to note this does NOT advertise itself as a \\"greatest hits of\\" or \\"best of\\" compilation. As it says on the reverse of the box, this is \\"The Definitive 35th Anniversary James Brown Collection - 5 Hours Of Music, 72 Songs, Including Many Rare Or Previously Unreleased.\\" One oddity included is the 1960 hit (Do The) Mashed Potatoes Pt.1 which was credited to Nat Kendrick & The Swans. This was, in fact, Brown's backup band consisting of Fats Gonder, Bobby Roach, Bernard Odum, J.C. Adams and drummer Kendrick. On the cut James plays piano while the vocal shouts come courtesy of DJ King Coleman.<br /><br />Then there's the magnificent 5\\" x 11\\" 64-page booklet containing essays by Cliff White & Harry Weinger, Nelson George, and Alan M.

Throughout are numerous vintage photographs, album/poster reproductions, a song-by-song sessionography, and a complete James Brown singles discography.<br /><br />If you were a fan of \\"The Hardest Working Man In Show Business\\" you will love this masterful box-set compilation of the work of James Brown, inducted into the R&R Hall Of Fame in 1986 in its first year of operation and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992, and who sadly passed away at age 73 on Christmas Day 2006.d in 1992, and who sadly passed away at age 73 on Christmas Day 2006.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|I listened to this record three times all the way through before posting any reviews. What sticks out in my mind the most is the high use of the N word. Being a white girl, it's a little difficult for me to sing these songs at the top of my lungs and feel comfortable with the language. That being said, there are a lot of mellow tracks on here which are good for relaxing to. Definitely enjoying it, but not as much as previous records where I loved every song and was not embarrassed to play them.
B005DMNS4A|1.0|The Who do not exist.  They died with Keith Moon.  Everything else Townsend has released under their name since then has been a cheap imitation culminating with that pathetic Super Bowl performance.  When it first came out Quadrophenia was an album that the critics hated - especially Daltry's vocals, but I sort of liked.  My main criticism was that there was not enough good material for one album - let alone two.  Then after Keith died the Who released The Kids are Alright and the Quadrophenia movie.  Of course the movie came with yet another soundtrack.  All of the sudden this was classic Who.  Now Townsend is looking to cash in one more time by further padding this album with demos?  How many times do you go to the well.  I'm sure he will want to do a Quadrophenia tour now.  Rip off.  If you want to hear and see the Who in all of their glory buy the Isle of Wright video from the early 70s'.  Skip this.
B006FE3FFC|5.0|Great episode and what you've been wanting since the first season.  This seems to be a pivotal point (hopefully more to come) for the characters.
0439023521|4.0|The novel is quick and to the point. You aren't lost in details or introduced to a pantheon of characters either. With that being said you feel like you got a quick glipse at a very interesting world, but just a glipse. Hunger games is a easy read which has a few literary aspects desired, but this doesn't disqualify it from being a fun page turner.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I did a factory reset on my phone and this was the first app I installed on it. This is a great application, I cannot be without it. Great work...
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Transaction went very smooth! I love this show...my wife and I have watched the entire series twice now! The cast has great chemistry...hope this show lasts many more year.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|There have been a number of times when I've been completely lost as to what I should whip up for dinner and this little app has saved the day. I it also comes with a number of videos that effectively demonstrate different techniques, most of which I found to be very helpful.
B005R4255C|5.0|I have just received it and listen it! Smth each MJ fan should have in his home.<br />It's a nice album, nice remixes and for me, having MJ albums on the market, even if with old songs but on new music lines which does not destroy the music base of the songs, it's smth I will always appreciate.
B003L77G06|5.0|We love this show.  All of the episodes are funny!!  Good purchase.  I love having them on dvd so we can save up our recording space on our DVR. I also love being able to watch any episode we want.
1400069181|4.0|I enjoyed the stories from this book that shared how different companies are making a difference - what a different world this would be if everyone followed the TOMS One for One model. I'm not the most business savvy either but I was encouraged to learn about so many different companies who started with a group of people with an idea and not necessarily the know-how to make it happen but that learned that know-how and came out on top.
0142419400|5.0|I strongly suggest reading this amazing book. Not once did i put it down. Stephanie created such lovable, witty charactars, you wish you could be there friends. WOW.
B002OG5GT8|3.0|I bought this headphone amplifier so I could use it in conjunction with my headphones and standalone microphone to use for gaming. I am too cheap to buy a separate gaming headset for another $80-$100. I already had a pair of $130 audiophile headphones and a cheap $10 mic from Radio Shack, so I figure I'd buy a cheap amp that I can AUX out from my TV. For what I wanted, this amp was perfect for the task.  The only thing that I want to warn potential buyers about is that the quality is a bit disappointing. The housing is aluminum which is nice and pretty much copies an iPod shuffle - you can take that as being good or bad. The clip design isn't great and wobbles when you rotate it (like when you separate an Oreo). The plastic components look and feel cheap and overall doesn't FEEL solidly built.  But like I said, it works fine and I haven't had any issues with it. I probably still would have bought it (I paid $20) had I known about the disappointing quality. Just don't be fooled (like I was) into thinking this was some really sleek and cool-looking device.
B000001EKX|5.0|This album is absolutely perfect. Every song is good rock and roll that is meant to be listened to at loud volumes. I can listen to this album over and over again and not get tired of it. The songs have an amazing sound. I highly recommend this album.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I have a 2005 Mazda Miata with a stock stereo and a dealer installed DICE iPod kit/interface. I purchased the car used and do not have an iPod. When I tried to get my boyfriend's iPod to work, I found that the controls for DICE are very confusing, so I didn't even consider buying one and decided to get an auxiliary input.  A \\"professional\\" at the car audio store said it would cost $100-150 to get the stereo switched from an iPod kit to Auxiliary. (Might as well get a new stereo!) I then considered an FM modulator after some research, but I lucked out and found this cable. I  purchased it instead of the modulator for same price but a much easier installation.  The DockBoss works GREAT! All I did was plug it in to the DICE cable where the iPod would usually go, and the music works on all speakers. My Android phone works with this, as well as my boyfriend's iPod. I have had one issue, which I am not even sure is related to this cable but worth mentioning. Sometimes the audio input doesn't work, and that only happens if I leave the stereo on when I turn the car off. Turning the stereo off before I turn the whole car off prevents this from happening and it works every time.  This was a great deal for the price and I highly recommend it to anyone who has an iPod jack but wants to use something that isn't made by Apple (or the controls are difficult, like with the DICE kit in my car).
B004HO6I2E|3.0|I really liked this story...but when you add innocent babies to ANY movie it kills the story with all that nudity AND cheating.  The movie would have been funny and great otherwise.  It would have been really fun without all the nudity.  Why do we have to have SO MUCH nastiness in the movies we watch now-a-days???????????????  Some things are still unacceptable to a LOT of us so cool it!!!  There are a LOT of us that want to laugh without the discomfort of having to watch so much SEX going on!!!!!!!
B0030Y10QQ|5.0|Dvd is just as awesome as the cd! Outstanding addition & a \\"must\\" for the Savatage fan. Only draw-back is Criss Olivia is not performing on the dvd. That was a let-down.
B005R4255C|5.0|I am a huge fan of MJ's original music and art, and remixes and modified versions is something I am usually apprehensive about. After seeing Cirque Du Soleil's Immortal World Tour LIVE I was looking forward to ordering the Deluxe Version MJ Immortal. I truly enjoy it!!! Listening to the CD after seeng the show makes sense of every note and beat one can hear. I am thrilled I got it!
B005FMZWD8|4.0|The joy of having a watch on the right arm with the control buttons easily accessible!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  This watch is for a large man with large hands.  It does not look so good on a man (even if he is large)with smaller hands.  The one negative comment is that the band is too narrow.  It is a simple cloth strap.  Perhaps Invicta expects that customers will want to pick the band that best suits their lifestyles.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Once in a while, Hollywood gets it right. &#34;Captain America: The First Avenger&#34; (2011) is nostalgic fun. Director Joe Johnston doesn't let CGI overwhelm this engaging World War II comic-book adventure. Chris Evans delivers a sincere performance in the title role — well-matched by Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Stanley Tucci (doing his best Maximilian Schell imitation) and a memorably villainous Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull. The Marvel superhero finally receives the A-list production he richly deserves.
1463514581|5.0|It's true. I could NOT put this book down. I was hooked from the moment that I opened the book. Rose is hysterical, witty and a woman that I wouldn't mind being.<br /><br />It starts with Rose working at her every day job working @ the DMV when a man approaches her counter. She has a vision of herself dead on her sofa (well, her mama's sofa due to her living with her mama) and this man that walked up to her counter holds the key to her vision.<br /><br />Her mama is not an easy woman to live with and has pretty much ran Rose's life forever. When her mama winds up the one dead (don't worry, I didn't spoil anything! this is found on the back cover) Rose has to figure out how to live her life how she wants without her mama ruling her life.<br /><br />This book is filled with suspense, love, a hilarious accent that you'll find yourself reading in, and a page turner that will stay by your side until you've finished it. Denise Grover Swank will not disappoint you in her first Rose Gardner mystery. I am anxiously awaiting the second novel!
1423140591|4.0|Percy is back. If it was possible to convey all your happiness in a sentence, that sentence would be it. I was so happy to see Percy again.<br /><br />The Goddess Hera(Greek form)/Juno (Roman form) has been messing with the demi gods. She placed Percy in a deep sleep for months and then when he awoke, she erased his memories. All Percy remembers is that he has a girlfriend named Annabeth and he might be a demi-god. Percy finds himself at Camp Jupiter, a camp for demi gods, but everything seems a little off. He knows that this isn't his camp and he has a habit of referring to everything by their Greek counterparts.<br /><br />Camp Jupiter is under fire. People who are dying aren't staying dead and a massive force is on their way to attack the camp. When the war god Mars visits the camp, Percy is sent off on his quest in Alaska with his new friends Frank and Hazel (two demi-gods with secrets) to free Death from the clutches of the goddess Gaia (spelling?) and her son. If they don't succeed their camp is doomed.<br /><br />Okay, so you know my plot reviews suck. I have no idea why you keep reading them.<br /><br />Let's get to the point.<br /><br />I loved this book. Despite having lost his memory, Percy was his usual sarcastic self. Hazel and Frank were just too cute for words. The plot was intriguing and the pacing (differing points of view from all three protagonists) were interesting and didn't slow down the pace of the story.<br /><br />While I really enjoyed The Lost Hero, THE SON OF NEPTUNE was better. I think it's better because with The Lost Hero we were introduced to three new charecters who we were supposed to identify with, characters who while interesting didn't hold a candle to Percy. Can anyone? With THE SON OF NEPTUNE we not only have the awesome Percy Jackson but his new cohorts Frank and Hazel have ties to some familiar characters in the previous Percy Jackson series in some unique and exciting ways. Frank and Hazel's backstory's were just as intriguing as Percy's and you were rooting for them from the beginning. THE SON OF NEPTUNE is a excellent filler story as we build up to the seven getting together to fulfill the prophecy. Since the next book is called The Mark of Athena, I'm assuming it's going to focused on Annabeth? I can't wait. It sucks that these books come out one a year.<br /><br />Really, I know this review blows, but if you haven't read this series, or the one before it (Percy Jackson) you are totally missing out. Read these books!ng. THE SON OF NEPTUNE is a excellent filler story as we build up to the seven getting together to fulfill the prophecy.

B0063IH60K|4.0|good game. works well on my new kindle fire. wish there were more game options besides winning draw or random draw..maybe a few more games to chose from.
0525423281|3.0|I really, really, really wanted to read LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR. I wanted to read this book from the moment I closed her debut Anna and the French Kiss. I must say that I'm glad that I waited until my library ordered a copy of LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR because if I had actually paid money for this book, I would've been very angry. It wasn't the writing, which was great. It was the plot and the characters that drove me crazy.<br /><br />Maybe I expected too much? I'm going to try to articulate why LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR was a letdown for me. The main reason was that Lola didn't connect with me as a character. Probably because she spent the whole book lying to everyone around her and deception/lying is one of my biggest romance pet peeves. I know that as a teenager that your emotions are haywire and you often lie to yourself and others without meaning to, but that still doesn't make you the best possible choice for the heroine in a romance novel. I needed deeper motivation to justify why Lola spent so much time lying to everyone.<br /><br />It wasn't only Lola that I had trouble with but I had trouble with the majority of the main characters. The book seemed forced, as if she was trying to live up to the success of Anna and having trouble doing so.<br /><br />I mean really, what was wrong with Max. He started out like this great character. The only issue that seemed wrong with him was his age (he's 22, she's 17). While that is something to raise an eyebrow about, in the beginning (before the novel went down into lala land for the sake of trying to get Lola and Cricket together) I didn't get why everyone around her freaked so much about it, even she and him. Granted, I might have felt this way because when I was 16/17 I dated a guy while not 22, was 19/20 and out of school. I was annoyed that Max suddenly morphed into this bad guy. I mean really why wouldn't he, Lola had been lying to him forever. When she finally went and broke up with her and he got nasty with her, I was actually cheering for him and he was supposed to be the 'villain' in all this. LOL.<br /><br />This love triangle Lola/Max/Cricket bothered the heck out of me. It was not well executed like the triangle in Anna. I think because she was working too hard to make Max appear to be a bad guy and Lola spent so much time playing games that I lost a lot of respect for her. While I see how Lola and Cricket were actually good for each other, I thought Max if she hadn't went down the very obvious are you kidding me trying to obviously make him the villain road, would have worked just as well. In the end, I agreed with Max's parting shout about Lola. In the end, with all the costumes, Lola was just a little girl with a lot of issues.for him and he was supposed to be the 'villain' in all this. LOL.

B0063GORYU|4.0|I would recommend this game to anyone. Works great on my Galaxy Tab 10.1. Easy to adjust options. Ads are annoying but go away with one click.  It's FREE.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I heartily concur with the high praise for the cast and crew of this excellent HBO series that is now well into its fantastic second season.  But no one has mentioned the music as there are episodes portraying popular twenties singers Sophie Tucker and Eddie Cantor, with the part of Cantor played and sung well by Stephen DeRosa.  He hasn't shown up much if at all this second season, but the soundtrack still plays a crucial role all its own.  The Season 1 soundtrack for the show is well worth seeking out on CD or MP3.  Great and timeless stuff!
B004JMRDQE|5.0|This an incredible movie. EPIC.  Spellbinding, stunning, so poignant and moving. A must see for all. There are so many different facets to this film that I wouldn't think anyone could watch it just once. Hard to believe this is the same \\"honey bunny\\" guy from pulp fiction.

B002IDDRT8|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase; being that I really love science fiction but hate cheesy sci-fi films. This movie was extremely well done and I have to say frighteningly realistic at some points. Jim Caviezel, as always, did a fine job as did Sophia Myles. Liked the underlying storylines which question the moral right of expansion and think the overall main plot was excellent.

055380684X|1.0|Scientifically Inaccurate   You can NOT grow myelin.  If you could we wouldn't have diseases such as MS.  The value is practice but half this book is about how you can grow myelin through practice.  That's incorrect and extremely misleading because myelin is the talent code.  Well actually myelin and proper practice is the talent code. There are plenty of resources to support my point

NOW MY COLLECTION IS COMPLETE, AND THAT MAKES ME APPRECIATE THIS EVEN MORE. THE SONG/VIDEO HE DID WITH HIS NEPHEWS (3T) WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. AFTER WATCHING THE COLLECTION MYSELF, I WATCHED IT AGAIN WITH MY FAMILY, WHO SAID THEY WILL DEFINATELY PURCHASE IT!
B000NA28I4|1.0|The books are GREAT! It was so sad when they butchered the movie. I kept watching and thinking \\"That is not how it happened in the book!\\" or \\" I thought she was an Elf ?\\" I had to explain to my husband how bad they messed it up.<br /><br />I can only hope one day someone will remake it into the great film it could be. They didn't do Lord of the Rings right the first time either and now we have an EPIC!
B006BQM762|1.0|The movie has no real plot, and the characters are not believable at all.  The 'alien' is kept in shadows at all times like used to happen in the really old sci-fi movies where it was done due to how hard it was to make the alien believable.  Attempts to communicate with the alien are just absurd, and lead to an anti-climatic ending.  This is like a modern version of those really, really bad sci-fi B-movies of the 50's and 60's.

1594744769|4.0|As other's have said, this is definitely not a book that should be read on a Kindle or any other e-Reader.  I found myself referring back to my computer to read some of the photographed letters so I could read them clearly.<br /><br />The book, was AWESOME!  Loved it.  Although I was left a little confused about the whole \\"looped world\\" thing and how that all worked, it definitely kept me reading...I'm a slower reader, but it was a great, adventurous book!  That would be cool if it went beyond the end though...what happens after they see the ships?  So what?
0446585025|5.0|I love Ellen and I love this book.  I did not read her first two books but I bought this one as soon as it came out.  I really loved it and was laughing out loud while reading this.  At times I had to call my sister to tell her about what I just read that was so funny!
B004UFEJS0|5.0|This movie is adorable and a Must have for Disney movie collections. The characters are very likeable and the story is great. So glad they came out with a combo pack. Now I get the Blu-ray for me and the DVD for my daughter. Win Win!!

Either use a power strip or turn the volume completely down will work easily. For the money, it can't be beat. I worked as a professional DJ and Sound Tech for 8 years.

0393072231|5.0|In \\"The Big Short\\" Michael Lewis fleshes out a handful of relentlessly skeptical and contrarian characters within the financial industry at a time when most of America was sleepwalking toward the subprime meltdown of 2008. Lewis has a knack for telling huge stories that comprise entire epochs through character driven narratives that sparkle with ironic insight and sardonic humor. And in this effort he does it through a few obscure market players who saw through the Wall Street scam that has us reeling to this very day. None of them seemed to believe a single word they were hearing from banking analysts, bond sales reps, trading desks, the Fed, Treasury, etc.  It's as if \\"Caveat emptor\\" (Latin for `Let the buyer beware') was tattooed on the inside of their skulls.  At times I felt as if I was reading Tom Wolfe's \\"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\" and \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" simultaneously, except that there was no acid -- just lots of Kool-Aid and oceans of vanity.  Lewis's main characters approached the market like underpaid gumshoe detectives trying to crack a big case and I found myself pulling for these guys, hoping that they would prevail in this dark and tragic saga. Not only did it take nerves of steel to actually short the subprime bubble with the tenacity and courage that they displayed, it took an admirable amount of heart, or maybe soul is the word I'm searching for. But they were smart enough to do their homework, as well as being hardened cynics with no faith in a system that was putting lipstick on a wild boar and letting it loose in the subprime derivatives casino.    Many people wish they had been equally suspicious of Wall Street and its black box shenanigans in the mortgage bond market now that they have the advantage of hindsight. But foresight is what we need, and as the fallout from 2008 continues to spread across the globe like a strain of deadly influenza we need foresight more now than ever. Or maybe we just need to call a spade a spade.  Michael Lewis sometimes uses words like \\"deadbeat\\" to describe people who can't pay off their loans. Or he uses words like \\"scumbag\\" to describe people who finance, underwrite, and repackage loans that people can't pay off, which are then sold to other unsuspecting investors. If all of us would remember to duck whenever we see \\"scumbags\\" lending money to \\"deadbeats\\" we would be better off in the future.  But Lewis makes it clear that this is particularly difficult when the Masters of the Universe on Wall Street are wont to lie through their teeth. Some lied happily, some were paid to lie and some were threatened if they didn't lie, like the rating agencies (Moody's, S & P, etc.). And then, there were those who simply didn't know what was going on in the first place. Unfortunately, some of them were the CEOs of the big investment banks.   None of the above should be regarded as past tense. \\"The Big Short\\" makes you realize that each decade gives birth to an even more heinous mutant as its progenitor rises from the ashes of the previous debacle like the mythical phoenix. You get this creepy feeling that we will see more dramas unfold that involve loaning money to those who don't have it, and cannot, or will not, pay it back, and even if they could, would get gypped out of it in a New York minute by some slick talking card sharp in a pin-striped suit.  The moral to the story in \\"The Big Short\\" is to keep your powder dry and wait until there is blood in the streets. Then check your facts before you buy.

098357670X|5.0|I have followed Tom's blog since the beginning and have always been grateful for the FREE tutorials and information that he posted on a daily basis. Tom is a natural as a teacher and his explanations are thorough and easy to understand. In his new book you will be amazed at how much you learn on each page. Tom isn't offering you a magic wand that will magically make you a Richmond clone. Think of it more as a hefty new set of tools. Practice with them and you can become a master carpenter if you lazily apply them you'll be making Popsicle stick bird houses in the garage. This book is worth twice what he is asking if you compare it to other books in the genre...wait what am I saying? There is no comparing! Enough review reading, go get the book, you're wasting time! ;)
B002U0KHMY|5.0|This is a great series. Very smart and entertaining. I don't think I've ever been so addicted to any series.
0439882826|5.0|Bought for my 4 year old and I to read, I spent some time ensuring that I could keep the content age appropriate.  I found no problem throughout; excerpting some Vader.  Albeit I'm explaining how Anakin becomes Vader a lot.  All the pages are great.  Good write ups and large pop-ups, with smaller side pop-ups.  There are also 2 glowing lightsabers for a nice finale'.  We spend a lot of time reading a couple of pages every night.  Well worth the fair price.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|Who in their right mind would give this thing five stars? It's a mish mash of tacky one liners and sterotypes from conflicting genres which came off more like a spoof of every cowboy and alien movie ever released. Its just as silly as the title implies...cowboys fighting cowboys, then indians then aliens...The best minds in Hollywood lost their minds for this one..I gave it one star because you can't beat Daniel Craig in chaps!!!!!
1451648537|5.0|This book touched me and taught me much about Steve Jobs, business, creativity, human nature, family, relationships and much more. The book is all *but* hagiographic. It presents an almost surgical picture of Jobs' complex personnality -- I use 'surgical' for lack of a better word to characterize the detailed, analytical portrayal of Steve Jobs with his extremely wide spectrum of qualities, ranging from the greatest greatness to quite appalling flaws.   One of the main themes of the book is Steve Jobs' \\"reality distortion field\\", which manifested itself positively in Jobs' ability to drive his vision, however challenging, into reality, and negatively in his denial of the facts, ideas and people that would get in the way of his creative process. A representative quote attributed to Pixar's marketing director, Pam Kerwin: \\"He [Steve Jobs] was so weirdly charismatic that you almost had to get deprogrammed after you talked to him\\".  Steve Jobs said he allowed this book to be written so that his kids knew and understood him better. By fostering the book in spite of his reluctance to breach his privacy, Jobs also gave a great gift to us, the book's readers. One of the many gifts he gave to the world. May he rest in peace.
1451648537|5.0|I am quite impressed by the book. Besides being the official biography, the book offers an accurate representation of Steve's life, without a biased tone of voice. The story is told as it was, honestly and truthfully. For those who felt, and still do, the loss of Steve, this book offers a welcoming nostalgia for the greatest man on earth. It is the perfect book to pick up and read when one is depressed and missing Steve.
1451648537|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. Steve Jobs was such an influence in his life style and his field. He will be truely missed. A must read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm application does everything you'd need a modern-day alarm clock to do. It has made my life soo much easier. If you need an app that will allow you to set multiple alarms, and have them running at the same time, this is it. It will allow you to customize sound for each as well. If you doc your device and use it as a night stand clock, it is a bit bright, but using this in conjunction with an app called 'Night Clock' solves that issue. I love this app.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Having seen Adele perform in a very intimate setting, I can say that this DVD and CD truly captures the beautiful and timeless quality of her live performance. She is a true artist in every sense of the word and this is the perfect addition to any fan's collection - she performs a great variety of songs from \\"19\\" and \\"21\\". Her cover of \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\" is absolutely brilliant as well. This is just the beginning of a legendary career and I can't wait to look back, watch this, and continue to see where she grows.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Oh! How I loved Firefly! From that first show I was hooked like a starving fish.  Each and every show was filled from top to bottom with wonderful things, old and new.  Such a refreshing look at the future!  Unbelievable chemistry between the actors made this so exceptional.  The writing was spot-on in every show.  The music sent me into a yearning mode for more space cowboy adventuring.  That theme song just grips me in the heart.  I have fallen in love with Mal, and watch him in Castle, but he needs to be back at the helm of Serenity.  So glad they made the movie, Serenity, to wrap things up.
0143038583|5.0|America doesn't enjoy a healthy, traditional, time-proven national cuisine.  We are bombarded by a phenomenal variety of food options, and this makes us dizzy and highly susceptible to food fads.  Our venerable nutrition experts point us in every imaginable direction, and some dietary factions have evolved into militant food jihads.  Michael Pollan was fascinated by this chaotic realm of greed, deceit, ignorance, confusion, fantasy, and flame-throwing righteousness.  He wrote The Omnivore's Dilemma in a heroic effort to provide us with something resembling an objective, unbiased investigative journalist's overview of the American food system.<br /><br />The first of Pollan's three lessons discusses the world of industrial corn.  Cheap, subsidized, processed corn has become our number one source of nutrients.  Americans have become \\"corn chips with legs.\\"  Forty years ago, my Uncle Blaine's dairy cows enjoyed a diet of delicious North Dakota grass.  I was saddened to realize that today's milk, butter, and cheese are primarily made of corn, not grass.  A corn-fed cow consumes the equivalent of 35 gallons of fossil fuel.  Beef, pork, chicken, and eggs are also largely corn-based.  Pollan describes the mass production of corn-fed meat at Confined Animal Feeding Operations -- profitable enterprises that are disgustingly cruel and filthy.<br /><br />Pollan's discussion of nitrogen fertilizer blew my mind -- it's a primary contributor to humankind's population explosion.  Without synthetic fertilizer, it would not be possible for the human herd to exceed four billion.  Prior to 1945, we ate crops produced by solar-powered plants.  Now, a tsunami of synthetic fertilizers is using corn plants to convert fossil fuels into food.  To produce one calorie of industrial corn requires using more than one calorie of fossil fuel.<br /><br />The second lesson examines the farm world beyond industrial corn.  We are introduced to the remarkably clever Joel Salatin, who excels at producing impressive quantities of grass-fed meat without cruelty, crowding, pollution, or land degradation.  His meat is superior to industrial organic meats.  Thanks to big money, organic standards have been seriously weakened.  It's OK to raise organic beef on filthy feedlots.  Organic chickens can be raised in metal sheds where 20,000 birds are jam-packed together -- and the \\"free range\\" label is essentially meaningless marketing gibberish.<br /><br />Organic agriculture used to be the realm of groovy small-scale hippy enterprises, but they have been pushed aside by the rise of industrial-scale organic farming, which uses no less fossil energy than conventional farming.  Industrial organic produces large quantities of food at a lower cost than hippy farmers, and it is designed to smoothly integrate with the corporate food retailing industry.  Whole Foods isn't interested in buying ten boxes of carrots from Henry the Hippy.<br /><br />The third lesson discusses the hunter-gatherer way of eating.  Pollan foraged for greens, mushrooms, and fruit.  He learned how to use a gun, and he shot a wild pig.  He created a meal for which he had provided most of the ingredients himself.  He was fully conscious of where the food came from, and how it was prepared -- a very different experience from the standard American mealtime.<br /><br />This section included a thoughtful discussion of the ethics of meat-eating.  Pollan carefully explored the realm of animal rights philosophy.  I was surprised (and delighted) to learn that many animal rights thinkers have contempt for domesticated species, because they exist only to be used by their human owners.  I was also surprised (and stunned) to learn that some animal rights folks see wild predators, like lions and tigers, as being wrong or evil because they are hurtful to others.<br /><br />The one notable shortcoming of the book is that it did not include a robust discussion of sustainability.  Sustainable agriculture is a rarity.  Never forget that it was low-impact, muscle-powered, 100% organic farming that destroyed the agricultural systems of countless extinct civilizations.  Any petroleum-based process is unsustainable.  But even if organic farming was done with just muscle power, most of it would still be unsustainable.  Much modern farming depends on irrigation, and irrigated agriculture commonly self-destructs.  Pollan mentions that Iowa has lost half of its topsoil in 150 years, but he fails to warn us that raising annual crops in tilled fields is almost always unsustainable, because it destroys the soil.  There are many ways to produce wholesome food without irrigation, tilling, petroleum, or animal enslavement -- and they should be at the center of our attention today.<br /><br />Pollan is a skilled writer and a sharp thinker, and he has written a stimulating, informative, and easy-to-read book.  I would strongly recommend it to animals who eat food.<br /><br />Richard Adrian Reese<br />Author of What Is Sustainable100% organic farming that destroyed the agricultural systems of countless extinct civilizations.

0142403873|5.0|We got this book for my toddler about a year ago, just after he turned two. He started by not having enough patience to finish the story, but enjoying the pictures and a quick summary of the book. Now, at age three, he absolutely LOVES it, and loves hearing it for bedtime or when he wakes up.<br /><br />The book has beautiful illustrations - the cover snapshot shows the quality of the artwork - and a verse on each page, lovely rhyming prose you can sing-song to your child.<br /><br />* SPOILERS *<br /><br />The story follows the travels of a small mouse as he wanders through a wood, meeting a series of animals who \\"invite him home\\" for dinner. To each of the predators, he says he's waiting to meet a 'gruffalo', a made-up monster who he describes by a few features(such as his \\"knobby knees\\" or perhaps the \\"purple prickles on his back\\"), and claims that the animal the mouse is talking to is the gruffalo's favorite food. This is enough to scare each of the predators away.<br /><br />Halfway through the book, the mouse encounters the gruffalo! Once again he uses his wits to save himself, this time by convincing the Gruffalo there are easier meals to be had than the mouse, in quite a clever way :)<br /><br />* END SPOILERS *<br /><br />Pro:<br />+ beautiful illustrations, lots of detail, and good expressions on the animals to discuss with your child<br />+ well-written narrative, written as rhyming lyrics which are fun to read<br />+ a good story showing the value of wits over brawn<br />+ the perfect length for bedtime!

B004BRP7R4|2.0|I freely acknowledge the beauty and power of Josh's voice and I am a great fan. From moment I heard him, that is the voice I would give almost anything to possess. I have all of his albums ....    That being said; While I cannot presume to know his intent, I believe Josh is experimenting, and understandably so.  He must feel adrift and somewhat polarized between accepted genres. Opera, Popular, or some successful amalgamation of both. Whatever the intent, this is not the album. Where it is not over-orchestrated, it feels strained, and the overall impression for me, was that it simply feels unfinished. More like a rehearsal that was never intended for release.

It was a book I could leave alone for a few days rather than \\"couldn't put it down\\" mentality.  I have read several Picoult books. Guess I like more drama.

B005F96UNM|4.0|[Review based on the theatrical release.] This is an fascinatingly stylized film that is as much about filmmaking itself as it is about its mythological, Joseph Campbell-esque plot. I was originally interested in it because of the involvement of Japanese singer/auteur Gackt, whose staged works I greatly admire. However, when I read the mainstream reviews, I went into the theater thinking than the film would be a disaster or even worse, a \\"so bad it's bad\\" bore.  Nothing could be further from the truth. I found the film engaging from beginning to end, with more visual information packed into the theatrically lit and staged frames than could possibly be absorbed in a single viewing. During the showing I didn't look at my watch once and I am not easily amused.  This film deserves to advance to \\"cult classic\\" status and is a film that deserves to be added to future film school curricula because of its success in using many of the devices of filmmaking and theater to create a visually consistent, entirely artificial world. I usually rent instead of buying, but this film is worth more than one watch, just to absorb more of the kaleidoscopic visuals.  If you love the \\"production design\\" aspect of filmmaking, this is a five-star movie. If you mostly care about story and a novel plotline, then call it 2 ½ stars because there is little new in the plot. If you like a mythological story that is told in a way you have never seen before, then Bunraku is a solid four stars.
B003YGSLDA|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite Christmas movies as a child! I was 5 years old when this movie was released and I remember watching it at a very young age! It left an impact on my life! I was so amazed with Santa's workshop and the elves! This movie seems to bring it to life in a way you have never seen before! The music alone could get you in the Christmas spirit! The Blu-Ray special features are excellent with 28 minutes of behind the scenes footage of the press conference scene and it also includes deleted scenes! This is a must see in 1080p High Definition! This is a great movie for children of all ages - although, please note, there is a scene when John Lithgow delivers a few curse words! This movie will become a family viewing tradition in my home every Christmas!!

098357670X|5.0|I ordered this book as I am a fan of Tom Richmond and his artwork for a couple of years. The best thing about this book is the concept. It has a lot of caricature examples to each subject. It is written in a way that you can read it from the beginning to the end or use it like a dictionary and only read about the subject you`re interested in. You don`t have to be a professionell caricaturist do understand it. If you`re interested in the \\"MAD Art\\" of caricature..than this is one of the must-have-books you should own..
1451648537|5.0|If you have any interest in the background of the development of one of the greatest technology companies of our time and the man who saved it from extinction this book is for you.  I read it over three or four days and found it hard to put down.  Job's quirky personality, his combative and abusive management style, and his uncanny ability to focus on what people will want before they know they want it makes for a continually interesting story.  I think Walter Isaacson did a fantastic job putting together to story of Steve Jobs life and, by extension, the story of Apple Computer (now known as just \\"Apple\\").

I needed to know if it didn't have English subtitles because had I known this I would've ordered another one because I need the English subtitles, all it had was French, nothing else.<br /><br />It is the two-disc version as advertised but other than that it's completely useless to me which is why Mr. Brown has it back for return delivery.<br /><br />I've reordered another one and according to this website it does have English subtitles along with French and Spanish, I'll have to wait and see until tomorrow when it arrives, this is great because my fiancee has hearing problems and English subtitles fixes that problem.<br /><br />Hopefully the UPS guy gives me more than two seconds to get to the door; he/she acted like a hunted animal by ringing the doorbell, dropping the package at the door, and getting away like he just robbed a bank!<br /><br />The two-star rating is for the lack of English subtitles and not the movie/dvd/packing, .etc.  The movie is 5-star without a problem.
1451627289|1.0|It's been a long time since I've read Stephen King, about 20 years. I read a number of his novels as a teenager and was quite the fan. I was looking forward to reading 11 22 63, looking forward to coming back to someone whose work I enjoyed so much a long time ago.  And I was utterly disappointed. I'm almost sorry to say it, because I wanted to like this novel. I kept asking myself just how adolescent, how dorky, a tone this narrator really struck. What kind of 64 year-old man writes a character who says things about teenagers like, \\"His face was an exploding zit-factory below a Brylcreem-loaded Bobby Rydell duck's ass. He looked like he might get his first kiss from a real live girl around the age of forty-two\\"? (365-6)   I came to these two sentences after wincing at hundreds more and after increasingly rolling my eyes when the protagonist does nearly every noble thing possible, from saving lives to casting football players in high school plays that cause the whole audience, other footballers included, to erupt into paroxysms of weeping.   That's why the two sentences I quoted above hit me the way they did. The kind of person who says such things, or has a protagonist who's a dead ringer for himself say such things, is the kind of person who feels that kind of insecurity about himself. 11 22 63 feels like a book by an elderly adolescent who still has to prove to the world that he can save the girl or foil the dumb football jock.  I see I'm one of a very few here who dislike this novel, but I was hoping for so much more. It's too bad this novel didn't come out when I was still reading Stephen King at age 16, and it's too bad that with all his writing experience, Stephen King doesn't have more to offer us.

1594201927|4.0|Ferguson's book will appeal to that unique person who is interested both in finance and in history. If your background isn't in finance, you'll need to look up a few unfamiliar terms. But the results will be well worth your effort.<br /><br />My main critique of the book is that Ferguson's discussion of the 2008 financial crisis comes out of nowhere and really doesn't fit his stated purpose of giving a financial history of the world. I don't disagree with his analysis, but I think the book's narrative would have been better off had that chapter simply been left out.<br /><br />Still, Ferguson's sins of narrative weren't so severe that I wouldn't read any of his other books. He discusses issues intelligently and without any obvious political bias. I imagine that both left and right would find something to like here.
1451627289|5.0|I have long been a fan of Stephen King's novels. He is a master of pulling you into his stories and making you forget everything around. I love the ways his writing can take something very far-fetched and make it seem possible. Or wish were possible. This book has everything I love in a great novel; it's long (not the least bit tedious, keeps your attention from the beginning), has great dialogue, is imaginative, and has a very well organized plot. And the subject speaks to me, as I'm sure it does to many Americans. I wasn't born until 1965, but the descriptions of that era resonate with me. I remember my parents dancing and the music they danced to. I grew up with cigarette smoke all around me. Cell phones, the internet and society's real dependence on computers didn't happen until I was out of high school. King's descriptions of the landscapes, people, and language are so realistic of the times. I think many of us remember the 'simpler' times before our American way of life became so fast paced and wish to go back. Mr. King takes us there. But he pulls in his personal brand of 'darkness' (for want of a better word) and shows us the shadows on those silver clouds.  This is one of the best books I've ever read and one of my favorite King novels.

0446571415|1.0|I have to start by saying I LOVED the first 3 in this series. I love the characters, and the great storytelling. I have no idea what could have happened in this story - it's almost like Baldacci has decided to kill off the series by writing a rotten book, or asked an amateur to write this one for him. His heart just didn't seem to be in it.<br /><br />The characters were not even close to plausible or believable, making it impossible to identify with anyone. Loose ends coming together in ways so implausible it made me want to stop several times. The \\"cliche\\" factor was incredibly high in this one, to the point where it was impossible to really identify with any of the characters.<br /><br />Again, I'm a huge fan of the Camel Club series, and if I had it to do over, I'd skip this one completely, and hope for a better one next time. We all have bad days, and maybe even blockbuster authors like Baldacci put out a bad book now and again. That's the scenario I'm hoping for!

The game has pretty deep mechanics and even has a game plus mode after you finish the final battle. There are a few locations and equipment (along with extra bosses) only available in the game plus mode. This is definitely well worth the price and better than a  lot of NDS/PSP games out there.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|The latest bestseller from the late sci-fi/tech writer Michael Crichton - this time co-authored by Richard Preston, author of one of my favorite non-fiction thrillers The Hot Zone - has given me something to be happy about.  I'm happy I borrowed this book from a friend rather than spending money on it.  I was disappointed in Crichton's last posthumous effort, Pirate Latitudes. But with Micro to call my reaction \\"disappointment\\" would be a gross understatement. The plot involves a team of scientists who get shruck down to half-inch size by the bad guy and then manage to escape into the Hawaiian rain forest. Mayhem ensures, including encounters with various insects and birds. The encounters with tropical bugs (especially a centipede) make for the most interesting parts of the book (hence the two stars instead of one). Unfortunately, once the science lesson is over it's back to our pocket cast of characters.  I suppose if I was boarding a flight and looking for something to distract me for a few hours Micro would be a decent enough travelling companion; perhaps a bit like sitting next to an aluminum siding salesperson for two or three hours who spent the time explaining the benefits and drawbacks of various types of siding materials. By the time the flight was over you might remember a few nuggets of info, but most of it had passed from one ear to the other without a single stop in between.  It's sad that the memory of Michael Chrichton is smudged by this book. He was a much better writer than this book would suggest.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I had bought this game not knowing what to expect. There is not  a lot of choice when it comes to RPG games on Android devices. However, this game surprised me. It is an amazing game, I got it on sale via Amazon app store and went on to purchase the other 2 games from the same publisher (eve of Genesis and Alphadia). They are all great games, surprisingly different from each other in art style, mechanics and UI. Definitely well worth the price and better than a lot of NDS/PSP games out there.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|This film is in a single word, awesome. Eastwood appears as the enigmatic \\"Preacher\\", a man with a dark past and a score to settle. Scene after action packed scene sees him stepping in on the side of the weak, bringing a Biblical level of vengeance with him when he does. From the classic hickory ax handle scene to the final show down, Preacher deals out justice in a manner on par with the Outlaw Jose Wales, Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name. An absolute must see for anyone who even thinks they might enjoy an action flick.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This concert is amazing! I watched her concert at Roseland (NY) and this is equally as amazing! Live or on disk! I was just planning to check if the disk works and I ended up watching the entire concert. All I know, is when Adelle starts to sing, it's all HEART and PASSION! Great songs and awesome voice!!
0525423656|5.0|Ally Condie has done it again! \\" Crossed \\" did not disappoint at all!  \\"Crossed \\" was not simply that middle novel that pushes the story farther but falls flat in the end. I felt that in \\"Matched \\" I got to know all the characters but in \\" Crossed \\" I got to love them all.<br /><br /> Cassia has been sent to a work camp, her family relocated, Xander remains in Oria, and Ky has been sent to the Outer Provinces. With Indie, a girl also assigned to the work camp, Cassia sets out determined to find Ky and join the Rebellion. Meanwhile, Ky is stuck in the Outer Provinces where the Society is sending Aberrations to act as decoys to distract the Enemy. For Ky, every day in the Outer Province is a struggle to stay alive but his love for Cassia drives him forward, focused on just seeing her again.<br /><br /> In this novel we not only get Cassia's narrative but also Ky's, and its so beautiful and wonderful because Ky is this intangible thing that we haven't really gotten to know yet. He holds so much inside and becomes so concrete in this  novel, as Condie pulls back the curtain and lets us see behind his stage. Ky's story is such a great addition to Cassia's and I'm so glad that we were allowed to see inside his head and heart.<br /><br /> In addition to Cassia and Ky, Condie also introduces a few new characters, Indie, Vick, Eli, and Hunter. Some of the characters eluded me a bit but others drew me in and even brought tears to my eyes through their stories. Its obvious that Condie had clear and concise reasons for every additional character.<br /><br /> In \\" Crossed\\" I feel that Condie really went further then simply another young adult book in the dystopian genre. She really pushed the theological envelope as her characters are challenged with the idea of \\"God,\\" some for the first times in their lives. Through the idea of \\" The Pilot \\" we see the characters challenged with the idea of believing in something larger than themselves, something they can't see and may never see.<br /><br /> I can't wait for the final book in the series, which Condie hans't set a title for yet but has promised will have a red cover. I am only sad that I have to wait another entire year for the finale of this amazing story!ok in the series, which Condie hans't set a title for yet but has promised will have a red cover.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|This film is a beautiful, whimsical tale for all ages.  The lack of dialogue and expressive music track add dimension to the already-incredible artistry of the drawings.  Each Christmas I take out a stuffed Snowman toy that has a pull string and plays the music from this film.  My three year old is in love!  The only downside is that the ending is a bit sad for my little one... but it opens up an avenue for dialogue, which is great.  If you haven't seen it, treat yourself, it is a keeper.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I will skip the usual review of the music itself, knowing that anyone who has purchased this album at one point in time owned it on vinyl during the day, and that I, as a high schooler when it was released, realize it is one of the important classic albums of all time.  This version... the accolades must be given to Steven Wilson, the mixing engineer of this version.  Forgot the original CD or the 25th Anniversary release, which was horrible, at best..even the vinyl never had a great quality sound, but the music was so exceptional, one could live with it.  There is a \\"warmth\\" to the CD, that is missing in all previous incarnations, including the original vinyl.  Steven, along with Ian Anderson's guidance, has worked lovingly on restoring what was a poor quality recording session and master tapes into an entire new recording.  No, the mixes and the songs are the same as the original (for the most part); but what you have is clarity, instruments which even on the best equipment at the time of vinyl, you would never hear, channel separation which enhances the overall experience and the realization through all of this just how magnificent of a record Jethro Tull recorded.  For those who care, the CD has the original Chrysalis label and not the domestic released Reprise label and an excellent booklet which gives insight into the making of a \\"classic\\" album.    Again, the praise must go to Steven Wilson for his meticulous work on restoring the original master tapes.  If you never buy any other remastered, anniversary or special edition CD, BUY THIS...it will not disappoint.  P.S. Best played LOUD and with headphones!

B00122Z7NK|5.0|Cross is Justice's first album. They have since become very influential in the electronic music scene, taking influence from Daft Punk. Although Daft Punk may have influenced them, I personally feel that this album transcends the emotional impact that Daft Punk's albums have had on me. Justice takes gritty beats and makes them not only enjoyable to listen to but very fun to dance to. Many contemporary electronic artists have a specific type of listener they try and target (as their unique music requires a certain type of person to enjoy, such as Nintendocore). This is not the case with Justice. They are a band that takes musicality and rhythmic precision very seriously. Not only are the songs musically sound and very technical, but also almost all of them induce urges within me to get up and dance.    The first song on their album is called \\"Genesis\\". The song itself has a loud introduction, which sets the tone for the rest of the album, as most of the songs are very energetic and fast-paced. The timpani rolls provide a dark yet epic introduction, also foreshadowing the style of most songs on the album. After the introduction of the song, a sinister melody is played. Besides this melody, the faint sound of a girl saying \\"yeah\\" can be heard in the background. The subtleties in this song excited me as I started to appreciate the amount of work that must have gone into making details like that sound good while still fitting with the song. At this point, I started to have high hopes for the album and listened intently for more intricacies.   The second song on the album is titled \\"Let There be Light.\\" Before discussing this song, something that should be noted about dancing in a party or night club setting (where Justice's songs are primarily played) is that people are just trying to have fun and are normally not worried about the technicalities of their moves. The flexible nature of some songs on this album mimics this approach, allowing the lenient and lack-of-restrictions mentality that people have when dancing at parties or nightclubs. \\"Let There be Light\\" is a perfect example of this. In this song, Justice is able to make gritty sounds enjoyable to listen and dance to. The beat is very precise, yet the loose, wavering sound in the background gives the song a feeling of freedom. All the distinct melodies come together very nicely as a testament to Justice's musical precision. When all these elements come together, it creates a great recipe for dancing.   The third song on the album is named \\"D.A.N.C.E\\". Using children to sing the vocals gives this song a very playful feeling. The introduction has children telling the listener to dance, giving the song a very innocent tone. Despite this innocence, once the beat kicks in it's hard to resist the urge to dance like there's no tomorrow. There is a lot of bass guitar here, which gave the song an aura of funk. This contributes towards the urge to dance. There is a nice integration of both piano and electronically generated sounds that would make both Schaeffer and Stockhausen proud.   The fifth song on the album is called \\"Phantom.\\" This song is a perfect example of how Justice is able to blend musical elements from disco, techno and rock. There are many distinct sounds that can be heard in this song. The introduction uses a keyboard and some sounds that are electronically generated. It gives the song a sinister feel, which is further supported by the beat that starts later on. The bass line also helps contribute to the ominous tone of the song, but also gives it the funky texture to constitute this as a song to dance along with.   Not every song on this album evoked an urge to dance from me. Justice stays true to the other traditional use of music, which is for pure listening entertainment. The seventh song \\"Valentine\\" is the first song to stray from this album's dance theme. It starts off yet again with the ominous tone, but I see this more as a transition from the sixth song, which had a dark feel to it. Once \\"Valentine's\\" base melody started, I realized this was more of an easy-listening song. The beat is slowed by a considerable amount and the melody is more playful than the earlier songs. The pitches of the notes are also higher and this gives the song a bouncy and blissful feeling. I thought this song was a nice change of pace from the fast-paced, sinister sounding songs that evoked feelings of excitement from me. I'm guessing that Justice wanted the entire album to be played continuously (because of their perfect transitions between songs) and that \\"Valentine\\" is meant to serve as a break from the energized first half of the album.   But Justice's talents do not lie purely in their musicianship. The eighth song on the album is called \\"Tthhee Pparrttyy\\" and is a good example of Justice's lyricism. The beginning of the song has a synthesizer playing chords very slowly while a hi-hat plays on the offbeat to keep the rhythm. The simplicity of the music made me focus on the lyrics which were very well crafted and although the overall tone of the song seemed very relaxed, the lyrics made me want to go and party. I felt that this was intentional because during the middle of the song, the familiar beat and sinister bass line started up again, meaning that it is time to dance.   The best thing about this album is that the transitions between songs are seamless, yet each song played independently still sounds great. This makes listening to the entire album in one sitting an amazing experience. This album elevates the listening experience, as well as electronic music, to a whole new level.
1439163154|2.0|I am a big fan of James Franco, but this collection of short stories didn't quite deliver for me. The writing isn't bad, the sex and violence is graphic, but the stories are rather hopeless. I was left feeling a bit dirty instead of satisfied or wanting more after each read.

B004CIIXC8|3.0|**1/2. FISH TANK earned a lot of awards so I can't refrain myself from thinking that the overall quality of today cinema is rather low. Not that FISH TANK is bad but, hey!, the story is far from being original, the life of the British underclass sinister as usual and the director of photography seems to suffer from Parkinson's disease at times. Nonetheless, the film can be recommended to curious movie lovers.

The graphics pixelate, the audio has static and will not launch  anywhere but from the carousel.  I hope this gets fixed as this is a great game.  It's just not ready for the Kindle Fire yet.  UPDATE:  Installed v 1.36 and everything appears to be fixed.  All of the above  problems seem to be resolved.  Again, this is a great app.  Fallen Tree customer  service is A++.

It appears the worst one was choosing Isaacson to write his biography . It is the most disconnected, fragments of information ever presented as literature. Facts are  condensed without continuity nor elaborated satisfactorily, flip- flopping throughout. It is no wonder Isaacson is no longer employed by those to whom he referred in his preface.  This embarrassment of what could be a hallmark has turned out to unquestionably be literary feces.

B005V20JKI|5.0|Muffin Knight as the name suggests, you are Knight who collects muffins. I thought the premise was silly and maybe it is but it is a highly entertaining game. You collect muffins and with each muffin you collect you change into another fairytale character. From Knight, Mage, Dragon, Unicorn; even Zombies! The game is set in a few stages where you collect the muffins while killing/avoiding the enemies to rise your high score and your level. Level you say? Yes you do level up and make your characters better and better with each monster killed and each muffin collected you gain experience. Beautiful graphics and  nice sound effects make Muffin Knight an awesome experience, the humor too! If you ever played Donkey Kong or one of the old Game & Watch games and like those type of games, you can't go wrong with this one.  Device: Nook Color
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I ordered this case despite the negative comments about the smell. I noticed a little bit of a \\"new materials\\" smell for the first day, but it quickly dissipated. Since I didn't use the sleeve as a pillow I wasn't bothered by it at all. The Charcoal color is beautifully accented by the faux leather handle and all the seams are tight. The inside material is not as nice as memory foam cases made by incase, but the shallow egg-carton interior does a good job and leaves just enough room for a cleaning cloth.   Done right: Color combination. Build quality. Fit.   Room for improvement: Better interior material. Include microfiber cloth.

B005YDLJ76|2.0|The concert DVD is identical to everything Beyonce has already done.  Time after time, she is repeating the same routines... I for one am tired of it.  Most of the show is devoted to Destiny's Child's music.  Beyonce has enough music of her own to finally stop performing the songs of her former group.  I think it's tacky.  On top of that, there is a little too much video footage being thrown in while the focus should be on what's happening on the stage.  I hope Beyonce has her child, takes a few years and returns with a BRAND NEW act/show leaving Destiny's Child melodies and the same things she's been doing for years now.

B003L77GG0|1.0|I watched Smallville off and on and here of the 10th season being there last.I bought seasons 1-9 and watched them until season 10 started,so I could catch up.Most of the early season so the same way every episode,so you probaly will get tired of watching them,like I did.Someone always gets knocked out and doesn't remember what happened the week before or the book The Art of War gets quoted alot by Lex or Lex's father and the constintly repeating scenes of conflict or make up to break up in one whole episode kinds of things get old.But season 1-9 were very fun and exciting to watched and season 9 was truly amazing with the JSA and all the other specail appearrances throughout.<br /><br />But on to season 10.A very hard season to follow or want to follow.They clearly made this season for everyone from the original cast to come back to say there final goodbyes.Which was nice,even though most of it just seemed like a flip of a switch and there they are,so if you missed even the smallest parts of the episodes.You would be completely lost and with all the people comming back made alot of the episodes for this season seemed half assed or as if they just stopped caring about the show anymore,for example,an entire episode about a very rare bow that they spend an entire episode on,ends up getting destroyed the last 5 minutes of the show or the hangover episode.<br /><br />Where everyone has to find out what happened the night before,which that episode was very lame.I also hate that that there was no main villian that has anything to do with the story at all.Just shadows of the actual person or clones or body switches instead of the clear cut villain like Lex or Zod were in the past.Darksied would just send his lackies to do most if not all his dirty work,which made him look like a giant pussy.It was like he had something better to do because it didn't seem like he got very involved in what was going on.<br /><br />It all comes down to two things.After 10 season of constint focus was on the Clark Kent's character and not Superman,but in later seasons,Clark gets called the blur,which finally starts separating the Clark/Superman \\"the blur\\" dynamic alittle.But in season 10 they just seem to cram the full change of Clark being a nerd,who can't do anything and Superman \\"the blur\\" doing all the things he can do overnight and no one noticed the huge changed and thought it wouldn't be odd,but all of the other characters must have gotten knocked out and forgotten the past 9 years of there lives.But the last,but most important,the whole flying thing.I honestly thought season 10 was finally the season where he would fly.Not on the very last episode and for a very short time on the last episode.<br /><br />To me it just seemed like they were giving the middle finger to all the superman fans,I always pictured superman being the strongest and most powerful hero out there,but in recent years in animation as well as live action,he would rather root for the Batmans or Green Arrow characters because for the least powerful characters they seem to fair alot better than Superman,who get controlled by the villian or knocked out or kidnapped or something stupid like that and in live action does extremely well only not do extremely badly later on.haracter and not Superman,but in later seasons,Clark gets called the blur,which finally starts separating the Clark/Superman \\"the blur\\" dynamic alittle.But in season 10 they just seem to cram the full change of Clark being a nerd,who can't do anything and Superman \\"the blur\\" doing all the things he can do overnight and no one noticed the huge changed and thought it wouldn't be odd,but all of the other characters must have gotten knocked out and forgotten the past 9 years of there lives.But the last,but most important,the whole flying thing.I honestly thought season 10 was finally the season where he would fly.Not on the very last episode and for a very short time on the last episode.

B0054N73EY|5.0|There are some poor reviews on here from people who don't like this album because it's not Mother Milkian enough or something.

0553801473|3.0|This is the fifth in a series of volumes, and it could have really been condensed into half the number of pages.  Has too many POVs of minor characters, and no plot advancement.  I think GRRM has lost his way and has no idea how to reconcile all the subplots as well as the major plot.  He does seem to kill off a lot of major characters.  It makes it easy for him to end figuring out how they would act in the future.  1000 pages a book are not necessary.  He needs a good editor, and people will still buy his books.

142311339X|5.0|So at the time I read this book, I hadn't yet read the Percy Jackson series by the same author.  I own all five books in that series, but I stopped reading them after the first one.  I can't really say why.  I picked up this book on the sole strength of how much I love the books in the Kane Chronicles by Rick Riordan.<br /><br />Can I just say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book?  I can't really say that this book is better than the original Percy Jackson series as I haven't read them yet, but in my opinion, this book can hold it's own.<br /><br />I could not stop giggling when I read this book.  The humor in this book, just as it was in the Kane Chronicles, just didn't stop.  I am not really sure what it is about the Satyr's that makes them so funny, but it just works.  Give that satyr a bit of a complex and a megaphone and the hilarity just doesn't stop.<br /><br />One thing I did appreciate about this book was not only the introduction of new characters, but the fact that each chapter or two was told from a different viewpoint.  I find that with these stories, getting the different view points works very well as each character has their own part to play in the story.  The best part of this book and in fact this series, is that not only does it get kids excited to read, but it teaches them quite a lot about mythology and in terms that they can understand.
1423101472|5.0|This book is my favourite book - though the other four are one, two, three and six (I'll let you ponder which is six . . .).   These books are the roots for my love of Greek Mythology; ask anyone that knows me, and they'll tell how obssesed I am. I recommended these books to others; and, low and behold, they loved them too. Rick Riordan is a splendid writer, and not once did I think it was too hard to believe. Even got me thinking about my Faith. And, of course, no girl can resist the romance between Percy and Annabeth. And, they can't help but have a small crush on Percy . . .   Over all, this book is fabulous, as are the others.
0525423656|3.0|I really, really did not like Matched, but as a follow up Crossed was actually pretty decent.  I ended up  reading both books back to back so I was able to keep going with the story.  As a result, I really can't help but compare the two books.<br /><br />I must say that I enjoyed the setting in Matched much more.  For me, having the characters leave the city for the Outer Provinces lends credibility to the whole Dystopian aspect.  I felt that it gave Crossed a sense of danger and excitement that I found was lacking in Matched.  There were so many plot twists that I found myself unable to predict what was going to happen next; something that I greatly enjoyed.<br /><br />Once I got used to them, I loved the differing viewpoints.  In my opinion, it really helped keep the story from revealing itself too soon.  Plus it was really nice to get a look inside of Ky's mind.  I found his viewpoint to be very refreshing and almost pure in his feelings.  Plus, it was a bonus to have male characters, who while very different from one another, were not absolute morons.  It was so nice to just finally get some decent male love interests.  I am really tired of this whole trend in YA of girls always falling for the pining after the controlling jerk.  Kudos to Ally Condie for creating two different male characters in Xander and Ky who aren't actually jerks masquerading as the ideal choice.<br /><br />I have to say, that now I am kind of bummed that I have to wait a whole year to find out just how this series ends.<br /><br />*A copy of the book was provided in exchange for a fair and honest review*

1451627289|5.0|It's been awhile since I've literally found myself unable to put down a book.  Had this with me EVERYWHERE, and read it into the wee hours.  I just loved it so much.  The world of 1958 that Stephen King creates is just so vivid, and every little detail of this story made me smile or shudder.  Not a single wayward moment in the GEM of a novel.<br /><br />I really also loved the main character, our narrator, Jake Epping.  What a wonderfully voiced character to lead us through this journey.<br /><br />It's fantastic how SK doesn't waste much time on the HOW of getting back to the past in this novel, because it isn't the point.  There's a fabulous story to tell, and so he just provides the vehicle for time-travel that the character needs so we can get on with the story.  No fooling around with paradoxes, the usual time travel gobbledygook either.  And the whole thing about the past NOT WANTING to change was very, very cool.  Only the Master could have written this book...so glad he did!
1594202842|5.0|What a well-written book, Amy Chua is funny, insightful, self-depreciating and totally entertaining.  I couldn't put it down, finished it all in one read.  She is telling a story about how she raised her kids, what worked well and what didn't, and how she grew in the process.  There is a fantastic \\"Afterwards\\" where she discusses going through early drafts of the book with her kids, how she changed things based on their feedback and how at the end of it all no one is completely happy with how they're portrayed.<br /><br />There is something to be said for pushing your kids hard so that they learn what they're capable of, and there's something to be said for knowing when enough is enough.  Seems like she's still figuring out the right balance, like all parents.

A sad, somber story that I don't indulge in when reading. The reason I read these kinds of books is to escape reality a bit not to be depressed. Sparks needs to take a break and recharge. Writing a new book every year seems too many.

1904994679|5.0|Dreams and laughter are built with the \\"Guinness World Records.\\" I know. I grew up dreaming to be included, to have accomplished some astonishing stunt or to have achieved an incredible level of physical prowess. And I laughed at the ridiculous obsessions of some of those who made it.<br /><br />I'm not in it. I tried a few times with some community events in which the most people to do certain things all at once. Inevitably, we would have far too few participants to impress the editors at \\"Guinness World Records.\\" It was wonderful to try.<br /><br />Now, the internet satisfies a lot of my curiosities about the bizarre things people do, but the value of this book remains: to serendipitously discover the amazing people in this world. Real people do these things, and are verified by the book's staff.<br /><br />Every dentist office, auto fix-it shop, and home coffee table needs a copy of this. Readers won't mind waiting quite as much.<br /><br />--Brockeim
B006470HZ6|3.0|*No Spoilers*  Although season one of this series was fantastic, season two brings a good first episode, but it's a slow decline from there. The occasional suspenseful scene will appear, but for me, there was too much standing around talking and arguing in an illogical manner. It takes approximately 3 episodes to accomplish each task. Season just seems to move incredibly slow. Hopefully the pickup of the season next year brings the show...back from the dead.
B003EYVY04|3.0|My friends call me a colletor. Really I'm a perfectionist. When I fall in love with a series I want to own the best of it in perfect condition. When I heard of these ultimate editions I immediatly jumped onto Amazon and ordered the first two. Of course first researching greatly to make sure they were the best. They were outstanding and greatly enhanced my Harry Potter watching experience. Best of all they had everything; character cards, extended editions, commentaries, picture books... oh it was glorious. I completely satisfied. So I foolishly broke my own rule and bought the next two editions without my usual extensive reshearch. Ah dissapointment, these next two had only three disks and were cheaply made. And they were missing the best part. The extended edition. Well I had already bought them but am now unsatified and will have to get the better and true ultimate edition, when and if it ever comes out. Until then, my current unsatisfactory editions go into the trash. 60 wasted dollars. If you are a perrfectionist like me and want the true ultimate editions of Harry Potter years 3 and 4 DO NOT BUY NOW. However I do strongly suggest years 1 and 2. REPEAT, RUN FAR FAR AWAY FROM ULTIMATE EDITIONS 3 and 4. Save your hard earned money. I will not be puchasing ultimate editions 5 and 6 until they include everything they should. If you must own the Harry Potter movies now, get the Blue ray box set with all 8 disks which is nothing but the movies in beautiful blure ray. I will be waiting for the true ultimate editions and will never break my rule of reshearching, ever again.

B004LROUNG|3.0|This will be the last Grisham book I buy pre publication. I will still buy them but I can certainly wait until the paperback version because thats what this is.... PULP FICTION. It was entertaining but probably did not take much longer to write than it did to read.<br />Harvard lawyer gets drunk and joins a loser lawfirm from an ad he sees on a passing bus? Get serious!!! UNbelievable scenarios throughout and totally lacking the John Grisham talent of his earlier books.
0896762173|5.0|Great book though no pattern included. Unlike books by Ms. Frances Grimble, at first glance, you may find the content of this book a bit messy since 95%of which are draft hand drawings with notes all around the pictures. But when you look into them you will love this book.  What the content shows is just as the title of the book \\"Costume in Detail\\".<br /><br />The author even mentions the shade and motif of the dress. However, since her drawings are so rough, it is not easy to imagine what the real patterns and colours are like.<br /><br />Since there is no pattern included, it would be perfect to have Ms. Grimble's pattern books and books with real photos or fine drawings of that era in hand.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This album uses many elements of electronic musical production that I have recently learned about after taking a technosonics course at my university.  Prior to learning about these various techniques, I highly regarded this album as one of my favorites.  I was primarily a listener of hip hop at the time that I picked it up, and now that I have ventured into more experimental music, I can still say that this is one of my favorite albums.    When looking at the musical aspects of this album, it's obvious that Radiohead was trying to create a piece that was modern, and in a way, it serves a snapshot into the state of computer music.  Using various effects throughout their songs, the band was capable of creating an experience that is great at affecting the listener emotionally.  With the opening track 15 Step, the band was able to make an artificial drum circle with the use of pan on the percussion in the background.  While using both live drums and artificial drum sounds, I was able to get the impression that all elements of the rhythm were being performed in the space around me.  Later on in Nude, the band convinces me that they are worth listening to.  The song was beautifully crafted using reverb on nearly all of the background parts, while having Thom's voice stand out above these parts.  Although it's probably known at this point, Thom's voice was reversed during the first thirty seconds or so of this song, and later on, this sample is brought back into the song and played normally.  Little touches like this are what made me a fan of this band.    After listening to this album, I realized that they have a creative process that pushes them to make songs that aren't bound by normal conventions.  They have an ability to make sounds that catch you by surprise, and keep you wondering what you are listening to.  Like in Videotape, for example, when the band takes a percussive sample and applies some effect to it that I still can't put my finger on.  It almost sounds asif they phased the output from its reverb and let this play out over the sample.  Nonetheless, I feel that Raiohead's musicianship that supports this creative process, rather than the opposite. In contrast to some their previous pieces, I appreciated the sense of consistency in this album.  As an example, I enjoyed Amnesiac quite a bit, but in this album, the band diverges from their use of artificial sounds more than I am comfortable with.  In Rainbows, however, uses both live sounds with digital processing to make an album that feels consistent, as all of the songs fit well with one another.  Although the melodic aspects of this album are still fun to listen to, I have always appreciated the strange subjects that are brought up.  At this time, this band provides albums that are experimental, but not too abstract that they can't still be fun.  Needless to say, I'm going to be listening to this album for years to come.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to discover upon receiving this that it included a DVD/Digital Copy disc as well as the Blu Ray disc.  I was not expecting that (but very much appreciated it).
B005K8QIS0|5.0|I sincerely hope the producers of this series continue with it.  It is one of the best detective, mystery series I've seen.  Jason Isaacs does a great job playing the determined yet seriously unhappy P.I. in this series. Love the location, love the writing, just plain love it.
B005I64U5C|5.0|I originally saw the Green Lantern movie in the theater last summer when it was first released, in 3D, and I enjoyed it very much. The storyline was okay enough, and the acting by all was done well, but I thought the action scenes and special effects were great, and the 3D was truly awesome. Ryan Reynolds did a really good job as the hero, Hal Jordan, and Peter Sarsgaard as the antagonist Hector Hammond was really good too, and Mark Strong as the Green Lantern Corps leader, Sinestro was excellent. I hope they make a sequel so that I can see more of Sinestro and what he plans to do with the power of the yellow ring of fear. This movie overall was pretty cool and a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />So since I recently obtained a 3D TV and 3D Blu Ray player this year, I've been getting more and more into 3D movies for home viewing and I decided to buy the Green Lantern 3D Blu Ray, which also came with a regular Blu Ray version of the movie, and a DVD version of the film as well, and I placed an order with Amazon because this movie seems to be kinda hard to find in the stores around my area. And I have to say that I am very happy with my purchase. Amazon shipped the item to me promptly and it arrived in great shape.<br /><br />Let me tell you, if you are a 3D movie enthusiast like I am, then do not hesitate, buy this movie...it looks spectacular in 3D! I enjoyed the look of the 3D effects so much in this film that I watched it a couple of times already and can't wait to watch it again this weekend. It's just an all-around great 3D movie experience to enjoy at home with your friends and family.
0446547603|4.0|This was my first Nicholas Sparks book, and I enjoyed it very much! I have to say though, it's kind of slow in the first half of the book with character development and the building up of the heroine's secret past.  Starting half way into the book, OMG you just can't put the book down.  I won't spoil the suspense that comes with the heroin's past.  It's not a suspense of something good being done, rather something horrible, and it is written in such a way that makes your body go rigid, and your heart literally starts pumping.  I highly recommend!!
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I'm finding this review so hard to write mostly because of how much I LOVED this book! This was one of those books that sucked me in from the very first page. Stephanie Perkins has a way of writing a book that makes you to feel what her characters are feeling. She makes you love the people that they love, and hate the ones that they hate.<br /><br />While reading AATFK I was IN Paris. I don't know if Perkins has ever been to Paris or if she just did her research VERY well, and really how would I know cuz I've never been to Paris, but she wrote it just the way I imagine Paris to be. I also loved that she didn't throw in all the usual places you read about. I mean they were in there to a degree, but she focused more on the things you would want to find if you were living there and not just visiting.<br /><br />Anna was a great character even when she was being annoying and unreasonable she was so real. I felt like she was my friend that was driving me crazy, and not just a book character I was reading about. As my friend I wanted her to be happy, and get the guy. Then Perkin's went and wrote this amazingly flawed character, St. Claire. I really couldn't help myself from falling for him.  Even though he made me so mad sometimes I couldn't help but adore him, it was easy to see why Anna was so head over heels for him.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins just became one of those authors for me that I will have to read every book she writes as soon as it's released!
1606863622|5.0|I just finished the book, and the ending isn't what I had in mind but the way Sparks ended it makes it that much more unforgettable and leaves us with a strong emotion.  You must read it and feel for yourself the aching in your heart.  I especially love the relationship between John and his father.  A father son relationship isn't something I would find amusing, but this one is special.  It is beautifully written, and I love how Sparks uses letters as a way of communication.  I was able to understand from deep down inside the feelings portrayed in the letters.  It's funny how you get so much more from a written letter than from a conversation in person.  I highly recommend!

B005Z271Y6|5.0|There's an incredible moment near the end of the concert, where Adele, overwhelmed with emotion and the support of the crowd, starts crying after singing \\"Someone Like You.\\" The entire Royal Albert Hall immediately givers her a thunderous standing ovation that lasts for quite a while, clearly showing their overflowing love and appreciation for this amazing artist. The look on her face is one of pure heartfelt appreciation. And the crowd can't get enough. None of us can.    It's flabbergasting how talented this young woman is. If you've never seen her live, this is the closest you'll get and you won't be disappointed. I've seen her more times than I can count now, still bought this DVD, and still was blown away. Magnificent.
1577314808|5.0|I find some parts of this book to be a bit goofy and quirky, but over all, this book has really helped me learn how to control my thoughts and emotions.  I recommend it to family and friends regularly.  I don't take everything he says seriously, but there are certain parts that are wonderful.  I also have the audio book which has been great for when I am having trouble sleeping due to anxiety.  If you've read lots and lots of self help or inspirational or spiritual books, maybe it's not for you... but if you have anxiety and could use some tools for experiencing life with a new perspective that could alleviate anxiety, then it's definitely worth a read or several.
0857685570|4.0|Most pictures are very faint and don't show the sharpness that acryclic and pencil provide. The paintings are about detail, and you really have to focus on some of the images to see it.  The rating is for the artwork, not the prints.   Good book to own if you like quality art.
0060873027|1.0|This is not a book written by Michael Crichton. I have read every single one of his books and nothing in this one is representative of his previous writings. I have read only one book by Richard Preston, and it was one of the best non-fiction books I have read in years: \\"Demon in the Freezer\\" (5 stars). Unfortunately, \\"Micro\\" does not do him justice either.<br /><br />Crichton always wrote in a believable manner. He developed his far out theses with lots of accurate details. His character development was such that you liked or disliked the players, but you were rarely ambivalent. None of that is in this novel. The detail errors just slap you in the face. Such as a botanist, herpetologist, plant chemist, entomologists all occupying the same lab space at Harvard! This will never happen in a million years. They would be on different floors, different buildings. Then when one brother finds a micro airplane and calls the other brother, the response is \\"this is an important application, bring it with you when you come to Hawaii.\\" Yet the other brother was just down the road a mile at MIT. Must not have been that important. Oh, and the guy who can track cell phone calls and RECORDS their conversations! Gimme a break, even Big Brother cannot do that. And it goes on and on. The accurate details were not there to build a pseudofoundation for the plot. And the character development was non-existent. I had no empathy when key players fell by the way side. It was ho hum, who cares. Oh, and when did \\"gone missing\\" or \\"went missing\\" enter the lexicon of literate adults? What happened to \\"is missing\\" or \\"was missing?\\" Strange.<br /><br />No, I felt I was reading the script for a Saturday morning cartoon. Or maybe the next release of Toy Story. I was extremely disappointed in this novel. I'll stick with another reread of \\"The Andromeda Strain.\\"
B000059MEK|5.0|This album truly brings the idea of synthpop to life with each song. Not only does Daft Punk do a good job at making the music interesting, but also they make you feel every beat. Coming from the house music genre, Daft Punk took this route of synthpop, which they have successfully integrated into their music. Synthpop, is the music genre that developed out of the 1980's with the synthesizer being the prominent instrument. The many different kinds of synthesis can be heard in the songs throughout the album, while also combined with other musical instruments. I believe what makes this album successful is the balance that Daft Punk finds in combining such different instruments. Every song is different, yet the elements behind every song become familiar as you progress through the album. However, I found myself always willing to listen to the next song to discover what emotions would be brought up during its duration.  The very first track \\"One More Time,\\" probably one of the duo's biggest hits, warrants me to want to celebrate and party. However, the track \\"Something About Us\\" brings me to think about past relationships with people, and just in general what I hold dear in my life. Nevertheless, the samples and ways in which every track is constructed successfully in terms of what emotions they are trying to convey. Ironically, Daft Punk describes this album as attempt to \\"reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood.\\" There is much truth to this statement, as I've described above, every track brings about a different emotion inside of you.    The history of how such music can come to be really is what should be emphasized in the success of Daft Punk.It's not enough to just have these instruments to make music. It takes thought, recognition, and understanding of what you have at your disposal to make your music. As mentioned before, I believe this is where Daft Punk finds the balance. They not only used synthesizersto create their music, but they used samples, guitars, basses, and human voice. It's the combination of these different tools, and Daft Punk's overall musical genius to make this album a success. In the context of what the synthesizer is capable of, we can all see the result when implemented correctly. However, this way is not the only way the synthesizer can be used to make a successful album. There are a number of other bands and albums that use the synthesizer and other instruments to make their album successful. I fully recommend Discovery to anyone looking to expand his or her musical library. I honestly did not like the \\"technoish house music\\" genre until I listened to Daft Punk. This was my first album that I listened to by them, and I was not disappointed. I'm sure many fans of this genre have already purchased this album. However, for the people who have not listened to this album, I suggest you do so immediately. You will not be disappointed.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Loved the movie - inspired me as a programmer. Had to buy the disc so I could get motivated anytime.
0446547654|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does not disappoint with \\"The Best of Me\\". Although I wish the ending could have been somewhat different, it still was wonderfully written. I can only imagine finding a love as strong as theirs. Definately worth the purchase! I loved it!
B00406UK5A|3.0|This story is a made up one. However there is no doubt that fierce female warriors existed back then. Boudica almost drove the romans out of britain but was defeated , barely defeated that is!  The acting is good here but really this movie is a chase movie in which a group of legionaires try to escape the picts. WHo later became the scots after mixing with the irish scotti people.  The violence is very bloody and realistic but the loss of the legion which here only has three thousand men is far less that the six thousand a legion usually had.  So you get what you get here and good looking chase movie. I didn't like the ending though , because I don't know of any returning soldiers betrayed regardless of losses. That part was not right but the fact remains that this is a decent action flick in many regards. the budget was not that big as  you really don't have that many sets in this feature. But to be fair they did a good job with the pictish village. This is not a terrible movie , it's not great but it's good enough. Historically even 'gladiator' is all wrong, although commodus was one of romes worst emporers he reigned for twelve years! not twelve months. And people love that movie, including me, I wish the filmworld could get it more right in many regards but this is good enough for a watch and you will root for the Romans. yes, they are the heroes in this movie in spite of the fact that they are out for conquest.  And to be fair , once rome was in charge things weren't always totally bad. (years after the initial conquest that is).  So this movie politically upset alot of people! I don't care; if I was alive back then. I would rather live in the roman empire than outside of it. The blu ray looks great here and only has one extra feature , a audio commentary. I would say if you want a nice little action flick this is a good one to watch.

B0038AL7EW|1.0|DeeVeeDee ought to be banned from your site for misleading customers. This BD does not play in BD players sold in the US market. Why not state that clearly?

0545265355|5.0|I want to start my review out by saying ignore the 7-15 people that give this book a bad review.  Their comments either don't apply to this book (which means they shouldn't have scored it) or they are saying that its too graphic (mostly for kids).  Tell me, if you don't like gore why would you even bother reading the book after reading the plot? Let me tell you also yes there was murder and death but you see these things much more detailed in movies now days, it wasn't as bad as they say. All their comments aside I finished the whole series in 3 days and I thought these books were fantastic.  My favorites definately go in order but by the time you get through the second book you have to finish the series.    It's definately a must read-- watch the trailer for the movie and tell me it doesn't make you want to read the book.

B005ZUR724|3.0|Due to a recent upgrade to address account security issues this game no longer runs on Fire as well as other Android devices. The server requires an updated version but the update does not download.  Game Loft says they are working on a fix but after nearly 24 hours there is still no fix. One has to wonder about GLs testing process to let something this simple get out. Given that this is a monthly subscription game I would advise waiting until a fix is available before purchasing.  UPDATE: 12.2.2011  It appears that you can delete the game and reinstall and it will work. At least it did for me. Interestingly I didn't see any official notification of this on their forum site. I do see people still having issues with logging in so maybe they'll see this and get it working with a reinstall.  I give the game 3 stars, it's pretty fun especially on a tablet but I don't see myself playing this on my home computer. It's a fun mobile game for me.

B004DTLK62|1.0|I LOVE the movie, let's be clear about that.  I currently own the 15th Anniversary Edition on standard DVD, and wanted to purchase a Blu-Ray to go with our upgraded TV and player.  Unfortunately, the order I placed with third party iNetVideo Fufillment for the BLU RAY version (advertised here) went awry.  Although the description and picture CLEARLY state this is a Blu-ray disc you are ordering, I recieved a STANDARD DVD (definitely NOT what I ordered).  I'm not sure if the company doesn't understand that the two are not the same, or if the workers in charge of packaging do not, but this kind of mistake is certainly a glaring one.  I will be getting a refund through Amazon.  This is either a communication mix up within the company, or deceptive advertising (if someone thinks that no one is going to notice the difference between a Blu Ray and DVD - that's insane - esp. since you can get a standard DVD of the same movie for HALF the price)!  BEWARE![[ASIN:B004DTLK62 Chaplin (15th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]]

B003YI3D4K|5.0|This recording of the 2nd concerto has been released on CD 3 times, as far as I know. This is the most recent release and has been remastered using Sony's current best methods, so it should be better than the other two (from [[ASIN:B000003EUL 1993]] and [[ASIN:B0002DD5U2 2004]]). There is also an [[ASIN:B005FWAHKQ MP3 download]] on Amazon, but I doubt that it is the same remastered version as on this CD. I don't have the others to compare, but I think this CD sounds very good for 1960.  The performance of the concerto is very exciting overall. I think they picked just the right tempo for the last movement and keep the mood pretty light. I have heard a few other recordings where the last movement drags, causing the entire piece to feel even longer than it already is. The Beethoven sonata is also well played. I think I prefer this rendition to Horowitz's on Sony from the 1960s, but I haven't listened to them side by side yet.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This cover is form fitting to the kindle and hardly adds to the weight of the device. It is not intrusive and makes a great stand for hands free viewing.

1597801577|4.0|The Windup Girl depicts a world in which cloning is not only permitted, but has become common place. The clones are genetically altered so that their movement is not smooth or graceful and this betrays their artificial status. The author has touched upon sensitive issues, such as racial abuse, from our own world in this high-tech science fiction novel.<br /><br />The novel starts slow, and builds suspense from the beginning, yet remains interesting enough that it's hard to put down... and it gets better as the reader turns the pages. Many of the characters are only superficially developed, and these would have been more interesting if they had been developed more in-depth. The Windup Girl is not a \\"fluffy\\" read and requires concentration from the reader to fully understand what's happening. In fact, one almost needs to take notes at a few points because a lot happens in the story.<br /><br />In the end, I felt I needed to deduct one star for the sometimes lengthy and apparently unnecessary descriptive passages in which little is happening to further the ends of this otherwise interesting tale.<br /><br />This review, for which I have not received any financial compensation, has been posted on Dragon Views, Amazon.com and LibraryThing.
0802130208|5.0|To be honest, I'm not quite finished with this book, but I already know that is one of my favorite works that I have written. The character of Ignatius J. Reilly is so unbelievably ridiculous it cannot be easily summed up in an Amazon review. This is how a comedic novel is supposed to be written and I find it hard to be mesmerized at how short these 300 pages I have read have seemed to go by. Excellent Read.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|THANKS FOR THE GREAT DVD MY FAVORITE SHOW TO HAVE FOR EVER. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND FOR ANY FAN OF CHUCK.
1400069181|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! I'm in college right now, so I can't exactly start a philanthropic business right now, but I did really enjoy reading more of the back story behind the brand TOMS. I think that even if you don't want to start a business, you can still take away a great sense of what doing things for others can do to change the world. I would totally recommend this book to someone who wants to model their business after TOMS, or even someone who is just really passionate about what companies like TOMS do!
B005K17RU0|1.0|It seems the \\"current\\" weather data is hours old. AccuWeather says it's 43 degrees outside, my weather station at home, and the nearby airport,  reports it's 59. Even the forecasts the next day are wrong by about half that amount. I just can't trust what it says.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|Cover does not stand like an easel as shown. The cover slips out of the groove with the slightest touch and collapses flat. You need a prop to stand it up. Cover and design is sleek and protects.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I haveen't read Grisham in awhile , but thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Te story was fun to read and I love the legal maneuvering.
B00092ZL80|1.0|Earth Wind and Fire band performance is GOOD.  But, Chicago without Peter Cetera is not really Chicago. Their band performance is POOR.
B003X5UFWW|1.0|Terrible, terrible acting. Ludicrous sets. Totally made-up/re-write of history. I really don't understand the point in making this movie. If they did want to do a martial arts movie, why claim (falsely) that it was based on a real person's life? Dude, he wasn't even in Foshan during the war.  BTW, read Wikipedia before flaming me.  edit:  OK, don't trust Wikipedia or anything else written about him on the 'net. Still a crap movie that revises history and with wooden,stereotypical acting. As someone else commented \\"It's a mainland propaganda film, what do you expect\\".
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is amazing. If you love Plants vs Zombies on the computer or X Box you will love this. Pretty much exactly the same game but in your pocket.
B004RWYNT6|5.0|There really is no reason not to buy this album. It is rock solid, and then some. Excellent vocals, paired with killer guitars... I don't know how to put the greatness into words.  If you are a fan of heavy classic rock, or stoner rock, then you can't go wrong with Graveyard. \\"No Good, Mr. Holden\\", \\"Hisingen Blues\\", and \\"Uncomfortably Numb\\" alone are worth the album price.
B0043GAZYS|1.0|I'm not going to go into a lengthy review of this as many others have - just give you an adult mom's of a 13 y/o daughter opinion of the movie : AWFUL and 2 thumbs down. The characters acting was juvenile, the \\"hero\\" (Scott Pilgrim)a total unbelievable dork (if that was the point, than it was cast very well), the girl who played Ramona Flowers was disgusting, as was the Asian girl who was CrAzY in love with Scott (you have GOT to be kidding me). My 13 y/o had this on while we sorted thru her sock drawer (me doing most of the sorting, her watching this trash), and believe me, the sock sorting was A+ compared to this mindless drivel. This movie was horrid - please don't waste your money adding it to your DVD collection. Watch it thru Netflix or on the net if your that curious.
1594481938|4.0|A Long Way Down is a book about four people contemplating suicide.  The first half is the strongest part, perhaps  because it is the funniest part, but Hornby keeps the characters and the story going throughout.  The focus is on the four characters, and the reactions and interactions of those close to the four makes the bond that develops between JJ, Jess, Martin, and Maureen believable.  But there isn't anything easy about the book -- no easy answers, nobody is all good or all bad, people muddle through.  It's almost a throwback to 60s books like Slaughterhouse Five or The Floating Opera, which incorporate similar themes and conclusions in humorous/tragic ways.  Worth reading.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|It's too bad next season will be the last. Everything about the series is high quality.  Looking forward to seeing how this all turns out in the end.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is an awesome album. I can listen to it from start to finish, over and over. This has quickly become one of my favorites.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I thought I would read it over the Thanksgiving weekend. Instead I couldn't help but finish it two weeks before. Steve Jobs is compelling to me because he is in many ways the opposite of what a Good Corporate Citizen is supposed to be. Antagonistic. Instinctual. Rash. Emotional. I wonder if it is possible for any company to do great work if the people within it cannot show up each day as their whole selves, warts and all. Thanks, Steve, for being a business human.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|When I heard the first song I felt my stomach turning and by the third song I went into a full sprint to the toilet and violently threw up. First of all this cd is rude and offensive and not because of foul language, but because the vocals, the music and the whole idea behind this is a disgusting mess. The review from Shannon Crowley is spot on - we as good humans should warn people from this disgraceful display of noise. This is basically steeling from people and Metallica should post a website where fans can be reimbursed. Just like that bitch Lars was crying about Napster, fans are now crying about Metallica hoodwinking us fans into buying this fecal matter coming through my speakers. I don't really write reviews, but when I was cleaning up my vomit, I decided I had to write one for this piece of crap.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Great book, still haven't finished it but, it completelly shows the mind of a genius!!! Great book written by a great author!
B005HSG3VK|1.0|My Kindle fire keeps disconnecting from the internet when I have this cover on it. I used the kindle fire before I got the cover and I had no problem connecting to the internet.  The cover blocks the signal.
B002BWP49C|3.0|So I have seen all the other Twilight movies and have enjoyed them for exactly what they are: campy, mildly entertaining fantasy romance melodrama.  I have not read the books, but knew what to expect plot-wise from this movie thanks to every magazine, news show, and email homepage that insisted on spilling Twilight \\"secrets\\" and ruining it for those of us who wanted to - I don't know - SEE what happens in the movie instead of having it's details babbled to us.  Anywho . . .  The Good:    There were a few very honest moments in the movie that I appreciated.  1) Bella being very nervous about her first sexual rendezvous with her new husband.  On many of these teen shows and movies, people just hop into bed like it's no big deal.  How they played this scene out, how tastefully it was done and the fact that they waited 'til marriage was beautiful and honorable. 2) Bella examining herself in the mirror the next morning through new de-virginized eyes. 3)  Flashbacks of Bella's life as she is dying/in the process of being changed into a vampire.  It really gives you the sense that one life is ending and another is beginning; it's a rebirth.  I also like that Jacob [Taylor Lautner] got a lot more screen time.  I started off the series being \\"Team Edward\\" but am now squarely \\"Team Jacob\\".  He's a waaaaaay better character than Edward: strong, assertive, and, uh . . . actually still alive!  Of course the tanned six-pack doesn't hurt either.  ;)  Some of the special effects were good (Bella's back breaking, making her look even thinner when sick and pregnant, her transformation to vamp).  I love how smartly they ended the movie (with a split-second shot of Bella's new vampire eyes).  It definitely leaves you wanting to know what happens next and what the new Bella is like:  How strong will she be?  What special abilities will she have?  And most importantly . . . will her acting skills improve?    The Bad [better pull up a chair for this part]:  Obviously, watching a movie about fictional creatures (vampires & werewolves) requires one to exercise a certain amount of suspended disbelief, but there were elements that were downright ridiculous (100+ year old dead guy impregnating someone), and MANY things that were inconsistent from movie-to-movie.      Exhibit A:  When did Edward stop sparkling in the sunlight?  Is this explained in the book? Sure, there were plenty of scenes where the weather was overcast, but how about when Edward and Bella were on a beach in broad daylight?  I thought Edward's skin was supposed to be like diamonds - I guess when he's in a committed relationship he downgrades to cubic zirconium.    Exhibit B:  The characters personalities are inconsistent from movie to movie.  In the first two Tilight films, Jasper was played like in immature newbie vampire that was wrestling with his vegetarianess.  Now all the sudden he's mature?  His Southern accent seems to come and go as it pleases too.    Exhibit C:  The werewolves seem to have shrunk dramatically.  In the last movie, they appeared to be the size of clydesdale horses.  In Breaking Dawn, they look roughly the size of your neighborhood guard dog.  Not to mention the fact that they have entire conversations [telepathically, of course] in wolf form.  Felt like they'd spliced in a scene from that Zookeeper movie with Kevin James.  More badness . . .  A VERY out-of-place cheesy wedding reception scene, chock full of sit-comy toasts from Bedwards' [Bella/Edwards] friends and family.  I *almost* appreciate the attempt at adding some levity early on since the audience knows the movie will take a dark turn.  But the result is awkward.  Three words:  BELLA'S.  WEDDING.  DRESS.  This was the most truly awful, cheap-looking garment I have ever seen in a film wedding in my life.  I can't believe this was designed by Carolina Herrera.  They must've run out of money after making all those cgi werewolves.  It looked like the spandex leotard from a Halloween costume left in the clearance bin at the dollar store.  Now if stick-figure Kristen Stewart couldn't make it look flattering, I can't imagine what it would like on a woman who actually eats breakfast.  The sad part is, there is a scene where Bella dreams about the wedding before it happens, and the dress in the dream [different dress] is STUNNING.  What happened to *that* dress - was it too fancy for the conscious Bella Swan?  And for the worst part . . .  Jacob \\"imprints\\" on Bella's half-vampire baby, Renesmee.  Yes - that's right - an 18-YEAR-OLD dude falls instantly in love . . . with a newborn.  Should I call the police, or will you do it?   Despite the cheese factor, the long, slow chunk of the movie that was spent on the honeymoon scenes, and the inconsistencies, will I still see BD Part 2?  Sure.  Why?  Because it's likely to be much better than BD Part 1, which is the weakest of the Twilight films.  And best case scenario, I might finally get an answer as to why a vampire and a werewolf would fight over a girl who has no life goals (other than to die), and constantly appears as though she is experiencing severe menstrual cramps.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|this movie is awsome. it has action, it has style ( the seen with the bike and the plane is so cool, not to mention the burning bedroom scene ^.^ ) and it has characters that are not just cliches but characters you can like, even the female character Aisha, played by the fierce Zoe Saldana is great. neither is she the the bombshell in distress waiting to be rescued nor is she the evil she-devil waiting to bring the hero down.   I absolutely recommend this movie for everybody who likes action with lots of personality.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I saw this game on ipod and was hoping it would be on amazon for my kindle fire and I absolutely love it but I'm done all of the levels and want more!
B0000CABBW|3.0|Good enough movie. My agenda was to learn more about Maori culture. While there were some elements of this culture in the movie, I did not get a sense of what it means to be part of that culture, and that is what I was looking for.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I was able to take advantage of the 12.99 price on this, which is incredible for what you get.  It's a good movie, and I'll definitely take advantage of the digital copy as well.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I do a lot of rooting and ROM flashing so I am constantly transferring files between my laptop and phone.  this by far the best file sharing apple I have found!  works flawlessly!  and to the people who are crying about it not being secure, this apple is not meant to run 24/7. open it, transfer files and close it out!  and to the idiots that cry about it srltill running, learn what the menu button is and the word &quot;exit&quot; means.  ignorance is no excuse for a bad review.
B0064NTZKI|5.0|After watching this outstanding documentary of Woody Allen's unparalleled career, unprecedented in its access, candor and insight, I was left with an even greater recognition that Mr. Allen is a writer who makes films, not a film-maker who writes. From his earliest one-liners up to the present day, Woody has continued to grow and change, but never at the cost of either his professional integrity or his vision. Perhaps it has served us well that Woody Allen seems to view the majority of his work as either mediocre or as abject failures, for rather than stifling his spirit, such dubious self-analysis seems only to have fueled his ambition and illuminated his vision. And while even I, one of his most ardent fans, would admit that he lost his way occasionally with films such as Curse of the Jade Scorpion or Small-Time Crooks, somehow I always knew that he'd be back.  I've come to feel that some of those comparative underachievements were nothing more than the \\"vacations\\" of a man who has never really taken one. But at his best, there's simply no one better.  From Take the Money and Run, Bananas, Sleeper and Love and Death, to the richer Annie Hall, Mahattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, Purple Rose, Danny Rose, Zelig, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Midnight in Paris (and many others!), Woody Allen has proven that cummulative greatness will ultimately supercede what C&M's Judah Rosenthal called, \\"The superficial pay-off of the moment.\\" To recognize the stature of this incomparable artist, one need only review the list of outstanding actresses, actors and cinematograpers who either have been, or who are waiting to be called for Mr. Allen's next project, sight-unseen.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|game slows down in minutes and it reboots the phone!! sometimes the screen turns black ( bg music still running ) but cant turn on the screen, need battery out to reboot..
0385535139|5.0|This is a fun read; brain candy.  The characters are engaging, the story is interesting, and the conclusion satisfying.  One wishes it ended a bit differently so a sequel might be possible.  Just pick up the book, settle down for a fun ride, and don't be surprised when you begin to chuckle.
0439023521|1.0|Very disappointed with this book as the majority of reviewers have nothing but high praise. This is mind-numbing garbage. Try Tolkien or Martin for true character development.  Stephanie Myers recommends this book, enough said.
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio is absolutely amazing!  After streaming Pandora for quite some time, listening to the same music got extremely boring. With TuneIn, you can have all of your favorite radio stations in the palm of your hand. In addition, this radio station keeps you in touch with the rest of the world; you can find out what music people in different countries listen to and experience their culture. Plus, the sound quality is fabulous. I listen to the radio in England and it is better quality than local radio stations I listen to in the car. It's unbelievable!  This app is wonderful. Download it ASAP! :)
1609611543|5.0|I originally bought on my Kindle and then ordered the hardback so I could share with my family and friends.  After reading \\"Wheat Belly\\" I am so thankful that I have been gluten-free for almost 2 years.  This book helped me understand what the wheat/gluten was doing to my body. As I look back on my health history, I think wheat has been at the root of many problems for many years. I wish every doctor that told me there was nothing wrong with me had this book as mandatory reading.  Dr. Davis really explains all of the negative impacts wheat has on your health. It is hard to comprehend why so many organizations and people keep touting \\"eat more whole grains\\".  Once you have read this enlightening book, you will never look at wheat the same way again.  Dr. Davis has done a wonderful job of educating people about the medical responses and problems with wheat, but he does it in a way that a layman can understand. I recommend this to everyone interested in their health.
B00150VWX8|3.0|This compilation of the most well-known musical moments from Richard Wagner's Ring cycle is a good resource for the most well-known instrumental motifs of the cycle. However, I am of the opinion that another conductor would have maybe enjoyed the job better. Unless the playback speed of this set was increased in error while undergoing digitization, Mr. Maazel seems have confused hurrying through the score with presenting an energetic performance.  And a 'yo-ho-to-ho'-less ride with the Valkyries can never come to a good end. . .<br /><br />(Why buy this when you can get the entire Ring cycle for a dollar less? [[ASIN:B003JFTNKG Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen]] - all 4 complete operas, nearly 15 hours of music, good vocal performances too, the magic and energy is there.)
0385341008|4.0|This story is told through a collection of letters, and I love that creative methodology.  Also, love the optimistic spirit given that the island has just come out of German occupation post-WWII.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This game is fun, and is really unlike any other game I've ever seen. But unfortunately, it seems pretty short. I had gotten to the last level relatively quickly and I hadn't purchased any upgrades for my characters. Now I'm just playing to upgrade my dudes and beat the last level. Overall, I love this game.
0316056863|4.0|This was a fun book - great light beach reading.  Only possible shortcoming is you might not relate to a lot of the content if you are not a woman near Tina Fey's age (which I am).  I did like it, though.
0307408833|4.0|I'm vegan, not gluten-free, and I found this book to be wonderful. First of all, I'm a sucker for a good cover and pretty pictures, which this book has in abundance!! But I've found it to be helpful, because the artfully directed photoshoots actually inspire me to bake the items, even though we all know they'll never come out looking THAT good. But the taste--the obviously more important aspect--is top notch!! I've made a handful of recipes so far, including the Pumpkin spice muffins, the mini agave-sweetened brownie gems (OMG), and the biscuits....they're all amazing!!!  The only critique I have with the book (and the reason I give it four stars) is the rarity and priciness of the ingredients. For a college student's budget, it's not feasible to make these things regularly. But if you make the trek to whole foods, suck it up and buy a bunch of the essential ingredients, you'll be good to go. I just looked through the recipes and bought the ingredients most frequently mentioned that I didn't have (spelt flour, garbanzo-fava bean flour, arrowroot, potato starch, etc). HOWEVER, I have been substituting canola oil for coconut oil (less pricey and way less fattening) for every recipe so far, and they all taste perfectly great. Also, I've used corn starch for the same effect. I've found that the recipes are actually quite substitutable if you don't have every single ingredient on hand (or just have certain preferences).   They're definitely recipes to impress, and you will not regret buying this book! True to the Babycakes theme, every non-vegan I feed my treats to cannot believe they're really vegan. A large step up from substituting smart balance and egg replacer for every non-vegan dessert recipe for sure. DELICIOUS!
1572816112|5.0|This deck is a bit \\"dark\\" but its provocative! I use this deck only for personal readings on myself to explore the subconscious. This deck is like entering into a dream world. Its a very unique deck and you should get it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have had a Kindle for a few years now and absolutely love it! Last year I got a Droid X and discovered that I could use the app to synch from my Kindle and read my books anywhere! I fell in love all over again.   I just got a new Droid Razr and gave my Droid X to my husband who, thus far, had resisted too much technology and didn't have a Smartphone. Long story short, he's now addicted to his Droid. I didn't know until today while I was exploring on Amazon that you didn't have to have a Kindle to use the Kindle App. Now he is excited about downloading books to take with him everywhere since he's a truck driver and on the road all day long with frequent breaks while waiting to get his truck re-loaded. Now we are both very happy campers! :-)
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This app is sleek and very stable. (myTouch 3G Slide and G2) It is PACKED with features - the only complaint I've EVER had about this app is the lack of in-depth how-to. But you can figure out most of the functionality by playing with it. It is so packed, I haven't even uncovered all the ways you can use this app. I just recently discovered you can create a  folder for texting people directly AND rearrange how they're ordered inside!! Love it! I highly recommend this app, especially if you are a customization nut like me. ;)
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Very important book about a mostly overseen issue (from many economists): the correlation between technology and unemployment.  Like it or not but we are heading towards a moneyless society - an open source economy.  And this book clearly shows the path to such a society although it's not even mentioned explicitly in the book.  Great book - highly recommended!
098357670X|5.0|Give an example; demonstrate; show how to practice - That's what education is all about. This book is a terrific learning tool. The only way I see to improve on it is to have Tom Richmond come and sit with you and give feedback on your practice. Additionally, his writing style is entertaining, and the production quality for the book is first-rate. Get this book to learn to caricature or to learn about caricaturing!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|The writings of P.G. Wodehouse are hilarious,genuinely clever, good fun and this collection of Jeeves and Wooster DVDs are just what your mind's eye sees as you read the books. Awesome!
1451648537|2.0|I understand the haste with which the research & interviews and editing and publishing were done. In the beginning of the book it was explained to the reader that after at least two efforts by Stevs Jobs himself, his wife had to contact the author himself to explain the determination & persistance of Steve Jobs in starting this book and the research.<br />I am no critic, Im JUST an avid reader who was so hopeful and looking forward to getting to know Steve Jobs through this memoir of sorts. I WAS EAGER TO DEVOUR THE BOOK AND FOUND MYSELF REPEATEDLY FRUSTRATED. Sadly, the book was all over the place.It was hard to follow, not constistant with either a product roll out or a time line. It seemed to go back and forth and then there would be a scant mention of something the book had long ago passed.<br />Aside from learning that he was a master manipulator,a narcissist and a perfectionist...I was left very disappointed. There was little mention of his family & maybe the family wanted it that way & I respect that privacy, it was obvious to the public how private Steve Jobs was. I just felt like I was lead through nearly 600 pages of Apple facts, a cast of crew I was challenged to keep up with and very little outside Apple facts figures & Mr Jobs insistance on perfection and intolerance of anything less. Intentionally maybe that is all Steve Jobs had room for in his life. Maybe Im equally disapppointed that Steve Jobs, albeit a genius, is not a likeable man.<br />I struggled with this book. I probably had too high a hopes.
142313866X|4.0|I have not had an opportunity to read this book thoroughly, but this series seems to cover the details that my company is most interested in, and I'm glad to have an opportunity to add it to our little library of resource materials.

B00007E7K0|5.0|We have a Canon EOS Rebel T3i and bought it with the default lens that comes with it. We also bought another lens for basic zooming capability.  We lost one of the caps.  Came on here and decided to buy two of these caps.  It was great because these caps were exactly the same as the one we lost.  We still had one cap to compare with and it really cool to have a spare now.

0061537934|5.0|This book helped me through a very difficult time in my life. My 15 year old yellow lab was dying from cancer and a friend gave me this book to read. I was like what? This is a terrible book to give someone with a dying pet. But as I continued reading the book it lifted my spirit and by the end really eased my pain so much. Thank you Garth Stein for this book. I keep it on my nightstand and read passages from it all the time and tell all my friends to read it.
B0001XALT6|4.0|this is a great movie! and dvd was in terrific shape, i really thought this had an interesting story to it.
1594744769|5.0|I guess the cover's vintage photo image is what first drew me to this book.  There is a girl hovering about six inches above a trail in the woods.  Leafing through the book, one finds other vintage photographs scattered with the text.  As a sometimes collector of such old photos - oftentimes called \\"vernacular\\" photos, this further fascinated me.     The read has been an absolute pleasure.  The author writes from the first person viewpoint and brings us into the detailed observations and  thinking a \\"disturbed\\" teenager. But the story evolves into a mystery and then into something a whole lot more - almost sci-fi in nature.  Without giving the plot away about half way through the book, a major leap of faith is presented to the reader -  and I took it..  This leads the story in an entirely new and unexpected direction that reminds me in some ways of the Harry Potter series.     A suspense building and very satisfying read and the ending seems to open the door for a follow-up novel or two.      Overall I highly recommend this book - will keep you thinking for awhile.
B0031SCV46|5.0|This keyboard has so much good stuff going for it i don't even know where to start.<br /><br />The knobs and faders feel great and map to anything without much hassle at all, I've used them in Sonar, Reason, FLStudio, and Ableton inside of many many different VST synths, effects, and on every built in function that i could find, and every time they map easily, feel great and work extremely well!<br /><br />They keyboard is a little squishy feeling.  It's not the greatest I've ever felt but it still feels pretty good.  Its just about the perfect size for doing most of what many people will be doing with it.  It's also pressure sensitive, which is cool.  It doesn't have any type of aftertouch(as far as i know...)  but who needs it...<br /><br />This is a very good usb midi keyboard by a very good company, and I enjoy using it every day!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I cannot wait to see the movie in March 2012. The entire series is amazing
1451648537|4.0|This was an interesting book and a must read for anyone who is dealing with a family member with a personality disorder.  I am not a psychiatrist but borderline personality disorder due to a feeling of abandonment is written all over this characterization of Steve Jobs.  The \\"Reality Distortion\\" and the labeling of people as good or bad are two significant bpd characteristics.  Maybe another book by a good psychologist is in order.
B0015DROBO|1.0|This review is for the first book and about a third of the second book.  I can't get over how positive the reviews of this thing are.  I am a devour-er of books.  I don't read literary fiction, usually genre books, tons and tons of them.  The bad books I read, usually I read them and let it go, it usually doesn't bother me.  I can't do that with this series - I just couldn't let it go without a review.<br /><br />What the heck is everyone going on about how fast paced and well written the story is?  It's uneven, it's boring, and it's all little tiny descriptive details that I don't care about.  I don't care that Blomkvist has had 74863523762 sandwiches and 895474864273 cups of coffee.  Does the author have any imagination at all?  I had to SLOG my way through the book to even get to the mystery. And Lisbeth's super-high-techniness and her \\"super duper\\" computer just sounds out of date with all the in depth descriptions of in the book.  It did not survive time's savages well.  There was a little bit of momentum at the end of book one that I was hoping there was SOME promise.<br /><br />Then I started book 2....<br /><br />Can someone tell me why NO ONE IS UPSET THAT LISBETH SEDUCES A 16 YEAR OLD BOY WITHOUT SCRUPLES? In any other book review, I'd see people left and right ripping the author a new one on this alone.  This bothered me so much as I went through the first third of the book that I couldn't really focus on any of the other boring details that I don't care about - can we all say Lisbeth's trip to IKEA?<br /><br />I have all 3 books on my Kindle.  I bought all three together based on the uber-positive reviews from the press, from Amazon, from everywhere.<br /><br />I can't even finish book 2.  I don't know that I will even try.  Maybe if I completely run out of books to read.  But I started this series on such high hopes after reading all 4 Chelsea Cain books in 3 days that I am so disappointed, I don't even know where to go.  I started an Ian Rankin book last night.  Hopefully, that will rinse the bad taste from Stieg Larsson and his books from my mouth.taste from Stieg Larsson and his books from my mouth.

B004VYYA2K|4.0|I purchased 2 of these for my girls.  They have the traditional hard case Barbie storage containers that are overflowing so I was looking for more storage.  I like this item because it's not only storage but they can use it for play.  It's very vivid with lots of different patterns.  When zipped up it creates a nice sized box in which you can store Barbies and accessories.  They will get these for Christmas and I believe they will be well used and loved.  They are a little pricey but I think they are superior to the traditional hard storage cases.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|Never watched this series when it was on TV.  Bought it as a 86th birthday gift for my aunt.  (She had seen some of the TV episodes but missed quite a few.)  It was a surprise to me to find MYSELF highly entertained with the story-line.    Amazon delivered the complete collection in its usual timely fashion and ALL of the family is enjoying the entire series. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoys a refreshing aspect of the political scene.
0385535139|5.0|It was a while since I read a Grisham book because they were all the same and getting rather boring.  This one, though, I found to be a real page turner and enjoyed it from beginning to end!  A very good read and interesting take on downsizing in the corporate world.

0439023521|2.0|I read this book and liked the pace and action but the character development and easy descriptions started to get on my nerves.  It made me realize that I wasn't plagiarizing when I did a different twist on Lord of the Flies when I was younger.  I wasn't plagiarizing but I was being very UNORIGINAL.   Its all been done.  Its pretty predictable even for people who have not read Battle Royal.    I did like the pace and it was fun.  Its great for older teenagers and young adults I guess but it couldn't be more unoriginal.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Before spending a nickel on better headphones, buy the E6 - musical clarity and definition are astounding in comparison with stock iphone/ipod/zune. Don't bother if you own a sony walkman s or better, since their converter is subjectively better. Overall this is the best money spent on an audio upgrade.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|For 2 years I used a Palm Pre with a physical keyboard.  I finally made the jump to Android (Evo 3D) and was fearful that I would have issues typing on a virtual keyboard.  I tried out several keyboards and finally settled on SwiftKey X.  The way it predicts words is truly remarkable.  I can tap away at the keyboard at blazing speeds and everytime I press the spacebar it inserts its best guess for the word I was trying to type and in most cases it's correct.  It will even know the correct word you were trying to use when you spell it unintentionally as another correctly spelled word.  For example, I typed \\"very food\\" and it changed it to \\"very good\\".  Also it can optionally keep track of the way you type in emails, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc.  There are a lot of times when I type a certain phrase in an email and it remembers it automatically.  So if I type a word, it'll show the next word in the phrase.  If I tap it, the next word appears, and so on.  So there are times when I don't even have to type anything.  It seems to also work in other apps such as PowerAMP music player.  I was editing tags for an album in PowerAMP.  I edited the album name of one of the songs, then when I went to the next song it knew the next word in the album as soon as I started typing it.  I just picked up the Galaxy Tab 8.9 and I look forward to installing SwiftKey X Tablet edition on there.  I was lucky enough to pick up the phone version as the Amazon free app of the day, but I'll happily give them my money for the tablet version.  For anyone on the fence on whether to buy this phone version, jump off the fence and buy it.  It really makes typing on a virtual keyboard a breeze.
B004EPZ08E|1.0|UltraViolet digital copy is a terrible idea.  iTunes compatible digital copy is the only standard.  Don't support this garbage.  You can only use them through the apps they want you to use so it will not work with an Apple TV.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|I received the DVD very quickly, within a day or two of ordering! The price was very reasonable, however, the DVD did have one small section that was damaged and skipped when I played it. It wasn't enough to make me return it, but other than that I'd say service and quality are both good for the price paid.
B00005ONMJ|4.0|Despite its age (Salzburg Festival, 1954), this is a chance to see the great Cesare Siepi totally mastering this difficult role.  Superb of voice and lithe of movement, this is the Don that no woman could easily resist, even if she regrets it later! Siepi's interpretation is very different to that of Raimondi's rather demonic Don or (more recently) Terfel's thuggish Don.  His performance of the \\"champagne aria\\" has never, in my opinion, been bettered. He is well-matched by superlative singing from the rest of the cast - the two \\"Donnas\\", Grummer and Della Casa, are sublime. Erna Berger makes a rather mature Zerlina but is appropriately pert and cheeky. It was a surprise to see (and hear) Otto Edelmann as Leporello and as he clumps and grimaces his way around the stage you can see the makings of the fine Baron Ochs that he is soon to play in Rosenkavalier.  This isn't a criticism - he is a very fine Leporello too.  Anton Dermota (of whom I'd never heard before)is quite a virile Don Ottavio in this unrewarding role. I'm no expert on conducting but Furtwangler has a nice old-school approach and the orchestra is as good as you'd expect the Vienna Phil to be, even in those austere post-war years.  True, the colours seem a bit faded (though I felt this gave the production an appealing ambience - the Don as metaphor for the crumbling, stumbling shambles that once-powerful and glorious Spain was soon to become).  The sound track, too, is a bit rough here and there, but never in my opinion affects one's enjoyment of a production that must be regarded as a classic.  I'm so pleased to have it in my opera collection!
1461190460|1.0|Couldn't believe my eyes when this arrived. One of the worst quality books I've ever seen. As you can see in the \\"click to look inside,\\" which I regrettably did not do before purchasing, the front and back covers are gigantic blow-ups of low-quality JPEGs. There is no copyright page. The ink is cheap; the whole thing looks, smells and feels cheap. It's an unprofessional rendering of a book that looks like a cheap Chinese knock-off.  There is no information in the book itself on who could have produced this obscenity. That's no surprise; I'd be embarrassed to have published this, too. I will be returning it forthwith. I'm incredulous that this seems to be the only paperback version of The Little Prince on Amazon. It's godawful. Saint-Exupéry would be turning in his grave if he knew of this abomination.
0446573019|1.0|Every time I go back to the well of Baldacci for a cool drink of water, I remain thirsty after the drink. Another one of his books that are just full of mean and unlikeable characters. There is no one to root for. I really wonder how he sleeps at night? I guess well, for he continues to laugh all the way to the bank. I keep allowing him to steal my time, which is precious, shame on me. In this day and age I feel he is the Kardashian of publishing. Shame on me for being taken/fooled by him, ONCE AGAIN.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|My wife and I love this movie.  We first watched it with our nieces and nephew but we thought it was fun enough to watch alone as adults as well.  We normally don't rewatch many movies, so for us to actually buy a movie (and not just rent) shows how much we enjoy it.
B003Z0BSU8|3.0|This release has received, as far as I have seen, almost universal praise. I am indeed able to recognize many of the qualities praised by various reviewers, but overall I must admit that I was disappointed, especially since I generally count myself as an admirer of Andsnes's piano playing. His accounts of the Grieg and Schumann concertos remain, for example, among the best ever made (all the way up there with Lupu's). But for that one he was paired with Mariss Jansons; for these Rachmaninov concertos the conductor is Antonio Pappano, and perhaps some of the problem may be that I have never really, shall I say, \\"cracked the Pappano-code\\" - underlined by the fact that Andsnes's recording with Berglund remains among the top choices.<br /><br />Andsnes's piano playing is indeed dazzling; furious and ferocious, yet with plenty of magnificent details, glittering nuances and magnificent phrases; in that respect I guess it is possible to enjoy this recording by relishing those marvelous details alone. He is also very well balanced with the orchestra, at least for the most part, and jointly they certainly provide a forward-leaning, quite intense and even bloodlusting reading with quite a forward momentum. My complaint, however, is that - at least in my opinion - many of the themes and parts are oddly accentuated and emphasized, and though Andsnes and Pappano generate plenty of intensity they miss much of the riveting power of many of the most important details, they blur important transitions in mood, and choosing such an overall intense approach entails (at least in this case) that many of Rachmaninov's most harrowing statements lose their individual impact - there is a lack of dynamic and emotional range here to really get the shifts and ambiguities between tragedy, redemption, fire, wistfulness and radiance that e.g. Ashkenazy manages to realize so breathtakingly.<br /><br />In the third concerto's first movement this performance does indeed build up tremendous power, but at the cost of missing the nuances in atmosphere. The slow movement - the best one - avoids sentimentality but is still touching. The third movement, one of the greatest creations in the piano concerto literature, is the main problem, however. The opening, for instance, is one of Rachmaninov's most magnificent creations but in this version I miss the sense of urgency in the otherworldly soaring lines set against the powerful tutti moments - they make no impact, no sense of heaven-storming anger and - more importantly - little sense of contrast and coloristic range. The ending of the movement lacks magic as well, even if it is indeed powerful due to Andsnes's and Pappano's ability to realize the movement as a single unified arch - it is just that the costs of that approach is, for me, too great.<br /><br />In the fourth concerto the opening is dramatic, but completely misses the ambiguity of those opening fanfares (joyful majesty turned to tragedy in the blink of an eye). Elsewhere there is plenty of sweetness and romance, and Andsnes's icy leaps and trills never fail to impress. But again, the approach is stuck at one single mood throughout the work, and while it again achieves real power it just misses too many important points - it is all cast in shades of red rather than using the full range of colors. Rachmaninov's scores are so much richer than what comes across in these performances. The sound quality is exemplary, however, and given the number of people who disagree with me I suppose no one should take my opinion as any kind of conclusive verdict. Still, I am really not willing to recommend this as long as, say, Ashkenazy's versions or Byron Janis (or for that matter Andsnes's previous recording) are options.ing the nuances in atmosphere.

1600597963|5.0|I would like to stress to anyone starting to bead that this book is a must have!<br /><br />To emphasize this concept I believe I could grab 20 random people and give them each this book, access to a large shop with similar items as are used within the book, all the hours in a long weekend and the results would be stunning at the least.<br /><br />Rarely do you find a teacher of this caliber, and I am excited for all that this one is in this field. Most of the time the work of the artist has to be enough to satisfy the curiosity of the masses, but with this one we get that excitement plus the added bonus of the elaborate and detailed teachings in an comprehensive encyclopedic form that both inspires as well as improves everyone's skills that crack it's cover, and I do mean everyone.<br /><br />I read books, no actually I devour books and I am very well acquainted with all sorts of bead/artistic bead/artistic formats and really appreciate the rare teaching format that actually teaches and positively dance if it inspires as well...<br /><br />This book makes one dance. I wish they gave an extra special symbol for the rare books that deserve them.
B0067BEB10|5.0|I have to stand out on a limb and say that this is probably the best musically produced album without the musical genius himself. The album, \\"Michael\\", may have been wonderful had the production been so much more better. The music production for \\"Immortal\\" feels like time was taken to polish and recreate new things that Michael, I believe, would have gave the thumbs up for. By far, if any following unreleased music becomes released and produced with just as much care and creativity, this is the best music tribute related to the King of Pop.  Thumbs up for \\"Immortal\\" for the energy!

B005HSG3TC|1.0|If you're looking for a light weight thin case for your Kindle Fire, this case will probably do a minimal job. If you're looking for a case that willprotect your Kindle Fire and as a stand, there are a number of cases/stands that do a much better job. This case has a groov on the back that the front cover is supposed to fit into when using it as a stand. The problem is that it slips out of the groove with minimal contact and the unit falls flat. I wouldn't reccommend purchasing this case/stand! After using it as described for a week, I finally gave up and returned it fora refund to Amazon. There are much better and cheaper cases/stands available,which I ordered.

B005NF2UE6|5.0|Once again Nickelback has put together an album that reminds us that Rock and Roll still lives.  You see, it's fairly simple, for all of their haters, Nickelback just continues to churn out hit records and play to sold out arenas around the globe. Here and Now will have the same fate. After their last 2 enormously successful records All the Right Reasons and Dark Horse, I as a huge fan, was a bit nervous that they would be able to duplicate their success, well after listening to the album, I can tell you the boys from Hanna Alberta don't dissapoint.  There are your songs you'll hear on the radio (When We Stand Together, Lullaby, Holding on to Heaven) songs you'll hear at sporting events (Bottoms Up, This Means War, Kiss it Goodbye) and the of course the sex and drinking filled tracks Nickelback fans love (Midnight Queen, Gotta Get me Some).   I will say that Lullaby is probably the most beautiful and well done song this band has ever done. I expect it will be a huge hit for the band and a track that will define this album for years to come.  Enjoy the album folks!

These 2 CD's are chock-full of old classics and new s.h.i.t. destined to become classics.  Slash is a Guitar God, and this cd is living proof.  Yeah, the DVD is a letdown since it only contains about a third of the show, but I don't care.  I'd rather jam out in the car then on the couch.  Great live album..,like I said, they don't make these anymore.
B0036T32LQ|5.0|The movie kept my interest. It did not provide an ending that would settle the problem presented in the movie. This might make people unsatisfied with the movie. This is the same way that movies with a happy ending leave the viewer with satisfaction and contempt, while movies with a sad ending leave us with a bitter taste but are unforgettable. Movies with happy endings come and go, we forget them. Well, this movie has neither. It is a never ending loop, but still it was interesting to watch so give it a shot. Be patient with it.
B0027HOBM2|5.0|I love this series and have kept up with it since Season 2 however I did not realize the level of picture quality and detail that I was missing out on with my 1080I cable service.  While I normally do not spend the extra money on Blu-Ray and only have a player because I own a PS3 this show is different.  It is worth a couple extra bucks to appreciate the wonderful cinematography of this modern classic.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This is a pleasant read by a very funny woman. Some have complained that it isn't self-revealing enough, but I don't read (or watch) Tina Fey to get another \\"deep\\" and heavy memoir. At least not when she has just turned 40 -- maybe later. It seems the biggest cause of angst in her life thus far was whether to have a second child, something which has since been resolved.<br /><br />It's the early jobs and introduction to improv (and her insight into what makes it work) that make this book a pleasure to read. That and all the throwaway lines. She spends a good bit of time talking about her impersonation of Sarah Palin, and some of the awkwardnesses involved when Palin requested to appear on SNL. Interesting background and insight into TV.<br /><br />A good read.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|\\"Moneyball\\" is based on true events, and provides valuable insight regarding the on-field and off-field dynamics of the Oakland A's Major League Baseball Club.  This film has the capacity to engage viewers who are familiar or unfamiliar with the sport, based on the avant-garde approach to managing resources that is utilised by Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), which any person in business can appreciate.  The narrative is also inspiring, as the viewer is presented with what seems like impossible circumstances for the A's to be successful, yet through innovative thinking high performance is achieved.  Brad Pitt provides a solid performance, as does the entire cast, and the viewer is entertained with plenty of humour and quality drama.  This movie is a win for baseball, as it has the capacity to introduce new people to the game from all over the world.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Baseball Author

B002VECM72|5.0|I have seen this movie about a half dozen times on Cable and decided it was time to buy my own copy on Blu-Ray.  \\"The Blind Side: is one of those great movies that I love to keep as part of my collection to watch over and over again.  The movie is inspirational and leaves you feeling good.  One of those films that makes you believe that there is a better side to the human condition versus all the crud we run across that leads us to paranoia and mistrust.<br /><br />Michael Oher (a crack baby) is taken in by the Tuohy's as a foster child and eventually adopted.  He becomes a football phenom and this story is his journey from nothing to everything.  It is a story about family and  trust.  I love the cast, the way the film moves and how it ends.  It's a feel-good film.<br /><br />A must see!
1451648537|5.0|If Jobs didn't like something he wouldn't hesitate to tell you how it sucked.  If he lived to read this book I feel confident in saying he would have said the same thing about this book...then he would have changed his mind and loved it...then he would have hated it again.  Then he would have loved it in the end and appreciated it.  Such is the life of a man who will go down in history with the likes of Ford and Edison as the author pointed out.  Full of contradictions and mood swings yet had the vision that revolutionized the computer industry.  The story of his life was well written by Isaacson.  I didn't like Jobs at all in the beginning and even though he was still an a-hole his 2nd time around at Apple he had turned into one of the greatest businessmen of our era and my dislike turned into respect.  I respected things he did even if I didn't agree with them such as the control he wanted with his systems.  If you like computers, have an interest in Jobs then you will like the novel as the author doesn't drag anything out which was my worry when I picked it up being over 600 pages.  It was the right length and was fair.  There was no love affair between the author and Jobs, he put his life out there and is letting you be the judge.  I could never embrace the Apple system as I like the freedom my PC gives me but I do understand why Jobs wanted the control over the product...other than his personality.  Highly recommend.
B005JZ18IY|5.0|I stumbled upon Ed Sheeran when they played The A Team on radio, and I've been hooked since. There's a rhythm in his music, candidness in his lyrics and a depth in his voice which are rare in today's music. If you like Jason Mraz or Howie Day (more the former), you'll likely enjoy Ed Sheeran's music. For a debut album, + is simply awesome. I enjoyed almost all the tracks and even the ones which didn't quite appeal to me, I still found pretty decent. Overall, I'd say that Ed Sheeran's the real deal. Unlike other new artists (of which there are many), I believe Ed, like his music, is here to stay! I can't wait for what else this talented artist has to offer!

B005LL4U54|4.0|Each year, around this time, an unexpected art house film emerges as a critical darling with Academy Awards potential. It happened to Life is Beautiful in 1998, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in 2000, Brokeback Mountain in 2005, Juno in 2007, Slumdog Millionaire in 2008, Precious in 2009... the list goes on and on. In 2011, that film could be The Artist, director Michel Hazanavicius's story about a silent movie matinee idol in 1920s Hollywood whose career is threatened by the advent of sound in motion pictures. The difference here, unlike those other films, is that The Artist is a silent film itself, shot in black and white and in such a way that the style and tone of the piece mirrors the very films in which Hazanavicius's protagonist appears. The movie stars Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, John Goodman, James Cromwell, Missi Pyle and Penelope Ann Miller, and has already opened to great critical acclaim in the United States.  Back in the early part of the 20th century, films were often accompanied by a live pianist performing `photoplay music', or by an orchestra performing classical music of the day, to accentuate the mood of the film. Occasionally directors would hire composers to write original music that would be played during the film's performance - the first recorded instance of this was in 1908 when the revered classical composer Camille Saint-Saëns wrote 15 minutes of original music for the historical drama L'Assassinat du duc de Guise, and later Joseph Carl Breil's wrote a significant score for D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation in 1915 - but the first feature-length film with synchronized sound effects and a pre-recorded musical soundtrack was the 1926 film Don Juan, which had a score by William Axt and David Mendoza, and came out a year before Al Jolson changed the world with The Jazz Singer. It is against this backdrop, and with these early stylistics in mind, that French composer Ludovic Bource approached The Artist.  Ludovic Bource scored the director's previous three features - Mes Amis in 1999, OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies in 2006 and OSS 117: Lost in Rio in 2009 - as well as a handful of short films and a 2009 documentary called Nous Resterons Sur Terre, but other than that is a virtual unknown, both inside France and internationally. This could all change with The Artist. Being a silent film, with all that implies (no audible dialogue, no sound effects), the music for The Artist takes on a whole new dimension, having to convey every emotion, every nuance, and every direction of the story without overwhelming the film. In his research prior to writing the music, Bource looked at the scores from Charlie Chaplin's films, as well as early works by composers such as Max Steiner, Franz Waxman and Bernard Herrmann, trying to re-create that classic sound in 2011. Remember, no-one has really scored films like this since 1936, when Charlie Chaplin released Modern Times, the last significant conventional \\"silent film\\" made before talkies became the dominant entertainment media.  On the whole, Bource has succeeded admirably, recapturing the sound of the earliest part of the Golden Age, while simultaneously crafting a score which is thematically appealing and enjoyable to modern audiences - no mean feat. Having said that, listeners unused to hearing the unashamedly romantic stylings that flourished during that period, or who are not accustomed to a total and utter lack of subtlety in their film music, are likely to be confused or, worse still, totally turned off by The Artist's intentionally old-fashioned sound.  Parts of The Artist have a Franz Waxman sound from his Bride of Frankenstein years; elsewhere, it could be Alfred Newman, Cole Porter, Gershwin, Charlie Chaplin, Carl Stalling, or an early Disney underscore by composers like Leigh Harline or Frank Churchill. At other times, Bource seems to be intentionally channeling the big romantic symphonic repertoire of the 19th century via composers such as Prokofiev, Debussy, Ravel and Brahms, all to generally excellent effect. Be aware that I'm not saying that Bource is being unoriginal with these references; it's all done to illustrate the musical conventions of a specific time and a specific place, and Bource does it with all the flair and panache of a true homage.  The theme for the main character, \\"George Valentin\\", is an infectiously upbeat string-based strut, with a prominent xylophone part and a virtuoso piano line, capturing the easy breezy life of a man about town in the golden age of silent cinema. The theme and it's orchestrations are carried over into the charming romantic piece for \\"Pretty Peppy\\", George's romantic interest, and into later cues such as the lovely and lush \\"Fantasie d'Amour\\", and the quirky \\"Jungle Bar\\".  Everything about the score is larger than life; the classic Hollywood flourishes of the opening \\"Artist Ouverture\\"; the adventurous brass phrasing and mickey-mouse Korngold-inspired action music of \\"1927: A Russian Affair\\" or \\"Silent Rumble\\", the beautiful romantic piano solo in \\"Comme Une Rosée de Larmes\\", and the stark and dissonant \\"L'Ombre des Flammes\\", which has a wonderfully chaotic and occasionally unexpectedly brutal action music conclusion that could have come straight from Steiner's King Kong. \\"In the Stairs\\" has a hesitant, almost childlike idyll, with a pretty piano line and blushing, swooning strings accompanied by delicate woodwinds, chimes and harp glissandi, capturing perfectly the burgeoning relationship between the two leads. Conversely, the more tragedy-laden \\"The Sound of Years\\" has a sense of both despondent yearning in its lower-register string writing and sweeping, grand guignol heartbreak when the violins pick up the lead of the piece during it's second half.  The score concludes in outstanding fashion, beginning with the charming and sweeping \\"Happy Ending\\", which as one might imagine is filled with lush romantic strings and flighty flute impressions. The violence of the shadow of flames from earlier in the score reappears in the rather shocking penultimate cue, \\"Ghosts from the Past\\", before everything comes to a solemn, tragic end in \\"My Suicide\\", a moving string lament which restates the Sound of Tears theme and finishes the score proper on a largely downbeat, but appropriate note of large-scale pathos.  The conclusive jazz piece, \\"Peppy and George\\", re-arranges and re-orchestrates George's buoyant theme for the big band sound of Benny Goodman, complete with a faithful homage to the classic Gene Krupa big drum sound. A couple of source cues and songs, ranging from a performance of Alberto Ginastera's ballet Estancia (which is slightly anachronistic as it was written in 1941), Duke Ellington's \\"Jubilee Stomp\\" and songs by Jay Livingston and Johnny Burke, round out the album, adding to the 1920s feel.  If The Artist continues to wow critics in independent theaters across America, and if I know the way the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences thinks - and I'm usually pretty good as predicting these things - then this score will likely take home the Oscar for Best Original Score next spring. I'm not saying this is the best score of the year - there are several which rank above it on my own personal list - but this is exactly the kind of thing the Academy likes to honor. Foreign composer, arty film, not likely to pick up many other awards in other categories... it ticks all the right boxes, for sure. It also helps that the score is genuinely very good in and of itself, despite - or perhaps because of - its authentic period sound and sensibility, which is likely to alienate younger listeners more attuned to Remote Control power anthems, but will utterly delight others.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|At the start, Bullitt appears to be a straightforward cop drama. Walter Chalmers, a high-ranking official with fearsome clout, has hand-picked Lieutenant Frank Bullitt to head a special detail for round-the-clock protection of a star witness in an upcoming senate hearing.<br /><br />It's a staple of the genre that hardworking cops are hamstrung by a meddlesome mayor, a citizens committee, a brainless chief, or buffoons with the Feds. In Bullitt, the position of Chalmers (senator?, US Attorney?) is  never specified. All we know is there will be hell to pay if he isn't obeyed without question. Fawning aides are a mere finger-snap away.<br /><br />Chalmers has personally selected the hideout for his witness, \\"Johnny Ross.\\" It's cheap waterfront hotel, the Daniels ($1.75 a night).  Bullitt is clearly concerned about a possible hit. He doesn't like the location, but he's a good cop who doesn't question orders. Telling \\"Ross\\" to stay away from the windows is just a routine precaution.<br /><br />Naturally, there's a hit on \\"Ross.\\" One of Bullitt's team, a young family man, is severely injured. Before he gets blasted with the hitman's Winchester pump, \\"Ross\\" blurts his last words: \\"He TOLD me--!\\" Chalmers? What did he say to \\"Ross\\"? Maybe Chalmers really wants \\"Ross\\" (and Bullitt) dead.<br /><br />At the hospital, Bullitt morphs into the shrewd and cunning maverick he was supposed to be from the getgo. The Bullitt we know and love would not have trusted Chalmers for a second. He would have spirited \\"Ross\\" to a secure location known only to his team.<br /><br />Pulse-quickening chases and mesmerizing visuals have garnered the movie a small but devoted following. The film's admirers are left wondering what might have been had Bullitt followed a more realistic story arc instead of getting sidetracked in a sappy romance featuring the lovely Jacqueline Bisset (the era's Angelina Jolie).<br /><br />We have only Steve McQueen to blame. At this point in his career he had extensive creative control (not always a good thing). McQueen saw himself as an important actor, a film artist, and a leading man in the old Hollywood mold.<br /><br />The script was reworked to the point that no one was sure what kind of movie they were making: a complex character study with a little action thrown in, or an action movie laced with a smidgen of character development. It could be that McQueen simply had the hots for Bisset and had her written in. Reportedly there was a steamy off-screen dalliance during shooting.<br /><br />The romance is a tedious rendition of the mismatched couple trope. When Bullitt stops by the architectural firm where Cathy works, he is as out-of-place as he is at the Pacific Heights mansion of Walter Chalmers. At the mansion, Clamers makes a lame attempt to buddy up to Bullitt. \\"Now that you know where my house it, I hope we'll get to see more of each other.\\" It's the Pacific Heights equivalent of \\"Let's do lunch!\\" Bullitt's glum expression shows he doesn't appreciate being patronized.<br /><br />By visiting a hoity-toity establishment like Coffee Cantata (now defunct), Bullitt dutifully tries to cultivate a taste for Cathy's refined preferences. Cathy, meanwhile, finds Bullitt a refreshing antidote to her artsy-fartsy milieu. Bullitt is a REAL MAN who can fulfill her sophisticated needs. Cathy wants Bullitt to open up about his mysterious life. \\"It's not for you,\\" he tells her. Whereupon he treats her to a good lay to keep her focused the true basis of their affair.<br /><br />Following the grisly Thunderbolt Motel incident, when she finally glimpses his everyday world, Cathy recoils in horror.  \\" . . . Nothing touches you. . .you're living in a sewer . . how can you be part of it?\\" For a grown woman she's comically naive. Maybe Bullitt is right when he tells Cathy \\"Time starts now\\" but the embarrassing scene makes the movie stop now.<br /><br />McQueen fought to have Bullitt shot entirely on location, a rarity in 1968. It's a splendiddocument of San Francisco of the era. The seedy Daniels Hotel is perched on a curve of the Embarcadero Freeway (since demolished). A car could swerve through the window any moment. In the background we see the old Union 76 clock tower (since demolished). Bullitt meets an informant at the now-defunct Enrico's, for decades a North Beach institution. We're treated to delightful shots of Union Square, the Mark Hopkins, Pacific Heights, Grace Cathedral, California Street cable cars, and the Marina with the fog-shrouded Golden Gate in the background. The vintage Safeway store (still standing) also appears in Dirty Harry.<br /><br />We get a nostalgic look at everyday features that have since disappeared: primitive ambulances, phone booths, old-fashioned wailing sirens, and a Telecopier (kachunkachunkachunk), a fax progenitor that transmitted a page in about five minutes. We're reminded of vintage lingo like \\"How's that grab ya?\\" It's priceless the way sleep-deprived Bullitt digs for the last crystals from a jar of instant coffee, then heats the wretched brew with a plug-in coil. The hospital and airport sequences, with their documentary realism, are endlessly fascinating.<br /><br />Idiosyncratic touches keep things interesting. The Mark Hopkins doorman wears an outlandish Cossack hat. At the hospital Chalmers talks briefly with Westcott, a goofy-looking reporter who walks around with an unlit pipe clamped in his jaw like Jacques Tati. With a smirk, Bullitt swipes a newspaper from a vending machine. The camera dwells puzzlingly on the cabbie's dog bobble head. Hush Puppies, the shoe company, used such a bobble head to promote the brand. It could have been a pioneering product placement ploy since Bullitt appears to wear Hush Puppies chukka boots.<br /><br />You gotta love Mike & Phil, the stonefaced gunmen. Just another day of chasin' and killin'. As the chase unfolds, the Mustang and Charger sniff each other like growling attack dogs. At Army Street and Precita Avenue, Bullitt makes a u-turn in front of a classic Phillips 66 batwing filling station (now demolished). Fat horns from Schifrin's score set the mood. The Mustang makes a quick right on York and zooms up the hill. The chase is on. The sequence has to bring a tingle to the back of your neck.<br /><br />It's 1968, a year everyone who was alive then would like to forget. American society is coming apart at the seams. In March, President Lyndon Johnson bows out of the presidential race over his Vietnam misadventure. Civil rights protesters are gunned down in the streets. That summer, an ugly melee between police and protesters surrounds the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. After wining medals at the Olympic Games in Mexico City, two African American athletes mount the podium and raise their fists in a Black Power salute. The police are popularly referred to as \\"pigs.\\" African Americans were commonly known as \\"Negroes.\\" Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King are assassinated. Andy Warhol gets shot.<br /><br />The Feminine Mystique, the book that launched feminism (aka Women's Liberation), was published in 1963. In those days a professional woman like Cathy was a feminist trailblazer.<br /><br />None of this subtext is referred to in Bullitt. It could just as easily have been set in 1958, except Cathy would have been a receptionist not a technician and Dr. Willard would have been white.<br /><br />With just a knowing glance, Bullitt and Dr. Willard have a meeting of the minds. Bullitt is obviously cool with the brothers. Chalmers is another story.  He insists that Dr. Willard is too young and inexperienced to properly care for his wounded star witness.<br /><br />Chalmers's racism may be too subtle for younger viewers to perceive. In 1968, a black doctor--an emergency room surgeon no less--was unthinkable, an insult to everything good Americans held near and dear. Movies and TV shows with black characters doing anything important were a novelty. In 1965, Bill Cosby became the first African-American to co-star in a dramatic series. (The disgraced and discredited Amos 'n' Andy, one of the most popular comedy shows of the '50s, with its all-black cast, has been edited out of TV history.) In August of '67, the movie In the Heat of the Night was released. In a sensational scene, Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) an African-American police detective, slaps (!) a Southern plantation owner.  The movie Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (also starring Poitier) with its scandalous depiction of an interracial couple, was released the same year.<br /><br />When Bullitt shoots Ross dead at the airport, the movie closes with defining images. Bullitt uses his sport jacket to shroud the body of Ross. Chalmers climbs into his limo and reads the Wall Street Journal, house organ for the ruling class. Back to business as usual. The limo sports a bumper sticker: Support Your Local Police, mocking the slogan. A priest kneels over the corpse of the airport cop Ross gunned down.  Back at his apartment Bullitt peeks in on a sleeping Cathy. In the bathroom, he gazes at himself in the mirror with a look of sober self-appraisal. The camera lingers on his pistol and ammo resting on the balustrade. We hear Bullitt splashing noisily in the wash basin, a ritual cleansing of the horrors he's just been through.Bullitt makes a u-turn in front of a classic Phillips 66 batwing filling station (now demolished).

B0043URV5U|5.0|Both of Seger's Greatest Hits packages were amazing, even though I own so much of his music already but this collection is definitely worth while.  Why?  The live versions of Beautiful Loser and Travelin' Man as well as the last four tracks on CD 2 make their case.  What's missing?  Well, I wish there was a track or two from The Fire Inside and It's a Mystery....I happen to like \\"The Fire Inside\\" and \\"Miami\\".  Nonetheless, Seger is pure here.  What about \\"Even Now\\" from The Distance and \\"American Storm\\" from Like A Rock.
B005M2V2K8|4.0|What was not to love about this little white cat with pink ears and eyes? My 7 year old is collecting these and this was one of the ones she just \\"HAD\\" to have and none could be found in any of the stores around us that sold them. It arrived promptly and in new condition.
B005KQVDH8|3.0|I've always loved the Goonies movie, and I'll save the review of the movies to the countless others that have done so before me. instead, I prefer to focus on the transfer itself. The video \\"was good enough for me\\" (rim-shot), but the audio was poor to say the least. It was flat and lacked depth. Very disappointing. If your watching it through a TVs speakers, you might not even notice, but those with high-end Home Theatre systems will come away wanting more from the audio mix.
0062060554|5.0|I just finished this book, and I must say it was amazing. It really kept me on edge until the last few pages, and I loved the major twist ending. Allthough, I did have some inkling of what was going to happen about 2/3s of the way through, I did not expect it to be so dramatic. I highly recommened this book!! Also, as a side note, I read this on my Kindle, and it was very good. I dont recall any misspelled words, or random sentences, or misplaced punctuation.
B002XUBDZ6|5.0|Like most reviews, I'll not write about the movie itself, preferring instead to focus on the picture and sound transfer. In short, the video is nearly flawless. Very nice video transfer. The audio is amazing. A very rich, and dynamic DTS transfer, those with superior Home Theatre systems will be most pleased with the audio mix.

0316098329|4.0|My interest in Emma Donaghue's novel 'Room' originally developed when a hardcover copy sitting on the shelf of Barnes & Noble caught my eye.  What attracted me to it was the styling and simplicity of the novel's cover.  After briefly reading the synopsis printed on the jacket flaps of the book, my initial impression was, \\"Hmmmm\\".  Well, by time the paperback was released, with excerpts of positive reviews printed on both the front and back cover, I picked up a copy, read the first three sentences and was instantly hooked.  Bought it, couldn't put it down, read at quite a brisk pace and absolutely loved it.  I'd never heard of Emma Donaghue before 'Room' and honestly I have not read any of her other writings as of yet, but I was very intrigued with the way in which she presented this story - in the first-person perspective belonging to a five-year-old boy, Jack.    This is a deep novel.  Although it is ficiton, as we all know, a talented writer is able to craft aspects of reality and real-world human intellectuality into his or her writing.  Donaghue accomplishes this in such a unique way, by examining the world(s) through the eyes and mind of an innocent child who is both intelligent and observant, yet ignorant and simplistic, about the goings-on around he and his \\"Ma\\".  And all the while, Jack is curious, raising thought-provoking questions in his dialogue and thinking.  I am not trying to summarize the novel here; I'm only attempting to present my analysis of the main antagonist, Jack.  I was taken aback by Donaghue's use and necessary distortion of the English language throughout the novel.  I consider myself fairly well-read and there has been only one other instance throughout my 22 years of life during which I have encountered a work of literature whose author was so effortlessly able to tap into the mentality of a young person and provide an examination of human nature from the main character's POV.  That movel is 'The Catcher in the Rye'.  This brings me tomy reasoning for awarding 'Room' with 4.5 stars.  Myself, being an avid fan of 'Catcher' took special notice of a particular passage toward the end of 'Room' which reminded me a lot of something Holden Caulfield might think - so much so that it stuck out like a sore thumb to me against Donaghue's otherwise consistent writing style throughout the rest of the novel.  It felt a bit too forced, unfortunately.  But perhaps that's only due to the fact that I know and understand 'Catcher' quite well.  Anyway, buy 'Room'.  Hardcover, paperback, Kindle, whatever...This is a stunning achievement of a novel.  It deserves every accalade it has recieved in the literary world and then some.  Just as when I first read 'The Catcher in the Rye', I feel as though 'Room' entered my life for a reason (or, did I enter Room for a reason?).  It is a read that entertains while encouraging its reader to change his or her way of thinking.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|GREAT!!!!!!! I've never once had a single problem with it. Defiantly worth the investment. This is truly Michael Jackson's GREATEST PERFORMANCE EVER!!!
B005J4TLN4|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. It was a a bit different from other Sci-Fi films. I was a little surprised at the fact that the teens weren't spared from danger and death. And not in a typical slasher film format. They truly \\"fought\\" for their lives and the lives of their friends. It was a character driven story line. The unknown (to most Americans) actors were excellent and very believable as not so nice kids from neighborhood. My friends and I were waiting since last year to see this in the theaters and were very disappointed that in was a limited distribution in the U.S.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This a simple and pleasant way to while away the hours, and occasionally enjoy a win over &quot;Old Sol.&quot;  Highly recommended.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I am a sucker for these type of films. Great revenge flick. Very creative. Bad decisions though on the part of the heroine in the beginning but it wouldn't have been a story if she made better decisions. Didn't like the sexual aspect of the film but it was an integral part of the set up. Great characters for this type of film.
B005SV9X22|2.0|I went to this concert because all the hype around her, the concert estarts very promising, specially with all her fans screaming like little gils hitting puberty, anyway, she starst the show and while she's NO dancer, she makes the best out of her dance numbers, she plays the piano and she can sing, that's undenianble, but my complaint is that she talks, and talks, and talks, and talks, and talks, for a moment I thought I was in mass, listening to a sermon from the priest, she talks about the misunderstood (like her) the miscasts (like her) the \\"poor girl bullied in school\\" and how, in her concert all the freaks are free and they can be whatever they can be or want to be....  waht kind of message is that ? is she a proffesional victim now ???  this concert lacks energy, positive energy and her speeches are far too pointless and boring.  if you like her music, the best thing you can do is buy her singles, because she can barely dance and you wont be interrupted by her annoying screams, or yelling of the name of the city where she is performing every 10 minutes....
B005PTQPU0|1.0|I have loved Kate Bush for more than 25 years. I own all her albums and love them all except \\"Red Shoes\\". This new album \\"50 Words for Snow\\" is really an empty feeling recording. I understand she is an artist and is probably always trying to grow and experiment. This experiment should have stayed in the studio and not be for sale. With all the time, money, experience and talent she has, this is all she comes up with, it's sad. There is no way she listened to this and really liked it. It had to be about making money. Her last album \\"Ariel\\" , had a few good songs on it but was also disappointing. Her older stuff was so good ! This newer stuff isn't even close to the old. Maybe she should just retire and call it a good career.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Perhaps the app was upgraded at some point, but I have no idea why anyone had difficulty with loading the weather data for a location. It isn't entirely intuitive, granted, but if you simply tap the location you've just entered, it loads just as it should. I'd give it 5 stars, but this is the first app I've come across where the ad bar is actually distracting &amp; in the way.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|When I see people calling this movie \\"great\\" or any other word that's just talking it up so much, I want to smack the person that's saying it. The first movie in this franchise is a really good summer sci-fi/action movie. However, the second one in the series decided to focus more on having no plot at all, showing girls run in slow motion, horribly placed and distasteful humor, and having entirely too much of the human characters in the series.  Well, if you were a fan of the series hoping to see the wrongs of the second movie righted, you might as well not even watch this. This movie is two hours and 45 minutes long with nothing worthy of note until well into the third act. Half of the dialogue in this movie is made up of characters saying how hot Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is. Good thing, too, because she turns in a horrible acting performance, but don't worry... she's nowhere near alone. Ken Jeong, John Malkovich, and Patrick Dempsey give some of the worst performances that I have ever seen. This is hands down one of the worst experiences I've ever had watching a movie... I don't know if I've ever checked the time so much while watching one. I completely understand the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" involved with a sci-fi movie, but Michael Bay asks the audience to suspend their intelligence at many points in time during the film. If you like twenty minutes of mindless violence with two hours and twenty minutes of horrible plotline and absolutely no substance, then this is totally your movie. If you're over the age of eleven, avoid it.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Fianlly, a full length album of Christmas melodies from Mr. Buble, and what an album it is. Superb melodies by an artists of style with excellent arrangements from David Foster. Lush orchetrations for the quieter moments, eg 'It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas' and real swing/jive for the cool numbers eg, 'Jingle Bells' performed with The Puppini Sisters' reminiscent to The Andrews Sisters, one word excellent.<br />It is good to hear a Christmas album with the pure nostalgic moments written all over it and so refreshing to hear them. One of the better Christmas albums recently.<br />Can't help but get all so sentimental and Christmassy. Love it!

B003Y5H574|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie because it made me laugh and the chemistry between the characters were believable. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are so cute, sexy and funny together. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because of the inappropriate nude pics the babysitter took of herself. Totally did not need to be a part of the movie.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Shipment came on time and DVDs are in excellent shape. Season 4 begins another crazy year with new girl friend character, Amy, for Sheldon. Also picks up will Leonard with his new girl friend of Raj's sister which created a lot of tension with old girl friend of Penny. Funny as always in the nerdy sense of things.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This newest King novel did not disappoint.  I was drawn in from page one and could not sleep well until I finished the book.  I liked Under The Dome but REALLY loved this one.  I think this is one of the best King books that I have ever read.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|I, like many others, had been waiting for the whole collection to be released.  The fact that there are not many special features does not bother me.  What does bother me is the simple fact that Warner Brothers rushed this out too soon.  The images on the discs are pulled right from the old ones (The Half Blood Prince has disc 1 on it, when there is only one disc).  The Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a plain black disc with no image.  It took me forever to get the Deathly Hallows Part 1 to play because it kept bringing me back to my blu ray player's home screen.  I will be calling Amazon customer service and probably returning this.
B000ID37KO|5.0|A classic. Need I say more? Didn't think so. This movie had it all. And I love that it doesn't have a soundtrack. The sound of the birds does better than any music could do.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|Daughtry have done it again, there's not a single bad track on this album, almost no rockers except \\"Renegade\\" but that's not a bad thing, Chris Daughtry's voice and writing skills have matured a lot, a song that really shows that is \\"Gone too soon\\" which talks about a miscarriage, one of the most emotional songs i've heard in a while.  Overall an amazing album that I can't get enough of!
0439023521|3.0|I picked this up due to many, many suggestions.  I can see why some people like this book but make no mistake, it's not as great as many are making it out it to be.  Almost every plot twist is just way too convenient or just too predictable.  Too many times, things happen in the book where it makes it turn to a \\"perfect\\" ending.  It's very much along the line of Twilight, in the sense that it contains a lot of the main character thoughts about things that don't really matter.  There are some instances of the author talking about things that the main character would not be likely to know in her situation.  It almost feels as if a teenager wrote this story.  After reading George R.R. Martin books this book seems very amature.  The best way to put it is, reading this book is like, in terms of production quality, an ABC family production compared to a Coen Brothers production.  This book could have been a thousand times better.  But, it does have all the ingredients of being popular with teenagers and teenagers at heart.  The main character is a girl who is very, very self conscious and doubting, yet she is incredibly talented and loved.  One of the main themes is rebellion against those who keep you down.  It has coming of age themes, self discovery, realization of abilities and beauty, and a love story.  Just remember this is a young adult book, so it is not quite as polished or mature as it could be.
B0053B347M|4.0|I think this works basically as described, but I didn't realize before purchasing that it had to be a foot away from a light-colored wall.  It does say that specifically on the product packaging (but not in the Amazon description, as far as I can tell).<br /><br />So, anyway, my monitor is in a corner with about 2-3 feet of space behind it, so the strip is useless.

B00003CX9S|5.0|This is a great movie about the life of John Merrick, a.k.a. The elephant man.  Although it is in black & white, it lends to the realism of the older style of movies which,   in this case, works.  If you've never seen this film you should.  It's heartbreaking and  heartwarming.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|It's Beyonce performing so you know it's nothing but the best!! I was not dissappointed! She is a true talented entertainer. She gives you something new each concert and still gives you some familiar stuff too. It's a must have DVD for Bey stans and anyone who likes true entertainers!
B004EPZ03O|4.0|I was never a big fan of The Muppets, but this movie is special. It gives a nostalgic vibe and an ultimate comeback for the Muppets. I loved the references they made to their tv show, and their previous movies. The jokes were hilarious. The musical numbers were decent. While growing up, Gary and Walter (who is actually a Muppet himself) become obsessed with The Muppets Show. Gary plans a Hollywood Anniversary vacation for his girlfriend, Mary, but Walter comes along too to see the Muppet Theater. When he hears that Tex Richman plans to destroy the theater for oil, Walter tracks down each of the Muppets to help raise $10,000,00 to save the theater and put on the ultimate Muppet Show. Join Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Animal, Rowlf, Swedish Chef, Rizzo, and the rest for the biggest comeback in Muppet history. If you grew up with the show, you'll definitely love THE MUPPETS!!!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|If you want to release an altered version, fine...but make the original also available.  CBS made both versions of \\"Star Trek The Original Series\\" available on Blu-Ray.  Until this Blu-Ray set is in the bargain bin for $19.99, I am going to pass.  Special Thanks to George Lucas for messing up another one of my favorites....because of him, who knows IF we will ever see \\"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\\" unedited and the way it originally aired.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This is the strangest review I have ever written. When someone says a movie is 'sickening', they usually mean either that the movie contained material which caused them to feel revulsion or they are using the word as hyperbole for 'very bad'. I am not using it in either of those senses. When I say this movie was 'sickening' I am using the term literally.  I suffer from motion sickness and have done so ever since I was a child. The effect of the hand-held camera was to cause continuous swaying and jerking of the images on the screen. Whether or not this was an effective way of communicating the message of the film I couldn't tell you. All I can say is that in me it induced severe nausea, such that I had to lie down in a dark room for a couple of hours until the feeling wore off.  My one-star rating is obviously completely subjective, since those who don't share my problem will be able to give reviews based on the entertainment value of the movie and I'm not doing that. However, for me, this was the worst movie that I've ever seen; the only one to have made me physically ill. Fellow motion-sickness sufferers, either skip this movie or dose yourselves well with anti-nausea medication before risking it!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|After much trolling for a good case for my Kindle that proclaims \\"Don't Panic\\" in large, friendly letters on the cover, I settled on this one.  While it may not ease your comforts while gallivanting through space, it at least protects my Hitchhiker's Gui... err, my Kindle Fire and weighs less than my trusty towel.<br /><br />It's got a nice, solid construction; for $30, I get a case that looks nice and feels nice, leaving me with enough money left over for my pan-galactic gargle blaster ingredient run.<br /><br />The cover that folds into a stand is actually really nice.  I wouldn't recommend putting it on an unstable surface, as there isn't a lot of tension holding it when it's in \\"stand\\" form, but it'll work fine to set down on your table while you calculate the improbabilities of a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias spawning in the atmosphere of a planet, spontaneously.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to prevent damage when spilling whatever drink that's not entirely unlike tea, but if you're like me, you'll be a little more cautious with your precious devices when liquids (or Vogon poetry) are around.
B004EPYZPS|3.0|This is really two movies. One is a rather charming film about a group of young film-makers trying to put together a super 8 movie in the late 1970s. Their interaction with each other and with the fathers of the principal boy and girl are well realised and believable, helped along by some excellent performances (I especially liked Joel Courtney's clever differentiation of his delivery when he is acting and when he is 'acting' in the super 8 movie). In the special features director J.J. Abrams refers to his own experiences as a young film-maker and it's clear to see that he is incorporating more than a little of himself in this part of the movie. Four stars for this section of the film.  The other movie is a sci-fi flick about a derailed train and what escapes from it. The two stories are linked together (though only just) by the escape having been caught by the super 8 camera, left running when the train derailment causes the young movie-makers to scatter. This part of Abrams' movie is a tribute to Steven Spielberg, who also participated as a producer. It's not nearly as successful, both because almost everything is derived from Spielberg's movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s and also because hardly anything is given any explanation. We're left sitting there pointing out techniques from Close Encounters or E.T., but not knowing why they're being used. At the end, we know what happened, but not why- and without the why, the whole story makes no sense. Two stars for this part of the movie.  So four stars plus two stars, divided by the two parts of the movie, equals three stars. But do watch the final credits to see how the super 8 movie turned out.

1451627289|5.0|What a Great book by Stephen King!  As one who was in college when the assination of J.F.K. occurred, I believe that this book (even though it is listed as fiction) is actually the best book I have ever read on this subject (already read it twice). And, I really do not like reading books on this subject, because it still brings back awful memories.  Question:  In this book; did Stephen King referance the record album: 'The Genius of Ray Charles\\"?  The first time I read this book, I thought I saw this album noted at the bottom of a page (when he was with Sadie in the cabin?).  The second time I read the book-I could not find this album mentioned. This 1959 album is one of my favorite Ray Charles' albums (on Atlantic Records). If anybody who has this book, could alert me to the answer to my question,[and if it is in the book, what page is this referenced], I would very much appreciate knowing about it.  Or, am I way off base with this album being noted at all in the book \\"11/22/63\\"?
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Awesome, refreshing, and talented new country artist!  I followed his progress on American Idol & cheered when he won.  The song picks are very appropiate for his age and voice.
B004VBAHG6|4.0|I've had a mixed, ambivalent reaction to Peter Murphy's solo stuff. Some songs I like, others don't do anything for me. And I don't really expect much from old rockers.   But this is really good stuff. Has some of the deep abrasiveness I like from the Bauhaus days, and his vocals are as good as ever.  So with a little surprise, I think this is my favorite of his solo albums.

B005HP2JAM|1.0|I am rating this movie based solely on the 3D aspect of the film. The documentary itself is interesting, but this review does not covor the content of the documentary. I read multiple reviews of this documentary before purchaseing this 3d blu ray.  Everything i read convinced me that this was a no brainer purchase. They said the 3d was spectacular, breathtaking, gorgeous. They couldnt have been more wrong. This was not filmed in 3d. It was a post production process, and a very poorly done one at that. You can see many section of the film where they pulled the people out toward the viewer in the film and with them much of the surrounding background, the look of which is very distracting and ugly. Its like this was some film students attempt at post production 3D. Its probably one of the worst post production 3d films i have seen yet. The film quality is very poor and grainy for the majority of the documentary. I would only suggest purchasing this 3d blu ray if you are very interested in the content of the documentary. And then just watch it in 2d.

B004EPYZTE|5.0|Having grown up reading Conan and collecting the pulp art/covers from the books I was simply blown away by this recreation of the movie franchise. Jason Momoa is a dead ringer in every way to what I loved about the character while growing up. A huge fan of the Swarzenegger movies, I wasn't expected too much with this film other than updated special effects. I got far more than I could have expected. Everything about this film appealed to me. The directing, cinematography, script, and the cut above acting style of Momoa. Lot's of action and the story moves smoothly while fast paced. While Swarzenegger defined my view of the character early on, Momoa IS Conan. I felt numerous times that the pulp art had been majically and stunningly brought to life in clear definition the earlier films simply didn't achieve. A 5 star action flick, stunning visuals, and a story that added to the mythos is a fantastic way.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The book was wonderful.  A trip back in time that I lived thru, but was too young to know the political impact at the time. I am so wanting to see this movie in my own home!!!!!  Some ladies at my Church are reading & sharing comments in a class.  My co-workers who have seen it, raive about the movie & followed up with the book.  Trust me, this is the first book I have actually read from cover to cover since \\"The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, including \\"The Hobbit\\" in the 70's. And I am not a reading kind of person.  Give me video or nothing at all!!!  It has been in my \\"wish list\\" since I finished the book. I am rating it a 5 even without seeing it.  I'm sure it won't let me down!!
B006BSMY36|5.0|This episode is full of surprises, twists and turns.  It will have you on the edge of your seat if you have been following Becket's quest to find her mother's assassin and at the same time deal with her demons.

Superb acting, chemistry and writing missing from many tired detective shows on television today. The casting remains impeccable.   Don't miss this one.
0307586901|5.0|Martha Stewart's Handmade Holiday Crafts has fantastic homemade gift and decor ideas from New Year's to Christmas and every holiday in between. There are two hundred and twenty five of the best ideas which have been culled from the vast amount of crafts at Martha Stewart. It is beautifully photographed with clear step-by-step instructions and illustrations for the projects. Each chapter begins with a brief synopsis of each holiday and the common ideas associated with it.<br /><br />I loved the glossy, spooky fun \\"Jar-O'-Lanterns\\", which are made by painting orange enamel paints onto glass jars and adding a wire handle and fun faces with black paint. Lovely pop-up bouquet cards are a perfect Mother's Day gift and the adorable money and gift card wrappers are great for the winter holidays. Martha Stewart's Handmade Holiday Crafts makes it so convenient by having all of these wonderful crafts in one volume, and any one of these suggestions would change a normal holiday celebration into something truly magical!
0439023513|1.0|I love how the 5 star reviewers accuse the lower star reviewers of whining because they didn't get their fairytale ending. Sadly, it is not the case with me. I really should have trusted my instincts and stopped at a 1/3rd of the book.   -Mini Spolier Alert-  While I understand that it's \\"realistic\\" in terms of how war changes you, I don't feel it was any excuse for dragging out all kinds of action just to have the resolutions happen while Katniss is knocked out or while we, the readers, are segueing into something else. I feel everything after the action was brushed over with a shrug of the shoulders. It kind of makes me think that the author didn't care that much about her characters after all. That she had a Katniss-like apathy writing this book. As an avid reader, many authors have proven time and time again that you can take your stories into a completely unforgiving place while still maintaining the original spirit in which the preceding books were written in. The author has completely failed in that aspect.  As for the \\"fairytale ending\\"... I never needed one. At all. I just thought the author would have had the courtesy of tying up loose ends for most of the subplots in strong, sturdy knots as opposed to just hastily bundling it up and presenting it as a finished package.  The good news is that if the third book gets made into a movie, we'll probably enjoy it far more than this depress-apalooza...unless the author elects to write that screenplay as well, then we are screwed.   All I'm saying is that we, the readers, deserved a bit more conviction in the writing. It's not like it was her first book, you know.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|The last record from REM is a fantastic swansong which takes one on an emotional journey.  Officially splitting up as a band, REM leaves behind an incredible legacy as the founding fathers of alternative rock.  Never sounding better, this disk harkens back to their early days minus the unintelligible lyrics.  Awesome guitar work and great male harmonies make this jangly record worthy of multiple listens.  Truly the end of an era, REM has earned their place in the rock and roll history books and this record sees them leaving on top.  Now that's a grand exit!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I received Adele Live at the Royal Albert Hall DVD/CD set today, which I've been looking forward to for a few weeks. Having already watched the DVD, and listened to the CD, here's my review:<br /><br />Let's start with the production value, which is a dicey proposition with concert DVDs. This one was top notch. The director did a nice job of capturing Adele, her songs, and the audience. He didn't get too cute with silly camera tricks or over editing, which is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to concert DVDs. I'm watching the concert to see the show, not what cool tricks you learned in film school. I was very pleased with the production value of this DVD.<br /><br />Moving on to the packaging and content, very simple which equals nice in my book. The box, discs, and booklet have a nice black and white theme to it, which again, captures Adele and her music properly.<br /><br />The DVD includes the concert (duh!) and an 8:30 clip, documenting Adele from literally her first of coffee to the moment she walks onstage. I'm a sucker for that type of stuff, so I enjoyed that--esp since it was brief.<br /><br />Now for the meat of the DVD--the concert itself. I always enjoy watching live Adele clips, because not only does she have a great, great voice, but also a big stage presence. She has this aura about her that I don't think even she realizes at this point in her career. Just magical.<br /><br />The setlist was your typical Adele setlist, with a mix of new/older songs, with a couple of covers thrown in for good measure. Solid setlist. Her voice, however, wasn't the greatest this particular concert. Now, days after filming this show she cancelled the rest of her 2011 tour and had vocal chord surgery and you can tell her voice was tired and not right. It didn't sound bad, it just wasn't the powerful voice I've come to love. Put it this way--an 70% Adele is 100 times better than 99% of the other artists out there, past and present. For that reason, I wish they would have held off until after her surgery to put out this DVD. Perhaps we'll get another one within the next couple of years. I hope so.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this DVD. Like I said earlier, I love live Adele and to have an hour and 41 mins at my disposal is greatness! This DVD makes me want to see her live even more, which will happen once she returns from vocal chord surgery.
0143039431|5.0|It has been said that The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most famous novels in America, perhaps even the world.  John Steinbeck shows that literature can be about real people in real situations.  This novel is timeless.  It speaks to generation after generation.  There may be no greater American author than Steinbeck and this story is surely one of his best.

B002NXSRVG|2.0|I grew up reading the Joe comic book. Snake eyes inspired me to train in martial arts. If they would have made this a straight war movie and allowed Ray Park to show case his actual martial arts skills this could have been one of the best comic book movies ever. The special effects and all of the fake stuff ruined this movie for me. Ray Park has extreme skills that would have been better than the computer generated stuff and wire work. It really confuses me how they can make a \\"live action\\" movie faker than a comic book.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|this disc is absolutley stunning in every way! adele has an amazing voice and writes some beautiful songs.  you can't go wrong with this cd, I highly recommend it.  not one bad track on here, well worth the money.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|What's up with that? I noticed it (a lot) because another reviewer had pointed it out. But I think I would have noticed it anyway. It's a lazy crutch his editor should have caught. You wanna have fun with it? Every time you read shrugged, imagine a big, comedic, overly-dramatic, cartoon-like shrug.  Jack Reacher is a weird character. Somewhat incongruous with his Terminator-like killing/digital threat-assessment skills, and Holmes-like deductive skills. The kind of character a 14 year-old boy would invent. The character shouldn't work, and he almost doesn't. 1 on 5 kill-or-be-killed confrontations are almost too easy for him. But then he also like to sing blues songs in his head, and he has a few other quirks that make him more human.  He needs more. He needs more flaws, foibles and development. He needs to get his ass kicked from time to time. But somehow Reacher doesn't detract from a pretty good plot and story-line. Good page-turner.  I hope Child develops Reacher more and his editor gets \\"shrugged\\" under control in subsequent books, because otherwise this was a good read. Kept me interested. I'll read the next in the series and re-assess after that.
1451627289|5.0|I just finished the book after a six hour stint to get through it from Chapter 17. I've been stealing time during lunch the past few days but today, I reached that delicious point for readers when I just had to know how it would end.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of Stephen King but not a fanatic. I haven't read the Dark Tower books and 'The Stand' gets a little too much for me past the first harrowing section when Captain Trips first rips through and does its deeds. However, I am enough of a fan to know what Captain Trips refers to. I think 'The Mist' is also one of King's best and until this latest book, I thought his best work was that yarn about Andy Dufresne and that old prison up in Maine.<br /><br />I cried when I reached the end of this book for about five minutes. The ending is truly perfect and the way everything is tied together . . . it took my breath away. I went in the bedroom, kissed my sleeping wife because I'm so glad she's there - a good book with a good love story will do that for you - and sat down at the computer to write this.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of time travel fiction and have read a great deal of it. This book has everything that makes good time travel stories fun. I'm so excited that Stephen King's universe had room and the mechanics in place to allow him to tell a great story and that he took the time to write it.<br /><br />Just marvelous. Read it. Go kiss a loved one after reading it and be glad that they're there.

B002JHWI5C|5.0|In the team photo of 'best books I've ever read', I feel a desire to re-read this one every 10 years or so. It's definitely a 'love it or hate it' effort -- in particular, the language used can be off-putting as Hemingway tries to convey the beauty of the Spanish language through the use of archaic English. I think it works, though the necessary linguistic convolutions needed to express obscenities gets tedious.<br /><br />The plot is well-constructed, giving an adequate amount of motion as it moves between the love story and the action sequences. Hemingway's flair for description are on full display -- whether it's the scenery, military weapons, food or people he gets to the heart of the matter swiftly and decisively.<br /><br />The themes Hemingway pursues throughout his career are present in this work -- androgyny, suicide, the outdoors, shooting and depression are all rolled into it. These themes provide layering and texture that helps propel the novel forward without dipping into an emotional morass.<br /><br />A book to treasure, by a master of the art.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have owned my Garmin Forerunner 405CX for about 3 months now and I am a VERY SATISFIED customer!<br /><br />Most importantly, this Garmin really lightened my load.  It replaced my Polar heart rate monitor, my Nike + sensor and ipod and my interval timer.  Now I have all 3 functions, and more, in one device.  I know there are some features that I haven't even fully explored yet.  I was most excited to discover the variety of intervals that I can use. I can program simple intervals based on time or distance.  Or I can program advanced workouts that are based on whatever type of intervals I prefer.<br /><br />The only problem I've had so far...a very minor one...is that sometimes I have to wait a couple of minutes for the GPS to find a satellite signal.  I was in the heart of San Fransisco the very first time I tried to use it and it was really having a hard time finding a satellite signal.  So I waited until I moved closer to the water and farther away from all the tall buildings and presto!  Ever since, it has taken 2-3 minutes max to find the satellite signal...usually less than 1 minute though.

B0067JMJ8E|1.0|This performance from December 1, 2009, despite being well recorded, is the worst I've ever heard by Yes. They're sluggish, under-rehearsed, sloppy, uninspired and disinterested, with no spark or liveliness. Are these guys even enjoying themselves? It sounds like they don't care. While they were a dinosaur band in the late 70s, they're dried-up fossils now. Only Steve manages to recapture the magic of Yes, and only in moments which are brief and fleeting.  Oliver Wakeman can't execute any of his father's parts correctly, nor those of Tony Kaye or Geoff Downes. He sounds like an untalented Intermediate Keyboard student who just got a play-by-numbers book of Yes standards, as he messes up just about anything more complicated than a sustained chord. He's repetitive, monotonous and annoying.  Fifteen years ago it was Steve dragging the pace of the songs down, but now Squire and White have joined him in the sluggish department, with Alan in particular being noticeably limp. Is this just due to the deterioration of age? I suspect not.  Benoit sounds better singing Trevor Horn's parts than Jon's, but his vocals are shrill, piercing, and headache-inducing as he strains for the high notes and has trouble finding them. What's up with his vibrato? Is he nervous or hoping to land on the correct pitch for a fraction of a second? At least on the CD you can't see him spinning around, 'playing' his bongos, and otherwise acting like a jackass. The vocal harmonies are particularly appalling.  I never imagined Yes could play this badly. Here's hoping they improved on their subsequent tours. If not, they should retire and stop embarrassing themselves.

It would totally suck to be around if a disaster of this magnitude ever struck.  Again, not the most amazing movie in my book and not entirely the way I believe the end will come about, but still a very entertaining and intense watch.  I would recommend it.

0060566108|5.0|Authors James Collins and Jerry Porras dig beneath the surface into the business world identifying 18 different \\"visionary companies\\" and look to see what makes these companies different from others in the same industry. What is special about this book is the remarkable job that these authors did in researching and pin pointing key attributes of the visionary companies that make them more successful than their competition.<br /><br /> Collins and Porras, after six years of analyzation, found that all visionary companies met the following criteria: \\"Premier institution in its industry, widely admired by knowledgeable business people, made an indelible imprint on the world in which we live, had multiple generations of chief executives, been through multiple product life cycles, and founded before 1950.\\" The authors then go through detailing how those criteria were met by different companies and how that influenced them in their road to lead there industry in innovation and financial stability.<br /><br /> I was most engaged and interested in their material when they would break down common myths of perceived reasons why companies are successful. Each chapter of the book would analyze a myth related to prominent businesses and bust it. For example, in Chapter 1 the authors outline the 12 different myths that provide the structure for the book. The myth most commonly heard in business is \\"It takes a great idea to start a great company.\\" In the pursuing chapter they describe that 15 of the 18 visionary companies (including Disney, Marriott, and Boeing) did not start with a good idea, but actually started with an idea that did poorly.<br /><br /> I only have a few criticisms for this groundbreaking book. I found that on occasion the authors would treat their readers as if they were completely unintelligent. I am not a well established businessman, quite the contrary, but a few of their statements even offended me. For example, in chapter 10 the author states, \\"If you walk away from this book thinking that the most essential step in building a visionary company is to write...a [mission] statement, then you will have missed the whole point.\\" For someone to even fractionally think that, they would have to have the IQ of a second grader. After having read nine chapters of substantial matter and explanations, no one could possibly think the most important step in establishing a successful business would be to write a good mission statement.<br /><br /> Other than rare instances, like the one mentioned above, the book is fantastic. Before purchasing or renting this book, please do keep in mind that this is not Harry Potter or Twilight. These are not meant to entertain in that way, but if you are interested in business, you will be entertained and engaged.ing that the most essential step in building a visionary company is to write...a [mission] statement, then you will have missed the whole point.\\" For someone to even fractionally think that, they would have to have the IQ of a second grader.

B0057R5XRG|3.0|I am finding what many of the bad reviews have already offered up, so I won't rant.  Very inconsistent video quality.  At times VERY grainy and at other times of blu ray crispness.  Audio quality is superb.  The scene with T-Rex is wonderful.  Using a sound bar with subwoofer makes the living room shake when T-Rex roars.  Overall, worth it if you get it at a discount (I got the Amazon $29.99 deal).  I would wait to see if the price goes down after awhile.  Video quality disappointing, audio quality awesome.

0393316041|4.0|This is an essay collection that chronicles the interesting and wondrous thoughts and tangents of a man, physicist, thinker, humanist, and all time practical joker, Richard P. Feynman. Richard Feynman was a Nobel award winning scientist and physicist whose thoughts and ideas about life and the various problems and situations that arise in it were chronicled into the collection of essays, Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman. Although Mr. Feynman did not write the book word for word, it was transcribed through conversations with his friend, Ralph Leighton .    Feynman's jovial tone is visible in his beginning entries about his life. He discusses his fascination with puzzles and how this fascination was the drive for most of his life. This fascination led him to start a radio repair business at the age of nine and become a nuclear physicist by his late twenties. Kindly, he jokes with the reader about his own supposed \\"brilliance\\" and explains his own tricks for appearing a Super Genius to his colleagues and faculty. With his tone, language, and even material, Feynman dissolves the stereotype of the boring scientist.    In a humorous manner, Feynman is able to discuss serious issues in depth. He discusses his own problems with social anxiety and how he learned how to interactive with others and overcome it to function in the real world. Throughout each essay, Feynman makes himself available and relatable to the reader. He does not come off as anything more than a friend telling you his wonderful and humorous anecdotes about life. His anecdotes about how he created his own signs and symbols for math were relatable and intriguing. He re-wrote math through his own numerical devices and worked out his homework in this innovative and, in his mind, less confusing way. It was only after he showed it to a colleague and they looked at him with a blank face that he realized that \\"innovation is very difficult in the real world\\"(28).     Throughout the collection of essays, Feynmandiscusses his struggle for innovation in a world that is content in stasis. While this is only one example that he delves into, this discussion of innovation in formula highlights Feynman's capability in generalizing a specific problem from his life in a way that any reader could understand. While I have never tried to create my own mathematical language, I relate to this text because I too have tried to write in ways that were uncomfortable for others to understand or interpret. This has caused many people to question and misunderstand my work, like Feynman, but I think that this point of misunderstanding is more powerful than understanding.    At the heart of Feynman psyche lies the soul of an honest practical joker. Whether Feynman talks about the death of his wife, pranks that he played on his students, inventing underwater nuclear generators, or the pranks that were played on him, Feynman retains a geniality and positive outlook only out shined by Santa Claus. His positive outlook on life despite all of its grim and sometimes surprising turns serves as a good role model for anyone to emulate. It does not matter who you are, this is a book that will not only let you into the mind of a genius and unintentional comedian, but it will also allow you to reflect back on yourself and try and construct the more positive and creative

B004FEJ3VY|2.0|my son is obsessed with transformers and we needed an optimus prime. this one looks good but it doesn't transform well. all the pieces of plastic just seem to fall apart when you try to transform it. they don't break, so that's good-- but it gets really annoying pretty fast. specifically, it's the feet, head, and the silver canisters (water tanks?).  I'd recommend this toy for older kids, mostly because they'll have to spend a good amount of time snapping pieces back together again. we also have a bumblebee, rachet, dirge... they all seem to fall apart way less than this optimus prime.
0393064476|5.0|Swerve by Stephen Greenblatt received many honors and acclimations since it was published earlier this year and these accolades are justly deserved. This is one of the best, most erudite books to be published in years.  If anyone wants to understand the differences between Blue staters and Red staters, this is the book that does it. Along with making a credible claim that Botticelli, Descartes, Shakespeare, Newton, Galileo, Thomas Jefferson, Montaigne, the philosophes, Greenblatt demonstrates how Lucretius created the secular culture that is behind the development of human liberty that came with the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.<br /><br />The Middle Ages, with its focus on religion and viewing things through a \\"spiritual lens,\\" probably was about as intellectually stimulating for the average person as life in Mao's China during the cultural revolution only it lasted for 1,000 years..  One viewed nature and the natural world as re-enforcing the rules of Bible and that there were no laws or science that could mitigate man's life on earth.  There are a number of factors that lifted western man out of this abyss-Kenneth Clark viewed the advancement of civilization as something that occurred by the skin of its teeth.  However the gradual rediscovery of ancient texts certainly played a part by shifting the intellectual focus away from pointless theological squabbles and onto useful knowledge. The discovery of the concept of \\"zero,\\" something acquired following the fall of Cordova and the rediscovery of Aristotle is example. However there was much more to be rediscovered.<br /><br />The ancient world was one of choices and lacked the stifling unity that an official church or religion usually insists upon.  There was more than just Aristotle and Cicero as book hunters would discover over the next 300 years and these would shakeup civilization immensely.<br /><br />Greenblatt makes a strong case that if any book had an impact on Western Civilization, it was \\"On the Nature of Things\\" by Lucretius.  During ancient times, there were a number of schools that existed in Athens along with those founded by Plato and Aristotle. There were Stoics and Cynics.  However the epicureans and their materialist view of life and emphasis on simple pleasure were a group apart.<br /><br />Lucretius was a Roman who lived in the last days of the Roman republic whose work was know for influencing both Virgil and Horace (who appeared about a generation after).  The epicureans, with their emphasis on earthly pleasure and denunciation of the creaky metaphysics of Plato, were a group apart from many philosophers.  They also tended to regard the world as a collection of atoms and space, which was in a constant state of flux, of creation and destruction, quite at odds with Aristotle's notion of substances being permanent.<br /><br />Lucretius also urged man to give up the fears that lead to his tendency to create gods and religions as means of addressing them.  Lucretius believed that this fear could be dismissed if man understood that the world was a series of atoms and natural phenomenon.  In a sense it was about expectations.  Grandiose expectations fueled great fears fueled great irrationalities.  In Aristotle all things may have had their purpose and role in an orderly universe, Lucretius felt matter was capable of all manner of random activity. The gods were too distant to notice or care about the concerns of man.<br /><br />While the ideas of the epicureans were held in disdain by other schools, in those days in which there was not an authority to condemn ideas, this disdain was limited to polemical tracts, many of which were lost.<br /><br />The destruction of classical civilization was part of the cultural agenda of the Middle Ages. If it did not reinforce Christian dogma it was dangerous and so texts were allowed to disintegrate.  Hundreds of works are no more and remained unknown by most of Western Europe for almost 1000 years.<br /><br />The rediscovery of Aristotle who was very important in the development of Islamic civilization, served as spur the search for other books. Far from being only a high-minded pursuit, many of these books were supposed to have magical properties.  Given the choice between a book on Egyptian magic or Plato's Symposium, a Florentine merchant opted for the former.<br /><br />The rediscovery of Lucretius by Poggio Bracciolini, a papal bureaucrat searching for manuscripts of ancient texts in 1417 allowed for the ideas of materialism to live anew.  Over time, as Greenblatt demonstrates, this rediscovery would cause a shift in the intellectual firmament and enrich the civilization of the west.  The return of Lucretius would provide the background for Botticelli's \\"Primavera\\" (this is a pictorial take on the opening line of \\"On the Nature of Things\\").  Many elements of Lucretius found their way into the works of Shakespeare, the materialist view, which stood in opposition to Aristotle's orderly universe, would also promote the scientific enquiries ranging from Copernicus, Newton and Galileo.ivilization, served as spur the search for other books.

0385535139|4.0|I'm a big fan of John Grisham and have enjoyed all of his novels to date.<br /><br />The basic story line of The Litigators is this - Harvard grad David Zinc decides to abandon his $300+K/yr job working 80+ hrs a week as an associate at a large (3000+ lawyers) Chicago firm, and by chance finds himself at the \\"boutique\\" law firm of Finley & Figg, ambulance chasers who are barely making a living hustling cases and advertising cheap no-fault divorces. They soon find themselves involved in a major product liability case v a large drug company (represented by David's former law firm), and suddenly Finley & Figg are in Federal Court against the Big Guys, and totally unprepared for it. At the same time as this is going on, Zinc stumbles into a separate case representing the family of a child who is severely brain damaged from lead poisoning due to a poor quality childs toy.<br /><br />It is an entertaining story and I enjoyed it. At the same time, it lacked the suspense, twists and turns, and surprises that the best of Grisham's novels have had. The characters are reasonably well developed and interesting, with the trademark Grisham wisecracks and cleverness. If you have enjoyed previous Grisham novels, then you will enjoy this one, but I doubt that you will consider it to be in the same category as [[ASIN:0440245923 The Firm]], or [[ASIN:0385339607 The Rainmaker]], to pick just two of his earlier works.<br /><br />I debated between rating this 3 or 4 stars, and ended up giving it 4 stars for this reason - I respect John Grisham (and Lee Child is another) for continuing to write his own books, and I hope that he continues to do so. A number of best-selling authors now seem to be setting up veritable assembly-line operations, in some cases churning out multiple novels each year, trading on their name but relying upon a co-writer to help to produce one book after another. OK, that is one way to do it, but I finally quit reading James Patterson (who seems to have pioneered this phenomenon, or at least is making the most use of it) after observing his output sky-rocket and the quality level plummet.<br /><br />One book a year from John Grisham is good enough for me, but I do hope that his next book has more surprises and a more compelling story.making the most use of it) after observing his output sky-rocket and the quality level plummet.

B004H4XLRE|5.0|Bought this for my son 6 months ago for his 5th birthday and he still plays with it constantly. It is great to bring on trips to the grandparents, because even thought there are only 10 slots, you can fit 2 cars in each slot for transport purposes. The only warning, my son wanted the exact 10 cars (their numbers are listed over each racing slot)that are listed, and some are hard/expensive to find..he is still waiting on a couple. Keep in mind the plastic lightening mcqueen that comes with it is pretty useless, not good for racing against all the other diecast cars. But my son has used this almost daily for 6 months and it has held up beautifully. And it offers me some time to myself since he can play with it for quite a while on his own. Win win!

B0015DYIH2|1.0|This was a terrible book. I couldn't even finish it. Someone please explain to me what is so attractive about this book and the film that was just released. I get that Robert Pattinson is apparently very cute and all, but what is it that is so \\"amazing\\" about this series. Before you attack me, I have read all the books (well, 3/4 of Breaking Dawn) and seen the movies (thought I haven't seen Breaking Dawn and am not sure I want to.) I honestly loved the love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob, but from New Moon and on, the characters and plot just really went downhill. So Twihards, no judgment and no criticism, but tell me what has got you hooked on this saga. I'm curious.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I can honestly say that I like the first two books better that than the third, however, it does feel weird to lose the \\"chemistry\\" between Katniss and Peeta, since his unrequited love for her gave Katniss that extra personality.  In the first part of the book she was with her freind, Gale, and became the face of the rebellion and it just seemed a little off.  Also, the sequence of events are not predictable, but you can figure that certain things will happen.  I also think that the mental state that is given to Katniss and Peeta are more realistic, given their circumstances.  However, it seems that the end had to put events in there to ensure things balanced out.  These scenes are a little more gory, but this book is more Animal Farmish, we see that we have two extreme ideologies crashing together and how people are often dazzled into thinking a certain way.<br />However, as a talking point, one thing that it does make you think about is how news presents the news and what is actually occuring in actuality.  How certain circumstances and certain people make things happen that may not neccessarily be seen?  It also brings into light the issue of teenagers that are brought into the spotlight?<br />I would recommend reading this book, in fact in way, I wish that series started backwards from this book.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|This movie was great, in all aspects.  Unlike some of the others reviews, there were no stupid scenes, no unrealistic stories.  If you are a traveler, like myself, and have lived in different states and countries, then you will realize the characters are portrayed accurately.  I am from the south, and yes, Mama Jenny was portrayed like typical southerners; welcoming, always cooking home cooked meals, and going to church.  The fact that she was African American and overweight, only made me appreciate more the different races and cultures we have in the world, and how we all can learn to be accepting, no matter our color.  The story of his son was also very real, being that bullies and racism exist more and more in schools now.  Being a nurse, I have also worked with many patients with Autism, so for the autistic character to take a journey like he did in this story, it makes the movie inspirational.  I was cheering him on the whole time!  Sadly, when he was tortured, that too was portrayed accurately, but only made the movie more real.  Everyone has their own interpretation of the movie, but this movie is not for those with closed minds, those who have never traveled out of their comfort zone, and those who are critical of judging others.  I highly recommend this movie for those who want to understand what else there is in life, those who enjoy a good cry, a good laugh, and who just want to see a great movie!

0316098337|5.0|This book drew me in and kept me completely in its world until the last page.  From the subject matter, one will wonder how much horror one will experience by reading it.  Because the reader \\"hears\\" the story from the boy's point of view, the reader has some \\"protection\\" from the traumatic events, because the mother in the story  protects her son from the trauma.  The reader knows more than the innocent child about what must have occurred or what is occurring in the story, but he, nor the reader, do not directly \\"see\\" it.  Ma keeps her son protected and creates a safe feeling for him and that feeling is imparted to the reader as well.-The story reminded me a little bit of The Curious Incident of a Dog in the Night Time, which deals with sad experiences (totally different than this story), but is told from the point of view of someone who is somewhat innocent and who is trying to understand the world.  I am sensitive about reading painful sad or frightening stories, (I hated the book The Lovely Bones-also about an abduction) but the reader in this story is very aware of the hope and love of the characters, which gives it an emotional balance.  There are many insights into the relationship between mother and child, about viewing our society through the lens of someone completely \\"alien\\" to it, and about psychological vulnerability and strength.<br /><br />The characters are very real and human.  Ma is brilliant at keeping keeping her son safe and creating a world for him in the room where they are captive.  Still, she has her moments where she succumbs to her own feelings and is not always available to her son.  Which is normal for any parent-even one who is not in such a horrible situation.  The language of the story is the language that the boy has learned to use in their isolated  room and is very interesting in terms of how one might create their own way of communicating when one lives in a world consisting of only 2 people.<br /><br />I don't want to say any more because the I read the book without knowing the plot and I don't want to ruin it for anyone else.  I highly recommend it.the book without knowing the plot and I don't want to ruin it for anyone else.  I highly recommend it.

044661758X|5.0|I am making my way through all the Harry Bosch novels. I am addicted. No matter which one you read first, regardless of the order of the novels, you will be very curious to read the rest. I thought Black Ice was my favorite, but the Concrete Blonde is right up there. I was right there on the edge of my seat - viscerally hating the prosecuting attorney, living the present day murder investigation, and not at all ready for the ending. You really have to read this one.  I am now reading Angel's Flight - and it is very good as well. I'm not quite halfway through. Makes me want to stay home from work and just read. Very, very addictive.....  I lived in L.A. for over 20 years, and Connelly brings the city to life. It is clear he loves it. With his words, I can picture the seedy sidewalks in the Valley, the wreckage of the city after the riots in 1992. This novel makes you taste the squalor, the glamor, the jadedness and the extremes of life so poignant in L.A. But this novel will bring you from the courtroom to the sidewalks, to the urgency of Harry Bosch's life - and you will be on his side every step of the way.
B00004SU5J|5.0|I heard \\"Rose Rouge\\" on XM channel Watercolors (Smooth Jazz) and was immediately hooked on the intoxicating, repeating rhythm.  I'm a big fan of Philip Glass, often described as minimalist, which I would describe as \\"soothingly repetitive\\".  I had never heard of St Germain and was not familiar with any of his music.  I checked out the other tracks on \\"Tourist\\" through samples on Amazon and decided it was worth a purchase.  I've had it for a few months now and that initial impact has hardly diminished.  It is one of the very few albums of mine where ALL of the tracks are very, very good.  It really appeals to my desire to listen to rich, repetitive music.  I like to take long car trips and this music is PERFECT for that.  The road is monotonous and endlessly repetitive and the rhythm of most songs on \\"Tourist\\" make it a very enjoyable experience for me.  It puts me in a euphoric trance that just melts away an hour on the road.  I can really engage in deep, contemplative thought so rare to find in this attention-deficit, distracting world we live in.

0439023521|5.0|This is an amazing story.  I've read hundreds of books, and the Hunger Games series is absolutely on my list of all-time favorites.  It tells the story of a not-so-distant future, where the government is in complete control and forces citizens to compete in their annual Hunger Games.  The main character is Katniss, a girl who will do everything she can to protect her family.<br />It's about bravery, love, courage in the face of your greatest fears, sacrifice, never giving up.<br />I swear once you start reading, you'll finish the 3 book series in a week or two.  I really can't imagine you'd be disappointed.
0064471837|2.0|This was originally a response to another review, but I found that this description was getting very in-depth, so I decided to publish it as a review.<br /><br />I have read other books by Nix so thought I would like this one, but the world was badly constructed and the characters flat.  It does not shock me that other books he has written since then are much better.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is that the world makes more sense.  Nix throws you right in with few descriptions along the way.  As an as-yet-unpublished writer, I would be the first to admit that telling readers about a world is /hard/, but there is a balance that Nix strayed much too far on one side of.  I was floundering in a foreign world where I was expected to follow a story.<br /><br />The characters were...flat.  Dead.  Doll-like.  Much too predictable.  Kind of creepy.  The one character I loved was the cat-demon Mogget, who was cynical and hilarious (admittedly he was only nice because he was captured by the spell of a bell, but beggars can't be choosers). The romance between Sabriel and Touchstone (gasp!  I gave it away!) felt completely fabricated, and I wasn't very fond of the way they met.  (Umm...he was a figurehead?  Creative, I guess, but creepy...)<br /><br />My personal opinions aside, Nix's writing improved astronomically between this and The Keys to the Kingdom (Book 1 published in 2003).  The writing here was not very good--dull and bland with too much denseness.<br /><br />Please do not mistake this as punishing the author--I'm 90% sure this is his first novel.  (Don't hold me to that).  Although it has some upsides, the downsides outweigh them.  Normally I adore Nix's writing (The Keys to the Kingdom series I mentioned above is on my Top 20 Series/Books list), but here it just didn't resonate with me.  I don't want to discourage you from giving it a try, though--maybe you'll like it better than I did!

B005B0QYMM|5.0|Grave encounters is probably one of the best horror movies i've seen this year. i saw the trailer for grave encounters a while ago and started searching non-stop to find it but i just couldn't find a dvd then when i stopped looking is when it came out. when i went to watch it at first i wasn't expecting to get much of a movie. To be honest, this movie freaked me out more then any of the paranormal activity movies. this is definitely among my favorite ghost movies.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|The enjoyable, moving \\"The Descendents\\" (written and directed by Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings) smartly depicts how a major development in a family- in this case, a tragedy- immediately steamrolls and negates all petty drama and grievances, and quite efficiently illuminates everyone's true colors and true feelings.<br /><br />George Clooney is terrific as Matt King, a marginal parent who all of a sudden is thrust into the role of central parent and responsibility bearer when a boating accident puts his wife Elizabeth into a coma.  Things become more complicated when it becomes clear that Elizabeth isn't going to wake up, and that her legal wishes indicate that she doesn't want to be kept alive via artificial means if a situation like her current one ever arose.<br /><br />Despite the subject matter, the film isn't relentlessly sad.  It's nice to see the strong bond that immediately develops between Matt and his oldest daughter Alexandra (beautifully played by Shailene Woodley), who tosses aside the usual teen issues that drove a wedge between her and her parents in recent years, and starts helping her dad put her mother's affairs in order and prepare for her funeral.<br /><br />And when I use the word \\"affairs\\" above, I don't just mean finances and legal stuff.  Matt soon learns from his daughter that he wasn't the only imperfect spouse in their family, though he is shocked to learn exactly what his wife was up to during her last months.<br /><br />With the help of his family, and one or two hangers-on, Matt puts things to rest during the course of the movie, resulting in situations that are funny, sad, moving, sometimes ridiculous, but always very human.  It's interesting that Matt's forgiveness of his wife's infidelity comes fairly early on (though residual anger surfaces here and there), because there's work to be done. Despite what he's learned, he's determined to put his wife to rest with dignity and love, and to honor her memory properly with friends and family.<br /><br />Filling out the movie are some beautiful locations in Hawaii, a quirky subplot involving Matt and Alexandra trying to locate Elizabeth's secret lover (despite their negative feelings about that part of her life, they want to give the guy the opportunity to properly say goodbye to her), and another subplot involving a major land deal being overseen my Matt, which ultimately ties into the movie's theme of identifying what's really important in life.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Descendents\\" is an involving family drama that honestly earns the emotions it brings forth. And, really, don't let the premise scare you off.  You'll likely leave the film feeling upbeat and chatty, ready to discuss the film's humor and humanity.g out the movie are some beautiful locations in Hawaii, a quirky subplot involving Matt and Alexandra trying to locate Elizabeth's secret lover (despite their negative feelings about that part of her life, they want to give the guy the opportunity to properly say goodbye to her), and another subplot involving a major land deal being overseen my Matt, which ultimately ties into the movie's theme of identifying what's really important in life.

B000OCY7JE|4.0|'After The Wedding' is a wonderful Danish film. It gives us a range of emotions, and the acting is superb.<br /><br />Jacob, played by Mads Mikkelsen, manages an orphanage in India. He and his group are looking for funding to keep the orphanage afloat. He gets word that a man with influence and money wants to see him before he will give money to the orphanage. Jacob reluctantly returns to Denmark. Here he meets Jergen, played by Rolf Lasagard, who wants to be his benefactor. This man has power, too much money and Jacob is not impressed. It appears that Jergen wants to think about the funding over the weekend, in the meantime, he invites Jacob to his daughter's wedding. This is where the film takes off. At the church Jacob recognizes Jergen's wife, Helena. Helena, played by Sidse Babett Knudsen, is shocked to see Jacob- we understand right away that they had a relationship. During the wedding and reception, we come to also understand that Jacob is probably the father of the bride. This is quite a soap opera. However, this is only the beginning. Jergen has plans, and as the film evolves we see that instead of the ogre, he may have planned something. He is not thhe uncaring man, he seems to be. Jergen has a scene that is masterful and one of the best I have seen.<br /><br />'After The Wedding' shows us what sacrifice is all about. Jacob for his orphans and Jergen for his family. This is a film that shows the difference between classes and the goodness in people. The acting by all is admirable. Afterall, we are told tht charity begins at home.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 11-30-11
1599218011|5.0|I stumbled upon this book when I was looking for a different book on vegetarianism.  I have been a vegetarian for over 16 years and wanted to delve in even deeper to info about my chosen lifestyle.  While the language she uses is a bit overboard and colorful, it is absolutely packed with valuable information all in one place! A juicer is on my wish list but I am already working on the supplements she suggests.  So very pleased with this book.  One of the rare ones that provides so much information in one spot.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Totally hilarious.  A wonderful way to waste your time when you have 'way too much on your list to be doing anything else but concentrate on what else you need to be doing and when playing Angry Birds is so outrageously inappropriate that it just calms you right down.

B006B31B80|1.0|this show had a good thing going...and then they tried to paint southerners as racist republicans and lost their dignity and potential. a sad turn in season 2, but luckily it happened early enough in the season that it's hard to care what happens in the future.  evil destroys itself.
B004KRQFI0|4.0|The best new techno since the Crystal Method released Vegas in 1997 and the Prodigy put out The Fat of the Land around the same time, good stuff here! [[ASIN:B000002NFM Fat of the Land]] and the holy grail: [[ASIN:B000002RBV Vegas]]
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read in years until I got my first Kindle a year ago for a trip to London. Then I read my first SK novel, then his short stories, and couldn't stop. Had to have more.  I just finished 11/22/63 and LOVED IT.   On our recent Thanksgiving trip, my husband commandeered my Kindle while I was mid-way through the book, so I read the last 1/2, more or less on my iPhone.  I just didn't want to lose any time getting to the next thrilling part.    This would make a wonderful movie, but now that I've read some of his earlier works, and recall what some of directors, screen writers have done to his novels (The Shining) - yuck.  Maybe it's better left alone in print form.    It's a gem and I highly recommend it, especially to my 60+ peers, who will love the world he recreates for us in 1958.  \\"Ah, yes, I remember it well.\\"
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I have to say I was very disappointed when I was expecting to load HP 7 Part 2 onto my iPad for my trip tomorrow.  No can do without a download of some other app!  WHAT?!?!  Ok, I'll watch it on my AppleTV tonight....NOPE!  CAN'T do that either.  Ok, then on my computer.....not without install some custom software!  SERIOUSLY!!!  Talk about a POOR decision to go with this terrible product called ULTRAVIOLET!  They should have stuck with what worked, normal iTunes redemption.  I fell cheated and I certainly didn't get what I paid for!  My copy of HP 7 Part 1 has this garbage too, now I payed for 2 movies that I won't get to use!!!
B001TWT0AE|5.0|The DVD was perfect.  It arrived quickly. As usual, the items I get through Amazon.com are always the very best.
1594203059|5.0|Another excellent book by Niall Ferguson.  He has a wonderful knack for making it easy to understand the historical ramifications that affect our past and present day crises and the West's declining stature in the scheme of things.
B004EPZ06G|3.0|\\"It happened again, we lost Teddy\\"  Stu (Helms) is getting married...again.  Phil (Cooper), Doug and Alan are at the bachelor party...again.  They drink too much and wake up in a strange hotel room with a lost friend...again.  They try to find clues to where thier friend is and things keep getting worse and worse...again.  If you liked the first one I would be weary of this one.  It's pretty much the same movie with a little changes.  A monkey instead of a tiger.  An old guy instead of a baby.  Bangkok instead of Vegas. A tatoo instead of losing a tooth.  I think the main problem with this movie is that the first one came out of nowhere and surprised everyone with how funny it was.  After making a ton of money a sequel had to be made.  The only problem is that this type of movie doesn't lend itself to a sequel.  So they did they only thing they could.  I would call this more of a remake then a sequel, and much like all remakes it's not as good as the original.  Overall, very disapointing after the classic first one.  I give it a B-.<br /><br />*Also try - Cedar Rapids & Hangover Part 1
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I find myself skipping pages already and Im only 20% into the book. I just skipped an entire chapter because I didnt care about what was happening to the character. The problem is Martin has a great story, but my god, TOO much detail. Where is the plot, where is the action, where is the actual story? Martin is a great story teller, but do I really need to know every single persons thoughts? I've grown attached to certain characters, stop introducing more I dont care about, just get back to the plot!! I have questions from two books ago that haven't been touched in over 1,500 pages! I think Martin has too much to tell and not enough focus. Move the story a long, you've got enough character development. I dont care about everyone's past, get onto their present or future! Between what I've read so far and his last book, I think Im just watching icicles drip; its taking too long to see whats underneath.
B005SJIP2S|1.0|There is nothing redeeming about this album. The musicianship is flawless but utterly uninspired. The vocals are shakey and completely uninspired. The song selections are lacking. The crowd sounds bored. Yes sounds like a bad parody of itself. If you are looking for a Yes live album, get YesSongs or YesShows.  I have nothing against this lineup. I enjoyed Fly From Here, and may listen to it again after writing this review. But if In The Present is indicative of Yes' live performances these days, then I'm glad I've skipped the last couple tours.  This album is just unspeakably awful! I hope Yes rebounds yet again sometime down the road.
B004VF68AQ|4.0|Bought this and i think it continues on from strays. not sure why people keep going on about it not being as good as nothings shocking?. Metallica will never do another black album so get over it. As far as modern Janes goes its a great listen and agreeing with an earlier review it gets better after more plays. like strays which produced the really good track \\"superhero\\" which is great live, i am sure tracks like underground will be fantastic live. Perry, Dave and co great stuff keep going fellas
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|I have been a music collector for 30 years and listen to all kinds, so I know a little about music. I grew up in the 80's listening to hair bands, and I can tell you that Balls Out is pure 80's metal! Yes it's potty humor. Yes it's lyrics are simple. Yes it rocks!! No matter what everyone else says in their reviews...Michael Starr CAN sing, and he sings his ass off! Satchel plays guitar like nobody's business! The songs are catchy and do make you smile...even laugh out loud in some parts. The lyrics can be sexist but they are meant to be tongue in cheek. I, personally, hadn't heard them before this CD came out but I do plan on buying their next one not to mention the first one and all the singles they have released. Steel Panther is an amazing band top to bottom and I HIGHLY recommend you buy this CD, but only if you have an open mind, sense of humor, and the ability to have your socks ROCKED OFF!!!!!
0061474347|5.0|One of the many reasons I love this book is that I can truly identify with the heroine. Lirael is a loner, bookish, with an inner life she can't share with others. She is fascinating! Nix doesn't turn her into a cheerleader or hanger-on for a male character when she discovers her hidden talents; he lets her be a powerful person who still is different from others. Her vocation isolates her, and that's not a bad thing. She isn't girly but she is a girl, and her personality is delightful, especially in the company of her Dog. I loved this book more than all the others, and I wish it had been around when I was young and feeling so different from everyone else. Nix's heroines ARE different and will remain so throughout their trials, but they have a calling, which makes it all right. Why can't other writers produce great female characters like these (ahem, JK Rowling, who makes Hermione a swat for seven years only to end up marrying that mope Ron and working in a candy shop?!)  Anyway, if you like these books, check out Susan Fletcher's Dragon trilogy. They are great fantasy stories about young women with special powers too, with tons of atmosphere.  More Abhorsen stories, please!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have this app on my Fire and have not had any problems using it.  We were under a winter storm watch yesterday and the red exclamation point told me something was coming before my local channel did.  This is the best app I have downloaded so far.

B005SJIP2S|1.0|Nothing gets old faster than a group with decades and decades and decades of great material behind them always opting to record the same songs on their live albums because those are the biggies that everyone wants to hear and will help sell the album.  -- (Enter sound of Bruce Willis' Jeopardy buzzer from Die Hard -- Egggghhhh.) --  I specifically decided not to buy this album today because they chose not to wait and release a live CD from the Fly From Here tour. Now THAT would have been in the present.  I'll pick this up at some point, but simply having Benoit David sing the vocals is not reason enough for me at this time. I LOVE the Fly From Here album, so his voice is great, and I have nothing against him singing these songs. He undoubtedly does superb renditions of them. It has nothing to do with him. This just strikes me simply as crass marketing and a means to cash in on the good sales of Fly From Here.  Far better to have waited and included some of the new material. I was looking forward to it a great deal. Very, very disappointing.  I bought the Crimson Projekct's Scarcity of Miracles instead.
1610452607|5.0|I absolutely loved this audiobook. Charles Dickens was such a brilliant writer and this is surely one of his most loved stories. Considering its an old story that has been told many times before, it still comes across as very relevant in today's economic situation.   Simon Vance's narration is perfect and adds so much to the story. I particularly liked the way he interprets Scrooge all the way through his transformation, from the grumpy old miser to a jolly old man at the end. He did very well with the different characters voices and he held my attention throughout. I definitely was transported back to Victorian London whilst listening.  I would recommend this audio to everyone, but especially to those who feel jaded by the commercialisation of Christmas. It will definitely cheer you up and bring you a merry Christmas once again.  Thanks to christianaudio.com Reviewer's Program for this free copy.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Looking for a watch has been a journey for me so far. While browsing through Amazon's wide arrays of watch selection, SNK809 strikes me as plainly intricate and resembles a craftsmanship's beauty. With no hands modeled for distraction and the eclipse layout is stunningly strong in quality, as well as perfection. The watch's surface is brilliantly crafted, and while the canvas material may seem generic, it's nonetheless durable.<br /><br />As I was putting it on, I was slightly struggling with the buckles and it may fluster some people, but its concrete quality will never fade. The luminous glow is wonderfully captured and constellations of stars appears in every detail.Despite that the timepiece wasn't accurate in full efficiency, I wasn't dismayed, rather I view it as a sense of parental care. An automatic watch that symbolizes simplicity, elegance, and craftsmanship's intellectual significance, has proved its value.<br /><br />The verdict:<br /><br />The watch is visually appealling, solid durability and nearly consistent timing could steal anyone's heart.<br /><br />For some individual, the crown placement, mediocre size, and style may not interest them at all.
098357670X|4.0|This a great book.  A sistematic, imagery and cool way to explain every point of how to understand caricature.  The illustrations are very awesome and colorful.  The only negative is about the binding [glued, not stitched]. In a few days, the sheets got loose and I had to rebinding it.
1582701709|5.0|I normally don't write reviews, but felt I had to, I literally ordered this book, 11/26, and payment had not gone through, so Monday I got a chance to fix that and by Tuesday 11/29 I had it. Talk about FAST service. Also the book is perfectly new. Thank you so much!
1451627289|4.0|I want to start by saying that on the whole I actually really enjoyed this book, in fact I would daresay for the bulk of it I absolutely loved it.  This book was at times humorous and touching, and you found yourself rooting for the books protagonist.  As you go through the book you get the feel that you actually know the characters and what makes them tick, thanks in part to King's writing of them.  And if the book had ended about 40 pages sooner I would have probably given it 5 stars.  However the book sadly went on for another 40 or so pages, and thats when things took a turn for the worst.  The ending to this book, without giving anything away, is a trite M. Night Shyamalan style twist, and much like Shyamalan's style, it just doesn't work.  The ending is so completely disjointed that it really doesn't at all jive with the rest of the book.  When it got to a point where it reveals certain information about a pretty serious plot point, I literally smacked my forehead and gave a big groan, I couldn't believe that King was going to go the route he was going.    To make matters worse King reveals certain information about certain characters in this ending, but then doesn't even bother to explain what he has written.  It leaves you with some serious questions, which would have been nice if they had been answered.  (Although even if they had been answered, it still wouldn't have made the ending any better.)  I can think of a few ways the book could have ended that would have not only made far more sense, but would be just plain better.  Like I said, I still like this book, and I would recommend it as well.  However I am still shaking my head and wondering what King was thinking when he went the route he did for the ending.  I find it truly baffling.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I have never felt compelled to write a review until now.  All I can say is avoid this product as the plastic is cheap, it feels cheap, and it looks cheap.  Why the premium price is a mystery.  The main half of this case is a cheap plastic tub the Fire sits in while the other is vinyl-covered cardboard.  A glued elastic band holds it shut, but doesn't seem like it will last for long.  There's a reason the price was dropped ten bucks, but even at that price point I cannot recommend this shoddy product.  Maybe $5 with the understanding you'll want to replace it soon.  Defective design means it doesn't stand up reliably -  is going back to Amazon ASAP.  Why there are some positive reviews baffles me.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|The first book was my favorite and it was well written. As the story continued to the next books the story line got stranger and stranger. WICKED got meaner and meaner. It just didn't live up to my expectations. The ending was some what dull and not quite satisfying. I expected more, this was just a means to an end. Boo. There were also times I almost fell asleep, which isn't good since I was driving and listening... That's how dull it was.
0375831002|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read hundreds. It's great to see it from Death's view point and I didn't want to put it down. This is definitely a book I'd recommend to anyone.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Let me start by saying, this is the first time I've ever written a review. Never before I felt compelled to share my experience. But this movie was something else. I have probably seen all the animated movies of the last decade and a half (side effect of having 4 kids). Some I liked, a few I really liked, but majority of them were just nor very good.   I was out with a friend, the movie selection was poor, by default we settled on this one (me, very half-heartedly, not wanting to watch ANOTHER animated movie, especially when I didn't have to).   The story line is so creative and smart, the characters are very well developed and so loveable with all their strengths and short-comings. The movie is outrageously funny while being genuinely innocent (funny thing to say about a movie of EVIL). I can't tell you how many times I teared up from laughing so hard. I instantly fell in love with this movie. The rest of the night I couldn't stop talking about Megamind, the catch phrases, the jokes. I couldn't wait to share it with the kids. Megamind fan forever.
160059672X|3.0|The picture on the cover seems terrifc looking at it here.  After receiving this book (and two other similar books), most of the projects are abstract and gaudy.  There is very little in these books of any worthwhile content.  I wanted to return this book and the other 2, but Amazon will not let me know how much my refund would be, (deduct for shipping or not?) so I am stuck with them.  I will now only look for used books  because these books, in particular, are an absolute waste of money.<br /><br />8/15/12 update - Didn't want to be so hard in my reviews, so I want to add an update. I still don't think there is much oh-so worthwhile in this book, but I think it also depends on your taste in jewelry. On the plus side - it is somewhat inspirational. Since I was stuck with the book I have browsed it many times and decided if I wanted to make a project from it that I could alter the design (but I am a novice) to my own liking. I should have tried to find this book in a local bookstore to browse through it before buying.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|The good: handled a .xlsx file that Quickoffice Pro could not.  Maybe it was a 2010 version?  Issues:   Anyone else notice it seems MUCH slower handling multiple page PDFs than its rivals?  It seems to want to regenerate the PDF image with each flip of the page.   Also, it keeps showing an update available every time it's opened but bounces you to the Android market which wants $9.99 for the update.  I'd think updates would be free for a little while if this is truly a paid app being offered as free for just one day.  Anyone know if Amazon will offer the update free eventually?
1400069181|5.0|I truly loved this book. I falsely assumed it was just a book about how TOMS began, and why we should do something that makes a difference too. It is truly so much more.<br /><br />The book does begin with the TOMS story - how could a book written by Blake Mycoskie start any other way? It is a story that I thought I knew well. Turns out I only knew part of it. The story is so brilliant, a story that you would expect to find in a movie, not in a profitable, well-liked company. But that is exactly the point Blake is making. Story is important.<br /><br />Blake shares six elements that will challenge and inspire you. And because of Blake's strong belief in story, he makes all his points by sharing others' stories with you. Stories about businesses that keep things simple and trust their employees. Stories about college students who were inspired by TOMS and started their own initiatives.<br /><br />As Blake says, \\"A good story transcends boundaries, breaks barriers, and opens doors. It is a key to not only starting a business but also to clarifying your own personal identity and choices.\\"<br /><br />And ultimately, that's what this book is about. Finding your own story. No one's story is alike. Yours may lead you to start your own business that makes a difference in the world. Or it may take you to a new country to volunteer with a nonprofit. Or perhaps you are already right where you need to be in your story.<br /><br />The beautiful thing is, there are no wrong turns. Oh, there are absolutely mistakes. Even Blake admits to making mistakes (the Airstream shoe, for one). All the mistakes, bad ideas, and failures are what make your story great. You can't have the good without the bad, right?<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book. I hope it challenges you the way it has challenged me. And if you need more incentive, you should know that 50% of the proceeds Blake receives from the book will be used to support literacy through the Start Something That Matters Fund.
B003L77GGA|5.0|Perhaps this might help should you be considering acquiring the Blu-ray release of [[ASIN:B003L77GGA Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray]]] in addition to or in lieu of purchasing [[ASIN:B004XWLN20 Smallville: The Complete Series]].  Both of my orders arrived in the same box from Amazon an hour ago and I performed a quick A-B comparison of the opening scene from the last episode \\"Finale\\" in addition to the 3 special features included as part of the Season 10 release to determine the amount of difference both visually and sonically.  Having watched the original CW broadcasts in HD, the Blu-ray version is far superior viewing experience.  This is particularly evident in the medium and wider master shots, black level detail (crushes more on the DVD's) with a much more expansive sound stage (5.1 DTS HD Master Audio on the Blu-rays verses 5.1 Dobly Digital on the DVD's) offering much more enveloping atmospherics with cleaner, more distinct vocals.  By comparison, in addition to the expected lower picture resolution, the sound field is much more biased to the front sound stage with voices recorded at a lower comparable volume level sounding slightly compressed on the DVD's verses the Blu-ray's.  [[ASIN:B004XWLN20 Smallville: The Complete Series]] ultimately is a very impressive series package featuring exceptionally well done content (will take some time to read all 16 pages of the Daily Planet) that I already feel was well worth the money even if I haven't yet had the time to view any of it yet.  I understand Warner's decision concerning the reasons why this was not released on Blu-ray.  As you view the special features (especially the one on the 200th episode \\"Homecoming\\"), the difference between the clips from most recent shows along with the interviews shot for the Season 10 Special Features (10801/24p except the music video & deleted scenes which are 480i/60) when it jumps to scenes from the earlier years is quiet distinct visually.  The latter lacks sharpest, color clarity/depth even on Blu-ray.    If one were to use Star Trek-The Next Generation as a gauge for a studio going back (18 years in 2012 since it ended in 1994!) and investing the money to re-comp all of the special effects to bring it up to the level of Blu-ray, will I still be around or care in 2029.  If you've been a dedicated fan of Smallville whether recently such as myself or from the very beginning in 2001, either the [[ASIN:B003L77GGA Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray]]] or the complete series should satisfy.  While the ultimate value choice is for each to make, I have no regrets completing my collection even if 5 of the seasons were double dipped as the extras on the [[ASIN:B004XWLN20 Smallville: The Complete Series]] appear to be exceptionally well worth the money spent.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|To praise the edgy, yet often warm, humor and fine writing and acting in \\"Community\\" would be preaching to the converted, at least on the Amazon product listing; so I'm here to comment on the DVDs.  The extras on Community Season One consist of blooper reels, three mini episodes, brief cast interviews, and voice over commentary for every episode.  One episode, \\"Communication Studies\\", is presented in original and extended (by 9 minutes!) versions.  The commentary by the cast members and an assortment of creative and production staff really illuminate some of the more obscure elements of each episode (for example what Abed is doing in the hazy background of an episode from which he is otherwise absent).  In addition, the audio commentary really makes clear that the people who work on this show are as appreciative and passionate about it as are its small (but growing) army of fans.  Loan your copy to friends, it takes more than one episode to win a convert to Greendale Nation!
B0051E9INK|1.0|Watch this for its value as a pop culture classic, but be aware that it is mysogynistic and homophobic, with an awkward, lurching plot, underwhelming action scenes, and exceptionally visible suspension wires.  Does not pass the Bechdel test, though it almost had the opportunity -- the two female characters' lives both revolve around the male lead.  One other female character: the prostitute who shows up at the antagonist's hotel room for the purpose of using \\"kinky\\" as a codeword for evil.  You may find yourself asking questions like, \\"why is that man doing backflips when walking would clearly suffice in this situation?\\" \\"Why isn't that woman calling the police, for whom she works?\\" \\"Why is there crime scene tape but nobody guarding the crime scene?\\" \\"Why aren't they arresting that man for assaulting an officer?\\" \\"Why is Sean Connery claiming to be an Egyptian most recently based out of Spain?\\" \\"Why is he wearing a robe of peacock feathers while riding through the Scottish highlands, and how is it still in one piece? \\"Why does he wear his katana blade-down?\\" \\"Why do they call a blade from before samurai existed a 'samurai sword'?\\"  \\"No, seriously, why hasn't anybody called the police?\\"  There will not be answers to these questions.
0312641893|5.0|OK, ok I gotta calm down before I write this review or it will make no sense. But I must start by saying I wanted to throw this against the wall when I was done and not in \\"I hated it and wasted my time\\", but in a \\"NOOOO it's not done and is leaving me hanging!\\" I really liked this book. It has lots of great elements!The main character is what carries any fairy tale retelling and I really liked Cinder, she was so real and really made the story for me. This book flows so well, the writing is great! The bad guy was nasty and I really couldn't figure out where this book was going and we all know the story, but I promise you will be surprised.I am a lover of fairy-tales and I like sci-fy so this really fell into my category, but I don't think it will matter. I think this book will be excepted and liked by many who might not like one or the other of those things. This book is very clean. There is a kiss and a little violence and a disease that kills people and is described. 12 and up.I will be impatiently waiting for the next book.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|Movie is AMAZING.  So glad I got this.  Since we're not concerned about the UltraViolet bit, the DVD was amazing.  Movie is wonderful.  Really...enough said.

I read somewhere that all eight HP movies will be pulled from shelves after Christmas...until WB decides to release a newer updated version - and who knows when that will be!!
B00004XONN|5.0|When I sat down to listen to the album, Kid A, my Radiohead background consisted of Pablo Honey and The Bends.  It doesn't take very long for any listener to see the strong difference between these two mature, anthemic pop albums and the driving computer and electronically manipulated compositions we find on Kid A.    Kid A was preceded by Radiohead's highly successful album, OK Computer.  It was during touring for this album that Yorke had a mental breakdown and went into depression, possibly laying the foundation for the isolated, cold emotions that would later pour from the tracks of Kid A, particularly \\"How To Disappear Completely.\\"  With OK Computer, the band had established itself as a mainstream pop rock band that could produce sophisticated and worthwhile music in a society that worshipped boy bands and cookie cutter artists.  Some thought they could possibly be the \\"saviors\\" of modern rock.  How do you follow an act like that?   Radiohead's answer, in my opinion, was brilliant.  Kid A is an album that should be tried like a fine wine rather than chugged down like a tasteless light beer.  With a quick first glance, it is easy to miss the real beauty and emotions that the songs can portray and invoke.  The band strayed away from typical verse-bridge-chorus pop songs to experiment with electronically manipulated music that takes advantage of the potential that our evolving technology provides.  As band member Jonny Greenwood says in reference to writing the album, \\"I don't remember much time playing keyboards.  It was more an obsession with sound, speakers, the whole artifice of recording....it was just freeing to discard the notion of acoustic sounds being truer.\\" (wikipedia.org)  Band member Ed O'Brien added, \\"Everything is wide open with the technology now.  The permutations are endless.\\"  (wikipedia.org)  And this is where Kid A is truly a piece of art.    Kid A is an electronically driven album written for and inspired by a quickly advancing world of technology.  These advances provide us endless possibilities yet Yorke's lyrics suggest a consumerist society of drones, slowly depleting the resources of this world.  If we are content with our actions, than this is good enough.  These themes wrap themselves around many of the tracks on the album.  Songs like \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\", \\"Kid A\\", and \\"Morning Bell\\" have eerie, repetitive lyrics where Yorke's voice is seen more as an instrument than the leading piece to the music.  On the album are two instrumentals, \\"Treefingers\\" and the hidden track, \\"Genchildren\\".  \\"Treefingers\\" arrives as an almost peaceful calm of ambient sounds that invokes a deeper sense of isolation and loneliness, an ironic twist of emotions through the lack of vocals and resonating tones.   A large part of this album was possible due to the advancement of technology and its use in the musical world.  Jonny Greenwood expands his musical talents to the Ondes Martenot, an early staple instrument in electronic music, on tracks such as \\"How To Disappear Completely,\\" and \\"The National Anthem.\\"  On many of the songs, Yorke's voice is electronically enhanced and manipulated through computer software.  The repetitive nature familiar with synthesizers and electronic music finds itself in Yorke's lyrics and structure of the songs, like the four-chord progression of \\"Idioteque\\".  Overall, I find the album to be quite a masterpiece.  Radiohead was able to respond to the overwhelming success of OK Computer with a truly artistic album that reached for the resources of a growing underground electronical world and brought and exposed them to the surface of our pop driven society.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|This is the best series on TV. Can't wait until Tuesday night. No one does it better than Jax. What an all star cast! I'll remember this gang no matter where I see them. Whatever season, it always has a great storyline, and it will never leave you disappointed. My favorite was the visit with the Irish.  And I'd love to see Sam Elliott in some kind of biker role. He's the Vietnam Veteran age, could have been friends with John and Piney, he's got that deep voice that makes ya listen, and he looks good in leathers. And if he could play the biker boyfriend of Cher in Mask, he could be Jemma's love interest, and a father figure for Jax! Love this show!!!

If you can read this book from cover to cover without looking up a single word in dictionary, you will do quite well on the verbal part of the SAT.<br /><br />By the way, story is pretty good too. Not the Hollywood version of \\"I have created a monster\\" thrill-ride but a close examination of how we ambitious humans tend to screw things up and in trying to fix it, we screw it up even more.<br /><br />Monster in the book is very eloquent and I got a big kick out of that.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first began this book my initial thought was, \\"So, this is basically Battle Royale but more for females?\\" A friend asked me if that made it better or worse than Battle Royale, which is a novel (not the movie, not the manga, THE NOVEL) that I love almost above all others.  It was not fair for me to assess it at the time, and now it is stuck in comparison-dom, but not as much as I thought it would be.  Same general idea, sure.  But oddly with a less helpless feel to The Hunger Games.  This novel never left me terribly surprised by anything but it left me feeling satisfied.  The story was good, the games were well told, and this novel itself did not try to do more than it had time for.  It simply allowed the story to be told the way it should have.  Katniss, the protagonist, is actually unlikable in a lot of ways, which makes her a more realistic character.  She is a good person caught in a bad situation but she has qualities that make her a more likely candidate to survive a game such as this.    Every character is realistic and they fit in the situation they are thrown in.  While I preferred Battle Royale, it had more emotion and a larger array of characters, I still had to throw this novel five stars because the characters who were chosen for the games were more realistic while still being varied and the plot itself was compelling.  That is not even to speak on the splendorous writing style that had me sitting down and having to finish most of this book in one sitting. I'm not usually that type of reader, even with as much as I read.

B005IS565S|2.0|American Capitalist may still have the overall \\"Death Punch\\"-sound, a fast and furious guitar-laden beat, and there's no denying that Ivan Moody's one of the best vocalists in the metal world today, but the album still falls far short of expectations. The title and the cover artwork speaks volumes about what you're getting; this is no beautiful anthem for the wartorn soldiers ([[ASIN:B002IC1RR8 War Is The Answer]]), no devilishly fun heavy metal outing ([[ASIN:B000SFJWLU The Way of the Fist]]). It's an album about capitalism, fame, sports and..girls? How the mighty have fallen.<br /><br />\\"American Capitalist\\" is FFDP churning out a typical song, groovy, well sung, just heavy enough. The only surprise, again, is the theme. These guys can do better, but off to a decent start.<br /><br />\\"Under And Over It\\" might be the highlight of the album; a freight-train of riffs, it grabs you by the throat, the rhetorical verses build to a soaring chorus. This song sticks.<br /><br />\\"The Pride\\" is a mixture of melody-chanting (odd) and Moody spitting out..trademarks and celebrities? When he then claims to not be \\"selling out\\" but \\"buying in\\", it's tough to take him by the words. Three poor songs rolled into one, not exactly inspired music.<br /><br />\\"Coming Down\\" opens beautifully; haunting guitar-strings and Ivan's tortured voice sets the stage, but then it quickly veers off with the chorus, which has about the oddest melody I've heard, rising in all the wrong places, seeming just plucked from the air and very much out of tune with the rest of the song (which could've been a wonderful subdued affair).<br /><br />\\"Menace\\" is the first FFDP song that I'd refer to as simply \\"bad\\"; the tempo's all over the place, there are no memorable riffs or melodies to speak of, and the vocals sound giddy like a schoolboy's jump-rope song; \\"not trying to be selfish, just doing what I know\\" isn't the lyrical prowess the band have made themselves known for in the past.<br /><br />\\"Generation Dead\\" just makes the grade, but again, the guys sound almost like they've hit auto-pilot, it just trucks along, the chorus is a strong melody, and then the song is over with. An alright mid-tempo song.<br /><br />\\"Back For More\\"..remember four songs ago when they claimed they weren't selling out? Here's a song for the videogame [[ASIN:B003O6EAM6 Madden NFL 12]], about sweating and fighting back and getting back up on the horse (or whatever). Yet again, the song's technically pretty decent, but it doesn't sound like the band are having any fun or doing what they really want to. If nothing else, you could blast this in the gym for laughs.<br /><br />\\"Remember Everything\\" is the band's second attempt at a beautiful melodic power metal-ballad (on this album), and as before, it opens as just that; a powerful testament to their ability to tug at your heartstrings. And then, cue chorus. Suddenly it sounds like they're playing any of a dozen power-pop ballads you'd hear on the radio. Cheesy lyrics? Check. Hitting that pivotal vocal highlight? Check. It could've been great, but rather than feeling \\"from the heart\\" it feels like \\"broaden the demographic\\" and \\"hit the radio airwaves more\\".<br /><br />\\"Wicked Ways\\" shows the same problem, it opens as any FFDP-cruncher (for better or worse, phoning it in), and then they drop a chorus like that on you (\\"You've got an evil wicked way of saying I love you\\"), and I just sit there dumbfounded and wonder if this album was written and co-produced by the pop factory.<br /><br />\\"I'll Fall\\" is also frustrating, but not because it's as bad as the rest, on the contrary! It's one of the few highlights of the album, so much that it feels like a song left over from an earlier album. The opening guitars stroke your ears, the song gains momentum and then hits a homerun with the chorus; just right, powerful without being sappy, melodic without going overboard. A very good song! Moody here uses the melodic wailing as a bridge, not as an opener, andit goes just fine as it only works to strenghten the song and set you up for the chorus again.<br /><br />\\"100 Ways To Hate\\" is the last attempt to pluck out the brass balls and show that they've actually got testosterone, but too little and too late, it just becomes an immature temper tantrum with a waste of decent musicianship, they try so desperately to hammer the point home (\\"yeah, I REALLY hate this guy\\") that it rebounds and for the first time, they just end up kind of annoying. It's an alright tune music-wise, but the lyrics are just too one-note.<br /><br />Five Finger Death Punch are still one of the most promising bands in the current heavy metal world, their debut was strong and has truly grown on me (particularly the 14-track edition), and they outdid themselves with their [[ASIN:B002IC1RR8 sophomore album]], which I consider a masterpiece of sorts. Unfortunately this album is either the biggest prank on all of us, or they've had their heads crammed full of royalty-checks blocking the inspiration, because they've hit their first slump as far as I'm concerned.  Come back soon guys, I for one miss your fantastic music.0 Ways To Hate\\" is the last attempt to pluck out the brass balls and show that they've actually got testosterone, but too little and too late, it just becomes an immature temper tantrum with a waste of decent musicianship, they try so desperately to hammer the point home (\\"yeah, I REALLY hate this guy\\") that it rebounds and for the first time, they just end up kind of annoying.

B00184RQ3Q|1.0|This review is for packaging of Judas Priest - Original Album Classic not the actual music which is 5 star.<br /><br />The concept of putting 5 great albums of one artist together in box set is wonderful idea, in this case for 4 remastered w/ bonus tracks Judas Priest classics -Sin After Sin, British Steel, Turbo and Painkiller plus the Angel of Retribution, the first album with Rob Halford back in the band after a nearly decade long absence.<br /><br />In excution of this, Sony decide to give you the cds in 5 cardboard sleeves (instead the regular plastic cases). Each sleeve has the original front and back covers but that's it. They do not listed the bonus tracks on the sleeves only the slipcase. THERE ARE NO LYRICS, LINER NOTES OR BAND PICTURES included you have to go some website for that!!!!<br />Bare bones products like this should not exist because if you only want the music you might as well download it and if your are music collector like myself the lyrics and liner notes as almost as important as the music itself in the expierence and looking this information up on a website just doesn't do. So be aware of Sony's Original Album Classic series music collectors this are not the music expierence you are looking for.  I thought it was too good to be true and it was.  I should have know better!

B000QCS8TW|2.0|George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series has taken on the status of `Must Read' with the constant critical acclaim, the HBO series, and prime real estate positioning of his books at the local brick and mortar. I succumbed to the marketing pressures and decided to check out what all the fuss was about, so I purchased a copy of \\"A Game of Thrones\\" the first book in the series.<br /><br />\\"A Game of Thrones\\" is founded on a solid base with a medieval type kingdom in turmoil, and all the big players in royal politics end up duking it out when the ascension of the prince to the throne is questioned. As far as fantastic elements, this book does not go over the top, but rather has it layered in nicely with magic not being front in center, but hiding underground with only a couple people with access to it. This makes the book accessible to those who are usually turned off by the elves, dwarfs, and wizards in traditional high fantasy. Martin also paints a very complex and vivid world that includes seasons (like winter or summer) that can last for decades on end as well as tribes of horse-riding warlords with a rich culture.<br /><br />It is also clear that Martin is a master of weaving a complex plot that twists and turns through the lives of a vast array of characters that range in age from about ten to fifty, male and female, and gives the point of view of all sides of the conflict. Further more, each character is well developed to the point where they all have traits that both make them strong and weak at the same time. It's refreshing to see somebody in the fantasy take the time to so diligently flesh out his characters.<br /><br />However, there are too many characters and far too many character viewpoints to really get the reader fully invested in the book. By page 50 of the first book, I had read eight different points of view from different characters scattered across the world without once having the same viewpoint twice. This made it very difficult to get invested in the book when I wasn't sure who the main character was, even though it turns out this book has about eight main characters.<br /><br />And this leads to another problem. With eight points of view and 704 pages, we only get on average 88 pagers per main character. This book was essentially the first quarter of eight separate novels. For most novels, it usually takes about 75 to 100 pages for the first major plot point to hit and the story begins, and each of these separate story lines is no exception. This makes the book then lack much of a (or any) story arc for many of the characters as the journey has just really begun.<br /><br />As a result, most of the characters undergo little or no change, and the plot really becomes almost like a listening to a history lecture (This book is said to be loosely based on the War of the Roses.) from an eloquent professor. It has it's entertaining moments and there are a couple times when I found myself wanting to read another couple pages before I went to sleep because the story drew me in, but for the most part I kept going only because I wanted to get to the point where the story became good enough for an HBO series, but that never came.<br /><br />Perhaps in book 2 or 3 or 4 it gets good, but I will probably not read those. While each of the 8 separate stories started out fine, that's about all they managed to do. Martin just proved to me he knows how to open a novel 8 times and not that he can finish one. I for one and not about to read another 2600 pages to find out if his epic is going anywhere, and I do not recommend you invest your time in this book.<br /><br />\\"The Game of Thrones\\" receives 2 out of 5 stars.wasn't sure who the main character was, even though it turns out this book has about eight main characters.

Steve is on fire all night, Chris' supporting vocals are fantastic, and Alan has a show stopping drum solo in Astral Traveller, which is model of percussive creativity and economy.<br /><br />Benoit David and Oliver Wakeman have taken some hits from long-term fans, but this line-up really comes through with these tracks.  The band sounds energetic, cohesive, and the musical sparks are flying throughout.  The tempos are a tad slower, but the sound is expansive and powerful.  Machine Messiah is a knockout, maestro Steve Howe's Corkscrew is an absolute gem, and Roger Dean's artwork make this the best Yes package since Yessongs.

1451627289|2.0|This is a well written suspense thriller. However, King needed to do a much better job of research. His cited sources, in his afterword, are very poor. For example, Posner's \\"Case Closed\\" is a totally ridiculous rehash of the Warren Commission report. Posner himself told Mark Lane (as quoted in \\"The Last Word\\") that if Mark Lane had defended Oswald in a trial, Oswald would have been acquitted! The evidence clearly proves Oswald did not shoot anyone. The Zapruder film is a fake. Eyewitnesses, to the Walker attempt and the Tippet shooting, described the shooters as having a totally different description from Oswald. There is much more such evidence.  King's portrayal of Oswald is based on the Warren Commission Report lies. Also, there are other inaccuracies. For example, the Dallas Texans never became the Dallas Cowboys. The Dallas Texans became the Kansas City Chiefs. You cannot smell fumes from Midland - Odessa in Dallas because Dallas is quite a distance from them. If you are looking for a good read which has extremely little historical truth, then you might like it. I was disappointed in the distorted presentation of historical facts. King even states that he is 98% sure Oswald did it alone. Unfortunately, King is 98% wrong. Finally, this book is laced with unnecessary profanity.

B000002HIK|5.0|I Care Because You Do is Richard D. James', also known as Aphex Twin, third studio album.  Often regarded as one of his best albums, I Care Because You Do was released in April 1995.  This album pairs many of the musical styles James previously utilized in previous albums. Both of his earlier studio albums, Selected Ambient Works 85-82 and Selected Ambient Works Volume II, as their titles suggest focused on ambient music styles. In many ways, James was a pioneer in the field expanding on the work of Brian Eno. His third album however, pairs his expertise in the ambient style with other trends in electronic music. For this album, James makes heavy use of analogue synthesizers as well as drum loops creating a completely unique soundscape in comparison to his previous albums and EPs. Some tracks also utilize string instruments to give the album an element of classical texture as well. One of the most interesting aspects of the album is the fact that it touches upon such a variety of textures and techniques. Even within one song, James is able to move seamlessly between soft and harsh, light and dark. In many ways he pushes the boundaries of such electronic albums. One of the highlights of the album is the track entitled Ventolin. This song was used in a promotional video for the album and features an extremely harsh frequency throughout. It's interesting because it evokes such a strong response from the listener utilizing such a high pitch. The rhythm of the rest of the song is constantly punctuated by this overarching higher frequency that creates a unique image in the listener's head without any lyrical content. Another track entitled, Cow Cud is a Twin, clearly utilizes some type of computer program that speaks and repeats the words \\"Aphex Twin\\" over and over. This trend of utilizing computer programming in the creation of electronic music is a trend present through much of recent technosonic history.  Finally, the last track entitled Next Heap With, utilizes the classical elements of string instruments paired with electronic frequencies to create a captivating finale to the album.    The structure of the album is complete in ways other than just the musical content as well. The cover of the album is an almost frightening picture of the artist's own face. Its slight distortion would become characteristic for many of James' future album such as the cover of Richard D. James Album. It even would show up in some of his future music videos for songs like Windowlicker. Within the album itself even the track names are related to one another. Some of the tracks are anagrams for things the artists pseudonym. For example, the track entitled Wax the Nip is an anagram of Aphex Twin. The tracks entitled The Waxen Pith, Wet Tip Hen Ax, and Next Heap With, are all anagrams of The Aphex Twin. It is very clear how much of James himself went into the creation of this album and this is perhaps why it is so successful in accomplishing its goals of enticing listeners throughout the entire album rather than just one song.
1400031524|4.0|After reading a feature article in Entertainment Weekly about this author a few months back (after publication of his last in the Kurt Wallander series), I was intrigued.  So I picked up \\"Faceless Killers\\" (the first in the series) and quickly devoured it.  It's a solid 4-star debut from this interesting and talented writer.  Definitely a different kind of writer, and Wallander is a different kind of police detective.  Given that these books are a translation from Swedish, there are some awkward passages in the novels.  However, overall the brilliant pacing and characterization of Mankell shines through from page to page, and I really loved \\"Faceless Killers\\".  This (\\"The Dogs of Riga\\"), the second in the Wallander series, is not quite as... I don't know what the right word is... it's not quite as polished in some ways, and it didn't feel as realistic.  It seemed over-the-top and unbelievable at times in its depiction of the strange world that Wallander falls into (a la Alice in Wonderland) in Latvia.  And a bit implausible, to say the least, that Wallander would be so captured by the widow of the slain Latvian major, and so desperate, that he would willingly return to Latvia for what turns out to be a stunning if (again) rather implausible climax.  Nonetheless, I will pick up at least one or two more books in the Wallander series, because there's something about Mankell's writing -- how he paces the plots and unfolds the story, how he depicts the harsh Swedish landscape as well as the tormented inner landscape and essential humanity of the protagonist (a very flawed, yet likable character is this middle-aged Swedish policeman) -- that leaves an indelible impression on me.  Perhaps it's because I can relate so closely to the flawed character and psychological turmoil of Kurt Wallander?  Anyway, the bottom line is that this may not prove to be anywhere near the best in the Wallander series, but it's still an interesting and satisfying read... If you like well-craftedmurder mysteries set in a foreign land with compelling characters, you could do much much worse!

Also there were nice description on how to prevent common mistakes.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I love this movie, so glad to have it in blu-ray!! My daughter and I enjoy watching al the Disney movies together!
B0029LHWFO|4.0|The book has been very interesting and informative.  It provides a good insight into President Obama's early life.  His mother and his grandparents were a very positive influence.
0439023513|3.0|I was at the airport and randomly had picked up The Hunger Games and was immedately caught by the fast paced and gripping story.  I finished the first book in about a day and ordered the next two off of Amazon right away when I returned home.  While I enjoyed Catching Fire, MockingJay left some things to be desired.  It felt like the author was trying to finish the storyline for the sakes of finishing and it simply didn't feel as well put together as teh first two.  The ending was specifically disapointing, without spoiling it, it simply didn't feel like the culimination it should have been.  I recommend this book for the sakes of finishing the storyline but not on the merits of it's standalone execution.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|Fantastic ending to a compelling story. Best movie for special effects in combination with magical enchantment and a favorite of the Harry Potter collection.
B004XWLN20|5.0|This is a well-made dvd set of a spectacular series that deserves blu-ray quality.<br /><br />Which leaves me to wonder who exactly this 10 season dvd set is for. A casually interested person would not spend $200, they'd be better served to pick up a couple seasons at walmart for $15 each. Yet a longtime fan wants a beautifully made blu-ray set of all 10 seasons.<br /><br />Everyone can identify with this series in some way. Whether it's a glimpse of high school days, the struggles of being a parent, life's moral dilemmas, or the sheer love of a good story. I have had the first 4 seasons on dvd, got the 7th on blu-ray for christmas, and never missed an episode the whole decade it's aired. So please, take my advice as a longtime fan and wait for the Blu-ray release. You won't regret it!
B000KE5JNE|2.0|I tried to watch this series, but could not get past the first episode.  I found the acting to be quite contrived (that is the point in the novel) but I could not get past the shallow characters.  Maybe fans of the novel would fare better.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game looks great and works well on the Kindle Fire. I was truly impressed although this is my first real android device so... Anyway I keep reading people saying that they cant find good, free apps for the fire. perhaps, they are looking only for ones with fire in the title or in the kindle store instead of the app store. If you love mahjong and are looking for free apps, give this one a try.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|Aun recuerdo cuando compré el Lp The Joshua Tree, me pareció un disco que lo tenia todo, pero luego vino el CD y el audio incomparable al cual escuche un millón de veces, pero ahora tengo el The Joshua Tree Remasterizado y Super Deluxe, con un bonus disc y un DVD con el concierto en Paris, junto con las postales y el libro con la letra y comentarios del grupo, en una caja de lujo, realmente vale oro. lo recomiendo!!!
1594744769|3.0|This book is alright.  The premise is interesting especially with the inclusion of the pictures, though it still left something to be desired.  I don't know if the characters were as developed as I'd like and the plot was at times predicable, but for a general YA book, it's pretty good.
B00000JSJC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie when I first saw it and after watching it again I see why. This is a very cool movie with a great cast and insane plot that was unheard of at the time. This was a peek into the future from back in the 1990's. The story revolves around the millennium party happening on New Year's eve in 1999. Plenty of action and shoot outs along with a deranged serial killer. This is a film that explores the scenery and characters from very odd and interesting perspective visually. Some of the things we see in this movie have actually come to fruition. Creepy! Fun movie to check out and I recommend this specifically for Blade Runner fans.
0553801473|2.0|Alright, I breezed through books 1-3, hit a big slump in 4 and had to force my way through it and was convinced that this latest one would erase the displeasure of book 4 only to find it worse.  I have to say this is the last one I will read (actually stopped on page 444).  To many times these writers finally \\"hit big\\" and sell out.  Same thing with Craig Johnson, first several books were great then \\"Whammy\\", movie/series money comes into play and the creativity ceases. Don't understand how folks can give this 5 stars unless they are totally masochistic.  I believe good old George started out solid, but has waned considerably.  Save your money for a worthwhile movie (heard the muppet movie was good)  Kevin
B002JTHFUS|5.0|Al igual que Joshua Tree version Deluxe, The Unforgettable Fire es y ha sido el mejor album de U2 para mi, y tenerlo en esta presentacion de lujo junto con un bonus CD y el DVD son invalorables, a parte viene con postales del grupo y un libro con todo el detalle del disco realmente es para coleccionistas, vale la pena el precio que le pongan
B005CGI4EG|4.0|Just got this in the mail (got it for less than $100 too), and being a big MWC fan, I love it. All the eps are there including the controversial \\"her cups runneth over\\" that got terry ricolta trying to get the show banned (and ultimately made it more popular) as well as the lost episode \\"I'll See You In Court\\". All the eps seem to have the extended intro w/out the famous sinatra intro, that I guess was created just for TV to keep it short.It also has a few married w/ children specials on there, including one where the cast talked about their favorite episodes. Though this one was taped while the show was still on the air....the set does not seem to include the later reunion special from 2003.    On the whole this is a great collection only real downside was the odd way they packaged the disks. Since there were a lot of them I guess they just saved a lot on package design/manufacturing by having all the discs lumped together in two deep plastic spools/wells w/ 16 discs on each one. They are in order however it's basically up to you to keep them that way. From what I understand this is different from the other release of this in 2010 just cause they wanted to redo the packaging like this to make it more affordable. (I'm not sure what the other one looks like though) other than that I've heard it's the EXACT SAME CONTENT as the other one.    Anyway to continue.....while they are all lumped together the discs are well marked and the designs are all different depending on what season is on them. Each season is usually 3 discs and the discs will say something like \\"Disc 2: The Complete Fifth Season\\" in a very obvious/easy to see way. So if you get them mixed up it won't take you long to organize them better. Other than the few problems the packaging gives you, a great series of course and a must own for any MWC fan
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I got a little worried about ordering this cover after reading the reviews.  Well, I got it today and am very happy with it - it's just what I was looking for.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I think it's overpriced, even at $29.
B005K2XM94|2.0|I purchased a Timbuk2 plush sleeve for my kindle keyboard a couple months ago and I LOVED it.  It had memory foam padding and the kindle felt secure inside it.  I purchased THIS sleeve for my kindle fire and was extremely disappointed that it didn't have the foam of the plush.  Its just a sleeve of very thin material and there is a lot of extra room inside the sleeve so when I shake it, the kindle moves around inside. There is no foam or any kind of protection if the kindle were to be dropped.  It was only $10 less than the plush version so I should have bought that.  The difference between these two sleeves is immense.
B005NA3B8U|3.0|I would give it 5 stars if not for the fact that my thumb or forfinger has to be on the screen and provide nice  hiding places for those kamikazi enemies. This is not the kind of game that gives you much room for error so timing and positioning are critical. I love all the other aspects of the port however. I guess I' ll look for a PC or PS3 version because I've always loved this game. Thanks for the effort.
B00005K9LM|1.0|This is the worst remaster I have ever heard and it's a shame because I loved this album. There is no ther way to hear it either, unless you have the original vinyl and a good turntable. The remaster sounds like a cassette tape that was recorded to loud. It's distorted! I ripped it into my .wav editor and couldn't believe my eyes. Instead of seeing the peaks and valleys that a good .wav is supposed to have, this thing was all over-peak! I could have done a better job. Remaster does not always mean better. Metallica's first 3 cd's are lower in volume than other cd's for a reason: clarity! All you have to do is turn up your stereo. I'd say do not buy, but if you want the music I see no other choice, unless you hunt down the Japanese Digi-pack, which I have not heard but I have yet to hear a negative review on one of those. Love Bites! So does this mix!
B005HSL626|5.0|fun game to play while waiting on appointments or such. only problem I've found on the kindle fire is their so-called rewards program. I have reached the 5000 level several times but the kindle fire always says the app cannot connect to the app store...even though that's where I'm downloading from.
0439813786|5.0|This is a wonderfully crafted book full of beautiful illustrations, a unique story-telling style and a magical and truly moving plot. Don't be put off by the size of it (it is immense by young adult book standards) as you will fly through this page-turner at break-neck speed.  I'm not going to ruin the book for anyone by elaborating on the plot-line. I just heartily recommend The Invention of Hugo Cabret to all, young and old alike.
B000E9910W|5.0|While I am not a particularly big fan of the music of the 1970's one group that stood head and shoulders above the rest was The Doobie Brothers.  Led by vocalist Tom Johnston, this group successfully combined elements of rock 'n roll and R&B and made some of the most memorable music of the decade.  And despite a rash of personnel changes along the way the group continued to make great music throughout the 1970's. All of this great music is now available on Rhino's terrific two-disc compilation \\"The Very Best of The Doobie Brothers\\". This is a superb collection of one of America's greatest rock and roll bands.<br /><br />It did not take long for the group to make its mark on the American music scene.  Formed in San Jose, Ca. in 1970, The Doobies found themselves riding high on the Billboard Top Pop Singles Chart when in the fall of 1972 their debut release \\"Listen To The Music\\" leaped all the way to #11.  Quite an accomplishment!  Over the next few years, in the waning days of Top 40 radio on the AM dial, the hits just kept on comin' with memorable songs like \\"Long Train Runnin'\\", \\"Black Water\\" and \\"China Grove\\".  Meanwhile, The Doobie Brothers were also making their mark on the FM side. The album-oriented rock (AOR) format was just gaining traction in the early to mid 70's and Doobie's tunes were prominently featured in that format as well. What I particularly enjoyed about The Doobie Brothers was that no two songs seemed to sound alike.  This was a very innovative group that featured tight harmonies and superior musicianship.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier the group was plagued by constant personnel changes which made the fact that their music was so consistantly good all the more remarkable.  In 1975, Michael McDonald came aboard to replace Tom Johnston and lent his considerable talents to the group.  But the group had a lot of trouble coming up with another big hit. \\"Takin' It To The Streets\\" and \\"It Keeps You Runnin'\\" were great records but it seemed the public had lost some interest.  In late 1978 the group released the album \\"Minute By Minute\\".  This record was greeted with wild enthusiasm by the public.  Not only did it reach #1 on the Billboard Albums chart, but it stayed there for five weeks. \\"Minute By Minute\\" also spawned the #1 single \\"What A Fool Believes\\" which in my opinion would rank among the best singles of the 1970's.  The group continued to have varying amounts of success until they finally disbanded in 1983.  The Doobie Brothers re-formed briefly with Tom Johnston back at the helm and released the great Top 10 single \\"The Doctor\\" which thankfully Rhino has chosen to include in this collection.<br /><br />Featuring a total of 33 tracks on 2 discs, \\"The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers\\" is a compehensive anthology of the band's biggest and best radio hits. These are all the original hit singles you would remember from the radio. Virtually every one of the 27 singles that hit the Billboard Hot 100 are included here.  In addition, what distinguishes this 2006 two-disc set from Rhino's previous single disc compilation is the inclusion of a handful of the most memorable tracks from The Doobie Brothers eight Top Ten albums of the 1970s.  Great stuff! As usual, Rhino has also provided an attractive booklet which details all of the twists and turns that took place in the life of this marvelous group.  \\"The Very Best of The Doobie Brothers\\" should be considered essential to any serious collection of American rock and roll. Very highly recommended!interest.  In late 1978 the group released the album \\"Minute By Minute\\".  This record was greeted with wild enthusiasm by the public.

1451627289|3.0|I recently read this back to back with \\"Carrie\\", King's first novel, published way back in the year I was born. What is left to say about this guy? He knows how to tell a story, and he's probably never going to stop doing exactly that - telling stories. 11/22/63 is a slightly better-than-average 'late' Stephen King novel, which is ostensibly about time travel and politics but really, like all of his books, is about love, memory and loss. And the fact that he's a typical neurotic Virgo, who's worried about his sanity out of all proportion. You already know whether you like his style or not. 11/22/63 isn't essential, but is worth a read if you're still a 'constant reader'.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I saw the movie trailer for \\"War Horse\\" coming out on Christmas day and just had to read this book.  I was not disappointed.  The story is told thru the eyes of Joey the horse as he's taken to the trenches to fight during World War I and his trials and tribulations as he longs to return home to his owner.<br /><br />Highly recommended for readers of any age and I can't wait to see the movie.
098357670X|5.0|Tom Richmond's The MAD Art of Caricature is an instant classic of instructional drawing books. In addition to being just plain gorgeous to look at, it packs 30+ years or so of blood sweat and cartoons into its educational and entertaining pages.  Inside you will find practical and easy to use tips to help any artist advance in their skillset. All in all, a great read that is worth revisiting constantly, perfect for the professional or aspiring artist.
B001E75QGG|2.0|i wanted to like this movie having been a fan of the series since i saw the original 20+ years ago.  in a way, i sort of did like it.  harrison ford's acting was decent though although in general the dialogue just seemed like it was awkwardly written.  most of the rest of the supporting cast was acceptable also, although they were not very impressive or really memorable at all compared to the nazis in the old movies.  the shia le bouf guy is such a crappy and supremely annoying actor here that i have to wonder if the movie would have seemed alot better with practically anyone else playing his role, maybe just pick someone randomly off the street for the sequel? spoiler alert.  the business with Jones surviving the nuclear blast by hiding inside a refrigerator was so implausible that it made suspension of disbelief almost impossible after that point.  as a result, combined with the terrible sidekick acting, Im not sure i can really reccommend this movie.  it might be worth seeing if your a fan of the genre just so you be amazed by how annoying Indiana Jones can become just from the guy they picked to play his son.  but otherwise, its probably not worth your time.  just get raiders of the lost ark instead and be amazed at the kind of movie you can make without computer effects...  and without weasely little jerk guys that look so smug you just want to punch them in the face =P
B005RUV714|5.0|I've seen some reviews of people complaining that the show is too much like a soap opera or that the second season has become boring. Just because the show doesn't have the characters fighting zombies constantly and excessive gore every step of the way, doesn't make it weak or boring. Perhaps people want the series to be like a gore filled horror movie with constant shows of spectacle. If I wanted to watch a bunch of spectacle then I would go just watch a fireworks show. And spectacle is one of the weakest elements of storytelling. It's cheap and meaningless. Finally there's a show that has the guts to explore the human side of how characters would react to a world like this. I'm glad the shows producers and writers haven't ruined the show by making it just another constant zombie chase and gore fest.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I purchased this warily after hearing about the case's supposed problems, and how it felt cheap or that it fell down, but after reading a couple 5 star reviews, I decided to get one. I'm glad that I did.  It's a very nice, very light cover for my somewhat heavy kindle. I feel no added weight.  The edges of the cover do protrude out a little, but they do not hurt, or irritate me at all. I can not see how some other reviewers find it painful.  Some people had problems with the built in stand staying up after a small bump from behind.  Believe it or not, I actually find it useful.  When I'm done watching a movie or a TV show I just tap the back, and down it goes.  I don't have to worry about damaging it while I do that because of the case is very protective.  The edges are all covered, not to mention the back.  It looks as though it could take a beating.  The strap seems secure, but only time will tell.  It might just come out, but it's easily fixable, so I don't worry about it at all.  All in all I'm very glad I bought this, and will continue to use it until I've just about killed my kindle, or until I've just about killed the case.

B005N0C0JQ|5.0|For Americans who have not been paying attention to Noel Gallagher-related music (Oasis) since the heyday of the 1990s, now is a great time to listen again. With this album, Noel Gallagher has delivered a heartfelt, well-produced pop-rock album, packed with great melodies and interesting music. Most of the professional reviews of Noel Gallagher's first solo album spend too much time writing about the interesting backstory (and the whole Liam vs. Noel thing), which I find a bit unfortunate as it overshadows the great music here.   There's a variety of quality songs here, each reflecting Noel's melodic gifts. A few of the songs go for the epic feel of classic Oasis tunes [Everybody's on the Run,(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine and Stop the Clocks], except with strings and choir instead of electric guitar. On paper that sounds pretty silly, but it actually works, once you get used to it. A few other songs have an interesting Kinks influence [The Death of You and Me, Dream On, Soldier Boys and Jesus Freaks]. There's even a good ballad, If I Had a Gun, and a good quasi-dance tune, AKA What a Life! The music generally sounds something like a cross between The Importance of Being Idle, Falling Down and Part of the Queue from the last couple of Oasis albums. I am not a big fan of horns, but the modest use of them on this album works nicely.   Noel's voice sounds great through-out. I've always been partial to singers who actually write their own lyrics as they can often give the songs emotion and meaning that a more technically proficient singer might miss. The tone of the album is generally uplifting with a large dose of melancholy, reflecting Noel's vocal and lyrical style. The lyrics, while sometimes not Noel's strongest point, are generally good here. Even when the words are somewhat silly (as on Dream On), Noel's delivery, along with the music, make that silliness fun, not cringe-inducing.   Noel has even managed to leave a few of the more interesting songs off of the album - check out Let the Lord Shine a Light on Me, A Simple Game of Genius and Alone on the Rope on YouTube or elsewhere (such as the Deluxe version or Itunes version of the album). In particular, Alone on the Rope is a classic that should be on the album somewhere.   Some may not be satisfied with this album because it does not \\"rock\\" or they might miss Liam's voice. True, there are only two guitar solos on the album, and the ending of Stop of the Clocks is about the only time the band cuts loose. And while I like the production, I still enjoy the more stripped down demo version of Record Machine (again check Youtube) with its great baseline and more raw guitar solo. Still, this album is the most consistent set of Gallagher-penned tunes since Oasis' commercial peak, What's the Story (Morning Glory), though it does not rise to the heights of that album.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I saw this movie on the release date in the US and on the plane over to Paris this past September twice. I LOVE EVERY SECOND. The opening is overwhelming lovely, and if you love Paris, it could make your heart skip a beat! I am waiting to have a copy at home to watch whenever I like. The entire movie is a gem. When my wife actually got to Paris, she felt like she was in the movie as I could take her to almost every location in the film. Woody you really hit a grand slam with this one!!!!  Paris is the most beautiful city on this planet and when I can't be there in the flesh, this movie will keep the romance alive for me.  A++
B005G4TJI4|4.0|Great movie but no special features on it.  Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features.

B004UUKDNA|5.0|The LA band's debut album is a spectacular surprise using a right mix of traditional rock instruments with electronic music. The song \\"Houdini\\" uses an array effects coming from all directions, providing surround sound for the listener. \\"Houdini\\" starts off with the drums providing the backbeat to the song, while effect-ridden sounds using electronic synthesizers provide the melody of the song. The intro consists of a centered synthesized melody and a variety of electronic effects. There are three synthesized sounds of the intro melody repeated over, where each provides a distinct aspect to the overall melody. The intro melody provides the perfect introduction to this electronic-indie pop piece. In addition, the transition between the three sounds is so sublime that the listener is effortlessly eased through the melodic phrase. The band uses the Akai Pro MPK61 performance keyboard controller to produce a variety of these electronic effects.   The main focus of the verse is the piano work of Mark Foster and the deep drumbeat in the background. However, there are pockets of electronic sounds that interject perfectly in between the interplay of the piano and the drums. The pre-chorus uses one of the intro melody sounds with another sound from the intro melody layered on top at a different timing. Also, the use of auxiliary effects outside of the melodic effects is varying from pre-chorus to pre-chorus. The chorus bombs the listener with a psychedelic melody consisting of one type electronic effect. The psychedelic, electronic melody takes center stage, while the piano, drums, and brass instruments provide the background harmony of the chorus. The mix of traditional instruments and electronic effects creates a pleasant endless array of different sounds.   The vocals of Foster the People also add to the psychedelic indie-electronic vibe of the song. The falsetto vocals of the pre-chorus provide a ghostly and psychedelic effect, adding to the electronic effects provided by the synthesizers. \\"Houdini\\" is a remarkable musical display of a variety of electronic effects bombarding the listener.   Another song that jumps out of this album is \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\", a simplistic, upbeat piece. The drums and the bass provide the backbone of the song. The synthesized electronic effect Foster the People uses sounds like a squeezing a rubber duck or a wimpy horn sounding. Throughout the chorus, the synthesized phrase is looped. The deep bass sounds are provided by the bass guitar and the drums, while the higher sounds are from the synthesizer effect and the falsetto voice of Mark Foster. In addition, the vocals are made to sound as though it is coming through an old-fashioned radio/stereo system. In one part of the song, the band uses a device to create an echo/reverb vocal. In addition, an echo/reverb effect is used for the guitar parts. It is brilliant display of the effect electronic music can have, even if it is only a looped single phrase. Overall, the song is a catchy indie-pop song with subtle influences from electronic music.   \\"Call It What You Want\\" is fast paced, upbeat song that throws in interesting, organized granular effects with slightly drawn out psychedelic sounds. The beginning is a phrase resembling the sounds of navy shipyard electronic style. Throughout the song, psychedelic sounds that could be described as slippery and eerily smooth. It is as though the song takes the listener through a psychedelic laser show mixed with the brilliant styling of melodic piano work and the driving beats of the bass and drums. All in all, the Torches album is surely a highlight of this year's music releases.
1594744769|5.0|I actually picked up this book for my 14-year-old granddaughter to read for a school project. It looked very interesting, and she got through it fairly fast and did a book report for her class. I asked her to give it to me to read when she was finished, as I had never seen a book with photographs like this before and I wanted to read it. It was definitely worth the wait!   This was a very clever book with an incredibly woven story to go with the photographs. I was thinking as I read it, how wonderful if someone could bring it to film and remain very true to the whole book/story...it would be great. This is the kind of story I remember when I was growing up, I'd be at my grandfather's house (he was an artist) and I'd be making storyboards on his artist's easel...and I'd be coming up with monster stories along the line of something like these hollowgasts. The idea of the peculiar children (who are what people in other times referred to as freaks) who somehow were able to harness time in order to avoid aging and their enemies, draws readers in (even older readers who remember what it was like as children and teens being fascinated by these same ideas). The photographs help to lay the groundwork for the stories that Jacob hears from his grandfather, Abe Portman. And this book wouldn't be near as fascinating without the wonderful black and white photographs that were done for the book.   It would be great to see more books done along this line. I'm not sure I'd want to see a series done along this line of this book. I think this book stands well on its own. But I'd sure like to see some more fantasy books like this done with the photographs if they were done as well as this one was.
B005KGPC4S|1.0|I suppose this is how the world looks to an egotistical stoner of limited education.<br /><br />That's the only way to explain RED STATE, the latest film from Kevin Smith.  A film we won't be seeing at a theatre near you.  A film that doesn't have one believable scene in it.  A film without a single sympathetic character in situations where we might care whether they survive or not.<br /><br />By calling his film RED STATE and focusing on a sect of religious lunatics, Smith is clearly pandering to the political landscape of Hollywood, picking on the rubes and playing every stereotype he can exploit.  But his writing is still limited and juvenile.  Seasoned FBI Agents talk with the same uneducated dialogue as the stupid, horny teenagers.  Religious zealots end up cursing like stupid, horny teenagers.  In fact, everyone, as usual, ends up talking like Kevin Smith...or how he thinks they should talk while saddled with the vocabulary and thought processess of stupid, horny teenagers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Smith ends up equating the FBI with the religious fanatics.  Does Smith honestly believe that phone calls are made from Washington telling Field Agents to slaughter everyone at a hostage situation, including women and children, just to keep things quiet?  What a muddled mess of legal procedures clutter the second half of this movie!<br /><br />Before watching this film tonight, I saw an article in the press where Smith trashed the Independent Spirit Awards in a profanity-laced tirade via Twitter because RED STATE wasn't nominated for anything.  I'm guessing he's the only one surprised by this.<br /><br />Never before have I seen someone go so far on so little and still have a career.  And RED STATE will probably never make it out of the red.  Awful.
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|very good album. The song Black sticks out the most. The production by Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi is really top notch
B0012CH350|1.0|I, too, bought the Weber 18.5\\" smoker and saw that this cover was also suggested with purchase.  I found this misleading and bought both the smoker and this cover together.  When I looked at my order shortly after placing it, I noticed that the smoker comes with a cover and this one isn't needed.  Luckily, I could delete this item from my order, so I won't have an extra cover coming with my smoker.  Amazon, I understand that suggesting other items purchased is a good idea (something that I have benefitted from more than once), but this item doesn't really even match the smoker.  It will cover it well from what I understand, but it is really used for a grill, not a smoker.
B0043URV5U|4.0|This is an excellent 2 disc set...I have greatest hits 1 and 2...The mastering on greatest hits 1 is awful at best...GH 2 is very well done...with this set you get the best...2 major songs missing though...\\"The Fire Inside\\" and \\"Understanding\\".....this could have very easily been a triple disc set...and to be honest...should have been...but hey I can live with this...I just hope Bob goes back to the studio and does another album again very soon.

B0000046KM|5.0|I remember seeing a full page ad in Billboard...that had Shirley's picture on it, circa 1992 (the same picture as this album) and it read as follows:  &quot;If you LOVED &quot;Unforgettable,&quot; you will LOVE &quot;Here's to Life!&quot;  Okay.  So I just kept flipping through the magazine wondering to myself who Shirley Horn even WAS.  I honestly had never heard of her.<br /><br />A few weeks later, I was home sick from work with the flu and my other 1/2 (at that time) gave me &quot;Here's to Life&quot; for Valentine's Day, 1992.  I was in a complete Nyquil fog, but managed to get up from off the couch, pop the CD in and lie there listening.  At first, I thought to myself, &quot;YIKES!  Her voice is really DEEP!&quot;  Then I thought to myself, &quot;...and the songs are REALLY slow.&quot;  I kept listening until I got to the last cut, &quot;Estate,&quot; and that's when I recall the magic happening.  The TRUE connection, the SOUL connection.  I programmed that track on REPEAT and it must have played at LEAST another 25x before I fell asleep and woke up to it a few hours later.  The tenderness with which she infused each song was incomparable.  The &quot;deep&quot; voice suddenly lost its &quot;deepness&quot; and became &quot;tender and romantic.&quot;  I was under her spell.  After that, I was hooked on &quot;How Am I To Know,&quot; &quot;Isn't It A Pity,&quot; &quot;If You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Wild Is The Wind.&quot;<br /><br />About a week later after I returned to work feeling better, I began buying each one of her many albums over the course of 3 months.  I now own every CD she's ever released and had the honor of seeing her live in concert twice.  The first time, I got to go backstage to actually meet her.  She quietly studied me in my leather biker jacket (and tie) as if to say, &quot;This 30-something thug actually loves my music???&quot;  Incidentally, she must have had the flu herself because her table was cluttered with empty Robitussen bottles and an ashtray overflowing with lipstick-encircled Pall Mall Red unfiltered cigarettes!  LOL! The second time, I got to give her a hug and a kiss in exchange for another autograph. (The first time I saw and met her, she autographed my &quot;Loving You&quot; CD and the second time, my &quot;Here's To Life&quot; CD.)  She didn't have the flu THAT time thankfully.  She was in good health, but required assistance in getting up onto the stage; most likely due to age and her struggle with diabetes.  A fan was also sweet enough to have baked her (Shirley) a &quot;Here's To Life&quot; cake with a very lifelike Shirley Horn face (as the photograph on the front of the CD) made out of rich, buttercream frosting!  :-)<br /><br />Shirley's voice continues to warm my heart and whenever I hear this album, I'm reminded of how blessed I was to have received it with love so that I would come to know the most talented, most gifted singer/player of songs on the face of this planet.  She was classy, warm and absolutely enchanting and I will never forget one of the most &quot;starstruck&quot; nights of my entire life.  I nearly floated home after the show!<br /><br />Long live the legacy of Shirley Horn and God bless her family always.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I normally do not read King's books but the thought of going back into time to change a significant event sucked me in and i wasn't disappointed at all. It took a little while for me to get into but i think that has more to do with the fact i don't normally read these type of books but once the substance of the book started i could not put it down. I am impressed with the details and the fact he actually tried to be realistic in his facts and also it was nice to have a side story to go along with it!
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|Super 8 is much better when it delivers a coming of age story/drama, character developement and tearjerker than when it delivers the sci-fi/action & adventure elements to the film. The acting was very impressive in this film from all of the mostly unknown child actors with Elle Fanning in her best role to date next to Phoebe In Wonderland and it's amazing to me that this thirteen year old graces the screen effortlessly like she is a verteran actress, it's uncanny. The story of forgiveness and letting go overpowers most of the action scenes especially the ending which may bring some viewers to tears and the natural bond between the kids reminded me of classic films like Stand By Me and The Goonies with a dash of Signs, Monsters and E.T. and is mostly like those films than being a full blown thrilling and terrifying sci-fi/action flick and to be honest this is just a retro family film than what trailers lead you to believe. There were a couple of plot holes that bothered me like where did all the missing dogs go? How did the monster get there in the first place and are there more? Was is just a mad science experiment gone wrong? Ect. When it actually shows the monster it wasn't scary enough and went the King Kong route and made it have feelings which was a tad cheesy and what I'm trying to say is that it didn't go horror enough with not enough terror and suspense for a monster movie or whatever it was aiming for which I still don't know because it tried to juggle a bunch of genres at once which in the end kind of played against it and became less effective as it moves along. I liked how it was paying tribute to all of the classic movies of it's kind of that decade but mabey a little too much because alll it does is make you rememeber the good old days of the movies that you longed for that it tries so hard to become that it doesn't focus enough on becoming it's own movie which sooner or later will be forgotten.
B005DOKM9M|2.0|I am an amazon believer. I think they are great.<br />I have been a customer for a long time and purchased many items from them. I totally have always been satisfied with quality and price.<br />Now let me get to this product. It is overpriced and poor quality. Some rightly stated it should be sold in a dollar store.<br />At $10 top price.  I still wouldn't be satisfied.<br />As far as the odor is concerned, I was a chemist and the odor indicates inexpensive (cheap) coating formulas. Cheap chemicals don't often meet industry standards.  China has no industry standards unless the importer requires and states the compliance standards. I would return it but I threw out the packaging. China has been challenged when it comes to products for children using toxic materials. Do you remember all the sheet rock panels were contaminated with formaldahyde which was not only toxic but would corrode wires and boxes in the areas of placement.<br />It was a diaster waiting to happen. Toxic loaded paint on childrens toys.<br />I could go on and on but I can't totally blame amazon But it would be interesting to see what their reaction is?<br />If nobody watches the store where are we going to wind up?<br />On a technical point all chemicals in plastics migrate out in time.

0312641893|4.0|A strong female lead in a dystopian young adult series--I can already hear the \\"its the next [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]!\\" talk begin.  I heard all about that with [[ASIN:0062024027 Divergent]], [[ASIN:0312590563 Glow (Sky Chasers)]], and [[ASIN:014241977X Matched (Matched (Paperback - Trilogy))]] and didn't think any of them held a candle to The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Cinder, however, is a bit different.  I'm not going to go so far as to say I liked it as much as The Hunger Games but I will say Cinder has immense potential to be a true gem of a series.  Where The Hunger Games excelled (and the other books I mentioned failed) was character development.  Katniss was a complex character with real emotional depth and Cinder can really hold her own in this category.  Cinder isn't overwhelmed with emotion, fear or hate but exhibits all of them throughout the story and her decisions/actions throughout the book ring true.  She isn't a blindly trusting sheep but she also isn't a loner.  I found this balance really refreshing.<br /><br />Now, this book isn't perfect.  Its slow and there is a lot of setup--however, it isn't ever boring.  You are learning new things about the world, Cinder and the other characters throughout the story.  While there aren't any gun fights or heart pounding sequences, it isn't without building tension.  The other issue with the book is its predictability.  I don't want to ruin any plotpoints but there are a few things that you can kind of see coming from a few miles away.  I don't think this really hurts the story though--much as you know Katniss is going to go to the Hunger Games, and most heroes/heroines win in the end, the joy is in getting there and seeing how it unfolds.<br /><br />I am incredibly anxious to read the next installment and I certainly hope it is released soon.  If Marissa Meyer can deliver on the delicious little world she has set up in Cinder, this series really could go on the shelf right next to The Hunger Games as one of the great young adult series.<br /><br />Its four stars now but could easily be a five star series.  Just don't let me down, Marissa--I really want to love this.t series.    Its four stars now but could easily be a five star series.  Just don't let me down, Marissa--I really want to love this.
098357670X|5.0|Recently, I purchased Tom Richmond's Mad Art of Caricature book. Having worked as a full time editorial cartoonist back in the 80's, I wish I could have had this book. It definitely would have helped me in my caricaturing abilities. I always drew caricatures from the outside in rather than the inside out. I first had my eyes open to this when I went to work at Six Flags Over Georgia back in the 90's as a theme park caricaturist. For the last 15 years I have been doing mostly t-shirt design for screen printers and not as much caricature. This book has inspired me to get back into doing more caricatures.I remember when I was a kid and I got Nick Meglin's fine book, The Art of Humorous Illustration, I wore that book out devouring every page. I suspect that I will do the same with this new book. Job well done Tom!!!!

B005ZUR724|4.0|This game is a great morpg, to play you must be connected to wi-fi. The game is a little over 600 Mb, with updates supposedly coming soon. At this discount price of $4.99, you get three months of play, after that there are continuous fees per month if you still wish to play. Graphics are decent,  for the kindle fire, this app has the best graphics out for it at the moment. Graphics similar to the mmorpgs back in the mid 2000's like dark age of camelot, everquest 1. About 2-3 thousand players can be online at any given moment. Gameplay is enjoyable, all the basic aspects in basic mmorpgs are visable, like groups, guilds, shops, masteries, global chat, many quests, rare loot. there are four classes, warrior, mage, monk, bowman.<br />One thing I DONT like is the camera, you have to constantly keep using your finger to turn around. to loot a corpse when it is displayed next to your joystick can be a problem.

I loved him on Idol, loved the first album, have listened to his 3rd album (Break the Spell) online and its good...but this album, will be hard to top!  There are always songs I skip on CDs, not this one, love every single one. Several years later, I'm still listening to it often and my 2 girls 6&3 know almost every word to every song as well. I love his sound, I love that he is \\"rock\\" not \\"pop\\" yet not hard rock and keeps all his songs very clean.  If you are gonna buy any Daughtry CD, I would recommend this one above all the rest. All are fabulous, but there is just something special about this one. Keep them coming Chris!!!!!!!!

B00376AWHK|2.0|These Audio Fidelity gold CD's become immediate collector items the second they stop releasing them. In my experience they're largely hit and miss. The quality of the original recording can't be improved upon and that appears to be the case here. I don't know if the original was loaded with hiss or some other noise but the upper frequencies are very attenuated on this recording. Very dry without much ambiance. I've heard better.

1451627289|2.0|This book would be better as a short story.  The book is made up of chapter after chapter of nothing happening (in the thriller, sci fi sense).  I guess if you want to read a story about the good old day where a teacher has a romance, direct high school plays, drives around, and a story with oodles of references to past commercials and products (none of which advances the story) then this might be for you.  If you are looking for a Stephen King novel where something is always happening (Dark Tower series, The Stand, Dumas Key, etc.)then you will be very disappointed.  Actually, I found that I could just skim and skip through large portions of the book without missing any key information (like I said, most of the book is a day in the life of a teacher stuff that has nothing to do with the plot.  I am glad that King minimized his anti-republican comments in the book-- of course, the communist/racist organization in Georgia in the 1950's is labeled by King as-- you guessed it-- the Tea Partyers; gag.
0525423281|4.0|I'm torn on this review. I feel like the book should get five stars for plot and characters but four stars for the leading man. Maybe 4.5 stars? Don't get me wrong, I liked Cricket a lot (although I confess his name bugged the crap out of me). However I could never really understand what exactly Lola saw in him. Yes, he seemed to be a nice, quirky guy...and he was clearly all about Lola from the very beginning. But he seemed socially off...like I was actually expecting some sort of big reveal about him having Aspergers or something along those lines. And I just didn't find him as swoon-worthy as many of the other reviewers did...at least not until the end where he really stepped up and started taking charge. The truth of the matter is...Cricket is no Etienne. And therein lies the problem for me. Of course, it's not like the author would be doing a great job if she simply cookie-cuttered her most popular leading man into subsequent books. So I get we needed someone new, fresh, different to balance out Lola (who I loved, btw). So again, back to the ratings: I'm feeling this is probably a five-star book but because it didn't deliver the goods for me in the way that Anna and the French Kiss did, I'm giving it four stars.<br /><br />Other likes/dislikes:<br /><br />1) The author totally hits it out of the park with her fantastic SF setting. And she really seems to get the City too...in all it's pros and cons.<br />2) Lola's parents are awesome! Hurray for a book that features a gay family and gets it right...there's just enough \\"gayness\\" to make her dads fun/funny...and a whole lot more loving/responsible parenting as one should see in any balanced/stable family. So many times authors toss in stereotypes when it comes to the whole \\"gay parent\\" theme....but Lola and her family felt like the real deal.<br />3) Max. I would have liked to see the situation between he and Lola handled with more depth. I mean, he's obviously got some stuff he needs to work out...but he put a lot more into his relationship with Lola than a guy his age and with his background normally would. Yet he went from being a relatively cool fellow to a nasty customer rather abruptly, IMHO. Also, I knew I was going to have a small problem with Cricket when I found myself wishing Lola and Max were at the center of the book. But that says more about my personal taste (or lack thereof) in leading man material than anything else. ; )<br />4) Lola rocks. I thoroughly enjoyed her character, quirks and all. I hope we get to see glimpses of her and Cricket in the next book due in 2012.<br />5) We kept hearing an awful lot about Cricket's family but aside from his difficult-to-like twin sister and older brother, we see his mom twice and his dad never makes an appearance. Perhaps this is supposed to be indicative of how little Crickets' parents have focused on him.....but it just seemed strange to me. For a family so involved in the success of some of their kids, I think we should have seen more of them.<br />6) How fun it was to see Anna and Etienne again! And not just once or twice but throughout the book. Yay!<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I read this book...while the romance didn't really set the sparks flying for me, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and watching Lola develop and mature. I look forward to the next book!!ot more into his relationship with Lola than a guy his age and with his background normally would.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I respect musical experimentation but this is pure crap.  Death Magnetic, and any other \\"real\\" Metallica album for that matter, is 1000 times better than this piece of junk.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I am very choosy about what movies I actually go to the theater and see these days with the price of movie theater tickets getting higher and higher. I chose this one based on hearing such good reviews but also since I live in the Jackson, MS area. I vaguely remembered them talking on the news about this movie being filmed here, thinking, that it would not be anything worth seeing. Boy was I wrong. I took my mom to see this movie and we both loved it. I think that anyone who lives in MS or the South should DEFINITELY see it. It is a definite eye-opener to some of the behaviors in the South, besides the ones you learn about in history class. Just another piece of our history that needs to be taught. The acting was wonderful on all accounts. There were moments of sadness, seriousness and comedy. Definitely Oscar worthy for more than one nomination. Will likely be getting the movie too when it comes out on DVD.

B004QX07G4|2.0|I selected this book for our Book Club to read because I love Ellen, think she is hilarious and full of energy.  WOW!  This book reads as though she is trying to find things to talk about to fill in pages...not interesting in the least and very few funny parts.  It was all I could do to finish this book and would probably not have done so if it had not been my selection for our Book Club.  Several members of our Book Club listened to the audio tapes and had the same feedback as those of us that read it...dull.  This is the first book that I have read by Ellen and will as a result, stick to watching her show.
0143034901|5.0|The plot leaves you guessing until the very end, and it's brilliantly organized. All of the clever, clever character connections throughout are almost \\"Great Expectations\\"-esque. Some of the romance scenes get pprreeettttyyyyyyy cheesy, but it's more than balanced out by the rest of the story content. I'd DEFINITELY recommend this book!
B005KELW26|3.0|I really do like the color of this Kindle Fire cover because purple is my favorite color.  It is quite a flimsy cover and although it does protect the Fire, I'm not sure it would be much use if it was dropped.  My Kindle Fire fits perfectly inside the elastic straps and I'd probably say the cover is really only worth about $10.  Had it not been purple, I would have returned it.  I really don't expect the cover to last too long and it would be nice if it could also fold into a stand.

1439102732|1.0|I have enjoyed many of Jodi Picoult's books, but frankly this one was boring and repetitive. The preacher, Zoe, Max, Vanessa kept repeating themselves endlessly. It's less than a 1 star book, in my opinion.
0312588887|5.0|First, let me say, I usually do not read romance novels.  But I had a long day of travelling ahead of me, waiting in airports, etc. so I purchased this novel as a way to pass some time.  This book so drew me in.  Barbara Taylor Bradford's writing is so descriptive it brings every element of this book to life.  The language she uses to describe the countryside of England, Leeds and London of days gone by, to the Cities of New York and modern day London draws me in.  The arc of the story following the life of Emma Harte from childhood in service to her rise as an international magnate and the catalyst behind it all is riveting. The emotions, the landscape, the characters that Emma encounters throughout her life are so well defined that you cannot help but be drawn in.  This book was the first Barbara Taylor Bradford book that I had ever read.  It made me an instant fan.  I have since collected everything that woman has written.  I highly recommend this book.
0756404746|4.0|I had heard a lot of hype prior to reading this one.  And mostly, it lived up to the hype.  The plot centers around Kvothe, as told by his older barkeeping self, Kote.  It is a coming of age story of Kvothe, told in story-telling mode in a series of flashbacks broken up once in awhile by the present day storyteller.  I love the fantasy genre, and was a little disappointed there wasn't a little more action in this one.  The only real action was at the end, and even then it felt a little tacked on.  Still, reading this novel really did feel like I was sitting down with a friend, listening to a really great, entertaining story.  And I liked that, a lot.  I'm looking forward to the next novel in the series and seeing what happens to the great Kvothe.
1451627289|3.0|No spoliers! Okay. As some others have written, the book has a wonderful, grabber opening. I was taken in by the premise. But, the entire middle section of the book is tedious. Simply, this book should have been 300 pages and not the 800+ that was written. (Amazingly, this is my first Stephen King book, and will probably be my last.) I am stunned by the five and four star review. I just found myself skimming over the entire middle portion of the book. I was curious about the ending so, I gathered my courage, and plodded on. I just could not endure the detail, upon unnecessary detail. (I have refrained from the details of the middle portion to avoid spoliers.) Take book out of the library or borrow a copy. Great premise ruined by the author's desire to overwhelm us with the past and the details of an interetsing time traveller.

140053271X|1.0|I have had my Nook for over a year now and I think it is a great ereader. HOWEVER DO NOT buy your content from Barnes and Noble. In the first few months I had it I purchased about 30 books using their awesome click to buy feature. Then back in February, I thought I lost my credit card and cancelled it. I hadn't yet updated my new card on Barnes and Noble's site when I went to reread a book I had purchased months before. IT WOULD NOT DOWNLOAD. I called support and was told that their policy requires an active credit card to access books I have already paid for. This policy creates a lot of the problems.  1) I don't feel the books are mine. I paid for them.

0375704027|2.0|I first picked this up at the library because I was interested in reading Japanese fiction translated into English (and who better than Murakami, who's been so highly praised?). But I found this to be a terrible disappointment. the summary sounded nice in theory, but I didn't like any of the characters. They did things that were despicable, and just completely alienated my sympathy from them. I felt like they were just going through the motions of doing things that were sometimes shocking and other times not so, but in the end, they remained just flat characters to me. Everybody, with the exception of maybe the protagonist, remained strangers to me.  Another problem for me was that the translation I read to be very uncomfortable -- there's something very odd about the way the sentences are phrased. Maybe this was due to the fact that this novel was Japanese translated into English and maybe this was due to my inexperience with such novels, but I felt that the phrasing was very awkward and difficult to enjoy smoothly. I've read Kokoro by Natsume Soseki since and I like that novel much more than this in terms of both the story and the way the translation read.  This is just my take on it, but I would recommend that any reader interested in this novel should give it a try and discover for themselves whether they like this or not.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Very disappointing.  I am sorry I spent money on this book, belongs in a collection of short stories, not full length book.
B002JVWQSW|4.0|I'm a little late on the bandwagon, but we got this show as a black Friday deal. It is really very funny, and it keeps getting better.  Kind of reminds me of The Office, which is fine by me. Lots of awkward comedy, and often has things happen slightly in the background that could be easy to miss (which is one of my favorite comedic tools). Overall, we are so far very happy with the purchase. Have enjoyed hours of hilarity.<br /><br />The DVD itself comes in a slimline case (standard DVD movie size), and the packaging seems secure and not overly cheap. No notes or inserts, but the disks seem to be secure.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|If you look at the dates of the early bad reviews seem to have jumped the gun on reviewing as this product did not ship until the Kindle Fire did so there is no way I know of that people had the case as of Nov 14th (checking days of these bad reviews)or even if by the stretch of the imagination and they were the few that the product was shipped to before an official release - they did not have Kindle Fire to give it a try with.  Its pretty obvious that these were just the same ones that run around posting bad reviews for lack of anything better to do - without having a clue about the product.  Anyway - its a great case, fits well without increasing the profile of the Kindle a great deal or adding to the weight.  It fits perfectly, without slipping around.  The hard back shell is definitely protective and I love the way he top folds to make a stand for the Kindle Fire.  The only problem I had, but it was me and not the cover is I would often close it p and forget to loop the band back to the front to keep the 'lid' closed ad then it would get pushed up by other things in my pocketbook.  Took me a couple of days just to get used to automatically closing the case with the band.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I didn't expect anything less from Florence + the Machine. I can definitely relate to the songs. I think the album was done beautifully.
0316066524|5.0|By the time I got about 25-30% of the way through this massive piece of text, it had become my favorite book. I love Vonnegut, but something about this book is more complete, even though it's still a satire. You can see the influence of Vonnegut (and many others) on Wallace's writing, but there is not a single bit of hackery to be found. Wallace has an omniscient voice, as if he really does know pretty much everything, and I honestly do think that I did more external research during my close reading of Infinite Jest than I did in my entire college experience. Every sentence is poetic, despite being prose, and the pregnant meanings hidden behind the obscure and archaic terms are like little presents that reward your reading further with every definition sought. References to famous artists, philosophers, and scientists throughout the book are similarly engrossing, and if for example you wonder why Hal, very early on, thinks Dennis Gabor may have been the antichrist, I suggest you look Mr. Gabor up, and retain that puzzle piece off to the side until you find the spot in the story where it fits.<br />Within this book, our entire future is explored, from a uniquely American perspective. It is terribly tragic, yet wrought with levity and wit at every turn, and there is no more-poignant commentary on the American condition. Wallace deftly illustrates a world where \\"addiction\\" and \\"entertainment\\" are thematically married, and struggles to make sense of the futility, the hilarity, and the source of it all. Be warned, though: This book is alive. It has many personalities, expressed by many voices, but at its core there is a single soul, and as comedic and fantastic as the story seems, it can at times be dreadfully, overwhelmingly real. Wallace has captured something magical and powerful within the pages of Infinite Jest, and you will not walk away from it unchanged.<br />Highly, highly recommended. Absolutely breathtaking.
1423140591|5.0|Awesome read!  I finished this book in less than a week and couldn't put it down!  So glad Percy Jackson is back, I missed him in the last book.  Sad I have to wait a year for the next one =/

B000003C2S|5.0|This album, along with Death's first two albums, served as my introduction to death metal.  Out of those three, Spiritual Healing is definatly my favorite.  This album marks Death's first foray into more progressive teritory, which would be further explored on future albums.  The album is more progressive, not only musically, but also lyrically. Chuck Schuldiner ditches the cliched b-movie horror lyrics, and replaces them with, get this, actually relevant social comentary.  Chuck writes about topics such as abortion, the death penalty, cloning, violence, and religion.  The best part about this is that Chuck actually makes some good points.  The only lyrical slip up for me is \\"Living Monstrosity\\" which just might have some of the most unintentionally hilarious lyrics i've ever heard.  Musically, the album features better production, better musicianship (THE SOLOS! THE SOLOS!), and better thought out arrangements.  Some of my favorite tracks are \\"Spiritual Healing\\", \\"Low Life\\", \\"Killing Spree\\", and , the first Death song I ever heard, \\"Within The Mind\\".  This is an amazing album that, along with Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy, serves as an awesome intro to death metal.

It's a wonder any of our GI's made it back to their families and our Free America!  I recommend this and his other books!

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I agree with all of the high praises for this book. I was thinking of writing a full review of the book as well but with close to 1,500 other reviews I don't have anything to add that would be worthy of taking your time. Instead I thought I would give it the five star rating it deserves and point out one thing that has the potential to rub some groups of people the wrong way.<br /><br />Being a trained Nave Seal and having strong, deeply rooted Texan values, Marcus Lattrell (The coauthor and the man who's experience this book is about) has been indoctrinated (I couldn't think of a more accurate term to use, I say indoctrinated for it's definition and not to be carrying a negative connotation.) with conservative ideology and beliefs. To me that is not a problem and I completely understand all of his comments about the issue. He does at times in the book have a very negative tone towards Liberals, praises President Bush highly, and negatively portrays the \\"liberal media\\". Again I understand why he feels like he does and I can appreciate his opinion. But while I was reading the book I thought how this topic could really be offensive to many readers and then when the same comments were repeated multiple times I worried that some people may be turned off by it and have their whole experience with this awesome book ruined.<br /><br />A sample of this topic would be \\"the entire business of modern war crimes, as identified by the liberal wings of politics and the media began in Iraq and has been running downhill ever since. Everyone's got to have his little hands in it, blathering on about the public's right to know\\". There are at least 17 comments about this issue and they are all negatively attacking liberal ideology. Again I don't personally care and I hope if something like this would bother you that you read this great book with an open mind and let it slide off your back. This is one heck of a story. And the fact that there are records of the events so the readers won't hear about another untruthful author reliving a heroic event, makes this book even better.<br /><br />In the end I went through every emotion available reading this book. One of the few books I have ever read in one sitting (I read slow so it was a really long sitting), I couldn't put it down because it was obvious the next page was going to be full of excitement in one form or another. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a thrilling, emotionally charged book. You won't be disappointed. And please, all of you \\"liberal media\\" fans don't get all worked up and see past his feelings in that regard so you can appreciate this book for all it is worth.r untruthful author reliving a heroic event, makes this book even better.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I will admit that I am not even a Reacher fan yet have read every single one of his books, unfortunately including his latest, the Affair.  The Affair was awful while in comparison, Killing Floor, an anthony award winner,  was almost sublime.<br /><br />I am sure that Lee Childs read Hemingway and if not, then certainly Robert B Parker who writes with short cryptic lead weighted pipes of words.  I might be considered odd for saying this, but Jack Reacher, a cold blooded killer if you ever met one, is actually a bit softer than than Parkers  Bostonian.  Reacher has a pure heart, no attachments, no loves, and many big hates.  In comic book style and Reacher is right up there with the Hulk, Captain American and no, not spider man because spider man is subtle, for hating injustice and bullies.  He does not even love his country although having served it for 13 years as a soldier, he simply does not know it.  His father was a soldier you see and Reacher spent all of his growing up on dusty flyspecked spaces in American bases all over the world.  He had, er has an older  brother named Joe who is bigger than he is yet softer and brighter it seems.  Something happens to the relationship in this story and Georgia is not the same afterwards.<br /><br />Reacher apparently likes the blues because he goes into a really obscure little Georgian town replete with red necked sheriff and a colonel saunders sort of mayor who even sports a cane to see where a long dead blues singer once sang.  It is a perfect little town with groomed lawns, big houses and even people who drive bentleys.  Heaven on earth you think, but no, it is actually a hell controlled by an evil criminal who immigrated North from Latin American to expand his options and to give his low browed monster of a son, a new field to exercise his rather foul tasting options.  Reacher ends up in the hoosegow in this one where he lays to the right and lays to the left and leaves a big impression on gangsters in the county lock up.<br /><br />A state secret is involved, ivy league colleges are involved and the feds are present as is the security of the very United States.  The only thing you dont have to worry about in this take is Reacher safety.  You just know that this strong clear thinking, coffee swilling man will somehow maintain the right and discover what is wrong and with his fists and whatever other weapon is laying about, set the world straight.  e<br /><br />I rate this a four.t is involved, ivy league colleges are involved and the feds are present as is the security of the very United States.

B000001DYY|2.0|Roland Orzabal was always the main singer and songwriter for the group, but after listening to Elemental, I wondered if I had been underestimating Curt Smith's contributions. The sweeping production is impressive, but it only serves to distract from the thinness of the material. Only \\"Fish Out Of Water\\" and \\"Power\\" have enough melodic interest to stand on their own.

0060873027|2.0|I was looking forward to this novel, excited that there would be another Chricton offering after all these years, and I was willing to forgive the less than scientific premise here.  But this is just not good writing.  I have to wonder what it might have been like if the author could have finished it himself.  I'm an amateur entomologist and was intrigued by a world of tiny people among bugs but this novel pales with Kurt Carlton's Prophets of the Ghost Ants which I read a few months back and which is apparently in development as a movie.  It's more of a science-fantasy that immerses itself into a future where humans have evolved to the size of insects and live among them as parasites.  It had great characters, interesting themes, was smart and sexy  -- qualities that Micro is missing.  Maybe the bar was raised too high by this other novel but Micro felt flimsy.  It was an all too easy read, like a bad comic book.

0446581348|4.0|Growing up, I never really learned how to apply makeup beyond the occasional lip gloss and mascara. This book is great for a novice such as myself, as it goes into great detail while explaining the products used and how to use them. I particularly enjoyed the skin and foundation sections, as those are the biggest problems for me. The book lists the pros and cons of different types of makeup and is very clear in its recommendations depending on your skin type. I have found this to be an invaluable resource when playing around with new looks, and I'm glad to have it around when I need it. It doesn't really delve into unique styles, but that wasn't what I was looking for when I bought the book; I wanted a resource that would create a solid foundation of makeup knowledge that I could use as a base for creating looks of my own. I think this book did just that.
B005EGXTL2|1.0|Poorly structured , poor character development and rushed. Major story events happened while Katniss was unconscious. All of the characters felt flat. Story wise it just seemed to finish without really finishing.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|I highly recommend this little adapter to ANYONE who is installing a Flat Screen on their wall, Especially the newer Samsung and Sony's that are so thin the cables have to twist and turn to reach the connector. Sure you can find a cheaper little 90 degee adapter, hoping you bought the right configuration to turn the right way, or you can buy this quality made adapter which will do just about anything and leave the cable well trained and not under stress. I purchased two of them, one for the back of a friends 60\\" Samsung LED-LCD 3D SmartTV we just installed over the weekend. Used one of them on the back of the TV to allow the cable a smooth transition from the center of the wall mount (where the low-voltage ring/wall-plate allowed the cables to come out) and sweep over to the input side. The cable would had to have made a U-turn to plug in, but with this, it made a nice 90 degre turn into and left no strain on the port or cable. 2nd One is going to be used to change out the $3 one that still jams the cable into the wall on my own install done last Christmas. I highly recommend you order this just to be safe and have handy when hanging your new TV. Maybe you won't need it, but at $7 its cheap insurance that goes a long way. No issues with 3D Support or bandwidth/data transmission.
B005ORVMT2|5.0|Rush has long been my favorite band, and I have more or less owned every iteration of these albums that Rush has released: cassettes, then vinyl, then the initial Mercury CD pressings, and the 1997 remasters.  But even my \\"fanboy-ness\\" knows its limits, so when these box sets were first announced, I was a bit sceptical.  Was this another desperate Mercury cash-grab, as has been alleged on so many Rush fan sites?  My reservations disappeared as soon as I held this set.  First, the packaging is very nice.  Each album is done as a replica of the original vinyl release.  Having spent hours upon hours in high school looking at the gatefolds for the vinyl versions, this was like coming home to an old friend.  A booklet is also included with printed lyrics, rare photos, album credits, etc (apparently just in case the album replica writing was too small.....)  But I was most pleased with the sound.  In a side-by-side with the '97 releases (which as a whole I thought were very well done), these new remasters do present a very clear, if subtle improvement.  This batch of albums especially have always suffered from murky sound.  These remasters FINALLY fix that problem -- it's as if a layer of murk has been removed from the sound.  The effect is most noticable in the crispness of the drums, but there are sonic improvements to be noticed across the board.  And it's not just a matter of louder mastering either.  In fact, the volume here is nearly identical to that of the 1997 remasters.  These versions really do sound better.  Then of course, there is the fabulous 5.1 mix of \\"Fly By Night.\\"  What an amazing job!  Until you've heard \\"Anthem\\" coming t you from all angles, you haven't lived.  So, in the end, for the $45 price tag, I would say these are worth it.  Perhaps not if you primarily listen as MP3, but all in all a great job done by the engineers and Mercury.
1594744769|4.0|I'll be honest, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was not at all what I was expecting! Actually, I didn't really know what to expect. All I knew was that everyone else who read it had LOVED it, and I had to read it ASAP! I am so glad that I can finally say I read Peculiar Children! It wasn't like anything I had read before, and the creepy pictures and setting just added to the mystery of the story.  The beginning of the book did go kind of slow for me, and I would have stopped reading if I didn't trust some of the reviews I read on it. I felt like for the first quarter of the book I was just waiting and waiting for something exciting to happen. When I started to figure out what was going on, that's when the book just flew by.  I really enjoyed the main character, Jacob. He was funny and extremely loyal.  The way he was able to digest the information about the peculiar children, I thought, was very believable. I also loved all of the peculiar children. They were so much fun! I thought they were going to be evil, but they weren't, which was nice.  Ransom is a very talented writer and storyteller. Even while the book was slow for me in the beginning, I still thought that the writing flowed nicely. The story was also very original. I heard there will be a second book, and I am extremely excited to read it!  And those pictures! They just added so much to the story and I loved how Riggs incorporated them into the story. They fit perfectly!  This is a story that is not to be missed. I recommend every one who hasn't to go out and read it right away!

0525423281|5.0|I think I'm one of the few people that actually liked Anna and the French Kiss more then Lola and the Boy Next Door. Some of my favorite scenes in Lola were the ones where St. Clair and Anna were in! That isn't to say that I didn't LOVE Lola, because I did! It had everything I could want in a YA contemporary!  I loved Lola! I loved her awesome and original style and I loved her confidence! She is someone that every teenage girl should strive to be becasue she doesn't care about what other people think. She works at a movie theatre, has a bad boy rocker boyfriend, has great friends (which included Anna and St. Clair) and has two awesome dads! I loved her dads. They were the perfect blend of father protectiveness and awesomeness. Lola is the kind of girl you would want to be BFFs with! She was just so believable and real.  The boy next door is Cricket Bell and he is great! He's kind, unique and adorable.  He is also extremely intelligent. There really isn't anything bad to say about him. He's perfect!  Him and Lola are so cute together. They are awkward, and silly, and sweet. Their friendship was real, and so were their feelings. I loved them!  I also was really happy with how many scenes Anna and St. Clair were in. I thought we were only going to see them in passing or very briefly, but they actually played a big part in the story. Now, I want to go back and read Anna again!  Stephanie Perkins in my opinion is becoming the Queen of YA contemporary! She can do no wrong and I am looking forward to what she has in store for us next!
031261246X|5.0|Updated on 06/27/216:<br />I read (actually listened) to Zero Day again on Audible and it was even better!!! The narrator was very good and it made working out at the gym go by fast. This time around I really appreciated that this story had tight subplots and was very clean in terms of writing style. I am almost half way into Trojan Horse by Mark Russinovich on Audible and I am thoroughly enjoying it !!!<br /><br />Older Review:<br />Even if I had not been working in networking and security for over a decade I believe I would still like this book. It is a thriller set in the real world with a security crisis that could happen at anytime. The two main characters, a man (Jeff) and woman (Daryl) are very likeable and I would definitely like to read more about them. The plot is good, we do some traveling and you always need a good assassin which Zero Day has. Mark Russinovich can be proud of this one and I can not wait for his next, hopefully with more Jeff & Daryl! Mark did tweet that he would have a book coming out in September 2012 so I will definitely be buying it!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is the first Stephen King novel I've read and I walk away extremely impressed.  The first 2/3 of the book was a great page turner (I finished the book in 48 hours).  I especially enjoyed the parts of the book that described the sights, sounds, and tastes of 1958.  The plot is riveting.  I found the following shortcomings:  (1) The details about Oswald are a little overkill.  I got bored by a lot of it.  (2) Some of the violent scenes were a little too graphic.    (3) The ending was flat and didn't deliver the promise of the book.  However, even with the underwhelming ending I walk away extremely satisfied with this book.  I highly recommend it.

When she learned of this book, we had to order it! She is a handicapped adult, a perpetual child, and the wait for the book to release and be sent seemed endless, but finally it arrived and she was thrilled and loves it!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I enjoyed this King novel immensely. It's my favorite King novel since \\"The Stand.\\"  I find myself rating King's non-horror novels highest, although I do enjoy his horror,too!  I just feel he spends more time on character in these books.  I've read volumiously on the Kennedy assassination, and the details are spot on.  King captures the flavor of the early 1960's beautifully, as far as I can tell (as I was born in 1962, I can't really know), but it fits with how I remember my parents talking about how the assassination felt and how things were then.  I identifed with Jake, the main character, as he navigated the past and made monumental choices. And King's portrait of Lee Harvey Oswald is as creepy as it is authentic.  Read this, and weep. As did everyone who lived through that day - 11/22/1963.
B005BDZN62|5.0|I'll begin by admitting that, of all the genres of movies, one of my least favorites is the so-called musicals. They have to be well-executed to work and to impress audiences and critics alike. However, there are notable exceptions, and the marvelous \\"West Side Story\\" is one of them. This is a triumph of mayor proportions in the history of cinema, and now, with the release of its delicious Blu-ray edition, this important film looks better than ever - a must have..    With the exception of the late Natalie Wood, the cast of \\"West Side Story\\" is mostly of relatively unknown actors, whose careers were mostly known in Broadway, some of which participated in the original stage production of the movie, by Robert E. Griffith and Harold S. Prince, and the book written by Arthur Laurents.   The film's beginning and end are just astonishing and original, as the story itself. It takes place in New York City, where there was racial tensions in the working-class neighborhoods, between some whites (of assorted ethnical origins) against Puerto Ricans. The first group, of course, believed that the second was invading their turf. These groups or gangs had names - the Puerto Ricans were the Sharks, led by Bernardo (George Chakiris) and the others were the Jets, whose leader was Riff (Russ Tamblin). Unfortunately, the daily confrontations escalate to dangerous levels once Maria (Wood), Bernardo's sister, gets is love with Tony (Richard Beymer), one ex-Jets who has reformed himself and is living a decent life. That doesn't matter, of course: a Jet will always be a Jet, and the Shark, as one characters says, is \\"Once an immigrant, always an immigrant.\\" In-between all this rubble, there is the magnificent and fiery Anita (Rita Moreno).  \\"West Side Story\\" is many things at once: a well-elaborated musical, which mixes the reality of the times with music and dance; a story about prejudice and tolerance; or a modern love story a la Romeo and Juliet (as it has been referred). The result is just fascinating in every sense. The music works, the message works, and the dancing works - everything works. And it has to be that way, with the choreography by Jerome Robbins, the lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, the music by Leonard Bernstein, and the direction by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins, all geniuses in their own fields.  And then there is the excellent, colorful and masterful cinematography by Daniel Fapp. The film won ten Academy Awards in 1961, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Chakiris) and Best Supporting Actress (Moreno, who steals her scenes). If you are ever going to buy a musical, this is it, for sure. The fantastic Blue-ray 3-disc edition includes the DVD of the film, song-specific commentary by Sondheim, West Side Memories, Storyboard-to-film comparison montage, and much more! (USA, 1961, color, 153 min plus additional materials).  Reviewed on November 29, 2011 exclusively by Eric Gonzalez for Metro Goldwyn Mayer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not stop reading this compelling and rewarding series - staying up until the wee hours to finsh each one in a day!  This is not a kid's novel, but a minutely observed projection of a possible future.  The commentary on our media age and what it could come to is not that far-fetched!  The characters are well drawn and believable, and I was sorry to leave them when I was done.  I just hope the coming movie captures the magic!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It does exactly what it says it does. it gives hour by hour weather forecasts, plus forecasts for up to ten days ahead. I can change the zip as I need to or have it follow me through gps. It doesn't drain my battery like a bunch of other apps. I do have one tiny little gripe. Sometimes it doesn't always connect to my network and I have to wait a little longer to get my weather. Other than that, I love it.
0446547603|5.0|As a first time reader of Nicholas Sparks, I have to say I really enjoyed this book! It's one of those books that will have you reading into the wee hours of the night because you want to know more. I'll definitely be reading more of his books.
B005KELQEU|4.0|My new Kindle Touch fits perfectly inside this sleeve without any problems. It is sized correctly for the Touch. As others have noted, it is a \\"sleeve,\\" and it cannot be opened all the way and laid flat so that you can read your Kindle while it is \\"wearing\\" its little coat here, but that's fine. I didn't want a big, bulky thing on my Kindle when reading it anyway. It's nicely padded. Regarding price, considering that you can go to a department store and get a giant purse on sale for $20-25, this small, simple item does seem a bit overpriced (I'm thinking more like $9.99 would be more appropriate), but it is the cheapest sleeve Amazon currently sells, so there you go. One thing the manufacturer might think to do in the future is to make the vinyl part of the sleeve with an OPEN top so that it can be used to store small items, such as your Kindle recharging cord, or a screen wipe, etc. I may do that myself as the it looks as though the vinyl part is merely sewn over the stretchy part underneath. It has a nice, clean look to it and hides the Kindle from view if you put it in your purse. I'm not unhappy with it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|like others have said, the first 2 are awesome. which is why this book is so disappointing. did not get the same feel as the others and characters are not as interesting. the last part while they were fighting inside capitol is ridiculous. glad i didnt buy it and just read at bookstore instead. sigh. could have been great.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This was my first taste of Denise Grover Swanks writing and I fell in love with the book and the main character.  You are able to watch Rose grow in confidence and you soon fall in love with her character.  It is very heart warming and she charms you throughout the book.  You want to throw down the bad guys for her and cheer her on as she fights her way through the story line.  I hope to read more about Rose in the future!!

0811879542|4.0|This book was intriguing to children; some adults I showed did not like it at all.  But when I brought it home to my 8-year old, she loved it although she knew she was not changing anything by touching the pages. The concept is difficult for grownups to grasp; but kids love it.  Glad I purchased it.
0060873027|2.0|This book is imaginative, I'll give it that. But Crichton's writing always had the gravitas and smarts to back up his premises with so much science (sometimes too much science...) that even the far-flung ideas never seemed like they'd been flung completely out of the realm of possibility. Even \\"Prey,\\" which had a similar nano-believability issue, was dragged squarely into the believe-ability zone by Crichton's deft hand. I like his stuff better when it rises above mere \\"cautionary tale\\" (\\"careful of genetics!\\" \\"careful of nanotechnology!\\") and becomes a true heart-pounding adventure. This does have some of that pacing... But the lack of edifying information alone makes \\"Micro\\" seem like a ghost-written piece, which it clearly and unfortunately is.    Speaking of giant insects and ghost-writers (actually ghost-riders)... I liked \\"Prophets of the Ghost Ants\\" by Clark Carlton a lot more. It's a far more ambitious world where entire human-run ant colonies clash over backyard-sized turf, and there's a lot more human destiny and struggle involved. And it's also creepy as hell.    For all of that, it still seems more real than \\"Micro\\"...  [[ASIN:1460949048 Prophets of the Ghost Ants]]
B005HP2JAM|4.0|When I first saw this film, it was playing in theaters. It was the first 3D film I saw that I knew would simply not have worked in 2D. My original review concentrated on the content of the film, and its portrayal of the art work. I decided to rewrite my review to address the Blu-ray 3D release itself. How much you will enjoy this still has to do with how likely you would be to watch a documentary about caves in the first place.<br /><br />After owning a 3D HDTV for about a year, I now have my second 3D title. The first one came with the TV. It's not that I dislike 3D, but 3D offerings have been scant, overpriced, or simply for titles that I didn't think were worth owning or didn't benefit enough from 3D to warrant a purchase. In this case, I knew before the Blu-ray disc was released that I wanted to own it as soon as it came out. Overall, I'm not disappointed.<br /><br />The film still stands on its merits. The presentation, however, comes with a few artifacts that were not present in the theatrical release. One recent review I read was from a viewer who questioned whether it was even shot in 3D. For the most part, I think the 3D presentation on the Blu-ray disc held up to my expectations. But there were a few places where pieces of the background shifted to the foreground in a very distracting way. Overall, I stand by my belief that this film simply would not work in 2D.  All you need to do is close one eye while watching some of the scenes, and you will see how you completely lose a sense of how the cave and the art go together.<br /><br />When I watched the film in a theater, I wondered early on how well it would hold up for the length of a feature film, given the number of items that were presented. As with a visit to a museum, pacing is important. In a museum, you have the advantage that you can spend as little or as much time as you want looking at any given work of art. For that reason, it was important for the film maker to show multiple perspectives of many of the same areas. Although a disc version gives the added advantage of a pause button, it's also a matter of lighting, angle, and other factors that go into your ability to appreciate each drawing.<br /><br />Aside from the film itself, the only special feature is a \\"documentary\\" about the music made for the documentary. It's mostly just footage of the composer and musicians putting together various parts of the score, but somewhere in the middle it does go into the composer's five string cello with a low F string, and how it came to be. Documentaries assume a certain specific audience to begin with, and this will appeal to a limited overlapping subset.<br /><br />Overall, I'm still glad I bought this. Subsequent viewings made me less forgiving of some of the excesses of the narration and its philosophical ramblings, but you need to watch this for the subject matter and overlook those. While the 3D transfer might not have lived up to what the theatrical release offered, I can't say that it was enough of a problem to change my overall view. As annoyances go, I'd rather have them fix the parts that force me to watch previews and prohibit me from getting to the menu. The documentary was made under less than ideal conditions, with limited access to the cave, with limited room to film. Considering the constraints that the cinematographers had, I'm amazed at how much this film has to offer.a disc version gives the added advantage of a pause button, it's also a matter of lighting, angle, and other factors that go into your ability to appreciate each drawing.

B004H1V5RU|4.0|I bought 2 of these - one for myself to test the durability and one for a gift to an 11 year-old grandson who loves puzzles.  Contrary to my worries brought on by other reviewers, both Perplexus Epic spheres arrived in perfect shape.  It didn't take me long to realize why so many people had problems.  The maze is very, very difficult to work.  The unit is designed so that one always has to have the ball placed in the start position to begin.  Personally, I have gotten past 19 of over 120 numbers only a few times, so most of the sphere remains unexplored.  The numbers are impressed (but not colored) into the plastic, so they are somewhat hard to read, but not impossible.  I have not dropped the sphere and so far have resisted the urge to throw it against the wall, so I don't know how robust the unit is.  I have learned that if the ball lands in a track farther down the line in the puzzle when it falls out from where you're working, to continue working from that point because it may be your only chance to explore that section of the puzzle.  In short it's a puzzle that makes you want to tear your hair out.  I doubt that it could ever be completed, but I'll enjoy trying.  The second sphere is being returned.  I like to give my grandson something that he might be able to solve.  December.  Have worked with the Epic for some time.  My opinion has not changed in that it is an advanced kid/adult puzzle.  I did find starting \\"practice\\" spots: A at 33; B at 56; and C at 91.  They all lead, eventually, to nearly impossible tracks for the ball.  I'm still fascinated by maze and hope to make it to #125 some year.

B000006U44|5.0|This first album is beautiful in its haunting simplicity and innocent yearnings/lyrics of a child prodigy. I am so grateful I was introduced to this as a young woman instead of commercial drivel such as Madonna or that ex-Mouseketeer.  Kate is a true artist's artist who pulls you in with lyrics that make you think and feel for days and years after you listened to them. Quite different from most singer/songwriters in both lyrics and vocal range. Each album sounds a bit different as well, so its worth trying out another if you don't like the first one. Truly worth the listen.
B004Z29X3E|4.0|The title character is a cult follower of a charismatic leader. One day she leaves the cult and ends up staying with her sister and husband.  They are about as opposite from cult devotees as it would be possible to be.  They are almost entirely consumed with setting up house, having a baby and so forth.  However, they are \\"all there\\" mentally which cannot be said for our title character.<br /><br />Elizabeth Olsen plays that title role very well and John Hawkens as the cult leader and Hugh Dancy as her brother in law are also really good. MMMM will leave you wondering exactly what is wrong with her.  There is one thing I can be sure of: she has a pronounced lack of affect and I suspect she's always had that lack. She may also be a schizophrenic or perhaps she's having hallucinations from past drug usage or PTSD. That she needs a mental hospital is glaringly apparent as the story goes on.<br /><br />She also has a startling amount of cruelty in her as she pronounces to her sister, \\"You'll make a terrible parent,\\" knowing that her sister is trying to get pregnant.  I would have been tempted to say back, \\"Well at least I won't be a vacant, washed out mess of one.\\" The sister is less cruel though than the protagonist.<br /><br />This cult follower is not a sympathetic figure.  I would imagine in real life most of them are not. She has nothing to give anyone else other than the languorous commitment she had to her cult leader.<br /><br />The only problem with this film is that there is no one you come to care about at all.  I never empathized with a single character in it because I did not like a single character in it.  This does not mean, however, that it did not do well what it set out to do.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|It's ok imo, if you have nothing else. Even though the knife I bought was sharp I tried using this (lightly) it made my knife very dull as it quickly rolled the edge. I found out how to remedy that by oddly adjusting the angle but I just wanted to be able to use as-intended and come out with a very nice edge. That was not the case. I wish I had just bought a sharpening stone.

0811821846|4.0|I bought this for a friend who is obsessed with Star Wars and training to be a chef.  She loved it!  The spiral version was much nicer than I thought, it looks like a hardcover from the outside, and the spiral is on the inside.  Pages were nice and glossy, and had great pictures.  My only issue with it would be that the recipes inside aren't very original, they're just your everyday recipes with awesome Star Wars related names, which in my friend's case, was all that mattered.  Great buy, can't wait to see the second one.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|The pocket sharpener is a steal at this price!  It has successfully worked on several of my knives, both honing the blade quickly and easily.    I do feel that I can get a better blade using a stone, but this takes much more time and is not always convenient to carry around.  I have been using the pocket sharpener mostly when I'm out hiking or camping and it has never failed me to restore an edge to any blade.
B00005JPIJ|5.0|The film alludes to the acquaintanceship between Franz Liszt & Richard Wagner, through a modernized pseudo-rock star cinematic filter perspective. Backstage prior to a performance, the viewer becomes acquainted with Wagner, who amusingly displays the glittery name of Nietzsche upon his bowler hat, indicating his strong influence with the philosophy. During one medley, Liszt mocks Wagner with chopsticks based upon a recent conversation in the dressing room, infuriating him to leave the theater.<br /><br /> Liszt maintains several mistresses, although one night at a performance a Princess catches his eye while he fishes for new prospects, and is actually invited by her to her palace, in which she appears as a rendition of Ivan {or \\"Ivanna\\"} The Terrible. During one of several musical waking dream sequences,  she eventually manifests as a winged succubus demoness {with Sabbatic Baphomet gesticulations} threatening to amputate his member grown to humongous proportions with a guillotine, which she straddles indicating a deadly vagina awaiting entry. Seems he had made a \\"deal with the Devil\\"earlier on, and now it was time to address his end of the bargain.<br /><br />Later on, after initiating a revolution to bring the German people back to prominence, Wagner infiltrates Liszt's mansion, eventually assuming a vampiric role, fangs and all, alluding his plagiarism upon Liszt's compositions. After departing with a small fortune, Wagner goes on to become what the Pope refers to as The Antichrist {referring to his inspirations from Nietzsche's influence}. The Pope {played by Ringo Starr} pays Liszt a visit, admonishing him to exorcise Wagner or face his music being banned from the kingdom. So he sets off to find Wagner, whose reputation has assumed a very Dracula personage, from the townsfolk running scared when his name is mentioned, to the dark castle he inhabits. Seems Wagner also took possession of Liszt's daughter, who has become quite the witch, with her adeptly pressing needles & pins into an effigy of her father.<br /><br />Upon attempting to enter, he witnesses a Witch's Sabbat spectacle wherein \\"The Beast\\" appears to take savage liberties with the various disrobed virginal beauties in attendance. Finally entering, Liszt finds Wagner in a Frankensteinian laboratory bringing his creation to life, his vision of the \\"superman\\", who in this incarnation emerges as Thor {although quite a simpleton one at that}. Underwhelmed, he begins construction on another version.<br /><br />Stereotypical displays of fascistic demonstrations emerge, resembling a Nuremberg rally, where children dressed in veritable  'uberkinder wear' are programmed for world domination. While discussing developments with their mutual experiences & friendship recollections with Liszt, then amused, subsequently enraged by Liszt's attempt to exorcise him by sneaking holy water into his Bloody Mary {upon which he resumes his vampire appearance}, Wagner himself goes from Germanic casual wear to a very superman-like outfit complete with a logo resembling Wonder Woman's insignia.<br /><br />Upon the final battle, arising from the rubble, Wagner resurrects as a Hitlerian Frankenstein monster rampaging his way across the earth, destroying everything in sight, save for the uber-kinder following close behind.<br /><br />The film concludes with Liszt apparently in some sort of \\"heaven\\"-like environment, accompanied by his mistresses, when they decide to descend to earth to rid the world of the destructive scourge.<br /><br />Lisztomania is absolutely replete with dark humor, sensuality, double-ententes, metaphor, & symbolism, accented with amusing musical numbers & satirical displays of historical artistic license, all of which provides for delightfully licentious entertainment.o an effigy of her father.

She really puts on a great show for her fans and has some really amazing costumes! Everything about the show is perfect; the singing, dancing, props, even the diologue! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because HBO didn't include all the iterludes and they cut some of the songs shorter. This is a must buy for any Lady Gaga fan or anyone who is looking to watch a good concert!

0307887960|2.0|In 2004, I embarked on a journey that took me from 410 pounds on New Year's Day down to 230 pounds by the end of the year. It was the high-fat, moderate protein, low-carb Atkins diet and my life was radically changed for the better. People often asked me if that \\"no carb\\" or \\"high protein\\" diet was the key to my success and my response was always no. \\"It's the fat in my diet that became the fuel for my body in the absence of the gobs of carbohydrates I used to eat,\\" I'd always say. And it's true. When you cut carbs down to ketogenic levels (typically that's under 50g carbohydrates daily), dietary fat becomes the fuel for your body.<br /><br />That's why I was so disappointed as I read THE DUKAN DIET by Dr. Pierre Dukan because it promotes cutting carbs but also dietary fat. While you can certainly lose weight eating this way and I have no doubt there are people who have been successful shedding pounds on this diet, the fact is it is both unsustainable and undesirable. Hunger is inevitable and satiety is next to impossible to attain without adequate fat in your meals. When you reduce carbs, then any supposed health concerns about consuming fat--especially saturated fat--are a non-issue. The fact is you NEED fat in your diet and the extent that you cut it out of your diet following the Dukan plan is much more of a fat than anything Dr. Atkins wrote about in his books.<br /><br />Bottom line: THIS AIN'T ATKINS! I know this book has been marketed as a better Atkins diet (isn't that what they said about The South Beach Diet too?), but it's not even close. There are some really wacky ideas in this book that aren't worth wasting your time on. If you want to follow low-carb, then there are MUCH better books to read:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005OHSD3A The New Atkins for a New You: The Ultimate Diet for Shedding Weight and Feeling Great]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0553380788 Protein Power: The High-Protein/Low-Carbohydrate Way to Lose Weight, Feel Fit, and Boost Your Health--in Just Weeks!]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1402768257 Living Low Carb: Controlled-Carbohydrate Eating for Long-Term Weight Loss]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0983490708 The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living: An Expert Guide to Making the Life-Saving Benefits of Carbohydrate Restriction Sustainable and Enjoyable]]Controlled-Carbohydrate Eating for Long-Term Weight Loss]]  [[ASIN:0983490708 The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living: An Expert Guide to Making the Life-Saving Benefits of Carbohydrate Restriction Sustainable and Enjoyable]]

B004T4F7TW|3.0|What a great album.  Very tallented person who has great respect for the New Orleans sound and has really captured it.  However my review is based on the atributes or lack of, for the vinyl LP (purchased from Amazon)version and this is what I will be talking about.  As a music lover and an audio enthusiest I try to buy most of my music on vinyl.  I have purchased vinyl for many years and have found a fact you must considor.  Modern music is very \\"compressed\\" from the studio.  This is done so it will play loudly on your car stereo or mp3 layer.  Although technology has leaped vastly sometimes such as this to a lack of true quality. This is where the industry has gone.  A sad fact.  Oh well let me get back to my thoughts.  The vinyl is very quiet.  Much better than most of the new releases available today.  Again, the musical content is awesome.  The band is talented no doubt.  However the \\"compression\\" is evident.  No doubt recorded especially fo the digital domain. I was curious so I recorded it from the LP to my Sound Devices digital recorder and viewed the wave file in Audacity and found it to be \\"very compressed\\"!  My advice is to buy the CD.  The vinyl is expensive and really dosent give you any advantage over CD. For more info on compression please refer to this attached link.    [...]  Hope this helps.

B004RC8NXI|3.0|Coming off a highly praised turn in \\"The Black Swan\\", Natalie Portman does an acting 180 in this fairly traditional romantic comedy.  There is certainly nothing new here.  Can platonic friends be sex buddies without all the romantic entanglements?  Yeah, good luck with that.  Portman's character Emma is a medical student working an 80 hour week and looks to a friend she first knew when they were budding teenagers, to provide sexual release.  Adam (Ashton Kutcher) works on a TV series, obviously helped along the way by his famous actor dad played by Kevin Kline.  We certainly know where the movie is going to go, so how much fun is it getting there?  More than we might expect.  Portman and Kutcher work well together and push all the right buttons.  There is no question Portman adds a certain acting legitimacy to what is pretty much a cookie-cutter plot.  The movie is sexy and fun.  What's wrong with that?

B0040QYROK|5.0|After years of search, researchers of this Fritz Lang masterpiece found missing footage in Argentina and created this wonderfully restored 2 ½ hour version that is pretty accurate to what was originally intended.  Most sci-fi fans are well aware of the legacy \\"Metropolis\\" left for future filmmakers.  As a lover of \\"Blade Runner\\", I first became aware of the film years ago and in fact, have 3 other versions including a rare version with a rock soundtrack.  The politics of the film are undeniable as we find the futuristic city of Metropolis inhabited by the workers who build the cities, work to keep them running and stoke the fires that produce the energy needed.  There are others inhabitants.  They are the ones who live the good life, sucking its pleasures and using the resources without giving any thought to others.  Lang's futuristic look is spectacular as was the budget for the day.  The visual designs evoke a beautiful art deco feel.  The acting of course looks ridiculously over the top, not unusual for the time.  The original musical score is updated here by Frank Strobel and the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin.  This is great stuff.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|A really beautiful blu ray concert production. Looks and sounds amazing. I was fortunate to see Adele in Salt Lake City in August and this dvd captures the mood, energy, and charm of her show very well. Seeing Adele live is a real joy and this disc does a great job of transporting the viewer.
B0042L78MG|5.0|I discovered Caro Emerald through Facebook.  Devin Townsend (from the metal band Strapping Young Lad) linked it with the words \\"cool song.\\"  I clicked it and ordered the CD as soon as the song was finished.<br /><br />Describing this CD is quite difficult.  As many others point out, it's a very interesting blend of jazz, swing, pop, and many other varieties of music.  There are no bad tracks on this disc, and I think I'd say I really like or love 10 out of 12 of the songs.  Her voice is amazing, the song composition is very interesting and I love the over all feel.  The musical production is impeccable, and the percussion really stands out (I wish I knew enough about recording/mastering music to explain exactly what I'm hearing!)  I think this album will be in my CD player for at least 2 weeks, and will be a regular part of my rotation.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I took a dull old knife I've had in the garage for years, with dried paint and who knows what else, and put an edge on it.  It took about 4 minutes on the coarse side, and it was sharp already.  I gave it a couple runs on the polish side and it's like a new knife.  Very impressive.  Also the instructions say the sharpening blocks are reversible and replaceable- not sure how often this is neccesary but it's nice to know.  Haven't tried the serrated sharpener but it's a novel idea.

B004EPYZTE|1.0|I have read all of R. E. Howard's work on Conan, and I have read many of the lesser works on Conan, and I have read all of the Dark Horse comics on Conan. I have also seen the movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger (who fit the character). I will say that Conan the Destroyer was a stinker, but this new Conan film takes the cake! Momoa does not fit the character AT ALL! Howard NEVER describes Conan as being \\"dark skinned\\" of looking like some Indian, or black man! The sets in this film remind me of that cheese TV series Xena or Hercules! Hollywood is more interested in special effects and politically correct stupidity than telling a story, but than Hollywood has never followed the books (can you say The Return of the King)! IN short this film is a piece of trash, so don't waste you money, and please God don't let them make a 2nd film! (I wish Amazon would allow negative stars because this P.O.S needs a -5 stars!

B005NF2UE6|4.0|Daughtry and Nickelback released their CD's essentially at the same time. Though Daughtry's new CD offers more tracks, I've got to give the nod to Nickelback on this one. NB's CD is more defined in the writing and music. All of the songs are distinctly different and each one is great. I didn't skip any track as I listened to it. Daughtry's new cd has a lot to offer but many songs sound the same with nothing really standing out. NB has a great follow up with Hear and Now. As a DJ, I'm gonna be able to play 3/4ths of this cd and hope that it catches on with audiences. I've not heard much of this cd on the radio and that isn't good. If we get some radio play maybe there will be classics on this that will take some of the popularity of Animal and Photograph on the request list.

I was worried that some parts might be \\"scarry\\" and although there are some intense moments/faces scattered throughout (especially at the end) for the most part it's pretty calm. For sure a Diney Classic!

Have been following Oasis, Noel & Liam for several years now.<br />It's always a challenge to meet the high expectations that come from being the lead man from such a great band as Oasis.<br />Well Noel hasn't disappointed me. Looking forward to see him perform these songs live.<br />PS: I think Noel has a very pleasant voice that fits these melodic songs well.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downtown Abbey is a period piece masterpiece, the sort of rare treasure I could find myself watching all day while curled up in a woolly blanket. It's like comfort food for the soul. It is witty, well-acted and totally absorbing. Fans of period movies will undoubtedly love it. If you find it is a bit slow at the start, stay with it. My sister was complaining at the beginning but she ended up loving it

1400069181|5.0|Recently, I applied to TOMS \\" Books For Bloggers Program\\" and was selected to read Blake Mycoskie's new book, \\"Start Something That Matters\\", give my review, and then give a copy away!<br />For those of you who don't know about TOMS(which I assume is few), it is a company whose motto is; One For One. They give a pair of shoes to a child in need, for every pair of shoes that is purchased. They now, also do the same with their sunglasses and books.<br />I personally, spotted TOMS a little over 4 years ago at a local store. I was drawn to the simple, yet trendy, style of the shoes- back then they only had a few options of colors. Once I found out what they actually were and realized I could be helping a child in need for purchasing them, I knew I had to have some. My husband ended up buying me my first pair for my birthday and have bought multiple pairs since then, as they now how many style of shoes and designs to choose from. I have been so inspired with the story of TOMS and what Blake has started, that is why I am honored to review his book and spread the word about the movement he's created. Blake took a simple idea, to help others in need, and has changed the world and lives of many. Its fabulous to have watched how far the company has come in just 5 years!All I can say is that this book is seriously SO Inspiring and informative. Its a book for dreamers and go-getters! YOU can do something that matters in the world and this book gives great advice on how to get out there and accomplish your hopes, step by step. Its also very fascinating to find out details of how TOMS got started! and learn little facts like, why he even calls it TOMS-and no its not the founders name, like tons of people think:). I'm telling you this book can be life changing. If Blake can do something to make a difference in the world, why can't each of us?<br /><br />So go ahead, leave a comment on my blog,[...] on why you should receive a free copy of his book to learn how you can make a difference in the world too!<br />The deadline to enter will be Midnight of December 16th and I will pick the winner on the December 17th. So spread the word!<br />Hope you win!!!! and enjoyed my little TOMS photo shoot :)too!   The deadline to enter will be Midnight of December 16th and I will pick the winner on the December 17th.

B005NF2UE6|5.0|The people who complain about this album are obviously not true Nickelback fans. period. They bring back the feel of the old (for those of us who actually listen to old NB) albums. then in the last 4 or 5 songs they blend in a few of the newer sounding songs giving that dark horse kind of feel. overall a well rounded album that delivers a lot more than promised, and that says something because any new NB album promises A LOT!  So if you don't have anything worth saying please don't say it. The album is worth every cent!
1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson was personally selected by Steve Jobs to write his story.  It's just another decision that Jobs made during his lifetime that was sheer genius.  Unlike many of his other decisions, Jobs agreed not to interfere or meddle in the production, totally out of character, but the result is a classic.  Isaacson has taken a totally neutral approach at portraying Jobs, with his creative mind and personal frailties on full display.  Jobs never told the author what to write, good or bad.  His answer to all events portrayed was, \\"It's simply who I am.\\"  Who was Steve Jobs?  He was an adopted child who had, for the most part an uneventful and normal childhood.  He was not curious about his biological parents, and lovingly bonded with his adoptive parents who made him feel \\"special.\\"  One early characteristic Jobs displayed was his unwillingness to accept authority.  His curiosity about all things encountered was unbounded, leading to boredom with his early schooling which failed to challenge his intellect.  So he often got into trouble and always displayed a rebellious nature.  These shortcomings, if they could be considered that, carried over into his adult life and were credited with contributing to his abrasive personality, manic attention to detail, and incredible sensitivity.  As an adult he would cry at the slightest situation that wounded him.  He could also publicly lash out at an associate with ferocity and obscenities that would stun all in attendance, and leave his coworker crushed.  His own sensitivity allowed him to know how to effectively hurt someone, and he did so often.  He would celebrate successes with an almost boyish joy - although, frequently, the person most responsible for the accomplishment would be forgotten in the jubilation.  That said, his genius at visualizing what needed to be sent to the electronic marketplace has never been equaled.  The ultimate technocrat title belongs to him.  Other giants in the computer world still tend to belittle his paranoia about miniscule details:  of course Apple products outsell all others by a large margin.  His negotiating skills, frequently accompanied by shady promises and broken arrangements, are outlined in captivating detail by Isaacson.  The main figures in these deals, considered industry giants in their own right, would fall victim to Jobs's maneuvers over and over, leaving them lighter in their wallets while Jobs fattened his.  In the beginning he never cared much for money.  However, his demands grew over time, and he eventually became one of the richest men in the world.  But he still preferred simplicity, in both his products and his life.  His creations were sleek, modern, and austere in both design and appearance, although expensive in their manufacturing complexity.  His life was long walks, vegan food, simple clothing, and sparsely furnished home and office.  Later in life he began to enjoy the results of having money, although he never really changed his down-home lifestyle.  Isaacson's writing is truly magnificent.  He recreates life in a world of excruciating complexity with clarity and comprehension.  Tangled personal relationships and complicated industry manipulations are reduced to readable prose with enough detail to lead the reader into many aha! moments.  The story is deftly paced to keep the reader engrossed throughout the lengthy book.    Good writing leaves readers with impressions.  Isaacson left me with this: My impression of Jobs is that of a gangly hippie huckster who liked show-and-tells.  He could assemble an attractive jigsaw puzzle from pieces that didn't fit and colors that didn't match.  He would then carry it around on a teetering board to show everyone, the puzzle sliding from side to side and threatening to cascade off the edge at any moment.  Then he'd sell it to them, as I hope I've sold this book to you.

B004LWZVZC|1.0|In a court of law, Redford wouldn't be convicted of exactly rewriting history, but he is guilty of a more refined crime... re-proportioning events to change the perception of history - thus rewriting history, in effect. The conspirators were, in fact, all guilty. A great place to start learning about the conspirators is James L. Swanson's illustrated history, [[ASIN:0061237620 Lincoln's Assassins: Their Trial and Execution]].<br /><br />Mary Surratt WAS, in fact, accorded due process... the due process of 1865!<br /><br />I'm constantly amazed that people of today fail to see the simple fact that the due process, or ANY thinking, for that matter was different 147 years ago than that of today. We've come a long way since then, and it is a huge mistake to overlay 21st century morality on people of another time. They were product of their world and experiences, just as we are product of ours.<br /><br />It is just that simple.
B004XWLN20|3.0|I'm a huge SV fan. Been one since about season two. And I wanted this awesome-looking collector's set so badly that I sold my seasons one through nine, some textbooks, etc. just to have money for it.<br /><br />In the long run, I kind of regret doing that.<br /><br />Here's the short version: If you already own seasons one through nine, do yourself a favor and just buy season ten. This big set, unfortunately, is not worth it.<br /><br />Here's the long version: While the set looks beautiful, it's not practical. Each DVD is tightly (and I mean TIGHTLY) held in place by cardboard dividers. You literally have to pry out some of the DVDs from between two slats of cardboard. Obviously, this leaves some pretty heavy scratches. One of my DVDs looks like I set it on the floor, put my foot on top of it, and did the hokey pokey. The fronts of the DVDs look great, each season represented by a different Kryptonian symbol that die-hard fans will recognize. However, the DVDs are packed SO TIGHTLY that, sometimes, the symbols (and even the big shiny silver disc numbers) are rubbed off. This only happened to a couple of my discs, but it was sad to see.<br /><br />Another thing I'm disappointed by: Despite the cool new look of these DVDs, they are the SAME DVDs from the previous sets. Same menu layout, same opening montage, everything. I thought we'd get something a little more fresh, but I was wrong.<br /><br />The big books which hold the DVDs are neat, but their coolness only lasts as long as it takes for you to look at each panel. Same goes for the production notes and newspaper. They're really nice, but they don't make up for the horrible disc storage. I decided to store my Smallville DVDs in a DVD binder so that I never have to subject them to cardboard ever again.<br /><br />And the special features... leave much to be desired. I was really looking forward to some insights and information that I had never heard before. What was it like making the show? What were some of the biggest challenges? What kinds of things did DC prevent the producers from doing? Audition tapes, script changes, etc.<br /><br />At first, it seems the retrospective might go in that direction. But the more you watch it, the more you realize that this is really a look back on the different plot points in the show. The actors really say very little. Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson basically run down memory lane, discussing almost every plot element season by season, except (of course) the really bad ones (Super Lana, anyone?).<br /><br />To summarize, it's nice to have these special features and the really cool box set, but the best features are actually packaged with the seasons themselves. In the long run, you're spending two hundred bucks for a set of cardboard boxes, a cheesy newspaper, and documentaries with about as much information as those CW web videos.<br /><br />Sadly, Smallville: The Complete Series is not so super after all.iggest challenges?

0380778556|5.0|Daphne du Maurier walks the tightrope between popular fiction and literature, between the 19th and 20th centuries, and comes out on top in \\"Rebecca.\\"<br />\<br /><br />Shy, intelligent, sensitive orphan girl working unhappily as a servant meets and marries a fabulously wealthy older man and moves to his windswept English country estate where something sinister lurks . . . sounds like something you've read before, doesn't it? The joy of \\"Rebecca\\" lies not in the tale (though it has its surprises) but in the telling. The best way I can describe it is as a symphony of words, starting dissonant, then softening, then gradually building to a driving crescendo and an explosive ending.<br /><br />Readers who demand incessant page-turning action will find Rebecca to be slow going, especially in the beginning--really, that many paragraphs about a driveway? More patient readers will luxuriate in DuMaurier's painterly descriptions that reflect her love of English country life and carefully reveal plot and character. Mrs. Danvers, one of fiction's great villains, will send chills down your spine as she plagues the nameless narrator known only as \\"the second Mrs. de Winter.\\"<br /><br />\\"Rebecca\\" is one of those books where if you don't like it, you don't like it, but if you do, it's bound to become a favorite you will read again and again.
B000W91RUG|5.0|First and foremost, I must admit that I am not a TV person nor do I like many TV shows.  I find most of the comedy or the intrigue of them palsy and drab, a mere ruse to keep you intertwined with something other than your life for a half hour or hour.  That being said, I am not completely adverse to them.  I do find some intriguing, sometimes funny, and of interest.  I first turned my eyes on The Big Bang Theory when my mother was watching an episode.  It was just one of the many jokes in the show and I happened to get a chuckle from it.  The next time I saw it on I decided to watch a full episode and I found myself delighted by this tour de force of American comedy.<br /><br />The first season unfolds with a typical American heartache story: the girl next door and the boy that can hardly talk to her let alone express his interest in her.  That girl is Penny and that boy is Leonard.  Penny is your typical young woman, striking it out on her own, struggling to make ends meet, but otherwise takes enjoyment in going out with her girlfriends, looking pretty, and dating men as shallow as a gutter stream.  Leonard, on the other hand, is your typical geek.  He's a physicist and extremely intelligent and while Penny glorifies in her social realm, Leonard is more content to play video games and discuss abstract theory.  He starts on his own quest to seek to be with Penny even when he knows he's starting from the very bottom.<br /><br />Along with Penny and Leonard we have three other main characters: Sheldon, Radj, and Howard (also named Wolowitz for his last name).  The three men are more in Leonard's category, that of the geeky physicist.  Sheldon is so emotionally detached from proper human decorum that he can't pick up on even the slightest things, like sarcasm, but he is also the fulcrum to much of the comedy in the show.  His dry, sensible nature acts as a stark counterpoint to all of the other characters and the actor who plays him is simply superb.  Radj provides the ethnic character who can't talk to women unless he is drunk.  Howard is an overtly, but funny, creep who depends on suave debonaire to try to get whatever he can out of any woman he meets.<br /><br />The humor, and perfect genius, of the series is not just in the surface of the show.  Anyone can watch this show, but the geeks of the world take a particular enjoyment out of it considering the amount of nerd-jokes that circulate throughout each episode.  That deeper meaning might be lost on a layman who has never played a video game or researched scientific principles in their life, but it's either explained of quickly written next to a joke that can be understood.  It flows seamlessly and the actors are simply phenomenal.  A joy to watch for anyone with even the slightest touch of a funny bone.ho can't talk to women unless he is drunk.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|This was an amazingly entertaining book. Michael Lewis has a great ability to weave multiple stories about arcane financial deals into a book that makes you search for ways to fit in more reading time at the expense of other activities. It has the right mix of difficult concepts and basic human drama. There are good guys, plucky underdogs, complacent and corrupt bad guys. It's timely and will continue to fascinate people once we are removed from this crisis.   However: It vastly oversimplifies things. It leaves out major players or events. The world seems so clear and comprehensible when it's actually messy and confusing. While I think the general message is correct, the certainty with which the book delivers it is an illusion. If you aren't careful, you'll become an insufferable know-it-all at a party when the conversation drifts to finance or the housing crisis. Don't use this book alone to draw grand, sweeping conclusions about the financial collapse.   I recommend this book, but it's important to remember that the world is a much more complicated place than Lewis paints it to be.

B000077VR3|2.0|The editing is fast-paced and that's not a good thing. Maybe in a music video,it would work but not here. The writing is terrible at best. 99.9% of the story makes little-to-no sense. Even WCW during it's dying years made more sense then this film. Half of the cast is either dumb or unlikable. It uses copyrighted songs and tries to make them thier own with little success. 99.9% of the acting is very over-the-top to the 5th power. The goodsides are that the settings are stylish,songs are pretty good and the dance numbers are fun to watch. I give this film a 3 out of 10.

125000568X|3.0|The book has tons of never before seen pictures and all sorts of memorabilia (inlays, posters, newspaper articles, tickets, handwritten song lyrics atc.)  The bad thing is that the publisher obviously decided to spend less money by making the book appearance simplier than it was supposed to be.   Please, take into account that, unlike British, american edition comes without audio interview CD and cardboard slipcase. In addition book's spine is strangely wider (like 1/4 of an inch) than the book itself. You should really consider buying British version to have such a great item in truly collector's form.

So much so that he read the book in a couple of hours.  I could not believe it.  He was thirsting for more and decided to re-read the book.  Great buy.  Great read.  Great book.

031262820X|5.0|THE WEDDING GIRL is an amazing book!  There is so much going on inside the pages and it is never dull.  Milly is getting married to the man she truly loves -- millionaire, Simon -- and everything seems perfect.  Except there's one little hitch. Milly is already hitched.  All the characters in this book are neatly fleshed out and (most) are truly likable.  The tragic Rupert brings a bit of poignancy to the narration and his sad story is deeply moving.  Simon's father, Allan, is clever and adds some very funny dry humour.  All the relationships are realistic and therefore believable.  It's easy to care about the characters in the book and what happens to them.  There are several plot twists and turns that are surprising and quite a lot of suspense. I highly recommend this book!

B002VPE1XE|5.0|I picked this up on a lightning deal, hoping for something to protect my [[ASIN:B005JRIKJC Olympus PEN E-PM1]]. I wasn't sure it would fit - but, with the right lens, it does!  The PM1 kit lens will *not* fit, but there are several micro 4/3 lenses that should: the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7, the Panasonic 14mm f/2.5, the Olympus 17mm f/2.8, and (just barely) the Olympus 45mm f/1.8. For the 45mm to fit, the camera must be turned *sideways* in the case.  The quality of this item is quite good. The velcro may not be the strongest, but it's adequate. For the price, you won't beat it!

B001N1DPDE|4.0|I bought 3 knives for Christmas presents:  Becker BK2, Ontario RAT5 and an ESSE4.  This knife is by far the heaviest.  On the plus side:  best price, angle ground blade (helps in batoning), nice sheath.  With the addition of aftermarket micarta scales, the knife is relatively slip proof.  On the down side:  This is a beast and while useful for most heavy duty chopping and camp cutting duties, it is massive, to the point of overkill. The standard grivory scales are slippery when wet.  There is no choil cut for more delicate cutting.  If used as a survival tool, I would have expected a wire breaker/cutter.

B006FE17Q6|5.0|Okay, I'll admit, i hate the idea of mid season finales's. Let's just keep this thing going. However, from a marketing standpoint, i'm sure it serves to maintain long term interest.<br />Anyway, this episode delved deeper into Hershel's psyche and explores his fears and relationaships. It also shows Shane's descent into what can only be described as fearful despotism (at least, that is how i see it heading).<br />This is the episode where everybody finally finds out about the walkers in the barn.<br />To me, this was the most intense episode to date. Such strong emotions and relationships, both good and bad, have developed and are pretty much at the point of no return.<br />Also, we finally learn what happened to little Sophia (although we suspected all along). You might cry.<br />Great episode!<br />Enjoy!

B002ZG993Q|2.0|This movie should air on The Travel Channel.  It's very clean and everything is just so and Clooney keeps getting this very fresh haircut and doing sit-ups and the pseudo-sophisticated ladies will love it and the men will get to see some shooting and there's nice vistas and then it is over.  For a movie star, Clooney has made shockingly few great films, as a leading man or director.  This one is like bad Bullit.  Anton Corbjin makes quiet, good looking, hollow movies that feel like the celeb photog and music video guy he is.
B000I186FW|5.0|What a fantastic movie!  I saw this movie days ago but it's still on my mind.  Excellent film. Very deep and exciting.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|It's pretty much a bunch of cartoon versions of dead legends talking to a thin sketch of a character who has a cartoonishly obnoxious gal pal(Rachel Mcadams.)  But for some reason the movie gets into that easy going flow where one just goes along with it.  Owen Wilson is a big part of this.  The combination of his laid-back depression with Woody's neurotic depression works very well.  Aside from that, it's similar to watching Nancy Myers' Something Gotta Give... Excellent Fluff.
1451648537|5.0|An extraordinary read-a book for the ages.  Connotes a clear message of the power of an innovator to will his ideas upon others.

B003E6K1VK|5.0|Great product!  It performs well above my expectations.  I bought this purposely to use  as an external sound card for my computer.    My review is strictly on that basis so currently I know nothing  about how the headphone amp performs.  I bought the external adapter (L7 Line Out Dock (LOD)) which bypasses the headphone amp and allows you to use only the DAC.  Currently, I have powered computer speakers which are plugged directly into the adapter and all I can say is WOW!  PLEASE NOTE: these are my recommendations or experience and what I believe...your mileage may vary.  1. Don't use anything less then very good speakers if you are using the DAC out/only.  Your speakers don't need to  have the lowest bass, however, they do need to be articulate and refined in the midrange/treble region.  2. Make sure you have configured the computer/software/soundcard. Generally it's plug and play in Windows but if using Linux/Ubuntu you will need to make adjustments to enable the USB DAC.   3. If using Windows, make sure you are using an audiophile player such as Foobar, etc.  If you are truely savvy and want to improve on Foobar...try Daum PotPlayer (32-bit) and install ReClock in addition.  It's the best I've heard in Windows at present.  If using Linux/Ubuntu, the default (music/video) players sound excellent once configured. Currently I'm using Lubuntu, a derivative of Ubuntu and it's truly shines beyond MS OS for audio reproduction if music/video matters to you.  CONCLUSION: the best bang for quality/cost/and least effort is buying the USB DAC/LOC adapter and using an external amp or powered loudspeakers.  Linux/Lubuntu sounds best hands down for audio without having to do additional tweaks in Windows.  P.S.   So far I noticed I could not play high res music files in Windows, however, in Linux/Lubuntu I've had no problem.  There still may be settings I need to adjust but was not able to find them as of this writing.  I'm not sure if there is a setting to allow the USB DAC topower off completely when the computer shuts down.  This requires a manual power off, but, it may be best just to leave on (for sound quality) considering it recharges when in use.  Cheers!

B005L3HJ8M|4.0|A little over ten years ago, British band Coldplay were on everyone's next to watch list. They debuted in 2000 with their album \\"Parachutes\\" with the songs \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Trouble\\". Two years later, they followed it up with their sophomore smash \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\"- an album that was deemed an instant classic and topped almost everyone's \\"Album Of The Year\\" lists. A few years had passed when they released their third album \\"X&Y\\", a record that seemed to meander throughout and recieved mixed reviews in the press. In 2008, they teamed up with legendary producer Brian Eno for their best recording to date- \\"Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends\\". Now in 2011, they have returned with their fifth album \\"Mylo Xyloto\\"- an album that continues down the path of \\"Viva La Vida...\\", only this time they decide to experiment more with electronic based sounds. Joining them on this album for production are Markus Dravs and Rik Simpson (The co-producers of \\"Viva La Vida...\\") and mixing engineer Daniel Green with assistance from Brian Eno.<br /><br />Although their album is listed as having fourteen songs, it's really ten songs with four interludes: The title track \\"Mylo Xyloto\\", \\"M.M.I.X.\\", \\"UFO\\" and \\"A Hopeful Transmission\\". They lead the album off with the uptempo \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" leading into the synth heavy \\"Paradise\\". The track \\"Charlie Brown\\" is eerily reminiscent of the song \\"Viva La Vida\\", while they channel their early sound on the ballad \\"Us Against The World\\". On \\"Major Minus\\" they create a song that bears resemblance to the Rolling Stones' \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", and get vocal assistance from pop singer Rihanna on the noticeably poppy \\"Princess Of China\\". On the piano driven breakup ballad \\"Up In Flames\\", they use an 808 drum machine- one of the rare times it's used on a rock record. They get into full-on rock mode on \\"Don't Let It Get To Your Heart\\" and close the album out with the brief ballad \\"Up With The Birds\\". While \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is a good record, it's not the best in their catalogue. At any rate, the sonic experiments on the album could have been trimmed back a little- being that they subtract from the songs as opposed to adding to them. However, it's still a strong recording from Chris Martin and company.he best in their catalogue.

0345529057|3.0|The writing is phenomenal, the delivery service is next day but the quality of this edition is unspeakable. The binding is flimsy, the paper is gray and the font is small and ugly. Looks like it was created to slap me in the face as much as to cut production costs.
B004WR125O|4.0|The item works well, I had a little trouble at first pairing it with my Onkyo HT-9400 at first, but with a couple reboots of the receiver, it was finally able to pair.

Overall, its a great device and works well!

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Race Against The Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee is a very interesting little book about the \\"shape of things to come\\". The authors, a pair of MIT Sloan Business School profs have examined the way technology is impacting American business and how that impact has affected distribution of economic output and come to some rather startling conclusions about the future of the American labor market. They've also taken a stab a providing some potential ways to address the issues.<br /><br />On the first point, the way technology impacts business and the labor market, they seem to make a very compelling case. As technology and computing power becomes ever less expensive and more capable, firms will continue to substitute capital investment for labor. First Jobs that used to be done by un and low-skilled workers were replaced by simple, single use robots (think car factories). Next, workers in skilled clerical occupations were replaced (think ATMs replacing bank tellers and computer software replacing \\"book-keepers\\"). Now even jobs that looked safe such as drivers and journalists are in danger of replacement by technology.<br /><br />The second point, that the increasing utilization of capital expenditure to replace labor has changed income distribution is pretty well indisputable. The skew in income distribution is continuing to increase towards those with access to capital.<br />The authors do give, in one chapter, 19 recommendations to address the issues raised in the rest of the book. The recommendations mostly involved increased government intervention in the form of things like enhancing educational opportunities, creating a new class of \\"founder's visas\\" for those who want to come here and start businesses and investment in infrastructure. The recommendations seem well thought out and credible.<br /><br />I recommend the book to anyone who's trying to figure out what the hell is going on.book to anyone who's trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|11/22/63 is King's latest tome. Basically there is a \\"time portal\\" in the storage room of a local diner that instantly transports whoever uses it back in time. The user always emerges at exactly the same date and time, 11:30 in the morning, on specific date in October 1958. And when the user returns to \\"out time\\" it is always 2 minutes after he left. Interestingly, time travelers can alter subsequent events, and when they return to the current time the downstream ramifications of those changes still exist. However, every time the portal is used the system \\"resets\\" as it were and starts over. Anyway, the idea is to use the time portal to go back in time to stop Oswald from killing Kennedy, which of course, means the traveler has to hang out from 1958 to 1963 waiting on Oswald.<br /><br />The book was very well conceived. King has obviously done quite a bit of thinking about the ramifications of his construct and does a good job of keeping it internally consistent. King also does a decent job of examining at least one set of possible consequences of Kennedy's survival. The book is, in the context of its milieu, plausible.<br /><br />The particular strength of the book is that King has done a really good job reminding us (or telling those of you who don't remember) just how much different everyday life was in America 50 years ago.  My memories of events external to my family begin in the fall of 1965, a time not too far removed from the events described in this book, and I can recall many of the features of everyday life King describes here. He does a great job of capturing the \\"zeitgeist\\" of both American in general and small-town life in particular, in the late 50s and early 60s. Anyway, I enjoyed the book immensely and recommend it highly.

I have heard quite a few popular artists have their work interpreted by an orchestra and it always ends up souding like Muzak. This is NOT like that at all. I can hear the effort put into each piece of work. I have only one complaint : I did not like Ane Brun - especially on Don't Give Up. Her's is neither a beautiful nor powerful voice. Other than that, I love this CD.

0385344325|2.0|I have read most of the Reacher novels. This has got to be one of the worst. The story is tedious and drags on at a snail's pace. What action there is is pretty limited. How many pages can you use to describe the Mississippi countryside? The plot twists are not bad but could have been handled in a 100 page book. I have begun to wonder whether Lee Child, like other \\"hit\\" authors is using an \\"assistant\\". Several of the same supporting characters as appear in other Reacher stories. Mostly in just bit appearances.   All in all, not up to the earlier Reacher books. I guess the best descriptor is \\"much less intense\\".
