B007SZ0E1K|5.0|So brief backstory, I was in need of upgrade, my last machine was a Phenom 965 BE, 16gb of ram, i work with alot of VM's and even with all that ram it still chugged when i fired up my 4th VM...Enter the i5 3570k =D<br /><br />I love this processor so far, i'm still on stock speeds currently, same ram and the machine handles 4 VMs without problem. I like a queit machine and the cooling fan on this is just that, SILENT... installation was a breeze and i am thoroughly suprised by the HD4000, i'm actually able to play skyrim on 1080p low settings which of course by most standards is poor but for an \\"onboard\\" this really made me smile, i even played BF3 a little. This is a very good purchase for anyone, save the bucks and go for this instead of ah 3770k, I've seen 3570k's hit 4.5ghz using large air coolers, so i'd recommend the Noctua NH-D14 if your going extreme overclocking. definitely cant go wrong with this CPU.

0345803485|1.0|First of all, let me say that I hate that expression, but it is the only way I can describe this book (and it is used hundreds of time in the book).  How it ever made the best seller list is beyond me.  If not for the subject matter, I would have thought that it was written by a 13 year old.  I cannot read another page.

B005LAII1C|4.0|MOVIE REVIEW #40: \\" Ted \\"<br /><br />Like most films these days, this films only real downside is it's \\"R\\" rating. Justifiably so - due to the language, sexual innuendos and drug related humor - however - (and also other than this film moving a tiny bit slow in the middle - pace wise) - it was very funny and quite `real' for me. And, surprisingly it had a really big - slightly tear-jerking heart at the end of it all.<br /><br />Writers Alec Sulkin (Family Guy, The Cleveland Show) Wellesley Wild (Family Guy) and Seth McFarlane (Creator of Family Guy, The Cleveland Show) all set out to do one thing in my opinion - make something that is completely a fantasy - seem completely real. They succeeded in a most hysterical way.<br /><br />The story tells the tale that back in 1985, as a young boy, John Bennett played spot-on by Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, The Fighter), who wanted nothing more than for his beloved teddy bear Ted (MacFarlane) to come to life. Incredibly, that wish was granted. But now that John grown up, his boyhood dream has become a nightmare nuisance. The plot has everything going for it -  including the passionate Mila Kunis (Black Swan, That 70's Show) playing his girlfriend convincing him that growing up is part of life and even, Joel McHale (Spider-man, Community) as Mila's overly sexed boss trying to get her to loose Wahlberg as a boyfriend - to even the hysterically psychotic Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar, Saving Private Ryan) who is stalking John and wants that Teddy Bear for himself and his not so normal son!<br /><br />A real fun and nostalgic moment occurs when John and Ted meet their long-term childhood idol, former US Marine turned actor - Sam J. Jones (actually playing himself from the 1979 movie classic Flash Gordon) - who turns up in some drug induced fantasy sequence. The audience was bursting in laughter (and rock group Queen's original music too)!<br /><br />The film has, action, suspense and just a little too much drama in the middle - but the comedy, slapstick style humor and witty dialogue keep you laughing out loud throughout the movie! Even then un-credited, but familiar, voice of Patrick Stewart (Star Trek:TNG, Excalibur), narrates the film at the beginning and end using a few hysterically chosen quips and words himself.<br /><br />A few other cameos include; Patrick Warburton (How I Met Your Mother, Hercules) as Johns workmate, Ryan Reynolds (The Green Lantern, The Proposal) as - you'll have to see it to know this, Tom Skerritt (Tom Gun, Alien) as the many time mentioned `friend' of everyone appparently and singer/songwriter Nora Jones herself (Made in Manhattan, Love Actually) as herself helping John express his love to Mila.<br /><br />Finally I must applaud director Seth McFarlane for doing bolding what he does best, taking a satirical look at real life and commenting on the various things we all think about - but don't say out loud as much as we would like to. From celebrities to religion - nothing is off limits or sacred and almost everything is off-color. But it is fun and funny.<br /><br />The best surprise and unexpectedly, what that by the end of the film - McFarlane pulls yours heart string - and does it very effectively. This film is definitely not for children - but if you enjoy The Family Guy, Simpsons and American Dad type of humor - you'll love this one! I do - and I did!e comedy, slapstick style humor and witty dialogue keep you laughing out loud throughout the movie!

0345803507|4.0|And here we are. I've finally finished this infamous trilogy and I have to say, I'm very pleased with how things were ended. In previous reviews for both Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker, I was addicted to the sereis amid some confusion on my part. Why do I even like these Twilight-y and raunchy books? I don't really have an answer to that question but I do know that I really enjoyed Fifty Shades Freed and I find myself content and all mushy inside after finishing it.<br /><br />Honestly, what synopses can I give for this finale without ruining both books one and two? Through out this book, Anastasia and Christian contend to fight and work out their relationship. Who ever said love was easy? Especially when you love a billionaire, with an intimacy phobia and has an obcession with BDSM... It seems that the worst of their problems may not be their stubbornness and sexual tenancies. There are threats to their lives that are out of their control and Ana must take it into her own hands to make her relationship work and to save the lives of those she loves.<br /><br />In this one, I really fell in love with Christian. He still had his twitchy palm moments that made me question my love, but overall I fell head over heals. There was more of a vulnerability to him in Freed than the other two stories and it was hard not to find his innocence and troubled soul endearing. Ana also kicked some butt in this one, quite literally. She came into her own in this book and not only stood up to her enemies, but found a way to stand up to Christian as well.<br /><br />While these books are not expertly written, I got past that in book three and was constantly smiling at Ana and Grey's constant witty banter via email and it had me wishing I had my own kinky Mr. Grey to email while I'm working. A girl can dream right? I also enjoyed how James skimmed through certain scenes in the book. There were not as many nonsense, overly explained scenes and that helped the book move along at a better pace, which I liked better than the other books.<br /><br />This book read more like a typical romance novel that I'm used to reading a la Robyn Carr and Sandra Brown, but with a little more of a modern twist and of course, a lot more kinky. It was refreshing and I read Freed in two sittings.<br /><br />While the book was pretty predictable at times (Twilight part deux), I couldn't help enjoy this read. I was invested in their fifty shades of !#$%ed up relationship and I couldn't wait to see them happy. If you've started Fifty Shades of Grey, keep reading to get to Fifty Shades Freed. It's worth the read with all it's cheesy lines, lovey-dovey plot and the kinky. Who knew a book like this could make me get all sentimental?<br /><br />7 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading!<br /><br />Laters ;)<br /><br />Allison<br />imabibliophobic.blogspot.comat a better pace, which I liked better than the other books.<br /><br />This book read more like a typical romance novel that I'm used to reading a la Robyn Carr and Sandra Brown, but with a little more of a modern twist and of course, a lot more kinky.

B005F96URI|3.0|This is set somewhen in a dystopian future. In a world where guns have been outlawed, a mysterious cowboy (Josh Hartnett) with unknown purpose drifts into a lawless town. In an era that claims the sword as the weapon of choice, the samurai Yoshi (Gackt) is tasked with an errand of honor and arrives at that same godforsaken place. Both parties end up at the Horseless Horseman Saloon where the canny Bartender (Woody Harrelson) plies his trade, dispensing equal doses of whiskey and advice. The samurai Yoshi and Hartnett's stranger - who packs no heat and makes do with his lightning-quick fists - have beef with the town's badass gang lord Nicola the Woodcutter (Ron Perlman).<br /><br />Nicola the Woodcutter commands a horde of red-shirted henchmen, as well as a cadre of elite bodyguards and enforcers designated as Killers #2 thru #10, with these death dealers always vying against each other to rise up in numerical rank. Nicola is, of course, Killer #1. Nicola is so arrogant he allows the townspeople constant opportunity to challenge his proxy in death duels for town supremacy. His proxy, the anonymous Killer #2 (Kevin McKidd), may look like a dandy, but he regularly takes on twenty opponents at the same time and effortlessly carves them up. Killer #2, elegant and graceful, comes off like a sadistic John Steed or - and how's this imagery? - a murderous Fred Astaire.<br /><br />1972's RED SUN, which featured Charles Bronson and Toshirô Mifune, did it already and probably did it better, the mashing up of the samurai film and the spaghetti western. But BUNRAKU also introduces a sci-fi element, although that's more relegated to the backdrop, there just to establish the premise.<br /><br />Bunraku, defined, is a form of traditional Japanese puppet theatre. Accordingly, whereas RED SUN had down-to-earth grit, this film espouses a deliberately staged and artificial look, borrowing some from the highly stylized sensibility of SIN CITY, or as the Bartender is wont to label SIN CITY's genre: \\"pop up funnies.\\" It is technically superb and visually tremendous, but don't be surprised should you sense an emptiness in the narrative. None of the characters felt real. The cowboy stranger gets the archetypal treatment but isn't given much depth or dimension. The cowboy specializes in launching mighty haymakers and the samurai seeks the perfection of jin, the toughest of the Bushido codes to master - and those seem to count heavily as the primary character notes. Near the end, though, the samurai does undergo a fairly fundamental shift in his warrior's credo; it's the only way he could've bested his opponent. The exaggerated dialogue doesn't help things. But I did like Faith No More's frontman Mike Patton's voiceover narration. Patton, leisurely and pseudo-philosophical in his musings, sets the tone early on.<br /><br />I also think it's cool that Josh Hartnett visually channels Kurt Russell circa TOMBSTONE. It lends him a harder, more weathered look.<br /><br />Demi Moore is here, playing Ron Perlman's reluctant lady, but she's not the reason to see this bizarre hybrid film. Instead, see BUNRAKU for the colorful visuals, the heightened sensibility, those off-kilter beats, and the boffo, over-the-top action scenes. The samurai Yoshi also has a cousin who is really cute, even if when she tries to use martial arts, she just ends up looking silly.<br /><br />And, as always, it's never good to be a Red Shirt.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars for BUNRAKU.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary by director Guy Moshe and actor Kevin McKidd<br />- Theatrical TrailerTY's genre: \\"pop up funnies.\\" It is technically superb and visually tremendous, but don't be surprised should you sense an emptiness in the narrative.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|I purchased this case along with the Kindle for a mother's day gift and it was the best choice possible. She carries with her everywhere she goes, out to the store, around the house, etc. It works perfect because it protects the screen from getting scratched up from her keys or whatever is in her purse from time to time. The case also doubling as a stand is a big plus when you want to watch videos or playing a game and you don't wanna hold it for a while. I would suggest this to anyone who has a Kindle or is thinking about purchasing a Kindle in the future.

0307956350|4.0|The novel starts with a short Prelude that grabbed me into the story and didn't let go until the final word.  I couldn't have stopped reading even had I wanted to.  Mulitiple passports, rolls of cash  and a gun, all signs of a family that's been on the run.<br /><br />We soon learn that Kate Moore is ex-CIA, is there really such a thing as leaving the CIA while still alive, and she has moved to Luxembourg when her husband Dexter was transferred there to a prestigious position in security. She  has talked herself into believing that she is ready for a normal life of being a wife and mother to her two small children.  It can't be that hard to socialize with the other expat wives.  At least she believes this until she starts to suspect her new friends Julia and Bill of being much more than they appear.  She is convinced that they are watching her and Dexter, but can't imagine why.<br /><br />Is Kate paranoid or should she be worried.  And who should she be worried about.<br /><br />While I was reading, I could hardly put the book down.  I carried it around the house with me and continued to read every chance I had.  I was fascinated with Kate's life and how she was dealing with all the change in her life.  Not only did she quit her job, but she moved countries and had to settle into a totally different lifestyle.  Everyday she met with expats from many countries; could she trust these women or were they being her friend for very different reasons.<br /><br />I really had no feeling or connection with Dexter.  All the way through the book, he was a mystery to me.  Bill was much the same. I couldn't have cared less if anything had happened to these men.  Julia I could have almost liked, but she seemed rather elusive when it came to the  details, and it's always in the details when deciding whether I like a person.<br /><br />The plot lines kept me guessing the entire book.  I wasn't able to outguess the author at any time.  Very promising for a debut novel.  I'll be looking forward to future books by Chris Pavone.ing forward to future books by Chris Pavone.

030771652X|3.0|I recently read and enjoyed Afterwards, Rosamund Lupton's newest novel, so I was excited to read her well-reviewed, debut mystery. The style is unique but I came to like the first person narrator who is telling the story to her dead sister. The plot is evenly paced, thrilling and I really could not put it down.<br /><br />However, much like other novels, where the reader discovers that most of the story is untrue (i.e. The Life of Pi), the ending feels like a betrayal. Also, the swearing is excessive.

Heroes so filled with botox they have no facial expressions whatsoever.  The worst script and even worse acting.  I think Lundgren only worked out ok in Rocky IV because he spoke very little.  He speaks way too much here. Why put in the Charisma Carpenter character for 2 scenes that have nothing to do with anything else in the movie?  You know the saying \\"so bad it's good\\"?  It does not apply here - it's so bad it's really bad.

I've now listened to it three times, twice through my speakers and once with headphones.  Well played and well recorded.  With a nod to the past while playing in the present. they shack the shack.  This is a great album and I recommend it to anyone who loves rockabilly, rock & roll, and remembers stamping their feet while juke box played<br /><br />My only complaint is at 34 minutes, the CD is too short; I wanted more.

B005B0QYMM|4.0|I am the sort of person that normally does not get very moved by horror, I find slasher flicks quite boring and scream fests bordering on juvenile, however this film had the hairs on the back of my neck rising and I am well hairy so that is some feat.<br /><br />It all starts off with a group of intrepid paranormal investigative journalists or TV rip off chancers as some would call them, having their tapes found by the TV Company. They are doing a pilot series called `Grave Encounters' where they investigate haunted places and film the lot using the latest in ghost spotting technology, including Geiger counters and ectoplasm sensitive cameras - yeah right. Well any hoo they are on episode six - `the haunted asylum'- where they are at a former mental hospital. This was a place where experimental medicine was carried out on the patients, including frontier lobotomies, institutionalised abuse, suicide and murder - bwaaah!<br /><br />Led by naked self promotionalist, front man Lance Preston (Sean Rogerson) they pull out all the stops to ramp up the fright levels for the viewer, as Lance says `with slow motion and the right music behind it, everything is creepy'. So they go for a voluntary `lockdown' for eight hours on the building, the care taker will return at 6 am to let them out. They then rig up the building with cameras to take advantage of known `cold spots' to capture the other worldly goings on, then the bumps in the night begin and all of a sudden things aren't that funny anymore.<br /><br />This is a first outing for writers and directors `The Vicious Brothers', and I must say boys you have made quite an entrance. I was genuinely cacking myself on more than one occasion and what is more impressive is that as these are supposed to be edited down `found tapes' there is no music to aid in ramping up the fear factor. As this is yet another `found tape', film, there will inevitably be comparisons to the likes of `Blair Witch Project', `Cloverfield' and even `Troll Hunter'. This though deserves recognition in its own right as adding to the genre rather than reinventing or stealing from it. We do have lots of different camera types which are used to great effect to maximise the atmosphere of fear.<br /><br />It runs for an increasingly scary 92 minutes, but there is no filler here so not only is it about right in length, but it is one of those that almost feels much shorter. I am now awaiting the next offering from the brothers who actually are Colin Minihan and Stuart Ortiz, and we won't have long as they are putting the finishing touches to the imaginatively named `Grave Encounters 2', which I wish them every success with - this is one to watch, but with the lights on.Hunter'.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book is not beautiful but it is a disaster.<br />The main male character reveals himself in true brutality. He is violent and aggressive and over-protective and willing to beat any male who gets in his way or who looks at HIS girl too much or makes a comment about HIS girl that he does not approve of.<br />The main female character then goes one step further and encourages him to assault another student so her boyfriend does not look like he is \\"whipped\\"! Apparently this behaviour is acceptable as they are \\"in love\\" and the rest of the student body allow this violence to continue unchecked.<br />Even when they have separated he continues to stop men from approaching her and physically threatening them. He stalks her and then gets drunk and hurts her emotionally when she stands up to him.<br />Getting married at 19 to a man of this unstable, aggressive, violent, controlling character should not be encouraged.

B003Y5H5B0|5.0|The idea of seeing a movie version of 21 JUMP STREET didn't catch my interest but I was surprised at how many of my friends said it was funny and good.<br />The odd thing is the film is raunchy yet good-natured and above all, funny. There is a twist to the narc cops go back to high school as students story. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was the studious, nerdy guy in high school. His nemisis Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the good looking, not so bright jock type. Years later, they end up fairly useless police officers send undercover to expose a high school drug ring.<br />Though it hasnn't been that many years since high school for Schmidt and Jenko, the rules have changed. Today's high school kids are socially conscious vegetarians worried about the mileage their cars get. Brainless jocks are out. Nerdy intelligent guys are now popular. The rules have changed except for one thing. Someone is suppling the high school kids with a new \\"feel good\\" drug that quickly turns bad and potentially fatal.<br />Although the dialogue can get rather \\"colorful\\" and there are a lot of references to the male \\"organ,\\" 21 JUMP STREET is actually a coming of age story between two opposites who learn to love and respect each other. Despite the raunchy humor and drug use, there is a gentle nature to the story. Hill and Tatum work together well and there is a genuine friendly chemistry between them. One of the funniest scenes is when the two have to take the drug to prove they are not cops and the hallucinations are hilarious. Don't miss the small but very noticeable cameos by an original 21 JUMP STREET TV star and current top movie star.<br />We all need a funny movie at times and for once this is not a mindless rauchy comedy. There is a message and a story. It's clear why Jonah Hill was nominated for an Academy Award for another role last year. This guy is going places.

B00881VLCE|3.0|First time I did a puzzle I had the same problem others did with not being able to place the last piece or two but after that I was able to finish them. My only complaint is the touch is not that sensitive - too much pressure or multiple swipes needed to move the pieces from the selection. But otherwise a fun app for the price - free! What would be helpful would be the ability  to zoom in to see the pieces better.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this box set of 5 books as a \\"back-up\\" book, you know in case I finished a book and couldn't download a new one right away. The first couple of books in the box set left me a little depressed with the endings... then I get to the 4th book and was so hooked I couldn't stop flipping pages to see what would happen. I was so sad to start the 5th book not knowing that there was a 6th book. I had to go and buy the 6th before I could finish the 5th one. I hope that there are many more to come in this series! I want to know what happens in Silo 17 with Solo and the kids. I want to know if the \\"virus\\" spreads to the other silos. I want to read them NOW!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not sure what all the excitement is about.  Certainly not a well written book. Downloaded it after hearing and reading so much about it.  Waste of time and money. Very predictable. I won't be reading the next two.
B006RUJST6|1.0|I am very suspicious of all the 5 star reviews.  I counted dozens of \\"Wows,\\" \\"Amazing,\\" and \\"Loved loved loved it\\" titles, and they were all gushing with emotion.  That should have set off a warning bell.<br /><br />I have come to the conclusion that just because a book has hundreds of good reviews, does not mean I will like it.  At best this book should only merit a 2 or three star rating as it is silly and childish.  I only stayed with it so that I would be able to say I finished it before giving this review.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually saw the movie first. When I saw the advertising and the crazed fans I kind of pushed it aside and ignored it because I hate fads. They usually tend to be shallow, superficial, and completely obnoxious. This book is none of those.<br /><br />After I saw the movie, I had to get the book. And I spent the last two days reading it. I forced myself to put it down in the middle to get some sleep, it was that hard to stop reading. I have to admit, it is partially that 90-95% of chapters end in cliffhangers. In most books that gets annoying, but here it's completely understandable. It's the stream of consciousness of a girl in a kill or be killed situation. But it's also the story. It's almost impossible to depart from this story without knowing what turns it's going to make. Actaully, I KNEW in advance what the turns would be and I still wanted to keep going. That, in a nutshell, is an authors dream. It's a bit of a mantra we're taught in writing classes: \\"People are looking for every excuse to put your book down. Don't let them.\\" Indeed, Ms. Collins has perfected that art.<br /><br />It was also a bit difficult to read, mostly because of the premise. I bawled, I'll admit. It's extremely painful to think about. But it's also a potential future for us, and please let me explain that. Our populations are growing, what will we do when we run out of food and space but kill each other off for our own survival, as happens in the history of this book? Then you know someone will set up a regime (if people are left at all) and quite possibly will do anything to make sure the rest of the people serve them, need to serve them. That's history, and it's so eerie because it feels so real.<br /><br />My last comment is that I'm glad it was aimed at young adults. After other horrendous books (that shall not be named, though we all know which four I speak of, I'm sure), it's great that something is there to treat them like mature, intelligent adults. That is what young adult fiction should be, not the excuse it currently is for bad writing and even worse story telling. However, it will take a mature mind to be able to handle this. I believe the tween/teen/young adult range IS capable, if they put their minds to it, but the people I find not liking it are the kind that can't handle it. Or, like me, they haven't tried it because they assume it's just another pathetic fad.<br /><br />People, don't be like me. If you have a level, mature head, read this book. Just make sure you have a good stretch of time to read it. And, if I may offer, the best place to put it down if you need to is in the MIDDLE of a chapter, not at the end. That harkens back to my earlier comment about cliff hangers. She isn't kind to people who need to finish their chapters before going to bed, so break that habit and cut it off in the middle of a chapter if you have to cut it off anywhere.ion should be, not the excuse it currently is for bad writing and even worse story telling.

B0086700CM|5.0|The new update works fine on my Kindle Fire. The app recognizes every swipe, tilt, and tap. I guess other people are having trouble, but like I said, it works without flaw or lag on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />** Oh, and by the way, Kindles Fires are among the very newest (and best) e-readers out there.... The reason that the &quot;Brave&quot; Temple Run is not available for Kindle Fires is because they are Andriod devices. Apparently, &quot;Brave&quot; Temple Run is not yet available on the Andriod app market, only for the iPhone app market. No other Andriod device could get &quot;Brave&quot; Temple Run either.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I am not a review writer, by any stretch of the imagination. But I remember distinctly the first time I felt compelled to write my first review here and it was after the release of Extraordinary Machine. I couldn't stand the negative reviews of music that has so much to offer.<br /><br />Here I am again 7 years later, feeling the same overwhelming need to share my feelings about The Idler Wheel in the face of those who claim to be Fiona Apple fans that gave this CD two listens and then couldn't bring themselves to listen to it again. I am sad for you. I urge you to reconsider.<br /><br />Yes, it is different. Some of the melodies are strange to hear at first, but it is that complexity that will engage you and capture you. Perhaps you have grown accustomed to easy pop from the radio that doesn't respect you enough to even attempt to engage your mind and your heart? I get that. I almost fell into the same trap. But my experience with Extraordinary Machine taught me that some things need to be explored for more than surface impressions to be truly appreciated. The Idler Wheel is no less worthy of the same attention and respect. You will miss out on something special if you rely on the quality of music you are used to hearing to lead you to put this album away.<br /><br />Fiona has matured and so has her music. The journey has been amazing so far. My only wish is that she wouldn't wait so long between albums, but if 7-8 years is the price to pay for what she puts out it is worth it. Thank you Fiona.
B0086700CM|5.0|Easy to learn but challenging! Love this game! The commands are simple but when you get into the game it's a nice test for your brain.
0316113506|5.0|A year ago (July 1st 2011), just 24 days away from turning 66, I started reading this book and started walking. The information about what exercise does for the brain and body made me want to give it a try. I started with 15 minutes out the door away and 15 minutes back, then worked up to whatever I could walk in an hour. I was focused on 30 days making it a habit. I walked every day for the first 30, and since then have never skipped more than 3 days in a row. I now walk 1 to 1 1/2 hours almost every day. I have not been sick (not even a cold) since I started (knock on wood) and my blood pressure returned to the level I had in my 20s. In one year I've lost 26 pounds, two sizes, 5 inches off my waist and gained a lot of muscle. I highly recommend reading this book and putting it into action! A few days ago, I decided to mark the anniversary by reading it again. Still a good read and it gave me some new goals! I think I may splurge and get a heart monitor for year two.<br /><br />I speak mainly from my own experience of adding walking to my life to improve health, but the information in the book about exercise and education, as well as exercise and work performance, is timely and interesting. It should probably be read by anyone involved in education or desiring a more productive workplace.
B006H8BIIM|4.0|Okay so usually I do a little research before clicking on the free app of the day because who wants a list full of useless apps right?  I almost passed on this game due to the reviews and I'm so glad that I didn't.  It's a hard game - really hard - I will give it that.  I made it up to level 5 or 6 without buying a single upgrade - you just have to watch what your objectives are and plan for them versus trying to shoot down everything in sight, because you're not going to be able to do so most of the time.<br />In-app purchases are definately not required.  I'm glad I read the tip someone else posted about how playing on survival hard mode is rewarding because it so is.  Tons more fun too.  Also farming some of the tougher campaign levels is pretty profitable as well, and again - fun.<br />I'd recommend getting the generator as your first upgrade because I find myself dying due to lack of power most of the time.  The extra turrets for the base were a lot more worth it than I expected as well.<br /><br />It's a fun little diversion and it makes you work for your rewards - the difficulty curve is pretty steep, but there is a reason that endless survival opens up so quickly.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I thought The Hunger Games was a pretty good movie, and I liked it more than I thought I would have. Jenniffer Lawrence was great as Katniss, I loved the actresses who played Prim and Rue, and the actors who played Haymitch, Cinna, Caesar were spot on. The only performance I did not like was Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. I think the fight scenes were a little rushed.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Not as good as the first book in the series but I liked it.  I would read it again from archives.  Too bad the author died without writing more in the series - about the sister,.
145162445X|4.0|Undeniably, Krauss is a brilliant physicist, and I found the book fascinating. However, as with many scientists, the author has a potentially limited view regarding the origins of the universe, or universes, and of reality for that matter. Also, the author spends a great deal of effort in the book attempting to refute the existence of God, or creator, and rather than referring to what other intellectuals have to say regarding what is commonly referred to as \\"spirituality,\\" he points to less educated speculations regarding concepts of God and the origins of the universe, and then dismisses the whole concept of spirituality as being ridiculous.<br /><br />Krauss asserts that it is childish to believe in anything which is not backed by empirical evidence. What he doesn't mention, however, is that as long as there is an observer, i.e., researcher/s, no study, experiment, or science is truly objective precisely by virtue of there being an observer. Additionally, it is common knowledge that many supposed scientific \\"facts,\\" all of which were supported by empirical evidence, are later proved incorrect (sometimes completely incorrect).<br /><br />In the book, Krauss entertains the notion that there might exists invisible beings, races of beings whose universes overlap our own but exist in different dimensions or whose laws of physics are different than those of our own universe, a very speculative assertion at best. Yet, he ridicules the idea of a spiritual being or entity, an \\"invisible\\" being no less. The author is seemingly unable to speculate whether God or other spiritual beings might exist in a different dimension and whether these spiritual beings are the same beings whose existence the author entertains.<br /><br />Krauss states, \\"A truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.\\" However, a truly open mind might include one which can speculate that subjective experiences (phenomenology) may also be part of what could be a broader spectrum of reality, one which is not based solely on empirical, or \\"objective,\\" evidence.<br /><br />Later, the author refers to \\"empty space\\" as nothing, but one can argue that empty space is, indeed, something by virtue of its mere existence. Along the same lines, Krauss suggests that energy is nothing, but it appears obvious that this, too, can be argued since the author's definition of existence and nonexistence may differ greatly from another physicist's ideas on the same issue. Finally, Krauss states that empty space is a \\"boiling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence.\\" If, in fact, these particles can \\"pop\\" in and out of existence, a reasonable inquiry might ask what else is capable of popping in and out of existence or, rather, what we assume to be existence and nonexistence? If we are going to speculate, i.e., wonder or guess, at all on these matters, as Krauss has done in parts of his book, perhaps we should not easily dismiss the musings of slightly less scientific individuals on the origins of the universe and existence.

034580404X|5.0|'This book isn't for everyone, but I know you'll love it.'<br /><br />'You haven't read it??? This is right up your alley!'<br /><br />'This has \\"Danielle\\" written all over it.'<br /><br />My friends were right.<br /><br />First, I must agree with others who feel this series wasn't well written. The best way to weave a story is to show, not tell; E L James told. I also found the italicized comments by Anastasia Steele to be a tad annoying. In 'Fifty Shades Freed,' for example, I felt the following paragraph was poorly written:<br /><br />'I close my eyes. Why did I spend the first twenty years of my life not doing this? I chose reading over dancing. \\"Jane Austen didn't have great music to move to and Thomas Hardy...jeez, he'd have felt guilty as sin that he wasn't dancing with his first wife.\\" I giggle at the thought.<br /><br />In first-person narrative, perhaps it could have read like this:<br /><br />'My eyes close and I feel the music propelling me to another level, one I have never felt until now. Surely I could have put down 'Jane Austen' for the occasional night out.<br /><br />The reader doesn't need all of the details the author provided. Those two sentences tell me all I need to know about how she's feeling:<br /><br />1. She's relaxing and enjoying herself.<br />2. She's young and has spent most of her life reading classic literature.<br /><br />Even better, scrap the first-person narrative:<br /><br />'Christian watched with intensity as his wife wiggled in her short dress, suppressing every urge to demand she sit back down. She was no longer the mousy bookish-girl who stumbled into his office, and she had never been another submissive.'<br /><br />These two sentences say even more:<br /><br />1. Anastasia is coming out of her shell.<br />2. Christian still has a desire to control and dominate.<br />3. Anastasia and Christian must meet halfway to make this marriage work.<br /><br />Less is always more...unless I'm eating apple pie.<br /><br />The relationship between Anastasia and Christian is the definition of codependency; in real life it would not have the same happy ending. Any man with his control issues would end up hurting himself or, worse, his lover. Of course one could argue that if he wasn't so obsessed with her then he'd be out cheating, knowing she'd be eternally faithful. So in a twisted way his controlling, possessive, obsessive behavior makes the union stronger.<br /><br />I can't believe I just said that, but then again this is fiction.<br /><br />As soon as they were wed I noticed his controlling behavior escalate, beginning with her sunbathing topless; I was disgusted that Anastasia didn't stand up to him. The first two books were enjoyable, but the third book was a roller coaster ride of emotions. It was so bad, in fact, I book marked where they had the 'big fight' and pushed myself to get past it in one reading.<br /><br />I was semi-satisfied with the ending, as he blatantly said he wanted her barefoot and pregnant in his kitchen...and she agreed. Only a character like Christian Grey could make controlling be sexy, but perhaps that's just my Scorpio personality making an appearance in an otherwise very enticing read.<br /><br />'Sexual' would be a gross understatement.<br /><br />I won't go into all of the, ahem, 'juicy' details, but the acts depicted in this book should only be performed between consenting adults who fully trust each other; adults who know when to 'safe word' and do it for fun, not punishment. No eye rolling from the peanut gallery, either. Yes, that should come across as common knowledge. However I was once an 18-year old woman, and at that age we 'feel' instead of 'think.'<br /><br />I was pleased the author inserted a few pages from the view point of Christian at the end; us women love to know what men are thinking. Although it kind of made me despise him, reading how he judged her the minute she tripped into his office.<br /><br />While I find it hard to read while listening to music, there are many 'scenes' in this series where I found it helped. Here are some personal suggestions.<br /><br />'Vanilla' Scenes<br /><br />'Wicked Game' by Chris Isaak<br /><br />'Strangers In The Night' by Frank Sinatra<br /><br />'Seduces Me' by Celine Dion<br /><br />'Forbidden Love' by Madonna<br /><br />'The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face' by George Michael<br /><br />'Father Figure' by George Michael<br /><br />'Damn! I Wish I Was Your Lover' by Sophie B. Hawkins<br /><br />'Unchained Melody' by The Righteous Brothers<br /><br />'Any Time, Any Place' by Janet Jackson<br /><br />'Angel' by Aerosmith<br /><br />'Other' Scenes<br /><br />'Buttons' by The Pussycat Dolls<br /><br />'Cream' by Prince<br /><br />'Human Nature' by Madonna<br /><br />'I Want Your Sex' by George Michael<br /><br />'I'm A Slave For You' by Britney Spears<br /><br />'Justify My Love' by Madonna<br /><br />'You Can Be the Boss' by Lana Del Rey<br /><br />'Love In An Elevator' by Aerosmith<br /><br />'Sexual' by Amber<br /><br />'Throb' by Janet Jackson<br /><br />'Touch Me' by Samantha Fox<br /><br />'S&M (Remix)' by Rihanna and Britney Spears<br /><br />That last one should really be the theme song.<br /><br />In the end a young, innocent woman saved an extremely wealthy man from a life of toxic relationships; and a very controlling man with more emotional baggage than a Jerry Springer show took a young woman under his wing, giving her everything she'd ever need...and more.<br /><br />I liked the 'more' part.
B005HSL626|5.0|The graphics in here are awesome!!!! I dont have Fruit Slice, but i would predict its the same gameplay, so i would recommend this since the graphics here look much better.
B000001G8R|4.0|For generations Mendelssohn's overtures wee admired and programmed by every symphony, but his sensibility has waned, and gradually the overtures vanished, leaving only \\"the Hebirdes\\" (fingal's Cave) and \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" in the standard repertoire. Even an omnivorous completist like Karajan didn't touch \\"The Fair Melusine\\" or \\"Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage.\\" So Abbado's DG collection with the LSO has hardly any rivals. It's mostly vigorous and sympathetic, although no single reading rises to the level of the best on disc. For that, you must turn to Beecham's \\"Fair Melusine\\" and Furtwangler's \\"Hebrides.\\"  But everything here is decently done; these readings are better than run throughs.<br /><br />On Berlin Classics Kurt Masur offers a competitive collection with the orchestra that has the proudest Mendelssohn tradition, the Leipzig Gewandhaus. He doesn't score dramatically higher than Abbado, however, and that disc excludes two items found here, \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and the Overture for Wind Instruments. Neither set rises to the absolute heights, but beggars can't be choosers. This is mostly music that barely holds its place in concert halls, and I'm grateful for the assured, well-played performances offered on both discs.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved it. I laughed, I cried, and it really made me think. I've never been so taken aback by a character. I love how real everybody felt. The plot was tiny, but enough to carry you through the relatively short book. =)
B001KVAMM4|5.0|With an air of Hollywood glamour, Mutter brings Mendelssohn to the catwalk. She's the only violinist who can pull the image off, and more power to her. Even as her interpretations have grown more eccentric an self-serving, Mutter remains charismatic, like Nigel Kennedy as he veers into unknown territory with a horde of fans in tow. So as not to give aid and comfort to the fuddy-duddies, I try to be positive about Mutter's desire to make standard works sound new again. No concerto for the violin plays itself as automatically as the Mendelssohn, and yet it never loses its freshness. Mutter doesn't put the score through its paces the way she tested the limits of, say, the Beethoven concerto, and she keeps the self-serving side tamped down. Therefore, this is a magnetic reading with lots of interest from bar to bar.<br /><br />DG provides smooth sound and a microphone placement that guarantees Mutter her close-up at all times. Her favorite conductor is Masur, although his steady workmanlike accompaniments are a far cry from her wanderings off the ranch. He seems content to follow passively in her wake when she suddenly slows down or lingers over an ear-ravishing phrase. Aside from a handful of Russians on the scene today, I don't think any rivals can match Mutter's glowing, powerful tone. she can make the violin speak in a dozen enticing voices. No one should approach this recording expect anything less than a star turn, but on its own terms this is an exciting reading. The light-as-air finale is especially winning. Souffle for dessert.<br /><br />Lynn Harrell, a powerhouse cellist, and Mutter's former husband Andre Previn enter for Mendelssohn's Piano Trio no. 1. I had trepidations that Previn would drag down the piano part, but no worries - this is a beautifully shaped and gorgeously recorded account. While it's playing you can enjoy the work's charms without thinking back to great recordings of the past, and on its own terms it offers ravishing sounds that older recordings can't match. The Scherzo should be light and brilliant, which depends a lot on the pianist's nimble fingers. Previ doesn't dazzle, but the whole reading is more exuberant than the recent high-profile one on Sony from Ax, Ma, and Perlman. You are aware throughout that Mutter is the leader of the pack - usually the pianist is - and that's agreeable enough since she is so compelling.<br /><br />Mutter also dominates the Violin Sonata with Previn as accompanist. It's a lovely reading with little self-indulgence. The mean-spirited Gramophone reviewer speaks of a \\"palpable aura of fear\\" surrounding Previn's pianism, and calls the Adagio \\"despreately drawn out.\\" Neither is true. Nothing has ever persuaded me to buy into Mutter's PR image, and yet what I hear on this disc is highly musical and enjoyable.rdings can't match.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|very good game. only flaw is that you cant have multiple. games and cant start over. it is a good game with its own challenges. maybe making it easier to get money would be nice too
B0079TQHDO|4.0|Another great read from Jeffrey Archer. Could hardly put this book down. Loved the characters and the plots. Really looking forward to the third book in this series. If you haven't read Jeffery Archer before you should go and read all his books, he writes a great story.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a fun game but it is very hard to complete. If you are up for a challenge then get this app!:)
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Wow, what a book. The plot is such a dilemna, a very grey area. Found it hard to put this book down, got drawn in and really didn't want the book to end. Am now in the process of reading all her books.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Mills and Boon with S&M. Utter tripe. What a serious waste of money. The first book in years that I haven't bothered to finish. It's not even decent erotica/porn! I had to give it one star to write the review, but it didn't even deserve that.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love it. its the best game ever I love the game. I would get it on my computer but I have never wean it thow
0345803485|1.0|50 THOUSAND shades of pure YUKKKK!!!!!!!  Worst piece of junk I have ever read!!!  It's not the topic that offends me....it's the fact that this book is a NY Times best seller and could have been written better by the proverbial infintie number of monkies sitting at an infinite number of typewriters....eventually they'll type a \\"best seller!\\"  But, with higher standards than this book.  Who told this lady she could write?  Only in American can someone who butchers the written word become a millionaire.  Wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this book!  I thought it had to be good because it is on the best seller list.  Boy, was I wrong.  Bad! Bad! Bad!  And by the way, the ending stinks, too!!!!!
1449305172|1.0|I don't write many Amazon reviews but I feel I have to share this with other readers so they wont be paranoid like me.<br /><br />I, like millions of people, enjoy the convenience of ordering Amazon.com products. After reading Ash Maurya's book, \\"Running Lean\\" I was inspired and want to move forward with my product. He provided a website and after printing it, it looked pretty cool. It's something I can use to share my idea.<br /><br />I wrote Ash an email and thanked him for writing the book, what looked to be a comprehensiveness book to today's step-by-step business start up. He replied. He asked what my idea was so he may chimed in weather it was good idea to spend on patent costs. He doesn't believe patenting cost is a good idea. I replied and shared my idea and it's been a month and I haven't heard from it. Talking about leaving your reader hanging! WTH?!<br /><br />It's distasteful for an author or anyone to pretend to help but doesn't replied once you'd shared your idea. If you're not planning on replying then don't ask. Now I'm paranoid, is he passing my idea to other to have it patent.<br /><br />We don't live in a perfect world. The phrase, \\"dog eats dogs\\" is a common cliche in the business world. But just because a guy has a a book doesn't mean you should share your idea with him. So don't be naive like me and only share your ideas with NDA otherwise you might lose a few nights of sleep when he doesn't reply your email.
1455508969|5.0|This book \\"The Lucky One\\" was another one of Mr. Sparks awesome books! I am so hooked on this mans books that I can't order them fast enough!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Into the Darkest Corner forced me to stay up way too late too many nights. I am an avid reader and honestly it's been a long time since I read a book that I just couldn't put down. I highly recommend this great book!

B007V2UGPE|5.0|keeps me focused on more than one task very crisp graphics for the fire.  responsive to where I touch the screen wont be displeased with this one. although I wish I could adjust the music and sound effects volumes instead of just off and on. had to turn the main kindle volume to adjust for the sometimes annoying voices so others in the room don't have to fight the urge to take it out of my hand and throw if I keep losing on a level.  otherwise its simple real time strategy like tug of war except with swords and tricks unlocked as ive progressed.  like it a lot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|For how many people keep loving this series, I don't know why it such a low rating here. This book is amazing! It not only intrigues you sexually, but it makes you laugh and cry at the same time. People keep comparing it to Twilight, but it is not the same at all. Yes, this has a similar feel to it, but the content is completely different, and people need to keep that in mind.
0345803485|5.0|These books are really hyped up.  Erotic reading isn't my normal thing but I wanted something light and fun to read over the summer.  I am glad I gave this a try.  The writing isn't heavy and it's not perfect but it is fun!
B0000CABJ1|5.0|She will be missed. enjoyed the collection.  Good overall view of her body of work. Don't people have anything else better to do with their time than write reviews of products they have purchased?
0345803493|5.0|I have heard so much about these books from friends that even though \\"erotic\\" isn't really my thing, I wanted to check them out.  Yes, the writing isn't great but it's a fun summer read.  Sometimes your brain needs a break from heavy reading.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Have always loved the bee Gee's . Now I have an ultimate collection since no more music will be coming from them unfortunally

B007SGM084|4.0|I thoroughy enjoyed the series.  Was a fast read.  Sometimes quiet intense and provacative.  Looking forward to another book from the author...
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great game. Not too easy so its bored and not to hard to make you give up. Best finding things game I have played so far. Keeps my attention. Good graphics too. Story line is a bonus like a comic book.
0307592731|5.0|What a journey Cheryl took on the Pacific Crest Trail.  Never does she ask for you to feel sympathy towards her being totally ill prepared- physically & mentally.  She also had no idea what to pack for her trip, just read her description of \\"monster\\" her backpack but again she doesn't beg for sympathy.  It simply is part of her journey.<br />My husband I have hiked parts the AT so I do know the rigors of hiking and Cheryl describes the hiking with wonderfully accurate detail.<br />The only time I could say she put the blame where it did not belong was decribing the camp hosts who asked her to pay for her night of camping.  They were doing they job and Cheryl was trying to camp for free. She was hiking the trail, so go camp on the trail. Don't expect a free ride, pay your way like expected.  She did get so much given to her I guess she started to expect perks that weren't hers to get.<br />Glad she found her way.  The book was riviting and totally consuming.  A wonderful summer read for both men & women who have experienced their own unique journey.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|My choice over any other. The best on the market and I'm sure I have downloaded every one there is.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I did like this version but just to warn u  my. little brother thought every thing was free on the app after I bought it.  but no.  there are these little blackholes they give u but if u want more u can buy them. he thought it was just part of the game but it wasn't that was the only donner
0307592731|4.0|I have to admit that this was an odd book because I did not like the main character, the author.  I think she meant for readers to feel sorry for her and excuse the bad person she became the bad things she did, especially to her husband.  But I couldn't do that.  No matter the reasons, she is still accountable for her actions.  But despite not liking her, I still enjoyed the book.  Which I think says a lot for this book.  I felt like I was out there on the trail with her, helpless and unprepared but brave or desperate enough to see it through.  It also reminded me that this adventure had to happen in the pre-internet days.  Many of her mistakes would have been solved by a simple google search these days.  I also really liked the ending.  It brought it all home and answered a questions I had throughout the book.  Thanks for writing your story.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This performance, which is fully staged even though it's a concert performance, is outstanding.  It is exceedingly better than the movie performance with an almost \\"delicate\\" phantom.  Having seen the Phantom several times on stage and owning the original London cast recoding with Michael Crawford, I was completely let down by the movie version.  What a total waste of time the movie version is.<br /><br />This Royal Albert Hall performance is full of energy and really conveys to true love story that it is.  While Ramin Karimloo is not Michael Crawford, he is most excellent; and conveys a real man with a broken heart instead of the almost feminine approach of the movie phantom.<br /><br />Buy this one.  It will grab you completely, and really shows why the Phantom has been such a phenomenon all over the world.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|What can I add about this very clever and hilarious TV series, which I just discovered even though it's in its sixth season, when there are already 441 reviews posted here? Probably not much but I'll try.<br /><br />Though the Complete First Season has been released before, a new \\"Combo Pack\\" is now out (as of July 10th) with both Blu-ray AND DVD versions plus the new Ultra Violet concept - all in one package. (So you will never be without a chance to watch these episodes again and again.). For those folks who complained that the only \\"bonus\\" in the original First Season set was the \\"Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory\\" featurette, you'll be happy to know that they added a gag reel this time. I'm not sure that is enough to replace your earlier set but it's a nice bonus for those - like me - just discovering it.<br /><br />There's no reason to go into the plot of the show - again, it's covered in other reviews - but I did notice that after the first for or five episodes (which at 22 minutes - no commercials - are like potato chips: you can't stop with just one) the characters changes in odd ways. Leonard seems less nerdy and Penny less overtly sexy (plus she must have lost her job at The Cheesecake Factory because by the fourth episode or so she is serving the \\"guys\\" at a local hamburger place in a non-TCCF uniform.<br /><br />The ONLY thing I found a bit of a downer - and I don't see it mentioned in other reviews - is that the series uses a \\"laugh track\\" which was very popular in the 1960s before TV comedies started being recorded in front of live audiences. It is really annoying because it sounds phony and you will hear the same laughter over and over, sometimes even before the punch line. It bothered me a lot during the first three episodes but I guess I got used to it a little as time went on. It's just too bad that they felt need to use these.<br /><br />So, I'm jumping on the bandwagon for this series and in the process of \\"catching up\\". If you've read this review before the others, I hope I've encouraged you to scroll down and read some more. Better yet, just sample an episode and , like me, I'm sure you will get hooked!<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"s review before the others, I hope I've encouraged you to scroll down and read some more. Better yet, just sample an episode and , like me, I'm sure you will get hooked!<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B007KQI1NA|4.0|This unit works very well. However, if you are running Windows 7, do not use the drivers on the included CD-ROM.  Go to the Globalsat website and download the newest ones for proper operation.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|This is our first Bruder toy and we're delighted. In the hands of our almost-three-year-old, it has become an instant favorite. He plays with it constantly and wants to carry it everywhere, this in a sea of other tractors, bulldozers, and backhoes.<br /><br />The detail level is great - enough to keep his interest with all the functional parts and motion variations. It's proven to be very durable. He operates all the functions and everything works well with no hint of strength issues. The cab roof and engine cover are metal. All the other parts are plastic, with soft plastic tires.<br /><br />It cleans up easily, so he digs in sand and dirt outside, then can bring it in for a quick rinse and can run around the house with it, too.<br /><br />The catalog that came with the unit is also seeing heavy use and I expect we'll be picking up more Bruder toys before long. This one is terrific. I only wish their entire line was easier to find in the US!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this app overall. Only the occasional video ads that do not allow you to skip them are annoying.  Otherwise I enjoy it.

B007MDB71O|4.0|I watched this film on a recent flight to Europe.  I'm not, by any stetch of the imagination, a fan of movies like this but I was very pleasantly surprised by how good it is.  The story is strong and the acting was believable.  The visual effects are dazzling, even on an airplane screen.  I'm going to buy the DVD.  I can wait to see it on an HD large screen.  Who knows. I might be a sci-fi convert.  If I had read the reviews about this film I probably wouldn't have taken the time to see it.  Reviewers generally have their own agenda, so do your own review.  See this film and try to enjoy it for what it is.  Entertaining, escapist entertainment that is very, very well done.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fast paced and really enjoyable. Reminds me of the original Mario brothers. Great fun.<br /> Can't wait to get to the next level.

B006H8BIIM|5.0|I understand what everyone is talking about, but it is .99 cents to upgrade. I like to play something before spending more the .99 cents. but what it comes down to is this is a fun game and worth the 2.50 total to play it.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|Having just broken a 3rd Generation Kindle by dropping it on the screen (even though it was in a protector that just happened to be open), my internal paranoia told me I needed to by a cover with the new Kindle Fire.  My mother had purchased this model and was very happy with it, so I decided to purchase it.  So far, I have dropped the Kindle once, and luckily the ends are raised slightly enough beyond the device that it landed on the corners, and the screen was protected.  Folding cover also takes pressure off of the hands and thumbs, and works well when playing games or watching a movie.  Highly recommend!
B0086700CM|5.0|you jump and run from this giant monster then earn coins to buy more people and coins like red blue and orange coins it is one of my favorite games hopefully you like it ti it is great
B004H7Q2YA|2.0|This is a cheap science fiction story - the kind told many times - and not a Sherlock Holmes type tale, the kind that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote. It focuses upon Holmes investigating a sea wreck caused by an attack by an underwater giant prehistoric animal and the murder of some people by a dinosaur.<br /><br />True, Holmes makes broad deductions from small items, such as a stone, and he has a side-kick, Watson, who once served in the army and is not too bright, but this is where the similarity ends. Additionally, Ben Syder who plays Holmes lacks the wit and force of the traditional Holmes, although he does fly in a zeppelin to save England and does fight a robot. Worse of all is the identity of the villain. Traditionalists will be surprised and appalled.
B000UX6THK|4.0|This \\"definitive\\" edition permitted me to saturate myself in this TV game changer.  Decades old now, the influence of Twin Peaks can be seen here and there in many shows, so it was helpful to me to get a grasp on where the show is honored currently.  I found the series compelling, yet agree with many that the second season lost its bearings, yet it seemed in the process to solidify the notion of ensemble TV, many plotlines ravelling and unravelling as matters grew ever more eerie.<br /><br />Would have welcomed more from Lynch on Lynch, more critical commentary from others expert in such matters, more bios of the many fine actors.  But I suppose I must go to Twin Peaks festival for that!
0151013837|3.0|Here's a secret: I didn't know what to think after reading Yann Martel's Life of Pi. I still don't. And I was baffled when I read reviews (tons of them) saying things like \\"omg this book will make you believe in God,\\" or \\"after reading Life of Pi, you'll definitely never want to eat another animal again.\\"<br /><br />What the f*** is this?<br /><br />Fine, great--it's one thing for reviewers and normal people to say things about a book (like how I am supposed to feel afterward) but when the author actually says stuff like \\"yeah, this is gonna change your life,\\" in all seriousness, I feel like doing bad things to that author. But Martel doesn't actually say that and I don't ever want to actually do bad things to any author but, Martel says something more like, \\"this book will make you believe in God,\\" something like that. Who the f*** do you think you are, Yann Martel? Is this how one wins the Man Booker? Confidence is one thing but this, this is just--b*******. But, if I hate this book so much, then why am I still bothering? you might wonder. Well, simple. Like I said, it won the Man Booker, and unfortunately (for me,) this was my first Man Booker so, I sorta kinda wanted to see what all the fuss was about. (And also, just because I don't like a book doesn't mean I won't read it.)<br /><br />Anyway, it begins in typical this-is-not-your-regular-story-with-white-people fashion. In the sense that we generally assume our main character, unless stated otherwise, is white. Pi is not white though. And even his name is, uh, different. So, as expected, Martel expounds on all these things: Pi's origins, the nature of his name, his own personal religious beliefs, why his parents are the way they are, how it is he actually ends up stranded on a lifeboat just by himself and a tiger and how he eventually overcomes his hardships. I'm all for that and the prose in Life of Pi is pretty easy to digest. I'll even add points for the simple reason that Martel manages to write a somewhat successful story that features over 200 pages of nothing-but-being-in-the-middle-of-the-f***ing-ocean! On a lifeboat! With a tiger! But, as you would come to expect, even a Man Booker can't be perfect (ha!). There are issues with the story. There is repetition and, naturally, a lot of introspective monologue-ing and a few boring bits that drag on needlessly but I did like the feeling of eavesdropping on this kid who is trapped in the middle of the ocean with a tiger and nothing else. That was sort of interesting. And then talking about the different stages of dehydration coupled with the process of clothes rotting off your body because of salt and too much sun--that was good. I won't spoil the ending for you either (the big ending that is supposed to make you believe in God) but though I am unsatisfied with the story as a whole, I do have to say I enjoyed the ending, a little. It was sort of what I expected but also, not at all. Something unexpected happens and that's what really makes the ending shine, I think. And the thing that happens is the type of thing that makes you either really hate this book or appreciate it even more and think it's perhaps the greatest Man Booker book. (FYI, I absolutely hated the ending the first time.)<br /><br />But I digress. Life of Pi gets an even 3 from me because the bits about the author (at the very beginning and throughout) were unbearable, and the way Martel describes the lifeboat sequences, and how Pi manages to separate himself from the tiger for so long. This was all confusing to me (and maybe I am too dumb to understand or maybe there is just too much boat terminology or I maybe was distracted by something in real life during all of these sequences) but a good 100 pages could have been cut from this prize-winning book. And I like it that Martel takes a weird premise and sort of does his own thing with it, that's cool. But I didn't like that Martel tried to push (his) religion onto me. I've already made my decision aboutthat and shame on you (Martel) for telling me I will believe in God after reading this book. I didn't find it to be capable of doing that.<br /><br />Then again, maybe everything in this book went over my head. Like the ending...that and shame on you (Martel) for telling me I will believe in God after reading this book. I didn't find it to be capable of doing that.<br /><br />Then again, maybe everything in this book went over my head. Like the ending...
1400032717|2.0|~2.5/5<br />[Taken from my blog.]<br /><br />I found this at a local used bookstore, and thought that it sounded interesting. It sounded like something I would like, and after some debating (and a few trips), I got it, although I figured it would take me a while to finish it. Just because it's not a quick, easy read that would capture my attention like some others. I took it with me to Japan, and it was the first book I finished. And I was expecting to like it more than I did. Which is a bit disappointing, honestly.<br />The book is about a boy who has a hard time dealing with people and understanding them. I want to say he's autistic, but I'm not sure if that's the correct term, the right... disorder or whatever. And I don't want to be insensitive, or anything of the like, about it. Aside from that, some stuff happens with his parents and neighbors, which he wasn't expecting, and didn't react very well to. I'm not going to spoil anything beyond that, though.<br />At first I enjoyed the book. It was interesting and I liked the boy, found how he handled the world, or tried to handle it, really interesting, and I liked it. But then it got closer to the end of the book, and I wasn't enjoying him so much anymore. He started showing that, whatever it was that he had, autism or not, he had a more severe case than I'd thought. (And I am going to assume that he has a more severe case, instead of my first take on it, that it was badly written and exaggerated, because I don't know anyone with a severe case in which they can't interact socially very well at all, but have only heard about it. And it might very well be like this.) I didn't like his choices and how he reacted to things with his father and mother, and I was upset about them. But I am going to accept that he reacted that way because of how he is, how his brain works differently than most. I don't like it, but I'm going to accept it and move on.<br />I did like how it was written. I see why it might bother someone, with so much repetitive starting and and's, but I enjoyed it, and thought that it made sense, what with being in the main characters head. It added to the voice, which I did like. And while I didn't like the character after a while, I did enjoy some of his smaller, clever little characteristics throughout the book, and the drawings in the book.<br />I don't really have much else to talk about, I don't think. That was the biggest thing that I had a reaction to. The ending brought my rating way down, and I am a bit upset about it still. Ah well.with so much repetitive starting and and's, but I enjoyed it, and thought that it made sense, what with being in the main characters head. It added to the voice, which I did like.

B00006JIA4|5.0|The Platinum Collection is perfect for someone like me, a listener of Queen's radio hits and a non collector of their albums.<br /><br />Most of their best known songs are represented in the first two discs.<br /><br />Greatest Hits 1 opens with Bohemian Rhapsody and includes Another One Bites The Dust, Crazy Little Thing Called Love and Don't Stop Me Now. It also contains the iconic Queen anthems We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions.<br /><br />Greatest Hits 2 has some of the songs that I like better such as A Kind Of Magic, Under Pressure, Radio Ga Ga, I Want To Break Free and Who Wants To Live Forever?<br /><br />Greatest Hits 3 is a mixed bag of guest vocalists, Freddie Mercury solos, remixes and other surprises. Elton John does an excellent job on The Show Must Go On and Somebody To Love featuring George Michael is taken from Five Live. There are remixes of Under Pressure and Another One Bites The Dust featuring Wyclef Jean. For me, the lovely surprises are the operatic duet Barcelona, Too Much Love Can Kill You, The Great Pretender and Thank God It's Christmas. So, Greatest Hits 3 is definitely terrific.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the songs are not remastered. So I have to turn up the volume a few notches just to hear them clearly.<br /><br />The discs are housed in a compact jewel box enclosed in a platinum slipcase. A very nice touch.<br /><br />The three can be purchased separately but if you haven't bought any of these, it is much cheaper to get The Platinum Collection. It's a great bargain!
0439023521|5.0|Loved the whole series! Hope more great books are on the way! Major improvement on some YA books that are vapid and unrealistic. Katniss was a realistic character that reflected the normal confusion and issues expected to be dealt with in a difficult world.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|I had to get this video because I missed the first fifteen minutes during the 1978  screening.<br /><br />The screenplay effectively throws out some characters and sub plots from the book. Cornelia Robson and Rosalie Otterbourne become one character while a sub plot involving one of the ship's staff by the name of Richetti was excised.<br /><br />Death On The Nile is one of Agatha Chrisrie's best novels. Set in 1937, the rich but not beloved heiress Linnet Ridgeway is murdered during her honeymoon on board the Nile steamer Karnak. In true Christie style, everyone save for her husband and once best friend turned love rival have a reason to kill her.<br /><br />The puzzle starts to deepen as bodies start to pile up. In addition, Poirot has to contend with a kleptomaniac, a misbehaved drunk and a crooked lawyer. I'm glad they did not edit these out.<br /><br />Peter Ustinov as Poirot differs vastly from Christie's literary description. But Ustinov flat out owns Poirot. His habit of gathering everyone to reveal the murderers' identities is in line with the fictional creation's vanity. Ustinov's Poirot also loves to eat. While he tucked into a lovely sundae in Evil Under The Sun, he has moray eel for dinner in this movie.<br /><br />Watching Death On The Nile is like taking a holiday. Expect plenty of breathtaking scenery as the characters travel in fabulous 1930s fashion to various locales - the Sphinx, the Egyptian pyramids and other ancient and exotic places.<br /><br />The veterans give the performances of their lives. Bette Davis is the covetous rich dame Van Schuyler with Maggie Smith as her acid tongued companion Miss Bowers. Angela Lansbury is a hoot as the sex author Salome Otterbourne and David Niven is great as Poirot's right hand man.<br /><br />Mia Farrow is a great choice as Jackie de Bellefort, the jilted wronged vengeful woman. Jane Birkin (yes she of the Birkin bag) is utterly convincing as the bullied maid while her self centred boss is played by Bond girl Lois Chiles (watch Moonraker). Generally the rest of the cast put up very strong performances. The young talents in this film must be legends now.<br /><br />Part murder mystery and part tragic romance, Death On The Nile brings to life Christie's most baffling case and takes you on an unforgettable cinematic outing. I'm glad to have kept the 70s novel with the movie poster on the cover.
0439023491|5.0|Wonderful depiction of a traumatic situation impossible to really understand unless extreme personal tragedy has touched you as deeply. Losing her supportive parent and being thrown into a caregivers role in a horrible world where ugly, desperate situations are common. No one can survive repeated trauma without it impacting deeply. Katniss was an exemplary character with such a strong spirit that allowed her to survive experiences that can kill or crush.
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|Lets be clear about one thing, this CD is not Rock.  Don't listen to anyone who claims this is like their old albums.  Lost in Echo and Castle of Glass are bearable songs, but this is not what the majority of us look for when we buy a rock cd.  There's barely any guitar use and most of the songs sound basically like a lullaby.  I don't know how anyone can claim this CD kicks ass when it doesn't even lift a leg.  I wasn't expecting much out of the CD after their last release and I got what I expected.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this series! It was great and had a realistic teen who was acting in perfect character for a tramatized 16yr old who lost one parent tragicly &  had to parent her parent & younger sibling through horrific circumstances. A great read! I read the entire series in 2 days while spending the weekend visiting family. I slept very little & read a lot! Good thing I am a speed reader & insomniac or my family would have objected!

B002VRZEYM|2.0|Though there is some shock value in this film, do not forget this film is made to entertain and to boost book sells by the author Pollan. Instead of refusing to eat off plate not made of gold, it seems Pollan refuses to eat anything not grass-fed.  I can see him pointing his nose up in the sky and saying, \\"Nope, I won't eat it, it has to be labeled 100% organic.<br /><br />Hmmm, to be shamed by the elite because of where you get your food, or even which food to eat is almost like a nightmarish sci-fi movie.  Pollan sure goes out of his way shame the lower-class laborers by telling them they are not eating the right foods.  A (possibly migrating) family arrives in America only to be harassed by food snobs, where these snobs also obscurely mock people about weight control.<br /><br />This movie does not have any beneficial standpoints on how to change the standards to govern food safety.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Just brilliant, as my PC version of it. It's one of the products that ease anybody's lives and will keep your notes safe and handy
B007SGM084|5.0|I purchased the Trilogy to have the convenience of all three books in one location on my Kindle and Kindle Fire. I didn't know what the books were about when I started to read them, but by the first few chapters I was hooked. I read all three books in a week! I would highly recommend the trilogy to any romance fan! I cannot wait until the author comes out with the next book about Christian and Anastasia!
B0032JTV6U|4.0|I won't go into detail about the production or story behind the series, there are plenty of websites where people can get information about the series. I will focus on DVD production and content.<br /><br />There are 7 discs, you can check the description above and see whats included in each one of them.<br /><br />The quality of this product is superb. Of course it has all the episodes, and even with some extra scenes which help understand some plots. Nothing major, but really neat that they included.<br /><br />While some of the extra content is really nice, some is just so so. Some give really nice insights and perspectives on the show, some are kind of boring. The jukeboxes in particular are good, but they seem to leave out some of the best performances, but I guess that's also a matter of personal taste from the viewer.<br /><br />The package is nice and sturdy, and a really important detail is that it has both spanish dubbing and spanish subtitles. While the dubbing is quite bad, the subtitles are great, and in my case, since i live in Costa Rica, this was a must for my family.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first season and want to collect the series, then this is a must.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who likes a good love story!I didn't know that it was an erotic romance when I started to read it, but I still enjoyed the story. This book was hard to put down and I read all three books in a week! I am looking forward to the author's next book!
006112429X|5.0|Shriver's work is exceptional. Her prose is brilliant and unpretentious and invites empathy with a conventionally unsympathetic character. I was astounded by the resonance of her writing- she does not delve into the mind of this conflicted mother in order to satiate an appetite for sensational crimes or to search for a moral resolution to some of the most heinous atrocities of our time, but in order to force us to recognise the humanity that exists in the families on the wrong side of front page news. Any adult  with experience of real human relationships, the ugly parts as well as the romantic ones, will find themselves identifying profoundly with a woman whose attitude ought to inspire revulsion. I was compelled and fascinated from start to finish. A contemporary masterpiece.
B0086700CM|5.0|Vert entertaing game. Raiders is a perfect description  You run fot your life and that's it. Gets very fast paced the longer you play. A truly enjoyable game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a free game that has alot of other apps in one... and the extra apps don't take up the extra memory
B006H8BIIM|5.0|Strategy is key. Some useful elements are obtainable with grinding. Cheating is available for an extra buck. Don't let the other reviewers fool you because on Google play it is a highly recommended game. Several games feature in purchase cheats and if the game is played correctly, these cheats are not needed. It is truly sad to see so much criticism about a developer attempting to make a little extra money, when it cost a lot more to make the game. Then again people always want something for nothing hence, wanting all the features for free.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|it charges real money to your amazon account and it wont even let you go to your home page without suiting my kindle off.and I played it once but after that I tried to get back in and it said I need additional coverage to play it and I'm all like wtf ive done it before

B005LAII1C|3.0|Well, \\"21 Jump Street\\" still gets my vote for best comedy of 2012.<br /><br />\\"Ted\\" is just like Jason Siegal's version of the Muppet Movie, except with breasts, curse-words, drugs, alcohol, teddy bear/human sex, and Borat-style non-PC humor.  It's a decent movie, but since most of the humor comes from shock value alone (remember the humor from Hangover Part II?), you're not going to find yourself putting this in your list of all-time greats.<br /><br />One of the problems this movie has is that Mark Wahlberg isn't a good comedic actor. He was OK in \\"The Other Guys' but here he's barely tolerable.  He doesn't do well interacting with the inanimate object of the teddy bear.  Mila Kunis is terrific, but after her the best acting comes from Sam Jones...the guy who played Flash Gordon back in the early 1980s.  The plot is the same as last year's Muppet Movie.  Boy and stuffed animal are friend.  Boy grows up and meets girl.  Girl wants boy to stop hanging out with stuffed animal and spend time with her.<br /><br />This was fun, but could have been better.  I expect lots of negative feedback since this is one of the few 3-star reviews of Ted.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is my favriote in the gamining industry<br />it is so cool want to take the idol would you
0545091020|1.0|I actually enjoy this book. However, Carolyn McCormack fails miserably with her narration on the audiobook. She is very anticlimactic and makes katniss sound like a little ten year old girl.

B000002WPI|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of 1960s and 70s rock, like Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, CCR, Johnny Cash, etc., and in past years I've disliked more and more rap/hip-hop. I would listen to the popular tracks on the radio and enjoy them for a couple days until I realized they all are just terrible rehashed beats and lyrics about nothing. A few months ago I decided I wanted a good rapper/rap group to listen to, and I remember always seeing the Wu-Tang Clan appear in Chappelle's Show (my all-time favorite tv show), but I never listened to them. I bought \\"36 Chambers\\" with only the knowledge that it was rated very high here on amazon. When I first heard \\"Shaolin shadowboxing, and the Wu-Tang sword-style\\" I was confused to say the least. Then out of no where I hear \\"Bring the motha f@#%!n ruckus\\" and I was blown away. I listened to the entire album 3 or 4 times in a row, and then proclaimed to myself that the Wu-Tang Clan is the best rap group of all-time.<br /><br />Lyrics are very important to me in music, and today's music has no lyrical depth. The Wu has crazy good lyrics that took me a while to understand a lot of the metaphors used (I'm sure I still don't understand half of them, but that's a good thing in my opinion). Inspectah Deck's verse in \\"Protect Ya Neck\\" is probably my favorite verse of the album. Raekwon's verse in \\"7th Chamber\\" is tight as you know what. \\"Shake the ground while my beats just break you down\\" gets me every time! I also love the repeated terms such as \\"rap assassin\\", \\"rap fanatic\\", \\"Shaolin style\\", \\"Killa Bees\\", etc. They just used their own experiences, styles, and flavor in every word; something that isn't done very often today.<br /><br />Speaking of style and flavor, it amazes me that the Wu (mostly RZA) had the balls to incorporate so much Kung Fu and martial arts film references in this album. It really could have tanked the album, and certainly wouldn't be successful in today's world. But the risk paid off in dividends. It's the only album out there with such a unique style, which is evident throughout \\"36 Chambers\\". The beats are good enough to listen to without lyrics. It certainly has the 90s sound that put hip-hop to forefront of the music industry, but has unfortunately been abandoned over the years.<br /><br />To sum this up as best as I can, I owe the Wu-Tang Clan a lot for awakening me to what hip-hop and rap can be when done correctly. This album, as well as the other Wu-Tang Clan and Wu solo albums, will be on my playlist forever. I stepped to the Wu, and it was the best decision I ever made in my life.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love my kindle fire.  Its easy to use and there is a large selections of apps. Great graphics, lightweight, and easy to read!
0307950689|5.0|This book held my interest all the way through to the last page, and I can't say that for very many authors. From a writer's standpoint, this is a well crafted book, and Dan doesn't get tired at the end and cut it off, but the book is full and rich to the very end, and has a satisfying ending. The research Dan did is amazing. I think Dan Brown is to this genre of fiction what Steven Spielburg is to movies. This book is a must read if you like be taken on a wild ride, and have your assertions challenged every step of the way.
0312641893|5.0|WOOOOW!!! This was absolutely one of the best books that I have read in a very long time. At no point throughout the book did I think \\"Give me a break\\"or scoff at a poorly constructed story line, plot flaw, or character flatness.<br /><br />At no point while reading this book did I think \\"Will this book never end?\\". It was quite the opposite. By the end of the book I was getting anxious at the slimming number of pages that I had left to read. Upon reaching the last 3 pages I slowed down my reading so that I could savor the pages even more, because there won't be another Lunar Trilogy book out for a while (this one was only just released in January of this year.)<br /><br />I'm a sucker for re-told fairytales. The more creative the better and, goodness, was this one creative. The main character, Cinder, is a strong girl but Meyer doesn't overdue it with the superhuman emotions. Cinder has a hard time dealing with things. She gets scared. She becomes sad. She has fits... but they don't result some kind of catastrophe that could endanger the planet. Cinder is not over-the-top like many YA fantasy books are these days.<br /><br />Cinder is a likable girl, her step-family not so much. The injustices done to her at the hands of other people just make you angry. The fact that Meyer can pull emotion out of the reader like that says something for her writing.<br /><br />Prince Kai was a good love interest for Cinder, a handsome guy but not so much so that it was completely unbelievable. His attraction to Cinder, while surprising, is not random or completely odd. He is not overly devoted, weirdly protective, and maintains his human flaws.<br /><br />The story line is compelling, the characters believable and loveable (or hateable, depending on which ones we're talking about here.), the imagery was full bodied without being overwhelming or boring. The main character actually had a PERSONALITY, which is a big one for YA fiction these days it seems. New Beijing is a place you can feel you've been to before, a place you've experienced for yourself. That is some darn-good-writing.<br /><br />Anyway. I will ABSOLUTELY be picking up the next book by Meyer. I read through this book in a day, I was hardly able to put it down. I highly recommend this book and very vehemently give it a 5/5.n feel you've been to before, a place you've experienced for yourself. That is some darn-good-writing.<br /><br />Anyway. I will ABSOLUTELY be picking up the next book by Meyer. I read through this book in a day, I was hardly able to put it down. I highly recommend this book and very vehemently give it a 5/5.

B006AX6ONI|5.0|This book by Mark Cuban was very interesting and encouraging to see how a guy who has made some bad businsess decisions in the past still fought and had the drive and determination to make it big.  This book outlines how he went from rages to riches, literally.  He didnt have much to his name after graduating from college, went from job to job trying to find a job he loved.  He says you should Love what you do or you wont be happy.  He admits to making bad business decisions but he has learned from them and is wiser for them now.  He outlines what you should do if starting a business, encourages you to become an entrpreneur.  Its a short read, I went through this book in 2 days, you might read it in one day if your a quick reader.  You also cant beat the price, I bought this ebook for .46.  For the price, you cant beat it, its money well spent and for some it will pay for itself many times over.
B007MAETA8|5.0|John Mayer's public mea culpa comes musically, a whispered plea for understanding after some serious public bumbling of his life. Who knew that, when his musical world finally had a collision with the paparazzi word, it would humble the guy into making the stellar music of \\"Born and Raised\\"?  It's the first album he's made where what used to be affectations towards the singer-songwriters of the 70's that John's long been enamored by become genuinely personal and effective.<br /><br />You can't blame the man for wanting to make something other than knock offs of his heroes. He may have been extremely good at doing just that, but now he wants to be the man who - as he states in the song \\"Queen of California\\" - finds the \\"sun that Neil Young Hung after the gold rush of '71.\\" The pallet he is drawing from is serious CSN&Y and James Taylor turf, yet now he sounds less like he's rubbing shoulders with them and more like he's proving he can make music that spiritually accentuates his forebears. Those public slaggings have obviously made him want to try harder, and left their stings. \\"Now the cover of Rolling Stone ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone,\\" he realizes in \\"Speak for Me.\\"<br /><br />\\"Born and Raised\\" also chucks aside any attempt at overproduction (no loudness wars here) for a spartan acoustic setting. \\"Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey\\" begs for quiet in a life that was filled with too much background noise, along with a great harmonica riff. Same with \\"If I Ever Get Around to Living,\\" as blatant a confirmation that trials by fire are something that need to be part of the past. The bulk of the album is spent in these contemplative moments, and it all rings true. It's not only Mayer's personal best, it maybe one of 2012's classiest albums.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|super fun cant stop playing!<br />I have been playing for hours you're going to<br />love it!!!! So try it what are you waiting for?!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It sorta stinks to have to play the same games over and over for points to unlock another game
0062060562|4.0|The topic of amnesia has been done over and over again both in books and in movies.  Probably because it is such an intriguing and frightening topic.  In Before I Go to Sleep, the main character, Christine has an amnesia that effected everything that occurred after an \\"accident.\\"  When she wakes up every morning, she still thinks she is in her 20's instead of the 47 that she actually is, she has no memory of the house that she is living in, or of her husband lying beside her in bed.  As she rushes into the bathroom in a panic, she is confronted with a set of sticky notes arranged around the mirror.  They tell her who she is, they remind her that she is married  and that her husband's name is Ben.<br /><br />Everyday Christine wakes up with no memory of the day before.  Until she starts seeing Dr. Nash, who has her write in a journal, to see if it will help restore her memory.  Then sometime during the day, Dr. Nash will call her, tell her who he is, and tell her where to find the journal.  So, that now even though she wakes up a blank slate, she has a better idea of who she is.  There is one disturbing thing about the notebook.  Inside the front cover it says, \\"Do Not Trust Ben!\\"  Christine must piece together the bits and pieces of her life from the journal.  She must figure out what was her accident that left her memory damaged.  Ben tells of an auto accident, but Christine has faint memories that suggest something much more sinister.<br /><br />This book held my interest from beginning to end, hard to put down at times, even.  Predictable, but with a few surprises thrown in.
030758836X|3.0|I liked the book and I was very into it and it kept my attention but the ending really just ruined the book for me. I think it should have been a little bit more...
030758836X|5.0|can not say enough good things about this book.  Seriously.  I can not.  Because most of what I want to say would involve spoilers.  It would involve me saying things like, \\"I was totally blown away when....\\" or \\"Oh my gosh, I couldn't believe it when...\\"  Trust me.  This is a book you want to read with someone.  You will want someone to talk with about it.<br /><br />It begins with Nick getting a call from his neighbor telling him that his front door is open and his wife's cat is out on the porch.  So, Nick rushes home and finds that indeed his door is open and the beloved, never go outside cat, is outside.  He becomes even more disturbed when he goes inside and finds the living room in a shambles and no sign of his wife Amy.<br /><br />The next chapter is Amy speaking.  It is Amy's diary from when her and Nick first met.<br /><br />The story continues with alternating Nick and Amy.  Nick current with the events surrounding Amy's disappearance and Amy in the past leading up to today.<br /><br />That's all I can tell you.  Really.<br /><br />Every single part of this book is good, from the very first sentence to the very last sentence.  On the very last page of the book, the last few sentences, I was still amazed at where the book was leading.  It kept going full speed ahead to the very end.<br /><br />The writing is excellent, but I was so absorbed in the book, I didn't stop to highlight many sections.  I had only one highlight:<br /><br />\\"I have become a wife, I have become a bore, I have been asked to forfeit my Independent Young Feminist card.  I don't care.  I balance his checkbook, I trim his hair.  I've gotten so retro, at one point I will probably use the work pocketbook, shuffling out the door in my swingy tweed coast, my lips painted red on the way to the beauty parlor.\\"<br /><br />This is the third book that I have read by this author, and I am anxiously awaiting her next!
B005LAII0I|5.0|I did not have the chance to see this in the theater so I was excited to see this on DVD. Seeing that my family are large Disney Fans, I was intrigued at how they would portray Snow White and the story that Disney took on so many years before. I was very impressed with this updated telling of the story and even more impressed with the acting within the movie. Julia Roberts does an amazing job as the Wicked Queen and you can tell that she had a ton of fun playing the character as well. Even beyond the BIG name actors (Such as Roberts) the film brings together a wonderful cast that simply makes the entire movie click and work. I was quite impressed throughout the movie and if you are a fan of the snow white story, this will be one you should pick up today!
0142410705|5.0|Immediately after reading, A Fault in Our Stars, I went on Amazon and downloaded An Abundance of Katherine's.  Like Fault in Our Stars it did not disappoint.  I have to say that I have a new favorite author and his name is John Green.  I know that his fiction is labeled young adult, but it is so much more.  The writing, the characters are all amazing.<br /><br />The main character of the story is Colin Singleton, a former child prodigy.  The story behind the Abundance of Katherine's is that Colin gets dumped.  Not just dumped, but dumped by 19 girls named Katherine.  It sounds absurd, but it so believable in this story.<br /><br />I really can't do it justice, so I'm going to let some of the writing speak for itself:<br /><br />\\"The morning after noted child prodigy Colin Singleton graduated from high school and got dumped for the nineteenth time by a girl named Katherine, he took a bath.  Colin had always preferred baths: one of his general policies in life was never to do anything standing up that could just as easily be done lying down.\\"<br /><br />\\"He thought of Chicago, where you can go days without ever once stepping on a single patch of actual earth.  That well-paved world appeals to him, and he missed it as his feet fell on uneven clumps of hardened dirt that threatened to twist his ankles.\\"<br /><br />\\"He couldn't quite pinpoint when Hassan had started to become like everyone else on the planet, but it was clearly happening, and it was clearly annoying.\\"<br /><br />Again, I highly recommend A Fault in Our Stars and An Abundance of Katherines.  I am sure I will be reviewing more of his books, since I can not get enough of this author.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have tried several different keyboards, and this is by far my favorite.  I find it so helpful because it does learn how I type and does an excellent job predicting what I will say next.  After getting my wife to try this for a week she became hooked, and won't use anything else.  Such a great app!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Downloaded this app to have a calculator for my Kindle Fire &amp; I love it! easy to use &amp; I love the big display. haven't experienced any issues with it &amp; would definitely recommend it!
0670021652|3.0|When I first started this book, I thought, 'dear me, what self-indulgent nonsense. She goes on and on about how awful and dreadful and unfair it was that she and her (Brazilian-born, Indonesia-residing, Australian citizen) lover had to get married so they could live together in the US. Really?' It came across as the tedious whining of a spoiled, boring, white woman with a massive sense of entitlement.<br /><br />BUT...when I skipped over her own non-essential story (and the lack of research about the Hmong people she encountered in Vietnam), it actually became an interesting exploration of marriage through the ages in Western society. Best to skip straight to this part if you are interested in substance rather than personal hand-wringing.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I really liked this game until it quit working.  Wouldn't let me get other half of magnet in the tree hole.  Seems like I only have problems with games I pay for.  I'm starting to think makers do this on purpose!
B006H8BIIM|1.0|It's a shame a potentially interesting game is being passed up by so many because devs have so little confidence their game is actually good enough that people might actually buy it on their own.  IAP?  Negative.  Free app?  Negative.  I'd take note if I were the devs .... or not.  But you're losing more income than you're making.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So I admit I read this book only because my friend lent it to me, and that it's super popular. The result of reading it left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />I didn't like the characters. At all. Anastasia is such a weak, weak character. And what's up with her inner goddess? Seriously? Christian also didn't appeal to me. I'm not sure what about him that made some other readers like him, but he didn't do anything to me. (No pun intended, obviously)<br /><br />(More detail later. I can rant for quite a long, long time on this book)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun addicting and almost feels never ending.it has various action games which makes it better and more fun.
B006H8BIIM|4.0|a lot of people don't like this but I don't see any real big problems, besides the in app purchasing. -1 star for that. not a whole lot of permissions and tons of fun. but the in app purchasing you don't have to do. just play the survival mode, each time you do survival mode for about 5 minutes, you get about 116 credits. the most expensive thing in the store, is a whopping 2000 credits though. overall a fun game that does not require in app purchasing, but still -1 star for that.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|helps you make plans to read.  also you can listen while lying in bed or having quiet time with God.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|in app purchases are not necessary. fun game, can make upgrades to your station regularly, so what if you need to invest time to beat? the journey is the best part of any game, and this is a good one so far. Thank You to amazon and the developer - good FAOTD.
0312330537|5.0|I alternated reading and listening. It was difficult to put the book down or stop listening. The characters were engaging, even the minor ones, and the Australian and Indian accents were an absolute delight to listen to. If you like \\"Cutting for Stone\\" you will also enjoy \\"Shantaram.\\" The narrators of both both books take you though riveting adventures, beyond history and plot,  to places great novels should lead. Highly recommended by our book club.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Loved the trial versions. however it needs to be for FREE!!!!!!!! more people would probably get this game which would mean more customers. please make it for FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!

B007SYWFRM|2.0|same as all the other apps on fb.  I like the ice age twist tho. but I don't like the fact that when you are trying to hatch a baby you have to keep checking back so you don't lose it. takes up too much of my time.
B006H8BIIM|3.0|Its a good game, don't get me wrong but it is extremely hard to earn enough credits to buy anything. As far as IAP goes....I know this is supposed to be the future of apps or whatever but i'm not paying for anything I can't sell. After i've amassed all these paid apps and spent money in them...then what? At least with console games I can sell them back. Although I hate ads in games but I'd prefer ads over IAP.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is very fun. (hey, I rhymed) It never ceases to amaze. it gives a good challenge and make good jokes. but it takes a long time to get coins :( overall it's fun;)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I was looking for something to compeat with mytown. this game is so much more interesting! east to play but with enough things to keep I busy
B005GHN2GG|4.0|I purchased Master of Crows based on all of the wonderful reviews, but still had some doubts when I began reading it. It's very rare to find an independent kindle book that is well edited and is very well written, especially in the fantasy romance genre, but I found that Master of Crows was both. It was completely original with engaging characters.<br /><br />My only complaint, which is more of a literary preference, was the steamy love scenes. I am a teenager and although I do like romance, the bedroom scenes were a little much for me. Overall, I did enjoy Master of Crows and would recommend it to mature readers.<br /><br />I would also recommend [[ASIN:054762834X Grave Mercy: His Fair Assassin, Book I (His Fair Assassin Trilogy)]] to anyone who enjoyed Master of Crows. It has a similar feel, but isn't too similar.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|I think this is my favorite record of SS. Great sounds and beats.<br />A lot of favorites songs in this album. Somewhere is awesome and Keep your shoes on is pure fun.<br />Ballads are deep and the lyrics well done.<br />I get disappointed when i received my order cause i don't really like the paper boxes for a CD.<br />The booklet is ok but i prefer the one on the iTunes Deluxe Edition.<br />U have to buy it. It´s going to be a classic

0345803485|1.0|I wish I could give 0 stars. I have never felt so compelled to write a ranting review before. Can someone really explain to me why 50 Shades of Grey is popular? I heard the hype and read the books and I just don't understand. I have two main issues with it which I will explain in detail below.<br /><br />1. The writing is terrible. I understand that it started as a fanfic and all, but then it was turned into an ACTUAL BOOK. Perhaps I am old fashioned, but I think an actual book should have been, ya know, edited or something. Rather than just saying \\"the writing is bad\\" here are some examples of what I am talking about:<br /><br />A. There are some basic grammatical things like noun/verb agreement that pop up constantly throughout all 3 books<br /><br />B. There was clearly NO research done AT ALL. These are supposed to be contemporary characters, living in Washington in 2011. Yet, somehow Ana has made it to her senior year in college without having a computer or email address?! Also, everyone speaks in British slang and antiquated English. \\"Fair point, well made Miss Steele\\". If EL didn't feel up to the task of actually making her characters believable it would have been pretty easy to set this book in London right? Or in the past?<br /><br />a. One thought I had about this is that because Christian is really Edward from Twilight who actually was born in the 18th century maybe that is why. That doesn't explain why all the characters do it though, and I don't think EL is a good enough writer to do it intentionally.<br /><br />C. Word Repetition - Ana flushes and/or blushes on almost every page, We hear about how Christian smells of body wash and Christian and how his pants hang in \\"that way\\" (whatever that means?) far too many times. We constantly hear about how Ana bites her lip or hasn't eaten EVERY DAY.<br /><br />D. Length. I wanted to finish the series so I couldn't be accused of hating something that I didn't even read. And after the first one, I thought maybethey get better (because I knew they were SO popular, there had to be something redeeming). Sadly, I found the books only got longer and worse. This is where some editing could have come in. This trilogy could have easily been 1 novel. There are chapters and chapters where NOTHING happens. Well, except maybe some sex, which brings me to...<br /><br />E. The sex. I was SOOOOO bored by the sex scenes. I heard all the hype about how these books were empowering women and rejuvenating sex lives and I just kept waiting for something racy and sexy and interesting. She can't even refer to body parts. I mean maybe she didn't want to be raunchy but to never refer to her vagina as anything except \\"down there\\" seems ridiculous in a book that where the 2 main characters have sex in practically every chapter.<br /><br />Now, I did spend some time googling \\"why do women like 50 shades of grey\\". I found that many fans are willing to concede that yes, in fact, the writing is pretty bad, BUT \\"there is a really good storyline in the books.\\" or that the love story is so good that they can overlook the bad writing. This brings me to my second issue.<br /><br />2. This book glorifies abuse (and I'm not talking BDSM).<br /><br />A. The relationship actually becomes MORE abusive toward Ana after Christian gives up on BDSM. Apparently the only type of abuse that fans of these books can comprehend is physical. So, after Christian vows to try to be \\"more\\" and stay out of the playroom, he is cured. What actually happens though is he stalks her, interferes regularly with her work, tries to prevent her from seeing her friends and gets angry or jealous when she goes anyway. He tells her what to wear and what to eat. Ana is constantly afraid of his mood swings and his reactions to things. The few times Ana actually tries to have a backbone (when she wants to keep her maiden name at work for example) and stand her ground, Christian changes tack and guilts her in to doing what he wants anyway. Basically Ana becomes a submissive everywhere EXCEPT the bedroom, instead of that being the only place she submits.<br /><br />B. Misrepresentation of the BDSM community. I have never participated in BDSM (besides maybe being tied up and some spanking) but when looking for an explanation on why people likes these books I found several articles from members of the BDSM community that feel that this book grossly misrepresents the lifestyle. The idea put forth by James is that Christian likes BDSM because he had a terrible childhood and he is damaged. It makes it seem like something only a mentally unstable person would engage in and something that he needs to be \\"cured\\" of.<br /><br />C. Ana hates all other women. Every other female in this book is shown in a bad light or given an insulting nickname by Ana. Even her supposed best friend is constantly being criticized in Ana's head. God forbid a blonde enters the scene and glances at Christian. Ana's inner monologue immediately starts thinking something like \\"Get away from my man, bitch!\\" This just perpetuates the idea that women must somehow compete with each other for male attention and since Ana has Christian she wins at life. Think I'm exaggerating? What if I told you that The only two women in the book not subject to this scrutiny are lesbians.<br /><br />D. I also have issues with the characterization. Many, many times throughout the series we're told that Ana and Christian have certain personality traits, that they are smart and strong and brave. Yet, there is no evidence to support that in their actions. Most of the time what they do suggests they are the opposite. (eg Christian does NOT call the police when his crazy ex-sub stalker is after them with a gun - doesn't seem like the way a \\"smart\\" person would handle that situation)<br /><br />I've seen a lot of fans and defenders of this book saying something along the lines of \\"get over it, it's a fantasy!\\" but I still don't understand what there is to fantasize about??? I've seen it marketed to men as \\"the secret about what women want\\". Are there really women out there who aspire to be in abusive relationships? I've come to the conclusion that not everyone sees the relationship between Christian and Ana as abusive, but I've never seen anyone explain why Christian's terrible behavior is justified. The best I've seen is \\"he just wants her to be safe\\" like that somehow justifies his horrifying behavior. Why this is something women would fantasize about? Would anyone really be happy with a man that monitors her 24/7, flies to Georgia after she told him she needed time away, picked out all her clothes, orders every meal for her, buys the company she works at, does not allow her to meet her friends for drinks, tells her what she can wear in public, etc?

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I didn't read the book and I didn't grow up in the south with a black maid or babysitter. My comments are only about my reactions to the movie.<br /><br />I was drawn in to this movie immediately. I like to learn about new things, and as I was watching it, I realized that this is a topic that I really know very little about. Most movies that cover the 60s in the south focus on the civil rights struggle, extreme racism, hatred, and politics. This felt more like dropping into the day to day lives of ordinary people. People just don't talk about this kind of stuff. Either the drama of the lynchings, church burnings or Martin Luther King take center stage, but these types of stories are very important too! They helped to inform my view of a segment of society (both black and white) that I just have never had any connection with.<br /><br />I felt the love of the writer, director and actors in bringing this story to life. It seemed that they wanted to give it a feeling that only being in MS could create. It felt like a tribute to their past, their history, and the important people in their lives. It wasn't perfect, but it was compelling. It left me wanting to go deeper and know more.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|I bought this movie with some hesitation, I have to say.  It was really nice when I realized at the end of the movie that \\"Harry Potter\\" never crossed my mind while watching this!
B0059XTUB8|2.0|This is a story about a week a young, English man's encounter with Marilyn Monroe while she was working on a movie. The cast is full of very famous people and relies on the viewer's ability to believe that the people on the screen are who they say they are. You can't just say, \\"Hey, Marilyn\\" or \\"Hey, Vivienne\\" and expect us to go along. They are too well known. I found myself having to work too hard to keep track of the story because what was on the screen was too inexplicable. Vivienne Leigh and Olivier were supposed to have wild chemistry. This pair had none.<br /><br />I have seen Monroe portrayed as a sex fiend, a drug addict/drunk, a lunatic, and a vulnerable girl. This movie attempts to show a bit of all of those sides to Monroe and fails. There are moments when Williams seems credible -like during her interactions with Arthur Miller. She comes across as needy and vulnerable, but what made Marilyn Marilyn was her sex appeal and incredible stage presence. I think that part was just wrong, wrong, wrong. As a performing artist, I just don't believe that can be faked. You can't watch someone turn it on and then emulate it. That is something that comes from within. If it were that easy, there would have been a million copy cats. There has only been one Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />My Week with Marilyn is sentimental, historical, and set in largely pretty and effective settings. It's even an interesting story, but it's not enough to make it good when the central focus of the story is just so wrong.
B006H8BIIM|3.0|I got the app for free when amazon offered it and enjoyed playing it, eventually buying all the upgrades for the dollar (OK 99 cents) so from that perspective its worth it. However, I agree that I would never have bought this simply on the whole pay for it yet make it almost impossible without buying the upgrades philosophy. I know pay in game is here to stay but game creators need to get a hold of the greed aspect and we, as consumers can vote with our wallets.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|1st thing 1st yes it's true I'm an Apple fan boy.  That said, I like freedom more and therefore don't much care for iPads; I however really admire two things about it: one, the iOS spell checking is far superior &amp; two, Apple's Pages. I said all that to say this, this is the office suite I have been looking for since I purchased an Android tablet.  It's clean, polished, and has a very nice layout.  For all the good I still miss the spell checking within the app a great deal.  It appears that I purchase one, I think it should be included that's why I'm only giving 4 out of 5 *s. I think it's back on sale for $0.99, for a dollar it's truly a deal.  Hopefully this helps someone.  B Blessed.

B000305ZS4|5.0|Emperor is one of those bands that produce the purest of feelings of a cold , dark sound that we so associate with black metal.<br />There are bands whose music thrills you then there are bands that give you that overwhelming feeling ,<br />Emperor is much more and beyond.<br />Right from the intro Ihsaan takes you on a ride that is EPIC that is overwhelming and yet so dark and cold.<br />The riffs the vocals by Ihsaan drill cold and despair like nothing else.<br />Yes the quality of recording is not that \\"clean\\" but thats pretty much with the sound that we have come to associate with Scandinavian Black Metal sound.<br />It makes the music even more effective at times by adding to the atmospheric aura of the album.<br />It almost makes me run away to some silent place in the wild maybe. :)<br />The music arrangements and playing is so layered that this is loop and play album.<br />A all time favorite of mine and one of those classic black metal albums that sound just perfect.<br />If you are a black metal buff or someone who wants to listen to black metal but dunno where to start go for it .<br />:)

0307730697|5.0|I knew Adam Brown, the Seal Team 6 hero who died for his country. I watched him grow up with challenges that made his pursuit of the goal of becoming a Navy Seal seem impossible. Yet, against all odds, he achieved what most of us other veterans could only dream of. His is a story that reads like best-seller fiction, but it's a best-seller true story. Every patriot must read this book!
0439023521|5.0|I was very impressed with the whole trilogy. The three books raise so many hot topic issues that play out throughout the pages. For instance, the difference between revenge and justice, murder and survival, and the value of all life. It is not until you read the second book that the idea of stopping the cycle of past mistakes in society is touched upon. While yes, it is gruesome and at points very violent, the point is to see what could happen...how evil can morph into something ugly if power goes unchecked.<br />Some have criticized the book for being to over the top violent, pitting kids against one another. But history has shown many instances of societies doing unthinkable acts against one another (the holocaust, Darfur, ect..) and it is important to realize that again evil has no limits. It is meant to make you repulsed at the idea that this could happen, thus perhaps making the desire to insure that it doesn't stir.<br />The main character is very convincing, talking and thinking like a 14-16 year old would think. Kinda selfish, emotional, full of 'woe is me' one liners. She even goes through the ever popular teenage drama of who she wants to be with. Some might think this makes the book elementary, but I see it as a well defined and believable character. I fell in love with Peeta and his examples of unconditional love, but really all the characters are beneficial in their own way.<br />I would note that I do not recommend just reading the first book...because the point of the three books is to show the transformation of the characters, as well as to define moral obligation to injustice. I have heard it said that deep down this is a love story..and to an extent I would agree with that. But the undertones have so much more meat then that. It is a fast read...and it sucks you right into its plot. By the time I reached the last page of the first book, I could not get my hands on the second one fast enough! I would also recommend reading the book before venturingto see the movie. The only thing I did not care for was how fast the third book wrapped up. I for one wanted more detail.  But overall...great.
B001ADQXHA|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums.  When I listened to it on my 5.1 surround speakers on the computer the vocals sounded muddy... too much base.  Listening to it on my studio quality headphones in just two channel stereo it sounds great!  Lol, don't let your meat loaf...
0380778556|2.0|I haven't read a book where I've despised the main character THIS MUCH in a long time. She's spineless and worries incessantly through out the entire book and it gets annoying pretty much immediately. I read this over my vacation so it's been a little while, but I remember there are multiple times where she has imaginary conversations in her head about what people must think when they compare her to Rebecca, but never takes any action to calm those fears by, you know, talking to people. She never talks to her husband about his weird behavior, clings to him like a barnacle, and basically allows the servants to walk all over her. It got to the point where I just started skimming over her introspections in order to get the story moving along. What a feeble, insecure, and mind-numbingly annoying female lead! You'll roll your eyes at how ridiculously timid she is. Ugh!<br /><br />I give the book 2 stars for the mystery in and of itself, which I thought was fairly good - but seriously could have done without the main character mewling every five seconds. :(
B0053O8AQE|3.0|I started watching TWO BROKE GIRLS mostly because of the talented and beautiful Kat Dennings (who I fell in love with in CHARLIE BARTLETT and continued that love in THOR) and was really enjoying it for the first five episodes or so. I thought that the performances of the two leads (Dennings and Beth Behrs) were quite good, and their comic timing was pretty spot-on. However, the psuedo-shock \\"offensive\\" comedy of co-creator Whitney Cummings as well as the female-empowerment/hyper-sexual comic stylings of other co-creator Michael Patrick King (of SEX AND THE CITY fame) do become grating, because the repetition of the shock-comedy loses its edge after six or seven episodes of single and double-entendres, the stereotyping of the diner's meek Korean owner Han (Matthew Moy) and its Eastern Bloc refugee sex fiend Oleg (Jonathan Kite) and making fun of just about everyone.<br /><br />Plot-wise, it's a female mismatched buddy comedy: You have Max, the hard-as-nails, smart-mouthed, street-wisened babe (Dennings) and you have Caroline, the spoiled-but-newly-poor statue-esque blonde beauty naive little rich girl (Behrs). Paired together in a surprisingly-spacious yet somehow-affordable-on-a-waitress-and-babysitter salary as well as the 24-hour greasy spoon diner they both work in, Max teaches Caroline the realities of the world after being ungraciously thrust from her life of privledge after her Madoff-like father is imprisoned for putting together a Ponzi scheme, and then Caroline teaches Max about the business of selling Max's \\"designer\\" homemade cupcakes. It's not quite a 21st-Century female version of THE ODD COUPLE, but it's close.<br /><br />I'm glad that there is a comedy on network TV that has a little edge to it (since that's primarily reserved for pay cable stations like FX, which has shows like WILFRED and LOUIE or HBO, which has GIRLS, VEEP and THE RICKY GERVAIS SHOW), but the comedic appeal of TWO BROKE GIRLS isn't quite enough to hold interest since the sitcom aspects are a little tired and the supporting cast just doesn't have much to offer.<br /><br />However, I have nothing but praise for Dennings and Behrs. They work their comedy very well and have some nice character-developing moments as well. The show will live or die based on their performances, and as I stated before, this is a likeable enough show, but it's not a weekly watch for me anymore.ects are a little tired and the supporting cast just doesn't have much to offer.<br /><br />However, I have nothing but praise for Dennings and Behrs.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|Please listen to this album at least five times with headphones before you critique it. I must admit after my first listen I thought this album was very strange, but I really grew into loving it after a few listens with decent equipment. Standout tracks for me include The Celestials, Violet Rays, Pale Horse (deeply moving song about his schizophrenic mother), and Wildflower. This album encompasses everything that makes the smashing pumpkins so amazing. There are pieces of the old albums in it but it is truly a unique album on its own. Extremely creative music making that is lacking from the industry these days. Please give this disk a real try and I am confident that you will not be disappointed.

B005LLSLPE|5.0|SOA is supremely well written and the acting is amazing as well. I can't get enough of this show. I'm not generally into this specific genre, but the criminal themes in this show are so much less important than the themes of family, loyalty, and sacrifice. Every character has a reason for being there and though there are some bimbos in the show, the majority of the female characters are strong and bad-ass. I would watch this show every day if that was an option. Anyone who watches can't help but get sucked in, so if you don't need another show to watch, don't start watching this one... you won't be able to stop until you have no choice. Can't wait for season 5!
030758836X|4.0|Well, I did it again...I'm thoroughly enjoying this book and then out of curiosity, I read some of the reviews.  Sad to read that the ending disappoints...I'll keep on reading but now I don't look forward to a resolution of the mystery.  I shouldn't read these reviews.  But who knows?  Maybe I'll disagree with these writers...must keep an open mind.
0062213423|5.0|It was amazing! Came super fast and the packaging was good.! I was surprised that it came so fast. The packaging protected the book really well. I didn't see any bent pages or anything! (:
0345803485|5.0|I must say, when I first bought this book I was a skeptic. After finishing the Hunger Games trilogy, I yearned for another great series. Being on top of the NYT list, I thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />After reading the first 2-3 chapters, I was so disappointed. The language and the writing was poor compared to The Hunger Games. It was nothing like Hunger Games actually. Lots of \\"holy f*%#\\"s and \\"oh my\\"s and I was immediately turned off by it. I thought it was childish. So I decided to return it to Amazon.com. To my surprise, they let me keep the book and credit me a refund. I forgot about the book for a month in a half. Didn't pick it up or was remotely interested.<br /><br />.....and wow, I am so so glad I gave it another chance. Because despite the unbelievable characters and so of the sexual acts and some of the language, a real beautiful, deep love story unfolded in front of me. I was captured immediately and swept off my feet by Christian Grey.<br /><br />Yes, I too feel head over heels for Christian Grey and loved the struggles between him and Ana. You have to keep in mind reading this book, that is pure fiction. There are lots of things that probably wouldn't really happen in a real sexual relationship...But keeping an open mind of fantasy and romance, I think you would definitely enjoy the book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I did a update on It erased ever single song this sucks not recommended. I got this for my kindle now I'm sad
0345803493|5.0|I couldn't put down the 1st book so naturally, I was so excited to jump into the 2nd book. Christian Grey completely and utterly stole my heart and I wanted to continue their journey.<br /><br />The 2nd book of this trilogy is probably the better of all 3. I'm almost done with the 3rd book but I love how raw and pure Christian's feelings and emotions came out in the 2nd book. I completely feel apart when Christian revealed himself, his past, his scars, his fears. It was very touching, moving, and you felt the anguish he felt.<br /><br />More than just the love story or the sex, you really felt the two of them growing to love each other, trying to work things out for their love, understanding and compromising. It's truly beautiful and all you want to do is be by the sidelines cheering Christian along, rooting for him.

B00782O7IY|2.0|Basically, it's a retelling of A Star is Born with some plot changes. This movie started well, ended well, and had a long stretch in the middle that was one after another episode of drinking and self-destruction, basically a long narrative of the main character's self-pity. I felt like yelling \\"do an intervention with this guy, will you?\\" That being said, there are some very clever bits of storytelling and acting. The dog was amazing but I was more worried for him than the human characters, especially with all that secondhand smoke he was inhaling.<br />There are a lot of films that play on human frailty as art, but in this film there were no insights or revelations about it, no play on the metaphor of sound vs silent, just one alcoholic downhill slide scene after another. At the end there was a deus ex machina twist that set it all aright, reminding me of MGM resolving a plot with a musical number.<br />If you can keep your aesthetic distance from this film you may enjoy the filmmaker's craft and a few nice story points, like the beauty mark. After all the hype, I was disappointed, except for the dog, who was great.

0345803485|5.0|I thought this book was GREAT!  At first, I was not sure how I would like it OR if I would be traumatized after reading it!  This kind of book is not at the top of my list when I choose a book to read.  But...we read it for our book club.  AND....it was AWESOME!!  It has substance even though it is a sexually intense atmosphere for most of the book!  It is basically, to me, a love story.  It is the story of a young man and his \\"interesting sexual preferences\\", a hint about how he became that way, and the young woman who comes to love him.<br /><br />Again, I thought this book was VERY GOOD and I plan to read the last (2) books in the trilogy.  Happy Reading and Enjoy!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|An X-rated intro to the world of BDSM with a so-so storyline. Given the popularity and strong sales ratings/reviews, I expected much, much more. Certainly a better balance of story to sex (which currently seems about 10-90 or 20-80). The sex scenes get repetitive and boring after awhile...and toward the end I started skipping most of them. If I didn't already have them, I'm not sure I would buy the other two books in the trilogy after reading this.
0345803493|5.0|This is an excellent novel, all my friends love it!!! This is a good gift for women especially from her man!!<br /><br />I am almost done with the first book then will be going on to the 2nd and 3rd!!

0345803485|5.0|Its about time somebody wrote a book about relationships with great sex.  I didn't find it all about sex, although there is a lot in there about it, but a book about relationship and psychology.  I haven't enjoyed this kind of humor since Bridget Joneses Diary.  You can't stop at book one.
0345803485|5.0|This is an excellent novel, all my friends love it!!! This is a good gift for women especially from her man!!
B005BY3XHC|5.0|I read this book a few years ago, I got quite a bit of good information at that time. Re-reading it now,  I see a completely new viewpoint and different information this time through.  Very good re-read\\"
B003CN4R74|5.0|Fallen has been my favorite. The Open Door, so-so. Evanescence's new self-titled album is amazing, definitely my new second favorite (nothing can top Fallen for me). The songs are harder than normal, lots of rock and lots of passion in Amy's voice. My only complaint would be that the songs aren't quite as different from each other as they could be. However, that doesn't make the album any less enjoyable to listen to. I'm always in the mood for this CD! I highly recommend it to any Evanescence fan, and any fan of female-fronted bands.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a very good step by step process that really is just that.  There is a lot of information about the nuts and bolts of getting a book loaded, straight forward and easy to return to for reference.  Other books out there may ofer more than this but this is a very good source for effective action.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|I had heard Spektor's music before and thought it was a little too out there for me. When I heard her singing \\"Small Town Moon\\" on the Colbert Report, I fell in love with the song and decided to check out her new album. Well worth the money! I love almost every track, and her voice and style are unique and fun to listen to. I highly recommend this album. The songs are very different - there's bound to be at least one you'll fall in love with!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|games are so weird and bad control and why do you have buy the games it said 101 free games,+25. Weird
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Can't wait for 2.0 for Droid. Love the app makes for easy access to my home computer for important data while on the road. Saves me lugging around an extra laptop.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Norah Jones opens this album with the lyric, \\"Good Morning, my thoughts on leaving are back on the table, I thought you should know\\" - making it very clear that this album is a letter...a break up letter to her former lover.<br /><br />For those of us with broken hearts (this record came out the week I lost my dog) - it will provide the perfect kind of melancholy in which to swim.  Her lyrics are poignant but brutally accurate: in 'Say Goodbye' she sings \\"it ain't easy to stay in love if you can't tell lies\\", only to follow up in verse two to declare \\"it ain't easy to stay in love when you're telling lies\\".  Each song is balanced by a Ying and Yang - sharp empowered remarks towards her former lover, and helpless and unsuccessful efforts to forget him (most notably on 'Take it Back').<br /><br />Towards the end of her letter-album on the upbeat track 'Happy Pills', Norah attempts to say goodbye, singing \\"please just let me go now out of the picture, out of the picture, out of my head, get out\\".  But her conclusion \\"All a Dream\\" is what solidifies that she's left this relationship a very different person than who she was when it began.<br /><br />In order to enjoy the album, you have to set aside any preconceived notions of a Norah Jones-sound, as the production on this is nothing like her prior records.  But I do believe it's her best, because the songwriting harbors authentic emotion and the recording projects it.  When a heart is broken for any reason -- a bad break up, a lost loved one, a stinging rejection -- we tend to internalize the consequences and re-run the preceding events in our heads.  So if you can't keep your mind from obsessing, 'Little Broken Hearts' can serve as a great soundtrack for getting through the very difficult time.
B007V508CC|5.0|So from the reviews here I can see that different people really have different perception to music. For me, this album is easy listening, that you can catch up with the melody and relaxing mood easily. And it is what I expect from pop music.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ummmm I just want points but it is a really fun game and I like it soooo yeah I hope you like it too
B00782O7NE|4.0|Who says they don't make them like they used to?  Well, now they do!  I'm so glad this won the best film oscar.. perhaps it will trigger a comeback for nostalgia in films.  You certainly don't have to be a silent film lover or a fan of period films to enjoy this picture, although I'm sure that helps.  While most movies nowadays would delve into heavy computer generated imagery to re-create the era, this film seems to completely aviod that pitfall, or at least from what I could tell.  Funny thing... the cinema world converted to panoramic films all in the name of art, and now to see film makers switching back to the full screen ratio and all in the name of art again I find very ironic.  Just sit back and enjoy.  You'll laugh at the surprise ending too!
B007QNRMUU|5.0|I just started to get familiar with Jason Mraz.  I'd heard his name, heard some of the radio favorites, The Remedy, I'm Yours, but I never really paid attention.  I thought he was going to be more like Justin Timberlake, et al, not that there's anything wrong with them, just not my taste.  But than I saw Storytellers, which has familiarize me with other execellent musicians in the past.  It got my attention!  On the strength of Storytellers, I bought \\"Love is a Four Letter Word\\", I was really impressed!  I love the infusion of influences, pop with jazz, reggae.  Love it.<br /><br />I couldn't get enough, so I bought his three other studio records, which I've been listening to non stop!  All just as good.  I read reviews that say\\"Love...\\", is weaker than his former records.  I don't thing so.  While I love \\"Waiting for my Rocket\\", \\"We Sing, We Dance...\\", I think \\"Love..\\" represents were he is in life today.  His enjoying his blessings, and appreciating life. And well, maturing.  A positive upbeat view, something we don't get enough of in this negetitive world.<br /><br />He's an amazingly incredible talent.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game! its not the typical game. you play arcade games to get poknt then unlock  more games and the games appeal to everyone that has playedit on my kindle
B00881VLCE|5.0|this is the best game in the world except my sis snuck on here and clicked on the scary puzzles the are scary
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great game to exercise your mind. Increases in difficulty nicely. Graphics are good, very nicely done background images. This would be a good game for kids as well, teaching them to think logically in a way not usually used in schools any more. Well worth the download.
B005FIO3PU|3.0|Seller sent on time, was happy with the lamp! The 14 LED's gives a reasonable amount of light, was perfect for my late nite usage to light up my keyboard :).

Giving it a 3* because can not get a replacement and I do not want to take a chance by ordering another one.

B007HO392S|2.0|After the first works by Carrie Underwood, her last CD sounds like the same stuff. Not a lot of originality here.<br />Besides that, the disc is unbalanced: two many slow ballads.<br />I do not think I will buy another CD from her in the future if she does not change the ingredients a little bit, spice it up Carrie!
1936608898|5.0|My copy of this book has started gals in my office to look into the paleo way of eating and re-evaluate their own nutrition habits.<br />It speaks to the heart, well written and easy to follow.<br />Broken into good sections and just overall a must have for getting this country healthy! This will be my go-to gift now for others.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|I have to admit it was strange seeing Indiana Jones and James Bond both playing cowboys. All joking aside these two guys are great actors and worked well together. The setting for the film is gritty and realistic as are the costumes and sets. As weird as the concept may sound at first... you know; Cowboys and Aliens? The plot is almost believable in the way it's presented. I don't want to reveal too much but these are really bad ass aliens and I cheered [inside] every time one of them got blown away. I gave the film 3 stars because it's a simple movie with good acting and production value but there are more than a few holes in the story. It's almost like scenes were edited out without concern for continuity. Even with those flaws I liked this film; it will make a nice addition to my collection
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I had bought the SwiftKey x which was pretty cool but now it's even better, more themes, better keyboard layout,

B002GHHHP6|5.0|Great movie. keeps you laughing from start to finish. James Garner is wonderful. Jodi Foster is so funny. Really enjoyed.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I loved this movie. If you like Jane Austen and love Pride and Prejudice and want to find more ways to get into that world and wonder what it would be like to be there...then this is the movie for you. Laugh along with this young lady as she is caught in the movie. There was some language and comedy that I didnt find fitting for my young children like the original movie but your husband will like this version better.
B0080QTZNO|5.0|Who'd-a-thunk-it. I was most skeptical when 'On Writing' was first recommended in 2005, as I am not a Stephen King fan - at least not of his typical genre of storylines. (Green Mile was an exception). But this little paperback gave me more insight and just plain logical direction for an aspiring writer. If you are begining a career in writing, be it fiction or not, you could add no better informational resource to your library.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This Adobe Reader for PDF files works fine, but it is nothing special. It is just best to have a PDF reader in case you need to use it to open a file.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Although Wool Omnibus Edition is described as a collection of five Wool stories, it's really a singular story with five parts, hence why I described it as a gripping yarn. See what I did there? Except someone else probably thought of the same thing. I haven't bothered to read all 1200 or so five star reviews.<br /><br />So if I had to describe Wool in a nutshell: Think of a dystopian future that's as grim as something you'd find in The Hunger Games, cram it into a tiny vertical city buried underground, and that's pretty much the beginning of Wool. There's lots of interesting characters and plot twists, not that much real \\"science\\", and it's an easy but fun read. I'm sleepy and lazy, so I'll break down what I think are the best and worst things about this book:<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Cheap!<br />* Great original story.<br />* For an indie novel, it reads like a professionally edited book. Either the author had some talented help editing it, or he's just awesome. Or both.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* It ends.<br />* I can't think of anything else offhand.<br /><br />Hands down the best science fiction novel I've read in a long time.
0307474259|5.0|I love this book because the writer didn't flinch from the hard questions that have hardly ever been asked, and he found gold. This is the absolute best book on obesity that I've ever read, and I've read a lot.
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|The first 40 minutes were just so-so. Nothing special, and at that point you can't even tell where the movie is headed. At about 42 minutes into the movie is when the train scene starts. During the train scene &#34;fight&#34;, Holmes is dressed like a woman. He struggles with Watson, and they engage in body &#34;positions&#34; which scream &#34;homosexual&#34;. Yuck. I didn't need to see that. As the train scene continues, Holmes is half naked and says &#34;Watson, lie with me&#34; (i.e., lie down next to him while avoiding the bad guys). Both of these scenes clearly pander to homosexuals and the gay agenda. That's when I turned it off.<br /><br />Was there more of this behavior in the movie? I don't know, and I wasn't interested in finding out. Maybe some people are okay with that sort of thing, but I am not.

0307951529|5.0|Be prepared to rethink your life as you read The $100 Startup. If you have ever imagined doing something other than being an employee to earn money, this is your guidebook. I kept a pad of sticky notes to jot down ideas that popped into my head as I read the chapters. It resulted in 4 \\"expert\\" products that could be produced at little cost.<br />Most of us wait to have someone to bestow upon us the title of \\"expert\\". Chris makes it clear, you already are in some aspect of your life and gives you real examples of how to use it for bettering your bottom line.

0547569653|5.0|Ultramarathons were not even on my radar when I ordered this book via my Kindle. I didn't know a person COULD run that far! I am a vegan and did run my first few 5Ks this year. So, this book was a very interesting read. How does a person not only run one, but multiple ultras year after year and remain in the top of the pack? This was an enjoyable read as the author sought to answer that and several other questions. This was an inspiring story.
B002PEP4SC|2.0|This is no where near as fun or exciting as the Castle show. I love watching Castle and I'm a big fan of crime thrillers but this is definitely a fail. Skip it!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Product was shipped and received by the time stated.  Tube is good for several applications.  I would highly recommend this product.
B0052P5DIC|1.0|One would think that venerated label as Colombia would put forth a better product .I bought the complete Columbia collection of \\" Return to Forever\\" specifically to get the complete live album. Though \\"Romantic Warrior\\" was impeccably remastered, the live in 1977 sounds like it came from the original batch of compact discs in 1980. The sound is muddy, unclear and not pleasant to hear conversely Romantic warrior sounded great. The sound here betrays the music.One would think Columbia would have done more than slap a new essay and put a box around this collection and call it \\"complete\\".You can put lipstick on a hog but its still a pig. I for one was disappointed.
0061537969|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read. And it seems to be the popular theme of these reviews. As soon as you read the first sentence, you're in. I am a HUGE animal lover and thought this would be great coming from the perspective of the dog. I did not realize how intelligent and sentimental and loving this dog actually was. This book had you completely enveloped in the lives of the characters. Sometimes so much you forgot you were even reading, it almost could play out right before your eyes. I will agree with another review i read that said \\" I laughed and I cried\\". You will. Both are guaranteed. I love this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|ice age village is a great game. my 6 year old loves to play this. maybe they will have new add one when the move comes out that could go with this game.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app. I never thought I'd like reading a book on a screen, I'm a 'page-turner'. My daughter has a Kindle and I read a book she had downloaded while we were on a road trip and actually enjoyed it. This app makes my Xy Board just like her Kindle.[[ASIN:B00765ZYTY Motorola Xyboard 10.1 16GB Tablet]]
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|nothing ever changes with these cats, yeah there might be a more electronica or a more accesible tone and feel, however these albums after a while all sorta run into each other and this album shows  how much they are lacking in the songwriting department and there isn't any depth to what they  are putting out.  still they are smart enough to make material that still got them over and its worked, however for how much longer? this  album is  just kinda there with nothing that remotely stands out.  they been on cruise control for the past few albums and its wearing thin.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I didn't get a lot of work done while reading this, because I couldn't put it down. This is an amazing story set in a richly adorned post-apocalyptic world. The characters are as complex as the story itself. I'm moving straight on to Hugh Howey's other work.

B006RXQ27O|5.0|I had an instant video credit and decided to use it on this movie. And I'm glad I did! I forgot how great this movie is. It's so fun to see all your favorite cartoons together.

Their player is really user-friendly, and the video is stored right there for future viewing. Overall, great experience!

B0088XXCZ6|1.0|I have listened to this album in its entirety several times.  This music is very different than her earlier work.  This album is a bit strange and very difficult to listen to.
B000002LR6|5.0|Ministry is, by most means, the first Industrial Metal band. Their 5th album (and third of this genre) encompasses the same fast tempos and angry growled vocals as the previous 2, but this time, the song writing meets the top notch performance in a sonic blast of whirling guitars, grumbling keyboards, exploding (albeit, a bit dated) drums, and thundering bass. the first six songs are all Ministry staples: \\"N.W.O.\\", \\"Jesus Built My Hotrod\\", \\"Just One Fix\\", and \\"Hero\\" (in that order of quality, though they are all \\"A\\"s of some sort) give blasts of power that ARE the genre, \\"T.V. II\\" thrashes with riffs that spin heads, and \\"Scare Crow\\" takes the lengths and jams experimented with on previous songs like \\"Golden Dawn\\" and \\"So What\\" to new sludgy highs (or lows, if we're speaking of tempo). The title track is bogged down with an overblown choir of voices, but has similar energy. Corrosion is more industrial and less metal, but that's something to be found on every Ministry album, and is in shortest supply here anyway. And, like on the album previous, the last song is a throw away, but with 6/9 great songs, Psalm 69 hits a glorious and humorously coincidental new high point.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this App!!! I have so much fun playing with my friends.  Sometimes it takes awhile to load, but that is very rare.  The app is woo much fun and its even better that its free!! Soo cool!
B000000H64|5.0|Imagine that Ministry, Cannibal Corpse, and Depeche Mode all had a baby by some weird cross pollination. That offspring would be this album. This album is one of the first to encompass high, clean vocals and low, growled vocals seamlessly, a feat lead singer Burton Bell exceeds at and is not matched by many (though many try and fail miserably these days). Oh, and it's also a concept album, but don't let that trick you into thinking you can't pick any song out of this album and listen to it on it's own; it's no Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. High octane, high ass kicking levels, and highly recommended.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great, simple and effective. Will change a lot about what you thought you knew on the subject of bodybuilding. A must for anyone serious about improving their body.

Granted, they total about 10, but again, more than I've ever seen in any bound book. Did no one think to re-edit for this 'special' anniversary edition? Shame on you, Signet publishers.

B002FOQXZU|5.0|This album is excellent. There is not a single song on this album that I did not like. His singing rap style is very charismatic, his beats are sensational and the lyrics and subject matter are fabulous. The thing that is so unique about this record is that each song has a message behind it and the album is telling the true tale of the life and times of Kid Cudi. This makes the album very interesting, exciting and delightful to listen to. He details both happy and unhappy times in his life which of course is always good.<br />Now here are my favorite tracks<br />Soundtrack 2 my life<br />Simple As<br />Day n Nite<br />Sky might fall<br />Cudi Zone<br />Make Her Say<br />Pursuit Of Happiness<br />Up,Up And Away.<br />If you are a fan of Hip Hop, Buy this. Any Hip Hop fan needs this.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so cool. The farther you go the harder it gets. You have to run from monkey type things and try not to fall of the edge or hit a tree branch. I say get the game NOW and don't give up. Its my fav. game and its addicting. Once you get it you would probably think Ha that girl was right this game is really cool. Also try to collect as many coins as you can. To get more coins you shoud go to the store on the game and buy a coin collector thing. It does NOT cost dealt money but it does cost game coins. The more you play to more points and coins you get. This game is the best so again get it and you will NOT be sorry. Well I hope you won't. THXS!!!!!!
0345803507|1.0|I'm assuming that the only this third part of the book got such a high rating is because most of the people with enough sense to hate the first book were smart enough to not read it all the way through. I guess I had to punish myself. (Hey maybe someone can write about me having to read this and punishing myself, we can call it 50 Shades of Bored.)<br /><br />I was hoping by the third book that this trilogy would take a turn for the good, oh how wrong I was. From the first book to the last all this is just a really long list of what Ana and Christian ate and wore surrounded by a weak plot line that left me with annoying questions. Here are some of the questions I was left with.<br /><br />1. How did Ana supposedly save Mia and Christian's family if all she did was get bitch slapped by Jack and pass out after shooting him in the leg? She didn't even see her, she could have been anywhere. She just passed out. If that's the case then I also saved Mia, because I passed out reading this book. You're welcome Mia.<br /><br />2. Why does Christian have security if everyone and their mama can get into their apartment, his office building and where ever the hell he keeps his helicopter? For someone so worried about everyone's safety he sure does have a crap security team. He can't even keep his sister from getting \\"rufied\\" by Ana's ex boss, he might want to rethink his hiring strategy.<br /><br />3. Why does the paparazzi care about some random billionaire and his wife? I hardly care about them and they're the main characters in the book.<br /><br />4. What's with all the \\"murmurs\\"? Everyone murmurs everything in this book!<br /><br />5. What the hell is an inner goddess? Is that like an imaginary friend?<br /><br />6. What's with all the repetition? Everyone is blinking up at each other and murmuring everything. If I didn't know better I would think that everyone was having spasms.<br /><br />But seriously, if you like repetition and knowing everything Ana eats, drinks and wears this is the book for you. However, I would save yourself the trouble and read the back of a Cheerios box, because it's much more interesting.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|I had sworn off Steven Soderbergh films after a couple of dreadful \\"Ocean's\\" movies and that paragon of self-indulgence \\"Bubble\\", so it's fortunate that I knew nothing about \\"Haywire\\" before I saw it. Soderbergh conceived the film as a vehicle for mixed martial arts fighter Gina Carano, who has an imposing combination of good looks, physicality, and charisma. Soderbergh filmed, directed, and edited the film, but he did not write it. That job went to Lem Dobbs, who gives us a storyline sufficiently convoluted that it gives the audience the impression it is watching a spy thriller. But this is basically a chase film, with a great cast, that showcases Gina Carano's charms and skills in a series of great hand-to-hand combat scenes.<br /><br />Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is on the run in the car of a young man named Scott (Michael Angarano), who happened to be available when she was attacked by ex-colleague Aaron (Channing Tatum). As she drives with injured arm, she tells Scott why and from whom she is running. It began in Barcelona, where Mallory was sent by her employer Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) to rescue a dissident journalist who had been kidnapped. All went well; the team split up and headed home. But experiences on her next  job in Dublin led Mallory to believe that she's being set up. Government agent Alex Coblenz (Michael Douglas), who contracts with her security firm, seems to know this but is more interested in discovering Kenneth's motives than in helping Mallory.<br /><br />I admire the spareness of this film. \\"Haywire\\" is only 93 minutes long. No CGI. No explosions. Just running, fighting, a car chase, and some tantalizing scenes in which Mallory interacts with fellow contractors. They never trust one another. Female action heroines don't usually make much of an impression. The exceptions are Sigourney Weaver of the \\"Alien\\" franchise and Angelina Jolie, who has had moderate success as an action star. Both of those women are tall, with features striking enough to hold their own onscreen beside men and artillery. Gina Carano goes one better, as she is really a fighter. She does action in real life. I love the visceral quality of \\"Haywire\\"s fights.<br /><br />I especially love Mallory's fight in a cocktail dress.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|This was a cute story, not quite what I was expecting from the cover (with all the pink I thought it would be more like the Shopaholic series - no I didn't read the blurb!), but it was nonetheless a fun beach read.<br /><br />The good: cute story, fun characters, and a good Voice. Good character devlopment. It was nice to see Rose grow up, and the author hit on some very difficult issues of domestic abuse (Trigger Warning).<br /><br />The bad: predictable... this is the same plot you've seen in almost every Small Town Mystery With a Pretty Girl ever. It's not breaking any new ground.<br /><br />Verdict: Perfect for a beach read or something to flip through while the kids are in swim lessons.

B000GG4Y32|4.0|Upon a re-watch of REDS after more than a decade, I came to many conclusions.<br /><br />Politics are irrelevant.  The film is very well made.<br />Engaging story with excellent interviews serving as the Greek chorus.<br />Absolutely impeccable lighting and photography from Vittorio Storaro.<br />Well acted, edited and directed.<br /><br />You know, like a good piece of journalism, the lead is incredibly important.  In the context of this film, the lead, in the form of Warren Beatty, is incredibly weak.  There are many unique faces to grace the screen in REDS.  In stark contrast, Beatty is a mousy and forgettable presence.  There are a lot of great actors in REDS, but Beatty isn't one of them.

B0067TGSOK|1.0|When I read the preview, thought it would be of interest. When I began reading the book, it jumped from topic to topic and I found no relevance as a reader to my life or experience. I did not want to waste more of my time on improbable situations as related to my life. I stopped reading very early in the book...
B003MOHX8S|5.0|What a find!  I never realized that there are composers who are writing epic film scores, without a film!  Being a great lover of film scores, and especially epic action scores from the likes of Hans Zimmer, John Powell and Steve Jablonsky, when I listened to some tracks I was amazed and a little confused.  Why do these sound like film scores, with no accompanying film?<br /><br />I didn't really care, I just bought it, and I've been playing the hell out of it.  I then bought their other album, \\"Archangel\\", which too I'm wearing out.<br /><br />Great epic sounds, great melodies, excellent orchestration and arranging, just all around great listening music.

Christian is a horrible character and the girl is just dull and boring.  The sex is the same thing repeated over and over.  I started skimming pages as I was so bored.  How this is so popular is beyond me.

B007KZY1YY|1.0|I felt like I had to continue reading purely to see what happened after the first book.  Why did I do this to myself a second time!  I didn't think it was possible for a book to be duller than the first one but this one triumphed.  There is a sex scene every 5-10 pages and not much else so I found myself skimming pages hoping it would get better.  The boring and lacklustre story just gets worse and then right at the end of this one, the author decided to throw in another baddie just so she could write a trilogy.  I won't be fooled again and will not read any more!  Awful awful trash.  If you want good raunchy fun read some Jackie Collins!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|A fascinating look into the early years of Manson. It really gives you a look inside the person not just the entertainer. Any true Manson fan will enjoy this book!
034580404X|5.0|Being on the bottom of the world often means we are a little behind the UK, America,and even Australia, so seeing all of my families and friends constantly facebooking about the elusive Christian Grey really peeked my imagination.  I looked in the local bookshops to no avail, so was forced to purchase the trilogy through my Kindle.<br /><br />Being a literary fan in general, whenever a new best seller is released, I tend to be first in line to get the books, whether they are by my favourite author Janet Evanovich, or by any of the more recent literary phenomenons.<br />However, this one stopped me in my tracks.<br />The first few pages had me thinking, 'oh my goodness, another Mills & Boons type romance', like the ones I read during my teens.  But as I got further into the storyline I couldn't put the books down.<br />Come bedtime and my Kindle was charged, bedside light on, and I'd curl up and read about Anastasia and Christian's exploits, often through until one, two o'clock in the morning.<br /><br />To a large extent I have always been relatively prudish in my approach to the more adventurous aspects of sex, so I frequently cringed at their antics, but I was also able to see the way in which their relationship developed, enjoying the step by step progress it took, sometimes at an alarmingly rapid way and others in a far more tentative manner.  It was sad realising that this beautiful man had such a sad past, incredibly touching in the way the author gradually revealed the many secrets behind him.<br />I never thought I would 'jump on the bandwagon' as so many people have said, but actually, I found myself chuckling at the 'inner goddess' and her opinions and antics, shifting from cheerleader to bossy britches.<br /><br />E L James, thank you so much for bringing me a week of enraptured reading, and for introducing Christian and Anastasia into my life.  I can now empathise with the suggestion that finishing a book series is like losing best friends, because suddenly you can only imagine the route their lives take, instead of being able to lose yourself in a book that tells you all about them.  Well done, I will recommend it, and actually reckon there are a few men out there who could learn a whole lot from this series.<br />I do agree that the Kindle price is overpriced however, having spent the same amount on these books as I have on academic text books.  I would have preferred to pay for the series in hard back than have to pay the amount I did for the Kindle books, but I haven't found them here yet.

B006LSZECO|5.0|First off, let me say that I am a fan of the mystery/suspense/ thriller genres, which is why I could not wait to read this book.  However, Gone Girl is like nothing I have read before!  I absolutely could not put this book down to go to work, and when I did, all I could think about was getting back home to read some more!<br />The characters were fantastic, the dialogue was witty and brilliant, and the story was unique and clever.  It was strange though, you never really knew whose side you were on; you never had a clear hero or villain dynamic there (which I found both unnerving and refreshing). I also loved that I didn't know how it was going to end! I throughly enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it.
1608193381|5.0|The book is a highly readable debunking of some of our most popular free market myths, twenty-three, to be exact. Each point gets about ten pages of critique. Examples include: \\"Free Market Policies Rarely Make Poor Economies Rich\\" and \\"We Do Not Live In A Post-Industrial Age\\". Importantly, the book is not a wholesale effort at refuting the capitalist idea. He tolerates the basic idea of a market-driven economy as the least worst of the alternatives. However, he also points out how in many cases the unregulated market produces detrimental outcomes, contrary to popular nostrums. No particular expertise in economic theory is required since his findings can be rendered in plain English, which he happily employs. All in all, the book doesn't cut deep, but does cut in revealing places. And given the recent de-regulation debacle, it's a timely work indeed.

B000KIPT30|5.0|I purchased two of these inexpensive headphone amps, and tested both with full loads on them (4 headphones on each - or, to be precise, the one detached side of 4 headphone sets, as in a recording studio). The two leads from the mixer out to the phones were each 4 meters long, and the headphone cables themselves were each 2 - 4 meters long. There was still plenty of clear signal without any amplifier noise. So, so far so good. I forgot to ask the supplier for 220v transformers instead of 110v - hopefully I'll pick up a pair.
0670023329|5.0|The world inside Camp 14 could almost be the setting of a dystopian novel, except no author could be so cruel. Truth is stranger than fiction, and much more disturbing.<br /><br />Escape from Camp 14 tells the incredibly story of a Shin Dong-hyuk, his life inside a prison labor camp in North Korea and his miraculous escape. As the product of two prisoners being \\"awarded\\" each other for good behavior, Shin was born a prisoner, and Camp 14 was the only world that he ever knew of. He never knew of love, and instead, only knew of hate, starvation, and brutality. He learned to survive with thievery, betrayal, paranoia, and fierce distrust. As horrific as the physical tortures portrayed in this book are, the psychological ones are worse.<br /><br />About halfway through the book, Shin decides to escape -- finally treating the readers to the exciting and inspiring part of the story. The fact that he does escape is no small miracle. It's not just the physical constraints that are in his way, but the psychological ones. He's never known of a world outside of Camp 14. He's never known any other society. And yet, he prevails. He escapes to China, and then South Korea, and then ultimately to the US. Still, through it all, he faces tremendous hardships trying to assimilate into normal society.<br /><br />Escape from Camp 14 is an emotionally difficult book to read. The depths of human depravity are astounding. But as difficult as it is, I think it's an important one. It's a short read (less than 200 pages), and it brings light to significant ongoing atrocities that deserve more attention. Auschwitz existed for three years; the camps in North Korea have existed for fifty and they still exist today.

A great price on a classic rock band that changed music forever, may you please welcome, The Beatles!
B005LAIGW8|3.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />This was another film I missed when it was in theaters, but in a way I'm kind of glad. I didn't know it was from the creators of \\"Crank\\" until I saw it on the cover. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed Crank in all its awkwardness, but that style of film doesn't work well with Ghost Rider. It literally felt like Ghost Rider and Crank had sex and this is what they gave birth to, it's really weird.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" is the sequel to 2007's \\"Ghost Rider\\" It starts off with a little comic animation briefly going over the history of Ghost Rider which is good for those who may have missed the first film. I thought that was kind of cool. First thing I noticed once the film started was the lack of Eva Mendes. So from the get-go I was already a little disappointed. As the film progresses not only is there a lack of Ms. Mendes, but it falls victim to a pretty bad story and some awful acting. I felt Nicholas Cage did a pretty good job in the original film, but here he just seems really bad. He looks weird, and his acting is very poor.<br /><br />I also noticed that they used a different person to play the Devil, but they kind of explain this further in the story. That the devil can take the body of any individual he pleases. I personally felt Peter Fonda did a better job in the original, but nothing you can do about that now. The story is basically about the devil trying to transfer his essence into the body of this little boy, his spawn, Danny. Johnny Blaze (Cage) makes it his duty to make sure this doesn't happen.<br /><br />Visually the actual Ghost Rider looks phenomenal and is a big improvement from the original, but the style of filming that was present in the Crank films, is present in here. It's very odd and consists a lot of slow motion, and sped up sequences. It's honestly something that's hard to explain in text.<br /><br />Overall Score: 5/10 - Honestly if you're looking for a good action film then I suggest you give this a try, but if you're looking for a film with a good story, good acting, and good filming then I recommend you skip this. As I said the Ghost Rider looks amazing, but the story is really bad, and unfortunately is paired with some terrible acting. Had they gotten the original writers from the first film, and used the Ghost Rider in this film the end result would've been a much better experience.

Last I checked, the board game was about ships going to war, not aliens invading Earth(watch transformers 1-3 if you need that appetite sated). When the alien-fighting was happening, honestly it gave me a headache and was making me beg for it to stop.<br /><br />Go ahead and say \\"thats just hollywood being realistic\\", but to me this was a movie that gave not just fad-based topics like this a bad name, but to movies in general! Sorry, Liam Neeson. This isn't your fault.

B007SGM084|1.0|After hearing so much gush about these books I spent the $30 on the trilogy to be very much disappointed. The books sounded dark and mysterious from their description but in reality they are just another \\"happily ever after\\"  teenage dream. At first the sex scenes are interesting but after the first book I just started skimming over them, after reading about them having sex 10 times a day it starts to get old. The book is completely unrealistic, a 22 year old girl has a billionaire fall in love with her, who is the best looking and most talented man in the world and they get married and live happier ever after in their mansion with 2 kids.....the end!! BORING!
B003L16FAE|5.0|Bottom line: This Ultimate Hunter Edition on BD has the best picture of all of them. Crystal Clear. Great sound. Movie the most manly and macho movie ever besides almost everything else Arnold has done. Best one liners in history:<br /><br />\\"Stick Around!\\" \\"Knock Knock\\" \\"I'm gonna bleed you real good\\" \\"That's not your style, Dillion\\" etc. etc.<br /><br />But seeing this awesome quality (Yes it is a better picture than the 2004 special edition dvd) is like seeing the movie for the first time.<br /><br />Pancho, Dillion, Mac, Blaine, Dutch, Billy and the rest of the gang are unstoppable. The Predator is a bad ass. Predator 2 one of the greatest follow-ups in history.<br /><br />You know the rest.<br /><br />Plus watching old painless in action destroying a mile of jungle is the most macho thing ever. MEN RULE!

B001230JXC|5.0|Depeche Mode's VIOLATOR represented a lot of things.  Specifically, it noted the reinvention of a new-wave band from the 80's and the signal of a changing tide in popular music.  It created controversy with its lead single \\"Personal Jesus,\\" but it also introduced the world to a dark brand of electronic based pop music.  VIOLATOR has long been regarded a classic for alternative music, and in 2006, it was remastered for the modern digital era.<br /><br />Depeche Mode's tone is VIOLATOR is darker than in previous albums.  It's mostly electronic: sometimes funky, sometimes trippy, sometimes dance-based.  The opening \\"World in My Eyes\\" is a great example of a dark, dance tune.  Elements of guitar, bass, and drums carry the album, but it is perpetuated with dark synthesizers.  This edition of the album comes with 6 songs that were originally unreleased with the album: \\"Dangerous,\\" \\"Memphisto,\\" \\"Sibeling,\\" \\"Kaleid,\\" \\"Happiest Girl,\\" \\"Sea of Sin.\\"  These songs are pretty good (though not quite as good as the original tracks), and definitely worth seeking out for those who missed out on them the first time around.<br /><br />VIOLATOR has often been compared to Nine Inch Nails' [[ASIN:B000000GPY PRETTY HATE MACHINE]].  In my opinion, PRETTY HATE MACHINE can't quite shake the sound it originated from -- at times it sounds dated.  VIOLATOR, thanks to this 2006 remastering, sounds quite fresh and devoid of any archaic sounds.  Previous to this release, the songwriting overshadowed the (somewhat dated) production of the music.  Now, we have a remastered version that bring the innovative music back to the front.<br /><br />For fans of Nine Inch Nails, The Cure, Portishead, or the Smiths, I would highly recommend VIOLATOR.  It's a great place for new listeners to start listening to a fantastic and interesting band.  Standout songs to download/sample: \\"Personal Jesus,\\" \\"Enjoy the Silence,\\" and \\"Policy of Truth.\\"  I highly recommend this album, especially in its 2006 remastered digital state.al state.

B0083GDLL8|5.0|Short Review:<br />David Bowie's ZIGGY STARDUST has gone through tons of remasters.  Since the digital era has taken off, we've really been only privy to the 1999 edition; it was a serviceable mastering if a bit compressed.  This new 40th anniversary edition sounds fantastic.  I'm not much of an audiophile, but it is easy to tell the difference between the two.  If you don't own this album, this is the version to buy.  If you already own this album, sampling the tracks for yourself -- the upgraded sound is well worth the price for this quintessential record.<br /><br />Long Review:<br />It would be hard to say anything about THE RISE AND FALL OF ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS that hasn't been said already. Most of what you've heard is true: it's a concept album about an alien creature that visits Earth in an attempt to save it (and humanity) from itself. If this sounds esoteric, there's no need to worry; the songs here are grounded in excellent songwriting and craftsmanship.<br /><br />In retrospect, it's hard to imagine that anyone could really top HUNKY DORY. In its time, the album solidified as a genuine artist and not just another one-hit wonder. HUNKY DORY is filled with fantastic songs -- it was one of the best and most consistent albums released. To follow this up, instead of revisiting that same creative process, Bowie created an alter ego to create his next album. A risky move to be sure, but one that would soon pay dividends. ZIGGY STARDUST is 11 songs of fantastic rock-n-roll. It earns its \\"Glam\\" title primarily for the approach that Bowie took for it (costumes, theatricality, etc...), but make no mistake, there's just as much substance here as there is style.<br /><br />ZIGGY STARDUST begins with the amazing \\"Five Years.\\" The song tells a story of a young man who discovers the end of the world has been announced. The lyrical imagery used here is poetic, vivid, and captivating. The entire song works itself up to a great crescendo and ends with the shouting refrain \\"We've got five years!\\" This song has a sense of urgency and immediacy that carries throughout the album until its final notes. \\"Moonage Daydream\\" is a fantastic, catchy song that ends with a fantastic spacey guitar solo via Mick Ronson. It gives way to \\"Starman,\\" perhaps the biggest off the album. The chorus of the song borrows heavily from \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\\" but that's fine. Instead of blatantly stealing, Bowie has repurposed this chorus. The fact that it IS \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" is significant to the lyrical content of the song.<br /><br />The album ends with the 1-2-3 punch of \\"Ziggy Stardust,\\" \\"Suffragette City,\\" and \\"Rock & Roll Suicide.\\" If the first 8 songs recount the \\"rise\\" of Ziggy Stardust, these last three surely document his \\"fall.\\" In \\"Ziggy Stardust,\\" the protagonist loses sight of his mission and gives in to fame, women, and drugs. \\"Suffragette City\\" follows him as he objectifies women. The chilling \\"Rock & Roll Suicide\\" concludes the album, notorious for being the final song before Bowie \\"killed Ziggy\\" on stage in concert. The song follows Ziggy, a washed up, alienated rock star who turns to drugs as he completely gives up: \\"Just turn on with me, and you're not alone!\\" Similar to the pleading repeated refrain of \\"Five Years,\\" we are left with Ziggy's final thoughts to end the album. It's a sour note to end on, but one that is both horrifying and completely satisfying. One thing to note: I may have focused on the lyrics here, but I must stress, these songs are fantastic: packed with great guitar-work, killer melodies, and vivid imagery.<br /><br />THE RISE AND FALL OF ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS is probably remembered most for its eponymous hero. It's important to not lose sight of the fact that this album is a fantastic, creative piece of work. 40-years later, it feels just as creative and original as it ever did. For fans of Bowie, this album is not optional -- it's essential listening. For casualmusic listeners, this album is packed with great songs to keep you interested. This is album is absolute classic on par with SGT PEPPERS or EXILE ON MAINSTREET; everyone should listen to this sometime in their life.

B007EJ6S92|5.0|I've just purchased this release and first off I must highlight the impressive artwork and packaging this double edition has. The production work on this album is outstanding and as always Moonspell delivers top notch goth metal, this time they give us a heavy album (following Night Eternal style) and they slowed down on Omega White giving us Irreligious meets Darkness and Hope style, dark, low paced songs and Fernando's clean vocals all over we all enjoy. Moonspell fans and goth fans in general won't be dissapointed.
0765316994|4.0|This story started with a good feel. The conflict had a Haldeman/Heinlein ring to it and Scalzi's prose was sounding like his best stuff back in Old Man's War. Then ironies started creeping in, and it was getting an edge like Heller's Catch 22. I snuck another glimpse at the blurbs on the back, something I hesitate to do because it can ruin a story. What - where's this going? As I read on the plot started being dragged around by the blurb. Suddenly the story was about something totally different. Wow - this was teleology in capital letters. Five star stuff if someone likes something different.<br /><br />Later in the novel, Scalzi took another experimental tack and, while this reads well, the story wallows. The denouement picks up and Redshirts keeps most of its stars.<br /><br />I can't say I seek out sci-fi that tries to play indulgent tricks with itself. I prefer plausibility, or at least pretence thereof. Sci fi normally isn't the home of humour. But Scalzi has defied all these norms and this book is a pleasure to read. Its nature is such that it contains no ultimate truths . . . hmm, I  wonder. It does help to have seen a few episodes of a certain TV genre.
1250000971|2.0|With this book, Jeffrey Archer joins the authors club started by Patrick Robinson - Good English Authors Gone Bad. The similarities between where the two authors go astray are uncanny. Lets start with dialog. Both these authors go completely wrong when it comes to putting words in the mouths of their American characters. NO ONE in the US talks like how these characters do. And the cliches. Good lord. An elevator operator makes a joke to an English lady about how there's no \\"ground floor in America\\" - its \\"first floor.\\" Bwah haha. How hilarious. Oh Mr. Archer - why didn't you take the opportunity to make the lift/elevator joke? And ummm.. yea.. there are ground floors.<br /><br />The plot \\"twists\\" that Archer is so famed for are groaningly tedious here. A twist is a twist. But when you throw in a \\"twist\\" every 20 pages, it all becomes fantastical. And I'm all for a good fantasy novel - but not where I have to be an idiot to read it.<br /><br />I'm still halfway through this book, and its a struggle to finish. My biggest problem is that I can't identify with any of the characters. It looks like we are reading about Martians on planet Venus. Nothing seems remotely possible. All I'm waiting for is how Archer will cleverly weave together all the different life narratives - but that cleverness is an exercise in tedium. But I'm repeating myself here.
0307719774|5.0|Came across this in a bookstore (was twice the price as listed here, but still... was a good purchase). It's elegant and special. A keepsake. Really fun to answer questions and to see how you change over the years. Plus--beautifully designed. The inner cover has a beautiful pattern designed of swash numbers. The numbers and typography sold me on the book. I look forward to using this!
1449382673|4.0|I've used a couple of Head First books which I find to be generally pretty good if you're an intermediate/beginner programmer. Their style (quirky graphics, notes, and diagrams) may or may not be for everyone. I think they're ideal for those looking to get up and running quickly without having to wade through a 1200 page reference book. And they're up front about it - Head First books are not intended to be a reference guide.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about this particular book is that they didn't spend a lot of time belaboring basic-basic stuff like I've seen in other HF books. That is, I didn't have to skip over pages detailing what an integer was or how a if/for/while loop worked. Another kudo goes to the publisher. They set up a great website with forums for readers to get help from one another. Plus the author will check in every now and then to provide assistance and guidance. There's also a section where you can check and enter errata. Every technical publisher should have this setup.<br /><br />The book also covers some real world applications that may appeal to some: web development and mobile app development. Then again, it may not. And while there are many online tutorials that cover far more material, the HF book actually builds on what you've learned (as opposed to \\"here's a global variable, now here's a inner function, now here's a dictionary\\"). With the HF books you're constantly using what you learned in previous chapters. That said, there are still problems with this book.<br /><br />In my opinion, the author(s) waste far too much time on the now-that-I've-taught-you-the-wrong-way-to-do-it-here's-the-correct-way teaching method. There are numerous times where you're instructed to write duplicate code followed by, \\"Hey, isn't duplicate code bad?\\" \\"Why yes it is. So let's write it the right way.\\" I also question the heavy emphasis on function/method chaining. Yes, it is very cool, and shows off your mad skillz but IMHO it reduces the readability and will cause headaches for the schlub that has to take over your code:<br />print(sorted(set([sanitize(t) for t in james]))[0:3])<br /><br />My biggest complaint: exercises with built-in failures. For example, they tell you to program \\"blah\\" using \\"yada\\" but they don't immediately tell you doing so will result in an error. Most seasoned programmers I know will not move on if they have an error and spend (waste) time trying to figure out the error thinking they've done something wrong. To me it's akin to teaching a kid to rollerskate by putting them on his feet, saying \\"Go!\\", then, after he's crashed into some bushes, telling him, \\"Here are the brakes.\\" There were also several areas where the instructions were a little vague or misleading. I guess I'd recommend anyone going through this book not to spend a lot of time trying to figure out errors on your own - read on and see if the \\"error\\" is resolved in later pages. If not, check the errata page on the Head First website and finally, if all else fails, download the python program from aforementioned website.<br /><br />I also found it odd that debugging, which I have the hardest time in these scripting languages, is hardly mentioned at all. In fact, using a debugger is #1 on their list of Things We Didn't Cover in the appendix. Also, as other reviewers point out, the latter half of the book might be a bit daunting if you're completely new to programming.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a good intro to python. It's not the end-all of python books but wasn't intended to be. If you're looking for a quick intro to the language it's not a bad book. If you're looking for a definitive guide, I'd point you to one of those 1200+ page books.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I loved classic Oregon trail and I love this one too!! a lot like farmville bit with a storyline, I love it!
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|So trite, tiresome, and immature I couldn't finish it.  If you've moved beyond 'Choose Your Own Adventure', save your money and time.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|I really enjoyed the first book; the story is captivating and the characters extremely interesting. However, there is a great deal of unneeded filth, especially extremely explicit sexual content, including vivid descriptions that are often disturbing. Without these bits of trashy and needless sensuality, this book could be a true classic and equal to epic novels like Lord of the Rings. Too bad that Martin's giving in to the sensuality of modern media takes Game of Thrones out of the running. I stopped reading partway through the second book when his descriptions were just too much for me. This is definitely not a book for teenagers or young adults, nor is it a book for anyone hoping for an interesting story without the garbage of modern television and movies.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I have to admit that I held out for this release as I thought the Lost World was a bit of a stinker, but decided to take the plunge once Amazon had it on special offer. Overall, I have to say I am impressed and especially with the audio. I watched all three movies over two nights and some of the jungle noises popping out the 7.1 sounded totally realistic. Picture quality is good, but not fantastic and the bonus is you get legitimate digital copies and not the Ultra-Violet ones that Warner Bros are trying to impose on the unwilling masses.<br />Slight difference between the US and European version is that you get hard digital copies across the pond, where the US versions are direct downloads to iTunes or Windows. Both sets have their advantages, but I like the fact I am not left with unusable discs once I have downloaded each movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What an amazing app. I love the notes that you can add and all of the versions. It is also so easy to find a single verse.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first book in this trilogy is...a good read. It wasn't any sort of &#34;great book&#34;, but is fairly good. Very readable, anyway. Catching Fire was a inferior rehash of the first, and Mockingjay was complete disappointment. The plot was weak, flabby, and way too emotional. I don't mind a little overproduced feelings, but Mockinjay took it way too far. Katniss, the strongwilled girl of the first book, degenerated into a melodramatic wreak. Gail, a character to be exploited and made into a real love interest, became a distant and cold prop. Peeta was way simplified, and pushed under the rug for the much of the book.<br /><br />I gave this ghost of a story two stars, and not one, only because I believe that, as an author, Suzanne Collins can be a good writer. And I think she can do better then this. I think she ran out of plot and cohesion on this one. Which is weird, because you'd think this story would be easy to work with.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game.. all the in between pop ups could go away but overall its not bad! Cant beat the price....free!
1594744769|4.0|By now we know what is selling this book is its use of old black and white and sepia tone photos, peppering the storyline with nice visuals, which the author claims have only been slightly altered.  It's what sold me on the book!  I read that Ransom Riggs originally wanted to publish a coffee table book that was just a collection of  photographs (which he is doing in October - a book called Talking Pictures!), but his publisher urged him to write a story around the photographs instead. The rest is NYT Bestselling history!<br /><br />\\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" is the story of Jacob, a young boy who refuses to believe his grandfather's fairy tales about the peculiar friends he had at an orphan's home on an island back when he was a kid, despite his grandfather having photos of the kids. By the time Jacob starts to believe, it is too late.  So, he sets off for the island with his father to discover the truth for himself.  He soon finds himself in the company of Miss Peregrine herself and her peculiar orphans, and he becomes wrapped up in a war against monsters to help save the orphans and their very existence.<br /><br />The book borrows from the super hero X-Men in that the children are peculiar because of their unique abilities or deformities: a little girl can hover, another can control fire, a little boy is invisible, another has extreme strength, Miss P is a shape shifter, and so on. Throw in some time traveling loop set on replay (Ground Hog Day, anyone?) and some rogue deformed peculiars as the villains and you've actually got a nice story that gets somewhat left open for a sequel.<br /><br />The use of the photos is clever.  I always looked forward to them in the text as I was reading.  There's a long piece as the climax builds without any photos, and I found myself missing them. They definitely help build on the characters, who are otherwise a bit thin in the text, but I kept reminding myself that this book is intended for a younger age (I'm 36) so character development isn't always crucial for that mind frame.  That being said, there's some language in the book (a few 3 and 4 letter words), nothing I haven't heard my teen nephew say but they did make me frown a bit.<br /><br />All that aside, I fully admit I bought this book for the pictures! Ha!  But the \\"articles\\" weren't half bad either.  Looking forward to the next, Mr. Riggs!36) so character development isn't always crucial for that mind frame.

B002PMV9FG|1.0|The Amazon free shipping delivery time was very good and the product arrived in good condition.  But, I was disappointed to find that this dvd of Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince did not have English subtitles.  My wife and I are elderly and have trouble understanding (we hear just fine) the modern movie recording techniques.  It would have been a good bargain but, as it is, I have had to return the dvd and look for a proper dvd to add to our Harry Potter collection.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've just finished reading the last book in this trilogy and felt compelled to write a review. As someone who is into BDSM I expected to laugh through the book because honestly, here's this story about the lifestyle which is actually tailored for the \\"vanilla\\" folks and seems so popular but can only imagine the look on some housewife's face as she reads through the first sex scene. HA HA. Anyhow. The first chapter to me started boring. I couldn't believe the writing style. And people thought Stephanie Meyers' writing style was choppy and novice? But then... I began reading further, and further, and darn it I just couldn't stop, it kept be glued to my kindle (to the point of draining the battery and having to switch to my iPhone and then back and forth as the batteries died). I read all 3 books in 4 days.<br /><br />To those who ask if a teenager wrote this, or criticize it for how unrealistic it could be for some fresh college graduate who wants to be a publisher(and happens to be a virgin mind you to meet this man with a very destroyed childhood who grew up troubled but given everything on a silver platter who became sickly rich and perfect at everything at the age of 26, who barely works... you have to realize, this is a fantasy! Lots of girls/teensagers/women dream of finding that perfect man who will rescue them, provide for them, love them and as they grow up begin to also want a man who will be a stallion in the bedroom, being able to satisfy our every sexual desire and all the while, the man (no matter how many times he is satisfied), can perform within minutes of the last time.<br /><br />I really loved these books, and am disappointed it had to come to an end. These books really kept my imagination going! I think I may be a bit partial as well towards the fact that this trilogy follows so closely to a storyline I've been working in my head for several years on and off, and has inspired me to actually finally put it onto paper.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|It seems that just about every woman out there over thirty is reading Shades of Grey. When asked what was so great about it, several women said \\"it was so sexy,compelling, and very erotic. They all agreed it is a \\"must read\\".  Ladies please!  This is one of the, no make that the most poorly written books I have read. There is much repeating here over and over. Really how many times do we need to read he tore a condom wrapper open? Then again, safe sex is important. However it adds nothing to the story. Pages were devoted to the sex contract also. Again,where is the story?  Upon finishing the book I felt disgusted and offended for many reasons-<br />Not with the sexual content but rather that there IS NO Story here. Shades is so poorly written that it makes one wonder how it got so popular? Ladies this is the 21 century-expand your minds please.  If you want a book with sex and lust at least read something well written and better edited.  Jackie Collins Lucky Santangelo series is a much better read, it even has a good plot. This reader is sorry to have been seduced by the hype!
B003O86FMW|5.0|loved all 3 in this triolgy, a very good story line and good descriptions of everything. will definatly be reading these again.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|When I first finished the Twilight series and was looking around for something similar, I happened upon the fan fiction sites.  I refused to read this then because I think that anyone who can't come up with their own set of characters to write about in a novel is an idiot. Not long after I noticed that Fifty Shades was available as an eBook on Amazon. I also saw it on the shelves in Barnes and Noble.  Everyone started talking about it and raving about it so I thought maybe I was wrong.  I downloaded it to my Kindle and started reading.<br /><br />First off, the author might as well have called the characters \\"Bedward\\" and \\"Ella\\".  He has tousled, copper-colored hair, gray eyes, he's wealthy, drives fast sports cars, he's the gorgeous bad boy.  She's a brunette, shy, nervous, awkward, trips over her own two feet, no self-confidence; she's a misfit and thinks no one notices her.  Seriously? She couldn't even change the basics about the characters?<br /><br />I read the first twelve chapters (39% through, page 151) and can't go any further.  Can you delete something from your Kindle?  What an awful mess this book is.  Everyone jokes about how horribly written the Stephenie Meyer books are - this is worse.  At least Meyer's books are readable.  This is squirm-worthy.  When she uses his toothbrush, ick.  When he drinks the wine and spits it out into her mouth while she's blindfolded, ick. So far, he's only tied her up a couple of times and slapped her once. I haven't even gotten to the scenes in the Red Room of Pain yet, and I can go no further. The Christian character is a controlling, sick freak, and she's a sad, desperate moron to think he's worthy of her attention.  Who would sign a contract agreeing to what she is contemplating agreeing to?  How about for safe words we use \\"nauseating\\" and \\"garbage\\"?<br /><br />Seriously, don't waste your time or your money on this dreck.  There are so many other good books out there to be read.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is a beautiful, lyrical homage to dreams, wishes and the faint, wistful melancholy that overtakes many of us as our lives unravel. The ambience is wonderfully depicted and contributes much to what should be considered a fairytale for adults. It is not an epic series such as Harry Potter, nor urban fantasy in the mold of the Magicians or Charles de Lint and should not be read as such.
B000A6CLL0|3.0|It was a risky gamble to dedicate an entire season to one story arc. It didn't quite pay off. There are many great episodes, like \\"Twilight,\\" \\"Similitude,\\" \\"Azati Prime,\\" \\"E Squared,\\" and \\"Zero Hour,\\" however, the effort probably could have been better spent on expanding on the mythology related to early Trek species rather than creating an original storyline.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|Great quality, great musical. Also, the interviews with the cast and production staff make this an especially gratifying purchase. After all this time \\"Grease\\" loses none of its' ability to excite and stimulate. Watching it over and over again only adds to its appeal. It is a treasured addition to my collection.
B004SEUJKU|5.0|This movie set the standard for all action and science fiction films to come. The special features set up the second movie better. It's interesting how time travel travel is portrayed as a one person, one way trip.
B000000W5P|3.0|This is the last Stones release worth owning.  All the material after this is sub-par - a good song here or there that could all fit onto one best-of CD compilation for the last 35 years.  Yes, it has been that long.  And that thin.  Of this record, Mick Taylor, in a late seventies interview, said something to the effect that he thought it was, \\"a good party record.\\"  And that's not a bad appraisal.  The best song on the disc is Beast of Burden, which is a great tune, and the one song I bought the CD for (used.. this one isn't worth the full price).  To the other songs:  Miss You is the Stones at their coked-out, disco-era best and/or worst, depending on your view of this version of the band.  I enjoy the song as a guilty pleasure at times, but it is not a highlight.  I never thought the band recovered from the departure of Mick Taylor.  Keith can slag him all he likes, but when Taylor left, the band's sound and output suffered badly.  Whip Comes Down is an okay rocker, S&M references and all.  Just My Imagination is also an okay tune, but not something I pull the disc out to hear on its own.  Some Girls is a good blues tune with some ridiculous, and often justly-ridiculed, Jagger stereotypes about women (though when he sings \\"English girls, they're so prissy,\\" it often elicits a smile).  Lies is awful.  Far Away Eyes is a country tune, not as sincere as Country Honk from the previous era.  It has some funny bits, but Mick's over-the-top delivery of a southern drawl with a heavy Brit accent on top of it wears thin on repeated listens.  Respectable?  Another throw-away from the Stones' \\"La Brea Tar Pit\\" - whence much of their material eminates.  Before They Make Me Run is a very good Keef tune.  Not as great as Happy, but quite solid.  Shattered is an okay ender.  I don't agree that it's very \\"punk,\\" as some folks claim.  So, top shelf cuts are Beast of Burden and Before They Make Me Run.  There's some listenable filler after that and a couple of poor tunes.  Prettymuch gets a grade of B-/C+ (especially when comparing this output to far superior releases such as Exile On Main Street or Sticky Fingers).

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This review will be short, as reviewer JCStreetSoldier hit the nail on the head regarding the albums strengths and weaknesses.  He even threw in LP's history, because one cannot understand the depth of this album without knowing the band's logical progression.  If you are on the fence about this album or strongly are consider buying it, JCStreetSoldier's review will do the trick.<br /><br />This album grows on me with each listen (up to listen number six now), and I agree with others who call this a mixture of all of the best elements of each album they have released (even counting the remix albums).
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Well folks, I am starting my third listen of the new Rush. I have yet to read along with the lyrics, so I'm not really sure what the story is about.  As you may know, it is a concept album, and the first outright complete concept album Rush has ever done.  Certainly albums like Grace Under Pressure and Roll The Bones were concepts in that they had a basic theme running through most of the songs, but this one is a complete story, which has been turned into a novel and will in turn be made into a film.<br /><br />In my opinion it is probably their most consistent album since `Power Windows'.  When I say consistent, I mean that I like every single song on the album.  Even more recent albums I have liked such as `Counterparts' or `Snakes and Arrows' have had at least one song I really really dislike. `Counterparts' had \\"Speed of Love\\" and `Snakes and Arrows' had \\"Faithless\\".  And, then an album like \\"Roll The Bones\\" had two songs I really detest.<br /><br />A DJ and huge Rush fan in New York named Eddie Trunk called it their heaviest album since `A Farewell to Kings'.  I have to disagree on this point.  Sure it is a heavy album.  I don't think it is any more heavy than `Vapor Trails'.  And, there are plenty of soft passages to give you a little break.  The last song, which is titled \\"The Garden\\" is probably one of their best slow songs ever.  In fact the last four songs are just incredible.  It is one of those albums that just gets stronger toward the end.<br /><br />The one gripe I would have is the engineering on the record.  I really don't think Rush has had many albums that just sound good since they stopped using Terry Brown as their producer.  I realize that the producer isn't the end all when it comes to sound.  That is more in the hands of the person who does the mixing and then the mastering engineer.  I know that Rush uses a guy named Rich Chycki, who is a friend of Alex.  I also know that Alex has a big hand in mixing these days.  Just because he is a memberof the band doesn't mean he knows how to mix.  There is way too much bottom end to the mix, in my opinion.  As I've grown older, I have been able to appreciate a warm sound, but this is just ridiculous.  I actually had to turn the bass levels down in my car, and they were pretty low to begin with.<br /><br />Anyway, if you don't have this one...GET IT.  It is fantastic!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a wonderful Trilogy.  Kinda like a sexy Cinderella Story.  My daughter has read the series and many of my co-workers.  I thought the book was very charming, with the errors that occurred in the book. It truly made the experience of the book feel like a down to earth person had written it.  I would recommend this series to any adult, man or woman.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Living Things is yet another fantastic album by Linkin Park.  I have been a fan of LP since Hybrid Theory came out, and with every album, the band has shown new growth in their music.  If all you want is mindless screaming, don't bother with this album.  But if you are are open to the idea that a rock band can grow and evolve the more albums they do, then check this out.  It will not disappoint, and I am SO HAPPY to have this album.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I like and admire Ellen DeGeneres. She has a wicked sense of humor. Her public persona is always upbeat. I rarely watch her show, however - I am not a daytime TV watcher. I never read anything she authored before Seriously...I'm Kidding.<br /><br />This is a great beach book. Chapters are short. There is no detailed plot. In fact, there is no plot at all. The book is a series of short chapters on various ideas and experiences Ellen decides to share with us. Sections cover everything from her Cover Girl persona, Family, Dreams and My Bucket List to more esoteric topics such as Honesty and Pondering. Some of the chapters are plain funny and satirical, such as Timeline of a Celebrity's Day and Meditation.<br /><br />There are useful nuggets of information on how to live our lives and be the best person we can be. The book is a kind of instructional guide on how not to sweat the small stuff and go out and live life, enjoy life and do not be afraid to be the person you really are - once you figure out who that person is.<br /><br />Ellen instills her writing and her philosophy of life with humor, wit, and anecdotes, all written in an easy to read format. She does not knock you over the head with her ideas; she quietly comes up behind you, taps you on the shoulder and says - listen to this. You might enjoy this. You might learn something. If not, that is OK. You still might enjoy this chapter...and this book.<br /><br />That's it. I want to keep this review short and to the point - just like Ellen's book.
1589946634|4.0|My choice of stars: 1)Fun: I enjoyed this card game more than I thought I would as I don't play card games. The manual is overly complicated and it took a little time and Google searches to learn how to play Death Angel (but don't let this deter you). Once you are able to get started, the game itself is very easy to play. However, Death Angel is very challenging. Be prepared to die...a lot, but this challenge is part of the fun.<br /><br />2)The educational value of this game is minimal. It does teach very basic strategic thinking and gets the player(s) to make careful choices. Wrong choices can potentially lead to the death of your Space Marines squads. Choices are between 1 of 3 actions to be taken in the form of \\"Move and Activate\\", \\"Support\\", and \\"Attack\\". Only one of these actions can be done per turn and each action cannot be repeated on your next turn. (i.e. If you \\"Attack\\" on turn 1, you can't \\"Attack\\" again till your 3rd turn; you'd have to choose one of the other two actions for your 2nd turn.) So, choose carefully.<br /><br />3)The durability of the cards are okay. I suppose they're just as good as regular playing cards. Its suggested that protective sleeves should be bought as constant playing can lead to normal wear and tear of the cards. Most suggest these sleeves([[ASIN:B0035CYCH2 USA Chimera Game Sleeves 57.5 X 89 MM (100 pack) (Orange)]]) as a good fit for the Death Angel card game, but I have not tried them as yet.<br /><br />4)Overall, if you enjoy card games and/or enjoy the Warhammer 40,000 series, I would suggest that you get this game. Also, the feel of the game or perhaps the atmosphere of it reminds me of the Alien series started by Ridley Scott. Its a great game for both single player and multiplayer(up to 6 players). However, you could play a six player game by yourself if you wanted a greater challenge.<br /><br />As of the writing of this \\"review\\" (my subjective opinion), there are four expansions for the base game. These expansions giveoptional add-ons that could increase the re-playability and the challenge of Death Angel.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|wow!!! Amazing game!!! the format reminds me of Mario and I love Mario!!! this is the type of game I have been searching for!!!!
030758836X|3.0|Meh. I wouldn't recommend investing time in this one. It took a few chapters to finally convince me to keep reading. The story is pretty insane so I finished it, but the ending left me hanging.
B0086700CM|4.0|It's an easy game and addictive.  Perfect for just blowing time which is exactly why I play.  Great for keeping kids occupied too!
0385534639|5.0|A literally spellbinding book.  I could not put this one done and am eagerly waiting for Morgenstern's next novel.  The story, characters and imagery were beautiful, heart-wrenching and simply fantastic.
B0086700CM|5.0|A simple game to be sure, but it grabs your attention after only a few plays. Don't forget to use the store for power-ups!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book has received a lot of publicity and i don't really know what the fuss is all about. i like the pace of the story. i don't feel like it drags.  Ana is a young girl and being that she is inexperienced and the story is told from her view there is not the vulgar language that i guess i was expecting in an erotic romance. she wouldn't say ass she would say her behind or her backside. Or she would say he touched me \\"there\\" or my sex.  This story is told as a first person and at times reminds me of lizzie mcquire where her cartoon self comments about things to herself lol. I'm OK with all that actually. lol<br />Mr. Grey was just a bit too much. And Ana was just clueless and had like no self esteem. I really enjoyed the emails back and forth because that was the only time she would say what she thought to him and not just think it to herself. and they also made me lol.<br />I dislike the constant repetitiveness though. it's a bit distracting.  Mr. Grey could be likable even with all the bdsm stuff but i honestly did not like some of it (spanking) and it made me feel uncomfortable. At times it feels like Mr. Grey is taking advantage of a young girl and that makes me uncomfortable a bit. Another issue i had...this man buys her anything and everything and he didn't mind that Ana was wearing Kate's dress and shoes on more than one occasion? i find that to be odd for a rich control freak. Once you get past the constant repetition and lower your expectations on simple things like grammar the story could be a fun read.<br />i think that all the fuss has over inflated people's expectations.<br />this book is not mommy porn, it's an R rated soft porn, if that. Triad was porn just to name one (though supernatural type genre but definitely porn). For it to be porn for me it had to be a bit raunchier.  This was just a romance with some bdsm. no biggy.<br />The book is addicting though and i will read all three books.

0743270754|5.0|This is as compelling of a history as I have ever read.  Goodwin brings to life Lincoln and the major figures of the 1860s in a way that is both readable and exhaustive.  Other reviewers are right in their characterization that reading this work is like sitting with Lincoln and learning from him directly.  Moreover, her coverage of the Civil War itself is fascinating and highlights how history could have been very different had certain events turned out differently.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed the book, I agree with others that the book is a bit too long.  At times it is though she analyzes everything from all angles to placate the various interest groups of history.  Also, it seems like she over-quotes as a way to avoid the plagiarism charges that surfaced against her prior to this book's publication.<br /><br />Despite these critiques, readers will benefit by picking this up.  It is a great experience.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I borrowed this book from my local library to read to see if I wanted to buy it to reread later. I have to say that I am very disappointed in it. I rarely ever have closed a book before the 100th page and walked away, but this one deserved it. The characters are best described as perfect mary sues. I mean He is a billionaire. A. FRIGGIN. BILLIONAIRE. He is also hot... and very into his 'bdsm' lifestyle (which if I were to hear of his practices in one of the groups, I would have him banned for unsafe play) and strong etc.... I will never get back the two hours I invested in this book and I have also learned a lesson: Never again read a popular book.

0425263908|5.0|I could not put this book down. As soon as I finished the Fifty Shades of Grey series I bought this. I loved the characters so much better. I actually finished the book and started reading it for the second time a few days later. Definitely a must read! I cannot wait until the sequel!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love playing this game because I like taking care of the animals and my favorite part of the game is when you find scratt and when he run across the screen
0062082353|3.0|It is another book by a Texan SEAL that has found god.<br />The way that SEALs are trained is to kill people, so their<br />politics are simply irrelevant, for luck of a non insulting word.<br />Although there is a constant effort to justify the killing, calling<br />them savages is just a way to dehumanize them in order to make<br />the job easier.  Killing becomes almost recreational, a game about<br />who gets most kills in the unit.<br />Again the BUD/UDT training part is really interesting.<br />For a first person war book it is somewhat interesting<br />For example there is interesting information about how snipers<br />operate in an urban environment and about SEAL tactics<br />A unique part of the book are the pieces<br />\\"written\\" by his wife. A fist person account about dealing with a with the combat operator

B005I6EU48|4.0|I bought one of these hoping to use it with a Nexus 7 tablet, since those are very close in dimensions to a Kindle Fire.  Sure enough, it works acceptably.  I removed the plastic backing that holds the corners of the elastic bands, and I have the tablet attached by the upper-left and lower-right corners.  Since the Nexus 7 has a rubbery back, it stays in there just great.<br /><br />My only microscopic quibble: I'd like it if there was a way to prop the tablet up on a table.  I can live without that though, especially since I got this case mostly for how pretty it looks :-)
0307891372|5.0|I've played the past three Elder Scrolls games. Skyrim, it seems, is even bigger and more ambitious an undertaking.  I ordered the guide (as I did with Morrowind and Oblivion) hoping that the many intricasies, maps, and charts for alchemy, et cetera would be present and accounted for.  This guide does not disappoint.  It is amazing in its completeness and beautifully illustrated.  Well worth the price paid, this 600 plus page tome is the best aid in getting where you want to go and doing what you want when you get there for Skyrim.

B003KRJNBW|1.0|Appears to be an unsanctioned remake of the superior Australian movie Freedom Deep. Why? Is Hollywood that short of ideas? The plot is a clone and many of the visuals seem to be totally lifted from Freedom Deep. Trailers for both are on youtube and can be played side by side and are virtually indistinguishable. Yet one is a piece of art with a heart, the other has Denzel. Freedom Deep's director is making a movie called The Rare Earth, I suppose these imitators will rip that off too!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I bought this dvd from amazon because I loved the series and had it on the 6 vhs movie set. This dvd is of wonderful quality and I loved the extras behind the scenes.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I literally just finished the book. And what a book it was. I keep telling myself to breathe, it's over....<br />I love Stephen King, but honestly, when I saw this and Under the Dome, I wondered what he was thinking leaving horror behind. Man, he showed me! I feel stupid asking that now. This book was one of the best I have read of his yet, and I have read a lot, let me tell you.<br />I am not a fan of anything political or politics. Everyone and their conspiracy theories make me laugh. Then Stephen King comes along with his creative way of telling a story, and you forget the things you normally can't stand, to all of a sudden standing them and being pulled right in!<br />He could rewrite the phone book and I would buy it.... just sayin'.<br />So, what I say to you, even if you hate political stories like I do, or you're thinking he's the horror king I'm not havin' it, well, have it! It is worth the time spent to read this behemoth. Totally!

I understand that abrams wants to apeall to a new audience with star trek, but why should you dis honor four decades of star trek to do it?<br /><br />a lot of fans say that 'the finale frontiere' is the worst of the series, and in some ways I agree, but it is pure gold compared to this one.<br /><br />If bad movies were a crime, jj would have been sentenced to death for this one.

B007B6VOG0|2.0|Tired album, too many repetitive (electronic drum) beats, absolute ABUSE of auto-tune, mixed with a few decent indie-rock hooks.  I bought this album for $1.99, it's probably worth about half of that, in my opinion.  Tracks worth listening to:  We are Young, It Gets Better and Some Nights (even though for some reason this sounds like it would be a featured track in the Lion King with Simba running through the jungle....a few years too late...shame)<br /><br />Save the money...<br /><br />Update:  I'd also like to say that the newest single \\"Carry On\\" is very good.  I still think everything else is true about this album that I said earlier, but perhaps it was worth the $1.99
B0083GPDBO|5.0|With a minimalist poster that indicates only the setting (Seattle), the film's title, mysterious figures in the sky, a tag line \\"what are you capable of?\\", a Facebook page and Twitter hashtag and trailer that appears to show everything but gives away nothing (itself a sly commentary on the current trend in trailers to show everything AND give away pretty much everything) the marketing of Chronicle felt very much like a product of the 21st century, with the requisite dose of virality built in. Whether this was a product of design (I like to think it was) or necessity, as the film's cast s made up of relatively unknown, mostly TV actors doesn't really matter as it was more than enough to get me to see it the first chance I had (a weekday morning in a totally empty cinema) and, more especially, because the marketing under promised a film that very much over delivers (to be clear, this is a good, and increasingly rare, thing).<br /><br />This stands in stark contrast to David Fincher's take on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo which also had a great trailer (though one that was calculated with scientific precision to gratify fans of the novel while still inveigling the uninitiated), a coolly explicit poster and a title sequence that probably cost more than the entire budget of the Swedish version of the film but whose cast was populated with wall-to-wall famous people (I include Rooney Mara in this though she has limited credits, the hype around her has been...excessive) to the point that even the extras look familiar - seriously, Joel Kinnaman from the AMC show The Killing (who would have been the most famous guy in Chronicle were he in it) has a minor part of a colleague of Daniel Craig's Blomkvist (I don't think he even has a line). However, for all it promised the film, though technically beautiful and somehow able to breathe fresh life into pretty stale material, ultimately felt sterile and over-produced (and WTF was Daniel Craig doing with his glasses? No one does that. No one.) But I digress...<br /><br />As others have observed many of these aspects connect Chronicle to Cloverfield (hey, they both even start with the letter \\"C\\" and have cast members who appeared in True Blood!) further emphasized by the found footage style the film is shot in (a la Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, et al). People complain that there's been a glut of found footage films (especially in the horror genre) and some found it gratuitous and/or pointless in Chronicle. I'm inclined to disagree and would in fact argue that it is a crucial aspect of the film and one that connects it to another great, closely related work of pop culture: Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross' graphic novel, Marvels.<br /><br />Marvels retells the history of the major storylines of the superheroes in the Marvel Universe (i.e. Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Avengers, X-Men, etc.) from the perspective of normal human beings who view these beings of power almost as gods walking the earth. And like the gods of Greek mythology they are sometimes benevolent, sometimes fickle and often prone to hubris. This shift in perspective and the resulting scope of storytelling is what makes Marvels great and is likewise key to Chronicle's success.<br /><br />Using the found footage mode Chronicle tells the story of (self) isolated teenager Andrew Detmer (Dane Dehaan) who has recently acquired a video camera to document his life to the nth degree (a not unrealistic proposition given the era of compulsive self-documentation we live in) including the mundane (breakfast), the depressing (bullying at his high-school) and the tragic (abuse at the hands of his alcoholic father while his mother suffers in the background, bed-ridden and dying of an unnamed illness). Bereft of any friends the only levity in Andrew's life comes during his daily ride to school with his slacker, philosophy quoting older cousin Matt (Alex Russell). Alex convinces Andrew to join him that weekend at a rave in a derelict building out in the woods. Matt's desire to attend the party is at least partially motivated by the fact that Casey (Ashley Hinshaw) will be there. She is and turns out to be a videographer herself (covering every aspect of her life for her blog) and we have some nice moments of the watchers watching each other (and so who's watching them (read: us) etc.). Later in the evening Matt and a friend the popular Steve (a charismatic Michael B. Jordan) rope Andrew into an adventure deeper in the woods, where they've discovered a hole that leads to a cave and in the cave a object that gives off a brilliant, blinding light... So as to avoid spoilers I'm not going to give too much more away. Suffice it to say that whatever is in the cave grants Andrew, Matt and Steve superhuman powers and the film shifts gears from teen angst (melo) drama to teen angst (melo) drama super-charged with sci-fi as the three discover how to use their powers and, for the first time in his life Andrew has real friends, bound together as they are by their differences from everyone else - and then things go horribly wrong.<br /><br />The people who made Chronicle, namely director Josh Trank (Spike TV's The Kill Point) and screenwriter Max Landis (uh, John Landis' son) don't just have a keen sense of genre, as they successfully blend several together here, but also clearly know their stuff when it comes to comic books, demonstrated by how tightly pack the film is with elements from the several major comic book storylines (power vs. responsibility from Spider-Man, social isolation from X-Men, anger management from The Hulk, etc.). It's skillfully and subtly done, this isn't some hat-tip to geeky comic book fanboys. Rather, all the elements are blended into a very satisfying whole. It treats comic books as a source of pop-culture reference and inspiration much in the way literature, theatre, art and other films have been used in cinema to date - does this mean we're moving into a post comic book era? In the sense that comics can finally be seen as an artistic medium in their own right? (I like to think so).<br /><br />At 84 minutes Chronicle is snappy and, as previously noted, very skillfully made. The special effects work is seamlessly integrated into the visuals and, given the found footage style feel very realistic until the characters' powers grow to epic levels at which point they feel pretty scary and we're made to feel very human, very...small (What am I capable of? I'm just going to sit here and watch the movie...thanks). Consequently Chronicle succeeds where other films that have tread similar subject matter haven't, films such as Unbreakable (too much insider baseball), Hancock (neither funny enough nor dark enough) and even Watchmen (too reverential to it's source material).
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been playing this game on my friends ipods because I could not get it myself. but now that I have gotten it I can not put it down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very simple yet engaging. This game really understands human responses and keeps you hungry for more. I enjoy it. The only drawback is each game has little replay value. Once you defeat all 126? its pretty much deletable.
B007SGM084|1.0|This should be a pornographic book and it should say so. Don't know why it had to be so much sex. I am not recommending it to friends or family. Very disappointed!! No stars rating for me!!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Two sides to this.<br /><br />The books themselves are amazing. Very compelling, interesting, I loved reading them and couldnt put them down. Keep in mind that they are NOT written at a very high reading level, so if challenging and stimulating word usage is your goal, these might not be for you.<br /><br />The ebook was an annoyance. There were a few random pages missing and there were issues with the font size not changing when i wanted it to or changing page to page.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|I was looking forward to this high definition release, so much that I pre-ordered it, and I wasn't disappointed.  It looks GREAT on Blu-Ray!!!  The sound is much better than on DVD, and the picture is very crisp.  They did a great job with this restoration.<br /><br />It also contains some SPECIAL FEATURES that were not included in the DVD release.  Those features are the following:<br />--DOCUMENTARY about the making of Evita (includes interviews with Alan Parker, Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, Andrew Lloyd Webber, etc.)<br />--MUSIC VIDEO of the song \\"You Must Love Me\\" with Madonna<br />--TEASER TRAILER<br /><br />And of course, as with most Blu-Rays or DVD's, it includes optional subtitles in both English and Spanish.<br /><br />I recently saw the play with Ricky Martin on Broadway, and I realized I like the movie much more than the play.  The original play (as well as the current revived play on Broadway) depicts Evita as a one-dimensional evil social climbing bitch.  Why?  The musical was written by two British men (Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice) who hate Evita.  Britain and Argentina have had conflicts in the past, so it's safe to assume that the story depicted in the play is very biased.<br /><br />The movie, on the other hand, tries to be more balanced.  Some changes were made in the movie to show a more vulnerable side of Evita.  Yes, the film does use the same biased songs, but in a more balanced way.  For example, it was because of Evita that women got the right to vote in Argentina, and the movie shows this through images, even though the songs don't even mention this fact.<br /><br />What bothers me most about the musical in general is that Evita is criticized and represented as a bitch and slut for pursuing power, when men who pursue power are not usually criticized.  Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber are obviously sexist for having done this.  What I really appreciate about the movie is that Alan Parker tried to tone down the sexism andpresent her as an inspirational woman (which she was), in spite of the so-called \\"controversies.\\"<br /><br />Because the movie goes out of its way to be fair (in spite of the unfair songs), I'm giving the FILM (not the play nor the content of the songs' lyrics) five stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|All my friends had it on their phones and then when kindle got it I was psyched!!! Really fun and addicting game! :D
B000RZIGVS|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite TV shows. I'm so thrilled to finally own the series on DVD, as I haven't been able to watch it for the last ten years. Every time I moved somewhere new, I would eagerly get my cable hooked up, only to be crushed when I found out that TNG was not part of the line-up. (There were times when I was on holiday that I would refuse to leave the hotel room, because I was finally able to catch a TNG episode, and I wasn't leaving until it was over!)<br /><br />I started watching it in 1992 because I had a crush on Wesley Crusher (lame, I know, but hey, I was eleven!) So I was watching it because I thought that he was cute, but after about three episodes, I was completely hooked on the show itself. The storylines are just so awesome, and full of the kind of moral standards that define the human race. Where else can you find another show that upholds so many positive messages, about truth and freedom and honor and the beauty of being human, even with all of its hardships, and . . .the list goes on and on. Yes, there are a couple of \\"stinkers\\", (The Naked Now, Masks) but there are few and far between. I guess every series is allowed to fail once or twice.(I recommend skipping over The Naked Now - I can't stand this episode - it's like watching a cheap porno movie! Not that I watch those, mind you!)<br /><br />One of the people who worked on the show remarked that each episode is like half of a feature film, and he's absolutely right. Not many shows can be so moving in 45 minutes, but STNG manages it. I have found myself crying by the end of the show so many times, (if you're familiar with The Inner Light, you'll understand what I mean.) It's just that moving. And of course, sometimes there are points when I've had to pause playback, because I'm laughing so hard (often at a moment where Data makes an unintentionally hilarious comment). And of course the Q episodes are some of the best for comedy. (Watch Deja Q if you want to laugh your head off -as far as I'm concerned, no one can watch Data having his first belly laugh without cracking up.)<br /><br />I bought this set as my bonus for the year, while my husband got a new computer. So the DVDs were technically supposed to be mine, but now my husband won't let me watch them without him there! (Well, he would let me, of course, but he doesn't want to miss an episode.) He had only seen maybe a handful of TNG episodes before I purchased this set. He was more of a Voyager fan, as that was what was on TV at the time that he started to become a Trekkie. But after watching maybe ten TNG episodes, he had to agree that TNG absolutely blows Voyager away. (I did give that show a chance, I watched it for almost three months when it first started, but it just didn't have the heart of TNG.)<br /><br />We bought this set less than two months ago, and already, we're halfway through season six! We have to be watching about 3-4 episodes a night, and as many as eight on the weekends. We just can't stop, they're that good.<br /><br />As you can guess, I was too young to really enjoy the original series. They were before my time. I've seen a few, but they were a bit too cheesy for me. Plus, after Captain Picard, I couldn't like the cowboy style of Kirk. TNG is what I grew up with.<br /><br />Now I'm looking forward to owning Deep Space Nine. (I don't like it as much as TNG, but it's still good.) Voyager and Enterprise, I might what the occasional show if it happens to be on TV, but TNG can be watched over and over. I'll never tire of it.<br /><br />I would recommend getting a companion guide to go with the set. I have TV Guide's \\"Farewell to Star Trek: The Next Generation\\". Not too easy to get your hands on, but very good. It includes a synopsis of every single episode, including the names of the guest stars and a few trivia tidbits. The book also has interviews of every regular cast member, even a few that weren't in that many episodes, like Q and Ensign Ro. It may be a littledifficult to get your hands on a copy (try Ebay, as Amazon doesn't have it), but it's well worth it.<br /><br />Also, it's been said over and over, but beware of the Asian releases! It's cheaper, but the picture and sound quality sucks, and many of the episodes are cut off at the end. It may not be enough missing to leave you hanging, but who wants that? While the Amazon price might seem steep, it works out to less than $3.50 US an episode, while getting the bonus stuff for free. (I'm from Canada, but even with the exchange rate, it worked out to less than $4.50 Canadian for an episode, with the bonus stuff for free.) When you look at it that way, it doesn't seem so bad. It was an \\"ouch\\" to part with the money, but at least this way, I'll own the whole show forever, and now I can watch any episode anytime. Also, buy the whole set at once, rather than individual seasons, you'll save yourself $150-$200. And you'll get a nice little sleeve to store them all in.<br /><br />The surround sound on this set is just awesome. If you have surround sound, you will love watching it like this.<br /><br />There's only a couple of things that I would change about this set if I could. I would have liked to have seen some bloopers as part of the extras. DVD commentary would also have been appreciated. And I would have changed the packaging to an accordian style (like a book) foldout. The way it is now, you have to unfold the holder across your coffee table so that you can get the last disc out. It's rather annoying. And sometimes, the disc holder doesn't want to come out of the box. Also, the DVD chapters aren't set up so that you can just click past the credits (I did that once, then wondered why I'd missed part of the episode). But other than that, everything else is great.

B0085A9HXS|5.0|Lately action movies have stressed CGI or other special effects to make the action work. This movie relies almost exclusively on hand-to-hand combat, much like the action movies of the 90's. Except to put it in that category would be underselling it. The fight scenes in The Raid are both intense and complex. I have not been this amazed by fight scenes since The Matrix.

B007Y2W44W|5.0|That's the message I get from this album, a release that will spark the usual debate over bands who \\"do the same album over and over\\" vs. those who evolve.  It's not always that simple, though.  Some bands change because they want to, and some just run out of good material sooner than others and have to change.  Nile have not run out of ways to turn ancient Egyptian themes into dramatic, compelling metal, and have no need to make drastic changes.  They do what they do with no compromise and no bowing to trends or critics who say they're doing the same things they always have.<br /><br />At the Gate of Sethu is like a combination of Amongst the Catacombs and Those Whom the Gods Detest.  Whereas 'Gods' sounded heavily influenced by Rapture-era Morbid Angel, 'Sethu' refocuses on the classic Nile sound, with more Chuck Schuldiner in the guitars than Trey Azagthoth.  There's also more emphasis on atmosphere and greater diversity in the vocal sounds.<br /><br />I'm not going to say I like it better than 'Gods', which was a freakin' steamroller of an album, but it's as good as that and has more of the old Nile sound.  The song lengths are back down from their last few releases, mostly in the 4 to 5 minute range, with a couple short instrumentals.<br /><br />Although 'Sethu' doesn't go beyond what you'd expect from Nile, it confirms their ability to stay inventive and fresh within their niche.  This album has amazing guitar work throughout, inspired vocal dynamics, and ridiculously sick drumming.  They've proven once again to be peerless in the realm of death metal, tech-death, or whatever other subgenre they're assigned to.  If anyone's looking for more info on specific tracks, read on.  If not, go blast the album and enjoy.<br /><br />\\"Enduring the Eternal Molestation of Flame\\"--Blistering track with lightning fast double-bass and blast beats and plenty of deep guttural vocals like Catacombs mixed with the shouting style of 'Gods'.  Death metal instrumentation at its mindblowing best.<br /><br />\\"The Fiends Who Come to Steal the Magick of the Deceased\\"--Impressive vocal variety with a mix of shouts, screams, singing, grunts, growls...a little bit of everything.  Has some of the cleaner thrash style of the Worship the Animal EP/demo alongside twisting riffs and relentless grinds for constants shifts in tempo.  A total roller coaster ride of a song; for anyone who's been to King's Island in Ohio, listening to this track feels like riding The Vortex.<br /><br />\\"The Inevitable Degradation of Flesh\\"--This could've been on 'Gods', with similar vocals and riffs, plus some insane solos.  It's the third straight predominantly fast song leading off the album.<br /><br />\\"When My Wrath Is Done\\"--Starts out slow and plodding after an acoustic intro, but quickly gets fast, and mostly stays that way.

B007I1Q4W2|4.0|Here is the new twist on zombie movies that so many folks seem to be looking for... Zombies in the 19th Century! I can't believe this was a budget movie... I guess that just goes to show that as long as you got a talented and creative group of folks really dedicated to spending time and energy to their project, you don't have to have a gross amount of money support. It's really nice to actually be able to watch a movie where thought and time had been put into writing a script with believable dialogue. Not only was it an interesting story, but this movie had actors that could actually act (though there was a bit of over acting every now and again which seemed to make the movie overly melodramatic) and a prop and make-up department that actually knew what they were doing to pull off a somewhat historically accurate looking period piece with realistic looking walking dead!<br />On the negative side, the movie was at times a little melodrama! Now don't get me wrong, I can love me some drama, but this movie seemed to exaggerate some of the drama! Maybe I found it melodramatic due to the fact that there occasional bouts of overacting and some of the characters were a bit 2-dimensional and stereo-typical... one major example of this was the rogue Southern General and his molie crew of henchmen.  A lot of the \\"early\\" story line was rushed and told in flash backs, so I never made a strong connection with the wife and son. And the voice over commentary was to me, a tad over the top and annoying. The animated segments really didn't add much to the movie, it seemed to remove reality and add a dream-like quality to the movie.  However, the animation used to introduce each new chapter was nicely done.  And, just exactly where was the main character suppose to live in Tennessee that he could ride for days without coming upon several farms or villages? Tennessee in the 1870s was not like living in the remote regions of Central America! Chances are, if you lived that remotely in thewoods, then you would have probably encountered less than a dozen zombies. I would think the zombies would have wandered to areas that were largely populated, instead of deep into the rural woods. All in all, it's really nice to see a movie where everyone involved put forth 100% of themselves... and created a movie that is much better that a lot of crap that major Hollywood studios have been churning out!

B000ICXQU6|5.0|This video is a classic, and worth reviewing to note the methodology by which Erin Brockovich took on the struggles of a town to legally challenge PG&E's dumping of hexavalent chromium into the water supply. The exposure of PG&E's attempts to buy off the innocent victims who were dying of all kinds of various chronic lethal diseases provides a compelling view of the dark side of human nature. This slice of California history serves as a universal eternal morality tale. The story of Erin, compassionate leader of the victims, is truly inspirational and empowering for anyone cowed by corporations, the system, or any of life's challenging situations.<br /><br />And although this movie is instructive for potential activists, be careful when showing to students. I cringed at the F*** bombs,  Erin's cleavage and a few almost sex scenes. Students will not be bored.<br /><br />Please note: the audio does not quite turn up to high volume.

1455518999|3.0|I didn't think this sort of \\"copy cat\\" was allowed.  I hadn't read a Baldacci book in years.  He was on a roll and every one was a Winner - then came his Christmas Train and I left the author behind.  I'm not a fan of money writing.<br />However, I bought a bunch of books for traveling reads, I included Baldacci's Zero Day.  Well, well, it was quite a SHOCK - matter of fact - I was greatly irritated to see Lee Child's Jack Reach copied right down to the head-butts by Zero Day's John Puller.<br />I've read every Reacher book so know the hero's thinking, habits and patterns quite well - I'm a female Reacher fan - love his role model thinking.<br />Anyhow, Puller is a carbon copy of Jack Reacher.  Zero Day, leaving behind the irritation, is OK because it's just like reading a Reacher story -  I'm waiting for Child's Reacher September release it's in my Amazon cart.<br />I'm enormously  surprised by the Baldacci degree of piggy-back detail similarity to Lee Child's Reacher.<br />If you enjoyed Zero Day and haven't yet caught-up with Lee Child's Jack Reacher yet - give it a try - you absolutely won't be disappointed.

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Captain America: The First Avenger is a fun action film with a lot of heart in it.<br /><br />The story is about Steve Rogers, a young New Yorker in 1942 who wants to sign up to fight in World War II. The problem is he's a 90-pound weakling with health problems, i.e. 4F material, more so than even George Bailey. He winds up in a special secret U.S. Army unit that is working on a super-soldier serum. He is selected to take the serum which turns him into a lean, sleek, taller fighting man. Of course an enemy spy sneaks in and blow up the equipment and shoots the head scientist, so Rogers is the only one of his kind. He fights against the Nazis and their special secret unit, Hydra, that has its own plans for world domination.<br /><br />The movie hits all the WWII tropes: liberating POW camps, jumping motorcycles, flying fortresses, attacking a train in motion, assaulting secluded mountain hideaways, moving plastic pieces on a giant table map, parachuting behind enemy lines, drinking in smoky bars, etc. etc. They come off not so much as cliches but as homages to the great WWII flicks that came before.<br /><br />Chris Evans gives a great performance as Steve Rogers. He communicates the decency and honesty of the character and is as convincing emotionally as physically. Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull gives a good performance though I couldn't shake the feeling his German accent was an imitation of Werner Herzog. The rest of the cast is convincing and enjoyable.<br /><br />It's not a perfect film but it is a ton of fun and surprisingly patriotic and heart-warming without being ham-fisted or overly melodramatic.

B007FZ7R7W|5.0|When I first did my run through of the album, I wasn't feeling it like I thought I would. But after a second and thorough listen, I am now in love with this album. There is definintly a lot more slower/softer songs for Chris on this album and less dance. It's a mix of R&B/Pop and like 3 dance songs. He also threw in a few beautiful ballads, in the mix like  Free Run, and 4 Yrs old. I think out of the 19 songs on the album, my least favorite is Wait for You. I am in love with Stuck on Stupid, Free Run, 4 yrs old, Mirage, Trumpet Lights, Don't Wake Me Up, Turn up The Music, Sweet Love, Party Hard, Remember my name, 2012, Touch Me, and still not tired of Strip!!! Basically the whole damn album is just awesome. Give the album a chance. It's worth it!

B004JVZXXU|2.0|I am one on those who hate the hand held camera gimmick as much as the staged \\"reality\\" TV. The first film I literally gave away to a complete stranger. In this film we discover why the demon comes to the house-maybe. There is no shocking final scene as far as I can tell. The goofy stuff starts shortly after Hunter is born. The house is ransacked, except for his room. So the family installs cameras in all the rooms, as well as walk around with a hand held camera all the time, plus a few camera shots that didn't fill either description, such as the OUIJA board scene.<br /><br />The house keeper suspects an evil spirit is in the house. The daughter thinks it is a demon from mom's side of the family that is after Hunter, and mom thinks it has something to do with the fact her and her sister Cleavage used to hold seances. Dad is a skeptic and doesn't believe much of anything and the dog just barks. This is dad's second wife who seems only slightly older than his bikini daughter.<br /><br />The plot behind the movie isn't half bad but instead of having a sound track, a decent camera crew, and a token shower scene, we end up with another hand held yawner that bored me to tears as I spent half the time watching a pool crawler. OH LOOK! It got out of the pool! I suggest you read the reviews and fast forward to day 12 or so, to avoid rigor mortis.<br /><br />No sex, no nudity, a few F-bombs, no terror, no horror, no blood, no gore.

0062071017|5.0|Cynthia Montgomery has written a fantastic book describing the leadership journey that can help accelerate revenue and profit growth for your company.  The Strategist describes how the CEO, as the de facto head \\"strategist\\", can help his/her company develop a differentiated positioning, map out a strategy, lead the execution of the strategy and then guide the evolution of the strategy and tactics over time.<br /><br />The book describes the CEO's leadership as a journey, an adventure that only he or she can adequately guide.  Montgomery uses real life, in-depth case examples, the hallmark of the Harvard Business School program where she teaches, to demonstrate and drive home key points from the experiences of Apple and Gucci, among others.<br /><br />If you are the CEO or senior executive of a company looking to set your course and then drive for results in ways that are new to your company, I highly recommend this book.  You will find yourself reading it cover to cover in 1 or 2 sittings, taking notes in the margin along the way.  Once you are done, chances are you will refer back to it again and again!<br /><br />Enjoy!!
1400052181|1.0|I love to read and have enjoyed being part of a book club for the last two years. This might be the worst book we have ever chosen! It is long, drawn out and boring.

But this might be one of two books in my lifetime that I will put down before I am finished. I definitely don't recommend this book.
0439023483|5.0|I have never been a big reader.  I never read anything on my own, ad it was pulling teeth to do reports.  I have gotten better as I've gotten older, but when I was told to read these \\"they were really good\\", I was skeptical, and had a feeling, as with most books, I wouldn't finish them.<br />Not only did I finish the books, I devoured them.  I read The Hunger Games in just over a day, and Catching Fire in 2.  Mocking jay took a little longer, only cause I ran out of weekend and work frowns upon you reading while on the clock.<br />Suzanne Collins, has such an amazing way of pulling you into the story, without being too complicated or frivolous with her writing.

B00782O7IY|5.0|\\"The Artist\\" impressed me in many ways: the writing, casting, acting; sets; costumes and more were all spot-on and the plot kept me glued to the screen. True, some may say that the acting was a bit overdone; and maybe these people are right. Nevertheless, I still think it's all well done because it's primarily a silent movie and during the era of silent film it was common for actors to emote quite a bit to compensate for the lack of dialogue. In addition, the musical score enhances this film.<br /><br />When the story begins, we meet mega movie star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) who makes films--and money for Kinograph Studios. George is adored by the audiences and it truly seems he can do no wrong. Studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) loves George, too; George makes Kinograph look great and, as I mentioned, pulls in a lot of money for the studio so they can make more films. George has a close friend in his chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell) who is remarkably loyal. Unfortunately, however, George's life is not perfect--while he and his dog Uggie are very close, George's marriage to Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) becomes essentially loveless.<br /><br />One day after a big premiere of George's latest movie in 1927, fans crowd around him with police holding them back. By accident, a fan named Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo) drops her purse and as she tries to retrieve it she literally bumps into George. George finds humor in this and Peppy gets noticed when a press photographer takes a photo with Peppy giving George a kiss on the cheek. Of course, George's wife Doris becomes furious and George uses his typical defense against Doris by fussing over Uggie at the breakfast table.<br /><br />When her photo kissing George gets into the papers Peppy find work at the studio; slowly but surely she lands bigger and bigger roles. However, for George it's the exact opposite. George initially laughs off the idea of \\"talkies\\" but after Al Zimmer gives him the news that he is washed up at the studio for \\"fresh meat\\" who can talk in films George gradually becomes profoundly depressed and self-destructive.<br /><br />I had a pretty good idea about how the story would end; but this film is so artfully done it held my full attention nonetheless. Jean Dujardin gives a tour-de-force performance as George and I won't forget that anytime soon. The chemistry between George and Peppy is excellent as well.<br /><br />Look also for the film to pay a tribute to silent films with Uggie, the dog who would do anything for his master George; vivid facial expressions to compensate for the lack of dialogue and how it was filmed in the full screen ration of 1.33:1 which was standard for the silent film era.<br /><br />The extras are also very good. I particularly enjoyed the \\"making of\\" featurette and the \\"Q&A\\" session with filmmakers and cast.<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" is an excellent film that clearly deserved its \\"Best Film\\" award at the Oscars. I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes silent film; the history of how movies changed from silent to \\"talkies\\" and fans of the actors in this film will be thrilled. In addition, people who appreciate foreign dramas with some dark overtones will not be disappointed.up at the studio for \\"fresh meat\\" who can talk in films George gradually becomes profoundly depressed and self-destructive.<br /><br />I had a pretty good idea about how the story would end; but this film is so artfully done it held my full attention nonetheless.

0345803485|1.0|After hearing so much about this book, I was eager to read it.  I even bought a second copy as a gift.  I have to say I did not love it.  I did not enjoy the dynamics between the two people even a little bit, and I didn't feel like hints at his troubled upbringing gave him the right to treat women as he did.  And, to clarify, I'm not even referring to the bedroom scenes.  Those didn't bother me, although since I didn't like him, I had a hard time getting into those.  Bottom line: won't be reading the other two books.

I actually found myself wishing there was a fourth book.  The story line is wonderful and keeps you captive.  I would recommend the book to anyone who loves a good story.  But if they are shy and really reserved about language and sex then this isn't for them.  I don't agree with what some reviews call it as \\"Mommy Porn\\" because I have read other books that get somewhat detailed also and no one makes a big deal about them.  This one goes a little beyond that but hey, if you don't like that sort of stuff then don't read it.........just saying!
B0040JHL3G|2.0|The shoe fit well without having to use a stretcher to even out internal bumps from stitching. I'm 165 lbs and 5'10\\" which is medium weight and height. I expected a better ride from the reviews I read about this shoe and its comfort. I broke it in on two six mile runs and then ran 13 miles on asphalt yesterday noticing that the sole shows signs of wear already. I would not buy another pair of these shoes, nor would I recommend them to anyone of my weight. Mildly disappointed.

B004LUS390|4.0|Its a great sketching app, however it would be so much better to mix colors with a blender brush of some sort.  I do a lot of digital painting, and  I use a blending brush ALOT, so I fell pretty restricted without having one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG !!! What can I say. It is simply an amazing read.<br />I started reading 50 Shades trilogy to compare the movie release (if its going to be released one day?). Reading some reviews about  the book earlier on, I had set my mind of not liking the book at all - but oh boy - it is a really good read.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Christian Grey. I am in love with him. The author, so vividly described the attraction and the chemistry between Ana and Christian, it was amazing. I am not a huge fan of the red room, but hey, lets face it, there are people out there  that are into such things. The author lets the reader feel Grey's point of having a red room and she does it so well that slowly as a reader, you accept the existence of the red room.<br /><br />Initially I didn't like the first book, as my reasoning was that it was all about sex. I mean where does it go from sex. The finger inserting, blah blah it is all there, kinky and all, but it doesn't make you squirm on your seat or anything like that.<br /><br />The second and the third books are simply GREAT. I finished both books in two nights. Hate to admit it, but I loved it. E L James, where were you ?
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Excellent playing, from the stars, really interesting story , language not easy to understand, why rhere are no subtitles in english or german
B006LSZECO|2.0|Where to begin. NYT review says ice pick sharp. I thought okay, that one's for me. Wrong. It took too long to build up and when it did it fell flat. There are so many more books out there better than one for 12.99 with a lot better ending.

B0014E9188|5.0|This entire presentation is superb and captures Porcupine Tree at their most overwhelming, but the latter half of the show is simply breathtaking. The progression of songs is phenomenal, from \\"Buying New Soul\\" through the triumphant \\"Trains\\" finale. You'll wish the band would release a dozen more DVDs.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|I think many reviewers were a little to generous with this film.  I give it three stars meaning it was adequate, a five out of ten.  Would I buy it, no, should you pay to watch it, no.  This movie has a few jumpy moments, but gets rather dull as the plot goes on.  The cinematography, as with so many films this days, is very professional and the setting is very dreary, reminding me much of Jane Eyre.  So, yes stylistically this film is cool and it was entertaining; however, the characters and the precarious plot ruined it for me.  The characters are rather dull, and flat, and I found it hard to attach myself to their emotions, or care about their fate.  The plot was also a letdown.  The ending seemed contrived, like the writers couldn't think of an ending so they followed the typical suit of love or death, and a lot was left unexplained.  So there you go, unfortunately a big budget doesn't seem to help screen writers pull their stories together nicely.
B002IKLNW4|3.0|If you'd find humorous the profound misery of someone driving across the country and intentionally avoiding the most interesting parts, and I do, then this book is a nice read. It reads incredibly quickly, as there isn't much information to digest. This is time-passing stuff....plane or bathroom reading, plenty monotonous enough to put you to sleep. But it's also more relevant than ever, and Bryson's acidic observations about the often terrible people that inhabit small town America seem quaint compared with what he might find there now, 20 years later.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I waited anxiously for this album. I was really excited for it but also worried. One of my biggest worries when any of my favorite artists come out with new music is that they will be more concerned with selling their music than making it good. I enjoyed all of their previous albums and so hoped this one would be as engaging and powerful. My Linkin Park exposure started with Minutes to Midnight and so I was never disappointed with their change in direction. I merely appreciated the many different styles they do so well. However, Burn It Down, their lead single, felt bland when I listened to it and I wasn't sure I'd like LIVING THINGS. But my first listen to LIVING THINGS relieved all my fears.<br />Linkin Park is just as committed to making good, unique music as ever and when put in the context of the album, Burn It Down is much stronger and I like it much better. LIVING THINGS blends the 'old' and 'new' Linkin Park flawlessly but also shows growth from the band. It's not a safe album full of recycled songs and material to keep (or bring back) fans but an album that could stand on it's own without Linkin Park's four previous albums. LIVING THINGS is a compelling and confident album that I can't stop listening to. It's not a perfect album (although only by a small bit) as LIVING THINGS felt at times short (I wanted there to be more when it was over!) and Chester Bennington seems to lose power towards the end (as Mike Shinoda sings and raps more on the second half of the album, it meant less of Chester).<br />My favorite songs off of the album were Until It Breaks, Skin to Bone, Roads Untraveled, and I'll Be Gone. However, there are only two songs that haven't gotten stuck in my head or I couldn't sing along to - In My Remains and Tinfoil - and as Tinfoil is instrumental, it's a testiment to the strength of LIVING THINGS. In conclusion, LIVING THINGS is a gift to true Linkin Park fans and delivers the best of Linkin Park's rapping, screaming, singing, writing, and playing.

B003L77TZI|5.0|She seemed a bit stiff and rehearsed but when you're as adorable as they are, no one really cares what she has to say.<br /><br />I'm Katy's biggest fan and I just love to see the three of them dance and sing and sometimes when she's looking in the camera, I feel like they are speaking directly to me.<br /><br />I live in rural Ohio and we raise our own rabbits out here. I think if Katy ever got to meet me we would become good friends. Maybe not get married, but she would like to hear my stories about how I was in the auxiliary fire department here even before I was 16 (Mr. Camp told me he'd never even heard of anyone that young in any surrounding county either) and then she could sing me a song about how in love with me she was.<br /><br />But I know that probably won't happen. No one can stop me from wishing it was so. Sometimes I cut pictures of her out of the magazine and I put it on my wall.

B006PTL1QM|5.0|A DANGEROUS METHOD is an exquisite film with brilliant acting, the historical mystery of the beginning of psychoanalysis,with Carl Jung, his first patient, Sabina Spielrein and Sigmund Freud, in the class with the film on the life of Mozart, Amadeus. The script is terrific, and mostly historically accurate, and is based on the London play, The Talking Cure,and the book A Most Dangerous Method, By John Kerr, the book I used to write a play I did off off B'way in '07, Jung Among The Women, which I turned into an Amazon.com novel.This film is 5 plus stars, and is miles above the boring and mediocre movies made in the US. Keira Knightley should get an Academy Award for her role as Spielrein, she is that good.The USA is probably the most neurotic nation on the globe, needs to look to this kind of elevation of the psyche, to what Jung calls in the film, \\"another hinge to the universe\\" - He disagreed with Freud, in that psychoanalysis should do more than describe the sexual \\"toad\\" of our illness, but show us the way to become the person we were meant to be i.e, individuation and the constellation of our archetypal SELF\\" For Canadian Jungian Analyst Miriam Woodman\\"All therapies without archetypal energy are merely bandaids.\\"<br /> Edward Nagel

0439023483|5.0|This book honoslty without a dought changed my life. This beautiful piece of art took me into Panem as Katness Everdeen, a strong powerful young women, whom goes I to the games for her sister.  She is put in the arena to fight to the death for the capital to prove there power. Through the journey she becomes character in a \\"Star-Crossed lover\\" act and ends up winning. Before I read this I was that too cool for school non-read and pritty much had the book jammed I front of my face. That worked for the first few sentinces and I could honostly not put it down.<br /><br />Again I never read so when I started reading at 1 pm and sat locked in my room until 3 am still reading, I was in love. I ended up having this piece of art torn away from me. I screamed in the reaping, jumped up and down at the roof-top screen, threw the book when Peerage joined the Careers, balled at Rue'S(no spoilers) big sceen....., and fryer again at the ending. Not a joke, I probably missed some too. I was so changed by this book that everyone knew me as the Hunger Games Girl. I had tears fall in class, convinced atleast 35 people to read the book(all ending up loving it), fundraised more books for the school, and became one of the biggest readers in my grade.<br /><br />*A message to the haters of fearful because of bad ratings*<br /><br />If you haven't noticed there are haters for everything great known to Earth?! Take a chance to smell the flowers but don't let your fear of bees stop you so to speak. Katness is not dull or boring, shes a great character and is one of the most exciting. This story. Ever stops with excitement. Its not a chick flick like twilight but its not a war story. If you are that fearful, please atleast barrow this from a friend or from the library. Haters will hate but the best wont take. Just putting it out there.<br /><br />Don't take the chance of not knowing what you don't understand<br />With love- Conscience

B007V4LKRU|3.0|It was nice to be able to purchase an ALBUM again, they always feel and look good to me, and I love the sound quality of vinyl.  I am an old Rush fan, not a fanatic but definitely a fan. Have seen the band live many times and own most of the records.  One of the elements of Rush that drew me in in the early years/albums was the dynamic with which the band played, which came across both live and on the records.  That for me is the one thing that is missing from this record, they have fallen prey to the current \\"loudness war\\" and squashed this thing to death. Don't get me wrong, I think the writing and performing is all still there, just that the sound has moved into the status quo for the time.  I wonder what this record would sound like had they used Terry Brown to produce it?    Addendum:    WOW! I never anticipated so much angry feedback from readers. Sorry people if my comments offended. But please, stop being abusive here, there just my comments/opinions, and like a**holes, we all have them.    Maybe I should have been more long winded in my comments but I prefer short comments/reviews.  I was just trying to say that it felt like a full, non-stop train of sound coming at me when I played the record, no air around the sound, which in my humble opinion is very important to music, \\"a rest is still a note\\" is what one of my old music teachers used to say to me.    The \\"loudness war\\", weather you believe it is myth or not will continue to be discussed and has always existed in music production, it has just become so obvious in the past few years, it is not a volume/decibel issue, it is a dynamics issue, caused by to much compressing and limiting within the mix of the tracks, I have seen it, heard it and done it when working on tracks.    2nd Addendum:  For the \\"loudness war\\" discussion listen to this presentation, [...]

Now I'm not gonna tell you what the story is about because really why would you read it if I tell you all about it??!! Anyway, this book is so well written that I am gonna be buying the next book and also Ms. Swank's other novels..<br />Ok so why did I like this so much... First it read like a movie..(huh??) You know when you sit down to watch a action packed thriller how there is no down time... that's this book.. It's ooh, aah and bang, wham and kablam!!! yep that right... fabo... Second the characters are well developed and you care about what happens to them... Which means you cry when bad things happen and you laugh at all the silly things.. *omg, kinda like life huh?*... Third is having that satisfied feeling when you reach the end... but still wanting to find out what the next chapter in Rose's life will be like... *sort of like when you're eating a bag of M&M's, how each one taste so good but you can't help but eat the next one!?*<br />So there is my review without giving anything away, no spoilers... yeah me... Oh, one major thing... You really need to buy this book, read it, recommend it to friends.. hell recommend it to strangers!!! Yep that is just how good this book is...<br />Toodles!!!<br />[[ASIN:B0058UXHHK Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes (Rose Gardner Mystery #1)]]
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This concert DVD/CD set is amazing.  I loved watching Adele interact with the audience and see the emotions that singing her songs in front of them caused, for both her and the people watching her.  Several times I got chills, and watching her sing \\"Someone Like You\\" made me cry with her.  The CD doesn't have the talking and introductions that she does during the concert, so when you're listening to it in the car, you can just rock out.  Highly recommend to anyone that enjoys her music, or a good concert in general.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|I have loved Legos since I was a child, and I was absolutely giddy to purchase and put together Darth Vader's super star destroyer. This thing is awesome. It's huge, it's well designed, and it's fun to assemble. I learned a lot about Lego architecture putting it together. My next purchase will be the Falcon. It must be done.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Jaws tells the story of a bunch of beachgoers, on Amity Island, who get attacked by a giant man-eating Great White shark. This causes the local police chief to round up a marine biologist and a professional shark hunter to go on the hunt for the thing. What happens during the course of that hunt is going to surprise you.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, Jaws was directed by Stephen Spielberg(as you all know) and, after viewing the movie, I believe it is one of Spielberg's biggest achievements in filmmaking. Even though, when you watch The Making of Jaws featurette, he expresses the fact that it was very difficult to make the picture. Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production(mostly dealing with the mechanical shark for the film), going over budget and past schedule. The movie itself was well-recieved by critics and fans alike. It was the highest grossing film of its' time, in 1975.  The film stars Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint(my favorite character out of the whole movie), Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. It spawned  three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley, with varying success. It's been imitated many, many times through the years in different movies about sharks but not with as much success as Jaws.<br /><br />Honestly, I've always been more interested in Spielberg's Science-Fiction movies(like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extraterrestrial, Jurassic Park, and War of the Worlds) but this movie has me looking up his older movies no matter what genre of movie to watch. Jaws is a great movie and one that should be viewed by everyone at some point. It truly is worthy of its' accolades.

B007B6VOG0|2.0|I have been listening to singer Nate Russ sing for some time now. His work with The Format is timeless example of indie pop. When I heard of Fun. I had to give them a listen. 'Aim and Ignite' was great to hear after knowing The Format was over. Seeing them live was also full of good memories. So when 'Some Nights' was on the verge of coming out I had expectations (they did not include a carbon copy album but did include a degree of creativity.<br /><br />'Some Nights' starts strong with a good intro/album title song that really show the strengths of the band but after that I find it hard to care about this album. I will admit there are songs on here that good but they are surrounded by the weakest songs fun. has written let alone Nate Russ or Jack from Steel Train. The hip-hop beats feel out of place on many songs and some are even leftovers from the last Kanye West album (worked with the same producer). The use of autotune may of been an artistic choice but it does not help Nate sound better as he was an awesome singer to begin with. This album is intelligent pop but does not have the emotion of 'Aim & Ignite.'<br /><br />\\"We Are Young\\" was a song I enjoyed at first release but it grew old after it became the anthem for every cell phone commercial and high school graduating class. It is not a bad song but it got overplayed. That is not the songs fault nor the band's so I don't fault them there. \\"Carry On\\" along with \\"Some Nights are the only songs on this album I would return to. I like the full album experience but I don't think I could tolerate the mediocre nature of this album's bulk to get to a few songs I kinda like. \\"Stars\\" would of been great but is ruined by Nate trying to sound like T-Pain on from an iphone app or something. I gave this album plenty of listens but never grew to like this album. I wish the band the best as they are talented members but I wonder if they will make unique and memorable albums again. This is an album that will turn this band from a beacon of indie pop to a one hit wonder. I do hope to see their creativity bleed through in the future and will definitely give them a chance.<br /><br />I am going to end this review with the names of Indie-pop artists that may interest those who also felt this level of letdown in this album but enjoyed their last record.<br /><br />'Jukebox The Ghost', 'Clap Your Hands And Say Yea', 'Queen Killing Kings','The Narrative, and 'The Front Bottoms'<br /><br />These bands are not guarantee to be something you would be interested but all have released an album in the same genre I would highly recommend buying before wasting your time with 'Some Nights'. 'Some Nights' would be worth the few songs it gives on mp3 download only as owning a hard copy would only provide the need to hit the skip button a lot. If a sale occurs then I encourage everyone to listen to this album in comparison to 'Aim and Ignite' and write their own review or comment on mine. I personally do not find it worth full price or space on my shelf. I have an itunes copy I had bought release and only put the few songs I like on my ipod.<br /><br />Music is subjective and this band is worth the attention they are getting but give it to them not just for 'We Are Young' and listen to their first album for sure. This is my opinion on 'Some Nights' which I am sadden to say is the biggest letdown of 2012. Hopefully the band can deliver in the future.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Anthony Ryan gets all the important things right.  He tells a coming of age story full of small gritty details while slowly revealing the larger world and his character's place in it.  It is masterfully told.  His created world is terrific and varied.  The characters are sharply drawn.  The book is fairly dark and won't be for everyone, but most fans of the genre will be more than satisfied.<br /><br />I'm pretty cynical and came across the book through a recommendation in a forum here on amazon.  I clicked on the reviews for the book and almost started rolling my eyes, but hey it was only $1.50 at the time so I bought it anyway.  The beginning few pages are absolute clunkers and I was ready to write it off, but the story really doesn't start until the second chapter.  When it does, it grabs you and just keeps getting better.  The only thing \\"indie\\" about this book is the price.

B00006WKSZ|5.0|Back in the early 80s, living in the UK, I was into bands like Rush, Rainbow, Sammy Hagar, Cheap Trick and the Scorpions amongst many others. The only Scorpions album I had back then was Tokyo Tapes that I had recorded off vinyl onto a trusty old C90 cassette. I loved that album....and then I got older, went to college, got a degree, got a job, got married, had 3 kids.....and generally matured somewhat. And then last week - at age 48 -  I decided to download Tokyo Tapes and take another listen. Man - I am so glad I did. I have a somewhat eclectic music taste. I have always liked rock music...not the really hard stuff but what I consider somewhat more sophisticated (I have always worshipped Rush!) but in recent years I have grown very fond of Rascal Flatts, Lady Antebellum and dare I admit I like a bit of John Mayer.......there, I said it !!!  Well, they are all great.....but I gotta tell you, Tokyo Tapes kicks butt. There are certain songs.....Speedy's Coming and Steamrock Fever are great examples...that will go with me to my grave. I read some of the reviews from people who give this album 1 star. I am sorry guys....you have either not listened to this album properly and given it the air time it deserves....or you picked up the wrong album in the first place. This album is a classic......it was a classic in 1978 when it came out, it is a classic today and it will be a classic in 100 years time. I had the pleasure of seeing the Scorpions in Bristol (UK) when I was at college. It was fun, they were very polished, very accomplished musicians and we all left highly entertained. They never took themselves too seriously - the gigs were always fun - and yet the music is just terrific. Bands come and go and a few of them leave a legacy which will last a long time....the Scorpions is one of those. if you have the time, listen to this album...not just once but ten times. make it the only CD in your car for a month....I promise you, you will thank me forever!
1401233066|3.0|Reason for Reading: Next in the series.<br /><br />This was a strange volume that felt like a cheesy outtake.  It settles the main story arc but in a rather tongue in cheek manner which didn't really seem to take the Dark Man story line seriously in the end.  First we start with a short episode involving Bufkin, Mirror and Frankie who are trapped inside the ruins of the office.  I enjoyed this short episode which is totally unrelated to the rest of the book but does either set up a new story arc or finish off one character.  We'll have to wait and see.  I found it quite ticklish to see that Eric Shanower had guested as the artist for this volume which ends up in Oz.  Then the main section of the book centres on the Super Team storyline which deals with several characters storylines and the overarching Dark Man story is concluded.  I just wasn't impressed with this turn of events and found everyone involved in it especially Pinocchio and Ozma incredibly irritating, I usually enjoy Pinocchio.  And the superhero theme incredibly fluffy and not very funny.  Finally, the volume ends with another non-related one story arc which brings a new character (or one who hasn't been seen for a long time, I can't remember) into play.  The volume leaves off with several new story arcs to follow and the title of the next volume, due out this summer, gives us a clue as to where the story will be going.

B006PTL1QM|5.0|A Dangerous Method doesn't delve as deeply into the rift between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud as it could have, but is nevertheless, a solid effort from director David Cronenberg. Cronenberg is not known for his subtlety, but the more mature style on display here is nuanced, and if it could have delved deeper, it at least gets what it does show right for the most part.  Though fans of his previous films might miss the shock and awe of films like Scanners, his remake of The Fly, Crash (not the Oscar winner but a much more twisted tale starring James Spader), Naked Lunch or Dead Ringers (the absolute worst date movie ever made), Cronenberg is at least consistent in that his films are always very challenging, psychologically speaking. He is King of All Head Games.<br /><br />Carl Jung: Sometimes you have to do something unforgivable... just to be able to go on living.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is Jung, and like the director, he could have gone deeper into Jung's more mystical, and some would say superstitious, theories, but presented more of a good doctor tempted by his attractive, but disturbed patient vibe. He wants to do the right thing, but how can you resist when you have Kiera Knightly throwing herself at you, and the Dangerous Method of therapy she begs for is the only thing that seems to provide her with relief?<br /><br />Sabina Spielrein: [to Jung] I want you to punish me.<br /><br />Kiera Knightly gives a very enthusiastic performance as Sabina Spielrein, but at first it almost went off the rails. Her character is Jung's patient, then Freud's patient, then she goes on to be a docter herself. She chewed the scenery a bit, but later, when she herself was a physician wanting to use what she had learned to cure other unfortunate souls, her performance was much better controlled and believable. She is also very easy on the eyes, and I get a sense that her career is on the verge of blowing up, big time. Same for Fassbender, who has nothing to be ashamed of, and was also in the much anticipated Prometheus.<br /><br />Also believable was Sarah Gadon as Jung's lovely wife, Emma, who not only provided him with a lovely family, but was also very rich, which gave the Jung doctor the luxury of pursuing his more esoteric objectives, such as Synchronicity, the Collective Subconscious, cultural and mythical archetypes, and the ancient wisdom unearthed in the I Ching, the Book of Changes. Another seminal character was Otto Gross, played by Vincent Cassel, who was a renegade doctor wanting to push the Dangerous Methods envelope even further, scoffing at the ethics forbidding patient doctor relations.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen, as Freud, was as usual brilliant. Though Siggy tried to pass himself off as above it all, he was just as much in thrall to his libido as the rest of us. The fact that he had repressed his desires didn't mean they weren't still exerting their influence. I think that he said things like \\"sometimes a cigar is just a cigar\\" in order to give him a little closet to hide inside. He wasn't fooling anyone, and his frustrated need to be some kind of surrogate father figure for Jung was as much of a reason for their rift as any. Furthermore, some of his theories were just wrong, and he could have benefited immensely from Jung's ideas.<br /><br />Sigmund Freud: Experiences like this, however painful, are necessary and inevitable; without them, how can we know life?<br /><br />The Bottom Line is that A Dangerous Method could have delved a little deeper, but the excellent cast and sure footed direction made for a most entertaining film--one that would make a much better date movie than Dead Ringers. There are a few steamy risqu&eacute; scenes, but most of it is left up to the imagination, and there are also some tantalizing glimpses of great ideas and psychological insights, but these are, alas, also left mostly to the imagination.was also in the much anticipated Prometheus.<br /><br />Also believable was Sarah Gadon as Jung's lovely wife, Emma, who not only provided him with a lovely family, but was also very rich, which gave the Jung doctor the luxury of pursuing his more esoteric objectives, such as Synchronicity, the Collective Subconscious, cultural and mythical archetypes, and the ancient wisdom unearthed in the I Ching, the Book of Changes.

B007B6VOG0|5.0|With the occasional operatic flourish, this album really sounds like Queen for the 21st century. The lead singer's pipes are just as powerful as Freddie Mercury's. I really appreciate their use of autotune, too. They use the autotuned voice as just another instrument, rather than using it to disguise or augment actual voices. I've been trying it persuade all my friends to buy this album!
B008BUK0XI|4.0|When the impressive sequel \\"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\\" got released on DVD, the version that got a wide release had that crummy Ultraviolent streaming extra feature and retailed for $19.99. As a Wal-Mart exclusive, Paramount also released an version without Ultraviolent stream extra with a retail price of $14.99. This version contains a yellow/goldish border around the front cover. That's the only difference. If you can live without the Ultraviolent extra and the ugly yellow border then this edition is well worth the discounted price.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a well written, easy to read book that truly kept me captivated.  However, I do believe Suzanne Collins or the publishers made a conscious decision to create 3 books with what should have been 1, or at the most, 2 books.  Hunger Games ended too early -- it was very anticlimatic for the heroine and the hero to survive the Games, then go home to a town in celebration .... but then the book ended prior to the reader enjoying the celebration .....
1612183956|4.0|I always have a mix of sorrow (for my strained budget) and joy (for a new discovery) when I try a book by an author I've never encountered and find that the writing, or subject, or plot devices, suit me to a T and now I'm forced to get other books by that author. That's what happened with \\"Pines\\". Blake Crouch has written a bunch of books and short stories, some in tandem with other authors, but I never encountered any of them before. I selected this from the Amazon Vine newsletter based on the blurb, about a Secret Service agent sent to locate two missing agents, and how he winds up in Wayward Pines, Idaho, which is apparently out of touch with the rest of the world. It's almost impossible to describe anything about the plot without giving it away, but I can state that it's an unusual take on a couple of popular sci-fi/fantasy themes. Unfortunately, there are a few serious flaws in the world creation of Mr. Crouch, but again, I can't describe them without revealing surprises best left to the reader to encounter. All I can really say is that I enjoyed this story tremendously and definitely want to read more of his books. The hero, Ethan Burke, is a level-headed guy with a loving wife and young son and a decent job in the Secret Service, after a military career that almost ended his life. Wayward Pines is a charming town filled with friendly people, but something isn't making sense. The more Ethan tries to figure things out, the more confused he gets, until the stunning climax. In this case, for Ethan, only seeing is believing. But once seen and believed, what will the future hold?

B007ZBWJXI|4.0|This album marks the 30th year of this super group since their 1982 debut. After their reformation with the original lineup, they released two albums, Phoenix in 2008 and Omega in 2010. Now, they're here with their third album, the aptly titled XXX.<br /><br />The songs are built on a strong foundation of melodic sensibility, perfected by Downes' keyboard and Howe's guitar work. The duo craft trademark Asia hooks and inject them into the compostions seamlessly. The lush, open sound production certainly enhances their delivery, leaving enough breathing room for John Wetton's vocals. Often times, his voice is treated with an overlay of reverb to give the songs deep space and resonance. The 'midnight mix' of the ballad \\"I Know How You Feel\\" cuts out most of the other instrumentation of the original version and puts the entire emphasis on Wetton's vocals, morphing it into a totally new song in a sense. Wetton's harmonies are sublime, too. \\"Bury Me in a Willow\\" is classic Asia, with its gripping 80s pop feel while the backing tracks of \\"No Religion\\" continue to loom over the arrangement as the rest of the band builds webs of melodies over sparse chord progressions. Steve Howe's guitar tone is to die for: clean and articulate. He adopts a wide range of techniques, from briefly blues-inflicted touches to funk-infested grooves and crystal-clear acoustic passages. Songs like \\"Reno\\" and \\"Ghost of a Chance\\" both feature acoustic solos which feel like songs within songs themselves. Carl Palmer proves he is one of the most unique drummers in all of rock. What some may consider questionable and uneventful is actually where this man's strengths lie. His deceptively simple yet powerfully accented beat constructs suggest he understands the need of the songs the best, impelling each piece forward with deftly nuanced cymbal and percussion work. Keyboards are as integral to this album as any previous disc. With richly textured symphonic pop hooks and melting piano lines, Downes is the key figure punctuating the melodies and bringing the tracks to their conclusion. Thanks to Mike Paxman's production work, there is even a blazing organ solo on the album that strangely connects the band to Uriah Heep.<br /><br />Fans of Asia must hear this album, even if they gave up on them back in 1992. This could be the album to reassure them that the band they once loved is still solid as a rock.key figure punctuating the melodies and bringing the tracks to their conclusion.

B007Y2W44W|4.0|Without naming all the overtly long song titles, At the Gate of Sethu sees Nile slightly toning down their complex, labyrinthine songwriting formula in favour of a more straightforward approach (by their own standards, of course). The tracks are filled with frenzied riff mastery; they are blindingly fast and carry a melodic weight to them. Densely churning riffs are interwoven into deranged, schizophrenic solos with haunting harmonies looming over the arrangements. The shorter pieces, thanks to the clever integration of authentic instruments and Egyptian themes, serve as interludes and help deepen the atmospheres intended to create. They are followed by intense, focused riffing and Kollias' seismic, hyperkinetic drum work which is given a larger space in the mix.<br /><br />The songs are marked with blasts of speed and thundering, brutal riffs, some of which are instantly gripping. The opening riff of \\"Natural Liberation of Fear through the Ritual Deception of Death\\" is glorious as is the melodically complex lead of \\"Supreme Humanism of Megalomania,\\" which is, unfortunately, the only track with an 'epic' guitar crescendo. While it is obvious Nile wanted to cut loose on this album, and they've done a great job at it, the album's finest moments are those when they choose to slow things down on the doom-like \\"Tribunal of the Dead,\\" arguably their heaviest offering here. It boasts 70s Sabbath-like riffs which are deftly hammered into shape by unsettlingly quiet passages and doomsday melodies. The mind-numbing, intricate guitar work is so sharp it could carve diamonds - this is what sets Nile apart from other death metal bands. Not only do they write obsessively focused and blistering riffs and solos, they also know how to incorporate them into the songs' most pivotal moments achieving cohesion rivaled by few others.<br /><br />While I consider this album another strong entry into Nile's never-disappointing discography, I still happen to like their period from Black Seeds of Vengeance through Annihilation of the Wicked the best. The low, guttural vocals, the more organic-sounding dynamically rich arrangements, and the cripplingly heavy riffs and lead passages on their Relapse albums have been missing on Nile's more recent output. The production on this one is similar to that of the previous two releases, but unlike Those Whom the Gods Detest, it seems like the low end could have been more emphasized, as there are moments when the whole mix is dominated by the relentless fury of the guitars and pummelling push of the drums. At times, this results in a claustrophobic soundscape, but given the album's flow and direction it works. The vocals consist of demonic grunts and bellowed, hellish screams that are punctuated by the more guttural, bowel-churning growls for added tension.<br /><br />The two instrumental bonus tracks demonstrate the band's knack for creating complex grooves and interlocking them with precise, stampeding rhythmic motion that might appeal to fans of Meshuggah. As a matter of fact, listening to each band's new disc back to back is a great experience.<br /><br />Finally, Seth Siro Anton's (Soilwork, Septic Flesh, Paradise Lost) is amazing. It definitely captures the dark side of Nile and reflects their current musical vision.s of Vengeance through Annihilation of the Wicked the best.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I love to watch movies for the pure entertainment and this series was very enjoyable.  I read all of the books and wanted to see if the series held up; well, it did.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was well worth the 3 days I put into it. In fact, I was so riveted by the storyline that I am well in the third book of this series. The language was simple but that is to be expected because it's a young adult novel. I really suggest it and think it has a large appeal.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This book is not at all like the movie that was released with Will Smith. It instantly pulls you in, alternating between the struggles Neville must face psychologically as well as physically it goes deeper into the Horror genre than just running scarred. He has to accept who he must become in order to live in this bleak new future. New plot elements are introduced in such a way as to keep you on the edge of your seat, hopeing and praying that Robert Neville will find the peace he needs to somehow be happy again. In the end, I was completely surprised by what happened.<br />This book is a whole new adventure from the movie and is far better in my opinion. It is not very long and very enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone who is even remotely a fan of psychological fiction, horror, zombies, vampires, post-apocalyptic future, etc..
B007L3BMGA|3.0|The title suggests something a little more left of center field or at the very least a meaningful helping of subtext that separates it from the mainstream. I guess straight forward panting and gasping sequences represents the shades of grey. Still compulsive, oddly enough, though I had to question my motivation for reading on. I read somewhere this was a poor woman's Jackie Collins. Poor women.

B007B6VOG0|5.0|Huh, didn't think it was possible for one act to combine Simon & Garfunkle, Elton John, Queen and Blink 182?  Well here ya go!  Talk about mixing it together in an original way.  I would never say they sound like any of these acts outright, but the influences of each can be spotted on different tracks.  I have to admit lyrically I enjoy Aim and Ignite a bit better, but that's probably just because I've had it longer.  This album is more anthem based and sing songy.  I will never forget when I was in a local pub and We Are Young came on and almost the entire band was singing along with the chorus.  That's a power you don't see often!  Good Job guys, can't wait til you come this way live.

I have tried to buy a couple of new puzzle packs, but keep getting an error message. I have sent 3 requests to customer service and still don't have an answer on anything, which is a shame since this game is exactly what I had been looking for. If you choose to use it, hopefully it works better for you.<br /><br />**It has been a while since my review, and everything is working much better!! Thanks for the hard work on fixing the bugs.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|Some are saying John can't top this one, and, when you hear it, you'll know why!<br />Although \\"Gravity\\" has always been my favorite, \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\", can bring me to tears. I had heard other artists do \\"Waiting On the World To Change\\", but, didn't realize Mayer wrote it. The lyrics are a reflection of what, I believe, a lot of us are feeling. John's guitar work on this album is superb, lyrics are so compelling, and when he sings them, his sincerity is genuine. John has a way of making his guitar reflect the feelings he has inside. His voice is captivating, and, can give me chills. If you want this 'live' you'll want to buy \\"where the light is\\". John Mayer is the real thing! I thank God, and, his parents, for giving us a man who really gets it!

B005LAII0S|3.0|I rented this movie because a friend told me it was worth seeing.  I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  The movie was good, but that is all - good.  Not a lot of amazing action, or dangerous moments to keep me in suspense.  I guessed most of the events before they even happened, including the ending before the movie was even half over.  It was an ok movie if you aren't expecting a lot of suspense, or if you don't mind the \\"dwarves\\" being short thieves with irritating \\"humor.\\"  Was ok to watch one time, but so glad I didn't waste my money watching it in the theater!  Not a movie I'll watch again.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is just terribly written. The writing quality is poor, the cliches, such as \\"pedal to the metal,\\" are frequent, the story is laughable, the characters are unbelievable with poorly developed histories, and the prose is repetitive. Just as bad, the plot is entirely unoriginal. I was paging through it and was thinking to myself, \\"hmm, this reads a lot like Twilight.\\" Lo and behold, when I looked on the internet to see if anyone else had found that connection I learned that 50 Shades had started off as a fanfic for Twilight before being \\"re-imagined\\" as an \\"original\\" story. The more I thought of it, the more similar it seemed.<br /><br />Mild Spoilers:<br /><br />Bella and Anastasia are practically interchangeable, Edward switched from the dangers of the fangs to the dangers of kink with Christian, they have the best friend Jose/Jacob who, despite being gorgeous and crazy about Bella/Anastasia, has never really managed to attain her interest, everyone lives in the Pacific Northwest. Ana is clumsy and shy, her mother is hapless and remarried again, she's close to her father figure who is a man of few words who likes sports. Christian is multi-talented (multilingual, plays the piano at basically a concert level, is loaded) and is flawlessly gorgeous. He's adopted. There was an incident with a near-car crash that made it impossible for him to stay away. He's creepily obsessed with her for no imaginable reason (it's a bit harder to explain when you take out the magical aspects) and is excessively over-protective. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Basically this is trash writing, a borrowed and watered-down plot, with unbelievable characters. I downloaded it to my kindle because it was a bestseller, and had no idea what I was getting into. Save your money and buy elsewhere.

I 100% agree with the person who said it seems like a teenage girl wrote this book.  Very disappointed, a waste of time.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Although poorly edited, I had to give E.L. James props for even getting a book, let alone three to market.  There are so many instances of where the same words were utilized throughout this book it was maddening! I often thought, \\"Does this author not own a thesaurus?\\"<br /><br />With regard to the story itself, it was your basic girl meets rich boy, blah, blah, blah, (don't want to give away the plot here), some rising action/tension, and interesting characters.  It's not a bad read, just not one that would be suggested in one of your lit classes.  Which brings me to why I would suggest it for FUN summer read:  a complete escape from reality with a bit of intrigue thrown in, something to really wriggle your toes into the sand with!  I say buy it, read it and above all, have fun.  DO NOT be discouraged and stop reading with Book One.
B005LAIGN2|2.0|These men braved enormous odds and overcame bigotry to serve. The movie Red Tails is a poor example of a movie telling a compelling story. The attention to effects, costumes, locations, and other technical aspects was very impressive.  Basic characterization and other important plot elements were severely lacking.  The actors tried their best, but simply could not overcome this anemic attempt at a movie.  I was sitting in the theater thinking \\"those great men deserved better than this.\\"

B003G88WTO|4.0|Let me be upfront, I am a late-comer to the Caribou party (more on that later), but better late than never, I suppose. This is Caribou's third album, released 2 years ago.<br /><br />\\"Swim\\" (9 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with the irresitable \\"Odessa\\" which will brings any wallflower to the dance floor. \\"Sun\\" follows, and as it starts off it immediately reminds me that this could be Radiohead, with Dan Snaith (the creative force behind Caribou) fading in and out as he sings \\"Sun\\" (there are no other lyrics). Intruiging tracks keep following one after another, such as \\"Kaili\\" and \\"Found Out\\". Another highlight is \\"Leave House\\", which reminded me of Hot Chip. The last best track is \\"Hannibal\\", another great dance-oriented tune. The album closes with 2 lesser tracks, the short instrumental \\"Lalibela\\" which reminded me of Cut Copy, and \\"Jamelia\\", the least memorable track on here.<br /><br />But for the last two tracks (reason I cannot rate this 5 stars), what an incredible album this is! Just fantastic! I saw these guys last month opening up for Radiohead here in Cincinnati, and they simply blew me away (and I picked up this album shortly afterwards, and have been playing it non-stop since). In their too short 30 min. set they played 5 tracks from this album (Leave House, Bowls, Jamelia, Odessa, Sun) that sounded even harder and better than on this album. Just amazing. I can't wait to see where this band is going next (they supposedely have a new album \\"Start Breaking My Heart\\" coming out soon). Meanwhile, \\"Swim\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

0307951529|4.0|Chris' book is very inspirational, which may be all that you need. The stories ring true, and they will encourage you to move forward on your startup.<br /><br />If you need technical details, you may want to find a secondary book to study alongside this one.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this game is a waist of time do not even try it worst time ever bcuz of the energy. worst ever
B0020GUXW2|5.0|What can I say?  I love this set.  I love the music.  It's perfect.  I listen to it almost every night.  Pablo Casals is amazing. It's hard to believe some of these recordings were made in the 1920s.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I'm just not understanding all the bagging being done on INDIANA JONES & THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL.  Look, I realize following 'The Last Crusade' is a tall order--even almost 20 years later.  And Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are definitely showing some mileage, but they still deliver their roles (especially Ford; no other sixtysomething actor could have pulled it off).  The one word I associate with the Indiana Jones franchise is Fun.  The first three were grand fun.  And so is this fourth installment, where this time, instead of the menacing Nazis, the villains are Soviet operatives, led by Comrade Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, sporting a coal black bob and heavy Russian accent, is priceless), racing Indiana into the Peruvian wilderness to find a treasure of gold that has extraterrestrial ramifications.<br /><br />And like all the predecessors, CRYSTALL SKULL is grand, seat squirming fun, from surviving an atomic blast to evading some nasty ants with serious attitudes.  And throughout, Ford is vintage Indiana Jones, escaping peril after peril with a smug quip at the ready.  With Indiana, humility is always right around the corner, and that's certainly the case with this fourth installment.  Other noteworthy roles are turned in by Ray Winstone and John Hurt; the weak link (as in all his films) is ghoulish Shia LaBeouf, playing young Mutt, a faux rebel who soon learns an extraordinary (yet not surprising) secret.  When LaBeouf makes his entrance riding a motorcycle and sporting a police cap ala Marlon Brando, I was doing some serious eye-rolling.  Yet even his inherent floundering takes little away from my enjoyment of this film.  INDIANA JONES & THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL may be far removed chronologically from the first three installments, but it more than holds its own being worthy to join this illustrious franchise.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B007FZ7R7W|4.0|I think this album is Chris brown's best yet.  Usually i have to skip over some songs to get to the good stuff but every track here is a gem.  I personally think that this is big step up from FAME.  For once he has come out with a complete solid piece of work.<br /><br />My favorite tracks<br />don't judge me<br />Till I die<br />mirage<br />4yrs old<br />biggest fan<br />tell somebody<br />2012<br /><br />and the ones that are not my favorite are only that because i haven't listened to the rest with a focused ear yet.  I have had these on repeat.<br />A lot of people are saying that he is still going down that path of cockiness and immature content but i think we all should try to separate his personal life from his music.  This is pure talent and i don't think you can deny it.<br /><br />Good job breezy
B00005JMYI|5.0|One of the most consistently hilarious and quotable movies I've seen, Anchorman is one of my all-time favorites. If you like Will Ferrell, you'll absolutely love this movie. If you have a good sense of humor, you'll love this movie. If you can laugh at scenes and characters that are are \\"so stupid, they're funny,\\" you'll love this movie. That being said, I did prefer the theater version to this uncut, unrated version. The jokes they edited out are funnier than the ones added to this version. However, the awesome special features and behind the scenes make up for it.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor is great fun for most of the family.  Great plot. Good acting with solid character development. Great directing. A good lesson for all of us (especially if you have siblings in your house) and awesome action. All in a movie that skips the needless bad language, bathroom humor, and cheap sex that fills all too many movies these days. And its all part of a great build-up for The Avengers.  Great job Marvel.  Keep them coming.
B0086700CM|5.0|I never knew what people were talking about. now I do. I'm ADDICTED to this game very much so!!! I absolutely love it! I play it a lot and get mad when I lose lil I even play it in the car tip I get sick!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Captain America is great fun for most of the family.  Great plot. Good acting with solid character development. A positive message and awesome action.

Great job Marvel.  Keep them coming.
B00723NWJE|2.0|We've been Norah fans from the beginning. Why? Her vocals are stellar.<br /><br />Her vocals are lost over the big sound of her new boy-band. Where did you go Norah? Please come back!<br /><br />We saw her live in Wallingford CT last night. The majority of the fans were 40-60+. The only big applauds were for her old material. The majority of the crowd walked out for the encore, us included.<br /><br />Sorry, Norah. We won't be back for another purchase or another show. The change is not for us.<br /><br />We miss the Handsome Band and your sultry vocals.

B0007XT87G|5.0|I can't write a proper review or we'd have a novel on our hands.  I'll simply say: this album changed my life and I will continue coming back to it for the rest of my days.  Granted, the same goes for just about every other Porcupine Tree album, as well as Steven Wilson's other work.  If you do not own this album, the time has come.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment. It's a copycat of Fifty Shades with no creativity at all. It looks like someone took a pen, marked up the Fifty Shades books with a few changes and published it under their name! It got so ridiculous I was rolling my eyes at times.........a waste of $15.<br /><br />Gideon, like Christian is a \\"gazillionaire\\" who owns companies bearing his surname. Both men live in penthouse apartments with private elevators. They are so drop dead gorgeous that women can't help but gawk at them wherever they go. They're both damaged and flawed inside with parents who died tragically when they were young; both men are haunted by nightmares. Neither have ever been in love, had \\"real\\" relationships or had a woman sleep overnight in their beds until they met Anastasia and Eva. They both have women who are deeply in love with them come into the picture. They both have bodyguards/chauffeurs who drive black SUVs. Each man has one brother and one sister and they're aloof towards their mothers. They're both obsessive, possessive and say \\"MINE!\\" to their women. Both men are the same age and reveal they're DOMS!<br /><br />Anastasia and Eva are very much alike as well. They both \\"fell\\" the first time they met their men. Both women live in apartments with roommates and have entry level jobs. They're both annoyed by the way their men invade their privacy and find out personal information about them. They are also both quite surprised when the restaurants/clubs/businesses they visit are owned by their men. They both have mind blowing sex with their men who can keep going like the Energizer bunny, but the women's appetites are insatiable. Both women's mothers are married multiple times and their men buy them gorgeous evening gowns and lingerie.<br /><br />Christian has grey eyes and Anastasia blue. Gideon has blue eyes and Eva grey. REALLY, where is the imagination of this writer?!?!? Why not come up with your own story?  I could keep going, but I think you getthe picture.
B008B3H4VQ|2.0|I'm making an effort to be generous to this album (and its creators and fans). I should first concede that my musical tastes have graduated many a time since my high school days, when Hybrid Theory came along (in all its timely glory) to claim a lucrative, pinnacle seat atop a sub-genre that was already enjoying a fleeting climax, or honeymoon, if you prefer.  Bear with me here--this leads to Living Things, I promise. Linkin Park has always capitalized on the lowest common denominator, though that's not to say they haven't had true moments of brilliance. In many ways, it's a shame that Linkin Park catapulted into the limelight in the precarious way they did; not because they didn't deserve the attention, but because their name was immediately synonymous with a sub-genre, which came pre-loaded with an audience, acute expectations, and (as with all sub-genres) a death sentence. Artists whose work defines a (sub) genre for the fickle ears of the masses, seldom are able to do so again (i.e., beyond their original niche in the genre). What I'm getting at is that the best artist deals directly with Beauty, not with a specific vantage point on Beauty (the 'vantage point' being, in simple terms, the genre or sub-genre). For several albums, Linkin Park was locked in that same 'vantage point,' the same 'style' if you will, and IMO there are two main reasons this happens with so many bands: 1) It's all they know or care to do. Or, 2) They're letting their audience dictate their music. The larger the audience, the more oppressive the 'dictator.'  NOW, this all goes toward saying: holy sh*t did you notice what Linkin Park did with A Thousand Suns?! They reached their collective hand OUT of that box, albeit a slightly wavering hand, nevertheless, they did it! And of course, what happened is exactly what we (in the business of treating music as art) would expect: by far the lowest selling Linkin Park work to date and resounding admonishment from slews of idiot \\"fans\\" who can onlypraise what they'd expect, what's familiar, what's easy.  I was really hoping that Linkin Park would turn their backs on the stupid throng, in the name of something fresh and unexpected, in pursuit of that promise with which A Thousand Suns is ripe, in the name of art, by God! But no.  Living Things is an assured step BACK, a semi-stale platter of a dozen processed morsels catered to the Audience, punched out in tight 3-minute intervals in true assembly line fashion. Yes, in 2010 they reached their hands out of their fateful little box, only to have it slapped back by Mr. Audience, who stubbornly wants to consume, relive, and toss to the wayside--music as product.  Granted, this album's not ALL that bad. It's certainly worth $5, and it's probably worth 3 stars, but I hope that one day these guys will be able to say screw the audience and play from their bleeding hearts. I assure you, there are certainly nice little instances of brilliance on Living Things, but more often than this, I find myself sighing and at the very same moment think I detect a new, highly pitiable pain in Chester's voice.  It's a pain that says he's walking back and forth over bridges he could swear he remembers burning.
0345803485|1.0|Ok, so are you kidding me right now??? THIS is what people have been clamoring about?? (Rolling my eyes)  This book was a complete joke. Personally I didn't think much of it. I felt there was a lot (and I do mean a LOT!) of redundancy. If I read \\"his lips pressed in a hard line\\" or \\"inner goddess\\" ONE more time--and did she really have to \\"bite her lip\\" at least five times in every chapter?, it was beyond annoying, I swear I was going to throw my kindle. Then on to the sex....let's just say if women were blown away with the sex scenes in the book, they must have some REALLY boring sex lives because honestly, who hasn't tried some of that stuff with their man--even if it was a scaled down version? Someone kept telling me, \\"Wait until you get to the bathroom scene!\\" so I thought 'Oh this is going to be good!' and I got to it and I was like, \\"That's it??? Phffft! Been there done that!\\" What a let down this book was. I just didn't understand the hype at all. Very disappointing.
B003B02O14|5.0|Loved the surprise ending - didn't see that one coming! Also loved how he worked from the ending backwards, another nice change of pace!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. So easy to use. Best Bible app I've found. Love being able to scroll up and down and so easy to go from one book-chapter- and verse to another. I would highly recommend this app.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I am starting to pick up recreational reading again and this was one of my first books.  I enjoyed the story, felt compelled to keep reading and overall had a good time.  I did not put any \\"could this really happen\\" studies on this book as much as I read the book because I liked the characters and want to know more.
B004499LWQ|2.0|ordered this movie on blu ray new and when i got it the disc was new but the case had been warped from heat damage and looked obviously recycled. kinda a big deal considering it was advertised as new. i wouldn't recommend this seller. if your going to reuse a case or disc then you better have the decency to give me one in great condition and not warped and wrinkled. i would not recommend this seller nor use them again. i was excited to get this and was disappointed at the results. what a bummer.
B0086DBE62|5.0|I am a fan of originals; especially original movies. It is my opinion that in the remaking/retelling of a story, the original luster and charm that captivated us to begin with is lost in that quantum leap. However, Julia Roberts and Lily Collins shined in this wit-filled, slightly off kilter film. There are many remarks spoken under breath, some that made me laugh out loud; and let me tell you, that is no small feat. I thoroughly enjoyed this classic tale, shaken with a twist.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is so much fun. olive this game because it gets me excited when you have to get ready to slice some fruit!  I just wanted to say I love the fruit ninja app!  for those that don't like it I have 2 say what the heck is wrong with u?
B0073XORCY|5.0|I have been a Tull fan since the mid 1980's.  I have many Tull and Anderson albums... some vinyl, some CD.  I am truly loving this CD!  To me, the styling sounds like it came out in the early 1970's, but with the polish and digital crispness of a modern recording.<br /><br />Some tracks are more \\"modern\\" than others... it's really a melting pot of Tull styles.  Interesting lyrics, narration and melodies are reminiscent to those found in the original Thick As a Brick, Rock Island, Songs From the Wood and such.  There's even a track or two that could have come from Crest of a Knaive.<br /><br />Although not technically a Tull album, it might as well be.  To me, this album is much more Tull than Anderson's solo works (Rupi's Dance, Divinities or Walk Into Light.)  The musical talent is top notch.<br /><br />I recommend this CD to any true Tull/Anderson fans.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I watched the 1st season after hearing from my coworkers how good this show is, now i have all 4 seasons and waiting for the 5th season to come out on dvd. I highly recommend this show as it will be a classic and hopefully last a long time.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's a testiment to the brilliance of this game that it can be so popular. After all, there is absolutely no chance of winning. Temple Run is to video games as Waiting for Godmother is to theater - a period of crushing failure played for fun. Marvel at it. You cannot win. You never reach the prop plane waiting for you. You will die again and again. And yet you must run.
0061726834|2.0|After having read \\"Before I Fall\\" ONLY because I wanted to read Lauren Oliver's first book published before I read her second one, I was utterly disappointed. As a conspiracy theorist, I have great appreciation for books about dystopian societies and totalitarian governments; however, this book just seemed to be an exhausted combination of \\"Uglies\\" by Scott Westerfield and, well, any other book about a totalitarian government. With a rather predictable plot that drags along, one cannot help to think that Oliver is SO much better than this. Since I do love Oliver's first novel \\"Before I Fall\\", I really truly wanted to like this series so I read the second book, \\"Pandemonium.\\" Where this book bored me with an exhausted plot, \\"Pandemonium\\" surprised me and had excitment at almost every turn. I am currently conducting an experiment on one of my friends by making her read \\"Pandemonium\\" without reading \\"Delirium\\". While she was slightly confused at first, I feel as though the second book does eventually cover everything you need to know. Bottom line: SAVE YOUR MONEY! READ \\"PANDEMONIUM\\" NOT \\"DELIRIUM\\". Oh, and while you're at it, read \\"Before I Fall\\". Trust me, you'll love it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This CD is fantastic. The music, the concept, all great. I don't know how they do it. Can't wait to see this tour.
0345803507|3.0|If you are looking for a great literary classic this in not the book to read. If you are looking for a juicy novel to distract you for the day then dive into Fifty Shades of Gray. The first two books are not bad,but her writing and story line starts to fall apart in book 3.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is perfect, there's a challenge in it but its not a little challenge, its a [[ASIN:B004T2QZL8 Doodle God]]big and hard one. This product is one of the best ive ever played, but I think you should make more products.
B005D63LL6|5.0|Dexter Delivers, again and again. This season was a non-stop roller coaster ride, thanks to great writing and acting as always!! I have seen and own all seasons to date and still I have never been disapointed. That's all I have to say on this as I don't want to give up any of the story line.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm so looking forward to book #2.  Great read and very vivid!  Of course I would love to meet this Christian Grey guy...Just meet.  It's quite an interesting read considering it's written from a female perspective.  It really breaks you out of your shell- if you have one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love it. it is very entertaining and quite addictive actually. its also pretty mindless so its a good way to tune out at the end of a really long day at work or school.
0525478817|5.0|-SPOILER FREE-<br /><br />If you buy this book, you will not regret it - it had me hooked right from the first paragraph, and did not let up, not even once it ended. It made me laugh out loud, it made me cry freely, and the completely unexpected ending left me breathless. I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 13 who loves to read.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This show rocks. The dvd's were in great shape, although I can't seem to get the commentary's to play, but that may be my system not the dvd.
0060574216|4.0|I ran across this book in my mid-20s while in an office waiting area and I did not want to put the book down; after my appointment I went directly to the bookstore and bought it. There were so many things in the book that I could relate too! It made a lot of sense to me. Many years later I still think this is a great book about relationships, and have recommended it to those in a rocky relationship, or even no relationship at all.  The \\"rubber band\\" analogy and the \\"man going to his cave\\" explanation was an eye opener for me!  Some may call it cliché or stereotypical, but there is some truth here in this book. Truly, this book opened my eyes to male/female relationships.  I think it helped me with my dating and relationships back then when I first read it, and was a great resource filed away in my brain that has helped me in the loving marriage I have now. Is it perfect?  Probably not, but it is very informative and an easy read.
B001BPJJ9G|2.0|The movie looks outstanding but that is not enough to sit through the movie when the story is awful.  There is a reason it did not make much money: the story is missing.

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is extremely addictive, challenging and can easily have you getting lost in hours of gaming instead of doing work that is priority. :)
B007MG360G|5.0|This is a great game and I reccomend it highly. I also love Doodle God and Doodle devil a lot.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game get it and play it. fun and tricky games. play over and over again.  never gets boring anytime
0439023513|5.0|If you want a great book to read in your down time this is it. The book MockingJay is kind of slow but when you get into it you wont want to put it down. It tells you what final adventure Katniss will face have to face against the capital. This book wont get your heart racing like the others but it will make you want more of the action and adventure of the Hunger Games. If you like Fighting and Adventure or if you dont this is the book you should read.
B007YA5NRO|5.0|I'm really impressed with my Fuji X10, even more so since I downloaded this book. The user manual that comes with the camera is a comprehensive guide to the switches, buttons and software options, however, explanation of how/when to use the powerful capabilities is missing.  The book explains everything, is easy to follow and opens doors to capabilities that don't even rate a mention in the Fuji manual.  If you have this camera and enjoy using your camera's full power, buy the book.
0894803123|5.0|Book is great. Full of awesome dessert ideas. The colorful graphics add a nice aesthetic to the already cool book also.<br /><br />Purchased this book from http://www.amazon.com/shops/Starks_Cat_Rescue. Great book in great condition. Buy your books from a trusted source, and help some cats at the same time. ;)
B0086700CM|5.0|the game is awesome in my eyes I don't know about you but it is one of my favorite games
B006H8BIIM|2.0|the game is fun and graphics are great.  I upgraded to a fully functional station for 99 cents and had a blast.  but next time I played it reset to before I upgraded and I can't get it to upgrade like I payed for.  I am very upset.  VERY VERY VERY UPSET!!!!!!!!!
B0052VUNHC|3.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS. A first read for me by this author. This story features Abby Abernathy and Travis Maddox, and host of their friends at university.<br />Abby and her best friend America, attend Eastern university, Abby wanted to attend here to be as far away from home as possible. As supportive as ever America went with her best friend. America had met Shepley at student orientation, love at first sight for them. So tonight they are all at an underground fight to watch Shepley's cousin, Travis Maddox fight. This is where Abby first meets the large muscular tattooed Travis.<br />Travis is very popular with the female students who follow him around like a pack of adoring puppy dogs. Hanging on his every word. Abby has no intention of joining in with that. Abby's lack of interest in him, is what sparks Travis's interest in Abby.<br /><br />This is possibly one of those books you will either love or hate. My own feelings are that this is extremely well written, and for me it is about a romance between two people who IMO deserve one another. The two leads start out by becoming friends, although it is obvious to the reader that Travis wants more. After a silly bet between him and Abby, which she loses. Abby has agreed to stay at Travis's flat, for a month. He shares the flat with Shepley, who by the way is his cousin. Abby absolutely refuses to sleep on their sofa as this is where Travis has sex with the many girls he brings back. He never allows them in his bedroom. So Abby and Travis agree to sleep together in his bed in his room. As I said earlier, Travis wants more from Abby, but she isn't going there, as to her Travis is a serial womaniser. So when Travis overhears a conversation between Abby and America, that really ticks him off. He gets drunk and brings home not one but two girls, and proceeds to have sex with them on said sofa. Knowing that Abby can hear everything, as she is in the next room. After which he throws them out and comes and gets in bed with Abby. Okay so at this point they are not an item, but they were friends, and he knew that Abby would hear everything so at the very least that was disrespectful IMO. But that was Travis a total idiot he constantly messes up. When Abby did not go back to the dorm after that, I lost quite a bit of respect for her. It was this incident, along with some others. That set the tone of this story, and for me it was difficult to care about either of the two leads.<br />Abby was not entirely without blame herself, as she had recently started to date a guy called Parker (who by the way seemed a much nicer guy than Travis). Abby expected poor Parker to accept that at the end of their dates she was going back to Travis and Shepley's flat to sleep in the same bed as Travis, all very platonic she assures him!<br /><br />My overall take on this was that Abby and Travis really deserved one another, which at least would mean they that didn't inflict themselves on other people. Abby was escaping from what she thought of as her less than savoury past with her Father. At times she came accross as a hard drinking card sharp. While Travis was portrayed as an out of control and violent young man.<br />To sum up this book contained many instances of very violent behaviour, gambling and lots of drunken parties. I also wasn't totally convinced of Travis's love for Abby, it was written as more of an unhealthy obsession. Which rather described their relationship for me. All in all a book that was a real page turner, even if I did not feel comfortable with some of its content.Okay so at this point they are not an item, but they were friends, and he knew that Abby would hear everything so at the very least that was disrespectful IMO.

B0071F1WXQ|5.0|Recently purchased this record. First time buying a record and I have to say that I'm in love! Perfect condition, audio is delightful. The only thing I was sad about was that the item could not be shipped to Puerto Rico, so I had it sent to my aunt for her to send it to me.  Overall, the product was exactly as pictured.  Playing it right now, in fact! It was certainly a great find!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I could NOT put this book down. The entire thing just kept me interested. This book is a definite must read! I wasn't sure about the book in the beginning, because it sounded like it was going to be predictable... I was 100% wrong. love this book! Wish I could forget I read it, so I could read it all over again!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Read this book in two days.  I was hooked after the first few pages, I simply could Not put it down.  Best Read I've had in ages and i still haven't found one yet that comes close to competing with 50 Shades; and i've been looking!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have become addicted to this game. Its been so much better since the last updates. I wish there were more mini games though. The kung fu scratch game could be better in the rewards part. I like it that you can win something no matter what just wish there were more ways to win more acorns. I also would like to expand my village to include the water area. would like to catch scratch in other villages more than once a day. At any rate I look forward to more fun and any upgrades.
B000AQBAUI|4.0|Good hard rock band with lots of guitar riffs and solos.  As others have posted they sound like Led Zep and Free; and if you like those two (and what hard rocker doesn't) you should like Leaf Hound.  \\"Work My Body\\" plays for over eight minutes with riffs and strained vocals of Peter French, who sounds a bit too much like Robert Plante.  Liner notes details the history of the band, includes song lyrics.  A good buy.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. I am about half way through and it has only just now prompted me to review it, which I find quite fair. It has been challenging without being frustrating in my opinion. The hints are very helpful when you need them and the main character is good.

1401300529|3.0|As an avid reader of World War II history, I decided to finally read something on the Korean War, about which I knew little to nothing.  I expected a book about the war - kind of along the lines of Stephen Ambrose - but instead found it to be a book more about politics than the war.  As a Political Science major, this wasn't a very big deal, but it was still not what I was hoping for.  I did learn a lot about the war and particularly the politics of the day.  The book, however, could have been much shorter.  Contained within it are mini-biographies on MacArthur, Mao, Truman, and many of the other generals and major players - which is interesting, but again, not what I was expecting.<br /><br />In addition, and other reviewers have mentioned it, the author is definitely politically partisan.  He obviously has his own slant and much of the book read more like an opinion piece than a historical work.  He makes many judgment calls and even manages to bring in George W Bush and the author's opinion of Bush's handling of Iraq etc.<br /><br />All in all, it is, if nothing else, VERY thorough.  I would have liked far less opinion, far more accounts of the actual war and the battles as well as accounts from the soldiers (from reading this book, there were really only two or three battles in this war - Pusan, Chosin, and Chipyongni/Tunnels).  I came away with a much better understanding of the big picture of the war and the political environment of the time than I entered with.<br /><br />For anyone interested in history, it is essential that we know about the Korean War and this time in our nation's and the world's history.  It was the next chapter after WW2 and it preceded Vietnam and set the stage for much of our politics of even today.  I can't say I would recommend this book (if I did, it would be with great caution in terms of the author's opinions and slant) but I would recommend very much gaining an understanding of this war and this era.
1933633867|5.0|This is a lively anthropological and philosophical romp through the history of Debt.  Including substantiated critiques of current economic theory. This work will be a classic in it's field, which questions the root of the belief:  One MUST pay ones debts.  Read this today.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Yes, the amazing voice of Carl Wilson and the energy of Dennis Wilson are absent.  No, Brian can't hit the falsetto anymore.  Yes, they were all pushing 70 at the time they recorded this.  So, no, it is NOT the Beach Boys you may know and love - especially if all you know is the hits from the early 60s.  Like most bands/artists who evolve and mature their music as they do themselves, the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson do, too.  Yes, it does have a bit of a dated, 80s sound.  But for me, a 42 year old who has loved the Beach Boys since I was in single digits, it's great to hear the Boys back at it again.  The lyrics are, for the most part, fitting.  The tunes are fairly catchy (my 9yo girl loves the title track and Spring Vacation, for example).  The production quality is good.  And their voices are still in good shape - far better than many other artists of their age or even younger.  Al and Bruce are probably the strongest, followed by Brian, whose voice had a heavy toll taken on it by his drug use back in the day, and last by Mike Love, who remains one of the more distinctive voices.  Taken for what it is - perhaps the \\"last hoorah\\" of one of the greatest acts in American music history, this is a solid CD.  If you're a Beach Boys fan who knows songs that weren't on the Greatest Hits CDs or had their cassettes/albums in the 70s and 80s, then you'll at least \\"like\\" it.  But if all you know is Surfin' USA and Barbara Ann and such, then you probably will not like it.  Keep it in perspective.  If you do - it's a solid CD and a great listen.
B001GU04MW|5.0|Es un autentico placer poder disfrutar esta fantástica grabación que contiene una excelente selección de temas con una impecable toma de sonido. Destacar temas como el \\"Samba pa ti\\" o el \\"Black Magic Woman\\". No debería faltar en ninguna discoteca. IMPRESCINDIBLE

Not to mention all of the classic's they play from there past! I'm sure everyone will have a new favorite somewhere here on XXX as it redefines the band's sound!
1451629184|5.0|This book was recommended to me by several friends. I love memoirs! I saw it in a local book store for $25, but with shipping included, I got it on Amazon for only $13! I would highly tecommend this to anyone who enjoys reading true stories.
0345803485|2.0|\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is about as far as I can get from the types of books I usually read. In fact, I read it mostly on a dare - which only left me more surprised to have enjoyed the book and to have been really affected by it.<br /><br />Most of the criticisms I've read of the book are perfectly valid. The writing is often horrible. If you took a swallow of Champagne (the main characters' drink of choice) every time a mouth was set in \\"a thin hard line,\\" you'd quickly be drunk. The young American characters speak English that sounds a little too British. And I was amazed that the author could write all the sex scenes without once using a colloquialism for anybody's genitals. Apparently S&M is naughty, but not dirty.<br /><br />Despite those flaws, at least two dimensions of the book were enjoyable and even thought provoking. First, many of the sex scenes were pretty hot, albeit - as Christian Grey says - in a \\"vanilla\\" way. For whatever reason (writerly skill? readerly inhibitions?), the S&M scenes scenes were not very arousing - or very transgressive, especially given the heavy emphasis on Christian Grey's deviance and depravity. (A better writer would have shown this to her readers, rather than simply told it to us again and again.) That point notwithstanding, the sex did advance the plot by showing, in a way that's probably familiar to most people who have been in a relationship, how lust really does create bonds between people. Not necessarily the best bonds, but bonds nonetheless.<br /><br />The second dimension of the book that I liked was its (again, often clumsy) examination of how couples negotiate couplehood. Sex is part of that process (the major part of it, in this book), but so is the push and pull of openness and secrecy, which is at the core of the book. Anastasia wants to know more about Christian than he wants to tell. He wants her to be open to his predilections, but she's reluctant. Isn't that dynamic common to all relationships, no matter how loving and non-sadomasochistic? While I often rolled my eyes at how the author tried to illustrate (or even just describe) this part of the evolving relationship between the two, their struggles rang true.

B005LAJ16I|2.0|This was a show I was really excited about watching and one that had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it never really lived up to that potential. There was some good acting, particularly by Mandy Patinkin, playing the mentor of Claire Dames' CIA officer. Any scene he was in was fun to watch, the way he interacted with the other characters. Damian Lewis also did a good job, but the underlying motivations for his character were far too shallow to explain his actions.<br /><br />I would say that the first two thirds of this show were solid four-star material, but regrettably things started going downhill and finally fell apart all together in the final three episodes as the heroine came apart at the seams(an effect that was more annoying than dramatic) and the producers took the easy way out. The final moments of the show hint at a Season 2, but I won't be in any rush to watch it.

B000HKYA1I|2.0|The movie is classic but unfortunately the DVD is not as good.  We had numerous problems with the DVD because it would not play properly.  It froze twice and had poor visual display three times.  This is the only DVD that we have ever had problems playing.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|This is a good album but with some flaws Avenged Sevenfold is a pretty good band with good songs like batcountry,Seize the day, City of Evil,and Many others then there are some bad songs and when I say bad I mean they suck I would recommend this album and There selftitled and any thing before 2009 Any thing afterwards just sucks to Me Maybe not you But to me yes.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|enjoy this game. great at night and when I am sitting waiting for whatever reason. think expanding is kind of unreasonable though.
B000XPCGSG|5.0|Wow this is a very good albulm this is Anthraxs best ever albulm Anthrax has a lot of other good albulms but this is there best hands down. My favorite song off this is Indians I love how it changes speeds and the instruments sound so good. I love todays Metal but the Big four are the best Metal bands in history and I like all of them I would recomend this if you like Modern Metal like dragonforce or any other modern speed or thrash Metal bands to see where they emerged from 80's Thrash/speed/Heavy Metal is the best Metal there is Hands down.
B000R34V50|4.0|It was fun but I only watched it once. Maybe my nephew will enjoy it more. They did a good job with the graphics but I've seen it all before.
B00004Z459|5.0|Ok I'm not a huge fan of linkin park I like about 16 of their songs and this is their best albulm.  The best song on this albulm is In the end it is a really good song I would reccomend this to people who like nu-metal or Classic Linkin Park.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made I heard Peace sells a long time a go and said this a a very good band. Then I heard Holy wars the punishment due and said this is a very good song. So I went out and bought this albulm listened to it without skipping any of the songs This is Megadeths best albulm. Also Check out peace sells but whos buying it is a very good albulm.

0345529057|5.0|Decent price, perfect condition, and I couldn't ask for more. Some people care that this has pictures from the HBO series on the covers, but that doesn't matter to me.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Ok Slipknot is one of my favorite bands every song on this albulm except 2 are good(prelude 3.0,Danger keep away). I have noticed that slipknot is trying not to cuss as much and use more radiofriendly songs but they unlike many other can actually pull this off and still keep me Loving their stuff I would recommend this to any body who likes Nu/Heavy-Metal.
0307592731|2.0|I'm going to keep my review short since most of the reviews already posted cover what I want to say. Her mom dies and her mom just keeps dying. I'm pretty sure over 50% of the book is her talking about her mom's death. We get it. You were relatively young and your mom died. Last I checked, people die all over the world all the time with tons of orphans, I fail to empathize to the level the author expects. Instead she goes on the PCT with raging hormones wanting to sleep with practically every guy she meets. This is nothing but a look at me I threw a pity party for myself and ended up sleeping with a few guys out in the wild. As with other reviewers, if I knew this is an Oprah book club pick, I wouldn't have bothered.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This Album is so freaking good it is a true metal albulm by a true metal band If you like dark lyrics and hardcore gutair solos I would recomend this to you for sure this is real music people.
B001EBV0NU|1.0|This is a complaint bout the situation with amazon instant video, this movie was a great sci fi dark comedy and it used to be available for free to prime members so why not anymore? I would like to know what happened if you know please leave a comment and if amazon is reading this then send me a message what happened.
B0071WQ7WU|3.0|This albulm has a few good songs some ok songs and then some very sucky songs. Bully is the best song on this albulm I would recomend bying Leave a whisper or Sound of Madness if you want a good shine down albulm.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|This is a good and funny movie-although I didnt see it that way at first but thats a different story-about a family who live in in a bomb shelter for thirty years and the girl the son meets when he goes up to get food supplies on earth. Its very funny in case I havent already said that and you should get it. I did once I changed my mind about it because I didnt want to see it at first. But like I said thats a different story. Which if you really want to know I got got dragged to The Truman Show by my parents-especially my mom- which at least in my opion is one of the dumbest movies ever so I wasnt about to fall for it twice and finally got my way and stayed home. They came home Singing praises about it. It was only when mom rented it that I saw it and changed my mind. I later bought it and you should too in case I* havent already mentioned it.
0547424779|5.0|Why read: Considered by many to be a classic.<br /><br />What impressed me: The Giver totally lived up to the hype, and from reading it I can see why everyone compares the newest YA dystopian books to it. The world created in The Giver is clearly the basis of many modern day stories. Knowing The Giver came first makes this short but powerful novel even more impressive.<br /><br />What disappointed me: I wish I had chosen to read this back in school, as I remember it being suggested reading may times over the years, but look at that cover. It's no wonder I never picked it up as a student.<br /><br />Recommended: Definitely. The Giver is classic dystopian for a reason.<br /><br />Continue series: Of course.
B00005JLWN|4.0|so far off. The action sequences are, of course, over the top, but there is a certain psychological plausibility surrounding the story line.
0780020685|5.0|I got exactly what was described. The disc was a little scratched up as are most used DVDs but I had no problem while watching it. Came a lot faster then was expected so that was also a plus.I jst wish it came in a actual box instead of a cardboard sliver.
0307474712|4.0|A really wonderful bit of fun fiction, although it has moments a serious contemplation it is largely built around a great concept and the fun jaunt it allows through twenty years of a couple lives.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is so fun and kinda addicting. It is great far ALL ages. Personally, I think it is a wonderful app to have on my kindle fire. Thx a lot. :-)
B000AJIF4E|3.0|i heard that these were very good and since it was a good price i got them for my first feature film, to use with the azden boom mic.  the sound guy kept losing sound in one ear and would have to walk up to the camera input to jiggle the plug.  sometimes it came back, sometimes it didn't.  it's very sensitive, though, as he would warn me that a truck was coming down the road, 2 minutes before it got there.  they absolutely will warn you of unwanted sound, for sure, i just don't know why we ended up with one working \\"ear\\".
B007KOYEOC|5.0|This book was totally addictive. I read it in 3 days. I could not put it down. I would recommend everyone read this. A fantastic book.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|A great anthology of many of his greatest his. The problem is you have to buy several CDs to get all his hits. Tupelo Honey is missing from this one.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy playing this app because of the ability to do various sized puzzles.  The fact that you don't need to store the puzzles is great too.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Oh my, the writing is bad. Holy cow, it's so bad that it's distracting. Wow! If sophomoric declarations like this appeals to you, then we have a bestseller. Yes, I know, sex sells and that's fine, but there has got to be better erotica out there.<br /><br />It's impossible to review this book without revealing something about myself. If I write that the sex is wild and insane, then does that imply that I have a boring sex life? And if I write that the sex is plain vanilla, then does that imply that I have kinky sex life? So, although I do have my opinions about the sex in the book, I'll keep my personal life private.<br /><br />I will say this though, the writing is atrocious. The best part of the book takes place entirely in the reader's own imagination. While that doesn't sound like a criticism, as all novels take place in reader's imagination, it is and let me explain.<br /><br />Good writing guides the imagination and takes it to new heights. The words in Fifty Shades ground and stifle your imagination. Just as your mind is starting to picture a scene, your budding reverie is immediately struck down by the hundredth \\"wow\\" and the millionth \\"oh my\\". *Poof* all of a sudden you are brought back down to the real world of bad writing. Cue eye roll.<br /><br />This book also brought out a violent side of me that I never knew I had. I too wanted to beat the crap out of the heroine. Oh my! And not just her, but also her subconscious and especially her inner goddess. Wow, that inner goddess was seriously pissing me off.<br /><br />With my overwhelmingly negative critique, you might be wondering why two stars instead of one. Well, it isn't boring. The pages fly by quickly. Even though I am very much disappointed in this book, I still want to know what happens next. So, I couldn't possibly rate it only one star if I am curious about the next two books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of my favorite games.  A great way to spend the time waiting for the machanic to finish with the car.

0439023513|5.0|At first, I thought \\"Mockingjay\\" wasn't as great as book one and two but the last 50 or 60 pages completely took me by surprise. Yes, it ends sadly and not like I expected. But perhaps that's the point the author is trying to make......that war changes people forever and life can never be normal again. This series was my favorite series EVER!
B006VA57CY|5.0|I don't understand these people that think season one was so much better than season two. BOTH are wonderful, and addictive! I started season one on a Friday night and had finished it and season two by Saturday afternoon. I could not stop and found the depiction of Downton during wartime to be very interesting. As with season one, there is romance, intrigue, and *gasp* murder. Go watch it now, you will only be sorry that season three is not out yet!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once I started, I couldn't stop! This was a great book! Sensual but also a mystery... I have finished all three books and can't wait for the movie! Love my Kindle Fire too! It makes reading so fun!
B004EF6632|5.0|I watched this miniseries after Downton Abbey,so as you can imagine, I had high expectations. It was outstanding! I was completely engrossed in the story and watched all four parts in one sitting. It is so romantic without being over the top and perfectly acceptable for all ages to view. If you like Downton Abbey, you should definitely watch this miniseries as well as Wives and Daughters!
B000001GG6|5.0|I have not purchased this yet, but the YouTube video of it is mind blowing.  So perfect in every way. EVERY WAY. Zimerman is so incredibly sensitive on the keyboard.  The Wiener so sensitive and perfect in timing.  None better. Not Gulda, Gould, Brendel.  This is incredible.<br /><br />Update - I now rate this a distant second behind Gulda.  Gulda just took awhile to grow on me.  Zimerman is incredibly precise, but Gulda is an emotional powerhouse.
B00402FGEE|5.0|SGU is by far the best of the three Stargate series'.  SGU is definitely different from both SG1 and Atlantis with many fans finding that SGU was not their particular cup of tea because of it.  SGU is filmed more like a documentary with a greater concentration on character development and the interpersonal relationships of the cast rather then on the individual missions to the planets through the Stargate.  The only defining ongoing storyline/plot is that of the crew struggling to find a way back to Earth from the Destiny.  Otherwise, all of the other plots are either self-contained and wrapped up in one to three episodes.  The individual plots, however, are mentioned by various characters throughout the series.<br /><br />The cast is diverse and led by the brilliant Robert Carlyle (currently on ABC's Once Upon A Time).  Any fan of Carlyle's will enjoy this show even without any knowledge of the Stargate franchise.<br /><br />It is truly a shame SGU was cancelled after only two seasons.  The network did not give this series a true chance to build an audience.  The only reason SGU was cancelled was because of ratings & production costs- not because of the acting, writing, or overall quality of the program.  Currently only season one is available on bluray with no word on whether or not Region 1 will get a season two bluray release.  So if you are buying season one on bluray, feel free to give up your search for season two because you won't find it and go ahead and purchase it on DVD for now.  A direct to DVD/bluray movie had been planned but has since been shelved along with plans for a third SG1-based film and a Atlantis film.  If you're curious as to what would have happened had the show come back for a third season, simply Google \\"Stargate: Universe beyond season 2\\" and \\"Joseph Mallozzi\\" and you will be taken to Mallozzi's weblog detailing the writers & producers ideas about where they would have gone with the series had they been able to continue.
B008FH6SUQ|5.0|This is a definitely a solid effort on Chris Brown's part (of course in my opinion)! I was very excited to see that Chris has semi-returned to his old R&B days but with a new, improved, and mature tone although there are some pop songs (enjoyable and fun) and also some rap (his newfound obsession). I would even go so far as to say it is a step up from last year's F.A.M.E.!
B0073PZIYI|5.0|Eye candy for males and females. Decent story line, not overwhelming effects but everything needed to make the movie real enough to enjoy. My wife and I both enjoyed this movie and suggested it to friends.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really do not give many books 5 stars but this one I have to say was a solid 5 star read for me.<br />A problem that I find in many romance books is that you have a story that you are completely engaged in only to have the last part of the book let you down.  Or sometimes you have to suffer through chapters and chapters of set up before you even begin to care about the story.  Or even worse a doormat h.  This story has none of those problems.  From the very start of the book you are pulled in by the tension.  There is no shortage of angst in this book, from the very start you don't want to put the book down.  What is even better is that the h calls the H out on his bad behavior.  I LOVED THIS h!  LOVE her!  Let's face it, strong h are hard to come by in romance books.  This h is strong, doesn't back down even if she plays a role of a submissive in bed.  Most of the time authors tell you how strong a h is only to have a h act completely spineless around the H.  This author creates a strong h to match the alpha H in this story and it makes for an awesome read.  The author doesn't need to tell us how strong she is because we know by the h actions.  I loved the fact that she was jealous and lets him know it.  She doesn't sit idly by and pretend everything is ok and then go cry in the corner.  She confronts him and tells him exactly what is wrong.  I loved the H too.  What is really great about him is that just when you are about to hate him, he wins you over again.  He is completely into the h.  He is a possessive, alpha, completely in love and incredibly hot.  Just when I began to question his loyalty to the h, his actions and words would win me over.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the sequel of this book!
B005T87QCI|2.0|Played it for about 10 minutes and got bored. Very repetitive and is not very fun. But has all of the Characters from the movie and all of the venues also.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought this headset for my husband.  He absolutely LOVES it!! My boys also use it when playing games.  It keeps me from having to ask them to turn down the tv 20 times and they love the sound quality they get.  I would recommend this product to anyone who loves gaming!  It's also great to use when watching movies on the laptop.

0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe, can really shake your moral foundation if you let it.  Written in the mid-twentieth century by a native Nigerian, Things Fall Apart is meant to depict the true culture of late nineteenth century West Africa.  In my opinion, Achebe succeeds in dispelling the myth that Africa was and is a cultureless, savage land full of senseless violence.  By telling the story of Okonkwo, his family, and their community, Achebe shows that though Nigerian culture may be very different from that of Western Europe or North America, it is no less a culture with structure and reason.<br />Chinua Achebe was born the son of a protestant Missionary in Nigeria in 1930.  Though he was educated primarily in English, he was fully immersed in the Ibo culture surrounding him.  Things Fall Apart is a novel he published in 1959 in response to widespread ignorance of African Culture.  The average western European or North American viewed Africa as cultureless and language-less, and Achebe decided that he may be able to change a few opinions.<br />Chinua Achebe's most important tool was language.  Achebe could have written in Ibo, but he chose to publish his novel in English. This was to be sure he reached his target audience, ignorant white men.  However, he chose very deliberately to use some Ibo words; words that cannot be translated precisely into English because of their complex nature.  These words include, among others, \\"nso-ani\\", describing a religious offense and \\"ajbala\\", referring to either a woman or to a man stripped of his titles.  He included a glossary of rough translations in the back of the novel, which I found to be instrumental in my understanding of the novel.<br />Another tool used by the author is emotional attachment to the main character, Okonkwo.  Okonkwo is a man's man with multiple wives living on his compound. From the perspective of a middle-class European, Okonkwo may be considered a savage. However, Achebe is sure to fully immerse his readers in the Ibo culture from the very beginning.  Okonkwo begins his journey as a respected man and I quickly became attached to him through an understanding of his cultural background.  The Ibo culture is patriarchal to the extreme. As a sheltered North American, it could have been a hard concept for me to appreciate, but being captivated by Achebe's writings I could not help but be swept into the Ibo culture right alongside Okonkwo.<br />I would categorize Things Fall Apart as a work of historical fiction.  The novel is very political and not an easy read.  But I felt at its conclusion that it was worth my time.  Things Fall Apart gives perspective that is otherwise lacking in my education thus far.  Anybody remotely interested in civil rights or in unfamiliar cultures would do well to give it a chance.<br />

B007IQX1G4|1.0|I generally like off-beat comedies and thought that I would love this one.  I was surprised that I literally hated every character - except for the old high school friend that was beaten because people thought that he was gay in high school - I only disliked him.  The man that she was in love with could easily see through her ploys, but didn't stand up to her or dismiss her, his wife was a wuss who just let her ruin the naming day even though her intent and drunkenness was obvious, and the main character was beyond self-absorbed and right down mean.  It's hard to connect with a movie when every character sucks.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Ico and SotC are two of the greatest PlayStation games ever, and SotC is probably one of the greatest games OF ALL TIME! They are both completely different from each other and from what 99% of other game studios are shelling out. If you haven't played them before, you need to buy this 2 pack immediately.<br /><br />If you played one or both of these games on PS2, let me add that the HD graphics are great. The colors are brighter and the image is sharper in both games, and it's really worth seeing the improvements and playing through again if you liked them the first time.<br /><br />There are also PS3 achievements to collect if you are into that kind of thing, and some extra behind the scenes movies that I haven't looked at yet. Amazon sold this 2 pack for 20 USD, which would be worth it for one of these games in HD, so that stuff is just gravy.
1401937519|5.0|I loved this book!  I'm not a big reader, but I couldn't put this book down. It gives such a powerful message to those who are willing to listen. I'm glad Anita Moorjani shared her experience with the world. It was so touching, that I bought one for a dear friend of mine.  Amazing.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|My heart kept racing even after the movie was over.  I also was in the Navy for six years so seeing a battleship up close again was great.  I loved it when I saw the older retired men on that old ship.  I just knew what was going to happen next.  I think a great chick and guy flick!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not even a reader, but I thought I would give this series a whirl. I read the \\"sample\\" on my kindle and couldn't put it down. I loved easch and every book. Very risque, but wonderfully written!
B0086DBE62|4.0|Tarsem Singh creates enough tension, brilliantly exhibited by Roberts (she is deliciously hateable), to pull you in and make you want to know what happens next.  From the other reviews I read I was afraid I wouldn't care about what happened, but almost immediately  the underdog status of Snow White is made visceral.<br />The costumes! Eiko Ishioka (who you'll notice in the final credits has the film dedicated to her memory) has taken the very best and most amusing from the 18th century, adds some fantastical flare from our favorite fairy tales and creates yummy eye candy with fabric and color.<br />The actress who plays Snow White isn't serious enough for my taste.  I was always afraid she was going to break character, but I'm highly critical when it comes to performance.  This is where we credit the casting director, because what the camera picks up from her look alone lends enough vulnerability to her character to make us want to champion her.<br />The dwarves are all leading men handsome and individually quirky and hand in their own fine performances. The familial/bachelor buddy feel of their clan makes you feel included on some inside joke.<br />Add a  prince that any woman would accept in that fairy tale  role, some quirky fun writing and a couple unexpected turns at then end, and you come out with a satisfying little romp.<br />Not a bad way to spend the better part of two hours.

B0017SWSCW|2.0|I am a fan  of the author, and will slog on faithfuully to the end , but this book was not nearly as good as all of the rest! I am near the end and it has finally piqued my interest. Way too  slow getting started.
B0086700CM|2.0|I bought this game because my cousin recommended it. I thought it was fine, but it smudged so much it won't let me jump, turn, or slide. It really interferes with the gameplay.
1400095204|5.0|This is an amazing book. I believe the author is the Gabriel Garcia Marquez of Nigeria; an amazing almost poetic writing style that draws the reader into the characters lives. When I finished the book I was left with a lingering feeling of what happened to everybody after the end of the book, they were really as far as I was concerned. I was also left with a feeling of sadness. The only other book to influence me in this way was 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'.<br /><br />Having spent time in Africa and India I could relate to things about everyday life, such as the conflicts between servants, the wealth gap and hanging out with intellectuals. It also offered a glimpse into the Biafra war - something I only had a passing knowledge of beforehand. This book is certainly food the soul and those who want to exercise their minds.
0618477942|5.0|One of my favorite books of the past five years. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something interesting to read. I found it thoroughly engaging. I'm anxious to see where her writing takes her next.
0345803485|5.0|I've read the 50 Shades series twice in 3 weeks and I'm not a book reader what so ever.  A friend told me about this \\"mom porn\\" book and thought nothing of it until I saw it sitting on the corner of one of the tables at a warehouse store.  The series is an unthinking, fun, fast and delicious read!  If you're looking for a romance novel that's, lovey dovey, historically referenced, intellectually stimulating or Judy Blume innocent...don't read this book! Walk away!! Don't listen to your friends and go pick up Johanna Lindsey or classic Bronte novel.<br /><br />I've read some other reviews that talk about 50 Shades reads like high school, teenage hormones run a muck.  Excuse me!!! This is not tween novel material by any means.  It is very adult and quite exquisitely explicit.  Besides, the adolescent moments are a product of the 2 main characters naivety entering into their first true romantic relationship. It sounds sweet and innocent but no no no!!<br /><br />Readers, read the 50 Shades series for what it is. Page turning sex on paper that will leave you smiling and giggling and spouting one liners at work with your book club co-workers.  That ain't so bad. :)
B007AJFSJW|3.0|The text is clear, and to-the-point. Professor Krugman uses everyday examples to illustrate basic principles of economic reasoning, and brings them to bear on current policy issues. It's a valuable contribution to policy debate in the US, especially in an election year when candidates are presenting us with a fork in the road: the left turning toward continued management and wealth redistribution powers for government and the right toward austerity and renewed trust in wealthy captains of industry to shape America's future.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|What a great gift from Amazon! It's so nice to read 'old' books again and this time because I want to and not because it's a school assignement . It's been interesting to discuss with friends how some of our views and perception about the book change with maturity.

B008CWD17M|5.0|This comes from my review on Backstage Axxess<br /><br />It was thirty years ago when four of progressive rock's most accomplished musicians came together to form Asia. Even before the band's self-titled debut arrived in record bins, there was a great deal of anticipation, and while some prog rock purists dismissed Asia as overly commercial, fans embraced the band's spectacular debut.<br /><br />In July the quintessential lineup of Asia; Wetton, Howe, Downes and Palmer, will release XXX. The title acknowledges the bands thirtieth anniversary, and is this lineups third album of original material since they reformed in 2006.<br /><br />Their last album, \\"Omega,\\" was tremendous and somehow the band has managed to outdo themselves with \\"XXX.\\" Fans of Asia have come to expect catchy songs, but this collection really exceeds all expectations.<br /><br />What is unusual about \\"XXX,\\" is that the truly great songs are on the second half of the album. If this were a two sided album the second side would be the better of the two. The opening songs, like \\"Tomorrow the World,\\" and \\"Faithful,\\" are great songs, but the album's set is constructed in a way that each song keeps getting better until the closing song, \\"Ghost of a Chance,\\" which is the best song this lineup has ever recorded. I say that as a fan who saw this band on their first US tour and also as the owner of the entire Wetton era catalog.<br /><br />One other thing that seems different is the tandem of Wetton and Palmer on bass and drums. They just seem to be playing together better than they ever have, this is especially noticeable on \\"Al Gatto Nero,\\" a song that is incredibly catchy.<br /><br />What really makes \\"XXX\\" work is that Asia does not sound like a supergroup, they sound like a band of friends who enjoy performing together. If you enjoyed the band's debut thirty years ago you will appreciate this collection of songs. I highly recommend \\"XXX\\" it exceeds expectations and when you have a lineup of Asia's caliber, that is saying a lot.<br /><br />Original link is here[...]re[...]

1466401885|2.0|when I was in middle school and high school. That I would be a beautiful girl leaving behind a dark past who attracts the untamable bad boy who cleans up his act (mostly) for me, then some disaster strikes, I'm juggling two boys who are vying for my attention, but it eventually it all works out for the better. I would have liked to read this in high school, but not now.<br /><br />Not only was the plot line unrealistic, but the setting and such were so high school. With rumors and people staring in college, no one cares enough in college to stare at you for talking to someone unlikely. Not only did that irritate me, but so did the fighting. Travis is this badass who beats the hell out of anyone that looks at Abby wrong, in the real world thats called assault and you can go to jail for smashing someone's face into a headlight, drunk or not.<br /><br />I just bumped this down from three stars to two the more I think about it. I have a big problem with Young adult books that make life so unrealistic. I read a lot of these books and was expecting more from college knowing that it wouldn't be like that, but it raised expectations slightly. The volatility of their relationship (Abby and Travis) to go from just hanging out to living together to broken up by Thanksgiving! Thats barely a three month relationship in which she admits shes a virgin and sleeps with him. And we know that they don't sleep together until after a least a month of knowing him.<br /><br />I can understand these two damaged people coming together and having their own dysfunctional relationship, but still there were sooooo many red flags. Trashing the apartment after she left him, getting her name tattooed on him after only 2 months together, beating the shit (please excuse my language but there is no better word) or of a few guys because they said something about Abby. I was actually disturbed when none of this seemed to phase her and she married him anyway! (Which, he got the ring at an undisclosed time before Thanksgiving when they were still barely in a hatching relationship. Mind you she was also only 19 as this happened and the book spans from (I assume) August to March/April.<br /><br />The book was funny at times and made me smile, but in this book, the bad outweighed the good. The only thing this book was missing was having Abby actually get seriously injured ( she escaped an attempted rape and death by fire with a few scratches) and it would have been a perfect new teen drama for the CW.<br /><br />Who do I recommend this to? I'm not really sure because I think it is too old for middle school and early high school because of the sex scenes that made me squirm, but I think its a little juvenile for college aged kids. This book is probably good for someone who just enjoys a good YA, but someone mature enough to handle the content.<br /><br />As a side note: I just read a blog post by MacGuire in which she expressed anger about people negatively reviewing her book. She brings up the point that there are people who have dysfunctional relationships, and I won't argue with that, I just don't think that this story should be geared toward Young Adults because I remember being that age, and thinking that I wanted my own Edward Cullen to watch me sleep, but it wasn't until I was older and in a good relationship that I saw all the problems with what I wanted, or thought I wanted. My only fear is that a young girl will think thats okay and it turns out to be a bad situation. I'm not saying that every girl is naive and will think that Travis Maddox is the perfect guy (although the amount of reviewers that say so is terrifying), but I am saying that when marketing a book to a group that is known for their impulsive behavior and ability to be swayed by peers and media, there needs to be a certain amount of care given to the relationships portrayed on the pages.me before Thanksgiving when they were still barely in a hatching relationship.

B007WFR1MQ|5.0|I've been a fear factory fan since obsolete came out. I was about 13 when it did, I went straight to demanufacture after obsolete. Both demanu and obsolete were by far my favorite ff records. Everything since obsoletely has been kind of \\"mehhhh...\\" for me until now. The industrialist has everything I missed about fear factory. 8 brutal tracks with just completely epic clean chorus vocal from burton which I fell in love with listening to demanufacture and obsolete in the 90's. Every song is truly absolutely fantastic. Mechanize was great to have dino back, but this new record just pulls at my soul with passion and curbstomps my face with aggression. I'm blow away with the industrialist 100%. Yes there's only 8 tracks but they're all amazing. I don't mind the programmed drums eigther give a nice demanufacture 90's feel. Don't hate on the programmed drums eigther you noobs. Don't forget they still play sick sets live with legendary drummers. Rip gene and raymond, sucks to see two of the most incredible drummers leave, but I have complete faith in dino and burton that they picked an amazing replacement. Can't wait to see them live again this month.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I wasn't prepared for the depth of this book. I got Slammed because I found the concept of slam poetry interesting, the first few pages I read in the sample were effortless reading, and I liked the fact that this wasn't going to be a typical love story, but rather a story with obstacles. I seek out books that mimic real life, as in stories that aren't told like they are wrapped up in a perfect box with a neat little bow and this book delivers that and more. I just wasn't prepared for the incredible depth of the work and depths of emotion it took me to. Not to sound cliche', but I literally laughed, cried, and FELT deeply for the characters and their storylines. I've already purchased the follow-up novel to Slammed and look forward to continuing my journey with these characters.
140131046X|4.0|As someone who also lost sight of their religion, I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me that I'm not the only one and that you can always go back. I also think that this book had a lot of important lessons that people never learn or always forget. Such as respecting other people's religions- we live in a world with so much hate an animosity between races and religious groups that to see Albom visiting both a synagogue and a church, and also pointing out the similarities between the Pastor he is hesitant to trust, and the Rabbi he grew up with.<br /><br />Albom skillfully tells the story of both of these men, starting near the end for his Rabbi when \\"The Rab\\" as he is called asks Albom to be the one to write his eulogy, and starting at the beginning of the Pastor's, Henry's, life. The similarities are obvious the whole way through, and they come together nicely when Albom is told that Henry is also called \\"The Rab\\".<br /><br />Henry's story was one that was truly moving. The way that he worked his way out of a lower class neighborhood into drugs and prison and again into drugs then back to prison and finally into a church as a pastor. I think Henry proved that with the right amount of inspiration, dedication and divine intervention, you could do anything. It was amazing how he would go from having thousands of dollars to not even being able to pay the electric bill for the church.<br /><br />I think one of my favorite anecdote was about The Rab and the priest. After the priest made a comment (many years ago, no time period provided just long ago) to one of the Jewish worshipers (please correct me if there is a better term) saying \\"The Nazi's didn't get enough of you if you ask me.\\" How crass, and of a priest no less! A Catholic priest. So to ease tensions between the two religions the men walked arm in arm in front of the Catholic school as the children were released for the day.<br /><br />The Rab's acceptance of other religions was inspiring and I wish all the other ignorant people could have just a tenth of the tolerance that he showed in this book. Although I was expecting it, I still cried when he died and Albom included the eulogy that he wrote. This book was very moving and a nice short book for someone who doesn't have a lot of time.other ignorant people could have just a tenth of the tolerance that he showed in this book.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|I'm as much of a snob as anyman on earth, always looking to criticize,find fault, demonstrate superiority, etc.This movie is cynic proof;its witty, its thoughtful,its long, but well paced.<br /><br />Downy does his usual \\"smarter than thou\\" thing which theoretically should annoy everyone with half a brain, but you just have to give it to him,the man has a brilliant sense of comedic timing. I want to hate him so badly, but the man can just flat out act.Excellent chemistry between Watson and Holmes, excellent repartee, a story that strains credulity, true, but you just can't help but to have a good time! Rest assured, this is fun for thinkers.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|I was overly suprised - and just a hint - the little preview clips you can find that make it look like it is a anime insert film, no, bad choice to post --- they are little (very little and few) story transitions for effect.  I am even more impressed , that this was done on a budget -- the acting I felt was real and well done, the music score was outstanding, and the choice of film media and use of color filters made the entire film very rich and much depth for the eyes.  Zombie make ups were also, just wonderful. Was not sure about a period piece zombie film but the move explained it and it was sensible and cohesive - so kudos to the writer(s)....the feeling you get during and after watching it -- is that you just traveled along with a man, that has found Hell come to earth and with it, brought all the demented and diseased souls of the dammned, to possess and wander about, in the bodies of the dead.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Over all a great read!! I read it in a day because I couldnt put it down...As much as I dont agree with the fighting, arguements, and obessiveness it portrayed...I loved the book and how it ended...will defenitely read it again!
0307957934|2.0|I've loved other books by Robert Harris--\\"Fatherland,\\" \\"The Ghost,\\" \\"Archangel\\"--but this left me saying \\"Wha?\\" I am not a techie or follower of the S&P, so I did not really understand a lot of the book. The plot itself was interesting and kept me going to the very disappointing ending--but: is that all there is?
0425263908|4.0|I love the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy and was excited when the reviews mentioned this book was similar.  Similar is one thing, but I wasn't expecting to read the same story.  Although some things are slightly different, the plot and even small story details are the same.  Take the characters names: Eva and Ana? They are both assistants straight out of college moving to a big city? Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading the book and will read the rest of the series but be warned it's a copy cat.  She could have at least made the series 4 books instead of the trilogy like Fifty Shades.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I had never heard good things about this before I saw it.  After seeing it, I have no idea why not.  The star is great in the role and the supporting actors are also good.  The story isn't the most unique but it adds some interesting twists on the Utopia and after the first half hour picks up speed and tells a good story well.<br /><br />If you have any interest in scifi, see this at least once.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|I dont know why they say the blu ray is in bad quality. The thing is that coz of these strange reviews, I did not buy the blu ray right away.<br />I now bought it and with putting it in my player I expected like a dvd quality. BUT it is in super blu ray quality!!!!<br /><br />I dont know other technical stuff, but to me it is enough that the sound is perfect and the picture quality is really blu ray. And both are great.<br /><br />I dislike these longs reviews leading us viewers to false decisions. I nearly would have never bought that movie!!!!<br /><br />I will never really read those reviews here again. I will just buy when I feel like and see then myself.

B006M9NJFG|4.0|This canteen and cup are awesome. I had no bad taste problems with the canteen or cup and in the the two weeks I have had this I have put at least 15 gallons of water through it. Every last bit tasted just fine. No chemical tastes. The only bad thing about this kit is that the rubber coating on the handles doesn't stand up to direct heat. However Gerber does say that the canteen should be placed well above or next to a fire with the handles facing the outside of the fire not directly into the fire as I used it. So Im sure if used as directed it would be fine. Even when using it as I all that happened is the rubber hardened and fell off leaving you with a normal canteen cup with metal handles. No big deal, just a little uglier,really who cares it still works great.
B00364K6YW|5.0|The BBC miniseries of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" took roughly 23 weeks to produce. Extraordinary attention to detail was paid to every scene, from costume to food to dialogue, and it shows. Jennifer Ehle is beautiful, intelligent, and spirited as Elizabeth Bennett, and Colin Firth has no equal (or even a remote rival) in his portrayal of Mr. Darcy. The 2005 film starring Kiera Knightley is a small lightbulb (and accordingly dim) next to this masterpiece.<br /><br />If you only watch one screen version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", it should be this one.

0439023521|4.0|Captivating, riveting, and thoroughly enjoyable, The Hunger Games was a worthwhile read. It was a slow moving in the beginning but halfway through I couldn't put it down until I finished it. There were plot twists and turns that kept it flowing very nicely, and you couldn't help rooting for Katniss, the main character, the whole time. I thought the idea for the book using a post-apocalyptic North American setting was fresh and inventive. I was intrigued by the many different flora that were presented such as the trackerjackets and mockingjays. I'm looking forward to watching the movie now and reading the next two books in the series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was fantastic. Hugh Howey did a wonderful job describing the characters and their surroundings.  Really, I had to set aside a couple hours to read it because I wanted to know what happened next.  Can't wait to see more in the series and to read his other works.  Anyone else think this would make a good movie, too?
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|This is a decent hidden objects game, but there are a few flaws that stand out. The \\"story\\" is difficult to follow, and characters are introduced with no explanation of who they are.My biggest complaint is the way they label some objects. They call an oboe a flute, for example. That makes it confusing for the player. If its free I say try it out, but don't pay for this app.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Check the link below to see the what is cut from the broadcast version. Us who have watched and loved the DVD versions will be very disappointed. Friends is a great show, however this is ridiculous. Cut and paste the link, select a season and select and episode. Everything highlighted in BLUE will be cut from this Broadcast version of Friends on Blu-ray. Very disappointed.    uncutfriendsepisodes(dot)tripod(dot)com    Some of the cuts are not too bad, however check out the episodes below and you'll probably be shocked at what will be cut out in these new Blu-ray Broadcast versions.    Look at episodes like...  Season 8, Ep 801, The one after \\"I Do\\"  Season 8, Ep 809, The one with the Rumor

I read all 3 books in less than 2 weeks.  Such a great love story... but you have to get past the sex .. and there's lots of sex in these books.. Just give it a chance and let the story take you through.

1846613299|5.0|BOOK REVIEW<br /><br />APPROPRIATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) IN IRELAND<br />A Handbook for Family Lawyers and their Clients<br /><br />By Josepha Madigan<br />Plus a team of specialist contributors<br /><br />Family Law - Jordan Publishing Ltd<br /><br />ISBN:  978 184661 329 6<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />ADR BY ANOTHER NAME: A POSITIVE AND PRACTICAL APPROACH OF INTEREST TO UK PRACTITIONERS AS WELL AS THOSE IN IRELAND -<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />What's in a name?  In England and Wales, `ADR' means `Alternative Dispute Resolution'; in Ireland ADR stands for Appropriate Dispute Resolution. (In Australia, the same process is known as External Dispute Resolution.) So is there a difference?  Does the difference in nomenclature indicate a difference in attitude or orientation, or ethos?<br /><br />This rather absorbing book by Josepha Madigan, with its clear and practical approach, enables lawyers and other professionals in both jurisdictions to compare the UK system - if that's the right word - with its Irish counterpart and vice versa.<br /><br />Note that the expert author is a member of the Law Society of England and Wales as well as the Law Society of Ireland.<br /><br />In addition to a lengthy list of qualifications in this field, she is a Resolution trained and accredited mediator, specialising in family disputes and separating clients.<br /><br />It seems that in Ireland, barristers and solicitors have a duty to provide information and advice on mediation, following the draft Mediation Bill 2012  This of course indicates a stronger stance on mediation than that which currently prevails in England and Wales, where practitioners are encouraged by many judges -- but not all -- to mediate, or seek a collaborative solution before going to court.<br /><br />The point is made in the foreword to the book that in Ireland (as elsewhere) family law issues are becoming so much more complex, with an ever-expanding range of issues and participants, such as single parents, same sex couples, sperm donors, foreign partners (whose cultural differences need to be recognised) and so on.<br /><br />The adversarial system in many of these cases is herein described as a `blunt instrument' for resolving such disputes.  The remark is made that `all initiatives (including mediation) designed to improve the resolution of family law disputes are to be welcomed'.<br /><br />The publication of this book is therefore timely, it being, apparently, the first title on this topic devoted to requirements of Irish professionals, as well as their clients who can also benefit from the practical guidance provided on ADR.  Certainly, the author explores the pitfalls of ADR as well as its advantages.<br /><br />The book is designed, she states `to empower clients with a viable and often more appropriate mechanism for resolving family law disputes' in the hope that the book will emerge as `a reference tool for the judiciary, lawyers, mediators, collaborative practitioners, counsellors psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, GPs and all those who are at the coalface of...relationship breakdown.'<br /><br />For all those who find themselves at this selfsame `coalface', this book should rank as a must-read work of reference and an invaluable acquisition for any professional involved in this complex and sensitive area. Reference tools abound, including tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, as well as a very useful table of European and International Legislation.  The publication date is cited as at May 2012.h an ever-expanding range of issues and participants, such as single parents, same sex couples, sperm donors, foreign partners (whose cultural differences need to be recognised) and so on.<br /><br />The adversarial system in many of these cases is herein described as a `blunt instrument' for resolving such disputes.

For everyone else, the below lines from the script are from episode 809, season 8: The Rumor (The one with Brad Pitt at Thanksgiving).

0140120416|5.0|Ordered this because I took a semester of Russian Language/history last year and my boyfriend and his family are from Azerbaijan and speak Russian.  I find it very helpful and goes at a good pace for someone who has had little experience or none.  Not too bad of a price either. I'd definitely recommend.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't believe the hype.  It's so poorly written that while reading it, I cringed with embarrassment so often that people around me would ask if there was something wrong.  Yep, this book is wrong.  Not at all sexy.  Do yourself a favor and try some Lauren Dane or Maya Banks or Sylvia Day or Bethany Kane/Beth Kerry or any number of REAL authors of erotica.  Do yourself another favor and borrow this rubbish from the library if you feel the need to waste some time, but DO NOT waste your money on 50 Shades of Blah.
B007BZM30M|4.0|My daughter (11) loves this song.  I thought it was cute, not offensive so I'll listen to it when its on.<br /><br />I was in a hotel in China watching Channel V (vee not 5) when I first saw the video.  I laughed my butt off and instantly bought the song for MY iPhone.  Anyone who can giggle at themselves and have that much fun in a video deserves to be supported.<br /><br />Is it life changing?  No.  But if you need a song to change your life, you must have a pretty lame life.<br />Is it fun and catchy?  Yes.<br />Do I think about the video and giggle a little whenever I hear this song on my iPhone?  Yes.

B005JJCMSU|1.0|Let's talk  about a terrible low budget movie. 90% of this worthless movie was taped in one room. For the longest hour and half I heard\\" if you don't open the safe I will kill your wife\\". Now for some men, this would have been music to their ears, \\"shoot away\\".However, it was just repetitive, boring, and a absolute insult to watch. Please don't rent or buy.
B007V508CC|4.0|The boys in Maroon 5 are seeing some of the same backlash that any band finds once they become popular. This album just feels like the natural progression of a contemporary pop act. I don't mean that in a bad way. I have to say that the inclusion of a lot of outside influences might not be the best way to go with a band that has a very enjoyable sound. There were times that they sounded too much like Matchbox 20. I like Matchbox 20...but I don't need 2 of them.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|if you need your libido stimulated. you may find it in this \\"just short of pornography\\" novel.<br />the writing is not in any way superior, in fact a junior in high school could probably write more<br />eloquently.<br />A good lesson on how to \\"cash in\\" on sex.

B004SBX112|3.0|For those of you complaining about the app not letting you update unless you're on wifi, you're wrongly sabotaging the ratings for this product. The reason why you're being forced to update over wifi is because of the settings for the Amazon App itself. Press the &quot;menu&quot; button and go to &quot;settings.&quot;  By default it's set to update over wifi if the file is bigger than 10 or 20mb's, depending what yours was originally set to. Make sure you raise the limit before trying to download a file of this size. That should clear up the problem for most people.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|My boyfriend got the Omnibus and started reading it next to me. A few minutes later, he gasped out loud and said \\"*TWIST*\\", which piqued my curiosity. When he had finished the whole series (thus far, anyway), he casually mentioned he thought I might like it.<br /><br />I often suffer from the disappointment of high expectations, and I am hyper-critical of most works of art. I was moderately interested by the premise of this book, which my spoiler-hating boyfriend said was \\"it's some time in a dystopian future, and all of humanity lives in an underground silo, but it's not really clear why.\\" However, from what I understood, it was a self-published author, which didn't necessarily bode well in my opinion. Not that I have the utmost faith in the publishing industry, but it does tend to weed out absolute chaff, and any author can benefit from professional editorship etc etc...so I went into the world with moderately tempered expectations.<br /><br />I start reading it on my boyfriend's Kindle. Towards the end of the first section, I gasp out loud...*TWIST*! I was officially hooked, and I love that the entree into the universe can be a stand-alone story. It's the best kind of tease. I zoomed through the rest of the Omnibus over the next two days. Instead of stumbling over minor plot holes and clunky characters, as I often do in science fiction, I found myself only taking pauses to marvel at how tight the writing was, and how well thought out the plot and pacing were.<br /><br />I didn't realize as I read that there was already a 6th book. I felt kind of spent as I finished the epilogue of book 5, and then my bf mentioned the next book. He assures me that it's just as good. Reading through 1-5 at such a break-neck pace, I felt almost winded...I had this feeling like I'd finished a few marathons, and then at the finish line someone yelled \\"OK! Just 26.2 more miles to go!\\" I just kind of mentally collapsed, wanting to soak in the ideas of the books I'd just read.<br /><br />But I'm already compelled to start up again...it's so nice to have something to look forward to.<br /><br />Well done, sir.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I just want to reiterate what others are saying.  I am a huge Fiona fan, loved all of her previous work.  There is no other songwriter that understands relationships better and is better at expressing it.  The lyrics, excellent keyboard playing and just her voice - she is a genius.<br /><br />That being said, I really didn't like this CD at first.  I was hugely disappointed.  But...........I kept listening.  Around the 7th listen it hit me how truly great this CD is.  Love Anything We Want, Hot Knife and Every Single Night.  Love when Fiona sings \\"That's where the pain comes in\\" in Every Single Night.  She belts it.  What a talent.<br /><br />I was at the show in NYC at Roseland Ballroom in '99 where she had the breakdown - a huge disappointment for me.  I have not been able to see her since.  I really appreciated the DVD that came with the deluxe edition.<br /><br />Please listen again if you were turned off.  You will change your mind.  I promise.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|The Google Play Store doesn't offer the ad-free version for Angry Birds Rio anymore, but they offer a newer version with more levels, but lots of ads. Here's how you can get the best of both worlds... Get this ad-free version here, then go to the Google Play Store and hit your menu button to go to  &quot;My Apps. &quot; It will show that you have Angry Birds Rio and that there's an update available. DOWNLOAD IT! Even though it's from 2 different stores, it works fine. It will give you the extra levels in the update and keep the game ad-free as well. Also, while you're at the Google Play Store, there's an app by Pierrick Omurphy called Angry Birds Backup. It's free and backs up all 4 Angry Birds games very easily so you won't lose your progress if you delete the apps for any reason. Just a tip, not a solicitation.<br /><br />Angry Birds Rio is my favorite version of Angry Birds. It offers the best graphics and game play of all the Angry Birds games, in my opinion. So there it is... Have fun and happy 4th 8-)
B007FZ7R7W|1.0|I was thinking of a witty title for this review, but I couldn't think of one.  But then I considered it's about Chris Brown's new album and it hit me.  Get it?  it hit me.  Okay, enough with the jokes.  Chris Brown is an idiot, but there's no denying he's talented.  Nothing I say is gonna change your opinion, so if you wanna support an idiot, go out and buy this album.
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|If you did not have the pleasure of seeing Robert Plant & The Band Of Joy in concert, this release is something that you'll want to see. Filmed live on February 9, 2011 at Nashville, Tennessee's War Memorial Auditorium, this concert captures a hot performance on what was a snowy, cold night.<br /><br />Lead singer Robert Plant brings his 40+ years of singing experience and his new-found love for American music, plus his old repertoire, singer/guitarist Patty Griffin brings her gospel/soul/country-style vocals plus some excellent acoustic guitar rhythm, Buddy Miller brings his arsenal of string instruments, including, acoustic guitars, Wandre electric and a Teo 12-string. He's an excellent picker that lends itself to the Americana roots style of playing, but I feel that he's got a mean streak of rock inside him, which shines while he's playing. Multi-instrumentalist Darrell Scott is a real delight. He plays acoustic, electric, mandola, pedal steel and banjo, plus he's got a hell of a great voice. So full of soul. It's not what you would expect upon first seeing him. Bassist Byron House was brought in by Buddy Miller and does not disappoint. He plays both upright bass and electric four-string both with ease and adds some very tasty bass lines. Percussionist Marco Giovino fills in the blanks and adds so much, but doesn't make an attempt to take center stage.<br /><br />The set list for Live From the Artists Den: Robert Plant & the Band of Joy is pretty standard for the tour, offering up some new songs, some old songs and everything in between.<br /><br />Set list:<br /><br />1. Black Dog<br />2. Angel Dance<br />3. Houses of the Holy<br />4. House of Cards<br />5. Cindy, I'll Marry You Someday<br />6. Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down<br />7. Somewhere Trouble Don't Go<br />8. Tangerine<br />9. A Satisfied Mind<br />10. Move Up<br />11. Down to the Sea<br />12. Ramble On<br />13. Gallows Pole<br />14. In the Mood<br />15. Rock and Roll<br />16. I Bid You Goodnight<br /><br />Long gone is the golden god, flowing lion's mane, cock rock. What you will see in this release is not Led Zeppelin or anything close. It is bits and pieces of Americana, roots, country, soul and gospel goodness. Robert said in an included interview that he now prefers the intimacy of playing at smaller auditoriums and ballrooms. The music that they play requires it. This release captures the live experience so well, with full-stage shots as well as close-up views, it's as if you could have been in the audience that night.<br /><br />Robert Plant has moved on to the Sensational Space Shifters, returning to a more international edge that Plant is known for, but for the brief amount of existance that the Band Of Joy performed, this release captures that time perfectly.<br /><br />Live From the Artists Den: Robert Plant & the Band of Joy will be released on Blu-ray and DVD on July 10 and worldwide on July 9 through Universal Music Group International at all the online retailers, as well as your usual retail stores. I highly recommend that you reserve yourself a copy now.<br /><br />Jeff Strawman<br />[...]e is not Led Zeppelin or anything close.

B008FH6SUQ|2.0|After months of delays and anticipation, Chris Brown's highly anticipated 5th studio album and follow up to the Grammy award winning F.A.M.E. has finally arrived. Fortune's release is just after Brown's two biggest rivals, Usher and R. Kelly, dropped albums of their own, both receiving praise from critics. With all this said, Fortune gives Brown a chance to establish himself as the King of R&B and even the next Michael Jackson. Unfortunately, Fortune fails to do this.<br /><br />Turn Up the Music - The first single from the album is well produced and is a great club banger. Brown's vocals are great and the song brings great energy and anticipation to the album. 9/10<br /><br />Bassline - Wow. After an exciting intro, you get this stupid song about how girls like Brown's \\"bassline\\". It is a huge miss and seems like something you would throw into a mixtape, not a studio album. 1/10<br /><br />Till I Die - Despite cameo's from two of rap's newest stars, Big Sean and Wiz Khalifa, this song is another huge disappointment. Their raps are mediocre and the production is bad. I have respect for all three, but this song really falls flat and is a shell of what it could have been (the next \\"Look at Me Now\\") 4/10<br /><br />Mirage - Brown's vocals are good and the production is much better than the previous songs. However, the song itself is not outstanding. However Nas, one of the greatest Hip-Hop artists ever, throws down a great verse and saves the song. 7.5/10<br /><br />Don't Judge Me - A slow ballad that Brown really excels at. It is reminiscent of Justin Bieber or Drake songs, however is much more polished. You can hear grief and regret in Brown's voice as he tries to get a girl to,well, not judge him. The production is very good and overall the song is a highlight on this album. 7.5/10<br /><br />2012 - This song is a slow sex ballad, one which Brown also excels. Very similar to FAME's \\"No BS\\". 8/10<br /><br />Biggest Fan - Another great song that fits well with the previous two and is very similar. Brown's vocals are very good and the production is great. Reminds me of \\"No BS\\" as well as \\"Superstar\\" by Usher. 9/10<br /><br />Sweet Love - This song had a lot of potential, but the production completely kills the song. While it should have a slow and fluid flow, it does the exact opposite. This could have been the highlight of the album, but this production was just terrible and is a huge disappointment. 5/10<br /><br />Strip - Although a little short and unpolished, Strip is a solid song. It's more fun than anything and the hook can be a little infectious. The production is also good and even Kevin McCall's rap isn't that bad. 7/10<br /><br />Stuck on Stupid - An uptempo ballad that proves to another highlight of the album. The production is very good and Brown's vocals are very good. 9/10<br /><br />4 Years Old - Another very good slow ballad. Brown's vocals are at their best and the production is also very good. In my opinion it is the best song on the album. 9/10<br /><br />Party Hard / Cadillac (Interlude) - More great vocals and production. The Cadillac part features vocals by Sevyn, which really bring new life into the album. 8/10<br /><br />Don't Wake Me Up - Despite annoying use of auto-tune, this song is still pretty good. The production is very good on this track, even though the song seems a little basic and incomplete. Similar to, but not as good as, Usher's song \\"Euphoria\\". 8.5/10<br /><br />Trumpet Lights - The final song pretty much sums the album up: a combination of good vocals,solid production, and ultimately not memorable. I'm surprised this song made the final cut on the album, since it does not really fit with the rest of the album and the hook is pretty stupid. Not the finale I expected from such a talented artist. 2.5/10<br /><br />Ultimately, Fortune is a huge disappointment and is nowhere near the level of Usher and Kelly's recent releases. I recommend that you NOT buy this album unless you are a huge ChrisBrown fan. We can officially say that Brown is not the next Michael Jackson or King of R&B.
B001992NW4|5.0|Hmmm, my oh my, \\"The Exorcist\\" film version is a strange one. First off, and it might be trivial at this point to mention it, the film version is very loosely based upon the novel itself. Friedkin's film is an agnostic treatment of this subject matter, not a truly belief-based interpretation. Even though the director put back in some of the missing \\"carpentry\\" (as Blatty refers to) in the \\"Version You've Never Seen\\", there are still a great deal of unexplained questions. This movie is not really about the occult all that much; it is more of a family-in-crisis kind of drama, with a lot of religious overtones tossed in. The novel includes scenes that make the threat of the supernatural more understandable to the reader (in the film, Chris has no book on occult lore laying around the house, the medium who showed up at her party warning her to take the \\"toy\\" away from Regan, the sub-plot about Karl's daughter, etc. have all been stripped away for this abbreviated film interpretation). In the film, things happen in far too abrupt fashion, with scenes of blasphemy mixed in with scenes of spiritual faith, none of which ever gels completely. Also, as one reviewer on here stated before, Blatty has not really done his best to tell a cohesive story. It appears that there is a battle between good and evil going on, but the old Jesuit priest's conflict with the demon is perhaps one of the most mis-understood pyschological Western-type motifs ever committed to celluloid (everybody keeps referring to the entity as \\"the Devil,\\" or \\"Satan\\", not the real character shown in statue form in the movie). Friedkin's film is far more empathetic to the plight of Chris, and this is no doubt a strong feminist movie (despite poor Linda's abusive scenes) in the director's hands. Therefore, we end up with a movie that is entirely humanist, but no less fascinating (and superbly entertaining, in my opinion, at least). This is not a detective movie, either, despite the brilliant Lee J. Cobb's thankless role. Finally, as for this being a horror film, I ultimately have to disagree with this conclusion...there is nothing here that has the INTENTION to frighten viewers as much as it does to make a viewers THINK, and therefore it is more dramatic (I admit quite intense at times) than scary. One reason this film will stand the test of time (so to speak) and keep fascinating viewers today who might be new to it is simply for the reason that, unlike most of today's scare pictures, this one is about age old ideas concerning themes that we all have some steak in (life and death, c'mon) and a set of terrific performances from every actor involved, despite the thin storyline that they were given to work with, they really bring these performances home in a unique fashion (Miller is intensely good here, but so are Von Sydow, Burstyn, sweet Linda, etc.) Anyway, this movie also has some funny moments that I believe to be intentional (the phone ringing while Karras is listening to the tape comes to mind).<br />As for this BluRay presentation, one could not ask for better. Every extra that any sane person could wish for is here, and the picture and sound are superlative. Earth-shakingly good effects, sound design, etc. After \\"The Exorcist\\", I think the horror film underwent a dramatic revision in terms of the use of sound effects and music, as the old \\"jump out of your seat\\" music that informed you that a scene would be terrifying (like in \\"Psycho\\") would no longer be so obviously, or so routinely, used ever again. I was fortunate enough to see the 2000 extended cut at a local theater a couple of years back on Halloween night, and the experience of watching a good classic movie like this one is always more rewarding than watching these simplistic newer movies that we have nowadays. I enjoy the expanded cut more so because to me it is, in a sense, the most complete version (despite some silly effects shots that really shouldn't have been added). This movie should be a lesson toall of those who wish to make films...effects are always important, but the major special effects are always the actors and the script itself, not the visuals.
B005LAII3U|5.0|Total Recall is more than just couple of directors making a movie. The story of Total Recall is what makes both of these films unique. Not only the story but both films are filmed during different periods of time. Relating the two movies without watching the new film is not fare.
1609611543|5.0|This book contains a wealth of very important information. If you are reading the reviews and just thinking about it - just buy it! This book has totally changed my outlook on my health, my diet, and I feel 100% better.<br /><br />My own story: I have always known I was something of a \\"carbs addict\\" - I jokingly used to call myself the \\"Carbs Queen\\" because I could happily eat not just one but 2 huge bowls of \\"healthy whole grain\\" breakfast cereal to start my day...I would get home from school or work and load up on more of the same as my \\"afternoon snack\\".  I have always loved Italian food (even though I am not Italian) - pasta, foccaccia, pizza....all that gluten!<br /><br />Roll forward to a few months ago: 2 kids (their births took a toll physically), have thyroid issues, fatigue, can't sleep well, chronic constipation and bloating, minor weight gain which I just put down to 2 births and nearing 40, mind constantly fuzzy, terrible memory, prone to depression and low self esteem, cyst in breast, polyp in cervix, terrible hair loss for no apparent reason...I was feeling like crap, basically.<br /><br />And rolling forward to now: I have cut out gluten completely, and I will NEVER go back to it. I tested negative for Celiac, but I am definitely somewhere on that spectrum, and I believe my kids may be too. I will be working on their diets over the next 6 months too.<br />I feel like a new person, about 20 years younger. I am losing weight around my middle, and while that wasn't my goal, I love it - feel great about myself. I have also started taking Lugol's Iodine for my thyroid issues and that is fabulous - read the reviews on that and see the incredible comments from many happy customers.<br /><br />Wheat is awful stuff...whatever has been done to it in the past 50 years has basically rendered it a poison to people like me. I may not be Celiac, but wheat is still a poison - it was slowly killing me, and coupled with my poor thyroid having issues it was starting to speed up the process.<br /><br />Read this book! You won't regret it.speed up the process.<br /><br />Read this book! You won't regret it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is AMAZING!!!!  It is sooooo addicting. I play it ALL the time. There isn't much to do. And you have to be careful not to touch the screen when you don't want to jump,  slide,  or any of the other actions.
B008EDGBW6|2.0|After months of delays and anticipation, Chris Brown's highly anticipated 5th studio album and follow up to the Grammy award winning F.A.M.E. has finally arrived. Fortune's release is just after Brown's two biggest rivals, Usher and R. Kelly, dropped albums of their own, both receiving praise from critics. With all this said, Fortune gives Brown a chance to establish himself as the King of R&B and even the next Michael Jackson. Unfortunately, Fortune fails to do this.<br /><br />Turn Up the Music - The first single from the album is well produced and is a great club banger. Brown's vocals are great and the song brings great energy and anticipation to the album. 9/10<br /><br />Bassline - Wow. After an exciting intro, you get this stupid song about how girls like Brown's \\"bassline\\". It is a huge miss and seems like something you would throw into a mixtape, not a studio album. 1/10<br /><br />Till I Die - Despite cameo's from two of rap's newest stars, Big Sean and Wiz Khalifa, this song is another huge disappointment. Their raps are mediocre and the production is bad. I have respect for all three, but this song really falls flat and is a shell of what it could have been (the next \\"Look at Me Now\\") 4/10<br /><br />Mirage - Brown's vocals are good and the production is much better than the previous songs. However, the song itself is not outstanding. However Nas, one of the greatest Hip-Hop artists ever, throws down a great verse and saves the song. 7.5/10<br /><br />Don't Judge Me - A slow ballad that Brown really excels at. It is reminiscent of Justin Bieber or Drake songs, however is much more polished. You can hear grief and regret in Brown's voice as he tries to get a girl to,well, not judge him. The production is very good and overall the song is a highlight on this album. 7.5/10<br /><br />2012 - This song is a slow sex ballad, one which Brown also excels. Very similar to FAME's \\"No BS\\". 8/10<br /><br />Biggest Fan - Another great song that fits well with the previous two and is very similar. Brown's vocals are very good and the production is great. Reminds me of \\"No BS\\" as well as \\"Superstar\\" by Usher. 9/10<br /><br />Sweet Love - This song had a lot of potential, but the production completely kills the song. While it should have a slow and fluid flow, it does the exact opposite. This could have been the highlight of the album, but this production was just terrible and is a huge disappointment. 5/10<br /><br />Strip - Although a little short and unpolished, Strip is a solid song. It's more fun than anything and the hook can be a little infectious. The production is also good and even Kevin McCall's rap isn't that bad. 7/10<br /><br />Stuck on Stupid - An uptempo ballad that proves to another highlight of the album. The production is very good and Brown's vocals are very good. 9/10<br /><br />4 Years Old - Another very good slow ballad. Brown's vocals are at their best and the production is also very good. In my opinion it is the best song on the album. 9/10<br /><br />Party Hard / Cadillac (Interlude) - More great vocals and production. The Cadillac part features vocals by Sevyn, which really bring new life into the album. 8/10<br /><br />Don't Wake Me Up - Despite annoying use of auto-tune, this song is still pretty good. The production is very good on this track, even though the song seems a little basic and incomplete. Similar to, but not as good as, Usher's song \\"Euphoria\\". 8.5/10<br /><br />Trumpet Lights - The final song pretty much sums the album up: a combination of good vocals,solid production, and ultimately not memorable. I'm surprised this song made the final cut on the album, since it does not really fit with the rest of the album and the hook is pretty stupid. Not the finale I expected from such a talented artist. 2.5/10<br /><br />Ultimately, Fortune is a huge disappointment and is nowhere near the level of Usher and Kelly's recent releases. I recommend that you NOT buy this album unless you are a huge ChrisBrown fan. We can officially say that Brown is not the next Michael Jackson or King of R&B.
B0086700CM|4.0|Me and my daughter really enjoy this game. we find it to be very addictive and a nice way to pass a little time. we try to see which one of us can collect the most coins and go the longest with out running or hitting something. we both would recommend this game.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green really captured the thoughts of a person living with cancer.  It is artfully written, and tasteful for young adult readers.  It is well worth the price, and will have you laughing out loud, and in tears.  John Green touches the readers emotions. As a part of nerdfighteria, I was anxious to read his novel to see if he was as brilliant on paper as he is when he speaks, and truly he did not disappoint.  This novel is a must read, and I am anxious to read his other works!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its very entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone who would like hours of fun games to play for free.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|As title says, game was good until the update installed.  Unlike most I had the patience to play without spending actual money, otherwise the game is costly to play constantly. Have not yet had trouble with timers resetting to ridiculous lengths. I'm more aggravated with the constant notifications, EVEN AFTER I TURNED THEM ALL OFF. It's foolish to receive notifications WHILE playing the game. I may consider changing my review if this problem is fixed. Until then I would not recommend this game to anyone due to the harassing nature of the notifications.

1597801585|4.0|Wind Up Girl isn't a perfect science fiction novel but it is a very good one and I strongly recomend it. Wind Up's strongest element is the world it breathes to life. It's a world simultaneously without oil and afflicted by \\"gene hacking\\" which has turned many mundane crops into ineddible slime as crop diseases are a security threat.<br /><br />Against that backdrop a story like the movie version of Blade Runner plays out in Thailand.<br /><br />I've seen parts of it before in other places ... but its well executed and I found the characters compelling. If you haven't read this yet you are missing a good thought provoking tale.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Cant wait for the sequel. I didn't have high expectations going in, so they were surprisingly exceeded.  Could not put the book down. Parts are cheesy, but something about the story keeps you craving more.
B007R41E8O|2.0|First off: yes, the download for this game takes a pretty long time. It IS a large game, and is very graphics-intensive, so if you're planning on playing this on your Fire, you're probably not going to be able to play any other games or watch movies in the meantime.<br /><br />The graphics are amazing, the premise is intriguing, the music is perfectly creepy, and the puzzles are challenging. So why only two stars? (Beware, here there be spoilers.)<br /><br />1.) A hefty portion of the game is spent looking for what I started thinking of as \\"plot coupons.\\" You have to find 13 little snake thingies and 3 keys for one door and two halves of a couple of other keys and 5 fuses, etc. etc. A LOT of time is spent running back and forth from one location to the next looking for the next \\"coupon.\\" After a few hours of this, I was hitting the \\"hint' button constantly just to keep moving.<br /><br />2.) I can't imagine trying to play this game without the \\"hint\\" button. I love puzzle games and hidden object games, and for me it's usually a point of pride not to need hints, but in this case certain objects or puzzles were darn near impossible without a little help from the game. I don't think it's because the game is especially hard. It just doesn't give you a lot of information to work with. During the underwater section, you're sent off for additional parts two or three times. Nothing in the game narration tells you what you need. It just keeps telling you that [whatever] won't work until you have the right parts. After a certain amount of searching nearby, I just started hitting \\"hint.\\" It sent me across the island, referred me to a spot where there were no obvious action items, showed me what I needed, and then told me I needed something ELSE to retrieve that object. If this kind of thing happened once or twice it would be challenging, but instead it was basically the whole game.<br /><br />3.) There were a few inventory fakeouts (something that I really hate in games). I had to pick up a few objects, watch a few irrelevant cutscenes, and then carry these objects around for the rest of the game for no reason. Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but in most adventure-type games it's implied that if you pick something up, it will eventually be of use.<br /><br />4.) Some of the puzzles were repeats of other Alawar games (or those games are repeats of this one. Don't know, don't care). I had just played Snark Busters a week earlier, and a few of the puzzles are friggin' identical. Come on, guys, you can do better than that!<br /><br />5.) The game starts out with a facinating storyline - our hero has just been stranded on a mysterious island, his girlfriend was kidnapped, and there are some very strange footprints and weird snake sculptures everywhere. There's a cuise ship that's run aground, and it looks like something tore its way out of the hull from the inside. Elsewhere, we see old newspapers discussing the mysterious disappearances of a number of people over the last 90 years. A church has been demolished, and we find the remains of a woman bricked into her bedroom. Her journal tells us that she was pregnant, and that her husband was one of the missing. Interesting, right? Too bad none of it matters in the end. I would say that the ending is a twist, but really, it's just incredibly random and raises more questions.<br /><br />In conclusion: this game is like LOST, but if LOST had been canceled after season 2. Nothing is answered, and I felt like I had wasted my time by playing.d to pick up a few objects, watch a few irrelevant cutscenes, and then carry these objects around for the rest of the game for no reason.

0790729652|4.0|I haven't yet reviewed this movie and I feel obligated that I must. I'm not going just by nostalgia here. Nolan's films ARE better. To each his own, but to deny that, you're in denial or you prefer a bit more simple, fantastical Batman. I've always been a Batman fan from childhood up. While Nolan's are better, this movie right here still belongs in my Batman movie collection more than the other live interpretations from the past. I'll always remember fondly all the hype and hoopla for the first serious, big budget take of my favorite superhero. And yes, he is a superhero. People keep trying to claim he isn't because he has no powers. Excuse me but after Superman I believe he was the second superhero created. I don't know why all of a sudden people are trying to change that fact. A superhero doesn't have to have powers. Anyway, back to this. This movie was awesome and still is. Great action, good performances and I must say it's still iconic today. I was 13 when this came out and I remember begging my dad to see it. When he finally took me and my brother to see it, I enjoyed every second. It was sealed forever in my mind. The Batman I read in comics had been done right. Perfectly? No. Batman doesn't kill. But it was all I had then and it ruled for years, Batman wise, until Batman Begins. Nolan's trilogy is my definitive live action Batman but 1989 Batman still gets high praise with them. I remember I'd watch it on VHS so much, my dad got irritated. But I didn't give a crap. Lol. At least I wasn't doing anything destructive. All in all, I put this with my awesome Batman DVDS like Batman TAS, The Batman, Under the Red Hood and the Nolan/Bale films. If you haven't seen it, see it. :)
0670022411|5.0|I got both the paper version ad the book on tape. The paper version was HUGE--- but as a book on tape it is amazing.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I actually read this book before the mass popularity. I read the whole triology TWICE within 2 weeks.... ENOUGH said.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The only thing I can think is that the masses who are enjoying this simply have nothing to compare it to, neither in terms of quality erotica, nor quality sexual experience. As many have noted, the writing can best be described as juvenile, and given I grew up in that area of Washington, the geography and vernacular are both definitely off. Don't waste your time or your money. The author was clearly trying to write something that she thought would appeal to Americans, by using such cliche language and trying to \\"shock\\" us with all of the illicit activities. What's really sad is that apparently she succeeded.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|Sort of The Tommyknockers meets the Covenant. Not great but not bad, it kept me entertained the whole time but I probably wouldn't want to see it again. I am glad I rented it before buying.
0451197879|5.0|When I started reading this book as a Stephen King novel, I was kind of bored and disappointed; well, actually, as a Richard Bachman novel--and trust me, if you're an experience Stephen King reader, then you'll know the difference between King and Bachman. In terms of taste, it would be the difference between chocolate (King) and Frank's RedHot sauce (Bachman)--and that is quite the perfect analogy in the sense that most people enjoy chocolate, but Frank's RedHot sauce . . . well, let's just say you need a required taste. Bachman--unlike King--is a bitter, unpleasant author that really has no love for his reader. That's okay, because it is sort of an act. In The Long Walk, it was about a bunch of kids being killed by a big brother society, in which if they stopped walking or went below a certain speed, they would be shot dead. What is enjoyable about that?<br /><br />And likewise, with Roadwork, what's enjoyable about a man named Burt that lost his job, his wife, his home, and ultimately his sanity and his will to live. Roadwork is essentially the journey of his unraveling. Really, the story isn't that sophisticated. But please--for Pete's sake--don't expect paranormal activity around every corner, because Bachman is not the same person as King (they are physically, but not in their literature). Bachman, in a way, is like Eli Roth (the director who made Cabin Fever and Hostel Part I and II), in the sense that it's all about the displeasure of the character and the audience.<br /><br />If you compare this to The Long Walk, you'll still be kind of disappointed by the slowness of this novel. But, remember, by default The Long Walk's premise promises more \\"action.\\" If Roadwork had lots of action, it would be there just for the sake of it. And King is usually good at knowing when to pick up the pace (or should I say Bachman?).<br /><br />If you read this novel and keep AMC's Breaking Bad in the back of your mind, I think you'll enjoy this book a lot.  Even the premise is similar to Breaking Bad. If I were to have given this novel a score the first hundred pages in, I would have given it a 3/5. But, at the halfway point, I started to understand the style and the tone, and that's what makes this book so endearing. I highly recommend it to a patient reader or a Breaking Bad fan.<br /><br />And remember, when Stephen King wrote Roadwork, he never intended on people knowing it was really him; with that being said, it's the furthest thing from a King novel. It's complete freedom for an author to do what they want, without restraints.similar to Breaking Bad.

B0083GPDBO|4.0|I liked this movie more than I thought that I would. I wanted to see it, but I wasn't sure because of the \\"home video\\" type of filming that it used. I am getting kind of tired of movies that use it, but I decided to give it a try and rent it anyway. I liked the movie because it was different and it kept my interest. I liked the characters and the story line. If you are unsure about it, I think that you should give it a try .

B007R12TNQ|3.0|I think that the chipmunks are adorable and always enjoy their movies. Obviously, it's not the best movie ever, but kids and adults can enjoy it. I like watching movies like this when I just want to relax and I want a cute, fun movie. Plus, this movie is only 99 cents right now and you really can't beat that!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Every other reviewer has said it great so far.  Hugh you've done a magnificent job at telling a dystopic tale on par with Lois Lowry and the like.  Even when I thought the key would be a Matrix like plot twist you did a great job at maintaining mystery and not getting too far ahead of what the characters know.  Compelling story, excellent writing and should definitely not be as cheap as it is, but I'm thankful it is for now.<br /><br />You, scifi reader, forget Mockingjay cause it's an awful ending and read this instead.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|I'm sorry, but this movie is a perfect example of how movies these days are so tainted by in-your-face vulgarity that the producers shoot themselves in the foot.  My kids and I loved the original 21 Jump Street but I would go to great lengths to keep them from ever watching this piece of trash that could have been so funny.  Seriously, how many references to \\"sucking d***\\" and anal sex can you put into the first hour of a movie?  If you're not sure, either view a porno movie or rent this piece of garbage.  I was looking forward to watching this movie and saw how great it could have been (some parts had me laughing hysterically).  But, alas, I had to turn it off about halfway. Another potential classic ruined.  IMO, they could have even made this a G or PG and it would have been just as funny.  Double, triple BOOOOOOOOOO.

B000003N7K|5.0|I was lucky enough to interview Mrs. Tedi Hartman (Johnny's widow) for [[ASIN:0810882817 The Last Balladeer: The Johnny Hartman Story (Studies in Jazz)]]. When I mentioned his recordings were often used as a mood-setter she shared how Johnny once said that if he could have earned a royalty everytime a man used one of his records to get lucky with a lady, he would have made more money than he did from record sales.<br /><br />These exceptional musicans came together for a three-hour session and made this timeless album of romantic ballads. Unlike is often reported, the tracks were not all \\"first takes\\" but they approach a level of perfection hard to fathom considering the songs were captured in an era when recordings consisted of complete live takes with no autotune post-production. Except for some extra reverb, what you hear on the album is just what was recorded live to tape.<br /><br />Coltrane and Hartman had not played together before preparing for this session and they never saw each other again (Coltrane passed away only four years later). But for one afternoon they fused together a beautiful artistic creation. Some have lamented the brevity of the album but I choose to celebrate the fact that during the thirty-two minutes it takes to hear these six tracks, any desparate,clinging hope for romance is possible, and with any luck at all, I will owe Johnny a royalty.<br />~Gregg Akkerman
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Fun for awhile and then got a little strange and lost interest.  Loved the part when she talked about SNL and people on 30 rock.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|alright, I found it a great game to pass time and have fun with!<br />most of the games are easy, but there are really hardones that are almost impossible to pass!<br />I personally found the first one hard.<br />I really liked the game overall because its a really good toke passer
B00881VLCE|5.0|very good app easy to use and has some really great puzzles also lots of free or nearly free downloadable puzzles
B007B6VOG0|2.0|There's' nothing inherently wrong with this album. I bought it for 1.99 because I liked \\"We are Young\\". I didn't really care for the album at all and found it to be way too \\"pop\\" for my tastes and thought it would be a little more \\"rock\\" than it was. The autotune in some songs was a big turn off (i thought the music industry had moved past this phase?).<br /><br />As with any music, this review is based on my opinion. I'm not saying it's bad music for everyone, but just that it wasn't for me.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good game ...no issues with bugs...fun solitaire game. A good way to waste time; like any of us need that!

0345803485|5.0|I read all three books by E.L. James and found all three books amazing! I know people won't understand but when you really get into the books and start to figure that \\"Christian\\" is still a little boy in so many ways of not understanding what Love really is, and \\"Ana\\" is the perfect woman for him in so many ways, despite how he was brought into this world, their relationship starts twisted and unbelievable off. I think all three books are written very well and gives you this idea of opening your immagination to what \\"Christian\\" looks like and what his life is like and you can really feel his odd level of love for \\"Ana\\" as they develop and she gives him a sense of internal peace that he's been looking for with out really knowing.  I am awe of these two main characters and their levels of odd commitment.  I know some will look at this and think I am totally off my rocker, but if you really open your mind and look at each character as three dimentional versus someone that is just a story and one dimentional.  These books are AMAZING!!! I totally recommend this book to everyone!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it is a challenging game that teaches basic hand eye coordination and shows how to save money so you can get th thing that you want by yourself.
B0086700CM|5.0|Best, most time-consuming game that I have ever attempted to play. I spend loads of time working on this very addicting app. Temple Run is definitely the best free app that I have ever gotten. I find myself staring at my kindle every time I can, getting ready to play this game and I would recommend it to anyone.

B00846REIS|5.0|After reading both the Trilogy of Fifty Shades and this book Bared to You. I think they do resemble some of the same things but are still their own story line. I found Sylvia Days writing style was easier to follow and relate to. There were no typos and if there was, I notice. The terms she used for things were set for America (as if an American actually would say something like that). I love the English language as well but then again Fifty was based out of America too with a lot of English terms for things. But either way, I loved both of the books. I can not wait for the 2nd book to come out, so I can know what happens to this HIGHLY dysfuntional couple.<br /><br />Also, I love how she wrote about come dropping out of her and onto the floor...because we women know that come just doesn't stay in there with ease like most books make it seem!
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|This film is visually jaw-dropping on a big screen. I would go so far as to say that this movie looked better at the theater than anything I have seen in years. We have a sizable home theater, but I am glad I did not wait for the video release. A friend strongly recommended seeing it in 3D. Having seen it in that format, I disagree. Some of the scenes are very dark. While the 3D is done pretty well, I do not think you necessarily have to see it in 3D - in fact I think it gave some of the very dark scenes a muddied appearance. I do not yet own the 3D blu-ray, so I cannot comment on how the darkest scenes translate to home systems.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint this film is Ridley Scott on steroids. It is shot very well. The cinematography, editing, effects, acting, sounds and action sequences are all done extremely well. There are a couple of action sequences in particular that are just relentless and leave you feeling drained. This is the type of film that sucks you in and doesn't let you catch your breath. I'm not even a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, but I could easily watch this again.<br /><br />If Amazon allowed half-stars, I would probably give this film four and a half stars instead of four. It isn't a perfect five star film. There is a tremendous amount of violence and some of it is very gory - bordering on gratuitous in a place or two. While I wasn't especially bothered, the person next to me hated it for that very reason. The storyline does have a few weak points, but nothing too serious. Also, I thought the ending was OK, but not as believable as it could have been. Again, none of these things mattered a great deal to me, I was very impressed with this movie. The biggest drawback for me personally was experiencing some of the excessively dark scenes in 3D - I would probably watch the 2D version if I had it to do over. I actually caught myself removing the glasses a couple of times, but of course that will just make things worse when watching 3D formatting.<br /><br />It is not for the squeamish, but if you enjoy good science fiction - it really doesn't get much better than Prometheus.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I have been a RUSH fan since my teen years in the 80's.  While always a huge fan I'd be lying if I said the albums of the last several years have been up to RUSH standards - several great songs but no great RUSH albums.  For me a great RUSH album is one that I can not wait to listen to over and over again, loving every song.  Clockwork Angels is just that.  Its their best offering since Signals.  Every single song on this album is a home run and the lyrics are some of Neil's best.  This album is a true masterpiece and deserves consideration for album of the year - they just don't make them like this anymore.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Due to security concerns, I normally don't use this from public hot spots but it is a great solution for remote desktop into my HTPC from within my home network. Controls on my tablet are in intuitive and the &quot;mouse&quot; function is really nice.
B005HP2J66|5.0|I cannot speak to any 3-D issue, since that is not the version I purchased, but to answer some of the charges by other reviewers:  this film is not repetitive:  only 2 or 3 of the most exquisite painting segments are shown twice but the second times are in silent close-up, wherein you see much greater detail and their artistic value is underscored.  The narration imparts pretty essential data.  The music sometimes seems ancient, sometimes religious, and is rarely if ever intrusive.  And the albino alligator so often cited as a non-sequitur element is actually very appropriate:  to wonder what this mutant, imported denizen of the expanding nearby nuclear facility would think about its own situation, as opposed to the obvious respect and admiration with which Chauvet's artists viewed the other animals in their ecosystem, is sadly entirely relevant.  Altogether, this is an invaluable exploration of our most ancestral culture and values, and a treasured film that I look forward to viewing repeatedly!  If you have an informed interest in this subject matter, you definitely won't go wrong with \\"Cave of Forgotten Dreams.\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a really a good story and it is classically good science fiction.  Before I had read two pages I knew it was going to deserve the solid five star rating.

0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is the first and only book thus far I have read by Paula Coelho.  It is a tale that captures the reality of every human being's experience in this life and how we all make our own conscious decisions whether it be to just survive, simply live, or going forth whole heartedly with our Personal Legend.  We all fall into different categories of how we choose to live our lives and how every situations, encounter, place, and experience takes us their based on our belief and faith in ourselves and the universe.  A must read for everyone no matter you personal legend and even if you have simply decided to just survive, you must read The Alchemist.<br />My son will be going into the second grade next fall and I will purchase the audio book for him.<br />Enjoy.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The 5 stars is for the entire trilogy<br /><br />I'm so glad I didn't check the reviews here as I often do or I may have missed out on a fantastic escape!  50 is erotica, but it is so, so, so much more.  I cannot rate this as book one, it just won't work for me.  I myself know so many people that raved about this story, in it's entirety that I decided to just give it a go.  Is it erotica? You bet.  Does it contain some darkness?  Yep.  As some pointed out there may even be some repitition here and there.  Did any of that bother me?  NO, not one bit.  I was totally consumed by this story.  I initially had some reservations regarding the nature of the erotica.  I don't mind erotica, and a little kink and bondage wouldn't turn me off.  But, the idea of S&M is a bit too much for me, so I was concerned that I wouldn't really get into these books.  I was wrong.  I got right into them alright, so into them I stayed up past my bedtime more than one night.  Erotica can be poorly written and often contains very little story and a lot of smut.  This is not the case.  Hot, smutty goodness there is, but it was the story that kept my rapt attention.  I won't go into a heavy description, there are plenty here.  My bottom line is this is a very addicting story that sucks you in, hook, line, and sinker, and doesn't let go.  You do venture into some darkness here, but it's a journey to a lighter side, with touching moments, humor, and lively character you grow to love.<br /><br />I'd like to thank E.L. James for hours of enjoyment, and I truly hope some new project is in the works.<br /><br />I'll bet Ben & Jerrys would like to thank her too &lt;eg><br /><br />Laters =)
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is my first fixed blade knife; and I absolutely love it. I have had many folding knives before but none could compare to this. I got this knife as a present from my father; and he will never hear the end of my thanks.  This knife was so sharp out of the box I actually cut myself when pulling it out of the sheath. I highly recommend this knife to every one as a knife for camping or field craft.
1400069289|5.0|We all have habits. Most of them we are not even aware of. This book analysis the habits people have.<br />A habit is gained by past experience that the brain gained that follows a constant sequence: cue --> routine --> reward.<br />The book goes through various changes people and firms have done to change people behavior by changing their habits.<br />- how a person stopped chewing her fingernails<br />- how a couch changed the football team<br />- how a manager changed his firm<br />- how Starbucks changed their workers<br /><br />It also showed how firms take advantage of the habits we have to gain more customers. (Target identified pregnant women in order to send them coupons before they gave birth. This is after it recognized that after birth people change their buying habits, and wanted them to do it in Target.)<br /><br />This is a well written book with a lot of examples of what habits are and how to use them for making change.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|THIS IS A REALLY COOL MOVIE!  If this movie would have had the kind of publicity given to the new Spiderman movie (Really?  We need a remake of Sam Raimi's Spiderman?) and had the pompous movie critics not blasted it I believe this would have killed at the box office.  It has everything:  Civil War, 1800's Archeology, Aliens, Sword Fighting, a hot Martian Princess...Come on!<br /><br />I think they do Edgar Rice Burroughs proud.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|The problem is the writing and the director. I should say the \\"re-writing\\".  I agree with the comment that there are some Disney executives who should be in the unemployment line.  How do you take a GREAT series of books, then ruin the movie experience?<br />1. Wrong Cast<br />2. Wrong Director<br />3. Try to re-write the story
1451648537|5.0|As this book reflects the life of Steve Jobs it was hard to answer the question what kind of person he really was. In some ways he reminded me of dictators which build beautiful monuments left for other to inspire years later. On other ways I was envy of his capability to foresee the future needs for people around the world. If it is the apple computer, the mac, the Pixar movies, the iPod, iPhone, iPad etc'<br /><br />He seemed to be a person to be followed and a SOB at the same time. I tried to imagine how it was to work with him, and didn't find the answer. In some places he is a person which would demand to do the things that reached your limit you never imagine you have. He was a person that could convince anyone to do things they couldn't believe they can even do it. On contrary there were other times it was better not to be around him. So the question had a yes/no answer but not a conclusion.<br /><br />I believe apple \\"think different\\" commercial say it all: \\"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify and vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as crazy, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.\\"<br /><br />Very recommended book of a person who thought different.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I'm super addicted! It reminds me of when I used to play Mario as a kid for hours at a time ahaha. I really enjoy this game. It's simple but entertaining.
0307744434|1.0|I, too, fell for the hype. I am finally, finally close to the end and only kept reading because I had wasted so much time on this boring, childishly written tome that I wouldn't let myself give up. Should have stopped after the first few painful chapters. All the way through I kept going back to the cover, sure that there must be fine type somewhere saying: \\"Young Adult Fiction\\" or \\"Teen Romance Novel.\\" Although the word \\"romance\\" would be a complete overstatement. The writing itself is embarrassingly childlike, and there is not a hint of suspense, tension or anything else. Even the deaths are completely devoid of emotion, and the characters are as flat as the paper from which Marco builds this supposedly magical circus. Definitely not recommended for adults, although ages 5 to about 10 might enjoy.

0385512066|5.0|Amazing book of how to do business by finding and communicating with people.<br />There are some times when you see someone that looks nuts but you are envious of what he is dong. This is actually what the author is doing. He has 7000 people in his phone book, and knows exactly how to keep in touch with all of them.<br />This guy simply knows how to contact people help them and get their help.<br />In this book he gives his advice on how to do exactly as he does.<br />A year after reading this book it is still a lighthouse for me.<br />Very recommended, a book that changes the perspective of life.

B004SIP9E2|5.0|It isn't often that a movie mines a vein of obvious jokes and makes them hilarious. \\"Scary Movie's charm is that it mines the horror genre - not usually a place for laughs, and relentlessly pokes fun at the genre's absurdities and silly, stock characters. There's the school beauty, played by Carmen Electra, who finds herself pursued by a knife wielding maniac while home alone at night. Of course, the house is made almost completely of glass, making her ludicrously visible to the attacker lurking outside. When she escapes the killer, she encounters two signs pointing in opposite directions -- \\"Safety\\" and \\"Death.\\" You don't have to be Houdini to know which direction she picks.<br /><br />But there's lots more! The film takes another of the genre's tropes - the virgin couple desperate to get it on - and runs with it. There is no way to discuss the hilarity, but it involves an electrified chastity belt, barbed wire, safety goggles, a chain saw and a geyser of...well, watch the film! There are jokes on pot-smoking, breast implants, gay panic, guilt over past misdeeds, the Matrix and much more. Not being a big horror fan, I was worried that I wouldn't get the references to horror films. But I needn't have worried. The film is terrifically funny, even if you are only vaguely familiar with the genre's standard themes. For a \\"dumb\\" movie, the acting was first rate. Kudos especially to Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell, the cute virgin girl, who has a intelligently comic face and great timing.<br /><br />\\"Scary Movie,\\" the first installment in what has become an industry, has the purity and the fearlessness that comes from filmmakers just going for it. Not knowing whether there would be sequels, they make a film that is as funny as it can be made. A fabulous effort, with many memorable moments, even if my wife wouldn't join me to watch it!
B008397A4O|4.0|After a tour of Zappos I received a copy of this book. I am a huge fan of Zappos and their culture, even though their particular culture can't be applied to every work environment pieces of it most certainly can.  An outside consultant asked that our Executive Team read this book as prework to a potential cultural redefinement. While Tony Hshieh is without a doubt highly intelligent and self motivated (to do as much as he can with as little effort as possible), the first 125 pages struct me as self-indulgent stories of 'this is my life' and partying.  However the last half of the book is impressive in its information \\"don't outsource your core competiencies,\\" \\"empower your employees to Wow your customers (after, of course, defining WOW service),\\" and their whole method of hiring, firing, and training staff based on their culture.  I would recommend this book (and the audio version), but take the first half with a grain of salt.
B004A5EWZK|3.0|These episodes are complete, containing scenes not shown on BBC America. Historical consequences continue to ripple from the hefty rocks launched by King Henry VIII, affecting the world today. The Tudor period is interesting, even without embellishment. \\"The Tudors\\" indulges in mixing fascinating truth with historical fiction, so you may enjoy verifying the facts after viewing. The sets and costumes are visually rich, a nice escape from contemporary sparseness.<br /><br />The U.K. abounds with burly redheaded men (and actors) whose visages perfectly mimic that of King Henry VIII, they're as common as the hearty meat pies they resemble. We're quite familiar with what Henry VIII actually looked like. Poor little Jonathan Rhys Myers would be lost inside King Henry VIII's armor; what woeful miscasting. And in the opening scene with Henry administering pressure to his personal needs, Showtime shlock is demanded of Meyers and inflicted on viewers. The obligatory multitude of heaving bosoms is repetitive; the fine actors and audience deserve better. In the last Season, young Myers is crudely \\"aged.\\" This isn't the actor's fault, but the director's, whose idea of an older Henry VIII has Meyers jutting his chin like an ersatz Orson Welles, grumbling, \\"You shall have no wine before it's time.\\" Sadly, Meyers subsequently has been plagued by excesses of alcohol. Sam Waddington, the excellent actor who portrays Edward Stafford (an ancestor of my spouse, so I'm biased), the 3rd Duke of Buckingham, would have been a much more appropriate choice, though perhaps he wouldn't have submitted to Showtime's Henry-sleazy. Waddington is from the same area once dominated by the Plantagenet House of York. Unlike the story in \\"The Tudors,\\" the first conflict between the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and King Henry VIII regarded Henry's seduction of the Duke's sister, Anne Stafford, a conflict not explored in the series.<br /><br />The tragic Anne Boleyn, mother of Queen Elizabeth I, is masterfully played by Natalie Dormer, who shines in the role. There are stories behind stories with \\"The Tudors.\\" Unfortunately, the creators of this series weren't particularly interested in depicting accurate events. Lady Margaret Pole (poorly depicted in \\"The Tudors\\") was persecuted by Henry VIII, her son in-law, the 1st Barron Stafford, was the son of the executed Edward Stafford, the 3rd Duke of Buckingham (Waddington). Stafford's mother was the daughter of the 4th Earl of Northumberland. Her nephew, Henry Percy, was said to have had an unfortunate secret marriage to Anne Boleyn. Later, he was forced to marry another woman, and was present at Anne's \\"trial,\\" after which he collapsed; dying a few months later.  Henry's hapless fifth wife, Katherine Howard (well-played by Tazmin Merchant), was Anne's first-cousin, the niece of Anne's mother (Katherine's father and Anne's mother were siblings). Henry couldn't leave the Howards alone. The depiction of the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk, Katherine's step-grandmother, who raised her, is oddly scewed.<br /><br />The worse Henry VIII's chance of providing legitimate male successors became, the more he pruned branches of the Plantagenet tree with more authentic claims to the throne than himself. Countess Salisbury, Lady Margaret Pole, was a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon, and governess to Princess Mary. Margaret's family was viciously persecuted by Henry VIII because they had many direct lines to the throne. Later, her son, Cardinal Reginald Pole, was the last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury. Her daughter, Ursula (1504-1570), married Henry Stafford, the 1st Barron Stafford. His father (played by Sam Waddington) Edward Stafford, the 3rd Duke of Buckingham, is depicted with historical inaccuracies in the first episodes of \\"The Tudors.\\" Buckingham was the great-great grandson of Edward the III. He had royal blood through Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Buckingham, younger son of Edward III, and brother of John ofGaunt; his mother, Catherine Woodville, was sister to Edward IV's queen, the lovely Elizabeth Woodville. These two sisters were descended from the de Luxembourg rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, and noble Orsini and de Balzo families.<br /><br />Lady Salisbury (Pole) was the eldest daughter of the George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, and the former Isabella Neville, elder daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and Anne Beauchamp, his wife, who inherited the Earldom of Warwick. George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, 1st Earl of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Warwick, (1449 - 1478) was the third son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville. He was the brother of King Edward IV and King Richard III. His wife, Isabella, was the sister of Queen Anne, wife of King Richard III. George's mother, Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, was the daughter of Sir Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, a Plantagenet, the 3rd surviving son of Edward the III, and father of Henry IV. These families were all interwoven.<br /><br />The arrest and brutal execution (considered grotesque even by that society's bloodthirsty standards) of Lady Margaret Pole (1473-1541) in \\"The Tudors\\" depicts her as cowardly. The historical record indicates her brave defiance and devout faith. For some reason, the show's writers transferred her execution onto Thomas Cromwell, perhaps to make him appear the larger martyr. Lady Salisbury was married to Sir Richard Pole (his mother, Edith St. John, was the half sister of King Henry VII's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort). Her grandfather was Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the \\"Kingmaker,\\" the wealthiest and most powerful English peer of his age, with international political connections, a main protagonist in the Wars of the Roses. The elder of his two daughters, Isabel, married George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (daughter, Margaret Pole). Neville's younger daughter, Queen Anne, after a short-lived marriage to King Henry VI's son Edward of Westminster (who died young), married King Edward's younger brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who later became King Richard III. Anne was originally betrothed to Richard; he rescued her from captivity as George's ward. George wanted her massive inheritance in addition to her sister's.<br /><br />The depiction of the Catholic uprising, the [[ASIN:1842126660 Pilgrimage of Grace: The Rebellion That Shook Henry VIII's Throne]], has a bare minimum of detail; the Percy, Neville, and even Stafford families were deeply involved. This was a conflict between relatives about religious beliefs and power, whose outcome was fundamental to England; it would define who sat on the throne, a Tudor, or a Yorkist Plantagenet. Henry VIII, for all his foibles, sat triumphant in his sphere of assumed spiritual and political authority, largely due to all the family in-fighting  dating back to [[ASIN:B004XC5LQE The Wars of the Roses: A Bloody Crown]].Gaunt; his mother, Catherine Woodville, was sister to Edward IV's queen, the lovely Elizabeth Woodville. These two sisters were descended from the de Luxembourg rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, and noble Orsini and de Balzo families.<br /><br />Lady Salisbury (Pole) was the eldest daughter of the George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, and the former Isabella Neville, elder daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and Anne Beauchamp, his wife, who inherited the Earldom of Warwick.

These families were all interwoven.<br /><br />The arrest and brutal execution (considered grotesque even by that society's bloodthirsty standards) of Lady Margaret Pole (1473-1541) in \\"The Tudors\\" depicts her as cowardly. The historical record indicates her brave defiance and devout faith. For some reason, the show's writers transferred her execution onto Thomas Cromwell, perhaps to make him appear the larger martyr. Lady Salisbury was married to Sir Richard Pole (his mother, Edith St. John, was the half sister of King Henry VII's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort). Her grandfather was Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the \\"Kingmaker,\\" the wealthiest and most powerful English peer of his age, with international political connections, a main protagonist in the Wars of the Roses. The elder of his two daughters, Isabel, married George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (daughter, Margaret Pole). Neville's younger daughter, Queen Anne, after a short-lived marriage to King Henry VI's son Edward of Westminster (who died young), married King Edward's younger brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who later became King Richard III. Anne was originally betrothed to Richard; he rescued her from captivity as George's ward. George wanted her massive inheritance in addition to her sister's.<br /><br />The depiction of the Catholic uprising, the [[ASIN:1842126660 Pilgrimage of Grace: The Rebellion That Shook Henry VIII's Throne]], has a bare minimum of detail; the Percy, Neville, and even Stafford families were deeply involved. This was a conflict between relatives about religious beliefs and power, whose outcome was fundamental to England; it would define who sat on the throne, a Tudor, or a Yorkist Plantagenet. Henry VIII, for all his foibles, sat triumphant in his sphere of assumed spiritual and political authority, largely due to all the family in-fighting  dating back to [[ASIN:B004XC5LQE The Wars of the Roses: A Bloody Crown]].
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Get some headphones and block out some time to listen to this new CD from the Beach Boys in its entirety. A masterpiece from beginning to end IMHO. In the interest of full disclosure, much of this is reminiscent of the Beach Boys' early sound and I am a HUGE fan of that era. It contains all new songs, many of which would have been hits in the 60s and could be today if radio wasn't so locked in to the same old/stale rotation. Check it out for yourself.

0345803485|1.0|I have been blasting this book since I first realized that it could interest anyone, and therefore, damage the integrity of this genre'.  In my opinion,  The only women/people who could find this book in any way appealing are those who have not read a good/excellent erotic novel. The erotic genre' is written for mature readers who prefer mature vocabulary as well as sexual depictions. BDSM or D/s romance novels are a subculture or the erotic genre'. With so many incredible authors and a plethora of outstanding books, it only saddens me that this book will be in any way a standard by which the genre is judged.<br /><br />Hopefully, these readers will move on and find the better books and know that 50 Shades, in no way measures up. I have waited years and years for some of the great erotic authors to take this stage and cause this kinds of frenzy.  I am simply nauseated that a sub-par book at best has upstaged those authors and their books.<br /><br />This author did not do any research into the BDSM world beyond what she herself has read in other better written books, and it shows.  Her style is juvenile, pedestrian, and simply dull. I guess you could really say this book is 50 Shades of Grey, if by that you mean, dull, lifeless, boring, monotonous, drab, dim, muted, faded,lackluster,and insipid. I could go on but that would be repetitive.  Oh,and this book is the definition of repetitive.<br /><br />For those readers that before 50 Shades of Grey, had not read a book of this nature.  I realize that this has opened a whole new world for you.  Explore this world please. In hopes that you will find that this book is not a benchmark or a revelation, and is not \\"the book\\" to represent an entire genre'.  This book is not something new and therefore to be hailed as the beginning of a new form of novels.  If anything this book is a poorly constructed compilation of books that a fan had read and then decided she could do herself.  In my opinion she failed and is duping a lotof people who could do better.<br /><br />If you want to read books with mature language, plots, and graphic sexual depictions that are more realistic and yet still carry that romantic tone. Take the time to check out some of the publisher sites.
1594202842|5.0|This is a memoir, not a how to manual. I found it to be very funny, moving, and informative. I especially recommend it if you are at all interested in cultural differences. Perhaps her parenting style warrants some criticism, but that doesn't mean her book isn't interesting and well-written.
B00138J9HI|5.0|This album came out during my freshmen year of High School. Judas just has it all. The image, the rythym, the blazin lead runs, and they write great heavy metal songs.<br />If you get the chance, see them live before they retire, they're not getting any younger. This album rocks from beginning to end.

0307730697|5.0|I have heard about the book Fearless for a few months now, and even posted earlier that I had read the first chapter of the book, so I was very excited to find that WaterBrook Press was offering the book for review.  I read this book in two sittings, which really would have been one sitting if I didn't plan to get ready for a family reunion at my home over the weekend.  This book is just so good that it was very hard to put it down.  And like really great books, I did go through a few tissues, especially at the end.  I spent about twenty minutes during a drive with my teenagers yesterday excitedly re-telling stories from the book (with them listening wide-eyed).<br /><br />Fearless, written by Eric Blehm, tells the life story of Adam Brown, a man who should go down in history as one of our American heroes. The book tells the good, the bad and the ugly in Adam's life, including a stint with drugs and a stay in prison.  It tells the incredible story of how Adam overcame physical wounds that would have sidelined any other man (including Navy Seals) to advance to the top level, DEVGRU (Naval Special Warfare Development Group), upon which time all records are labeled \\"Top Secret\\".<br /><br />Even though I knew the end of the story, it was still very hard to accept the fact that Adam gave his life for his country.  I wanted him to live on forever.  But as author Eric Blehm points out Adam was a Christian, a man who professed Christ as his Savior, and his life and his witness did not end with his death.<br /><br />Adam's witness at home and in the field affected many people, from the Afghan children he took shoes to during the cold months (over 500 pairs were distributed by Adam, collected from his family, fellow Seals and churches), to the way he engaged in battle.  He helped his wife teach Sunday school.  He brought fellow Seals to church with him.  One Seal struggled with the concept of Christianity, but accepted Christ shortly before he was killed on a mission.  Many lives were changed because of Adam's faith and example.<br /><br />The author makes a statement in his Afterword that speaks volumes to the character of Adam Brown:<br />And though I hadn't opened a Bible in more than twenty-five years, his (Adam Brown's) faith encouraged me to question my own questioning about religion.<br /><br />This is a book you might want to reserve for older, mature teenagers and adults.  Those who can handle the graphic nature of the book, as well as a few choice words sprinkled in, mainly in the beginning of the book.  Overall, this is a book that I will be sharing with my sons, a couple of my nephews and other family members.  I believe it is important that we choose heroes who actually do what is right, those who serve our country and try to make our lives better, and not those who are portrayed as \\"heroes\\" today on television shows.<br /><br />In order to comply with new Federal Trade Commission regulations, please note that this book was provided compliments of  WaterBrook Press.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Not gonna be a wannabe critic here.<br /><br />I enjoy this album. And I am a strange Rush fan who owns all of their albums. Typically, for the last several albums after Presto, I do not like them initially and they take time to grow on me. Some take a very long time.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels is different, I liked it pretty much right away. Of course we had the teaser tracks Caravan and BU2B to break us in. I had no idea about the concept, however I have taken to it quite nicely.<br /><br />Particularly like Carnies (I &lt;3 Alex's riff), Headlong Flight, Wish Them Well, and The Garden. As usual with Rush fans, I find the messages on this album are easy to apply to my situations and help me deal with my daily grind. Having recently lost a lot of weight, and making like changes for the better, this album rocks. Also we all seem to have a Doug & Wendy whiner in our lives, and all that we can do is \\"Wish Them Well.\\"<br /><br />In this era of mp3 players, and crappy earphones, this album stands out sonically when listened to with proper audio equipment. Big nice speakers, or quality reference headphones. Just as with Rush' 1st Album - For Best Results - Listen at maximum volume.<br /><br />/Cheers, JP
0307887448|3.0|I wanted to like this book, and for a while I actually loved.  But despite a bunch of cool ideas, \\"Ready Player One\\" doesn't seem to know what kind of book it wants to be, or what audience it's trying to reach.<br /><br />In the not-too-distant future of \\"Ready Player One\\", unemployment is soaring, millions of Americans work in indentured servitude to pay their debts, and natural resources are being depleted at a dizzying rate.  To escape the problems of real life, most people spend as much time as possible within the virtual reality world of the Oasis.  As the novel opens, the game's creator dies and announces in a video will that he has hidden a quest within the game, and the first to complete it will inherit his entire fortune.  This of course sets everyman players like orphaned teenager Wade into furious--and deadly--competition with a large (and of course evil) corporation.<br /><br />What the novel does well, it does extremely well: in the world of \\"Ready Player One\\", urban sprawl has resulted in an epidemic shortage of housing, the remedy to which has been to erect skyscraper trailer parks: beaten down double-wides stacked on top of each other, reaching hundreds of feet into the sky, swaying dangerously with the wind and very regularly collapsing; it's an image hauntingly rendered, and is a refreshingly original addition to the tropes of dystopian fiction.  \\"Ready Player One\\" has several nice details like this, all making the novel's world engaging and believable, and the characters who inhabit it sympathetic.<br /><br />But at around the midway point, it all starts to fall apart.  The novel's best quality--it's depiction of a bleak American future--is pushed to the background in favor of its worst aspects.  The creator of the Oasis was obsessed with the 1980s, and so the world of the game (and, in turn, the novel) is littered with over-detailed representations of pop culture from that decade.  At first this is kind of fun for the reader--discussions of forgotten classic arcade games and science fiction movies are fun for fans of the time period--but it gets tired, around the time several pages are dedicated to a detailed (and I mean very detailed) description of the '80s movie \\"Wargames\\".  And it doesn't get any more enjoyable when, later on, \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" is given the same treatment.  The cumulative effect of these and other '80s references is to make the reader say, \\"Great, Mr. author, you know who holds the world's high score on Donkey Kong.  So what?\\"  To be blunt, the novel gets boring, right around the time it should be at its most compelling.<br /><br />There are myriad other problems, as well: characters have a habit of suddenly sounding like television PSAs when they regularly begin preaching about environmental concerns.  It's a message that I philosophically agree with, but I don't need to hear about global warming and oil over-consumption in my video game novels.  And a love story between protagonist Wade and a rival player that would be more at home in a YA book consumes the whole plot by the novel's conclusion.<br /><br />To run the risk of sounding flippant, for those readers who are obsessed with both online gaming and '80s pop culture, this may be the best book you read all year.  For everyone else, it's more of an experience of \\"what could have been\\".  If nothing else, I don't think I've ever read a book set primarily within a video game, so there's that.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Initially I embraced this book for what I thought it was, a love story which would stir one's emotions... It is not a love story, it is reminiscent of the movie \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\". Sensual, sexual, and  I found myself wanting to read certain passages out loud (I admit that was disarming when it happened).  Overused statements include, \\"biting her lower lip\\", \\"runs his hands through his coppery hair\\", etc.  Use as an aphrodisiac for your relationship but do not expect any intellectual value on this purchase.

0807014273|5.0|Viktor Frankl needs no introductions. I first read \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" (\\"'''' '''' ''''''\\") during my military service and I recall it making a great impression on me. Reading it now, more than twenty years later, it is still a remarkably moving and impressive book (especially given how short it is).<br /><br />In concise and somewhat dry prose, without resorting to over dramatisation, Frankl describes his personal experiences as a Holocaust survivor. He asks a basic question: how can the concentration camp experience help explain why people hang on to life. Frankl uses the experiences from the concentration camps, perhaps the worst possible place for a human being to believe and hang on to life, in order to formulate a psychotherapeutic method in finding a reason to live (Logotherapy). He describes the three stages a typical concentration camp prisoner goes through - shock, apathy and disillusionment - and concludes that regardless of the hardships every person finds a reason to live. For one person it might be God or religion; for another it might be a beloved one waiting for him on the outside; for yet another it might be some personal goal that still needs to be accomplished. Whatever the reason, humans find a way to hang on to life in the worst possible circumstances.<br /><br />Frankl's basic conclusion is that basic tenement of Jewish faith: freedom of choice (although Frankl did not frame his theory in any religious terms). Ultimately, regardless of the conditions of life, freedom of choice remains the one determining factor of how a person will live. And Frankl says that the right choice to make in order to have a meaningful life is to help others find their meaning of life, to be a decent person, a mentsch. His examples of decent \\"good\\" Nazis and indecent \\"bad\\" prisoners illustrate how this personal choice can make all the difference.<br /><br />It is no wonder \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is considered one of the most influential books on the 20th century.ntury.

0553582038|2.0|Books 1-3 were great.  Book 4 was a major disappointment.  Too many new characters and plot lines.  Not enough attention to existing/prior characters.  Author should have done the opposite of what he did.  Focus on all the characters with half the content instead of half the characters (several new).  Hope book 5 is better.
B00723NWJE|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />It's hard to believe Norah Jones just entered the spotlight in 2002. That's the year she went solo. That's also when she released her debut full-length album Come Away with Me. She did have an EP prior to that - First Sessions.<br />All were on the Blue Note label, traditionally a jazz label, but they knew they couldn't let Norah slip by. Besides her roots would be considered jazz.<br />\\"We let her find her own direction ... We knew that if she could develop her songwriting and we could find great songs, it would work,\\" A&R, Blue Note, Brain Bacchus said.<br />She grew up singing in church and took piano lessons as a child.<br />Her father, Ravi Shankar, was an Indian sitar player and her mother, Sue Jones, an American concert producer. They split and Norah lived with her mom, and at the age of 16, changed her name from Geethali Norah Jones Shankar, to Norah Jones.<br />It was also during this time she became a fan of Billy Holliday.<br />\\"My mom had this eight-album Billie Holiday set; I picked out one disc that I liked and played that over and over again,\\" Norah said.<br />From 2000 until they split at Christmas 2007, she was in a relationship with her bassist Lee Alexander.<br />Most say her latest CD, Little Broken Hearts, spawned from that break-up.<br />The first single \\"Happy Pills\\" certainly fits that mold. It's a musically upbeat song that finds the singer deciding she is better off alone. The song was written by her and Brian Burton (stage name Danger Mouse) who also produced the CD.<br />\\"We both were like `Oh my God, this is awesome' at first and then went away and listened over the weekend, explained Norah. \\"We didn't know if it fit on the record. But I couldn't stop singing it, and neither could Brian. Eventually we decided it was too much fun, it had to be there.\\"
0812979702|5.0|This is a quite unique and valuable book, that emphasizes the mental game.  It is unique in that the author is not a highly skilled golfer.  His real forte is tennis, and his book on the inner game of tennis is what lead him to venture to the sport of golf.  To summarize his approach, he emphasizes getting away from relying mainly on a myriad of mechanical thoughts, and instead on learning to trust your native abilities.  He emphasizes things like relaxation techniques, ways of minimizing the excessive tension that afflicts all but the very finest players.  (Although even the very best sometimes focus on the mechanical so much that excessive tension creeps into their games.  A few years ago Justin Leonard was in the midst of a slump until he finally realized that his grip pressure had increased FOUR fold!)  I will say that the first edition of this book went to extremes, practically claiming that no mechanical thoughts at all were needed.  I believe that some of that naivety has been eliminated in this edition. The ideal has to be a blend of mechanical and mental aproaches to the swing.  This book can help.  His approach is a needed counterpoint to the excessively mechanical approach that the typical serious amateur  player takes.  'Paralysis by analysis' is a real problem, and by addressing mental side of the game, and learning to TRUST the innate abilities our bodies have rather than trying to make everything happen, you can free up your swing and play with more confidence and less frustration.  Is this book a panacea?  No!  You will have to work at these skills just like you work on your mechanics for them to become effective under pressure, but they do help if you stick with them.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless is a tremendous book that tells a truly inspiring story. While the book is about a Navy SEAL, it is far more than a military biography. Through the narrative of Adam's drug-laden downfall to his turnaround led by faith, marriage, and the military, Eric Blehm translates his remarkable life into a universal story about redemption. Blehm's writing simultaneously keeps the author in the background while managing to convey the emotional upheavals that characterized Adam's journey from all-American high schooler to drug addict to Navy SEAL. Furthermore, the book deals with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in a completely non-partisan manner--rather than take a side on the foreign policy of the Bush administration, the book conveys the personal side of both conflicts. Adam Brown's relentless determination will inspire even the most cynical of readers, and even the most hardhearted will find it difficult to avoid tears as the book comes to a close. Eric Blehm has done a fantastic job of honoring Adam Brown's life, and anybody with an interest in humanity will appreciate this book.

I thought it was going to be a romantic novel and guess it was but with a bit  MORE. , It has a story line and It was quite the page turner and kept me reading.

1594203334|4.0|This is a delightful read with a number of terrific tips on child-raising. As a new parent, I'm implementing tactics of the French expounded upon in this book, and was pleased to see many of my already possessed ideals explained in print. However....<br />Keep in mind that the author is comparing the \\"worst\\" of American child upbringing and culture in general to the \\"best\\" of the French. This is the whole premise of the book, and if you read it while remembering that's the perspective, you will enjoy it immensely, and implement many of the ideas.<br />If you are an American, (such as myself) and take the contents personally, you may very well hate it. There are many ways to raise children, and all children are different; this book focuses specifically on the benefits of the French style. Nibble the contents, don't gulp them down. Digest what you wish, and leave the rest on your plate.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|i am a super big fan of taylor after watch this dvd it was like i was actually at her show she is amazing i really enjoyed it
0375703764|5.0|This book is amazing! I just started reading it about an hour ago. I can't stop reading it. I'm only stopping now because I'm hungry. If this book was made into a movie, I would spend the $15 to go see it in theaters. From the start of reading, you know something is wrong, but you can't place it. You know the House is wrong and it draws you in until you can find out. It reads like it's a biography but it's way more interesting then a normal biography. I the way it's told, it would read like The Amityville Horror does. But it's not about a haunted house per se. This book is hard to explain but well worth the money. I recommend it to everyone. It's creepy and eerie. I have never had a book that draws me in like this one does. You get into the story and your heart pounds at the right parts.
0007477155|5.0|The books came in a huge box, well wrapped and protected. The shippment took barely 3 weeks, for shipping from US to Eastern Europe. The books are in an amazing condition, fresh and crisp. What is not mentioned is that you also get a map of Vesteros and the Free cities, it was a very nice perk. The bookcase looks quite good on the reading table, solving one problem of finding a shelf for 7 books. The books themselves are on a good paper, same size font, which is a problem to some issues, but not this one.<br />Thank you very much for tis product.

B00479SVBU|4.0|We needed an FM transmitter for our Android phone. This works great. I even had a laptop with a movie playing over the FM transmitter. It is so multipurpose, all I've tried is line in to FM. Worked well (and sounded great) on a 1500 mile trip. I banged it up pretty good once and the case popped open and was a bit difficult to pop back (was afraid I'd break it), but with enough force just popped back together and still works great. I'm looking forward to using an SD Card as kind of a cassette (for those younger folk, it's like a CD, but different).

1426308469|5.0|My 5 year old son received this book as a birthday gift and loves it.  We read it every night before bedtime without fail.  We use it as a teaching tool without him even knowing what we're doing.  For example, it will tell you what each dinosaur eats (plants, meat, etc.) and we will say, \\"Oh, this dinosaur eats plants.  What does that make him?\\"  And our son will say, \\"Herbivore!\\" with lots of excitement.  We liked the way this book was set up so much.  I even ordered the other two books like it (Big Book of Animals, Big Book of Why), and my son is anxiously awaiting their arrival.  He also cannot wait until the \\"Big Book of Space\\" comes out in October 2012.
B007MU85D0|5.0|After hearing Little Talks a couple of times on the radio, I was desperate to find out who these guys were. Thank goodness for the internet and lyric search! After finding who it was I bought the album the same day.  Every song is at the very least \\"good\\" and most are excellent.  Besides Little Talks and Dirty Paws, arguably the two best songs on the album, Mountain Sound is remarkable and King and Lionheart is mezmerizing.  I've never heard two such unique voices blend so well and sound so great together; then when each is featured they sound fantastic on their own. If you like the Alt / Indy sound with an infusion of folk, there's no way you won't like this album of amazing songs.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|The talent of Fiona Apple is like the taste of wine.  She is an acquired taste that just gets better with each listen.  I am still trying to figure out the meaning of the album title. \\"Every Single Night\\" is my favorite track on this album. This song is either about the struggle of the creative process or about living with a mental illness. Fiona leaves the opinion of her songs open to her listeners, and I like that. The chimes on this song are lovely. \\"Werewolf\\" is a track about the love and hate relationship between two people.  The piano playing is superb on this song.  The musical arrrangements on the track on the song \\"Anything We Want\\". The percussion instruments are beautifully arranged in this song. This song is about living with a sense of complete freedom. \\"Jonathan\\" is the first love song I have heard dedicated to a man.  This song is about how actions speak louder than words in a romantic relationship.  \\"Hot Knife\\" is another excellent song. I have never heard of a woman referred to as a pat of butter in a song. I like Fiona's creative lyrics in this song very much. \\"Left Alone\\" is a song with groovy piano playing and equally excellent drum playing.  This song is a downer lyrically, but the instruments make it special.  \\"Periphery\\" is a song that reminds me to appreciate the things I have.  I don't have to be envious of the things that other people possess. I love the music of Fiona Apple.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher Book. Lee Child does an excellent job and cannot wait for his next Jack Reacher thriller.
B0000524CY|5.0|I remember being assigned to read the book \\"The Exorcist\\" by William Peter Blatty, for a class entitled \\"Atheism and Theism\\" in the Theology curriculum at Marquette University when I was a student there in 1973. It was a night in late November when I sat down in an old rocking chair by the window in my room in the old boarding house I lived in that was mainly populated by Upper-level Marquette students. It was about 5:30 PM or so on a Thursday night, and I thought I would read this book for a few hours, which looked SO UNINTERESTING at the time.<br /><br />I had no inkling of the literary journey I was about to embark on.<br /><br />Snow started falling outside and shone heavily under the streetlight in the alley behind the house. It was a smooth feeling. It fell to a depth of at least 3-4 feet.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I was engrossed in one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. I didn't put it down until I was done...... around 6 AM the next morning. \\"The Exorcist\\" by William Peter Blatty remains one of my favorite books of all time.<br /><br />I saw the movie a short time later. It was ... and IS ... tremendous and terrifying. When Linda Blair's head did the 360 for the priests, there was wretching in the theatre. I had NEVER seen that before...and considering the time frame (almost 40 years ago) it was WAY AHEAD of its' time in imaginative terror. AND they, the book/movie, were supposedly based on a TRUE story.<br /><br />Ellen Burnstyn, Jason Miller, Linda Blair, Lee J. Cobb and Max Von Sydow as \\"the Exorcist\\" gave masterful performances. I especially liked Jason Miller's portrayal of the priest/physician/psychiatrist who ultimately tips the scale towards Good and God, and away from Evil and the devil, by giving his own life.<br /><br />A complex movie which almost certainly has to be watched a few times to get a feel for all that is put into this cinematic masterpiece. I enjoy watching it STILL, to this very day.

0956827810|1.0|got this book, was looking forward to reading it and somehow there are no words and only blank pages. Think it is some vendor quality defect that Amazon needs to replace me with a proper book soon. This has never happened to me before.<br /><br />**Update**: just got a proper copy, some of the chapters are very insightful especially for reading in the bathroom.
1451648537|5.0|This was an amazing biography, probably the best I have read.  It was packed full of information about Jobs that I didn't know, as well as about the computer industry as a whole.  He had, in my opinion, just the right amount of technical information to make you able to understand what Apple and other computer companies were doing, but not enough to bog down a lay person (in my opinion, anyway).  I actually found the tech history embedded in the book fascinating.<br /><br />What took this book from \\"good\\" or \\"great\\" to excellent was the last few chapters; the author clearly spent a great deal of time with Jobs before his death, and he really brought the emotion from Jobs' last months through to the reader in a way that not many biographers have the opportunity to do.  I really felt that I got to see an intimate view of Jobs', both at home and at work.  I was also amazed by the number of people he seems to have consulted in writing the book, and his ability to get a well rounded look at Jobs.<br /><br />On the other hand, I do think he got a little too wrapped up in the mythology of Jobs'; while he does a good job stating other people's negative views, and clearly showing Jobs' faults, I sometimes felt he was under-emphasizing or glossing over the fact that Jobs' inventions were often just improvements on other people's ideas.  He does tell us this, and he does at times discuss past attempts at the same idea, but it easily gets lost in his glowing description of how the products \\"revolutionized\\" technology.  While I would not want to understate the importance of the products Apple has produced, I think it's important to remember that very little of it was truly original (although,  certainly, they vastly improved on older versions), and I think that gets lots in the telling here at times.<br /><br />I also really do wish that a short Epilogue had been added after Jobs died; I know the publishing came very close on the heels of his death, so I am assuming it was just not feasible at the time, but I definitely felt like it detracted from the book that there was not at least a statement regarding when he died etc.  I had to go to Wikipedia to remind myself when I finished the book, and there was some great info. there about speeches and memorials etc. that would have made a great finisher to this book....even if it was only a couple of pages long.  Hopefully this will be added in a later edition.<br /><br />Reading the one star reviews, it seems like a lot of people don't exactly understand what a biography is; a lot of people seem to have read this book hoping for a psychological analysis of Jobs and/or an explanation of his approach to business.  That is NOT what a biography is.  A biography, as defined by dictionary.com is \\"a written account of another person's life\\"; i.e. a history.  If you approached this thinking that it would have Jobs' explanation on how to run a business, you were bound to be disappointed; and I for one would have been disappointed if that was what the book had turned out to be, I actually wanted a biography.  Not to mention, if you couldn't make SOME leaps yourself in figuring out why Steve was the way he was from the information presented here, I don't think the author can help you.  It's alright for an author to expect some analysis on your part.  This book did exactly what biographies do; it chronicled the life of the PERSON (not the company) that was the subject.<br /><br />Again, this was one of the best biographies I have read (and it prompted me to buy Issacson's Franklin biography), and I highly recommend it to anyone, regardless of whether they love or hate Jobs/Apple.  In fact, I think this book helps shed some light on WHY so many people dislike Jobs; it might not excuse the faults, but it does at least explain them.  Definitely one of my top 10 reads this year.ot feasible at the time, but I definitely felt like it detracted from the book that there was not at least a statement regarding when he died etc.  I had to go to Wikipedia to remind myself when I finished the book, and there was some great info. there about speeches and memorials etc. that would have made a great finisher to this book....even if it was only a couple of pages long.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|The redundentcy of the phrases the author used wanted to make me scream!However, I preferred the first book \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" a lot better. Which by the way led me to finish the trilogy. But otherwise it did at least get your juices flowing every now and then.

B007LNJ4YW|1.0|At the incessant behest of all my music-blogging friends, I bought this album.  I had expected something especially inventive or moving, but I could not get past the pointlessly sloppy reverb or late-80's casio drum samples.  I'm not sure I understand the vinyl release; from a sonic perspective the album seems more suitable for a cassette release.
B0040UAYI4|3.0|I dislike the analog stick on any first person or 3rd person action game.  I have difficulty controlling it.  when I found out there was a product that allowed you to use a keyboard and mouse like a PC, I immediately bought it.  After it arrived, I followed the instructions.  The setup software was understandable and easy enough.  Connect to computer, run application, set keys up for controller emulation.  Unfortunately when I connected it to my Playstation 3 the mouse didn't work.  I have a Logitech Performance MX.  I went to their website and found that the compatibility of Mice is SEVERELY limited.  there is whole message board groups about which mice work and don't work.  i went down to my local computer store and had serious trouble fining a mouse that was listed as 'works'  I eventually ended up ordering one online and am now waiting for it.<br /><br />IMPORTANT:<br />Before buying, check your keyboard and mouse compatibility!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty fun and some of the games can be challenging. It's a great way to waste time. I wish they would give more free games though and didn't have to collect points to get to a new level.

0061478784|5.0|I received this book in great condition, like it was brand new! The story itself was very very good. It's a completely different story from the movie, but it still worked. This has become one of my favorite books and i definitely recommend this!
B000JMKO3C|4.0|Despite its rather bleak title, Veronika Decides to Die, is actually an exploration of what it means to be alive and to live an honest life. It explores the experience of a young woman, who, having survived a suicide attempt, finds herself in a mental asylum. Freed from the pressures of being sane, she is able to explore who she is and how she longs to live her life. I've avoided this book for a long time, largely because of the title, but it's actually a beautiful book, and one of Coelho's best. There's a messy bit at the beginning where Coelho awkwardly inserts himself in the story, tying his own much publicised time in mental institutions to the story, but once you get beyond that it's an inspiring read about leading an authentic life.

0307970299|5.0|I started reading on a Friday and waited to start again on Sunday when I knew I had time so as not to have to put it down. I read with tears of joy and sadness. I felt like I was with her as she hiked along with each painful step, I kept thinking how could someone so weak emotionally be strong enough to even think about embarking on this journey. I know there is no way I could, one foot blister and I would have found the closest path home. I wondered why was this important enough to her to go through so much torture. Not sure what is her biggest accomplishment writing this wonderful book or completing the PCT hike, one thing for sure one would not have been accomplished without the other. Congratulations to Cheryl for finding her way to a new and better life!So happy for her to finally be free of the demons that brought her down. Amazing!
