B00571F26Y|5.0|This book was recommended by our doctor. So much of it really makes sense. We look forward to seeing how it changes our lives.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has been on the top seller list.  Thought I would see why.  It was very well written.  The plot was surprising.  I could not put the book down until I finished it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|You can't help but get wrapped up in this fantastic story. I haven't seen the movie (yet) but I am so anxious to!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|very addicting.  I could send a lot of time playing the game.  I am not a gamer but this is fun.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Was a Great movie and we have added this to our collection.  I recommend this to others, and It received a five star because the packaging, Movie and quality was excellent.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is one of my favorite games.  I play it sometimes just to relax and keep my brain working.  This games gives you some options as to different ways to play.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Was a Great movie and we have added this to our collection.  I recommend this to others, and It received a five star because the packaging, Movie and quality was excellent.
1423113462|4.0|This was a good book, but it only gets 4 instead of 5 stars because of the length. It's a tad bit too long, but certainly a good book to start off a new series. Jason and Leo are really cool characters who you really start to like. Piper, not so much. She's a bit too whiny, but if she weren't there, the book wouldn't work.<br /><br />All in all, this book is better than three of the books from the previous series. I enjoyed it, and so will you.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Was a Great movie and we have added this to our collection.  I recommend this to others, and It received a five star because the packaging, Movie and quality was excellent.
1423140591|3.0|Sup everybody. This was a decent read, but it has become clear that after the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, that Rick Riordan has made books that are increasingly longer than they need to be. This book didn't need the other character's points of view to be so long. It needed more Percy and less Hazel and the other guy, can't remember his name. Riordan seems to work well in the seventy to ninety thousand range, which is somewhere between 300 and 400 pages. Anything more and it seems that the story is forced.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there are a few good parts and the story starts and ends well, but the ending is a little less exciting. I wasn't looking forward to the next book so much. Have a good one y'all.
B0087DFIYA|4.0|Was a Good movie but a little strange but we have added this to our collection.  I recommend this to others, and It received a four star because the packaging, Movie was strange but the quality was excellent.
B006LSZECO|4.0|About half way through thtis book, I almost put it down, but once I was over that hump, it was an excellent read!  I recommend it.
B0088X7YMS|5.0|Was a Great movie and we have added this to our collection.  I recommend this to others, and It received a five star because the packaging, Movie and quality was excellent.
B002BWP49M|4.0|Great movie! I wasn't able to see it at the theater, I'm really glad I gave myself an early Christmas gift.p
B004IF8TLU|3.0|For me, this movie is more of a 4 star movie, but I saw it when it first came out and I have good memories of it!  It's a little dated by now, which is why I give it 3 stars.  I would recommend for ages 12 and up due to bad language and sexual innuendos.  A child a little younger could watch it if you're prepared to speak to them about the inappropriate parts (should they ask).  Good performances from everyone.  Be sure to watch through the end credits for a short clip at the end.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|5 stars. Great book. The way Charlie thinks is just wonderful. He breaks things down, recognizes the bad and takes from it the good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Had this app on my phone and love it.  It is very easy to use and lots of versions to choose from.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game, and so do my kids. It is one of the first apps I install on any new device.
0765325950|5.0|Been reading this series for close to 20 years.  A bittersweet read!  Full of action and you will not regret the wait.  Sad, because it is the last book.
B003IDMURM|4.0|I liked book i reaaly enjoyed reading it as always John Grisham has been interesting to read and could not wait to see the end of the story
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I chose this rating because people on the other line could not hear me speak. I tried using it for a week and was unsatisfied. I am planning on sending it back this week. This pink case also cracked. I hope I can find out how to do this and it is not too late.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|We had a great book discussion on this book at our Book Club.  All of us liked the book. A few people said it was hard to get into at first.
0143123173|3.0|OK, I have to admit that I don't like westerns so you will have to take this review with a grain of salt. But Craig Johnson is so prolific and so highly rated on Amazon that I decided to try The Cold Dish. I had to force myself through the first 50 pages. However, once I let go of my expectation that this was supposed to be a murder mystery and accepted that this is mostly cultural anthropology about Wyoming with a murder sprinkled in here and there, I began to like it. The vast majority of the book is about the people, the cultures, and the forces of Nature (with a capital N) in a part of the country that most of us know little about.  The characters are appealing and the descriptive phrases, especially those relating to the landscape, and finely wrought. There is even a lengthy passage about a genuine, self-sacrificing act of heroism of the sort that is seldom portrayed in modern fiction. Soul-stirring and uplifting. The murder mystery itself, however, isn't much to write home about. The dead guy was a rat who deserved to die. The \\"clues\\"-- such as they are-- mostly involve the protagonist being so intimately bound to the land and the people that he just \\"knows\\" when someone is behaving oddly, or \\"knows\\" that a real hunter would never use such a weapon.  I didn't think that the clues convincingly led to the killer. If you like to read books about the American West or if you would like to know what it's like to live in rural Wyoming, this is the author for you.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Michael Connelly has done it again with the loveable, occasionally flawed Harry Bosch character.<br />Crime writing at its very best.
B002NFCHBA|5.0|The Chopin Complete Edition contains 17 cds.  I had no idea there was going to be so much music.  I've only gotten through the first three cds and I absolutely love the music.  There's ballads, piano, orchestra...it's very soothing to listen to.<br />Anyone who likes classical music absolutely MUST add this collection to their library.<br />Best,<br />Gina E.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I loved this part of the series---especially the WWII years,  as these were the years I was a baby and small child growing up.  Being reminded of the great sacrifices made during those years by so many nations and people is a wonderful way to be reminded of the power of good versus evil in the world.  Conversely,  it is also all too clear that there is a great deal of pure evil in the quest for power. These are history's lessons; sometimes I wonder if and/or when we will ever really grow as a civilization and not continually repeat our missteps.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I like it because you can see the world and a great book is this is the won. I love it you should get this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even thou you can get it for free the survival mode is veeeeeerrrrrrrryyyy fun, i could play this all day long
B000067FP8|5.0|The i loves it and am very happy.This product was shipped fast and would not mind buying from again .... thanks
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|has the old clancy flair !  would recommend for clancy fans who have read the entire jack ryan series so that the reader can relate to the older characters.
B00015YVD6|5.0|The i loves it and am very happy.This product was shipped fast and would not mind buying from again .... thanks
B006G2124E|5.0|This movie is thought provoking, sad, funny, scary, all at the same time. The scary part is how the white society in the south viewed & treated black people, and everyone just seemed to accept it as OK. Only people who lived through that period could understand what it was like, a short movie obviously cannot depict what the situation really must have been in everyday life. I have always wondered how Hitler could have gotten away with the atrocities he committed, and here we had something so similar going on right in the USA 30 years later. That is the only thing I can think of to compare it to, if you were black and living in the south, your very life was in danger if you stepped out of the lines, how sad people were treated that way.
B001XVS2LO|4.0|fun to watch, great cast. Loved Thandie Newton and Gerard Butler in this. They have great on screen chemistry. left me wanting to see more. where's the sequel Ritchie??
0316035904|4.0|David Sedaris is simply the Seinfield of books. If you enjoy randomness and wit, this is the book to get.<br />This book is nice and simple to read when your stuck in the water closet. Possibly even good to use at  a Dr.'s waiting room.... unless you want to talk to the person next to you with the nasty stitches oozing all that yellow puss.<br />It is back pocket friendly for those of us who wear mom jeans or just good to stick in your friends' handbag.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is great. It fits good with my Kindle Fire. Use it with the high speed connector. It's really fast.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|The Barbie collection is growing but my house is not. This is a cute storage solution that doubles as a playmat.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Keeps me updated on all my emails! I love this App.<br />Have it on my kindle and my cell phone.
B0090X4GJE|4.0|I really like this album and hope that Ms. Goulding has continued success in the United States.  Keep up the good work.
B000GWE44U|4.0|But overall it's still a good movie to watch. Jack Nicholson played that role very well in the Shining. If the weather is cold, stay in the house and watch the Shining.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|I GOT TO SEE THIS EARLY BUT IM STILL GOING TO BUY THE OFFICIAL COPY WHEN IT COMES OUT. THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST ANIMATED BATMAN MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. I LOVE THE BLOOD AND GORE AND THE FIGHT BETWEEN BATMAN AND SUPERMAN....I CANT DESCRIBE..IT WAS EPIC!! IF YOUR A FAN OF THE GRAPHIC NOVEL I GUARANTEE YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED. THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITLY GEARED TOWARD A MATURE AUDIENCE (WELL EVERYTHING FRANK MILLAR WRITES IS LOL). GREAT MOVIE
B0024RIMBG|5.0|sit back and relax and watch the show these girls are truly amazingwith voices of angels i brought two one for keeping incase the first wears out
B007WPM4P0|4.0|A very enjoyable heartwrenching tale. Well acted, beautiful scenery, and realistic re-enactment of the British World war 1 fighting against the Germans in France. But not for the faint hearted. Yes, I would recommend it to someone.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I did not find this a compelling - need to read! It was not realistic. It was disappointing compared to author's previous books.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|like the title of this review says, it is the best show ever to be created. Dan Harrmon is the greatest person alive to have made this show possible with an amazing cast to bring life to the show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game it feels so real and you get to do everything I would recommend this app definitely if u like horses
B008QI6EHQ|5.0|Almost anyone who writes a review about Mein Kampf will inevitably put his own preconceptions and political biases into his judgments regarding the book's content and its author's character. While much of what is said in a review of Mein Kampf might actually come from the book and might be based on an understanding of why Hitler wrote as he did, the odds are low. Half of the reviews in this product listing probably never read the book, but they think they know all about it anyway. They're wrong.<br /><br />Read the book yourself. Understand the situation in which Germany found itself during the early 20th century, especially during the period between the two world wars. Try to find any idea espoused by Hitler that wouldn't really work, if it were tried. (For example, human eugenics.) Try to find any political or historical claim made by Hitler that isn't really true.<br /><br />Pay attention to the details as you read Mein Kampf. Hitler was writing for people who were alive and alert to political developments in Germany at that time. It isn't likely at all that he would stick a bunch of lies into his book because the lies would be noticed and their teller would be laughed at.<br /><br />If you think you know more about the political and social conditions in Germany in 1925 than Adolf Hitler did, then you are probably wrong, and the reason for your mistaken confidence is that you've been falsely assured, again and again, year after year, of \\"how things were\\" by propagandists who want never again to have to deal with the likes of Adolf Hitler.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game isn't like most others where you have  to pay real money. I love  the graphics and it's simple gameplay. Would definitely recommend it!
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is the new version of the old Christmas Classic Miracle on 34th Street. This was well done and quite entertaining.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|As a Stephen King fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Is it perfect, no. However it's classic King and I found it almost impossible to put down.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|This is one of the best musicals ever made. You can not beat this movie for the songs, dancing or the acting is superb. Have never tired of watching this and singing along, enjoying the expertise of the dancing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is amazing. I love it. The game has great vision and allows me to be able to feel what taking care of a horse is like.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|No movie is totally accurate about our historical people. However this movie does an excellent job in showing the man Sgt. York was. An exlcellent movie and as always Gary Cooper proved why he is one of Hollywoods GREAT actors.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it took me a total of 2 days to read this.. Not your average love story.  Get this book, it's 1000% perfect. I love it!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this mouse when I received it. I had not purchased this brand nor, sadly to say, even heard of it before. I have spent over 20 years in IT and even longer as a gamer and typically purchased Logitech, Microsoft, or MadCatz gaming mice. All of them are good products but I was never completely happy with them from a personal level. I have purchased dozens of mice over the years as I have worn out or taken my frustration out on many a mouse. Given the cost of those mice (over $120 in most cases), not the wisest thing to do.<br /><br />The cost of this Anker mouse had me somewhat skeptical at first because it as such a good price I thought somethign must be wrong. There is nothing wrong. The mouse is well made and fits my hand very nicely. If you have smaller hands you may find this mouse less comfortable, but that is to be expected since, by looking at the picture, you can see it is a larger mouse. The weights that come with it are easy to put in and I do recommend putting them in unless you prefer a light mouse to game with. Aside from that, the mouse works beautifully in games from WoW to any first person shooter. The programmable buttons are easy to set with the software and with only 9, keeps things simple.<br /><br />If you are looking for an inexpensive yet solid quality gaming, and regular use, mouse, this ANker mouse is worth the money.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is well written and entertaining.  I never wanted to put it down! It continues on the journey of Eva and Gideon as their love for one another grows, but their pasts challenge their need to be together.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Love the musical, love the movie love the music. Everything about Les Miserables i thought was the best and the actors was outstanding
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|.....to easily be, one of the best films you might see in recent years.  Very well done, acted, written screenplay and was one to watch many times over and never gonna get old.  LOVED getting to see Cicely in a film again, always liked her - such a Lady.  But very, very Poignant film, relevant in any age or decade.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Even though I was pretty sure I knew what was going to happen, it was a well written story. I was very happy with it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|kindle fire app needs some bugs worked out but I'm in love with this app it a must have for horse lover's...I live in an appartment now but was a farm girl growing up so farm choirs and horses are in my blood..the way the horses reacted to commands and their interactions in this game are so realistic ..the game creator was a farm kid too I can tell
0823015033|5.0|Fantastic tips and amazing photos take you through every step. Great buy for any figurative sculptor. Great photos of stellar work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this app its fun  but sometimes confusing its best to listen to the directions/ totorial to understand the game
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Can't beat the price!  Find out what all the kids are raving about!  See the destruction and violence!<br /><br />In a waiting room?  Stuck on the train?  Going for a bus or plane trip?  Kid getting fidgety?<br /><br />This app looks great on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Wheeeeeeee!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Just started reading the Jack Reacher books. I sure hope the rest of the books are as good as this one. I couldn't put this one down.
0789420708|5.0|i love this book. i really hope DK makes more of these books soon. Also, the need to some more big book versions.
1607066017|5.0|So, I saw this advertised somewhere and was drawn in by the alien couple with their breast feeding baby on the cover. I read the synopsis and thought it might be interesting. I finally got it through the library yesterday and stayed up late to devour it in a single night. The basic plot line - lovers from alternate ides of the war are trying to escape capture by either side, with baby in tow - is not that revolutionary, but the way it's executed here is completely amazing. The characters are believable, the art is stunning, and the world is the perfect amount of unexplained bizarreness to make you want to keep reading to figure out how it all fits together. All in all - completely brilliant. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this series.
B006E2VTG2|5.0|Simply amazing movie. Great acting, directing, story and writing. Both Zoe and Jordi are very strong actors. And I want to work with Olivier Megaton soon.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|The movie is fun, and mostly holds up to the test of time. Delivery was prompt and film was in better than reported condition.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this show is amazing. Only reason I started to watch it is because I heard that Adam Levine was going to be on this season. Hearing that Adam was going to be on the show come season 2 I bought and watched season 1 on here. Well I fell in love and continued to watch it. The tv pass application is amazing as well. I would recommend this show(and the amazon tv pass) to anybody and I have already.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|This was a recomended book, but I must say it was really different.  Makes me want to avoid North Korea.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I wanted to watch some stuff on my iphone and found this app to help watch you tube videos.  I love it.
B003O86FMW|1.0|For a girl that was supposed to have grown up quickly and would have had to mature just as fast, she sure acts like a spoiled present day teenager.
0761169431|5.0|It was such a great present, he received two, one from his wife and one from his mom.  It is fun to do.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This game is really challenging,  which is great. The only thing I'm not liking is the calibration. There should be a calibration setting. Way more often than not, I have to make my image a lot bigger because while trying to touch one square, I've hit two others, and I don't have fat fingers. Overall, good game. Please create a calibration option.
B009LREA1S|5.0|I wanted to get this as a digital HD movie but didn't want to add another dvd case to our collection.  I am starting to buy things digitally so I don't have to worry about storing it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Not a single complaint about this product, it's exactly what you expect it to be.  This is such a great movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Gotta watch every episode.  This is such a good show.  Amazon makes it so easy to catch up.  I can't wait to see next season.
B005D63ICI|5.0|One of the most incredible TV shows I've seen...I hope it last forever. Dexter has everything we need to clean and protect our society
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The app is pretty good. I've seen some issues when going through photos with the captions being off ( captions going with the wrong photos) but other than that , no issues.
0785152458|3.0|A just \\"okay\\" follow up to the original.  Everything is too extreme, life is given too little regard, and just because you once and a while have your bad guys say \\"that's messed up\\" doesn't justify the places the book goes.  I am all on board for a bit of the old ultra violence, but there has to be something behind it.  Kick-Ass 2 exists in a different world from the first and it is an imaginary crappy one.  That isn't to say the book doesn't have its entertaining parts, but just not as enjoyable as the first.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|what is not to love about twitter.<br />Allows humans to publish their every move because it is so completely necessary.... lol not... but it is fun!
B001F751EC|5.0|This is not your typical Hollywood film. It is good though and very sad. I will not give away the ending, but I believe you should watch it. This sort of thing goes on here in the States also.
B004G600A4|4.0|Disney has made some great films (Sleeping Beauty, The Lion King), a lot of good films (Mulan, Beauty and the Beast) and some bad films (The Black Cauldron).<br />Tangled isn't great - it won't achieve cartoon immortality like Snow White, but boy is it hilarious!<br /><br />The first reason it succeeds are the characters, namely the main protagonist \\"Flynn Rider\\", a.k.a. Eugene Sebastian. Flynn is extremely entertaining, both to young kids and adults.  One can't help but crack up at Flynn's \\"Smoulder\\" or his conversations with Rapunzel that often go like this:<br />Rapunzel: \\"Something brought you here...fate...destiny...\\"<br />Flynn: \\"A horse.\\"<br /><br />Rapunzel is good too - the filmmakers found a mix of damsel-in-distress and action heroine that works. The antagonist role is filled by Mother Gothel - a ample villain without that air of menace that ruined childhoods, unlike almost any character in Pinocchio or The Black Cauldron. I particularly liked the Stabbington Brothers - two thugs (Ron Perlman) double-crossed by Flynn.<br /><br />But Tangled's biggest success is one that no one ever notices.<br />Tangled is a movie about a girl with 70-foot long hair. Therefore, the movie will succeed or fail ON THE HAIR ALONE. If the hair was animated badly - if it looked fake, then the entire film would be lost.<br />Yet no one ever mentions the hair - it looks so lifelike, so beautiful. The CGI, which animator Kelly Ward spent 6 years designing, is so good - so lifelike, it looks almost like an oil-painting. The whole film is visually beautiful.<br />No one ever talks about a movie \\"with good hair\\", but if there ever was one, it would be Tangled.<br /><br />Quirky, memorable characters, rousing, hilarious, musical numbers, gorgeous, lush, animation, and clean, witty, hilarious humour boost Tangled to one of Disney's most entertaining films, even if it's not the most memorable or groundbreaking of family features.<br /><br />5 Stars for Tangled - a fun, enjoyable, hilarious comedy for the whole family!ous comedy for the whole family!
B000MCH5P4|5.0|This was a good film. All of the acting, writing, etc. were done very well. I will watch this again.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It really help me. This is the best battery app ever. You must buy this app. Buy it right now!
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I generally enjoyed reading this, but I was left wishing it was a bit more fleshed out. I guess that goes with the territory of a Novella, though.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Loved the movie my friend had it on her christmas list so I found out where to buy it and ordered it , she was surprised christmas morning.
B007REW8DO|5.0|Arms and Jar of Hearts are my favorite on this CD. She has a fantastic and unique voice, would recommend buying this one.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Bought it for a friend as a gift she was very surprised and happy. She had heard Lianne on NPR and knew she had to have the CD so I got it for her.
B000X107GI|5.0|The product is just as described and the price is right.  I recommend the product but just beware that there are many batteries and they do have a shelf life so unless you have a need for them they might expire. But for the price it is worth it.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My grand-daughter LOVES the site.  She can play for hours and has lots saved to her files.  Good job for diversity too.
0156012197|5.0|I got this product for my nephew's 6th birthday.  He loves this book.  I read it when I was a kid and still remember it.  It is classic and all kids should read it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is awesome and you should read it. I think you will LOVE it. But you have to be a HUGE fan.I love it so much. It is really sad though. At the end something happens to the  'rose'

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not very original.  Too many of the same old tired clichés, the language is unimaginative, the plot recycled.  Will not continue the series.

B007N5YIUS|1.0|I was really looking forward to trying this game since so many people seem to enjoy playing it. I don't know what's up with the program that is supposed to download the game but it just wouldn't work for me, no matter what I tried! I really don't have a review about the game because of this. My rating is for the program itself that downloads the game. I tried to download several games so it's not just this game, it's the program itself. I finally gave up and deleted the program itself, redownloaded it and it still didn't work. I again deleted the program and it'll be a while before I try again! If this game is available through some other company, maybe I'll try again some time.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Good game to play when you want to relax, , Easy to play and learn good relaxing game for the whole family
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It works about half the time although it does have good graphics and it is a good game for people who like horses.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book is VERY similar to 50 shades. I'm surprised there isn't a plagiarism lawsuit somewhere. Good story. Well written. The sex scenes are a little better than 50 shades, and at least not as repetitive as 50 shades.<br />Good read, but unnecessary, if you have already read 50...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVE this series. The era is fascinating, and the writing quick and witty. The costumes, sets, cinematography and acting are all fantastic. If you're looking for a new series to get into, Downton Abbey won't disappoint.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm speechless. The structure of the book is amazing and I couldn't keep my eyes off.I'm glad I read the book, and I'm looking forward too watch the movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|When I'm bored I play this to waste time. lots of different games. not really hard but yet still entertaining. and you play for points.
0765325950|5.0|title says it all The book itself is amazing as well. A great continuation from the original works of Jordan.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|There is a reason Grisham is one of the best-selling novelists of our time - interesting characters, involved storylines and leading characters one has to like, even while being dismayed by their feet of clay.<br /><br />A really good read!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am not in to that kind of sex. I really couldnt even finish reading the book. I do not believe that style of intimacy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use the Bible App all the time. It has helped me with study plans, I receive reminders to read the word which are a blessing to me. I am truly grateful, I like it so much it is installed on my phone and my tablet.

030759565X|5.0|I recieved this cookbook as a birthday gift. Although I've only made a handful of recipes from it so far (and they were all great), I've read it twice now just for pleasure. The pictures are gorgeous, the prose is entertaining and chatty, and its truly a delight to page through. Even my husband sat down and read through the two \\"Main Dish\\" sections (I asked him to pick out recipes). If you are a fan of her blog, then you will really enjoy this book. Others have criticized the long-winded style; I see where they are coming from but to me the slow pace of the book and the MANY beautiful pictures are strengths over other cookbooks.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really love solitaire. I can only complain that it doesn't always respond to taps. Also flips off screen in middle of game
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'm a huge John Grisham fan; I've read everything he's written, most of them more than once.  For frame of reference, my favorites (and books I'd give 5 starts to) include his earlier works - A Time to Kill, The Firm, The Client, The Runaway Jury, and The Pelican Brief.  I felt that The Racketeer was more inline with these works than with his more recent ones like The Appeal or The Confession, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  It's got a solid story with a few, very enjoyable, Grisham-esque twists and turns along the way. Certainly recommended.
B0091REZMW|2.0|this game just doesn't cut it at all. Doesn't respond to taps on screen. Interuptions are not nice.<br />I dumped it
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I gave it to my daughter-in-law for Christmas. Daughter-in-law loved it. I listened to it also. I think this group has made an impact on the music scene.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I have a very short attention span and easily get side tracked.  However this film managed to keep my attention all the way through. I would recommend it even if you've never seen the other batman movies.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|This was my gift to my son for Christmas. Son loved it receiving it. This will be one of those &#34;forever loved&#34; movies.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My husband said I owe him big for sitting through this musical. They do sing a lot but it's hilarious. Even my husband laughed a lot through out the movie. The language can be strong so I wouldn't watch this with young children.
0393338827|5.0|An excellent book that every investor should read.  Also suggest reading Reckless Endangerment which describes in detail how the financial crisis of 2007/8 came about.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|Pat Metheny's current project is another winner.  I was lucky to see the band perform twice recently - I love the interplay between Pat and Sax Chris Potter.  Rest of band is stellar as well.
B000002NJM|1.0|poor quality when you get to the 5th  song it started bouncing / all scrached up... and I hate having to return items...but will never buy from this source again..lost my money...
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|I'm returning it but that's only because I didn't realize what material the band was made of. I should have taken a closer look at one of the high resolution images. Other than that, very nice watch.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Hated it-sex outshined the story line-perverted point of view-not my style at all-would not recommend it to anyone-too much -awful
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey.  Season 3  great writers,,  love historical dress and manners of Brits,  no fowl language,,,well developed characters.  Hate to miss an episode.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|My tablet has a problem with over heating I have been able to use this app to manage the problem with the temperature meter it is easy to use and very customizable it's also kinda cool to watch how much my battery lasts but the odd thing was for some reason on December 21,2012 it crashed every time I opened it
B00992CF6W|5.0|I played the PC version and I said they need a tablet version a few weeks later they came out with a tablet edition. I play it every day 5 hours. (Doesn't take up a lot of space on a kindle fire)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book to find out for myself why it is so popular. I have never read a piece of published fiction so poorly written. The main character's inner dialogue is annoying and downright stupid. Even the sex scenes don't titillate because the writing is so poor. I guess the author is laughing at her silly readers all the way to the bank.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A well written, and entertaining account, even if somewhat bizarre in places. Definitely a book to read before seeing the film
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This quirky story was a bit outlandish, but I loved it all the same. I enjoyed the old man and all the characters he joined up with.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought it was a great game really cool and I definitely think this is something my daughter would love to play
B00A80SHFM|4.0|This is to be listened to after you see the movie and like it (if you do); don't buy it and expect it to be as great as the soundtrack from the Broadway play, this is definitely not as good, actually can't compare.  I could only appreciate it after seeing the movie.
B0089XH38M|5.0|Great Product. Works as advertised. Installed it on all our cell phones and tablets and have not experienced any issues.
B000NQPZCO|5.0|If you haven't seen it, you have to!  Amazing acting - Al Pacino & Johnny Depp are amazing as ever - it's really keeps your interest and watching carefully through the end, and at that time you'll probably want to watch it again.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I bought this scanner for myself so I could scan my negatives and slides without having to send they off to an unknown place, risk losing them forever, and paying a huge amount of $$ to have them digitized.<br />I have used a flatbed scanner with a backlight attachment to do this same job, but the speed of the DB-Tech far surpasses anything I can do with the flatbed scanner setup.<br />I also have a dedicated negative slide scanner that I bought several years ago for about $40.  This setup uses a negative holder that will only except four frames at a time.  My older B/W negatives are uncut full rolls of 24 or 36 exposures and I didn't want to cut them down to be able to scan them.  Again the DB-Tech scanner allows me to scan the entire roll without cutting it.  I can scan an entire 24 frame roll of negatives in 2-3 minutes with excellent results!<br />The only drawback I have found so far is the plastic negative holder.  It is easily scratched by the negatives.  It is important to ensure your negatives are as clean as possible.<br />The plastic negative holder is a replaceable item and cost about $4; however, I have been unsuccessful at finding them in stock online.<br />The title on this product states the DB-Tech is 5 Mega Pixel scanner.  The model I bought was a 10 mega pixel version and you can select between the 5 or 10 MP settings.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I wish that it was a rear facing camera. I used it only once, seems a little awkward. However, at least there is a camera.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved the intrique of this book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a fast paced with mystery with lots of twists and turns.  I ordered two other Kate Morton's book after reading &#34;The Secret Keeper.&#34;
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is amazing its an easy way to see how much battery life I have left and how much time I can spend doing certain thing
030758836X|5.0|This was probably the most-talked-about book of 2012 and for good reason - it's an engaging mystery written with a razor-sharp wit. It will keep you up at night, turning pages until you come to the surprising truth about the girl who vanished.  While the mystery aspect of the book will keep you intrigued, it's the portrait of a marriage (and the character sketch of two dysfunctional people) that will hook you in.
0385738773|2.0|Spoiler alert!<br /><br />What a total disappointment!  Too much senseless loss of life!  It's like he ran out of ideas and figured he'd keep us turning the pages by more blood and guts.  I kept reading because in one of the previous books they insisted that things are not as they appear, so I assumed that some if not all of what he was experiencing was created by the thing in his head.  That not only were the experiences needed to create the map, they were created to illicit the emotional response they needed.  Nope.  Things were exactly as they appeared and a wasted opportunity by the author to have a twist that would actually mean something.  He would be forever scarred by the experience, but his friends would all be there and a cure would be found.  Happy ending.  Why call the book Death Cure when it is meaningless?  What a waste of my time!
0307949486|5.0|Well written. Does not let you go till the very last dot. The best book I have read over last three months.
030758836X|5.0|This is the best book I've read in years. The author is insanely talented. The way it was written was exceptional. I could not put this book down, character development was amazing and the reader wrestles back and forth questioning WHO is the \\"bad\\" guy. I have never read a book like this before! Excellent. I was with the author until the last few pages and I wasn't too trilled with the ending but the ride getting there was amazing! I hope her other books are just as good!
B000X107GI|5.0|The batteries works... and fine. What else can I say? And Why I'm asked to write more words? Damn you word limit
B008AK8FHM|3.0|As an avid reader with a deep love and curiosity for God and His truth I found this book difficult to put down at times.  Though I have never been a person that ever thought science trumped spiritual concepts, it is interesting to find out how Dr Alexander's views were reshaped by what was without a doubt a profoundly real and honest experience.<br />My only \\"complaint\\" would be that I found the book to be surprisingly vague in sharing the things that the author actually learned while being in God`s Presence.  He just states that<br />he was shown many things but gives very little detail.  For that reason the book hit 3 of 5 stars for me.
B006GH6IS4|5.0|What an amazing documentary. I'll not spoil you. telling something about the video itself, but If you are a fan, you have to watch this<br /><br />Ok, not all the videos are in HD, and clearly some of them could have been &#34;optimized&#34; but c'mon, there are some videos that are so old, that they are better in the original way than scaled.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I did not even cone close to liking this book.  I detested the language, the so-called plot, and the writing in general.  Rowling should stay with her genre and bask in the sun where she deserves to be due to her marvelous harry Potter series, instead of wallow in this muck.
B003QS9WIE|3.0|I liked the movie, but it's not the big deal. However I think there are important things amazon need to do to improve the service, like improve the quality of the streaming, increase the compatibility with devices (I have a Wii and a Toshiba Blue Ray and they are not supported) and finally, add subtitles. Really amazon, subtitles are important!!
B002M87W9K|5.0|I love the music.  I love the actors who play their roles to perfection.  I love being transported to a time that was so much more innocent, yet still loaded with absurdity'  I love the humor.  It is just a fabulous, classic film.<br /><br />1
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A good read with a fairly complex plot. It ended in a very pleasant way with the bad guy getting killed and a new family born from the ashes of fearsome situation.
B0063IH60K|5.0|perfect for those winter days when the suns not out and it is raining. you just cannot beat a good game of solitaire
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The Innocent<br />Good  &#34;edge of the seat&#34; story. Hard to believe that it's probably like that in the real world.<br />My husband will like this one too.
B000FP2OPY|1.0|I watched season one so far, skipping several very cliche and unoriginal story lines. I finally had to stop watching altogether and see what others had to say about this show. I will take the advice of one reviewer and skip to the end of season 2 and get into season 3 if it pulls this lame premise out of the trash can. I am also hoping that the lead actors \\"Sam\\" and \\"Dean\\" mature with the show and demand better writers and stories. If not, I won't be looking forward to seeing them in other shows or movies. I certainly wouldn't buy this series on DVD to add to my collection either, especially with not only what I've seen, but from what others have said about the quality of the music and discs. So far all Supernatural has shown me is poor writing, and a tendency to veer away from smart, intelligent and plausible fiction, heading off into cheap slasher movie mentality instead. A few of the moments which made this show a disappointment were the young woman who is strung up by a \\"ghost\\" in the basement of an abandoned house. I've been on several murder and suicide sites and what was missing in this scene was first a means for the woman to climb up high enough to hang herself and then kick the object out from under herself. Second, any competent coroner would have looked at her shoes to see if there were shards or damage from stepping on her own eyeglasses, a scene which was very prominently displayed in this one story. Granted, the police are not always competent when doing investigations, and I've seen some very badly investigated multiple murders, but this was just SAD. Then there is the young boy who is so terrified of what he has seen on a lake in Wisconsin that he has stopped speaking altogether. Yet, he rushes to the lake for some unknown reason and is taken by the ghost of a boy his own grandfather killed decades prior. All of this story revolves around the boy having died from drowning, and yet again, the other young boy who has witnessed his father being drownedand an attempt on his mother's life, suddenly becomes lake friendly. The mother in turn, smiles so sweetly and radiantly after witnessing her own father dying in the lake. HUH? Granted, it's  Wisconsin and I've seen and experienced some very bizarre behavior in natives there, but this really was a bit over the top. It was like watching the slasher version of The Hardy Boys.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Becouse she can thats WAY! Colleen Hoover bravo this book pulled on every emotion I have I swooned, laughed, cryed and couldnt sleep I read Hopeless in a day and a hafe. I could not put it down, It was beautiful sad and happy all at the same time. Their were times when I was shocked by the things that unfolded. Thinking I did not see that comeing most books are so predictable.<br />Hopeless IS A MUST HAVE BOOK.
0307887960|5.0|My book arrived quickly.  It has been easy to follow the plan with my wife.  We have already found some better ways of eating that actually taste pretty good. We will see he it works out.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie was extremely well done. The actors did a fantastic job, it never felt forced. It was a bit bloody at times, but the story line was so good you hardly realized it. Very authentic to the true story.<br /><br />Highly Recommend. Probably the most under-rated movie in 2012.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|My daughter is super girly and she loves this game.  However, there is a part of the game that appears to require spending some money to buy items in the game.  This part I don't like.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I really don’t think I need to explain why this is a great movie. If you haven’t seen it yet, you really need to. Your social interaction with others pretty much depends on it. If you haven’t seen it because you &#34;heard from a friend that it wasn’t that great.&#34; Get a new friend, because that person should be kicked on the shin. Seriously, see this. It was amazing.<br /><br />Do it. NOW.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I like this ORIGINAL sweeper because the dust bin is easier to clean and I don't need the elbow joint of the later model.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|You will love this. It is a fantastic change from the typical princess role. My son just loves the bears and the hourses, it is a great movie.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book gives a glimpse of a little understood lifestyle. I came to feel compassion for the characters who seem to be scarred. I am anxious to read the next book !!
0765325950|5.0|I used to joke with my stepdad that Jordan would die before he finished the series. My stepdad passed away in 2006, followed by Jordan in 2007. This book, and the two before it that were co-written by Brandon Sanderson, are an awesome and fitting end to this epic story. I laughed with tears running down my face while reading the chapter titled 'The Last Battle'. I felt the loss of the characters but at the same time it was so good and fitting that I was happy to see what happened. I have always read the newest book twice then started from the beginning with Eye of the World, but this will be the first time I get to do that and read the whole story. I will continue to read an recommend a story that I have been reading for over half my life, thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I don't tend to enjoy musicals very much, but the story was centered around singing groups, so the inclusion of musical numbers was not only seamless, but a necessity. I had heard of it as being from the same people who brought us Bridesmaids, but it was definitely much more light-hearted. I was laughing constantly throughout the movie and would highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The book is well written and very innovative. It is very clear to see why this book has become so insanely popular over the last few years. However I was expecting something completely different. I thought the book would be more focused on the actual Hunger Games but *SEMI-SPOILER* it becomes too entangled with a love story. It almost felt, dare I say it, too Twilight-ish. What appeared to be a side love story became the focus of the entire book. It felt as if Collins had changed her mind about what to make of this book about halfway through. The first half of the book is really detailed about life in the Districts, the history behind the Hunger Games, etc. It was pretty interesting stuff. Even the beginning of the Games were pretty well written and intriguing. Once the Games had been going for a while, however, it felt as if Collins decided to reroute the story line and the fact-driven, detail-oriented plot which existed in the first half, disappeared. Some parasitic love story began to consume the once great story. Towards the end it becomes really apparent where entire chunks of time, in what should be a strange land to Katniss, are just forgotten due to her new-found love sickness/obsession. Even though that is a viable reason, the girl is living in poverty at the beginning of the book and at the end she is living the most luxurious of lifestyles YET the only thing she can focus on is some boy from the town which she grew up. Seriously? If I was piss poor one day and suddenly living the life of Donald Trump, I'm pretty sure my love sickness for some chump I grew up with yet never did anything about would subside.<br />Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good love story but the huge focus change really turned me off to the plot. I'm sure my teenage self would have loved it with it's half action/half love story, simple plot, and a teenage angst would have been an instant classic with me. But now I wish it would have focused more on the Games.<br />Overall, if you have a few hours and a few bucks, go for it. In the end everyone's opinion is different. Plus, what harm could come from reading more?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was a late convert to Angry Birds.  It is super fun though, what a great way to ignore those around you and ignore the fact that you should be sleeping instead of playing with tiny digital birds and pigs.
B002MGOWH2|5.0|This film was totally compelling and memorable, impressive in its scope of emotion and story. I had seen it before years ago but was looking forward to seeing it again. As expected, it portrays the brutality of the Nazi regime but also the determination of Adrien Brody's character to survive. His incredible talent as a musician was a theme carried throughout the film as was the support of the Polish people who knew of his gift and made great effort to find sanctuary for him as the story progressed. Wonderful.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|After using the Weather Channel app I remember how websites used to work.  Simple, quick, the information that you actually want not travel deals to South America or Viagra commercials slowing the whole thing down.  If you want quick and easy this is perfect.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|I did not think that this was one of Grisham's best novels. For awhile it moved very slowly. I thought his style was a bit different than usual.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|What can I say Gerrad Butler surprised the heck out of me, still gorgeous even with his face as the Phantom. The talent is extraordinary.

0143117009|4.0|I was really impressed by Jarad Diamond's \\"Collapse\\"  until I read S. M. Newman (2012, 2013) 'Demography, Territory and Law: The Rules of Animal and Human Populations'. Newman is an evolutionary sociologist.  The book examines the whole idea of collapse (including Tainter's) and comes up with a new population theory, which it tests on Rapanui. It shows that the population build up there almost certainly could not have happened and that the fall of Easter Island must have occurred with European contact.<br /><br />As well as Rapanui, which is not the primary focus, 'Demography Territory and Law: The Rules ...' looks at the amazing history of long term survival of Pacific Islands, including Rapanui (3000 years before the 'collapse'); New Guinea and Australia, 40,000 to 60,000.<br /><br />The author does not dispute the danger of collapse for 21st century societies, particularly due to oil depletion and overpopulation, however Newman does dispute the idea that every modern system is incapable of resisting growth and consumerism.  According to Newman, it is the English-speaking industrial societies and their colonial offspring that are out of control.  The Roman or Napoleonic system of continental Europe is able to resist population growth and to control resource consumption. It is not hooked on domestic population and economic growth.  Unfortunately the English and the continental Europeans don't communicate on this and their citizens usually just assume that they have similar systems.<br /><br />Reading Newman's book makes you wonder how Jarad Diamond could not not have known these facts.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|With a whole lot more Sass and singing to boot. But Jesse's hair doesn't look sexy pushed back in this amazing movie.

B0071BGOJC|5.0|I love Ken Follett's books.  He really knows how to keep a reader interested.  I will recommend this book any time.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was not prepared for the depth of this book. I expected a single episode of heroism , instead, i was forced to see and, understand the German side of the war. The horror's that they faced and the death of thier country.  I am the son of a WW2 veteran, born and raised on post, I have never really herd any stories from the German side. A great read. Highly recommend this book.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|I couldn't believe how horrible this was.<br /><br />The movie is only about Princess Merida and her Mother, the other characters are minor. Neither Merida nor her mom knew how to listen to anyone, each always expected to get her own way.<br /><br />Merida is a Princess, a member of the Royal Family.  She sees that as something to escape from.  Royalty are the richest, most connected and most powerful people in her country, and she hates it.<br /><br />Beyond that the movie shows marriage as something to fight against - something to fear and oppose.  It backs up the presumption by having Merida's suitors be physically weak and mentally inadequate - in other words, beneath her.  Beyond that Merida herself chooses the means by which they were supposed to show their worth, and she deliberately chose a means in which she could out do all of them.<br /><br />After that she flees into the forest - runs away from home.<br /><br />Merida meats a Witch in woods and buys a spell.  She wants to curse her own mom.  The curse was on a cake, which turns her mom into a bear.  Afterwards Merida just leaves the cake laying around, she leaves a cursed cake behind.  Which her brothers eventually find and eat.<br /><br />Merida's reaction to the transformation was blame the Witch, she just kept saying \\" It's not my fault\\"  She'd bought the spell, and gave it to her mom, but refused to show responsibility for her actions.<br /><br />Merida then learns that her 3 younger brothers also ate the cake, turning them into bear cubs.  She'd just found out she'd cursed her brothers as well as her mom.  Her reaction was disgusting. she wasn't hurt or afraid or even shocked -  she was angry, at them!  She felt no guilt over what had happened to them.<br /><br />Her dad finds her mom's cloths shredded and her room destroyed, by a bear.  He sets out to avenge his wife.  That should be a great and honorable intent, but the movie's content make it look stupid.  This shows her dad trying to kill his wife, Magic curses or not - that is horrible.  Merida arrives in time to save her mom - Saying \\"I wont let you kill my Mother\\".  She had to fight her dad, that's beyond horrible.<br /><br />At the end Merida broke the curse by, finally, admitting that it had been her fault.  So her suitors were sent away. She cursed most of her family, and nearly got her mom killed - so for that she gets what she'd wanted.  She's rewarded and considered a heroine for just undoing the catastrophe she caused.<br /><br />It's hard to believe children are even allowed to watch this, much less encouraged to.
B002RXZF6C|4.0|Classic storyline told in an old world view... it's an old movie and most won't find it to their liking but I believe the ancient feel only enhances that this story was written by Mary Shelley a long time ago.

B00AJLHUYO|4.0|Most horror/thrillers have a great premise but have a tough time \\"delivering on the promise.\\"<br /><br />SINISTER is a very creepy, slow burn horror film that isn't so much scary (but it is) as suspenseful and when it finally plays its hand at the end, you're in for one of the most unsettling endings to a horror film in years.<br /><br />This is one to own!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I can not wait to read all of the Jack Reacher books.  If it is half as good as this one, I will be happy.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson did a very nice job of finishing Robert Jordan's series. I was impressed how well he tied up the different story lines and plots from the whole series. I almost had tears in my eyes in different parts of the book, and was shouting with enthusiasm in others. His style if writing blended very well with Robert Jordan's almost like Robert Jordan laid a weave of compulsion on Brandon Sanderson and made him write it as he would have wanted him to.<br /><br />Yea, I'll be starting the whole series over again. This is my all time favorite series and this last book only confirms that.

0439813786|5.0|I read The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick in one unbroken sitting: it cast a spell on me that I couldn't walk away from. It is unlike anything I've ever read before. This beautiful piece of art is characterized as \\"a novel in words and picture,\\" and I have no better words to characterize it but to say that it's both legitimately brilliant and genuinely touching. The black and white drawings are gorgeous in their simplicity and intricate detail as they bring to startling life the world of 1931 Paris. It's not only in the tale told, but in the telling of this tale that the wonder, majesty, whimsy, and magic of the early days of film is conjured, as well as the marvel and beauty of childhood innocence. This is a work that must be experienced, not merely read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Purchased as a treat for myself. I am a fan of the series and enjoy the opportunity to review the acting techniques and other technical aspects of the production.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|&#34;Les Mis&#34; is a grand sweeping reading experience. Folks should take time to savor it and not be concerned with page counting.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|We saw this show at a picture theartre and loved it. The Men in Black 3 is more of a comedy than the first 2 in the series.
0765325950|5.0|My wife gave me &#34;The Eye of the World&#34; 20 years ago.  We have traveled in and out of Randland together and are very pleased with how Sanderson finished the story.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|This movie is a remake of War of the Worlds and was quite interesting but very light weight, the action jumped around and was bit hard to follow the sequence in some places.
0345803507|5.0|This trilogy will remain on the coffee tables around the world. The first book started out slow and boring but once you reach the end of each book you found yourself wanting to know more. I like the way the author ended the story with the Male character point of view. I still find myself wanting to know more. I don't think Hollywood will be able to create this journey on the screen in three movies or even do<br />one good movie to highlight the first book. They don't have the talent that could bring the drama and the Heat like the Author, and keep her fans wanting more.

B006ISJQ1W|3.0|Since 2000, Johnny Depp has dominated Hollywood as an actor who fits seamlessly into roles that one would think the characters were written for him specifically.  Of course we are all familiar with the big films such as the POTC franchise, Finding Neverland, and his roles in thee CGI/animated flicks Corpse Bride and Alice in Wonderland.  However, it is some of the smaller, less well-known roles in which Mr. Depp has shown of his acting expertise.  Probably the best one is this adaptation of the book The Rum Diary.  Here, Johnny Depp plays a down-and-out reporter who finds himself in Puerto Rico stumbling from one mishap to another; all the while working on a story to embarrass the ruling class of white American expatriates hiding their wealth on this island.  Through it all, he juggles an illicit romance with the gorgeous Chenault, girlfriend of the island's biggest businessman.  The movie is filled with contrasts in scenery as scenes shift from the urban slums to the tropical beauty of the natural surroundings.  Likewise the dialogue alternates between the drunken complaints of Depp's character, and the polished sales pitches of his antagonist played by Aaron Eckhart.  The soundtrack of the movie is probably the best part, fast, upbeat, tropical with tinges of Caribbean, jazz, African, hip-hop and rock & roll and mixed in.  My primary complaint is the meandering, wondering plot line that often left me bored with the film.  In conclusion, a better than average film that really shows of the skills of Mr. Depp.  However, the story was not to my taste, so I give it 3/5 stars.
0307730697|5.0|This book was a terrific read from beginning to end.  Honest to a fault, it portrays an open and honest look into one of this nations warriors without all of the typical overindulgent fluff, machismo, and self agrandizing so customary to a lot of books in this genre.<br />This guy wasn't just a 'war hero'; more importantly, he was a husband, a father, and a devoted Christian.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The  characters were quite unengaging, the plot was simplistic. The crew members of Promethius attitude to the potential threats of their enterprise was unbelievably casual. The special effects were good, but the growth and metabolism of the aliens was not at all credible as their food sources were insufficient to provide the energy required, even if they had fantastically efficient metabolisms. The producer tried too hard to incorporate all the elements of aliens depicted in previous films,- less detail and more ambiguity would have been more effective and convincing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I get so hooked on the chapter's that I just can't stop reading the book. Now I'm on to the next one
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|All I can say is that this book was GREAT!  I loved it.  It took me by surprise in many ways.  I would suggest this book to my friends.
B00ANT6OK8|3.0|This is a good film that is entertaining but spoiled by the lead character Maya.I really don't even care if she is a<br />real person,which apparently she isn't.Maya is a very annoying woman who doesn't engage the viewer to root for her at all.<br />I won't get into the whole plot but the line which shows it best is Maya saying to a Navy Seal,a man that puts<br />his life on the line everyday and is a real hero,Bin Laden is there and your going to kill him for me.How can we as an audience root for this women when it is all about her?<br />It's no wonder Kathryn Bigelow wasn't nominated for an Oscar for best director,she doesn't deserve it.This movie would have been so much better if they had the male CIA officer Dan as the main character.He leads the waterboarding of the terrorists at the beginning of the movie ,which actually leads to the capture of Bin Laden.He is a much more interesting character and would have propelled the movie forward at a far more exciting pace than the boring Maya character.<br />It is still a very entertaining movie but does not deserve the Oscar for best picture or best actress.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My son loves this game. It has great graphics and so many things you can do. I was hoping it would be a little easier for younger kids to use but still a great game.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|THIS CD IS GREAT. SINGS GREAT WITH OTHERS AND ALONE. I PASSED IT ON AFTER I MADE MY COPY EVERYONE HAS SAID IT'S COOL,
B009P25TQE|5.0|I really like his music and this CD was no exception to that. It has some really awesome songs, some that really make you move and others that are slow and romantic. He is one really talented young singer.
1400049628|5.0|What to say it's a good read, couldnt put it down. Deff worth buying, so are his other books. That is all.
B001AQO3WY|4.0|I got this BluRay set for Christmas and I love the series.  However, my complaint is with the BluRay itself.  Every time you put the disk into my player, you have to sit through HBO's commercials about crappy shows.  Hi, I own these discs, stop trying to sell me other stuff.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|I would recommend this product to my colleagues, friends, and even enemies. It shows negotiation not as a war on upper hands but a partnership towards a win-win end goal.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game. I love horses and used to have a pair when I was a kid. It makes me think about them when I play this game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|There are many Solitaire games available today.  This one surpasses any that I have played.  The cards move quickly and the scoring is accurate.  I totally recommend this game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app works just as it should and has a nice layout.  weather alerts are a really nice touch. very happy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great way to pass time I love how great the graphics are! it's cute and I think it's worth it
B009K0P10K|1.0|I saw season one and I love this serie but the technical problems don't alow me to see this episode. I bought and I never can't see it..<br />BIG TECHNICAL PROBLEMS....Bad review but for amazon instant video....doesn't work at all!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just enjoy his style of writing. I've read all his books and they are all good reads. The only negative I would say is that<br />he is a little bit predictable. I have recomended this book to my daughter as I have all his books.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This app is fun and stuff. One two huge going light fights long lighten listed ominously length invite omni it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Hubby and I found this movie to be quite funny.  We enjoy watching The Voice and The Sing Off so this fell right in line with those and Rebel Wilson is just hilarious!  I was pleasantly surprised that Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow can actually sing.  The movie kept our attention and kept us laughing.  It definitely deserved it's PG13 rating and is definitely not appropriate for my 10 year old...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted! So easy to access on my computer and not too many commercials. I just wish my TV was able to show it.
B001OQCV6K|2.0|The case was smashed to where it can't be used, I would have been fine with it if I knew the condition of the product going into it but as it were I wasn't happy with it's condition.
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|Contents are wonderful but you have to take a test at the end and it wasn't in there.  You needed a code to do that and I didn't know it.  So now I have purchase another book so my son can have a code so he can take the test -- which very crucial.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|it was like a family guy episode. a few zingers, but mostly it fell flat for me. perhaps you need to be stoned.
B003ZFCBJ0|4.0|It came from life reality. So bad the quality of the picture was not great all the time and connection was bad sometimes.
1932100660|5.0|This is a great book for someone with an open mind who is ready to consider changing their diet to improve their health and avoid disease (and stop taking an unnecessary statin medication). Dr. Campbell backs up much of what he proposes with solid research. I read the book on an e-reader, and was frustrated at times because I was unable to appreciate the many graphs and visuals that illustrate main points. You will get much more out of this excellent book if you order the paperback.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am glad that I found this app. I tried several out and this one is the best!! Its easy to play!
B00992CF6W|1.0|probably will never have another update. I bate that. it is just a scam to get you to want to get the real computer minecraft.
1451695195|5.0|One of the best books on the topic.  Considering that scientists have a tendency not to ackowledge topics which can not be proven scientifically, Dr. Alexander, a neurologist himself, has been able to convey and explain the existance of spirit and God  in a convincing manner for all to unserstand.
B009MF56GC|4.0|Unfortunately I have not watched it yet, but it was a must have since we enjoyed the first Expendables.  Will have to update once we watch it.
B005QUQ99K|4.0|Ninjago was HIGH on the priority list for Santa this year.  Loves this toy, but would make it a bit more difficult to deconstruct.  In my personal opinion, Legos should come with super glue for the non moving parts.  It is very frustrating to have to redo each piece when it comes off.  Other than that, my 5 year old really enjoys this toy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics,but a little confusing for me. A lot of individual puzzle games a cool extra..it 's keeping me occupied for now. I just downloaded it so I really haven't gotten into it too heavy yet ...Ok so far though. Would recommend it.
1592402038|4.0|I like this book. It's a bit boring bc it's grammar but, the humor makes up for it. It's made me open my eyes to the point where i am registering for a grammar course to turn my writing up a notch. Grammar in schools is not pushed onto students. This worris Truss about the present and future. I want to show her that there is still hope!
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I bought this book because I had read others in the series, and wanted to know how it got started.  Great plot, great read. I can honestly say I have now read the entire series, and although all of the books are stand alone a lot of loose threads have been drawn together by reading all of the Camel Club books.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'm the slowest reader and I finished this in 5 hours and 40 min. Over two days. The writing is beautiful and challenging. The story is strong and humorous yet tragic. I loved it.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I have read almost all of the Doyle books before, but having the entire series at my fingertips is great.  Hard to believe that these stories were written in th 1890's.  Thanks for offering this collection.
630463949X|5.0|If you haven't seen this video you must.  I listen to this all the time.  I watched when they had USC marching band perform.  It was so awesome. You can feel the energy.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|my daily schedule for work and life is different every day therefore I end up living by alarms had other apps but this one is much more customizable
B001NZEHMS|5.0|... it's time to get ill!!  Duh!!  Best album ever!  So many classics that are all a part of the soundtrack of my youth!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this so much it's so addicting. How do people come up with ideas like this? Also read the one star reviews how this app &quot;stole&quot; their money. It's your fault for allowing your children to buy stuff people! =\
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun way for my four year old to problem solve and work on his hand/eye coordination.  Great game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much that I am addicted to it.It is so fun and easy to play.I think that everyone should try it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I look forward to the third book. I don't read a lot of sequel type stories while this was a good second book I really hope the third one is great!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I decided to read this because my older and younger brother recommended it. I did not think I would like it but it was very clever and it helped me understand how a shepherd thinks. Understanding that helps me to understand a lot of how Christ describes God in the bible. I can see why it is translated into so many languages. I love the clever ending.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Great game been playing for hours. If you don't have time though don't download it requires a lot of time.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was a book my son was reading at school and had forgotten his book so we downloaded it on his iPad on the Kindle app.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Very awesome headset. sort of an easy set up really need a new system with hd cords so be ready to buy a new hd cord if you have the old Xbox but really great buy if your a real hardcore gamer it has awesome sound with 8 different sound options to choose from for your likeing and 8 different chat options also including 3 voice changers also coming with a USB that hooks up to your Xbox for charging the headset and all the buttons are on each ear cuff (sound and voice option buttons on the left and chat options on the right ear cuff) and all you have to do is push one button for the sound and another for chat options all you have to do is cycle through 1-8 for one of yor likeing. Overall awesome headset
B003CSV7TK|5.0|...found a black and white version for my wife.  We watched it Christmas night.  There was quite a bit I'd forgotten.
1451695195|5.0|This NDE description is outstanding because it describes an NDE extending DAYS, not a minute or two.  What gives this story strength is that it's written by a no-nonsense successful neurosurgeon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game! Has many great features. Enjoy all of the options. It is so fun to play. Sometimes I find it difficult to stop playing. I also installed it on my cellphone.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a great book!! It really gives you a great perspective from a dog's point of view! I suggest you read this book!!!!
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|For any of you who admire really good talent...from an incredible person, order this DVD....wonderful music shared by Tony with many top name contemporary singers....a delightful audio experience....highly recommend!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is amazing. Love it! Highly recommend folks to start watching this show, it's a delight! Well work the money.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be differ but it turn out better,a little dark but still a must see,
B00364K6YW|5.0|Classic BBC version well restored and almost HD in appearance.  Great version at a great price - every Austen needs this version.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book(s).  I thought the first entry was a little slow (not to hate) but that the it really picked up afterwards.  I wouldn't say that this is 5 books, more like 2.5 as the first 2 are about 30 pages each.  As I'm sure you have gathered from other reviewers (and if you haven't you can't read and shouldn't be buying books), it is a dystopian future where they have to stay inside silos and the outdoors is not safe, blah blah blah.  The characters are well-constructed and the dialogue is enjoyable.  I read this in about a week and quickly bought books 6 and 7 and finished in a few days.  Very addictive once you get going, similar to a good fix, not that I would know what that is like.  H-squared is a better writer than the Veronica Roths and Suzanne Collins of the world, so more power to him.<br /><br />My few problems are mainly with the social structure.  Why are they only allowed to be in \\"official\\" sanctioned relationships?  I would think that if I was locked up in a silo for my whole life I'd at least want to catch a few std's to make my life more entertaining.  Special Silo-strands, now that is what I'm talking.  Unleash the Jersey Shore cast on these squares.  Not like they can just plug into their xbox without a care in the world for a few hours.  Wouldn't there evolve a major brothel culture?  A man has to get his d wet.  It is known.<br /><br />Also, since Hugh Howey admitted in the end of the book that he loves reading his amazon reviews - What up Hugh?  Shoutout from NYC.  Holla at me.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|Wonderful behind the scenes look at the man and band that have spoken to me with their songs for decades.  At times I was moved to tears as John revealed his inner demons.  It seems to ring true yet again that fame and fortune do not guarantee happiness.  A must read for anyone who has lived through the decadence of the 80's.
B001W6RRNY|5.0|I only recently read this book so that I could go through the entire series.  The analysis in this book contains enduring principles about visionary companies and their cultures that you will find helpful in business, even though it was written years ago.
B009A87X80|5.0|Eva Cassidy is a local girl from Maryland. Tragically she passed away in her 30's but left a voice that sounds like an angel and very strong.  I would recommend this CD.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So far, Season 3 has not disappointed me.  The streaming quality of this video via Amazon was excellent as well.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|This is a great movie when you look at it from a perspective of all different types of love. I completely enjoy it. The actors are wonderful and story lines (sub plots everywhere) are both funny and heartfelt. I would recommend this to any adult. Not for children to observe though. Too much adult matter in it. Nonetheless, a good movie. The sounddtrack is great as well.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|It was boring, I fell asleep at one point. A poorly conceived and very poorly executed project. I would not recommend this picture to anyone. Yet another piece of trash hyped for box office numbers, with no redeeming value what so ever.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A must see if up for good fun laughs. My wife and I couldn't stop laughing. Just take some time out of your life and watch the flick.
0765367297|5.0|My son loves the book, he is actual reading which i love and he gets to use it for his book report
0670026603|5.0|I hadn't read any of Jojo Moyes' work previously and I'll confess that when I picked up Me Before You I expected something pretty fluffy and fun. That in itself would have been fine - I enjoy chick lit and a bit of gushiness. Me Before You, however, goes way beyond generating a touch of emotion - it's a rollercoaster of thoughts, feelings and questions.<br /><br />Will Traynor is a young man who had it all: the job, the girl, the adventures. When an accident leaves him paralysed and totally reliant on others to help him cope with day to day life, it's more than he can bear. By contrast, Lou Clark has the boy - who she isn't sure she loves, no job, the spare box room at her parents' house. What she does have is an infectious spirit of fight and determination.<br /><br />The relationship between Will and his new carer/companion Lou is a difficult one, complicated by interventions from Will's mother and Lou's boyfriend. However, despite the circumstances and their very different outlooks and personalities, a beautiful friendship develops between the two allowing us to see the best of both of them.<br /><br />It is not all happy. There are moments of extreme sadness - I haven't cried so much since I read The Time Traveler's Wife - but there are also wonderful moments of hope and inspiration. This book will make you think and ask yourself `What would I do?', `Could I do that?', `How would I cope?'. It is all the more poignant for that. You don't read this story, you feel it. In my case, I stayed up until 6 a.m. to finish it after deciding to read `a few pages' earlier in the night. It's one of the best uses of a lost night's sleep I've ever had.<br /><br />**I received a copy via Netgalley in exchange for a fair and honest review.**
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Loved how the book flushed out characters from seeing the movie or musical. Too much detail about peripheral events. Story should be about the characters,  lessen the background.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The plot is well laid out, keeping you guessing. The characters are all accessible and easy to empathise with. Suicide is still a very taboo topic even in this 21st century and we do not know and never will know why suicides happen in 90% of cases. Something is lacking in society - I cannot put it into concise words, but not only with teens, but with anyone - the &#34;need&#34;to end ones life can trul;y appear to be the only solution and we, society must when in doubt, actively invade people's hearts and minds to check whether they are truly ok. Jodi Picoult is a true story teller with a message(s) in every novel.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Came to life for me, I know it was just a story but I fell in love with Sadea  and wanted it to work out with her &George r should I say Jake
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Great game to play with my 5 yr old. She loves it an  if keeps her busy on car rides.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Wouldnt download and then finally downloaded but had to change language and had to start download over again multiple times
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's like paying the old carnival game. As you acquire more prizes and puzzle pieces, the game leaves you wanting more.At a point, you will only be able to collect coins and more prizes and not be able to complete any more puzzles.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first time to read this author.  I kept hearing good things and decided to try the book.  I enjoyed it very much.  I wasn't crazy about the ending but couldn't come up with anything I would have considered better.  I am now going to read one of the other books.
B001P3SA94|5.0|The music was great and the actors and actresses played their roles with excellence. Beyonce was amazing in her role as Etta James. This is a movie I could watch over and over.
B004R2DS9C|5.0|This is perfect for lego storage. It's cute, easy to carry and makes clean up even easier.<br /><br />We have a good amount of Lego sets and this holds them well. I think the size is great, not too small but not obnoxiously large either.
B00A6RVRXG|4.0|From the opening track \\"Ohm,\\" to the fine closer, YLT employs a cleaner sound and more vocal-friendly mix than on any previous release. At first this was somewhar jarring, though in the long run it does a better job in regards, especially, to Georgia's voice. Nice arrangments, fun playing, a highlight of early 2013.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I only wish it took PNG and had green enhancement, which fortunately the other app with the ladybug has, but otherwise for ease of use, this is one of my favorites.  A real workhorse for basic fixes and some cool F/X.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is so creative and different for me that I can't help but enjoy it, but then the game play is really fun too. I love seeing my little guy running around with his umbrella interacting with the levels and other creatures. Definitely one of the best games I've played in a while. Simple but challenging and novel to boot.
B002UNMW7O|2.0|Several of the options on the DVD were not available whe I tried to look at then. The movie alone was good.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I actually wrote a lenghtly review for this book, but apearently i forgot to send it. I won't try to rewrite it. This will be a shorter version.<br /><br />Firstly, from what i read from Mr. Rice's paranormal fantasy series' reviews, she's an accomplished paranormal romance writer. Maybe one day i'll check those books. But i gotta say. She is not a good epic fantasy writer. Actually \\"A Quest of Heroes\\" felt to me like a paranormal fantasy book pretending to be epic fantasy.  Why? Here is some of the reasons:<br /><br />-First and foremost is the authors incredible lack of medieval culture knowledge(especially in matters of warfare) I'll come back to this later on.<br /><br />-Timeframe. This whole book actually takes place in a week. There is no way any epic fantasy series' first book can be that compressed. By it's definition, epic fantasy is about taking a country bumpkin and training him to be a great hero. Key work being \\"training\\". In AQoH Mrs. Rice actually puts our bumpkin in some sort of military boot camp for training but for reasons unknown, just after one day of \\"training\\" she takes him out and goes on with the story. Actually in day 2 said military organisation sends our guy to \\"patrol\\" the most dangerious place in the whole world.<br /><br />-Again by definition of genre; our bumpkin has to become great at one point in the story. From what we have seen so far, by the end of book #1 our guy is as great as he was at the begining. Author hints at some magical power he posseses. What they might be? I have no idea. As far as i can see only great skill he posseses is an incredibly accurate sling. Hardly fitting to a great hero i'd say.<br /><br />-Worldbuilding is lacking. I admit it could have been way worse. But not being the worst shouldn't be a thing to celebrate. World' geography and political situation is unbelievibly simplified. In a nutshell, our guy lives in a ring shaped land divided in two by opposing kingdoms, said ring is surrounded and cut out from rest of the world by unpassable mountains and only pass that connects big bad world and the ring is protected by some sort of magical barrier. Am i the only one who finds such a geography quite unbelieveble?<br /><br />Anyway lets get to fun part. Medieval warfare. There are just so many errors, listing them all would take a day. So i'll just give you a few funny examples.<br /><br />-\\"He set it down and picked up a mace, a studded metal ball attached to a short staff by a long chain\\" What is described here is a flail not a mace.<br /><br />-Mrs. Rice obviously have a thing(almost a fetish) for thrown weapons. There is a training in witch our heroe learns how to throw swords, spears, maces, heck even shields to targets 30 feet away. Mrs. Rice; no matter how cool they'd look when thrown; none of those weapons are throwable. Swords' balance is always at the hilt, so if you were to throw it; it would never hit the target point first. You don't throw spears, you toss javelins. To know this you don't need to be a medieval history buff, just watch olympic games once in every four years. Maces, just like spears are too heavy to be trown at 30 paces. I won't even tell why you can't(and shouldn't) throw away your shield. It is not a frisbee for crying out loud.<br /><br />-\\"Which weapons will you need,sire?\\" Thor asked.<br /> \\"It's hard to anticipate what battles i might encounter throughout a year. But i need to be able to hunt, and defend myself. So of course i need my longsword. I also should bring my shortsword, a bow a quiver of arrows, a short spear, a mace, a dagger, and my shield. I suspect that will do\\" As a side note: this guy has a full plate armour and barding on his horse.<br /> When i read this, i was like: \\"Wait you sould also bring a siege tower and a catapult. There might be a castle in need of conquering along the way\\". I guess this is actually a worldbuilding issue. Mrs. Rice forgot to mention in this world they use elephants in place of horses.<br /><br />-Our boy Thor has a stange habit to call everyone by titles like \\"My liege\\" and \\"Sire\\" even the guards at the city gates. I guess no one has tought him you should only call your actual liege lord(or his liege lord) by that title or else you might loose your head.<br /><br />Ok, enough fun. Lets get to my main gripe with this book. It's the product description on Amazon.<br /><br />\\"A breathtaking new epic fantasy series. Morgan Rice does it again! This magical saga reminds me of the best of J.K. Rowling, George R.R. Martin, Rick Riordan, Christopher Paolini and J.R.R. Tolkien. I couldn't put it down!\\"<br />--Allegra Skye, Bestselling author of SAVED<br /><br />I don't know who Allegra Skye is, but i definitely won't read anything by her. Comparing this book to A Song of Ice and Fire books is bad enough, throwing Tolkien's name in the mix is nearing blasphemy. But claiming this book containing \\"the best of\\" said works... It's just wrong. Shame on you Mrs Skye. Of all those names, only Eragon by C. Paolini might be compared to this book. And even that is streching things...<br /><br />Darn, i was trying to write a short review this time around. Guess it didn't happen. Oh well... Anyways my final verdict: If you are a newcomer to fantasy genre(and especially if you came from paranormal) this book might be for you. If you are a long time epic/high fantasy reader like me, and especially if you read any of those aforementioned authors before. Don't bother with this book. It'll leave you unsatisfied.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Great read. Nice because it is light reading but still entertaining and thought provoking. Would definitely recommend it for anyone.
B00932A5QA|5.0|Great formatting of the original film of Starship Troopers. Storyboards must have been interesting to develop for this anime film
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A book for all times and all tastes.<br />Be smart, read it!, you wouldn´t regret.<br />have a thesaurus with you.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I WATCHED THE MOVIE FIRST. A VERY BAD MISTAKE BECUASE I COLDN'T ENDURE WATCHING A SECOND TIME. TOO MUCH REALITY NOT PRESENT IN THE MOVIE. THE BOOK WILL BE MUCH BETTER. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE BOOK IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER, CANT WAIT  SINCE I HAVE IT NOW.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|In a loud and somewhat chaotic sea of life I get to sit on my little island of downtown abbey every Sunday nite and bask in the warm sunshine of these lovely stories.  So far season 3 has lived up to its predecessors, giving me both the beautifully sweet and the ugly sordid sides of life in post WW iii Britain.  But please somebody come on and marry poor darling Edith soon!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I LOVED THE KENDAL VERSION I RECEIVED AND READ ON MY IPHONE. A VERY GOOD BOOK TO READ. I WILL GET THE HARD COVER FOR MY COLLECTION AND SKIP THE MOVIE AFTER READING THE BOOK.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|I received this game for free yesterday, and it's been a blast to play! I love the art direction that was utilized for \\"From Cheese\\"... it's bright, colorful, and super cute. I love the mouse protagonist, and I enjoy helping him to satisfy his insatiable cheese-lust!<br /><br />The game is relatively easy to get into, providing just the right amount of challenge to stimulate the mind, without becoming frustrating. For perfectionists, there is quite a bit that can be done, attempting to repeat levels to get the best rating (three stars). There are quite a few levels, and the replay value should be relatively high for \\"From Cheese\\".<br /><br />I would probably rate this game four stars, based on its content. However, the fact that there have been no annoying pleas for money (in game purchases) or begging me to connect to facebook/twitter goes a LONG way in my eyes, and that bumps this fun game up to five stars!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I am completely addicted to Amazon. I take my tablet to bed an check reviews on products until I fall asleep. Amaon has really helped me save money and make better buying decisions.
B009O2XY12|2.0|I thought it was the game I play at Chilli's and I really did not like this one at all.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It is very frustrating to be put back at the beginning of the news feed everytime you want to comment on somebody's post.
B004LWZW7O|3.0|This is an awesome dystopian future sci-fi film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, outside of the initial setup, the story itself was pretty lackluster.  On top of that, the acting was so bad it felt like a 70's adult film.  I was expecting the clothes to drop at any moment.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:  The clothes stay on.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Good but no great. To many unnecessary events which seemed to just take up space.  Would have been a good short story rather than a novel.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Book was recommended.  Have read King before, but usually in broad day light when I could check under the bed!  This book is different and a VERY good read.  His style of writing is the same but the book content is unusual and on a subject some of us, who actually can remember Kennedy's death, have probably thought about and wished it could have been reversed!
B0091XRL0E|4.0|The animation is excellent and the absurd story is funny and moves along well. My 7 and 12 year-olds thought really enjoyed it.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I bought this on the Christmas sale for really cheap because I heard one of their songs on the radio that I mildy enjoyed.<br />All I can say is GREAT PURCHASE.  I love this album.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|How can you not want to see how things turn out in the war and life of these characters?  The whole series was expertly crafted.  Bravo.
B004LP3AYI|3.0|This is a book that wants to be great, but the author just wont it let it get there. Now, before anyone rips my head off, I do have reasons.<br /><br />Good:<br />1) The characters are compelling. I enjoy all of them, and they're a lot of fun to keep up with.<br />2) While the story line has a lot of predictability, I'm still not bored by it. It keeps things fun.<br />3) It's a long series. I always hate when it ends too short or I don't have more to read. There is a lot of content.<br /><br />Bad:<br />1) Editing. Lots of misspelling, incorrect word usage (than vs that, etc), incorrect paragraph spacing, incorrect dialogue spacing, the list goes on. Some of this is from being digitized to kindle, but that's even more of a reason to CONTINUE EDITING for a polished product. It's not like they have to print new copies, just update what we already have.<br />2) Repetitive. The dialogue repeats itself incessantly and I simply can't stand it. How many times does a character need to say the same thing WITHIN the same conversation? It's terrible. (I find myself having to skim, and I don't like doing that).<br />3) Sense of scale. Sometimes I can't believe how out of scale things seem to be. Palaces that fit within staircases? Things that simply can't be done, and have promised to change and then do so in an instant? Personality changes that flip flop within moments of talking? The progression simply isn't good.<br /><br />This series, from what I have read so far, has potential greatness. If it was re-written to change some of these problems, I would rank it among some of the finest stories I have had the fortune to enjoy. I really hope that these problems to not persist through the rest of the series, but I have a sneaking suspicion that they do. If you can manage to get past these problems, which I try to on every page, it is still an enjoyable read.
B0095R64AO|1.0|This felt like a 5 year movie.... It was not funny and it dragged on and on. It was really bad!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book has got it all: mystery, suspense, good plot, and possible an interesting message. This is definitely a book worth reading.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|As a 2013 Thriller and compared with Thirty Dark Zero, it is less brutal. A bit dorky at times but highlights how the West does NOT understand the East. We are seeing a lot more movies based in the Middle East and the issues that arise with our 'invasion.' This movie is well worth watching if you're seeking to 'feel' for the actors and keep yourself on the edge for a night!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love when I cannot see the ending and I could not until the end.  Recommend to any mystery readers.  I could not put it down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was told about the series from a friend of mine and convinced that I had to reqad it. I was ensured that I would love it and everyone that told me that was right I was. I could not put the books down they were that good!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I normally do not write reviews (even though I have bought about 1000 Kindle titles) because I just don't bother.  This time I had to.  I see all these 1 star reviews and read them and I am like WHAT?  The reason the book is a best seller etc.. is NOT the sex in it.  In fact every bad review almost focuses on the sex scenes and completely misses the point of the story.  This is a beautiful love story about redemption, learning to love yourself, learning to trust etc...<br /><br />The two main characters are both \\"messed up\\" by their childhoods.  The man (Christian) is VERY messed up and the girl (Ana) is moderately messed up.  Neither of them have any sense of self worth.  In the start Christian's ONLY means of human touch and interaction is through sexual acts.  He tries to go this route with Ana when he meets her and is attracted to her and it just does not \\"work\\".  Honestly, you could skip most of the sex scenes and still have such a beautiful love story.<br /><br />These books are NOT really about BDSM or sex, they are about LOVE and how it can change us and make us more.  I personally did not find all the bondage sex scenes that \\"hot\\" or whatever, but for me that did not detract from the book at all.  I can see why she put it all in there.  It is the ONLY way the main character \\"knows\\" how to have any type of relationship.  I think it is beautiful how you see him \\"blossom\\" from this harsh, closed in, sad and lonely man into someone who knows he is worthy of love and accepts it.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that anyone should give the books a try.  Do not read them thinking oh sex sex sex.... Take the time to think about the characters underneath all the sex.  Then you will be in for a treat!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was told about the series from a friend of mine and convinced that I had to reqad it. I was ensured that I would love it and everyone that told me that was right I was. I could not put the books down they were that good!
B007SGM084|5.0|Write more!<br />I loved it and now you have left me wanting more!!  I can't wait for more!  Thank you!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I first heard about this book I wasnt sure it was something that I myself would want to read but I was convinced to get it and so I did. I started the first book and finished it in 2 days it was that good and I just could not put it down
B008I43DYU|5.0|The fact that it goes up to 15 digits is wonderful in this day and time.  I can better explain to those that have a hard time comprehending just what a &#34;trillion&#34; is. Our country's current leadership obviously does not understand.  Maybe this would be beneficial to them as well.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This case is great for travel, but it takes up more room than I it would have liked it to.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved it!!!<br />I couldn't put it down. The last one was a little slower then the first but I still couldn't put it down.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|This is a game I am trying to learn.  Learning is hard at my age.  I have not use it much
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is the most amazing book i've ever read!!! I cant wait to finish the series!! This is a must read book!!
B0020BUWX2|1.0|You have got to be kidding me! I was soon going to let my daughter read this , but I couldn't possibly do this to her! Ugh!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a really good book. Some parts are sad because that should happen to any one  and some parts you feel like everyone should have someone like holder to just be there for them.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has produced another enrapturing story! Always a joy to get lost in his stories! This is another hit!
B000001Y79|5.0|This is one of the music recordings I go back to over and over throughout the years.  I like all kinds of music and really like some great female rock singers.  Gwen Stefani combined with the rest of No Doubt during this period of their musical careers had something special going in my opinion.  Just enough punk, just enough rock and incredible songwriting and performance.  &#34;No Doubt&#34; not for every one (pardon the pun) but if you like the samples you'll love the full recordings.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This book did not live up to the hype. Parts of the story were hard to follow, but overall, not too bad.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Perfect for mounting your maglite to the wall.  I have two of these lights mounted to walls at my house and always know exactly where to get a light when I need it.  Quality is great and would recommend these to anyone that are interested in this type of holder for there Maglite.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love it! Lots of fun for kids, niece can play it all the time. Teaches some responsibility to young ones
B007URVZJ6|5.0|ebooks are now the rage, so Kindle's own how to book hits the mark. I epublished using this book. Thanks.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Very well written and riveting. Ever so slightly predictable but still very much worth the read.  I read it in two days. It will hold your interest the whole time.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I read this book quickly and it didn't make a big impression on me. I am glad I purchased it, though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love reading this book, it has a real good story line it's not just all about the sex. The base if this story is really good and I would recommend anyone that likes to read. To definitely read this series.....
0823004325|5.0|As a beginning artist, I looked may places to find a resource like this. Faces and expressions are detailed, giving muscular and emotions aspect of expressions. I bought a second copy as a gift.
0517548232|5.0|Mr. Hazlitt has done an amazing job of removing the mystery surrounding economics. Don't let his straightforward style of writing mislead you; his analysis is impeccable, and this book continues to be relevant today, though originally published in 1946. This is a timeless work that is desperately needed, especially in this current hour as our elected leadership wrestles with a tough economy.
B007EECSFA|5.0|My aunt recommended this book and said there was a twist and turn I wouldn't see coming. She was right! It was so worth the read, seven in the slower parts!
0425252868|5.0|A great book, Even at a war, there is value and honor, things we are missing on our present days.
0385535147|2.0|It's difficult to explain the 2 star rating without giving away any details of the plot, but in no way can this be considered to be a good novel, much less a great one.  The first half of the novel is generally a gripping read filled with interesting details on the background of how the main character (Malcolm Bannister) has gotten to where he has in life.  As some previous reviews have alluded to, this is in essence a revenge novel along the lines of Count of Monte Cristo, and as you rip through the first half you truly think there must be great things at hand for the rest of the novel.  It's John Grisham - what could possibly go wrong, right?<br /><br />Then...., the second half started.  The gross over-sexualization of the only female character of note was annoying, the insanely over the top plot machinations that were revealed as part of the revenge plot were clumsy, the ridiculously minute details regarding banks was yawn-inducing and every single character ended up being one that I hated. Last, but not least, it might have been one of the weakest conclusions to a book I've ever read.  I flipped back on my kindle three times because I was convinced that couldn't be it.  And then Grisham's flip author's note about how he hadn't bothered researching anything was just infuriating because it made me think he wrote lazily because he knew the book would make money because of his name.<br /><br />In conclusion, borrow - do not buy - this book and read it for what it is.  Pure delusional revenge fantasy that has no basis in reality, no fully formed characters beyond the main one, insane plot twists that leave you confused until fifty pages further (at which point there will be another fifteen twists that have been detailed) and one of the weakest endings in modern novel history.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|excellent! I had been waiting to see this movie and bought it on sale. Well worth the $5 I paid for it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Seems to work very well and appears to be as accurate as is possible. lots of information shown on main page.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was a great movie the only thing i did not like was how expensive it was to rent. Thanks
1400063515|4.0|A number of reviews have indicated that the core idea of the book could be boiled down into something much shorter.  If the Cliff Notes version is what you want, you can get it off of Wikipedia.  The value of a longer treatment is to capture nuance, which Taleb does well -- although it may seem at times he is contradicting himself.  Whatever you may think of the ideas in this book, which if you haven't read it are more complex than what you have encountered in the many short-form retellings, they have been sufficiently influential to warrant some knowledge of them.  The book is written well and in a sufficiently entertaining manner to make reading it not too burdensome.  I do concur somewhat with other reviewers who have found Taleb a little full of himself.  But this aspect doesn't change the value of reading this book.
B006RXQ0JO|4.0|Great movie. Watched for the second time and still felt the anxiety and tension pouring from the great cast, great direction.
B00574P9EQ|3.0|its okay I just think for kids watching that they shouldnt have the boy running around with out cloths on.
0765325950|4.0|Too many years waiting for this book.  The plots are woven back together and the end arrives.  The battles are brushed over in many cases with armies abruptly moving from place to place but the individual conflicts are well handled.  I like the ending and the way that major characters are resolved.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|it was a good move. i want to watch it agian so do my kids. I think we all raedy watched 6 times.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|sanderson has a knack for reinventing the way fantasy worlds are made.  He takes the magic that we know from scifj fantasy and reengineers how it works in a new and creative way.  I really enjoyed this book.  It made a quick and fun read that left me wanting more from the character.
B000001OAA|4.0|Very new back then when it was released. Still a great album! Have on my Ipod and play it regularly.
B001NFT3Z4|5.0|Whether it's your first or 10th time to watch it, it is a funny movie. Very well acted and the 'snake monster' was pretty good too.

B003JTHXN6|5.0|Simple. Communicative.  Positive.  Purposeful. A thought provoking business must-read for entrepreneurs and dreamers alike.  Intoxicating vision of the future of business.  His parents should be proud.

0060734191|4.0|Garth Nix's Old Kingdom Trilogy, known here in the states as the Abhorsen Trilogy is an intriguing case study in how to tell a story with Necromancy.  He developed all kinds of intriguing words such as Astarael, Mosrael, Mordicant, and Sabriel; the last of which caught my eye on the book sleeve and led me to collect the books and read them.<br />I have no doubt that Mr. Nix is an inventive author, and he strung me along with many world building devices that were intriguing, mysterious, and strange.  Unfortunately the more I read, the flimsier the story became.  The inventive streak within this book series is, quite frankly, underwhelmed by the lack of creative imagination that would vault this title's narrative to the same rarified success as the crowd pleasing Harry Potter, or the grand, sweeping, epic of Lord of the Rings.<br />But; if you can prepare yourself for what feels like a smaller narrative, there is a world to be found here that is bursting with vision, grand designs, partially realized concepts, and excellent female leads.<br />The energetic pacing and world building within this book are within a hairs breadth of excellence.  If you can live with a story lacking in narrative magic, you will find that there is more than enough magic to be found in the characters and customs of this trilogy.<br /><br />In short, better written stories with sounder plots can be found elsewhere, but if you want to experience a world wholly different and intriguing by its own merits you can be assured of finding it in the Old Kingdom.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|... an average Johnny Depp. He acts the same way as in all his other (popular) movies.<br />On the other hand we have a fantastic Eva Green. She, and the visuals, are the main attraction of this movie.<br />The FX, costumes and sets are brilliant, but in the end, there is nothing really new here.<br />So, in a way it is disappointing, but I like the movie nonetheless. Tim Burton proves again that he is the best living (visual) director.<br />The BLU-RAY is excellent, with a PERFECT image quality, just the way this movie should be watched!
B007HACDLK|5.0|It was breathtaking!  I loved it from the first page to the last.  Vince Flynn is one of my favorite writers.
0679720200|2.0|So we have this guy who sort of muddles through life doing whatever comes to mind. He meets a girl and she asks him to marry her... sure why not?  He meets a thug and the thug asks him to be his pal... sure why not? The thug asks him to write a nasty letter to his ex lover, so he can get even with her...sure why not?  He goes with the thug to meet a friend...sure why not? The thug gets into a fight with his ex lover brother and asks him to hold a gun on him... sure why not. Later he goes for a walk on the beach and gets dizzy from the sun and runs into the brother and, since he has a burning need of a cool place(where the brother happens to be sitting) he confronts him. The brother pulls a knife and so he shoots him five times<br /><br />OK now the part about the lawyer... He is arrested and put on trial. He gets a lawyer to defend him who is also a dufus. The trial is just a character assassination and he muddles through that and gets convicted and condemned to death mostly because he did not cry at his mothers funeral.<br /><br />During all this, he does some arm chair philosophizing and wonders how he got into this mess.<br /><br />Well Camus did a good job of developing Meursault's personality...if you could call it that. The rest of the characters are hardly touched on at all.<br /><br />If you look at the novel as a condemnation of the French judicial system, then it has some merit. If you look at it as the sad story of a man with a character disorder, then it has some merit. I know it is blasphemy, but if you really look at it as great literature, I believe it falls far short of the hype.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|I've used similar apps, but this one is straight forward and works great. I would recommend it to anyone who uses streaming as a method to watch videos on their TV.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was excellent, well written, and so insightful.  I recently lost my amazingly smart lab of 14 years and maybe that's why it touched me the way it did, but it is a serious story is about human experience as witnessed by Enzo the dog.  Great story and I think adults of all ages and preferences will enjoy it!
B009X01FJS|4.0|Love that it came in pink! Also the rotating screen is really great, I love to use it in the kitchen. My only problem is that sometimes the magnet that turns the kindle on and off doesn't work. It doesn't work most often when I plug it in to charge, I have to manually turn the device off and then manually turn it back on again when it's done charging.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its pretty cool it gets rid of boredom that's for sure. I like it. I think other people will like this too.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved the detailed history in this wonderful story of a world at war and on the edge of change. Life has a way of changing us and this book shows how much we will change for love of GOD, family and country.

B005LAIGPU|5.0|Scripted by Max Landis and directed by Josh Trank, Chronicle offers a superhero origin story without the added weight of familiarity. The characters share powers and struggles that have graced the four-color pages of comics for decades but have the freedom of eschewing the necessity of selling toys in favor of a solid story unlike some recent flicks (I'm looking at you, Avengers). What we are given is a story of three teens who find something in the woods that gives them abilities beyond belief. These events are &#34;chronicled&#34; (See what I did there? Clever, huh? ;P) via one of the young men and his trusty camera. The plot is essentially the same as every other superhero flick but we get to spend a little more time getting to know these guys as people and not costumed heroes. The film is not without its flaws, which are negligible in my opinion, but at the very least it is an entertaining ride.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is very handy to be able to access words when needed. The only thing I would like to be able to do is go to specific letters instead of having to start at the beginning.

0345803485|5.0|There's more to this book than erotica. It's page turning love story about a naive woman who is seduced by a rich control freak and how she deals with his strange behavior.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an awesome series.  I was hooked from the first season, as the acting is excellent, and so is the location, sceneries, etc.  I highly recommend it.
B001L2CKFE|5.0|i had this cd years ago and lost it. glad to have it back, i love it! great versions of my fav songs.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|This book came out years ago and, at the time, I thought it a bit pricey for something as thin as it was. Now that I've read it, and am a fan of the television show, I found the book kind of ... simplistic. There were no twists, no surprises and the interaction between Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook ... blah on the name ... was nothing to get excited about. I remember the episode where Castle tells Beckett about the steamy love scene on pg. 106. Must have missed it -- guess I need new glasses. I still enjoy the weekly television escapades of Richard Castle but the verdict is totally out on this book. My interest, however, is such that I will read another in the series just to see if the writing and storytelling becomes engaging.
B00199B2Z8|5.0|good&easy reading, helpful to understand why things are the way the are here :-)<br />reading for fun not practice. recommended
B00AOMR2S2|3.0|I loved Pitch Perfect when it came out, and I've watched it more times than I'd care to admit, so Of course I'd buy the soundtrack. I was a little disappointed when it downloaded though. Titanium was not included, and some of the songs were remixed or changed for the album. Final verdict: I like the soundtrack, but the movie is much better.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm never dissappointed with REACHER, I would recomend him to anyone that I think has the stomach for it, and have, including several women readers I know !
B00005NNMK|5.0|price was fair and it arrived rather quickly. I will more than likely be ordering more cds in the future
B0063GORYU|5.0|so entertaining hours of fun can play this anywhere while waiting on the kids or in the doctors office or waiting on dinner to cook
B008KE3960|4.0|Got this one for my husband to play while we sit in the airports on vacation.  He likes the challenge as he is an RC airplane flyer.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Quite a page-turner! The story is much faster and moves more fluidly than Killing Floor. Plenty of mystery too, one conundrum after another. There were a few small issues for me though. One annoyance throughout this book and even the first is that every character is constantly shrugging and saying, \\"right?\\" It's as if Jack Reacher lives in a world where everybody has the same mannerisms. Not really a big deal but it begins to nag a me after a while. Aside from that, I think Reacher's victory over the villain was intense and heart pounding, but the ending after that was somewhat underwhelming. Still a solid 4 out of 5 stars!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I like this game, but I find it hard to see the tiles at times and make out the picture that is on it. Fun none the less.
B005OUHOLY|5.0|Incredibly inspiring book with a great message.  Make sure you do all of the meditations to take full advantage of what this book can offer.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Sometimes I just like to read things that are psychological thrillers, and this one fit the bill.  It was not a soothing story, but it distracted me from the day's events, and so it served it's purpose.  As with Flynn's other work, it was interesting enough to keep me hooked in and ready to get back into the book at every possible time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a really well made app. It's free and I can use my own music as my alarm. If you're reading this and haven't downloaded it yet, why?
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book. It was an easy read and a compelling story. I recommend this book highly. Five stars!
B005DL9O5S|5.0|The whole Brilliant series has probably upended the economics of large classical CD manufacturing and sales.  I think the Mozart set was the first from them (?) and for 160 dollars you had a set that was not far behind the 2,000 dollar Phillips collection.  Despite expectations that I would use them only for reference purposes, I have embarked on a disc by disc playfest (in my frequent, lengthy car rides) and while the listening environment in an automobile can't compare to careful auditioning of recordings, I am in pig heaven.  I can happily drive through upstate New York and never hear Lee Greenwood or Justin Bieber again.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|Don't know why this movie gets criticized - even Daniel Craig criticizes it - lol - I like it - A darker Bond movie, but still with some great action scenes and cool story - slick movie with a cool feel - different, yet still a Bond movie - and I like it a lot - underrated.
0307719774|5.0|I love all the questions<br />Good, thoughtful questions for everyday<br />I really enjoy using this! Glad I bought it!<br />There should be a bookmark attached to the book tho!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|this movie made me weep! bittersweet only begins to describe it. and the picture quality on my judder-reducing sony set, is almost like it is &#34;live.&#34; highly recommended, a keeper!
0061785652|5.0|If you like Dan Brown (The DaVinci Code) or Steve Berry (The Templar Legacy), you're gonna love this thriller by James Rollins.<br /><br />Puzzles, Thomas Jefferson's secret codes, volcanoes, a secret society -- it's got it all in spades. A real page turner. This is my first book by Rollins but I definitely want to read more.<br /><br />Good, pulse pounding action in a historical setting. Was the founding of the United States based on a fundamental lie? This novel is rich in native american culture, Mormonism, science and some great settings from Yellowstone National Park to Iceland.<br /><br />Definitely a must read for serious thriller enthusiasts.
B000059H98|4.0|the story is just the thing for a cold wintry day, to watch under a blanket and forget about one's immediate environs, and get hooked into the story. the sound quality was immersive and the picture quality [on my sony judder-reducing tv set] is sharp and live. a keeper!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What a wonderful way to learn the history of WW1 and WW11.<br />I am of the WW11 generation and throughly enjoyed both books.<br />Mr Follett keeps the interest going, hard to put down his book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've found so many great ideas on this site from decorating to recipes to fashion.  It's fantastic, I'm hooked!<br />Not to mention this is a free App - you can't not afford to download it!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I so enjoyed this DVD.  It puts a modern twist on movie musicals, which is greatly missed.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and sing at the same time.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game.  Its fast and you move up the levels fairly quickly. Thanks Amazon!!!!  Everyone will love this game.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is so much nicer than a normal alarm clock; I can set it to play my own music for the alarm and start off quiet, gradually growing louder. I can have tons of different alarms with labels. VERY useful!
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Disc 1 is most known songs, especially those who plays classic John Barry Orchestra, which last and make a &#34;classic&#34; style, the remaining songs are hits from various artists in fashion, from the 70s to the present.<br />Disc 2 contains incidental music themes that accompany the most famous scenes in each film, with some songs reference the theme for the film.
B000002W9Q|5.0|Great CD!  Would recommend it.  If you love sound tracks then you will love this.  All original songs.  Good to have.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My grand daughter loves this app, and even more so now that she has it on her mother's Kindle Fire. This may also have something to do with her mother being a Beautician!
0783240236|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock sure knows how to make them.  This is one of my favorites.  Worth getting and watching.  The sound is terrific.
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|As a former Planetarium Director, long time Earth and Space Science educator, Science writer, and astronomer this is one of the best astronomy programs so far available for the Kindle Fire HD, 7&#34;. I have used Distant Suns for many years on the PC so I was pleased to see something as this powerful was available for the Kindle.<br />Well worth the price if you are jonesin' for an Astronomy fix, or want a quick look at was is up.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I have newly discovered Kate Morton and I love her stories.  I haven't been kept spellbound by a book in a long time and she has rekindled that &#34;can't put it down&#34; feeling,.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Like the subject line says this is an extremely versatile and useful program. I like it mostly because it allows me more or less the same access to what is on the Kindle, as does a program like Explorer on a Windows PC.<br />Allows for access to all installed files, and especially for using the built-in camera.
0743244249|2.0|Don DeLillo's 2003 novel COSMOPOLIS goes to such extremes that I really think that I was too stupid to understand it. A slight novel, at a shade over 200 pages, DeLillo tells the story of a 28-year-old financial wizard as he rides in his specialized limousine through the winding streets of April 2000 New York City. Since reading his epic UNDERWORLD in the late 1990s, I have only ventured into DeLillo's world three times, never coming away enthralled or particularly entertained. In preparation for the film version with Robert Pattinson I pulled the book off the too-read shelf and, well, like I implied, just didn't get it. The book opens with the day and month, but the book is written, and seems to make implications to, a parallel New York City, with the same landmarks but a different vibe. Eric Packer, the protagonist, holds meetings, a proctology exam and sexual relations in the limousine, with stops for sex, meals with his wife and at one point being an extra in some kind of strange docu-drama involving naked people. There is gunplay, medical intrigue and political confusion all swimming in the pages as the book winds its way on what appears to be improperly mapped streets. My reaction to the book, as most books I read, is from the gut, and I am sure DeLillo is writing the book on multiple levels, I just wish at least one of the levels was engaging.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserables is a great novel to read. and it was offered free of charge thru amazon. Thank you very much
0805028846|3.0|Some great ideas presented in the book;however,the instructions are not executed well to teach reader how to recreate the cards. There seems to be an over abundance of information on how to recreate pop-up heart cards which was very disappointing.<br />You are better off borrowing from the library.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Season 5 was not yet available on netflix and had to watch it.  We streamed it from our computer onto our tv with the HDMI cord.  Loved it!
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Good read, lots of good foundation material for the beginning lifter. Refresher for the experienced lifter. Motivating way of reading. Similar program to a 5x5 routine.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me entertained, but sure is wacky!  Makes you realize your marriage is pretty great.  Don't expect a great piece of literature though.
0618918248|5.0|The best non-fiction book that I&#34;ve read for a long time.  Dawkins puts his  argument so simply, logically and convincingly<br />that none of the rebuttals I have come across can hope to compete.  And I don't remember when I last laughed out loud so much at what is a very serious book.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought this for my daughter's Kindle Fire HD and it didn't fit. I have the regular Kindle Fire and it fits.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Wait, did I really buy this?  No, I couldn't have.  My dad told me I am not allowed to read it because it is banned by the Catholic Church...oh, well..
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was very hard to put down. It has a love story and suspense. Great combination. I can't wait to see the movie!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Great CD...Always a fan of Dylan................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... ..... ..... . . . . .. . . .
B006IYFCIM|5.0|I found this book very interesting. I loved all the different types of studies and I found myself thinking of instances when I too cheat ....but just a little haha
B009CGYO0K|3.0|The book is really a comic book, very short to have such a high price.  It is mostly illustrations.  Yes, it is funny in places, but  far-fetched.  You can finish it in 15 minutes so the amusement is very short-lived indeed,
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great book!  Very easy to read and if you have ever wondered why you just cannot seem to 'get through' to someone, a friend, or in your relationship, etc...this is a great book to read.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Science fiction lends itself very well to short stories. The first Wool was great but it begins to fall of shortly afterwards. One gets the feeling that the author forced the other parts to capitalize on the popularity of the first one. This was very much inspired by City of Ember. It's a similar setting where the air outside has become toxic and humanity now lives in a silo underground. The characters are intriguing and the world Howley describes is vivid and facinating. The science is sketchy at best which is disappointing because a little effort could have reconciled most of it. The final reveal is weak and the story trudges along too long and too slow. If you are short on time read the first Wool, it's free and its awesome.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Another really good Diana Krall CD.  This CD is worth the price for it's enjoyment value.  Buy this CD and you will see.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another excellent story in the Jack Ryan series.  These are among my favorites and I cannot recommend them enough.  Tom Clancy is the best!
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Diana Krall is such a great artist, and it can be said that everything she records is going to be enjoyed; this album is no exception.  A really nice jazzy Christmas album.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|really not  very easy to navigate on my pad and no real explanation of how to achieve your goal.  I kept looking for a hint or guidelines page but nothing.  When you get stuck you're stuck for life unless you can figure it out.  Just not as happy with this particular game
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Ok, so I have heard that Fii0 makes great products, and I am sold.... I use this to hook up my Apple TV to my older stereo system in my bedroom... It is always on, I never turn it off and have had zero issues with it whatsoever... Great sound quality, would buy again, but I don't think I will have to...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book and it's companion books were so good.  I know they're supposed to be for young people but even us old folks could get behind Kat.  I suspect they are also a good lesson in morality but more importantly they're just a blast to read. Thanks Suzanne Collins. I enjoyed each one more than the other and was sad when I closed the last book.
B0060ANZ2Y|5.0|Its the original Album on CD. Man its Great! I was pleasantly surprised when i heard it. Its exactly the way I heard EWF in the early 70's. Listen, you'll  see!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book and it's companion books were so good.  I know they're supposed to be for young people but even us old folks could get behind Kat.

I enjoyed each one more than the other and was sad when I closed the last book.
B008S4FZHI|4.0|I am a fan of Kay Scarpetta so this book was a natural progression of her adventures.  I enjoyed it from start to finish.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book and it's companion books were so good.  I know they're supposed to be for young people but even us old folks could get behind Kat.

B0069JBKHI|5.0|We got this for our baby girl who is due in March, and I've been trying it out in my 5 up son's room... It works amazingly! Love the video quality, all the options, being able to talk, setting what temp alerts and humidity alerts I want, and being able to check in whole I'm at work! This is well worth every penny! I'm very happy with my decision to go with Withings!!
B0063IH60K|1.0|This is basic, really basic,solitaire.  I think anyone who plays on line or has played multiple types of solitaire will be bored to tears.  I know I was.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|A beautiful book Louisa May Alcott has a beautiful book written and I praise it for its beauty an wonderfulness
B00710Z87M|5.0|Wonderful, well written, great information. I would recommend this book to anyone searching for guidance, strength and a better understanding of money and how to use it to improve the quality of your life and others!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was riveted from start to finish. I loved the first book, but I loved this one even more! Amazing characters and story!!!
0375851569|2.0|I ordered them in \\"Like New\\" condition, and I expected to get the case with it. However, it seems I was wrong. They came to me with a rubberband wrapped around them. No case. I was very disappointed by this. The books themselves were not in the \\"Like New\\" condition which I wanted. They were bent and the spines had some wear damage. This is supposed to be a set that will sit on my 1 year old nephews bookshelf in his new nursery. I suppose the only upside is that the pages can still be read. I had hoped for a set in good condition with a nice case to store the books. Apparently not.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is a must-see for any NPH, Nathan Fillion, Felicia Day or Joss Whedon fan.  Happily, after viewing this, you'll probably be all of the above!  (I'd also suggest you see it if you're a fan of Glee, The Rocky Horror Picture Show or any movie considered a cult classic.)<br /><br />Shot on a super low budget while the WGA strike was ongoing, Joss Whedon has collected some of his family, friends and colleagues to write, score and star in a campy little story that took the internet by storm.  It's not only a lesson is gorilla film making...it also just stands on it's own as a great piece of work.<br /><br />You can relate to the story, you find yourself singing the songs and you will anxiously await part two.  And you'll laugh so hard in spots that you'll have to stop the DVD so you won't miss anything.  And be sure to watch \\"Commentary: The Musical\\" and search for all the easter eggs hidden on the disc.<br /><br />Buy the DVD and the music and then join an online fandom to bug Whedon about finally getting around to making the next part!
B0015F1VY8|5.0|I loved this movie very much. I would definately recommend it to any one who is interested in this time period.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I probably can't say anything new that hasn't already been said about this amazing and sadly, short lived, television series.  It was the best written show on television, had a fantastic score and characters that you wanted to run away and live with. It's \\"Star Wars\\" for the \\"Next Generation\\" (see what I did there?)<br /><br />If you got that reference and have not yet seen this series, just save yourself some trouble and buy the blue ray edition -- we've already worn our regular DVD copies out.  Absolutely everyone who enjoys science fiction, is a Nathan Fillion fan, enjoys well written shows or is a Whedon fan (old or new) should at least check this out.<br /><br />And if you buy this and by some fluke don't like it, you can always sell it somwhere because, unlike most tv shows, this one just keeps gaining in popularity.  It's been ten years and it recently had a special made about it on the Science Channel!  It was so good that the cancelled series spawned a major motion picture!  It's got websites, fan movies, critical essay books, comic books, podcasts and a legion of \\"flans.\\"<br /><br />...have you bought it yet?
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I do not think this season is as good as the the first season. I hope there will be a third season with more substance to it.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I saw this for the first time as a teenage girl home on a sick day and was not looking forward to it.  Home sick and Mom brings me a cowboy movie?  WTF?  As I recall, the only reason I watched it was because I had a long day on the sofa in front of me and this was actually a mini-series and so promised to take up most of my day.  Well, thank goodness it was long!  It was fantastic and I got to the end of this and cried (when the reporter tells Capt. Call that people say he's a man of vision.)  And I still cry every time I see it (which is probably about once every year or two since I bought the DVD.)<br /><br />These characters are so beautifully written in the book and translated to the screen that they become real people to the viewer.  You care about them, worry about them, shake your head when they do the wrong thing and laugh right along with them.  And you will laugh more than you'd think you will (even the book is funny in spots.)  Sure, there's adventure but there's also love, family, hijinks and raw humanity.<br /><br />There are many adaptations of this series (and some of them have some fine performances) but this is the quintessential adaption.  Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall are magnificent and many of the supporting players are incredible too.  A truly amazing story and cast and it holds up even after all these years.<br /><br />In fact, we still yell \\"Joo-lie\\" every time we see Chris Cooper!  Doesn't matter how many parts he plays or how famous he gets, he'll always be July to us.  Why are you still reading this?  Go watch it right now!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|this is good but her musci is a bit of a downer, she is always crying about a love gone bad
B000YH6YG8|5.0|I watched this movie years ago.  I saw it in Amazon and I decided to re-watch it.  Film was just as good as it was the first time.  Definitely recommend.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book, you think you see it coming but are not sure. Not surprised it has been on best seller list for so long. I recommended this book to a friend already.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Love this movie!!  Glad to find it here as I couldn't on Netflix orHulu.  Got to show it to my kids and they loved it too.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I like this game.  Its great that you can choose your levels to challenge yourself.  I can't put it down once I start playing!
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Good for the whole family, movie night.  This is the funniest of the Wimpy Kid series.  We Enjoyed all around.
B0089BSOPA|5.0|i bought the collectors edition of Halloween 2  as it deserves to have the special edition treatment! well worthy sequel to the classic -  for me the story ends here... what ive always wanted to see was a behind the scenes documentary and location areas reviewed...plus a decent commentary from stars and or director...im pleased as punch that this edition has all of them  plus a bonus cut of the movie with more scenes and less gore...there is only one down point which is i wish (like the original) the picture and sound would have been upgraded, but still this film is a must for Halloween fans 10/10
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Our 8 year old LOVES superheroes (well...so does the thirty something dad) and this movie is a favorite here. It's a bit violent for some parent's taste, but we previewed it & enjoy it as a family often!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Im going to keep this review short as there are so many excellent reviews on this version already.  This is one of my all time fav movies and holds fond memories when i first watched this on vhs back in the early 80's. This movie was so powerful i wanted to visit the actual mall and be those guys! so after years of watching cut versions or edited tv versions...here is the best of the best The ultimate version - 4 discs of everything you want or could want to see! and for the value it is a must for any fan (if they have not got it already)  10/10 George Romero is the master.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|Great book.  Quite different from what I expected.  Expected a standard police novel but got a much broader and deeper story that I found far more compelling.  The author does a great job with atmosphere and character development.  I'm ready to read the next book in the series but find its not available yet.  Something to look forward to.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Finally they released this for the android!  played it on a friends itouch &amp; loved it :) I'm a horse person &amp; this game is amazing with the graphics :)
B008FIATBE|3.0|I am a HUGE Chris Brown fan, and have been ever since his official debut. However, I am not in love with this album like I want to be. I am still listening to it and trying to connect to the majority of the songs. We'll see if that happens. I sincerely hope that this album isn't indicative of where Chris's creative genius is headed because I am not sure that I can stick along for the ride. I do, however, still really like all of the songs released as singles, which is what prompted me to buy the album.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ.THE BOOK KEEPS YOU GLUED TO THE PAGES. I STAYED UP LATE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPEND TO THE BAUDELAIRE ORPHANS.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I was an instant fan of Bruno Mars as soon as I heard him on a B.O.B. track and discovered he was behind so many other hits. This album is yet another home run for me. Keep up the good work!
0517591812|3.0|LONDON is a good story.  NEW YORK  by the same author which was better I think, is what prompted my purchase. It's a book, what more needs to be said.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This was the best one yet. Rick brilliantly crafted a book depicting the labyrinth. He is still my favorite author.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Just received this knife and haven't used it in the field.<br /><br />Out of the box this knife is impressive.  It is definately a work horse.  I wouldn't hesitate to use this blade for chopping and splitting wood; it is thick.  If weight is a concern then think again.  I was surprised a bit at the bulk of the knife.  I have carried an old kabar marine knife into the field with me many times but for day to day tasks I'll reach for something smaller.  I am not questioning the ability of the BK2, I am just able to meet my current needs for creating kindling and fire with much less knife; not worth the extra bulk and weight for me.<br /><br />The sheath is solid but working the knife in and out will take some getting use to.  You will get to know this tool only by using it.  Excellent knife but just more than I need.  I was at a show over the weekend and saw the Becker drop point short.  Put it in my hand.  Very nice.  I believe it is the knife I am looking for.  I am getting one.<br /><br />I appreciate the knife is made here in country.  We need the jobs.<br /><br />Great knives Kabar!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I CHOSE THIS BOOK BY ACCIDENT.  IT TURNED OUT TO BE WORTH THE TIME.  IT HAD A GOOD PLOT, KEPT MOVING , INTERESTING CHARACTERS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|The movie is action movie with some decent special affects and kind of strug together plot. Overall it was entertaining but definitely not one of my favorites. I liked the big dog the best. Don't waste a Friday night watching it.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Great story told in an ingenious way, diary (journal) entries, letters, captains log, newspaper cuttings and business transactions. Pity I already knew the plot, must have been terrifying when it first came out though. Also provides a snap shot of class and gender relations in Victorian Britain, which for all their horrors can't compete with the Count.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|I enjoyed it but for some reason it seemed to lack to Spy/Cloak and Dagger type of action in these movie I expect. It was a typcial Tom Cruise star role fighting a seemingly impossible situation and time table to save the world. Naturally in all Tom's movies he plays these roles but this movie was just lacking something the previous IMs had at least for me.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The answer is NO !!!!  I saw this movie 2 times and I will see it again and can't wait till the dvd comes out.  I was totally surprised by Russell Crowe's singing.  I think he did a fantastic job. All the characters did a fantastic job.  On here you can only rate it 5 stars, but I give it a 6+
B003RV43X4|4.0|It was entertaining for me as I enjoy these type of movies. I liked the actions scenes and special affects. Still prefer the old version..don't ask me why but I do.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|This book has sat on my shelf for close to four years. I wanted to read it but somehow never did. I had heard so many wonderful things that when I finally opened it I was prepared to love it. I did not love this book, much to my surprise, since I am a big historical fiction reader, but this book missed the mark.<br /><br />I have to say that I knew very little about the Vel' d'Hiv and was quite horrified by the depiction of those events. The telling of the story through the eyes of ten-year-old Sarah was gripping. The parallel story of Julia Jarmond, the journalist reporting on the 60th commemoration of the infamous round up of thousands of French Jewish citizens and their eventual death at Auschwitz, is far less interesting.<br /><br />The book starts out at a very fast pace, alternating between 1942 and Sarah's story and 2002 and Julia's story. Unfortunately once Sarah disappears from the narrative the book loses steam and limps to a finish that I found very odd.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems is the character of Julia. She is such a spineless wimp; her husband is an arrogant ass and her daughter a bit too precocious 11 year old. The coincidences that put Julia's family smack into the middle of Sarah's story are a bit of a stretch and her unhealthy obsession with Sarah's story was unbelievable. The final conclusion was something I found just too `icky' for words; it just seemed wrong and a bit too happy ending considering the rest of the book.<br /><br />I realize I am in the minority on this, but I honestly could not wait to be finished with this book. I believe I have A Secret Kept; I am not in much of a hurry to pick it up.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Well not a lot to say but it is basically a lot of great action heroes from past years coming together for predictable action plot. Now if you go into understanding that, it is actually a good entertaining movie. I enjoyed seeing some of my childhood action heroes unite against some bad guys. Plenty of explosions and corny catch phrases but well worth it. Would watch again...maybe but definitely enjoyed watching for the first time.
B003BWERF8|4.0|Like a lot of the other reviewers have already mentioned, this device is compact and if your current Apple music player doesn't have bluetooth, this works perfectly.  Range indoors is about 20 feet and outdoors it's good enough if you have it in your pocket while running, and even better if you have it on your arm.<br /><br />The downside as a lot of folks have mentioned is the battery life.  I got about 7 hours of continuous play through my iPod Classic.  The mileage on my iPod Nano 3G varies, but it drains pretty quick, though it's more than enough if you run/workout for an hour or so and are not too far from your charger.  That's why I took off one star.<br /><br />Highly recommend though if your Apple music player doesn't have bluetooth when you consider the cost of the newer [[ASIN:B0097BEDPG Apple iPod nano 16GB Slate (7th Generation) NEWEST MODEL]].
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Ahh a journey across a post apocalyptic U.S. where hope has abandoned all remaining humanity with Denzel as a vessel of hope. Denzel can normally carry the weight of ay movie he is in an this is no exception. You would have to be blind not to enjoy this movie...ha!
B005LZW8FO|5.0|Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling) is a brilliant student with a bright future, until vehicular manslaughter lands her behind bars. John Burroughs (William Mapother) is a promising composer whose life is irrevocably damaged when a hapless teen driver kills his family and puts him in a coma. Flash forward to four years after the accident as John and Rhoda are restarting their lives. Little do they realize, Earth II is about to bring them together in a way that neither could predict or ever comprehend.<br /><br />Another Earth revolves around Rhoda and John and the relationship they develop in the aftermath of the accident. Both, each in their own way, have become estranged from the world around them, mere shells of their former selves. She being wracked with guilt, decides one day to visit John and express her deepest regrets and sorrow. What she finds is a total mess of a man, and in a moment of weakness, she buckles. Instead telling him who she is and why she's there she can only offer, in the smallest of gestures, to help him clean up his life. Eventually, Rhoda becomes his salvation and John, hers. The two broken souls become involved in a torrid love affair until an unexpected opportunity leaves their relationship at a crossroads. Rhoda is now faced with the decision to tell John who she really is and what she's done. And if she does, can he still love her?<br /><br />Don't let the name fool you, because Another Earth isn't really about another Earth. Another Earth is about redemption, forgiveness and the impact of second chances. It's a powerful film that captures both the imagination and the heart. This little indie film was born of grandiose vision while simultaneously facilitating deeper introspection which renders this particular viewer at a loss for words. In short, I felt ALL THE FEELS. And let me be honest, it isn't an easy movie to watch. It'll punch you in the gut, leave you conflicted and wondering \\"what if?\\". The entire time I was stuck in a love/hate battle with Rhoda and her situation, but at the same time, I couldn't help but care about the poor girl. She's got a good heart despite some of the questionable choices she makes. By the end, you learn to not judge as you ask yourself \\"what would you do if you were in her shoes.\\" Spoiler Alert: It's not an easy question to answer.<br /><br />A little more drama than sci-fi, Cahill has done the impossible in making us realize you don't need millions of dollars accompanied by a frenzy of CGI SFX to leave a lasting impact. Sure, the science is slightly questionable but it doesn't really matter because the whole Earth II thing takes a total backseat to the relationship between our main characters. Watching it blossom and bloom and whither is a tragically beautiful thing. By the end of the movie, left open to interpretation, the one thing we learn is that forgiveness and truth lay in the inner spaces of our hearts rather than an entire universe away.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Another Earth is remarkable indie film full of heart and soul. It's one of those movies that makes you think and wonder \\"will she, won't she,\\" the entire time. You're given more questions than answers but it's satisfying to be given the power to draw your own conclusions. Just make sure you have a box of tissues handy because it's emotionally jarring in a very profound sort of waytle with Rhoda and her situation, but at the same time, I couldn't help but care about the poor girl.

B00A0SKFLG|3.0|OK it was not bad. It had good action scenes which seem to run non-stop but while it is remake or twist on the old Total Recall it misses a lot of the creative the original had. It is not terrible but Hollywood through some new paint on a old car and sold it again. If they were going to remake it they should at least went to the moon like they did in the first one. Overall entertaining but lacking...action scenes are great though.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book.  I love dogs and often wondered what mine were thinking.  Enzo is and amazing character and he was a wonderful story teller.  It was enjoyable and thought provoking.  I will highly recommend this book to all.
B00333NCTM|5.0|I bought this book by mistake, I hit the &#34;Buy this book&#34; on my kindle and felt awful. But it turned out to be the best mistake Ive ever had. This is the funniest book Ive read. In my entire life. I woke up my family so many times while reading this, just with pure hysterical laughter. Even if you dont like his music, this is magical.
0345528581|4.0|I thought this would be a great way to exercise any place any time.  The first chapters are really good; he reiterates that muscle mass burns calories all the time and gives as much science as I can tolerate on getting the best results with the least and most efficient actions.  I'm all for that!  And I learned a way to build toward a regular push up when I have all my life only been able to do a &#34;girl's&#34; push up from on my knees.  So all in all I think this is a very good book; the exercises are illustrated well, you can start as easy as you want and build on existing exercises to an advanced level.  You are not overwhelmed with the number of exercises.  His defined regimens tell you exactly how to start and progress.<br /><br />The only issue I have is that while you may not need equipment per se, I think equipment would help.  Some of his set ups used props that I didn't have in my house:  chair is too low, table is too high--I don't have large speakers that are just right.  Also, I am only 130 lbs, but pulling with my whole body weight on a door made me scared I'd eventually pull the hinges loose.  He does, however, use body weight and leverage to get results without having to buy a set of weights or clutter your house, and you can get by without buying anything.  Plus, he uses exercises that hit many muscles at once so the workout is shorter.<br /><br />I also like the fact that he is not a celebrity trainer, that he is expert in training for strength, health, and performance.  He has developed the quickest route to fitness because it was his job in the military.  He's credible.
B0007M22TI|5.0|hubby loves it so much, he is driving me crazy with it! as long as he likes it, i guess.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|This is another solid Paramore album. There are several songs I really enjoy on here, particularly Brick by Boring Brick. I'm not much of a fan of Misguided Ghosts. I prefer Riot! to Brand New Eyes, but this is a solid listen.
B00866JL96|5.0|Very good movie.  I loved the story.  Zac Efron is amazing.  Can watch it again and again.  Hope you enjoy it too.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Its great if you just want to have a box set of all the HP movies, nothing special or collectable about it though. It's a nice slim case that doesn't take up more than 2 or 3 dvd box spaces on your shelf, which is nice considering it has 8 movies in it. Great buy!
B009HEMF1M|5.0|Awesome movie with great stars.  Can watch it over and over.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and John Malcovich are amazing.  Their chemistry on screen makes you sit on the edge of your seat.  Funny and full of adventure.
1932100660|5.0|Everyone should read this book - it provides true unvarnished and easy to understand dietary advice that isn't watered down.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|I COULD HAVE WRITTEN A BETTER SCRIPT, MY BOYFRIEND LIKED IT, BUT I FOUND IT BORING AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME, I LOVE HEROES, BUT I DID NOT THINK THEY DID A GOOD JOB WITH THE CHARACTERS THEY HAD AND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE HEROES FROM OTHER MOVIES IN IT, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WAY BETTER.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The storyline doesn't have a lot of content or depth to it.  It is a little farfetched and consists of sex, sex and more sex with the same partner.  Books two and three are considerably better than book 1.  I had to finish the trilogy once I started reading.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I want to I recommend it to my friend Sarah Parrish'..................ps.hi Sarah in joy it......'..............start your ebook now Sarah Parrish

B007G8SET8|5.0|Listening to this CD is like living in the past, but with socialist intrusions we have to hold onto any of the past we can! This CD will set you free! Like America, Rock and Roll will NEVER die!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|A historical background of communist Russia weaved around the most despicable of murders is thought provoking and makes for a great page turner. An exciting read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was a very fast, interesting, read and I couldn't put it down ... but hate the ending as I know the future was up to my own figuring but I like more of a definite from the author.  In the real world, supposedly, good will win.......... really????

B00B2G4ZG6|1.0|No matter how many glowing reviews you may read from desperate television viewers grasping at straws in search of a decent new series to latch onto and watch every week, trust me, if you've already seen the Gerard Butler film, \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" you've already seen this done before. You've already seen it done better. You've already seen it done without so many glaring plot holes and loose ends. And you've already seen it done without having to spend fifteen hours of your life over the course of three plus months just to eventually see the bad guy get what's coming to him. Thanks, Fox, but no thanks. The whole thing reeks way too much of been-there-done-that but if you want to waste fifteen hours of your life, hey, knock yourself out. I just wasted one hour watching the premiere. That was enough for me.
B00000IQW3|5.0|It was a great Classic addition to our collection. LOVE it. My husbad was surprised i found it New. Great Christmas gift
B007RI56NY|5.0|Another great album from Train, packed with both their manic energy and soulful lyrics.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who was a fan of Train's previous outings, like Save Me San Francisco, Drops of Jupiter, or their self-titled debut.  My favorite song on the album is the extremely catchy &#34;50 ways to say goodbye&#34;, but the whole album is excellent.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|You think this is a warm fuzzy quaint story, but it is more of a techie puzzle.  If you are into internet sites and what technology can d,o you may enjoy it.  I did not finish it.  I tried, but found it not interesting to me; however, it was written well.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|My husband loves his Led Zeppelin CD collection.  It would make a great gift to Led Zeppelin lovers for sure.

B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad my sister told me about this game.  It is really addictive! From the screeching monkeys chasing you to the realistic jungle scene, you have to run, jump and slide your way to safety.  There is a very fast pace that will keep you on your toes!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I sometimes suffer from insomnia and the peaceful music and mind work are great at allowing me to be completely at ease. I usually play a few rounds and go straight to bed !
B006ATJXQW|5.0|the book was a quick a read, flowed very nicely. The only thing that I would like now is maybe 1 more book to show how Thomas and Theresa meet in their developments.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love the game really fun like a Sims game this game has tons of stuff to do this game has a lot of real life stuff to it
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I must confess that the fifth series of (the revived) Doctor Who was the first of the show that I watched in its entirety.  I was instantly hooked.  Fans of the show vary wildly in which Doctor they prefer best, and often it is the first (you never forget your first Doctor) - this has been the case for me.<br /><br />If you never have watched the show, the fifth series begins with an all new Doctor, taking over for David Tennant (also excellent), having just regenerated from his 10th incarnation to the 11th (it's a Time Lord thing, and a precedent set by the original show as a way to keep the character alive in the event that the actor left the show or became ill).  Since it's a new actor and show runner (Steven Moffat), it's very easy to start off with season five without ever having seen any of the previous seasons.<br /><br />This particular series is well paced throughout, with story arcs being set in place that reach not only through this series, but well through the sixth and seventh (current) as well.  It begins well and ends with a bang.  As for this exact product - the Complete Series versions of the show are by far the best version.  The 6 disc blu-ray set comes with the most in terms of special features and extras, and the packaging is well designed as well.  A must for any Doctor Who fan.
B006TLFIAQ|5.0|This was a gift for a fellow Jason Statham lover.  I recommend this to anyone who likes action/adventure movies.  Great video.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Redundant scenes and redundant phrases = boring. Not only that, but I found myself hating the characters. Messed up or not, Grey is a jerk and Ana is weak and lacking maturity.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Good one for beginners, liked the simple presentation and clear guidelines.<br />Will recommend the book for aspiring writers and ones who did not find a market for their print books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was the amazing and detailed book I have ever read. When I'm at school, every little second I get, I'm reading this book. I love this book more than the movie. LONG LIVE THE HUNGER GAMES!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I love this book!! It was a good love and suspense book. She is a great author. Good job Suzanne
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Haven't found what i,m going to download the ultraviolet copy too yet??? I`d like to have it on something that I will have for awhile
B000FBFN1U|2.0|I'm new to this series. My brother was telling me how great the tv show is but since I don't watch tv I decided to read it. I'll have to say I did enjoy the first book but my interest has waned with each chapter. Martin's prose is bland and his imagery seems limited for the fantasy genre. There are many fantasy novels that I'd love to see turned into a tv series but I see why this one has been chosen...it's little more than a soap opera dressed in armor. I struggled through this third installment hoping for a light at the end of the tunnel but, seriously, to end the book with lady stark coming back after her throat's been opened is, in Martin's words, a mummer's farce. I'm done with this series. This isn't fantasy writing; it's commercialism at it's finest.
0425252868|5.0|This is such a wonderful true story that couldn't be told for years.  The background of the characters, especially Hans  and the other German pilots was eye-opening for me.  I learned a lot of history about both sides.<br />Truly heartwarming.  Good people can still do the honorable things even in wartime.
B000W9DSVW|1.0|This review is for the blu-ray trilogy of these films.<br /><br />I was under the distinct belief that blu-ray was the best video and sound quality available to date, so why would the blu-ray makers release these films (or any film) with stepped on VHS copy quality?<br /><br />When I saw this package on sale I was excited, three great films for less than the price of one! But I was dupped, the color quality is fair to poor.<br /><br />So beware if you purchase this package deal (???) as the video quality may be as you may expect.
B0044XRIMW|1.0|Absolutely horrendous quality of a purchased movie ever. Froze at least 8 times, then stopping, and we had to re-start it numerous times.  It broke up the entire flow of the story.  I don't know if I'll ever use the service again!
0762439009|5.0|Loved the cup. My wife dropped it. Now I got to buy another kit. Guess that gives me an extra rug for the living room.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This is the first book I've read by Brandon Sanderson, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Despite how quickly you will go through this novella, it gives you a strong sense of each character that is introduced, which can be extremely difficult. It also explores a new type of world where seals can be created to alter objects and the histories they might have had, and therefore changing the appearance.<br /><br />With this concept, the main character is to recreate a soul stamp for the emperor,  but must also convince those around him that this soul is not a fake, but really him. This makes for an extremely difficult task for the main character,  but a challenge she accepts. After all, her work will be considered a work of art, even if no one else will know the emperor is not truly himself.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this book for anyone who needs a quick read or just wants something good to read.
B009ZUKY52|1.0|Zero stars.  This keyboard ships with Avid's Ignite software.  EXCEPT THAT IT DOESN'T, because when you go to download the software, you're told that it's not ready yet.  This is as of January 22, 2013, and goes back at least three months.  If you DO purchase this keyboard, understand that you WILL NOT be able to connect it to your computer and use it in any meaningful way unless you have other software to use (often very, very expensive software).<br /><br />It's clear what happened here: Avid told M-Audio that their software would be ready for download, but Avid blew their date.  No malicious behavior from M-Audio or Avid, although M-Audio has been dreadful in its management of this problem (which affects not this keyboard but many other M-Audio keyboards).  And I'm certain that it Amazon were aware of the issues with this product, they'd likely pull it -- or, should, anyway.<br /><br />If you purchase this product, just be aware that you're doing the equivalent of buying a car from someone who says it's good to go, but in fact it's not good to go: it doesn't have a gas pedal; you have to supply that yourself.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I dont understand what the complaints are. It adds video to the kindle for .99 cents, cant beat that. Who cares if it doesnt have a back facing camera or this didnt come with it, its the cheapest tablet out there on the market. If you want a tablet that has a back facing camera pay more money and get the iipad OR get a camera haha. It WORKS, for  .99 or 1.99 its worth it. Besides the whole point in a tablet isnt the camera. I recommened this app.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story was amazing and I literally couldn't put it down. It definitely leaves the reader thinking about events in their own lives. Jojo Moyes is an incredible writer and after reading this book, I pulled out \\"The Last Letter from Your Lover\\" for a second read. It also is a great read. You will not be disappointed.

B004XJRQUQ|1.0|maybe just not for me (aged 51) but wrestled thru the predictable plot and really not impressed with the writing style of the author
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you like a little sci-fi, especially the more realistic kind that isn't about little green men, this is really well worth a read. An imaginative story, a truly likable guy for the main character.  Plenty of suspense, but not superfluous suspense - it's all believable.  You'll have several smiles at the dialog/narrative, but it isn't that trying-to-be-funny-but-failing stuff you see so much.  My only complaint is that the publisher should have had another editing round to correct typos - it's annoying and often will put me off a book.  But not this one. A very good author, hope he does more (and gets a better publisher).
B000FCKC4C|5.0|a very honest reflection of life and very deep lessons on the real purpose of life - Beautiful and recommended to anyone

B00B26DWN8|1.0|Is it just me who is sick of these flashbacks to hotel rooms where soppy mushy dialogue fills up half an episode. Its like Days of our Lives thrown in and a cheap and easy way of filling up space. These guys are suppose to be hunters killing supernatural beings - the story now has such a formulate to it. Surely the producers and writwrs can be more creative in giving viewrs more entertainment value with unusual beings and creatures appearing. Something new and exciting. The characters are becoming older and the show is looking tired and has very little bang - special effects are old from series 3 and 4. i now watch a bit of a show or just switch it off.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been reading science fiction since I was in my teens. For the past 35 years my reading preference has been with the legends as Asimov and Clarke and others who are strong on plot, character, and realistic science. I overwhelmingly put Mr. Howey's Wool series in that same classification. It has been a long time since I have had difficulties putting a book down. Wool is one of these as well as the prequels First Shift and Second Shift. I quickly and easily found myself transported into this world. I cannot wait for the next edition to be released!<br /><br />You must pick up these books. Thank you Mr. Howey!

B009RI4ZKC|2.0|I liked the movie but the quality of the stream really diminished the experience for me considering this is a nice looking film its a real shame.  I checked the internet connection on my end and was downloading around 10 Mbps at the time so that should have been more than suitable for HD so I am not sure what was wrong here.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Sanderson is one of my favorite authors, and I consider this is a pretty sweet,short read if you want to kill some time between more lengthly books. Although this was a good read, its ending could have been a little more conclusive.
B006LSZECO|5.0|SPOILER ALERT !!!!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!!!!<br /><br />I was blown away by this book. It's raw. It's explosive and it goes to some dark interpersonal places that shed light on the crazy cocktail of doubt, fear and betrayal in a way that I have not read before. I have to say, though, that the character of Amy--even allowing that betrayal can lead many to the brink of psychosis, didn't ring true for me. Especially in the end. I enjoyed going on the ride. Getting ensnared in her bizarre, bitter, &#34;everyone sucks but me&#34; world view was cringe-worthy, but I didn't relish the book 2 part of this story like I did the first book. Maybe it's because I wanted to read about how a more relatable person would go through this tragedy. Maybe I wanted Nick to be the killer. Maybe I had certain expectations that weren't met as a reader. All I know is when I got to the end I felt misery. Pure, unadulterated misery. And, I don't think that people can lead this kind of miserable life for very long. In the end, I believe Nick would leave. I didn't believe his motive to stay. Staying means Amy wins. Staying means living in fear for the rest of his life even as he can't imagine life without her. He has certain rights. He has a trail of who she is. I don't buy that Nick would stay with Amy in the way that he did. But, who knows what goes on in the hearts of men and the women they love? Flynn does an excellent job of bringing us into Amy & Nick's world with wonderful anecdotes and details that switch up and play out over time in unique, thrilling ways. I think this is one read where I can honestly say that when I read &#34;the end&#34; I don't know these characters at all. I can't even imagine their future. I can't imagine what Amy and Nick look like &#34;riding out into the sunset.&#34; There's a deep foreboding.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Book Club Selection and while I enjoy a good mystery, I thought this one was going to be trendy.  Once I got into it - was hard to put down and stayed with me.  To me a good book is one that you are still thinking about a week or so after you have read it.
0062209493|5.0|Had my attention from start to finish. Make time to read it!!<br /><br />This is what makes America what it is!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book is a bit slow at the beginning and just as you start to think it is also predictable it picks up and surprises you. But it is not Grisham's finest...
1611761565|5.0|Had my attention from start to finish. Make time to read it!!<br /><br />Love the inside look at what Seal's are all about and what the life style is like!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I liked the book. A good suspense read. I loved the Lee Child books and this was similar.<br />I would recommend it to  anyone who likes a tough, get it done type of character.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was really good but it was way to short<br />:) I recommend people to read it! ! ! !
B001NHNG64|5.0|The book was another of Lee Child's writing. Perfection and accurate information woven into a novel filled<br />with suspense and problems solved.<br />Would recommend book to anyone liking a &#34;can't put down&#34; book.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|very fun, good brain workout and the graphics were really great. Especially love the plot twists and turns.  I only wish it would have lasted longer.
B007WULJ5G|1.0|Dude,<br /><br />Don't watch this movie it's very f***ed up, trust me on this one people, from Salo, to Cannibal Holocaust, to everything else I<br />I've seen in my life, and trust me I've seen them ALL. I mean every single one of them, each and every scary, frightening, disturbing, you name it, I have it or I've seen it online. After this one, I'm out man, for good and i'm not looking back. The only emotion you get from this film is anger, I can see why some would give this a high rating but to be honest I don't think I can do it, not even a saw or a paranormal, nothing. To the newbies in the game don't watch this movie, but if you do please, be alone don't watch it w/ the homies or the girl, the wife, the son, nobody. Cause they'll think your nuts, and you are... If you are going to watch it be weary and cautious for at least 2 or 3 days you will still be a bit pissy, but I gaurantee you may not watch another that compares. Good luck, and I say to you all in the horror world... goodbye, i'm doing comedies now...<br /><br />Chris<br />S/D

0061122416|4.0|Another of my all time faves. I keep going back to this one, reading it again or browsing through it for a helpful quote or kick. If you didnt read it yet, do so if you're interested in changing yourself for the good of the world.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|enjoyed all 3 books. the reading was easy and will continue to look for more books to buy. this is better than the movie will be.

1572814748|5.0|I ordered this deck mainly because of its size, it's much more convenient than a bigger deck and comes in a nice sturdy box so you can take it anywhere you want. The small size also makes it easier to read spreads (at least for me) because the cards take up less space and are all right there, you can see and connect them easier. The colors are nice too and the quality is all right. I agree with another review where they mentioned that it would be nice not to have \\"US Games\\" on every card but oh well. It's not a deal breaker for me at all, love my pocket size Tarot!:)
0684803356|4.0|This is another book you must read before you die if you have such a list in the making. This is why some books are called important with the potential to change both you and the world you live in

B002C949AE|4.0|An eye opener. Cannot believe what women in these counties go through. The ritual of circumcision is horrific. Amazing what can be done with determination. A great read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great easy read, page turner for sure. Not the ending I expected, made the book so much better!
B0055SWM08|5.0|quell is a great game that's both challenging and relaxing: very impressive graphics, challenging logic puzzles, plus relaxing music all in one!
0393088731|5.0|Welsh has done the seemingly impossible, revisiting the boys from Leith again and making the journey seem fresh. Now that he's done the prequel and sequel to Trainspotting I don't know what's left but if he decides to go back again, I'll come along for the journey.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Not for the weak-of-stomach, but an apparently realistic dramatization of what life is like under evil government. Most revealing to me was how human nature is affected when all of life is based on lies.

B005HP2J66|5.0|This DVD will likely be the only look see into the Upper Paleolithic cave, Chauvet in France. This is a haunting documentary, that takes its time exploring cave art done  30,000 years ago and predating Lascaux and others by 10-15,000 years.  This find will continue to create ripples in the archeology circles. For the casual viewer this DVD connects one to our ancestors in a way that is riveting.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I thought it was a great book. It taught me that looks don't matter<br />I learned that going to school is important because of friends and education!!<br />You should really give it a shot! You won't regret it... I promise!!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams do a great job portraying a Father-Daughter that has twists and turns over the years. My wife and I watched the movie - both of us thought it was entertaining and had a great ending. Well worth renting.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I read Michael Connelly's every book and have enjoyed them all, the Lincoln Lawyer series included. I'm always impressed with Connelly's depth relating to police work and legal system procedures. You can't really fault him for displaying  that investigative depth in The Black Box but it does get detailed, slowing down the story in spots. Its the only reason I rate The Black Box four stars instead of five. Maybe I'd do 4 1/2 stars if I had that option.<br /><br />Bob Rueff

B0041D843M|5.0|I am impressed with the orderly method the author uses to convey his study.  It is too bad that this information is only available for those who seek it out.  It is a must read for anyone who is interested in quality of life, good health, vitality, and longevity.

0465068367|3.0|It is clear from the opening lines of this book that Iris Chang is not a trained historian. My own education in history extends no further than my undergraduate degree, but it does not take a great deal of experience to quickly assess Ms. Chang's lack of objectivity. The prose which she uses when describing the event is muddled and the book itself is rather oddly organized. My biggest objection to the book though is her explanation of the tragedy, which seems to extend no further than a generalized diminishment of Japanese culture as a whole.<br /><br />The first chapter is named 'The Path to Nanking' and as it gives us a broad overview of Japanese history, up to the World War II and the invasion of Shanghai, we get a sense that the author is not simply educating the reader, but building a case against the Japanese as a culture and nation. Iris Chang is angry. This is a logical emotional response to the events which transpired in Nanking, and numerous other atrocities committed by the Japanese, but it is not good history. I have read memoirs of families living through the Cambodian genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge which bear more objectivity.<br /><br />She states in her introduction that she will offer no \\"commentary on the Japanese character or the genetic makeup of a people who could commit such acts.\\" Except she does. Consistently. It is her prose and choice of language throughout the book which leaves the reader disgusted not with just the men who were guilty of these war crimes, but with the entire Japanese people. I do not think this is fair. Also, she does not explain why the atrocities happened. Aside from a 'take no prisoners' attitude espoused by many Japanese generals, she doesn't offer any more explanation as to why the event occurred other than to seemingly place the blame on subservience of the soldiers and the harsh Bushido code of honor and respect for which the Japanese are famous.<br /><br />The most frustrating part of her narrative is the constant focus on body count. She spends a great deal of time trying to prove Nanking was the biggest and most horrendous genocide of all time(going so far as to say how high the bodies would stack if piled on top of one another). She cites the death toll (she estimates 300,000 but that is a debatable figure) then compares it to other mass genocides and atrocities, but limits her cases to World War II, speaking only of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Stalin, and Hitler. What about Chairman Mao, who is estimated to have killed 20 million of his own Chinese? What about the Khmer Rouge? What about Rwanda? These events had all occurred before the 1996 publication of her book (and the Rwanda genocide would have been particularly fresh). But no, instead she repeats again and again how this was the worst of the genocides committed in all of history and a 'forgotten holocaust'.<br /><br />The Rape of Nanking was atrocious and evil and showed the absolute worst in the human psyche and character. But this book does not help us understand why it happened. It is instead simply a damnation of the Japanese, lacking in grace and helping to explain the actions of the soldiers not at all. The Rape of Nanking is a book worth reading if only for a concise description of the actual massacre, but as for her explanations and damnations, I would be cautious. The portion for which I give the book the most credit is the narrative of John Rabe, the unexpected Nazi who helped establish the 'Nanking Safety Zone'. This seems like a contradiction in terms and it was a fascinating portion of the book.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|If you are now or ever were a GNR fan, you really can't go wrong with this album. It really does contain all their greatest songs.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A slow starter but I really got into book and finished by the end of the day. It tore at my heart and I fell in love with the characters. I will read again. This was young love, first love and last love all woven together.
1451695195|5.0|loved the book - kept me reading on - and it did deliver - glad i read it & have passed it on - i recommend it to you
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book is amazing! I was completely lost until I discovered Scott Westerfeld's \\"The Uglies\\" series. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. (especially those who have just finished a great book and need a rebound).
B009G3T01M|4.0|I'm not really into rap music. However, this cd is an exception. Unlike most rap music, it has some good songs with positive messages.
055380684X|2.0|This book comes across as more New Age to me, and I found it easy to put down.  The author takes forever to come to any point, so I dropped it after two chapters.  Look for it at the Goodwill bin.
B007B6VOG0|3.0|There are only three or four songs on this cd that I found to be worthy of a relisten. Even those have to much autotune for my taste. My seventeen year old grandson agreed. Its a good thing I bought it on sale.

B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I'm using a MacBook Pro Retina (no ethernet port), and this USB3 ethernet adapter has been a great solution for me.  Apple makes a ThunderBolt ethernet adapter, but it isn't hot-pluggable in Windows.  In other words, Windows will only detect it at boot.  This USB3 adapter is detected by Windows immediately within any session and functions as you'd expect.  Throughput has been solid and I haven't had any problems with it at all.  Note that I have only tested this in Windows and can't confirm any functionality in OSX.

The best part of all?  It was a free app!!  Thank you Amazon and Rovio

0743201140|5.0|We all know how difficult it is to find a good book. This is a must-read book. Easy to read, easy to follow, explains the difference between a talent and skills/knowledge and why you should find and pursue your talent instead of improving your skills/knowledge in a field that you don't have passion for.
B004HX4RT6|2.0|You know what you're getting here - it's an implementation of Chess. What you might not know is if you try launching the app without an internet connection, it will refuse to launch, so for example this app is useless if you wish to kill time on a plane or in a car without a mobile data plan.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|The price was good, about half the price of what you can buy a movie for in the store. The movie was OK a little corny.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|This app is more of a proof of concept than a useful, reliable tool. What it is capable of is brilliant, but it by no means has the stability to be used to realistically stream media on a regular basis. Definite proof though that technology is moving in a fantastic direction, and we have much to look forward to.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|Wasn't sure I would like the &#34;new&#34; Sherlock but it is a fun movie and I decided I wanted it.  My sis gave me $40 to buy it when new but I wated and got it later for less.  Now I can watch whenever. Good price.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is addicting. As for someone who enjoys the Pacific Coast and hiking, this is the ideal book. Strayed does an amazing job at capturing the essence of being in the wilderness alone with just your mind, and it has opened to my eyes to the kind of preparation for any outdoor adventures.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone I know who reads.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|I liked the &#34;story&#34;, but for 75 pages I think it is overpriced at $2.99. It bothers me that these short stories are marketed with a cover and are not clearly marked as short stories or novellas.  It should be right after the title.....not buried in the description. Aside from that, I found it enjoyable, but lacking in character development and details, mainly due to the length.  I noticed that the second publication in this series is also only 95 pages.  I would be moe interested in a full length novel by this author.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I liked it at first but then I asked 1 question and I didn't answer me and started to say weird things and that scared me so I quickly deleted it from clouds. But I knew how it works and it works great it just was really creepy!

0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones, by George R. R. Martin is a very atypical fantasy novel. Where the model fantasy has an obvious antagonist, and a protagonist who saves the world (or a person or people, etc.), A Game of Thrones is full of deceit, betrayal, and even some dramatic irony.<br /><br />I must strongly disagree with the review \\"Watch The Show\\" by pSyn. I would say for the less sophisticated reader the writing style is distracting, but for the reader who can encompass more ideas in their head at once, the writing style is very detailed and helps the reader feel as if they ARE watching a TV show. In my opinion, watching the movie or TV show based on a book stunts my imagination. For example, the character \\"Hodor\\" in my mind is nine feet tall, well-muscled, and has a hunch to his neck. However, the actor who plays Hodor in the TV show is less than seven feet tall, and in all other ways an average person. After seeing Hodor on TV, that is the only way I can picture him from there on.<br /><br />Martin uses point of view to torture the reader. The story is told from changing viewpoints, and just as the tension peaks, the book switches characters, leaving the reader in a constant state of wondering and concern for what happened to the former character. Martin also uses the point of view from characters uninvolved in the current event, preventing the reader from learning anyone's true intent, when it matters. Dramatic Irony is also created from Martin's use of point of view. (SPOILER ALERT) One protagonist discovers a secret that would greatly disrupt the monarchy, but before they can reveal the truth, they are executed, leaving the reader shouting \\"NOOO!\\" at the book. The fragmentary point of view from which the story is told allows the death of central characters, since there are still seven more.<br /><br />Martin also uses resolution to enhance the story, in a complete lack thereof. Because of the fragmented viewpoints the story is told from, he can end a chapter at peak tension, and switch to another viewpoint. It is really an ingenious design, as it forces the reader to read every chapter, even from Sansa's viewpoint (she sucks), just in case there is a resolution to the previous character's dilemma.<br /><br />The writing style that Martin used in A Game of Thrones is extremely detailed. Here is an example from the book: \\"The young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frost-fallen leaves whispered past them, and Royce's destrier moved restlessly. \\"What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?\\" Ser Waymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak.\\" What could have been written as only \\"What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?\\" Ser Waymar asked,\\" Was enhanced in order to draw the reader into the world of The Seven Kingdoms. Extraneous adjectives and small movements of the character that are irrelevant to the dialogue create so much detail that the story comes alive in the reader's mind's eye.<br /><br />In the end, A Game of Thrones is a brilliantly constructed fantasy novel, leaping over the boundaries of an archetypal fantasy story. I will suggest this book to all of my fantasy-loving friends.ension, and switch to another viewpoint.

1423113497|5.0|Percy Jackson could have been your average 12 year old boy with a few disabilities, to be exact, ADHD and dyslexia. After a clash in with a fury, momentarily killing a Minotaur, finding out that he was in fact a demigod and that he was held for suspicion by Zeus, king of he gods... you could say Percy isn't your average boy anymore.<br /><br />Personally, I find it hard to not rant about how amazing Rick Riordan writes, but here goes nothing. Going into The Lightning Thief, I had zero knowledge of Greek Mythology and now, after reading each book of this series and it's spin off series (The Heroes of Olympus) also at three times each book, I am proud to say that I am a Greek Mythology nerd. (But of course, I do prefer the term, 'wise girl'.) To create an entertaining but quite informative piece of superb writing is awfully hard to come by, so this was an extraordinary experience.<br /><br />The way the characters are created is so unimaginable. Percy is a humorous character that you'll fall in love with instantly. Annabeth, is quite mysterious and an intelligent girl that may be hard to get to know, but she came around in the end. Grover is a satyr, half man half goat and is also quite hilarious in some scenes, like at Aunty Em's garden.<br /><br />Action can get boring when there's too much, The Lightning Thief is not, it is well paced and balanced to produce such a likeable piece of writing that I still love (no surprises).<br /><br />Overall, The Lightning Thief is one of those novels that are just simply too close to perfect. I recommend this book to anyone really, but mythology lovers would be more exact. Rick Riordan is the myth master that will take you on a ride of laughter, shock and heart racing action.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read other  Green 's books ,but this by far is my favorite! I connected with the characters and feel in love with them as I read there stories. It's well written and takes you on an adventure that we'll make you happy, sad, mad, and confused. When I fished the book I found myself just as Hazel did, wondering what has become of Hazel and Isaac. I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone.

0307948110|1.0|very basic and poorly written book...the plot is not well developed, characters are weakly outlined and the conversation are too formulaic and predictable.  a big disappointment!

B003G4W49C|4.0|This book was amazing and I can't wait to read book 2. If the  next book is as good as this one I will never be able to put it down.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel. The story of the main character is fascinating, although the connections to the other characters seems a bit forced. As noted in other reviews, the very simple writing style might not be for everyone, but it really works to convey complex ideas in a very simple way. Easy quick read that is thought-provoking.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast paced plot with a few interesting twists and he sets up Mitch Rapp's next adventure in the last chapter.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Slow, tedious, dull, poorly written, boring, unfocused, disorganized, migraine-inducing...there simply aren't enough adjectives to describe how bad this book is.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn writes flawed individuals and their stories better than anyone else I've read. This novel is a little slow at the start perhaps, but picks up pace and has a truly shocking ending...so worth the wait. Definitely a page turner that keeps the reader engaged. Highly recommend this and Dark Places, both are great.
B00448SE4S|5.0|My second time watching, first time for my wife - she got into it and really liked it!  I can't wait to show it to my kids (when they get a little older...)
B0027MJU00|5.0|If you like dark novels--books about uncomfortable topics and flawed individuals--you'll love this one. Great read, very entertaining, highly suspenseful, highest recommendation.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Bought this along with my new Plasma and the BD player. Stunning video, and needless to say, the most amazing audio as well.
8866131105|5.0|This product is the perfect gift.<br />Bought one for my mother and she can't use another kind anymore.<br />The size is perfect.

B005SS2QXS|4.0|Sadly I couldn't find in white and the case gets bigger as the days pass by but the construction quality is superb!
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|I thought this version was much better than the original.  Stunning visual effects, well-choreographed action sequences, and cool sci-fi concepts made the movie a lot of fun.  The plotline got a little convoluted at a few points, but overall it was fun movie for a weekday night!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is the first app I go to whenever the kindle goes on (at least a million x a day, give or take). It tells me exactly when I need to recharge and then some! The customize color thing is a nice bonus too. Love this app. Don't know what I did b4 I got it. Thanks!

B00AYDC5HY|4.0|it was cute. may even buy at some point. Not the best Tim Burton, but still cute. Adults and children alike will enjoy it; like all of Tim's work. Glad i saw it, but will wait awhile before buying.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a wonderful book that gave me such strength and bestowed greater faith in belief of God and His Heavenly Home.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|i adore this flick. Great for kids and adults. It's up beat, funny, and cute all at the same time.  One your kids will watch again and again, and it NOT drive you nuts doing so! LOL  Wonderful film, glad i bought it.

0425252868|5.0|I had high expectations going into reading this book after hearing an interview on the radio promoting it shortly after it came out. I knew that I just had to get.  Even with the high expectations to start with it turned out even better than I had imagined.
0786956291|3.0|Overall this is a quality product.  The materials are comprehensive: Player's \\"guide\\", DM guide, reversable map, lots of tokens, ability cards and a set of dice.  However I do have some complaints.  Back in the day they used to have Basic D&D, which if I recall, went from levels 1 to 4.  When you were done with that you could get Intermediate set, which took you into a few more higher levels.  The advantage of how it was done back then is the Basic D&D and Intermediate D&D sets stood on their own, they did not need Adv D&D to be viable.  They were not introductions to AD&D, more of D&D on training wheels.<br /><br />Now with this starter set things are different.  First of all the player's \\"guide\\" is not really a guide, it is more of a \\"choose your adventure\\".  This is great for new palyers because you can jump right in and learn the game as you go along.  However this format makes for a horrible \\"guide\\".  If you loose your track, say you chose to be a figher, it is very hard to go backwards to get to the information you may need.  So while this style is great for learning it is practically useless as a reference guide.  I would have prefered more of a reference, as it is easier to find information.<br /><br />Additionally this starter set only has rules that go up to level 2.  Your characters will get to level 2 after they complete the quests that are included.  They encourage you to make new adventures without giving you enough room for characters to level up while doing those new adventures.  In the DM guide you hve a good section dedicated to creating new quests, a list of monsters to choose from, ideas on how to make new maps, etc...<br /><br />I guess the only way to keep replaying this game and to create new quests is to roll new characters everytime you play.  But because of how they organized the player's guide you are forced to go through the inital adventure.<br /><br />So I think they got a little bit too greedy on this one.  This set should add two things:  1.) reference section of each class in the player's guide to facilitate easier creation once someone knows the rules and 2.) rule that go up to level 4.<br /><br />Now the advantage of this starter set (compared to the old D&D basic) is you are learning the same rules as, what we used to call, \\"Advance D&D\\".  So once you go through this set you can go right into the full 4th edition game, it's the same game.<br /><br />Overall great product.  I bought it for me to teach my son how to play RPG games.  He is only 9 and we are not ready to go full fledge 4th edition.  So I really wish this set stood on it's own as a game and not be JUST a feeder to to full game.
B000B5XOXY|4.0|\\"Batman Forever\\" works best if viewed as a modern big-money, big-sets film version of an episode of the Adam West television series, and not as a direct continuation of the superior Tim Burton-Michael Keaton collaborations to open this film series.  New director Joel Schumacher brings a different artistic value to Gotham City, trading more on the pulp qualities of the comic book medium than on the artistically framed darkness that Mr. Burton highlights.  Schumacher's vision of Gotham City is loud, bright, and fantastical.<br /><br />This 1995 indirect sequel to \\"Batman Returns\\" employs Val Kilmer in a bit of an unfortunate one-off in the dual role of Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Mr. Kilmer makes for an intriguing Caped Crusader, but his Bruce Wayne is rather shallow.  Overall though, I would have liked to have seen him in more than one \\"Batman\\" movie.  A sensual Nicole Kidman is wonderful as Dr. Chase Meridian, a psychologist intrigued with the mysterious qualities of Batman.  Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones portray the villains Two-Face and Edward Nygma/The Riddler.  Mr. Jones is solid as Two-Face, alternating wildly between quiet menace and bombastic theatrics.  Jim Carrey is simply perfect as Edward Nygma/The Riddler, the disquieting 'Riddle me this, riddle me that...' line delivery in The Riddler's hideout a reminder that this movie is not all camp and corn.<br /><br />This movie is sorely underappreciated, and yet far from a classic.  Also featuring Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin and Michael Gough returning as Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred, it is an entertaining popcorn movie that's worth revisiting from time to time.
030759565X|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my girlfriend. She is a big fan of the blog. She has been making me some delicious food and is ecstatic with the gift.  I am no cook. I was impressed with the fact that she offers up mostly new recipes and not just rehashing what she has served up on her blog.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love the puzzles and extras feature. Love how collecting things really helps. I'm so addicted! Trying to out level the rest of my family adds even more fun.
B0071BGOJC|1.0|I have enjoyed reading this excellent book. It brought back bad memories having lived during these horrible times. It almost feels like it happened yesterday. It just proved that war only bring misery to the people of the nations involved. Yet no one seems to have learnt a lesson from the past as nations are still in the grip of war such as recently Lybia and now Mali and other countries because of the folly of I am afraid to say Caused by Fundamental Islamists. I enyoyed this well told story as I did read The Thir Reich by Shirer
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This was a wonderful action packed Sci-Fi film that I enjoyed in 2005 in the theater and enjoyed just as much again. The characters are well developed and the story is entertaining and engaging. Sadly, this was the last installment after the TV series ended. I re-watched the entire series Firefly and then this film Serenity.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie and the series.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I already had a VHS copy but wanted the DVD for durability and enhanced quality.  A really great adaptation that has a great musical score, in parts, has both humans and the Muppets who work together seamlessly, and the story is adapted so kids can understand the plot, yet is close enough to the plot to capture adults as well.  IMO this is one of the best and most entertaining Muppet movies, although I admit I am a Christmas Carol addict, and have every version ever put on film.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|I usually don't like remakes, but this was one of the good ones.  Changed the story line a little and definately had better effects than the original.  Well done!
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci writes with a sense of language which presents the flow of the story and the sense of the atmosphere with precision and directness. His characters come across as &#34;real&#34; not just puppets to carry the plot.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|have this on phone and on Kindle Tablet HD and I cannot say that the HD version on a larger screen looks any better than that on my much smaller phone. We really like the game itself,  but honestly, I would not pay for the HD version again if I had to and for that reason, I gave it only 3 stars and say &#34;its okay&#34;.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I find this app very easy to use and I use it instead of my alarm clock or my phone alarm. I really like how the alarm slowly increases in sound as the alarm goes off. You are not jarred awake.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|Nice light it does light up the room nicely. not as bright as a real flash light but does the job
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Having read both The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played With Fire I had to read this one, hoping it would be as riveting as these were. It took me a bit of time to get into, mainly because the author spends the first few chapters introducing new character after new character. He doesn't stick at merely tying up loose ends from Fire either, but introduces a few new plots as well, which doesn't help, and for me this meant the novel meandered in its early stages. But such is the charisma of Salander and Blomqvist, and the power of Larsson's writing, that I read on.<br />The novel moved up a gear with the trial of Salander (`A little irregular,'says the prosecutor) and from then on it was as fast-paced and as engrossing as the rest of the trilogy - with yet more plots to unfold. Despite its faults, this novel ended the series on a bang rather than a whimper, with all storylines convincingly tied up.<br />One of the characters describes Salander's trial thus: `It's about violence against women and the men who enable it.' This line encapsulates the entire series: Larsson uses fiction to at least try and empower life's victims and right some of life's wrongs, and I guess this is what makes the series so addictive.<br />I'm genuinely sorry to have finished the book and the trilogy, and thank you Stieg for giving the world a character as unique and compelling as Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00ESIVR3O Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection Omnibus (Books 1-3)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00MDSM1PY The Magpie Murders - Omnibus Edition]]
B005HSG3VK|4.0|i like this it works for what I want. It is durable and easy to clean and protects the kindle well
B004ADH1RI|2.0|Not exactly High Cinema. A movie for some but not for others. Mostly a kid's film, but some adults like it too
B0002DKCMG|5.0|Very funny movie for the Genre but not something you would show the kids. Even the wife enjoyed the movie which surpirsed me even with all the nudity.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I missed the seasons on PBS but loved it on Amazon when I heard about Amazon's great content..  So worth the time to see such great historical fiction in such a beautiful and real setting.  Can't wait to see Season 3 on my DVR!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Tried to set it up.  Locked up.... tried to contact Amazon... got no where... tried the mfg and the person working with me seemed from another planet.  Asked what was wrong.  I explained that the instruction screen was as far as I could get.... she asked for more details.... When I explained again that I could not  get the clock to appear on main screen.... just the instruction screen she was dumb founded and refused to answer or ask anymore questions.  If the cheapo version gets no response... why would anyone want to try add free version... just pours good money after bad.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is amazing, i got it on my kindle fire and i love it. Though i wish it had as good of seeds as ipod, ipad, or the computer
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I am sure I am one of the many who picked this up because of the tv show.  I was a little worried that I wouldn't be in to it because I knew what would happen and because I am not a comic book reader.  Wrong on both accounts.  The story is just different enough to keep you guessing.  I don't think I'll be picking up many other comic books but I am enjoying this format,  it is a nice break from the wall of words I am used to.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|this USB port worked as expected, but what wasn't expected was the great customer service from the kindle store in that it was given to me free and even shipping was picked up! I was back operational in two days  thank you Kindle folk
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great for the kid in me  and great for my kids and you can't beat the price of free they give you quite a few gems too
B00574Q7PQ|5.0|I do not remember this movie being in the theaters, but am so glad I found it to watch at home.  It is not your predictable mystery.  There is lots of action to hold your interest.  And the ending was not at all what I expected.  Like most movies, this has its mistakes.  For example, how does he still have useable money after having been submerged in water?  Liam Neeson is not one of my favorite actors, but he did a great job in this thriller.  Highly recommend.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|Great film, great actors, eye opening.  It makes you understand that people are more than what you see.  There is life even where there appears to be none.
145210655X|5.0|Got this for the husband for  Christmas. We both love Star Wars, and this book was short, but really cute. I read it in a store, but bought it on Amazon. Fast shipping and the book was in great condition.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. One of the best books I have ever read. It kept your interest from beginning to end.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|A good story and like many war stories, it gives you some insight about the rigorous preparation our fighting people go through.  It is not a &#34;page turner&#34; by any means, but the chapters describing the actual events of the battle and rescue are compelling and riveting. Like many stories about a different country and people, it is interesting to learn about the culture and belief systems.  Good book!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I like the movie because every turnkeep you on your toes.  I would definitely watch again and again and again.
0765325950|5.0|Don't feel like writing a full review.  Could the series have stretched for another 5 books and completed all the arcs RJ started?  Easily.  But Sanderson gave his time and completed the series.  And I liked it (though rushed).  He didn't have to.  He did.  For us.  It was really good so five stars.
0385342039|4.0|Initially I found myself rolling my eyes at the \\"silliness\\" of the lead character, Lara Ligton, and the obnoxiousness of her great-aunt Sadie's ghost. They were a bit over the top. Yet, as I got deeper into the story, I somehow began to adore the characters. I was quite surprised that I enjoyed this novel as much as I did. I would say the silliness and obnoxiousness was similar to Bridget Jones in the Bridget Jones Diaries.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|It works just as it says and it has its own channels that you can watch some shows or movies which is awesome free addition.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I downloaded the movie to my Kindle Fire. It's just an entertaining action/adventure movie that I now can view anywhere/anytime and has become one of my all time favorite movies.
B000I2J6K0|1.0|Bad lightening, bad audio, I can barely watch this without getting really angry for buying this! I would NOT recommended this DVD!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed the book for the most part I was however little disappointed in the ended but it was a good book overall.
B008X8QCTO|2.0|I \\"was\\" going to come on here and rant and rave, but that would do no good.  Here are the problems with this \\"app/game\\":<br /><br />1. You have to go back and forth SOOO much you get confused.<br /><br />2. Some of the things you have to do to get the pieces necessary to keep going are ridicules.  And I am not exaggerating.<br /><br />3. The story makes no sense!<br /><br />4. IF you get stuck, and get stuck you will, you want to look at the Strategy Guide, you \\"HAVE\\" to say you LIKE it on Facebook or you will NOT get to look at the Strategy Guide. EVERY TIME YOU NEED TO SEE THE GUIDE!!!  Oh, and if you are using KINDLE FIRE, you MUST be on WI-FI to do that.  So, here is a hint:  when you click on \\"like\\", just hit back arrow til you see the guide. :)  So, when I was all done with the game, I UNLIKED it!  (Why did I even finish the game?  Because I paid for it and I don't like to not finish things I start.)<br /><br />5. Not even half way through you have to \\"Unlock\\" the game.  Now, I am \\"assuming\\" it did cost $$ to do this.  Right now it is free.  So why have it!!<br /><br />If you like to go back and forth, have no desire to have an understanding of what is going on.  Then have at this game.  Otherwise, There is NO WAY I am recommending this game. Sorry.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great my favorite but the last book in a series is usually my favorite. I'm a girl so I liked the romance but I'm really tough and go riding four wheelers all the time so the action and suspense was great surprising twists and turns it was my favorite one of the book series . The best yet!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun. it helps pass the time. games Are simple and easy to understand so far. i would recommend it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have to admit, I read every word.  I just kept hoping it would get better or, at least lead to a great climax and then an amazing end.  It never did either.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|this movie takes their relationship full circle with the fun plot of time travel, the actor that played Tommy Lee Jones was amazing, he was his younger self!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Recommend this book to anyone in love. Truly a life changing book. Changed my outlook on my relationship and helped us get through the toughest times.
B00471TLZS|5.0|My Grand-Daughter enjoys today's horror/mystery movies and many of the older classics bore her.  But not this one.  She enjoyed it with all the enthusiasm that would be expected.  I love sharing really great classic films with her.  So,show it to a young person or if you are one, then watch and enjoy.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|The app is amazing, you can do SO much stuff with it! I absolutley love it! Cant get any better!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I did love it. I found it very creative. I knew this event as described by Pi didn't make sense, but the end of the book explained it well.
B002YCVWXQ|3.0|I've never been a huge fan of Quentin's work. I truly enjoyed Reservoir Dogs and decided to watch this on a whim. A very good story, but I would have like to see more screen time & character development of the Basterds.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|My husband and I love the CD, however I would recommend the edited version for family listening. My neices and newphews also like the CD.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Explosive ending, kept me guessing the whole time as to the final resolution (which I would not have ever come up with).
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was a quick read and very entertaining.  The story is for younger readers but still a humorous story for adults who remember being around 12 years old.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|If you like Tarantino movies, I think you would enjoy this one.  Of course, the obligatory violence....but also the great dialogue.  There is a memorable scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken.....Awesome!  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are very credible, and perform their roles beautifully.  Give it a go!
B0086700CM|5.0|Me and the kiddos enjoy playing this game.  We like being able to have our own characters and see who beats who!
B006FE83UE|5.0|I hadn't seen this film in years, but it is still a real classic, and the performances really hold up.  Gregory Peck is wonderful, but the kids, Jem and Scout are so natural and sweet it is refreshing.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I really thought it was fun to play with... for the first few minutes.  Then I just didn't see the point.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow deletion from our clouds so I'm stuck with it forever.
0071636080|5.0|Gave this as a gift and both my husband and son loved it!  Guess I should have bought 2 copies!
B008MEM24S|4.0|it is just taking a long, long time to get any new levels.  It is so much fun to play I wish there were more!

0345803485|5.0|what can i say? this book is great its like you can imagine everything while you're reading it! its great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter luvs playing this game and it keeps her busy while I clean. It's good for little kids that luv horses.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I was on my highscore and then it froze and restarted they should fix that issue now I have to do everything again
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVE this book. I read them all, and couldn't put them down! Entertaining and easy read. Highly recommended purchase.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After reading the first book of the series, I was hooked. I knew that the story lines were only going to keep getting better. Catching Fire was a great setup for Mockingjay.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book thoroughly, I wish that we would have heard a little bit more about the characters other than Katniss. I know that the books center around her, but I would have loved to learn more about the amazing supporting cast that was introduced to us in this chapter of her life.<br /><br />This book definitely wraps everything up and if you've read the first two books, you have to read this one to find out which of the beloved characters make it, and which are eaten by reptilian mutts.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|FANTASTIC!  It made me want to write poems and participate in poetry slams...NOT THAT I DID!  But it made me want to! :)
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Didn't want this book to end! The plot, the descriptions, everything were wonderfully written. I'm ready for the next book!
B00ARF92HK|4.0|A solid, goofy action film.  If you're looking to see an array of folks get offed in entertaining ways this won't disappoint.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not put it down.  Everyone has secrets it is just how you choose to live with them and who you choose to share them with.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun for the little ones and adults. good one on one time with your child. great activities from feeding to competing. sound effects are good.
B001CZVVXW|5.0|I was thrilled with this performance of Carmen. The singers are uniformly excellent. The acting and staging are excellent as well. It doesn't get better than this. I enthusiastically recommend this.
B009B8YZKS|1.0|Amazon should put up a better warning system for people ordering from outside of the US.<br />The block books by informing that \\"this book isn't available for your region ...\\" but not apparently for DVD's and Blu Rays.<br /><br />Title gets 1 star (I'm being generous) because I can't bloody well view it.<br /><br />Disgusted with Amazon.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Once again G5 turns out a great HO/Adventure game.  With lots of challenges and puzzela, it will keep your attention.  A nice touch is the built-in walk-through should you get really stuck.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's pretty good it's funny too. I think people should totally ready it I'm sure you will enjoy it I know I did.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I'm supposed to be reviewing the product. I bought the book in e format for my kindle.I downloaded it and began reading immediately,exactly as advertised on the tin.Nothing more to say about that.<br /><br />In my opinion the book was utter drivel, so bad was it that I actually deleted it from my Kindle in case I lost the reader somewhere. The finder might open it and come to the conclusion that i habitually read such trash
B0049P1VHS|5.0|was a christmas gift. he loves it. it came fast and was packaged great. would deal with them again. thanks
B007TNS6JI|3.0|The play is fairly good. The program is a bit buggy and has crashed on me several times. forcing me to restart from the beginning. Not bad for a free program.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I originally purchased this package with the hopes I could work on word documents on my Kindle Fire similar to MS Word, but sadly it was not the case. You would think $15 would give you a workable word processor but it's barely differant than the OfficeSuite that came with my tablet. Apparently I'm expecting too much for $14.99, don't waste your money..
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Its been a wile since I read a jack teacher book and this one just felt like home. I feel like I really know jack and it was great hanging out with him again. Never a dull moment. Always keeps me up late (reading till I can't keep my eyes open). For those of you who don't know reacher. This is a great way to meet. Have fun!
0940985691|5.0|Honestly this is the best book I have ever read on this subject which is written by a layman.  Without a doubt I am unable to compare this with Rishi’s original text. But when it’s about books on this subject which are written in English by laymen, this is my number one. I am grateful for everyone who have contributed to make this book possible.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much. The puzzles are not to difficult which makes it a game that both I and my children can enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a fun game, but needs a bit more to do. It has fun races. And you can get to love your house.
B007N0REX6|1.0|I'm a huge GN'R fan, I grew up with GN'R. My room was filled with their photos and posters. And if there's anything I love more than GN'R it is Alter Bridge. Take the two amazing features of those bands (Slash & Myles) and put it together, what do you have? A Nascar trying to race on tarmac.<br /><br />Let me tell you this. Don't even listen to the samples. Just turn around, save your money and leave.<br /><br />I mean why would you have songs that starts like Mr. Brownstone, Rocket Queen, structures like Double Talking jive. Why did you guys make Myles sing so high that it sounds like a woman yelling at me?<br /><br />Terrible audio quality too.<br /><br />Just stay away from this one.<br /><br />This album yells: Slash is missing his Axl.<br /><br />I wish I can return it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I'm in love..Lol I play the game everyday...no complaints! You just have to play it enough to fall in love and make sure you adds the neighbors u can.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got a great price on pre-order, price price guarantee gave me $2 back. Now, let's talk about the discs, the movies are awesome, and you know it. The box is great and I know it 'cause I have it, I smelled it, I could even feel the ink smell: uhmmmm...! The book art is magnificent, short but beautiful, it's my deal: &#34;quality above quantity.&#34; The best deal for this franchise so far. Oh, and good packaging too.

B007REV4T8|4.0|James Bond devotees will get their fix in this excitingly sculpted story that takes 007 to a new level. Following the shenanigans of James Bond movies has as part of its reward the opportunity to see some of Britain's finest actors with a smattering of other countries polished veterans as well. The usual Bond formula - absurdly impossible chases and fights, scenic splendor form around the globe, beautiful women in daring roles, and the blur between justice and revenge  - are all present.<br /><br />When James Bond (Daniel Craig, buff and strong as usual) mismanages his latest assignment in Turkey etc - the unsuccessful chase of Patrice (Ola Rapace) despite the very fine support of agent Eve (Naomie Harris) and the sidetrack of S&eacute;v&eacute;rine (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe), Britain's agents around the world are exposed and MI6 is attacked forcing M (Judi Dench) to relocate the agency. These events cause her authority and position to be challenged by Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the new Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee. With MI6 now compromised from both inside and out, M is left with one ally she can trust: Bond. With the aid of MI6 computer geek Q (Ben Wishaw) 007 takes to the shadows aided only by Eve and follows a bizarre set of clues to the secret island where the slimy Silva (a blond wigged Javier Bardem) is plotting his lethal and hidden motives that have yet to reveal themselves in the very place where Bond began - Skyfall, his Scottish home still managed by his old friend Kincade (Albert Finney). In perhaps the most spectacular (and loud) pyrotechnical exhibition of the Bond 23 films to date (more to come, we discover), the film simmers to an end.<br /><br />Sam Mendes directs this very long but tensely exciting global travelogue of violence and Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan pepper the script with enough humor and clever lines to keep the audience entertained on a more cerebral level. The cast is uniform strong, with Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, and Judi Dench in full control of their lead responsibilities and supported by the fine acting of Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Ben Wishaw in the smaller roles.  If you love James Bond You'll love this. Most critics are saying it is the finest of the Bond series...so where does it go from here?

B008K6DU4Y|1.0|It crashes repeatedly which is very annoying. Very disappointed since this software does wonders on my samsung and htc. Wouldnt recommend it for kindle users.
B008WOULPK|3.0|After watching The September Issue I was througly intrigued by Grace Coddington. Her memoir is an easy read and sheds some light on who she is. I wish she went a lilltle deeper into some of her relationships. Her insider reflections on the photographers, designers, hairstylists and models are worth the read. And I cannot forgot to mention her charming sketches. It would be lovely if she could publish some of her sketches from the years of attending the fashion shows.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Excellent story which is timeless and a relaxing read. This is a book which eventhough may have been read before can be enjoyably reread.
B00AE6SS5O|4.0|This Christmas find it game put me in a merry mood.  Even though it is no longer Christmas, I found this game a lot of fun.  I enjoyed the characters &amp; the story.  However, the game was rarely challenging. It took me a while to finish, so there is plenty to do.  If you would like to be put back in the merry mood then you won't go wrong playing this for a buck.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Little slow in beginning but very good and explained the movie better hence read book before watching the movie especially this one
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i have a feeling i just found<br />my new favorite addiction! someone please tell my laundry and dishes I'll be gone for a while.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love it so far .i download it. its free. go to try it.  just give it a shot. its better than paying full price.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|i found out the hard way that when returning to YOU guys its better to take amazon acct credit instead of refund because i ended up with 96 cents and not very happy!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|loads 'o fun<br />i really enjoyed this spp on my kindle fire.  I just need to get the minimum number of eords.
B0091REZMW|4.0|There is a lot going on at one time and can be confusing fun game and very addictive!<br />I am interested in seeing how far I can go in this game.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|There's no need for another summary of the book, but I think it's important to understand this isn't the usually mystery thriller that so many current bestsellers are.  It's a pre-WWII spy novel, and as long as you know what you're getting and you like this type of novel, you'll enjoy it.  Maybe a bit slow at times, but I enjoy that subtle behind-the-scenes stuff.  Well written with some interesting twists.
B0086700CM|5.0|i am addicted! temple run in a blast! easy five stars! the graphics are great. i really have no complaints. :)
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Good story. Highly recommended. Actors did great, love Amy and Clint. Justin was surprisingly good.  You don't need to live baseball to like this story.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My oldest grandson bought this for a friend of his.  Service was good and item was new. He and I were a little suprised at the cost of this one though.  Somewhat expensive $50 and plastic, how-ever, his friend loved it and was suprised he had bought it for her so they were both happy:))))
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Despite a few laughable metaphors and a couple confusing instances where two characters spoke but the author didn't start a new paragraph, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was g great but something I would usually read. I can't wait to read the next in the trilogy. I would suggest this book to anyone
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is so addicting and just fun to play.  Haven't had any problems with it so far.  My 12 year old daughter won't stop playing it!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time!!!  Movie is long but doesn't feel like. If you're a batman fan, it's a must see!!!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book will stay with you long after you've read it. Very impacting. Absolutely amazing. Everyone should read this book.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I like this book alot. It is really good.you should read it. I heard abut it and now I love it
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Wonderful!  I read it far too late in the night then I'm tired in the morning!  Great book.  I would recommend it!
B00899F0G8|5.0|Has everything, great mystery, great drama,  Riveting  Keeps you guessing<br />ABC Family has come up with some of  the best TV ..Hope they continue w/o falling to the same low level of many tv shows, i.e. foul language and explicit<br />sexual content..
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I FIRST HEARD ERIC CHURCH ON PANDORA. i STARTED REALLY ENJOYING HIS DIRECTNESS AND TRUTH. I LIKE HOW HIS MUSIC SENDS A MESSAGE. I KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO BUY MORE OF HIS WORK SOON. i ENJOY THE CD VERY MUCH. sO HAPPY TO HAVE RUN ACROSS HIS WORK. i HAVE PROMOTED THE CD TO OTHERS ALREADY.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC show!  Lot's of twists and turns... never really know what is coming next.  A must watch!

0525478817|4.0|So, I've found yet another way to annoy my teenage son.<br /><br />I already annoy him by:<br />1. being his mother<br />2. asking questions about girls he's interested in<br />3. talking to his friends when they come over<br /><br />In return, he annoys me by:<br />1. being my son, in other words, a male ME<br />2. being secretive about girls he's interested in<br />3. having his friends over<br /><br />In 2011, he asked for this book as a late Christmas present. He insisted I pre-order from Amazon because he would be guaranteed a signed copy. (Hmm...wonder who he got THAT from...) When the book arrived, he read it in two days. That's a record for him. Most books take him months to complete as they can't compete with the siren's call of Facebook and the XBOX 360. He told me that I had to read this book. I HAD to!<br /><br />I put it in my 'to read' stack. (Well okay, one of my 'to read' stacks.) There it remained. For a year. It drove my son nuts. \\"Have you read that book yet?\\" he would ask. \\"Nope!\\" was my reply.<br /><br />Hehehehehe. Or maybe, bwahaha.<br /><br />Besides my enjoyment of messing with the boy's mind, I was in no hurry to read this book. I'd already read two John Green books. I was pretty sure the plot would involve a winsome young girl who bewitches a shy young man and touches his life in unexpected ways. And, I wasn't wrong. Once again we have a wispy gal who holds a guy under her spell, just by being own delightful self, gosh darn it! Only this time, they're both dying (or living with, if you're a glass half full person) cancer. (I can't help it. I always say it the way my mother did - halfway between a hiss and a whisper.)<br /><br />I tried not to, but I liked Hazel. I liked how she said exactly what was on her mind, no matter the consequences. I like how she kept her sense of humor; so important when you have, well, you know...the thing. And, I liked that she had a great relationship with her parents.<br /><br />It is a truly cruel and unfairuniverse indeed when someone like Hazel receives a death sentence, and Bella of the Twilight Saga gets eternal life.<br /><br />One of these days I'll have to get around to telling my son that I finally read his book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love the suspense and compassion that Nicholas Sparks puts into his books.  Though I didn't like reading about the abuse, it had a happy ending.
B00008GKEG|5.0|My Dad loves the Beatles. This compilation is so jam packed with interesting trivia that most people don't know. This is a great gift for Beatles fans.
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|Some music should never be covered or remade. This is one of those.  This stands as a true classic something that only gets better with time.
B00A2AU314|4.0|This was a typical feel good movie with Clint Eastwood. Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake were good together and the story was good.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Saw the movie then read the book . . . LOVED BOTH!  I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone!
B000YJ54DU|5.0|An engrossing story that draws the reader in and finally satisfies his or her curiosity. Child's has done it again. A winner knocked out of the park.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was one I couldn't put down. I have recommended it to several people. Anita's experience confirmed much of what I believe and answered much of what I did not understand.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Full of good old songs. Upbeat. Only one song I was unfamiliar with. The rest were ones the radio played all the time in my younger years.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really liked this this game.  It had me going till I finished, which is the problem, too short. Loved the graphics and games.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie!! I rented it thinking it was going to be just a funny flick to watch because I was bored.. But it was hilarious and I ended up watching it more than once!
B001OSIV62|3.0|I'm afraid that the shallowness of Philipe was punctuated at the end.  Why he did what he did was strictly for his own personal artistic ego. Someone totally self-absorbed.  He had of course immense talent, but he also had a group of individuals who shared in his triumph. Actually this was a \\"team\\" effort.  He supplied the talent, but he could not have articulated this talent without the help of others.  Where does he go when it's over.  Not to his team and girl friend that he supposedly loved and that supported him.  He dropped them all. I was disappointed in the \\"man\\", not the documentary.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I'm so glad I read this book. It truly is very well written & makes you feel just about every emotion along with each character.
B0072OFM28|4.0|Despite Lucy Lawless' farcical resurrection, the second season is worth a watch.  The Roman Republic speaks loudly to the amorality and entitlement slavery of the current age.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|i never could get this to work.  i 'm not sure why it won't work on my nexus 7, because it works fine on my pc.
B000KGGLCU|2.0|The production quality is high but the dance routines are too much distraction.  I have never been a big Madonna fan but I do enjoy many of her songs.  For me the songs stand alone and do not need the overdone glitz.
0385341008|4.0|i ordered this book because my book club friends had read it previously.  i haven't had a chance to read it yet, but feel like i will enjoy it once i do.
B000Z66RSS|5.0|I loved this movie and the music in the movie, so I had to get the track. It's awesome! I love it and use it to go jogging to.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|sometimes it is slow but it is still very fun. it has so problems starting at times.it can be confuseing
B000002QWD|5.0|I love this CD. It's just another classic. I will always love older music, mostly because it has soul behind it. This CD is a must have for any Christmas lover/music person.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Playing this game is just like being part of the movies. The character interaction is wonderful, and my son enjoys it very much. The responsibility of &quot;hatching&quot; a baby and using your coins wisely is also a plus in my opinion.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|it can be improved but other wise it is very nice... may have a few problems like not previewing the alarm sound early....
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This the last book in the series was my ultimate favorite.  I went from one book right to the next.  Loved the tension between Mac and Jericho.  Although there were times when I wished they would just have sex already!<br /><br />I wished there were more!
0553582461|3.0|To be honest I really enjoy Robin Hobb. I actually own both printed, kindle and audio additions of most of her books. This last book was good and I did enjoy it until the end. The end was rushed and it seemed to want to end the series in the simplest, quickest way possible. At one point you have Fitz taking command as a king and this role was never followed through. He has Molly back and their life is complete no more dealing with the royal family. The way she developed this series that ending seems unlikely. It came off as a \\"fairy tale\\" ending. I also did not like the incompleteness of the ending with the Fool that was truly unsatisfying. I don't regret reading the book but my expectations did not match the writers vision.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this!!!  Look at it daily!!!  Addicting!! Even as a 63 year old I love it!!!  Great ideas!!  I have used many of them.
143350393X|5.0|The ESV is an awesome bible for many reasons.  too numerous to name.  I purchased one and my wife liked it so much that I bought her one just like it for christmas.
B0027Z837S|5.0|Some of the funniest concepts and scenes I have ever seen...Stephen Chow is on par with the genius of Mel Brooks with sheer absurdity and lightning jabs at your funny bone!  Classic schmaltzy KungFu undiscovered master with a devastatingly funny twist!  The version I first viewed was the early pre-dubbing version...and I HATE subtitles!  Didn't matter at all with this movie!  I watch it at least once a year and I still laugh out loud through most of the movie.  I thoroughly enjoy this movie time after time after time after time!  Great fantasy fight scenes, really funny and really well developed comical characters with some really clever twists!  Can't say enough about this movie...look, if you're low...you feel bad or down...watch this movie...it is fun!
0425252868|5.0|Such a great book, I bought another for my father and had it shipped to him in Kentucky.  Well written and well documented portrayal of &#34;the other side&#34;.  An exceptional book .
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is the perfect little word processor for a small tablet. I downloaded this on a Kindle Fire HD for which I also have a small Bluetooth keyboard. I don't do anything fancy on it, just some typing. It's nice not to have to haul around my laptop. :-)
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Good game for younger players with such cute animals.  I even set up LPS on my tablet so we can visit each others towns.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I downloaded this for my Android tablet, before I received a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas. It certainly did the trick and was nice to be able to carry my e-books around. This would work nicely on an android phone, I'm sure.
B000IDGDPA|1.0|A Portrait of Dorian Grey is one of my favorite works, and I had no idea originally that this movie were a work of Oscar's, but...I have to say this story is not only unbelievable but also morally repugnant. I found the acting to be fine: it's the plot that is lacking.<br /><br />Who could possibly believe that a 20 something man married to an attractive woman would go for a woman 20 years his elder? Or that a mother could be so base to (senselessly) - extort money from the husband of her daughter and destroy her happy marriage? Or that someone would want to marry a whore - even when caught whoring again? Or that the cheated on daughter would \\"forgive\\" the mistress over some sappy well-wishes?<br /><br />I was thinking to myself as I watched this - this is some guy's wet dream - that he could cheat on his wife, with her mother, have the mother condone it - and encourage him - and then, have his wife lay in bed telling him that she loves him and that the whore is a good woman. ?????<br /><br />MAYBE I could understand it if the man were a sobbing pile of remorse - but the formal apology he attempts to give her \\"behind closed doors\\" is ridiculous! I cannot imagine a man in love would be lacking feeling to that degree.<br /><br />The whole movie I thought she would get with the other guy - he did not seem like such a bad alternative!<br /><br />What a waste.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|When first using my Kindle Fire HD, I couldn't read PDFs. After downloading this, I am able to. Pretty easy. What more could you ask for?
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Cannot recommend this highly enough.  Action, intrigue, humor, even a little romance, all with a backdrop of a dystopian future and a myriad of references to 80s pop and geek culture.  Outstanding entertainment.  I can't wait for Cline's next novel.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|One reason you should ALWAYS tell someone where you're going and for how long you'll be there. Seriously though, this movie had me slapping my forehead at how little foresight the character played by James Franco had when he headed out into the wilderness alone. It just goes to show you that you can &#34;know&#34; your surroundings like the back of your hand, but you can never predict the unpredictable.<br /><br />James Franco did an excellent job portraying his character as he met the various stages of dehydration, delusions and eventually desperation so strong that he will do ANYTHING, literally, ANYTHING to survive.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, as it is not your typical story line, has some great acting, and is also based on a true story.
0802473156|5.0|I have only been married for 3 years, no serious problems in the relationship at all.  I found this book helpful and will be passing it on to many family members (who also don't seem to have any love/marriage issues).  It is just a good read to learn more about yourself and your partner and to help guarntee that you will continue to have a marriage full of Love.
B0086700CM|4.0|My, oh my, how many hours have I already wasted on this game? It's challenging and extremely addictive. Race from the temple to escape the evil mutant-monkeys and grab coins and power-ups as you go! Nothing more satisfying.<br /><br />The only qualm I have about this is that there aren't different &#34;levels&#34;. You're constantly running through the same temple course with the same obstacles. It wouldn't hurt to mix it up.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is extremely enjoyable... and FREE! :D
B005HSL626|5.0|I enjoy the fun and challenge of this game.  I would recommend it especially to seniors because it tests reflexes and challenges the mind.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Its really a great storyline, and very well done.  It was a great movie, and I like the raw humor that is dirty, but not over the top dirty.  It will make you laugh from the very beginning to the end.<br />You have to watch Ted.
1401941893|1.0|I found this book to be disappointing.  There was nothing inspirational that hasn't been said elsewhere by people more prominent. Ms Kerr seems to have taken it upon herself to market herself as a \\"health advocate\\", but I didn't find anything new or inspiring in this work.  The title of \\"Treasure Yourself\\" can be the only thing positive about the book but after that, it goes downhill.  Nice pictures, but not worth the price.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this not only because its free its so cool you can make your photos look like a amazing photo make your photos look amazing
B008IGP8RI|4.0|Wasn't as good as I had expected but there are some decent, and unusual songs on this. I found it enjoyable.
B007712XAU|5.0|Watching Downton Abbey made me so happy! The characters seem like friends and the story lines are compelling. It is beautiful to watch as well! From the sets to the fashion it is a real treat for the eyes. I highly recommend it as family friendly and expertly written and acted!
B003297I1U|5.0|Truck performed better than expected. My 5 year old granson loved getting this truck. The neighbor boy also loves playing with it.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|QUALITY & DEFINITION COULD BE BETTER.  SOUND WAS OK. COLOR WAS OK. PRICE WAS OK.  WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE OTHER '70'S MOVIES.
B006RUJST6|4.0|Nice story and glad it has a follow up. It's one of those stories where you'd like to hear more.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I like it very much so far,thank you. I used it for stocking stuvers,for the men in the family,they love it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I am often confused about what information is going through my feed.  I have thousands of ads from the Krazy Koupon Lady that i can't get rid of.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|My sister and both e recommend this boom to me and told me what an incredible author Gillian Flynn is. I couldn't put it down! He dark twist and vulnerable characters entangle you into the book. I can not wait to read her next book!
B000MD9UJC|5.0|thank you very much i love this product i recommended a 100% to everyone, its very good and you can buy.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is very good book to read. It has interesting twists. I would definitely recommend this to a friend as well as read this book again and look into other books from this author.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I LOVED this game &amp; hope here is a sequel. It played very well on the Kindle Fire and would highly recommend to fans of hidden object games; and story was cool also. Evil clowns !!!!
B00338QENI|4.0|I found this \\"story\\"  very interesting. (\\"Story\\" in quotes as I realize it is nonfiction). Although the book is scientific in nature, it is engaging and drew me in to Henrietta's family.  Deborah is fascinating to me as she was able to push herself to understand this scientific world with her limited education. I am eager to discuss with my book club!
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I love this movie, the lines are so funny and the characters are hilarious! Great movie for a rainy Sunday in the middle of February!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This collection brings together the first three games from That Game Company: Flow, Flower, and Journey. Each of these games is great in its own right but together they make an incredible package. The icing on the cake is that each of these games comes with a Dev diary, full game commentary, concept art, and soundtrack. As if that wasn't enough the collection also contains three gamejam prototypes, making it a great first chapter in the ongoing saga of That Game Company.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Beautiful graphics and best story line in a while... 5+ stars! Easy to follow but still a challenge! Don't mind the $3 fee.. at least u get to see awesome graphics with no glitches or freeze.. I'm looking for more games just like this! Highly recommend
1609611543|5.0|I am not all the way through it yet, but just after the 1st chapter I decided to remove wheat from my diet and I feel better than I have for years. Very grateful to be more informed from this book!
0062215507|5.0|it really surprised me because i didn't know there could be many little gifts in the book! they are all relevant to the movies and even the maps and the offer~~
B003DBOS7Y|4.0|Very emotional movie and certainly what I would rate as a chick flick and/or a tear jerker. Don't watch before bedtime;)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved my horse you can feed,groom,treat and lots of other things one thing that bothered me was that the game was oftenly asking if I wanted to spend my gems
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really do appreciate this app for checking weather and just keeping up with what's going on outside, since I spend so much time inside.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is good for people who have horses and want one because it teaches u wat a horse likes.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google always points me to the best and lowest price by providing a list<br />of vendors for research.  This gives me a good comparison of pricing.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Interesting characters and story combine with a fluid writing style to create a book that you simply can't stop reading.
B00003CXBK|3.0|I purchased this movie because my kids liked Totoro so much.  I thought it have the same innocent story as Totoro but to my surprise there were a few adult situations and graphics that I didn't like.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|which was good but not as great as some of the others.<br /><br />Aloysius Pendergast has to be one of the most interesting characters ever written. The whole history that Preston and Child have built up over the course of the books is also very interesting.<br /><br />Unfortunately this book seemed to be written following the usual Pendergast formula. Luckily this works really well so the book did keep me turning pages after I first got really into it.<br /><br />Pendergast has gotten out of several dire situations before, but I think the ones he finds in this book really push the against the limit of suspension of disbelief. Although he is the great and powerful Pendergast, he still is only just one guy.<br /><br />One thing that sets this series apart from others is the multi-book story arcs. This always keep the reading interesting as we slowly find out stuff that we were wondering about three or four books ago.<br /><br />Of course I will read the next Pendergast book. I just hope it is as good as some of the others have been.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Not as good as other books in the series, but a good transition between pivotal plot lines.  The writing was less fluid and lighthearted than in previous books in the series.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We liked this movie because it had the old fashioned aspects of good and evil what happens when you make bad choices and it is ok to be afraid. Family is there when you need them all you have to do is ask. There was not one minute of this little movie when I wanted to hide my face and cover the children's eyes.
B003B02O3C|5.0|I have a short attention span,so this book held me thru the entire book..&#34;The Rainmaker&#34; by John Grisham..GREAT..I enjoy suspense
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This app is fun for a while until it deletes all your progress.I would highly recommend that you don't get this app.
0736092269|5.0|I do a lot of free weight training and his book is very informative. I love how it illustrate the exercise for each muscle group. It helps me to stay injury free.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|The Blade Itself was a very enjoyable experience. I picked it up with the caution that the violence is, well, violent; however, what I found was that, while the violence is pretty gruesome, I was feeling the blows with the characters. When they were winded and exhausted, I was winded and exhausted. Joe Abercrombie did a great work of making the scrapes and fights feel like a brawl should: chaos, bruises, blood, and definitely a few fatalities.<br /><br />This book is not all action though. As a matter of fact, there are several periods where the book takes a slower tempo, but it never feels like trudging through mud. No, on the contrary, as I reader I could definitely tell this book is building up to something bigger, which is where the end of the book comes in. I have not read many books where the last 150 to 200 pages had be burning through them like this one only to have such a calm, somewhat abrupt conclusion. This is done on purpose I think to give you a moment to catch your breath before starting into book two.<br /><br />I gave this book five stars because it's simply fun to read, but be prepared that once you reach the end you might find more money jumping out of your wallet as you purchase &#34;Before They Are Hanged&#34; (Book Two).
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is my new favorite show, I couldn't stop watching it... so awesome.  I can't wait to watch season 2!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I seriously loved all three books. Very sad they had to end. I feel like I need to know what's going to continue to happen next.
030758836X|5.0|What I Liked: 1) I loved the way this was written. Written like diary entries that recap the day or part of the day that Nick has experienced. I think it was the best way for the reader to get into the book and to piece together the details of what has been happening. 2) Amy. The missing wife. It's hard for me to explain her without giving a huge part of the book away, but I thought her character was great. (For those of you who've read it, I didn't think she was a great in a \\"I want to be like her\\" kind of way. Great in a \\"she made the story really interesting\\" kind of way.) 3) The mystery and suspense. My family is really into crime shows, so we watch a lot of those. I always enjoy the ones where we (the viewers) know more about what is going on than the characters in the show. So I liked that aspect of the story. Since we got several different perspectives in the book, not just Nick's, the readers get information that Nick doesn't get, or that the police don't have. Instead of the reader having to wait for the police to solve whatever crime this is, we can make our own conclusions. It makes me feel smart when I can solve it (before the fictional characters). Wow, I have some high standards, don't I? Being smarter than fictional people. 4) The crazy, insane ending. This ending makes the whole book worth it. Again, I won't say much to avoid giving anything away, but I was fascinated.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like: Nothing!<br /><br />Overall Thoughts: If you like mystery, step outside your YA comfort zone to give this one a read. It definitely deserves the awards it has won. Gillian Flynn has a gift for throwing curves at you that you never expect and for pulling together a fascinating story with a killer ending. I'm keeping her on my list of authors to watch!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Bought this as an electric sharpener that I bought (on AMAZON) said that you shouldn't sharpen serrated blades with it, and I have two pocket knives with serrated blades.  Very inexpensive, portable and seems to get the job done fine.  Only used it once but it seems to have put a nice sharp edge to one of my pocket knives (a Bear Gylis knife I bought here on AMAZON a year ago -- very very fine knife -- highly recommended -- Gerber Bear Grylls Folding Sheath Knife... other knife I recently bought is also VERY VERY nice and bought it on AMAZON as well -- Kershaw Ken Onion Tactical Blur Folding Knife with Speed Safe).
B0085TKAW6|5.0|One of my most favouite authors.  A power sequel to Fall of Giants.  A brilliant book with both sad and happy aspects showing life during WW11.  I did not want it to end and am looking forward to his next novel.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I watched the movie, Lea Miserables, a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to recall the story as the original version. It was a good choice. I can definitely say that it is one of my favorite novels.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|This is the first Reacher book i have read and it sucked me into the world of Jack Reacher where i have found myself looking for other novels on this character.  Every corner there is a different twist.  Well worth the read
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't going to get this book. So glad I did. I could not stop reading it. Very easy to just sink into the story.
B000000992|5.0|Good stuff. Cant beat it. Extremely stoked that they recorded this analog as opposed to digitally as they did with Lateralus and subsequently released on vinyl. In other words, the mix sounds great. I dig
B000XO2R22|5.0|An absolute delight to have Beck again in my phone!<br />Slow, soft and deep... you couldn't ask for much more!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Dont see what all the hype was about the being Tool's weakest release. You can tell the band is taking different directions and Mayrnard Keegan is taking his song writing to another level. Thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the personal subject matter & the opening up emotionally of a very enigmatic band.
0345529057|4.0|As decribed ! No problems with the pages ! Already on book # 2 Books arrived in no time !!
B00004YLIU|5.0|Had to repurchase this after my last copy was pilfered. the reissue sounds great & although not always a fan of 10&#34; records (partly b/c I can be anal with my record stack that they don't always line up correctly ;)  I still love it. This is easily one of my favorite releases from the band.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a fun book to read!! I will watch for more from this author and look forward to more.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|I loved this book.This is a story about family relationships  through different periods of time  and differnt locations.The switching between different characters and different eras can be confusing at first, but as you become more familiar with who is who and where and when, the story reads like a mystery novel.You keep guessing what does this mean or what is going to happen next.It is exciting as the family history unfolds  with twists and turns that keep on coming.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|it is interesting and hard at the same time. i would like to be able to get my dailey bonuses thou i need more gas
034580404X|5.0|I am really enjoying the books. I would suggest ths for adults only, ppl over 18. Great entertainment reading. Can't wait for the next series.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|My daughter and I love this show.  I got this to watch on snowy nights over and over again - can't wait to start.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I like this book because it is great.<br />I dislike it because of the main character doesn't want children. Thanks.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Love this show, my daughter and I are hooked and I have this for those snowy nights this winter to watch all the shows again and again.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|you tube the best scents the tv broadcasting ever have seen ever have been used in my life time ever have been made
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton is my favorite author of this genre and I loved this book!  It was somewhat different from her others (The Distant Hours being my favorite) but she kept to her masterful storytelling talent of telling a story within a story. I was caught up in the two distinct time lines and characters and held my breath til the very end.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a great book. For people who love action and adventure, I would. Highly reccomend trying this book. Rick riordon is a great author: you feel like you r standing right next 2 percy
B000IOM1YG|4.0|This is a terrific piece of 70s musical art.  Alan Parsons was always creating something offbeat that was still able to be enjoyed by many people.  This disc includes demos of many songs on the original lp, and they are interesting.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|tis fun but needs more ways to get diamonds and more stuff to do with your horse. entertaining none the less.
B00005K9QP|3.0|Controversial? Why?    Mayall comes across here as being one very earnest cat, even if he sings like a goose about to be turned into Christmas dinner: \\"Little Girl\\" shows him to be a caring, anti-sexist bluesman, but his \\"sensitivity\\" gets him in trouble when he totally guts \\"Parchman Farm\\" of Mose Allison's rancid humor and tries to make it a \\"statement\\" about racism instead.    Clapton's delicious, creamy foghorn tone is given its public debut, but unfortunately so is his near-priestly, rather self-serving  reverence for the legend of Robert Johnson, which later got HIM in trouble when he tried slow suicide with H and booze. \\"Rambling on My Mind\\" sounds more like \\"Prufrock's Blues\\" -- \\"Do I dare disturb the universe?\\" Dave Ray's jackhammer version of this on the lttle-known gem \\"Snaker's Here\\" (see my review thereof) makes Clapton sound lost in about half the recording time. We had to wait for Cream to hear what Clapton was really capable of. Here he's just a very good studio guitarist.    And the drum solo in \\"What'd I Say\\" is STILL one of the dullest ever recorded.    Paul Butterfield, John Hammond, Dave Ray, the Blues Project, and Bonnie Raitt all recorded punchier stuff than this, because they didn't sound so bloody academic. They were American, after all.    What this album really proves is that Rory Gallagher's \\"Live in Europe\\" (q.v.) really WAS the finest blues-rock album ever recorded by anyone British. This one's a must-have for Claptonologists and enjoyable for nostalgia buffs, but not much more.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie is awesome!!  Lots of action, car chases, fights, etc.  The plot is also pretty good.  It sucks you in quickly, and you are in for a wild ride!  Guys will like this movie a lot!  Ladies may not enjoy it as much.
B0054JURZA|5.0|iTunes now says I have listened to each track 11 times. This album is an experience, not since some of my first 'WTF' experiences with music since I was young has an album made me feel like this. The high end with his voice, the constant building up and falling off. The 12-40 instruments used on every track. The long lead ins, beautiful scenery depicted by the lyrics; Bon Iver wants you to feel what he felt, not just tell you a pretty story.<br /><br />Top 10 albums for me. :-)
1476719071|3.0|This book does a pretty good job of trying to recreate that going back to high school feel that you get from many recent books, beginning with the Twilight series.<br /><br />We've got Abby Abernathy, a misfit who has a shameful history that gets revealed mid-book. And then we have Travis Maddox, another misfit - a boy who's mother passed away leaving a house full of boys to fend for themselves. Of course he's angry - and of course he fights. He's got tattoos and an attitude. The two collide.<br /><br />And the rest of the book is the two of them almost getting together, only to break apart, and then almost get back together again and then they really get together and then - surprise! - break up again.<br /><br />I can see some mothers getting outraged with some of the behavior \\"glorified\\" here - shot after shot after shot on her birthday followed by a night over the toilet - (presented like that must be love - he held her hair!) but that is unfortunately, the behavior that can be expected of this age group.<br /><br />I liked the obsession with each other and the promise of more to come.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|Beautiful album. The entire album is good, it's not just &#34;Skinny Love&#34; and &#34;For Emma&#34;. The mixing and story of the album is great.
B006QS07IK|4.0|We all know the basic story - a doctor unleashes a monster on the world after creating it from scratch parts and some electrical magic.<br /><br />This original novel takes us right into the head of that \\"mad\\" doctor.<br /><br />What led up to the creation? Why was he so obsessed with the creation? What made him turn on his progeny?<br /><br />And, we also are let right into the mind of the creature, who, abandoned, makes his own way in the world, rejected, scorned, feared. How does he survive? How does he learn? Who does he love? And what does he do to try and influence the good doctor to make this right?<br /><br />It's all here.<br /><br />Mary Shelley was only 18 when she wrote her novel. Her vocabulary and prose are amazing for someone so young.<br /><br />The story begins in an unusual way - a man writing to an unknown loved one describes his journey leading up to a sighting of the \\"monster\\".<br /><br />We're then transported into the life of the young Dr. Frankenstein, writing his long journal entry about his fateful decision to create life from \\"nothing\\". He foreshadows terrible things, of which most of them come true.<br /><br />We meet Dr. Frankenstein's family - those he loved and grew up with. His father, brothers, and beloved adopted cousin, Elizabeth, whom he later vows to marry.<br /><br />They all play their parts in this macabre story. All throughout, we think, \\"Stop it, Dr. Frankenstein. You must be able to find a way to stop this madness.\\" But, events rush headlong just to where the doctor predicts they will.
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you like Solitaire, this is a fun, easy game.  Just to pass the time while waiting.  I recommend it.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I bought this book following the recent Jack Reacher movie with Tom Cruise.  The book is an enjoyable read and is far more engaging than the movie.<br /><br />On the positive side, the action is reasonably fast paced and the book is an easy read. Reacher's character is probably difficult for the average person to relate to, but I seemed to draw a connection nonetheless. There are some twists and turns and I found it difficult to put the book down until it was completed. However, once the plot starts to play out the ending becomes predictable.  All in all a fun way to occupy a quiet afternoon or two.
1449415881|4.0|My son set this calendar by his computer and it gives him some laughs.  I would recommend this, especially as a funny office calendar.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is addictive just like when I used to go to the StateFair every year and play this game till all my money was gone!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love Sci-Fi movies and this set fits this genre perfectly.  The movies have just the right amount of Sci-Fi and horror to make them compelling to watch.  Sigourney Weaver plays Riley to a &#34;T&#34;.  With each move she brings a new facet to the character.  It is amazing how the alien is depicted - it isn't hard to imagine that the aliens could be actually real.
6305428050|5.0|Very funny movie, and great to watch with the family ( : It's a movie that you can watch more then once, which we have.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I originally watched Avatar in 2D and thought it was great.  Then I saw it in 3D.  What a difference.  The flying scenes were absolutely amazing and made me feel like I was flying right along with the characters.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The story,although not always factual to the Von Trapp family, is still wonderful. A lot of literary license was used to make the movie what it was, but that does not detract from it for me. If one wants to know the real story of the Von Trapp's, they can always research it. Julie Andrews is always wonderful to watch, and this is one of her best.
B006H5120E|5.0|Beautiful love story intermixed with the drama of the Titanic sinking.  It tells a tale of the passage of the Titanic and the possibilities of what happened on the ship after hitting the iceberg.  The movie is wonderfully scripted, going from the modern day and sonar imaging of the wreckage to the telling of the story, then back to the wreckage site at the end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfect for the Kindle Fire. If you have no other game available, you have to have solitaire!<br />You can't go wrong with this one.
B0087X728K|4.0|I have this between an i7 3770k at stock speed and a corsair h100i push/pull. I'm getting about 63c at full load on the hottest core running prime95 for 15 min. Before i was getting about 68c with stock compound.
B000KITQK2|5.0|One of the best, useful, live and recording tools I have ever bought. You can use this as a preamp for pretty much anything, I use it for bass and acoustic guitar. It sounds great and works well. Its built strong even if it is plastic and it has a lot of useful features. A great buy for any active musician.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am sad to say I had never heard of this author but I can assure you his name will not be forgotten. This book had an<br />amazing story and kept me enthralled from start to finish.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. Felt every emotion possible! Will read this again! Recommend it to everyone. Such a sweet story.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|it is fantastic! Love Kylie! I should have purchased this cd years ago. I have not stopped listening to this since I received it.
B009DH371K|5.0|Utterly stunning cinematography and sound, thanks to a top-notch crew of Eastern European filmmakers.  The band was in great form.  This may be the best concert video I have ever seen.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's cool and all, my sister seems to enjoy it but there could be more activities to do without having to wait or pay
B000008JUM|5.0|Got a used copy of this cd because it contains one of the most beautiful U2 songs ever recorded, Night and Day, which I haven't been able to find in it's unmixed version on any other album or in single version.
034580404X|5.0|This series is one of the best I ever read I do hope they do a book on cristian het more into his side of everything
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love it . . . love it . . . love it!  BUT, gotta warn you, it can become addictive . . . but what a fun addiction
B005544V6A|5.0|I don't know what I'm gonna do after I complete Season 2 and have to wait a whole week for each episode of Season 3! LOVE, LOVE, LOOOOVE this show! Smart, SEXY and funny!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|The heavy use of medical terminology made it hard to follow in parts. I enjoyed the parts when he talks about going to &#34;the core&#34; and what he recalled of that experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great way to learn more about horses. It is also fun to play . I recommend it to older kids who can read well.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I was convinced of his trip to heaven.  He did not have to go into all of the medical jargon.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|Vincente Minneli's masterpiece is a feast for the eyes, ears, and heart!  The music will stay in your head for days after watching this movie.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I like the way that this is told in a first person and how the narrator does so.  The book is a great thriller/mystery and genuinely keeps you guessing.  It starts of slow but then gets really good.  Lee Child spins a good yarn, however I have 2 complaints that keep this from being a 5 star review.  Jack Reacher is essentially this all around bad-ass due to his MP experience.  HOWEVER, the things that Reacher says, does, and concludes through-out this book are nuts and anyone who's been in the Military whether it be Army or Marine Corps knows that a military MP is not going to be capable of this kind of stuff.  My other major gripe with this book is that many things in this book are just LONG stretches in coincidences and convenient things that leave you scratching your head.  Honestly, those would be major gripes for me to give a book 2 or 3 stars, so seeing that I'm giving this a four, that should let you know right there how much the books strengths muscle through those weaknesses
B00006AFF5|5.0|i have always liked Dr. Seuss, this one is my most favorite because it's a Christmas movie and it turns out very nice as well, i like Jim Carrey and he does a very good job in this movie.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|After reading Old Mans war, i was highly anticipating this.  However I waited a while before reading this because personally I like to take a break between reading multiple novels in a series, lets me feel refreshed towards reading it.  Anyway, this book again exceeded my expectations, as I generally don't read much science fiction.  Yes, I would agree with most that it doesnt reach the same heights as old mans war, but thats OK, because that book was amazing.  This book is as well, It just isn't AS good as old mans war.  Once again, Scalzi writes this book at a quick pace which makes it highly entertaining and fits well with the subject matter.  A big thing I like about reading Scalzi novels is the humor.  Every time i read a scalzi book i know there are going to be some laugh out loud moments, and this is no different.  The action is great, the comedy is there and the plot is fun.  Pick this up, and don't compare it to old mans war.  Just enjoy this book for the fun that it is.
B001I8A76A|5.0|Honestly with Pink you can't go wrong. This album is fun, passionate, emotional with a pinch of don't give a f***. Overall great buy
B007V5CF5K|4.0|This is just the kind of game I like. Not too hard, not too easy. The tasks all connected so each completed piece had to be used in some way. Good story, good graphics, and I will play it again.<br /><br />So, why did I give it four stars instead of five? Because as others have stated, the game keeps crashing. It's not a big problem. When it comes back up seconds later, just press play again, although you may have to pick up the last two or three pieces again. The first time I played it, there was one big crash that I couldn't recover from. I had to re-download the game and start over. Hope it doesn't happen again.<br /><br />On to Snark Busters 2.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|&#34;Hopeless&#34; is hopeless- Not for my taste at all.---Was ordered by mistake--My fault, That is all I have to say.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Outstanding graphics and easy game play. Highly recommend . Two thumbs up. I am considering buying the whole  game. Have fun.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This DVD was action-packed and depicted slave trade in England years ago, how it was stopped, and how the song<br />Amazing Grace came about.
0425252868|5.0|This WWII story brings you the storys of two foes, during and after that major war.<br />To have the German perspective is eye opening.  A must read for WWII studies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is the best book I have ever read. You will never ever want to put the book down.
B00425S1H8|5.0|After plugging the cable in for the first time, the device driver installed quickly and without issue, without even the need for the included CD. This device enabled me to easily transfer data from some outmoded equipment to my netbook (via-USB) while doing field data collection--a huge time saver. I highly recommend this product for others forced to integrate older devices with newer ones.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|This game has stalled at the position I noted above....enlarging window is open and won't close, there is no action I can take at this time (I checked the map) and because the enlarging window is open, I am unable to move from this location. I am stuck. Hoping big fish games can help me!  I purchased the extended version of the game.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|What a beautiful story.  Felt like I was ready poetry on every page.  The descriptions were colorful and the formal writing made me feel as though I were in the late 1800s.  Enjoyed every page of this very unique story line.  It was different than anything I have read in a while and would recommend to other readers.  Let the magic take you away and enjoy the ride!
0345803485|3.0|I am still trying to understand how this was such a huge seller.  The first one was easy to read although unrealistic with everyone so good looking or rich or both.  The last two in the series slowed down for me as it contained more unrealistic drama and the author lapses into British speak.  The story is focused on Americans in their 20's living in Seattle yet they say things like 'let me fetch you some water'.  In my head I started reading it with a British accent.  If you can find these used and you are bored then it passes the time.
1421550644|5.0|I bought this without ever seeing it in person, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It's great. The books are really nice, very high quality. It's a great collectors piece.

B00A1XIXM8|5.0|Bad Religion is one of the greatest punk bands in history, and decades after they first got together they're still capable of putting out amazing albums. A strong combination of energy, melody and clever songwriting is hard to find, but Bad Religion have it in spades, and it shines through in this newest album \\"True North\\".<br /><br />This album is quite the breath of fresh air after the band's previous release. 2010's \\"The Dissent of Man\\" wasn't a bad album by any means, but compared to other recent works from the band, it seemed to lack a creative spark, like everyone felt it was time to make an album even if it wasn't fully ready. \\"True North\\" absolutely feels inspired, charged with energy and featuring excellent songwriting; this album deserves to be up there with some of the band's best.<br /><br />Many of the songs are noticeably short, most of them being two minutes or less, and only one being longer than three. This leads to some fast, driving punk rock, with songs like the title track \\"True North\\", the surprisingly catchy \\"Land of Endless Greed\\", the blazingly fast \\"Vanity\\", or one of the album's premier tunes \\"My Head is Full of Ghosts\\". On the flipside, you can find songs that still drive themselves forward while providing excellent melody, such as \\"Crisis Time\\", \\"Changing Tides\\" and what might be the album's best track \\"Dept. of False Hope\\".<br /><br />The album also takes some creative liberties to deliver some unique audio experiences, like with the slower-paced but highly melodic \\"Hello Cruel World\\" or \\"Dharma and the Bomb\\" which is a distinctly different sound from previous songs. At the same time, there are some highly catchy songs that feel refreshingly familiar yet also not stale, such as \\"Past is Dead\\" or \\"Nothing to Dismay\\". The album explores all sorts of avenues in its 36-minute runtime, but is structured well enough that it doesn't feel disjointed or schizophrenic either. There are some missteps on this album, such as the repetitive, pointless novelty harmonies in \\"In Their Hearts is Right\\" or the weak, uninspired melody of \\"Popular Consensus\\", but even Bad Religion at their worst are better than many groups at their best.<br /><br />On the whole, this album showcases Bad Religion at their strongest, exploring new territory with powerful punk rock energy while maintaining the thoughtful lyrics and clever melodies that the band is known for. After 33 years of making music, this band somehow continues putting out music as good as they ever have, an incredible fear for anybody. If you're a punk rock fan, \\"True North\\" is exactly what you're looking for.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is great, but does anyone know how to beat the final boss on Oscorp Tower?  I can't seem to figure that out.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love watching this show whenever I can.  It is almost hysterical and I can't wait until the next episode airs.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I gave  it four only because it was slow paced but was still an awesome book! I am on to read the next one :)
1451662432|3.0|While my husband read the book and enjoyed some of the insight - it is a long book.  He also was surprised at the way Arnold chose to handle the Marie protion of his life.  Never said a bad word about her - only that he was wrong. Honestly in this day and age.  Refreshing.
B007BZM30M|5.0|Hey I just met you, and this is crazy, but this song is catchy and I can't stop!  No Seriously it's driving my wife Crazy!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a great app for free, with the ability to upgrade if needed.  I found it to be bright, even when toned down, but it offered exactly what I needed.
0596009208|5.0|Clear writing makes it easy to understand core concepts, lots of visual aids and little side projects to keep your mind and keyboard busy.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Whether HD or regular viewing, the Kindle Fire shows all movies wonderfully! I love that you can buy just one episode at a time.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie was well done in the Doctor Seuss style. Really funny and will definitely watch again and again! Great CG!
B0041CGP02|2.0|Simply not crazy about the songs and composition. Overall, I would n ot characterize myself as a Bon Jovi fan.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie was non stop action. The references to other movies the cast played in was funny and quirky as well. Must see!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|,Really fun and always gives me something to do.  Funny too.  Just love the graphics and I really recommend getting this game.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|This movie is a classic for a reason. There are super funny parts, sad parts, a wonderful musical for the whole family!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|great and fun ect. but,  difficult . the pigs will never die! crush them one time 2, 3, or even 4 times
B003VS0CXS|5.0|This movie has been sparking the imagination of children for generations. Dick Van Dyke is a great actor for the part and it is a whimsical classic all should see at least once!
B007HACDLK|4.0|the Last Man Standing is a typical action book but I like all of Vince Flynn's books with the exception of Kill Shot. I enjoy action books and I enjoy his style of writing.
B007FXLWKW|5.0|This movie is an excellent example of how a CG/Live action film should be done. The CG was good and well done. The story was awesome. I will never look at a jellybean the same way again!
B001NHNG64|4.0|All that glitters is not gold. Some who lead should not.  Teacher confronts demons, inside,and out.  A good read with with enough twists  to satisfy  any contortions.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I bought the original Persona 4 when it was released for the PS2. Since I couldn't find my old PS2 in working order, I ended up buying an old backwards compatible PS3 just for that game. I played through twice (which is something I rarely do with any game these days). So, when P4G was announced, I was excited to catch the new content and I was completely impressed - not only with the new content, but the improved game mechanics as well.<br /><br />And, by the way, this is the only game I have for the PS Vita and the only reason I own a PS Vita at that. I think that speaks my love for this iteration of the franchise.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|The Young Victoria is a beautiful true love story.  Victoria is courageous and Prince Albert's patience, humility and commitment to Victoria endures him to any woman's heart.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read even though I've seen a couple of movies based on his book.  Enjoyed the book though I don't see Josh Duhamel as the lead character.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was highly recommended to me by a good friend. I now want to thank that friend, for it is a book that has touched me and left a lasting impression! It was such a delightful and heartwarming read! Perfect for the every day dog lover, who believes that dogs have a voice and are family. I promise you won't be disappointed!
B000OCXI3K|4.0|I liked this story, she writes well and draws you in.  It was a pleasant read, it is predictable in some ways, there were a few surprises but it was a good read.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this show and just can't get enough of it. It is so much fun to watch and guess what will happen next!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All the books were amazing, I don't have a lot of time to read but when I did I didn't want to put the book down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great series, we have become addicted. We just started watching and are trying to catch up during the mid season break!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great version of solitude, especially for free. Has every option for the game you could ever want. You will definitely enjoy it.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|Not as deep as twilight but cut from the same cloth. Kept me interested. I plan to read the sequels.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Beautiful! Kinsella has done it again. With her wit, her amazing capacity to roll out scenarios of such outrageous abandon, and yet remain so pure and honest with her characters-I am stunned! Her ideas are so sweetly beautiful and cinematic that it like watching a film. Her work is so perfectly human, I can't help but wish it were all happening to me. Every gruesome detail. This Book was no exception. Emma is a delight, I'd be her flatmate in an instant if she weren't a figment of Kinsella' s imagination.
0451418441|5.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth I knew I had to get this book.  The characters continued to captivate my desire to engage in their story. Well the worth the read and I would love to read another continuing the saga.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I have to say I struggled in the beginning with what I thought was amateurish dialogue.  But perseverance led me to understand the modern nature of the book and as I continued, the sheer tragedy of the life involved had me gripped.  I loved the way I felt I was in on a secret that the lead character didn't know, but that I had worked out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is always challenging and fun to play.  Game of chance and how the cards fall.  You just never know.
B00992CF6W|5.0|from what I herd it's good so I will check back later great so I will be back. best times by.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Great band.Very original lyrics and true to their live music performances as well. Can't wait for their next album to come out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you love horses, you will love this app. I would recommend it for your children. It will give them a fun app to play with.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|i rate this becaus3e bettle juice is a great movie and to get it for this price is great also
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fantastic read, one you will have a hard time putting down. It will keep you guessing throughout. This is one you will want to pass on.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|The animation, the story line and the characters make this movie a timeless favorite.  My son and I can watch this movie everyday and not get tired of it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|One of the best books ever!!! Great plot and ending. Kids all ages will love reading about this amazing adventure!!!
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Amazon Prime makes things so easy. I love how easy it was to rent this movie. An old classic like this was great to share with my grandgirls.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Don't buy this case.  Fake.  Brittle plastic, not the softer rubberized version of real Lifeproof case.  Looks good and feels good at first but the brittle plastic will crack and you will not be protected.  Pay the extra - go through Lifeproof.
B007EE564U|4.0|This Mitch Rapp story is much like the others in the series and follows a similar line. Rapp is confronted by enemies within and outside the US services. The setting is in Afghanistan and the politics and plot are simplistic but typical Flynn. Most problems are solved by a good shootout, though Rapp gets up from his hospital bed and saves the day as per usual. The literature is not high quality but Flynn readers are not expecting that - they enjoy the familiarity of Rapp and good escapist story telling. Yhis book is what was expecyed and is a good rollicking yarn but not a more! enjoyable.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Now that my DVD just arrived, I can invite friends over to see this wonderful film. It was the best film surprise of the summer for me -- looked intriguing and maybe a little quirky.  LITTLE did I know I'd fall in love with Rodriguez, his story and his music! What a gift - and inspiration - it is for everyone who sees it. I'm telling my friends as little as possible about this film before we watch it, and can't wait to observe their delight. Fingers crossed that Searching for Sugarman takes the Oscar for best documentary (was nominated two weeks ago)!
1603429999|5.0|I first became aware of Margaret Radcliffe from her articles in &#34;Knit'n Style&#34; magazine. She is able to instruct without making it seem the property of experts--the illustrations and directions are clear and concise.
0399226907|5.0|My grandchildren love reading this book and looking at the pictures.  It is well made with sturdy gloss cardboard pages.  The story is cute and has a happy ending.
0312427999|5.0|This book was recommended by a social worker for my son. After I checked it out from the library, I realized that in order to read this packed with information book, I needed to buy it. Now, it is waiting for me to pay attention to it!
0920668372|3.0|The book has cute pictures.  The story starts off cute and funny but I don't care for the end when the mother is old and sick.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|We may not be able to go to London for an Il Divo concert, but we can bring London and Il Divo into our home, sit back, pretend we are there, and take a break without missing a beat. Production values are great. The additional interviews with how the selections were made offered another important insight into how these selected the songs and how the songs appealed to them and then to us.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Graphics were good and so was story line. Sometimes puzzles were a bit tedious. But domino games were fun. Not a bad game for price.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The reviews above this one are for a film titled Quartet but not the film pictured above them and directed by Hoffman. His film is not yet available on DVD through Amazon. Amazon does not mess up often but when they do it's a beauty.
